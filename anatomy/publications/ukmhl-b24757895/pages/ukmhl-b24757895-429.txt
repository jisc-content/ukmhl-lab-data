803 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMH. semi-niembranosus and internal lateral ligament, from which it is separated by a bursa, and it forms part of the inner boundaiy of the popliteal space. Action.—It flexes the knee, rotates the tibia out, and assists the sar- torius in flexing the leg and drawing it inwards. It is also an adductor of the thigh. Acting from below, it will assist in maintaining the pelvis on the fennu-. N&fve.—The obturator. The Pectineus is the highest of these muscles, and is placed at the anterior, ui)per, and inner aspects of the thigh passing from the pelvis to the inner side of the femur. It is flat and quadrangular, and arises from Fig. 285.—Diagram oi' musclks on the inner side 01? the thigh, the ilio-pectineal line, and from the triangular smooth surftxce of bOne in front of that line between the ilio-pectineal eminence and spine of the I>ubes, also from a tendinous prolongation of Grimbernat's ligament, which is attached to the pubic crest and which is continuous with the fascia covering the anterior sm-face of the muscle (ligament of Cooper). The fibres pass down, back, and out, to be inserted by a flat tendon, about two inches wide, into the femiu- behind tlie small troclianter, and into the upper part of the rough line which leads from the trochanter mint)r to the

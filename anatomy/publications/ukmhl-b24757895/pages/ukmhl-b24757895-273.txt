DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMP. ^37 from a depression on the inner side of the coronoid process, and by a jitroiii? aponeurosis from the upjier two-thirds of the posterior border of the uhia, and from the ulnar half of the interosseous membrane. These fibres form a fleshy belly of large size, which ends in four tendons that pass under the annular ligament beneath the tendons of the flexor sublimis, and after piercing the sublimis, are inserted into the bases of the last phalanges. The tendon for the index finger is separated from the others above the wrist, the rest being connected together by tendinous slips and oellular tissue as far as the palm.

Anterior surface. Relations,—Superficially, with the flexor sublimis, flexor carpi ulnai-ie, median nerve, and ulnar vessels and nerves; deeply, with the ulna, inter- osseous membrane, and pronator quadratus; its inner border is in relation with the flexor carpi ulnaris ; and its outer or radial border with the flexor longus pollicis. the anterior interosseous vessels and nerve intervening. Actions.—It flexes the distal phalanges, and then bends the wi-ist, but it does not act on the last phalanges after the second have been bent by

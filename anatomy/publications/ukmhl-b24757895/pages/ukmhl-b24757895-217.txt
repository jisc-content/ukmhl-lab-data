181 DISSHCTIOX OF THE UPPER LIMB. fho (rank. In both cases the head of the humerus rolls down in the irli'noid cavity, in the first motion, and up in t,he latter. The scapula moves but slightly in these movements. In Abduction the lower part of the capsule is rendered tense, and the head of the humerus descends to the lower larger part of the glenoid fossa, and projects beyond it against the capsule. Extreme abduction being limited by the contact of the great tuberosity with the outer margin of the acromion, dislocation downwards (into the axilla) is liable to occur if this movement be forced to an extreme. In Adduction, which is limited by the contact of the humerus with the trunk, the lower part of the capsule is rendered again lax, and the head of the bone rises on the glenoid fossa. Extreme adduction, in front or behind the chest, is checked by the upper, front and back portions of the capsule and by its accessory ligaments, which are rendered tense. The muscles attached to the tuberosities also check these motions. Fio. lo-t.—Ligaments on- left shoulder joint and betm'een clavicle and SCAPULA. In Circumduction, which may be said to be a combination of flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction, the humerus describes a cone whose base is at the fingers, and apex at the glenoid cavity. It is of course freest with the arm slightly separated from the side. Rotation.—This is of two kinds, internal and external, and the motions of the head and shiift of the humerus vary. Jn Internal Rotation the humeral head passes from before back, across the glenoid cavity, and projects behind, rendering the back of the capsule tense ; the shaft at the same time moves forwards around a line which passes on its inner side from the cartilaginous portion of the head to the inner condyle, the great tuberosity being turned forwards. In fJxterval RoLaii.on the motions are reversed. The hend rolls forwards, projecting in front, :ni(l rendering the anterior part of the

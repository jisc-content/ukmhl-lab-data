DISSECTION OF TUE LOWER LIMB. 641 poUicis, is almost always given otf from the extensor proprius, though it has been found sepai'ate. Wood found it in half the subjects examined. When present it is usually inserted into the fu'st phalanx of the great toe, or into the iirst metatarsal, or into both. Actions.—It extends the phalanges of the great toe, and then flexes the ankle. If the foot be fixed, it can draw the tibia forwards. Nerve.—The anterior tibial. The Extensor Longus Digitorum is a long flattened penniform muscle, and is fleshy above and tendinous below. It arises from the external tuberosity of the tibia, from the front of the head and upper three-fourths of the anterior narrow part of the inner siu-face of the fibula, from a small pari of the interosseous membrane, and from the deep fascia and inter- muscular septa. The muscular fibres pass obliquely down and in, to three Fig. 420.—Muscles and tendons in front of right leg and on dorsum oe foot. The transverse piece ot the dorsal fascia keeping the tendons in place is shown. tendons which, with the peroneus tertius, pass in a separate compartment through the annular ligament, the innermost tendon dividing into two. It then crosses the dorsum of the foot, and is inserted into the dorsal aspects of the second and third phalanges of the four outer toes. These tendons have the same arrangement on the toes as the extensors of the fingers. The three inner tendons are joined on the first phalanx at their outer sides by a tendon from the extensor brevis digitorum, and also by an aponeurotic expansion from the interossei and lumbricales which covers the dorsum of the first phalanx. At the anterior part of this phalanx, this aponeurosis divides into three slips, a middle and two lateral. The middle one ig inserted into the dorsal aspect of the base of the second phalanx, and the two lateral unite on the dorsal surface of the second phalanx and

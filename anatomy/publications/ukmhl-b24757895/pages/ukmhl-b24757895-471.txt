DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 436 accompanying the mviscular arteries. One of these passes beneath the gastroeuemius and suppHes the soleus on its cutaneous surface. Another supplies the phmtaris and both heads of the gastrocnemius; and yet a third may be traced round the lower border of the popliteus to enter its interior aspect. Its continuation to the back of the leg is called the posterior tibial. The External Saphenotos Nerve is its largest branch, and is cutaneous to the leg and foot. It lies on the gastrocnemius beneath the fascia, and will be subsequently seen piercing the deep fascia of the leg about its middle. The External Popliteal or Peroneal nerve will be found, as just said, Vast. ext. Great sciatic Add. mag. Biceps (cut) Ext. popl. Cutn».

It is considerably smaller than the inner branch of the great sciatic nerve and accompanies the biceps for two inches, or till it is below the head of the iibula, where it pierces or penetrates the fibres of the peroneus longus, and in that muscle divides into its three terminal branches, viz. anterior tibial, musculo-cutaneous, and articular recurrent. Commonly, in the fibres of the tibialis anticus, a plexiform network will be found. This nerve gives off articular and cutaneous branches ; the articular nerves accompanying the external articular arteries to the joint.

It passes back and out with the musculo-spiral nerve in the musculo-spiral groove of the humerus between the outer and inner heads of the triceps and the bone to the outer side of the elbow, and pierces the external intermuscular septum with the musculo-spiral nerve. It will be subsequently traced in the dissection of the back of the arm between the brachialis anticus and supinator longus to anastomose with the recurrent radial.

The Nutrient Artery arises about the middle of the arm, near tlie in- ferior profunda, and passing down enters a large nutrient foramen near the insertion of the coraco-brachialis, and passes to supply the osseous and medullary substance of the humerus, its direction being towards the elbow.

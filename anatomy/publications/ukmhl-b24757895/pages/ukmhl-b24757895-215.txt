It winds from the inner to the outer side of the humerus with the superior profunda artery beneath the fibres of the triceps, and between its outer and inner heads and at the outer side of the arm and at its lower third it descends between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus to the front of the outer condyle, where it divides into a large branch, the 'posterior interosseous, which is mainly muscular, and a small branch, the radial, which is entirely cutaneous in its disti'ibution. The branches of this nerve are three muscular, thi-ee cutaneous, and the two terminal, viz., the radial and posterior interosseous. Long tendon of bicopj- Bracb. ant,.

The Muscular branches are external, posterior, and internal, and leave the nerve at the inner, outer, and back part of the arm. The inner is a slender ofFset, arising usually in common with the inner cutaneous branch of the nerve, and is close to the idnar, and supplies the inner and middle heads of the triceps, entering them at the lower third of the ai-m. The 'posterior branch is large, and is given off in the groove between the triceps and humerus. It su})plies the outer head of the triceps, and can be traced onwards to the anconeus, accompanying the posterior articidar branch from the superior profunda. The external iDranch supplies, usually, the outer jiart of the brachialis anticus, and also the supinator longus and extensor cai"pi radialis longior.

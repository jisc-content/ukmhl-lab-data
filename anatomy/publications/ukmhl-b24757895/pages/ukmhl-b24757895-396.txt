360 HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. the peritoneum and supra-peritoneal fatty tissue in the position from which they have been displaced, endeavour to force the intestine through the internal ring on the inner side of the femoral vein \intil his finger reaches the saphenous opening, he will get a correct idea of the course, covering, relations, and seats of stricture, of the two chief varieties of femoral hernia. There would be considerable difficulty in stretching the peritoneum if it had not j)reviously been dissected free from its attach- ments. The student must now understand that the formation of a heniia in the living is in the majority of cases a gradual jirocess. A pouch of peritoneum having been gradually distended either through congenital debility of the weak jDoints of the abdomen, or through repeated muscular efforts, such as coughing, straining, or through child-bearing, any extra effort may then force a fresh piece of intestine or omentum into the peri- Abnormal obturator arteries. Fig. 261.—The eight internal femoral ring, seen from within. The dotted vessels represent three abnormal positions that an unusual obturator artery may take. toneal pouch, and push the latter downwards along the canal, tlu-ough the saphenous opening and under the skin. This would form a complete femoral hernia; but should from any cause, i.e. insufficiency of the expulsive force, or an adhesion, or obstruction in the femoral canal, the hernia be retained in the canal, it cannot get out through the saphenous opening, and thus an incomplete femoral hernia is the result. This form cf hernia is usually small because of the resisting nature of the surround- ing parts, but the complete form may be large because it is free to expand in the loose areolar tissue beneath the skin. Course.—The direction of a femoral hernia is at first downwards, through the internal ring, and into the canal, and if it be a complete hernia it will change its direction at the saphenous opening and pass forwards and

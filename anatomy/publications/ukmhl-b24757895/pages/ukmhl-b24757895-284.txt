HUMAN MOnrHOLOGY. 248 phalanx above that into which it is inserted {ligamenta brevia). Each tendinous sheath has a synovial membrane which in the palm passes between the tendons. In the sheaths these synovial membranes form slender and long vascular folds between the tendons and the bones (vineula vasculosa^. The thinness of the sheaths opposite the joints permits of free flexion and extension. Dissection.—The student should now dissect out the digital vessels and nerves and lymphatics of one finger. These will be fully described fiu'ther on, but the accompanying figures will guide him in his dissection. He should then remove the palmar fascia carefully, so as to expose the superficial palmar arch, and the branches of the median and ulnar nerves, FXG. lliO.—ThK left SUPEKl'UCIAL PALMAR AUCIf. after having cleaned the sheath of one finger, and having become familiar with the arrangement of the flexor sheath in its entirety. Superficial Palmar Arch.—The ulnar artery passes obliquely outwards to the thumb muscles, where it sometimes joins the superficialis volse from the radial, and commonly inosculates with the radialis indicis branch of the same vessel, thus completing the palmar arch. The convexity of this arch is towards the iingers, and its position will be pretty accurately indicated by a line, drawn across the hand corresponding to the lower margin of the thumb when that is at right angles with the fingers. The deep palmar arch is about a finger's breadth nearer the wrist. Relations.—It is sitperjicial, being covered by the skin, palmar fascia,

550 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. The foot being on the ground it will steady the leg upon the foot, and will assist to lift the hinder part of the body weight, as in walking, &c. Kei've.—The musculo-cutaneous. Varieties.—There is often a tendinous slip for the third metatarsal, and sometimes others for the fourth, fifth, and even for the base of the first metatarsal. There is an occasional small head of origin from the fibula between it and the brevis. This is the ijeronem accessoriua, and its tendon usually joins that of the longus. The Peroneus Brevis is beneath the longus and is smaller and shorter than it. It arises from the anterior and posterior borders of the fibula, Scaphoid Middle cuneifm. Int.

Its fibres pass vertically downwards and end in a tendon which is placed in front of that of the longus; this passes, with the tendon of the peroneus longus, through the same groove beneath the external malleolus and under the external annular ligament, being enclosed in the same synovicil mem- brane. It then passes through a separate fibrous sheath on the outer side of the OS calcis above the tendon of the longus, and is inserted into the dorsal surface of the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe on its outer side. Relations.—In the leg it reaches a little in front of the longus which

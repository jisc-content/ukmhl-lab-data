417 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. inferior border is blended with the ghiteus minimus iind tensor fascite femoris, and its posterior edge is parallel with the pyriformis; the gluteal vessels and superior gluteal nerve being between. Its deep surface is in relation with the gluteus minimus and the gluteal vessels and superior gluteal nerve. Actions.—Acting from above it abducts and extends the thigh. Its anterior iibres rotate the femur in, and the posterior rotate it out. In walking it assists the adductors in moving the femur forwards. Acting from the fenuu- it supports the pelvis, and consequently the spine upon the head of the femur. Nerve.—It is supplied by the superior gluteal nerve. Varieties.—This muscle may also be bi-laminar. It may be joined Fig, 30;i.—Deep eiissection op eight gluteal region behind to the tendon of the pyriformis by an aponeurotic slip, or once in fifteen subjects a bursa (Loder's bursa) may sejijarate them. Dissection.—Detach the muscle near its origin and near its insertion, separate it from the minimus to which its anterior border is closely blended, and reflect it. The divisions of the gluteal artery and the superior gluteal nerve will now be exposed, and must be cleaned. The branches of the artery to this muscle will be cut in reflecting it. The Gluteal Artery is the largest branch of the internal iliac, and is apparently the continuation of the posterior division of that vessel. Only the jjart of it external to the pelvis is now dissected. It is a thick short I l unk, which leaves the pelvis above the upper border of the pyriformis, and at once divides into a superficial and deep branch. The superficial branch passes up beneath the gluteus maximus, giving numerous twigs E E

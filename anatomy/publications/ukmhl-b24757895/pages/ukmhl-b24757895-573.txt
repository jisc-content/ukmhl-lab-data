DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. side of the tarsxis. It overlaps the anterior tibial vessels and nerves in the upper part of the leg. Its inner border is in contact with the tibia, and its oiUer with the extensor longus digitorum above, and below with the extensor pollicis and anterior tibial vessels and nerve. Varieties.—Wood has described a small muscle, the tibio-fascialis anticus, which passes from the lower third of the anterior edge of the tibia over the tibialis anticus, to be inserted into the annular ligament and deep tibial fascia. It may exist as a tendinous slip from the tibialis anticus. in cases of talipes the tendon of thn tibialis anticus. is often found divided Fig. 415.—Muscles of the imoNT of the kight leg. mto two, one part being inserted in the usual way, the other going to the astragalus or first metatarsal bone. Sometimes the whole tendon has been inserted into the inner piece of the plantar fascia. Actions.—If the foot be free this muscle flexes the ankle, and in con- sequence of the oblique direction of its tendon it will raise the inner border of the foot and turn the big toe inwards. In the erect position, the foot being fixed, it will assist the other extensors in maintaining the leg bones in the perpendicular position, and will strengthen the ankle.

mssECTioy of the upper limb. 207 three inner luinbricales. At the clefts of the fingers they anastomose with the digital branches of the superficial arch. These vessels vary much in their size and distribution. The Beep Palmar Branch of the Ulnar Nerve accompanies the deep arch, and passes between the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti. At its origin it gives twigs to the muscles of the little finger, and as it crosses the hand it sends two branches to each interosseous space—one for the palmar, and the other for the dorsal interosseous muscle. The filaments to the second and third palnlcu- interossei send twigs to the two inner lumbricales. Near its terminatidn, between the thumb and index finger, it supplies the inner head of the flexor brevis and the adductor pollicis. It has similar relations to those of the deep arch. The Transverse Metadarpal Ligament is a nsLrrow fibrous band con- FiG. 183.—Deep palmar arch. Eight side. Tlie tendon of the flex. carp. rad. is cut. necting the heads of the four inner metacarpal bones. It passes trans- versely across their anterior surface, and blends with the ligaments of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints. Its anterior aspect has four grooves for the flexor tendons, and its posterior surface blends with the ligaments of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints, and beneath it the interossei pass to their insertion. Its anterior border is free, but its posterior is connected with the fascia covering the interossei muscles. Dissection.—This ligament must be divided and reflected from between the spaces, in order to see the mode of insertion of the interossei. The Palmar Interossei are three in number. They are smaller than the dorsal, and are situated on the palmar surface of the metacarpal bones, rather than beneath them. They arise from the whole length of the hollow lateral part of the,^ shaft of the metacarpal bone of the fingers, on which they act, and are inserted by tendons into the side of the base of

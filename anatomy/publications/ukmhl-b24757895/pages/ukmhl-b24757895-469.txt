433 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. respective superior and inferior articular arteries of the popliteal. Deep in the space will be found a nerve which occasionally arises from the great sciatic, iDut is more usually a brancli of the external popliteal. Underneath the nerve in the mid-line is the popliteal vein, and imme- diately beneath this, and closely adherent to it, is the popliteal artery. The superior and inferior articular branches of this vessel should be cleaned, and the accompanying veins traced into the popliteal vein. The muscular branches of these vessels should be traced out. On the upper Fig. 314.—Left popliteal space. A part of the sUort saphenous vein has been removed. The popliteal vein nnd arterj' are to the right of the internal popliteal nerve, the vein being in the middle. part of the artery will be found the branch from the obturator nerve to the knee joint; and above, at the sides, and in front of the vessel, will be noticed some small lymphatic glands. The space, after being cleaned, has a lozenge or diamond shape, but in the natural condition of the limb, the fascia lata binds the various struc- tures together, and the space is limited to the posterior aspect of the joint. Note that the space is widest opposite the femoral condyles, be- •-■ause there the muscles are most separated ; and observe that it is deepest 10 F

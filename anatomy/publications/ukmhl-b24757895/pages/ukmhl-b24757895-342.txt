HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 306 2. In the superficial fascia dissect out the subcutaneous veins and the cu- taneous nerves from the circumflex, musculo-spiral, and internal cutaneous. 3. Eeflect the aponeurosis of the triceps, making out the external and internal intermuscular septa and the structures which pierce them. 4. Make out the three heads of origin of the triceps. 5. Trace out the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery and their branches and accompanying veins; also the ulnar nerve. BACK OF THE ELBOW. 1. Dissect out the superficial veins and nerves, the latter coming from the internal cutaneous, the musculo-cutaneous, and musculo-spiral, and observe the subcutaneous bursa over the triceps insertion. 2. Observe the continuation of the deep fascia of the arm with that of the forearm, and note the insertion of the triceps and the close relation between it and the deep fascia. 3. Eeflect the triceps, make out the attachments of the anconeus, observe the posterior articular branches of the superior profunda, the posterior branches of the inferior profunda and the anastomotica magna, and dissect out their anastomoses with the posterior ulnar and interosseous recurrents. 4. Define the posterior ligament of the elbow joint. FRONT OF THE FOREARM. 1. Make an incision from the bend of the elbow to just below the wrist, and transverse ones on the inner and outer sides joining this. 2. In the superficial fascia dissect out the cutaneous, radial, and ulnar veins on the outer and inner sides, and the cutaneous branches of the ex- ternal and internal cutaneous and musculo-spiral nerves ; then reflect it. 3. After observing the deep fascia or muscular aponeurosis, reflect it by a similar incision, noting the origins of the muscles from it at the upper part and the sheaths it forms for them. 4. Observe the long supinator and extensors on the outer side going to the back of the forearm and the flexors and pronators in front. 5. Dissect out the radial and ulnar arteries and branches, and the ac- companying veins and nerves. 6. Carefully reflect the tendon of the flexor sublimis, and dissect out the deeper layer of muscles, which are, 7. The flexor profundus, flexor longus pollicis, and pronator quadratus. 8. Make out the common and anterior interosseous branches of the ulnar and the accompanying veins and anterior interosseous nerve from the median; also define the anastomoses between the anterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar. 9. Observe thÂ§ attachment of the anterior annular ligament, and note the tendons of the vessels and nerves which pass below and above it. 10. Make out the attachments of the interosseous membrane and the structures which are in relation with and pierce it. 11. Eeflect the origins of the flexors and pronators, and make out the attachments and relations of the anterior ligament of the elbow and front of the orbicular ligament.

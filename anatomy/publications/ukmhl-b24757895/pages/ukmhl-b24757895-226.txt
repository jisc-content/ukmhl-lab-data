The anterior one corresponds to the radio-caii)al articulation, and the posterior to the lower radio-ulnar joint. Transverse lines are seen on both aspects of the digits and thumb. Those on the palmar aspects of the fingers guide to their articulations ; the first inter- phalangeal furrow being slightly in front of the larger or proximal trans- verse groove, and the joint between the last two phalanges is about a line in front of the main groove. There are also two or three transverse grooves near the bases of the fingers, on their palmar aspects on a level with the webs. If the thumb be placed at right angles to the extended fingers, and a line drawn across the palm level with its lower border, it will very nearly Fk;. 112.—Supeeficial lymphatics of back of mght fobearm.

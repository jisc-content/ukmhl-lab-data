The inner nerve crosses from the outer to the inner side of its corresponding artery beneath it (in the erect position). The Internal Plantar Nerve, the larger, passes foi'wards between the abductor pollicis and flexor digitorum to the bases of the inner metatarsal bones, where it divides into four digital branches. It gives muscular twigs to the abductor pollicis and flexor brevis digitorum, and some cuta- neous ones which pierce the plantar fascia and supply the skin of the inner side of the sole, also articular filaments to the inner tarsal and metatarsal joints, and ends in four digital branches, which pierce the plantar fascia in the clefts between the toes, passing with the digital arteries under the superficial transverse ligament to be distributed thus: the first is near the inner border of the great toe, and is undivided ; before it reaches the toe it supplies the flexor brevis pollicis. The outer three nerves are bifur- FiG. 371.â€”Bight plantar nerves. SurERWCiAL dissection. cated at the interdigital clefts. The second digital supplies the con- tiguous sides of the gi'eat and second toes, giving a branch to the first himbricalis. The third digital supplies the adjacent sides of the second and third toes, and the second lumbricalis. The fourth digital supplies the contiguous sides of the third and fourth toes, and communicates with the external plantar nerve. On the toes these nerves run with their cor- responding digital arteries, and supply the interphalangeal joints, the skin, and the cutis beneath the nail. The External Plantar Nerve, the smaller, is destined mainly for the deep muscles of the sole. It resembles the ulnar in the hand, the internal plantar resembling the median. It gives digital branches to both sides of the little toe and the outer side of the fourth toe. It accompanies the external plantar artery, lying between the flexor accessorius and flexor

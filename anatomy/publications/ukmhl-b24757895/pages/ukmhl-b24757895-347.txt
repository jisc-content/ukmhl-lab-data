311 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. to Gnibei", the styloid process of the third metnciupal which has bpcome separated. The intermedium has two ossific centres and the two facets usually present at its distal end frequently coalesce. Metacarpal Bones.—Occasionally the styloid process of the third meta- carpal is connected with the os carpi intermedium by a joint. Sesamoid Bones.—The sesamoid bones of the thumb are absent in about 13 per cent, of cases. The sesamoid of the first joint of the second finger is sometimes on the ulnar and sometimes on the radial side, and is Fig. 227.—The supra-condylotd process. From fore-limb op cat Half natural size.

The half-grown bony arch in the kitten correspoi.ds e.Kactly to the full-length bony process in mnn. absent in about 31 per cent, of subjects. The sesamoid of the fifth finger lies on its ulnar side, and is absent in about 19 per cent, of cases. The second finger possesses a sesamoid bone or fibro-cartilage in about 42 per cent, of cases, and the little finger in about 70 per cent.; and they were symmetrical on the right and left sides in 86 per cent, of subjects. Very rarely, a sesamoid bone is found on the first joint of the fourth finger. (Consult the writings of Cxrnber, W. Krause, Hosenburg, Grillette, Barkow, and Aeby for further particulars upon this subject.)

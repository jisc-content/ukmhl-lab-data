It is distributed mainly to the genital organs and lower end of the rectum, and furnishes almost all the vessels to the structures in both perinteal spaces. Only the posterior part of the artery is now to be dissected. It leaves the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, taking a curved course, and accom- panied by the nerve, it re-enters the pelvis through the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen just below the ischial spine, behind which it i^asses ; it then runs forward on the inner side of the tuber ischii external to the ischio-rectal fossa but internal to (i.e. nearer the mid-line) the obtm-ator intemus, Obt.

The Inferior or External hcemorrhoidal, two or three in number, cross the fossa through the fat to the lower end of the rectum, and to the external sphincter, levator ani, and skin around the anus and over the anterior part of the perinseum. It anastomoses on the rectum with the superior hgemorrhoidal from the inferior mesenteric, and middle hgemorrhoidal from the anterior trunk of the internal iliac, and joins the supei-ficial perinatal branch in front. Some muscular twigs to the anterior part of the levator ani may be seen at the front of the fossa. A few twigs of the sciatic artery to the inner surface of the gluteus maximus, and to the skin and fat in its neighbom-hood, may be seen at the back of the space,

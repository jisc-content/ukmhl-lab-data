DISSJECTIOJV OF TJUS UPPER LIMB. 207 ment, and from the middle tliird of the posterior surface of the radial shaft. This attachment is lower than that from the ulna. Its tendon passes obliquely down and out with that of the extensor primi internodii, in a groove on the outer side of the styloid process of the radius, and is inserted nuiinly into the outer side of the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, and by ii- slip into the outer side and dorsum of the trapezium.

Between its upper border and the supinator brevis is the posterior interosseous artery, and its loiver border is in relation with the extensor jn-irni internodii.

HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 642 pass on to be inseried into the base of the third phaUinx on its dorsal aspect. Relations. Anteriorly with the deep fascia and annular ligament, posteriorly with the external tuberosity of the tibia, anterior surfaces of the fibula, interosseous membrane, ankle joint, and extensor brevis digi- torum. Internally with the tibialis anticus, extensor proprius pollicis, and anterior tibial vessels and nerve. Externally with the peroneus Fibrous bands to flrsit plialanx luner tend, ext. brev.

The anterior tibial nerve passes obliquely under its upper part. Varieties.—The tendons of this muscle vary considerably in their position, number, and method of insertion. External slips are commonly given off from one or more of the tendons to the corresponding metatarsal bones or to the extensor brevis or one of the interossei. The tendons to the second and fifth toes may also be found doubled, and in one instance there was a special belly for the fourth toe which gave off four tendons passing to the fourth metatarsal and three phalanges. It may send a tendinous expansion to the extensor pollicis. Actions.—It extends the joints of the four lesser toes from tip to root, and continuing its action, flexes the ankle joint. Acting from helow, it will steady the tibia and fibula on the astragalus, and if the tibia be in-

DISSECTION OF THE UFPEE LIMB. 251 to the thumb and index finger. The internal branch supplies the con- tiguous sides of the index and middle, and of the middle and ring fingers. The Branch of the Thumb Muscles is short and divides to supply the abductor, opponens, and outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis, the other thumb muscles being supplied by the ulnar nerve. The Digital Branches are five. The first and second are distributed to the outer and inner borders of the thumb, the external branch joining t he radial nerve. The third digital passes along the radial side of the index finger and supplies the first lumbricalis muscle. The fourth Ant. intoLs. n. Uluai- n. Fig. 163.â€”Nerves of eight hand. Deep dissection. The pronator qnadratus is out to show the ant. IntoSs. nerve. bifurcates at the web to supply the adjacent sides of the index and middle fingers and the second lumbricalis. The fifth supplies the contiguous sides of the middle and ring fingers and joins a branch of the ulnar nerve. On the Fingers the nerves are superficial to the arteries and extend to the last phalanx, where they divide into a palmar and dorsal branch. The former supplies the ball of the finger, and the latter the nail pulp. Each nerve near the base of the first phalanx gives off a dorsal branch which joins the dorsal digital nerve, and runs along the side of the dorsum of the finger ending in the skin over the last phalanx.

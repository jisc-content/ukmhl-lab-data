DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. 125 Varieties. This muscle is subject to much variatiou as to its extent and attachment, and may vary on the opposite sides of the same body. The Internal Mammary Artery is a branch of the first part of the sub- clavian, and is given off from its under sm-face opposite the thyroid axis. It passes into the thorax behind the clavicle, and rests on the costal carti- lages near the sternum, and between the sixth and seventh cartilages it divides into the musculo-phrenic and superior epigastric. It passes beneath the seventh rib and enters the sheath of the rectus, and is accompanied by two veins, which unite by a single trunk at the upper part of the thorax, and by some lymphatic vessels and glands. Relations.—At its origin it is concealed by the internal jugular and subclavian veins, and crossed by the phrenic nerve. At the upper part of Fig. 57.—The muscles attached to the sternum and upper ribs seen from behind. the thorax it is between the costal cartilages and internal intercostals in front, and the pleura and transversalis sterni behind. This latter muscle separates it from the pleura at the lower part of the thorax. Branches.—The comes nervi phrenici, or superior phrenic, is a long slender branch given off from the internal mammary as the artery enters the thorax. It accompanies the phrenic nerve between the pleura and pericardium, to which it is distributed, and joins the phrenic branches of the abdominal aorta and the musculo-phrenic. The Mediastirud lirjinchcs nro smnll vessels which supply tlio peri- cardium, the remains of the thymus gland, the transversalis sterni, and the cellular tissues in the anterior mediastinum. The Pericardiac liranches sii])ply tlie u})per part of the pericardium, the lower part of which is nourished by the musculo-phrenic.

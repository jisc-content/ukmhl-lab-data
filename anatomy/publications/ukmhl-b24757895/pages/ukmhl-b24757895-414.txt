HUMAN MORPIIOLOGY. 378 is the long saphenous nerve which, although in the canal, is not within the sheath of the vessels. Branches.—A few unnamed rausculai- twigs and the anastomotica magna arise from this part of the artery. The Anastomotica Magna is given off from the femoral in Hunter's canal just before it passes through the tendinous opening in the adductor muscle. It at once divides into a superficial and deep branch. The Superficial Branch pierces the anterior wall of the canal and accom- panies the saphenous vein to the lower border of the sartorius, and perfo- rating the fascia lata, ends in the sbin. The Deep Branch runs in the fibres of the vastus internus, lying in front of the tendon of the adductor magnus, to the inner side of the knee, where it anastomoses with the superior internal articular branch of the popliteal, and the recurrent articular branch of the anterior tibial. It gives off a branch which crosses outwards in the substance of the vastus \ Fig. 275.—Dissection or left Hunter's canal. internus above the articular surface of the femur and anastomoses with an offset of the superior external articular artery, forming an arch, from which branches are distributed to the front of the knee. The Muscular Branches come chiefly from the outer side of the artery and supply the vastus internus, adductor longus, and sartorius. The Femoral Vein in this part of its course is external to the artery, and has similar relations to it, receiving branches corresponding to those of the artery. Variety.—This vein may pierce the adductor magnus above the usual jjlace, and joining the deep femoral vein approach the femoral artery at the groin. It may be doubled in its whole length, or only in a small part of its course. In rare cases the two veins which are united to form the femoral are joined by three or four transverse branches in front of the femoral artery, and in other instances there are three or foiu' largish

247 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. fibrous sheath which is partly formed by the processes of the palmar fascia. Opposite the middle of the first and second phalanges the sheaths consist of strong tendinous transverse bands {ligamenta vaginalia), which are Fig. 157.—Digital lymphatics and theib plexuses, showing the ulnar side of a finger and the anastomes across the dorsum. attached to the lateral margins of the palmar surfaces of the phalanges. Opposite the inter-phalangeal joints the sheath is thin, but is strengthened Palmar coll. Branches to finger pulp. Fig. 158;—Collateral digital nerves op finger. by oblique decussating fibres. Some slender loose tendinous bands pass from the floor of the sheath to the deep surfaces of both, tendons (vincula FiG. 159.—Lymphatics of radial side op a right finger.

Behind each tendon, near its insertion, a short membranous structure fixes its con-esponding tendon to the front of the

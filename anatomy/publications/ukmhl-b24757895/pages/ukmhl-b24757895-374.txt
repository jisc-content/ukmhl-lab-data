When it reaches quite to the knee, it joins the internal saphenous and helps to form the plexus patellae or prse-patellae, it also joins the outer branch of the middle cutaneous to form the plexus patellae. The Posterior Branch pierces the fascia about an inch below Poupart's ligament and divides into two or three filaments, which turn back and out to supply the skin from the upper border of the ilium to near the Ext. oblique Ext. cnt.

Its branches are crossed by the cutaneous branches from the last dorsal nerve. The Internal Cutaneous Nerve, from the anterior crural crosses obliquely inwards over the upper part of the femoral artery and divides either m front or to the inner side of it, into an anterior and internal branch which pierce the deep fascia at different levels. It supplies all the mside of the thigh and the upper part of the leg. Before dividing, it gives off two or three twigs which pierce the fascia lata to supply the skin

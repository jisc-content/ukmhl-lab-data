INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS. :35 The Thorax has the form of a quadrangular iiyramid whose base is above and is compressed from before backwards. This shape is just the opposite to tliat of the bony framework of the thorax, and is due to the presence of the scapulte and of the soft i^arts. The right side of the chest is usually larger than the left, and its axis is not ordinarily in a right line with that of the abdomen; i.e. a line passing from the inter-clavicular fossa to the middle of the xiphoid appendix makes, with another line Fig. 9.â€”Right-side view of tub spinal column, ribs, and pelvis. passing from this appendix to the pubic symphysis, an obtuse angle open to the right. Independently of the size of the mamm^ the sexual dif- ferences are well marked in women, and the thoracic diameters, but chiefly the transverse diameters, are less than in men. The maximum antero- posterior diameter, instead of corresponding to the base of the xii)hoid appendix, is at the middle of the sternum, which presents an anterior cur- vature. ^ It has, besides, a more vertical position than in man, and thus the feminine chest possesses a more rounded form. The thorax is divisible into an anterior, posterior, and two lateral regions, wliich will be described ^v-ith the dissection of this part; and it contains the heart, aorta, and other D 1!

457 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. Synovial Membrane.—The synovial membrane of this joint is extensive, and like all serous membranes is a closed sac. It lines the capsular ligament and invests the others. If we commence at the margin of the acetabulum it will be seen to be reflected on the inner surfaces of the cap- sular, and reflected along the neck and over the head of the femur, along the ligamentum teres to the bottom of the acetabulum, and then along the inner side of the cotyloid ligament, over its outer side to the margin of the acetabulum again. Movements of the Joint.—These are : flexion, extension, abduction. Fig. 3:39.—Vertical xKANsvEiisJi sf.ction tiieough right hip joint. A. lutonml Iliac foasa cut. adduction, circumduction, and rotation. Flexion is much greater than extension, and is only limited by the contact of the thigh and abdominal wall. The posterior part of the capsule and the ilio-trochanteric band are rendered tight. The flexors are the psoas and iliacus, assisted by the Scartorius and rectus. In extension the anterior part of the capsule, especially it? ilio- and pubo-femoral bands, are made tense. Extension is mainly produced by the hamstring muscles, aided by the gluteus maximus. Buring these to and fro movements, the femoral head I'otates round a line which is on a plane with the axis of the head and neck, and the more

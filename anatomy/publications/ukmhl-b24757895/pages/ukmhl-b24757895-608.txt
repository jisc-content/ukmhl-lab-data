HUMAN MOltrilOLOOY. 573 and second row of bones. At its attachment to the os calcis it is external to the band for the scaphoid bone. The long calcaneo-cuboid is the strongest of the ligaments of this joint, and is the more superficial of the two plantar ones. It is the longest of all the tarsal ligaments, and is called ligamentum longum jplantcc. It is attached to the under surface of the os calcis very near the anterior and posterior tubercles, and is inserted in the ridge on the under surface of the cuboid, the innermost fibres passing over the tendon of the peroneus longus, aiding in the formation of its sheath, and its more superficial fibres pass to be inserted to the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. Astragalus Fig. 151.â€”Plantar ligaments, posterior part of left foot. This ligament converts a groove on the under surf;ice of the cuboid into a canal for the passage of the tendon of the peroneus longus. The short calcaneo-cuboid ligament is the deeper plantar ligament, and will be seen after division of the superficial part, from which it is separated by a little adipose connective tissue. It is very broad, about an inch long, and passes from the tubercle, and the depression in front of it, to the fore part of the under surface of the os calcis and to the under

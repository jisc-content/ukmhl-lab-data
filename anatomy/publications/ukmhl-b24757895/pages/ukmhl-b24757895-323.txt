287 DISS-ECTION OF THE UFFJEli LIMB. ment checks 'pronation^ and the anterior limits supination. The inter- osseous ligament is tense in supination, but loose in pronation. In these motions the radius alone is movable,' and revolves round a vertical line which is inside its shaft, and which extends up through the head and neck of the bone, and down through the centre of a circle, of which the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna is a segment. If this line be prolonged upwards it will pass through the centre of the humeral head. T2 1. Post. mil. cixi'i). 2. Ii.t. lat. 3. E.\t. lat. 4. Dorsal carp. 5. Deep carpal. G. Magno-unciform. 7.

The hand follows the radius in its movements, being almost completely shut off from articulating with the ulna by the fibro-cartilage. Pronation is produced by the pronators teres and quadratus, and partly by the flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis longior. Supination is effected by the biceps and supinator brevis. Surgical Applications.—These movements cease in fractm-e of either ' Tlii.s is the ordinary view, but in fact, tlie lower end of the ulna rotate.son the radiusin these movements, and I have a paper in preparation which I think will demonstrate this fact.

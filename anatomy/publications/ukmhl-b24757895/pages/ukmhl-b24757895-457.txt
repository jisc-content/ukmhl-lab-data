421 niSSIiVTlOX OF T]IE LOWER LIMB. Dissection.—Keflect this muscle by cutting through it near its origin. Seek the long head of the rectus beneath it and close above the hip joint. On throwing down the muscle towards its insertion its intimate connec- tion with the hip capsule will be evident. The deep vessels to the joint will also be noticed. The long outer or reflected head of the rectus will now be seen to reach almost horizontally outwards to a groove above the margin of the acetabulum. It should be traced forward to its junc- tion with the short head of the rectuf-', and its connection with the capsule of the hip must be made evident. The Pyriformis is triangular and Hat, and runs parallel with the pos- terior margin of the gluteus medius. It arises within the pelvis from the Fig. 307.—Tuk kight uLurjiAL artekx and branches. front of the sacrum by three fleshy digitations between the first, second, and third anterior sacral foramina. A few fibres come from the inner margin of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and from the anterior surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. It leaves the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and is inserted by a rounded tendon into the u])pei- border of the great trochanter between the two lesser glutei, being often blended with the tendon of the obturator internus.

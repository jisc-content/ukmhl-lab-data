DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 419 chanter, supplying tlie glutei and tensor fascia3 latae, and inosculates with the ascending branches of the external circumflex artery. Some branches pierce the gluteus medius to nourish the hip joint. The gluteal vein enters the pelvis above the pyriforniis and ends in the internal iliac vein. It is accompanied by some lymphatic vessels which debouch into the lumbar glands. The Superior Gluteal Nerve is given off from the back part of the lumbo-sacral cord, and leaves the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, above the pyriforinis in company with the gluteal artery, and divides into a superior and inferior branch. The former runs along the Fig. 305.â€”Deep muscles of the eight buttock. line of the gluteus medius and minimus, supplying both these muscles. The latter crosses the lesser glutei, supplying them, and ends in the under surface of the tensor fasciae femoris, passing nearly to its lower end. The Gluteus Minimus is the smallest of the glutei, is triangular, and is placed immediately beneath the medius. It passes from the back of the ilium over the posterior and upper surface of the hip joint to the great trochanter. It arises from the surface between the middle and inferior curved lines on the dorsum ilii, and from the upper margin of the great sacro-sciatic foramen. The fibres pass to the deep surface of an apo- U B 2

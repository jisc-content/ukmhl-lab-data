These insertions will be more cleai*ly made out when the knee joint is dissected. This muscle is made up of short fibres which extend obliquely between two aponeurotic expansions which pass down and up on the oppo- site sides of it, from its upper and lower tendons, for three quarters of its length. The expansion from the upper tendon covers the upper part of its anterior aspect, and that from the lower tendon invests the lower part Origin of semimemb. Origin of biceps and semiteud.

The tendon of this muscle, the semitendinosus, gracilis, and sartorius, form the inner and upper hamstring limit of the popliteal space. Relations.—On its jjosterior surface the semitendinosus is placed in a hollow in the upper tendon, and the biceps and fascia lata are also in rela- tion to this surface ; by the anterior surfiice it is in relation with the adductor magnus, the popliteal vessels at their upper part, and the inner head of the gastrocnemius, from which its tendon is separated by a large

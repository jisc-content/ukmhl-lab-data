The Pectoralis Major is a triangular broad, thick muscle placed at the upper and anterior part of the thorax, and in front of the axilla. Its base is at the chest, and its apex at the humerus. It arises by aponeurotic fibres, 1. Int. mammary. 2. Intercostal arteries. 3. Perforating. 4. Ext. branch of mammary. 6. Int. ,, „ C. Epigastric. 7. Anast. witli int. mammary. 8. Long thoracic. !).

The fibres rotate and converge to its insertion. The clavicular fibres pass down and out, and are generally separated from the rest by a small interval; those from the lower end of the sternum and lower costal cartilages pass up and out beneath the former, whilst tlie middle fibres pass horizontally out. These three sets of fibres overlap each other, the upper overriding the middle, and the middle the lower. The fibres of the lower portion are folded back U[)on themselves, so that those fibres which are lowest in front are highest at their insertion. These various filjres end in a fiat tendon about two inches broad, which is inserted into the anterior bicipital ridge of the II 2

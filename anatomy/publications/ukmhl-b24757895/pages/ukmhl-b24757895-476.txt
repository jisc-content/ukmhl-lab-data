The soleus has been removed from the posterior aspect of the fibula and the gastrocnemius removed. The Inferior Internal Articular Branch will be found ascending along the anterior border of the internal lateral ligament, and after anastomos- ing with the external articular and superior internal articular, is distri- buted to the head of the tibia and the knee ioint. The Azygos Articular is given off from the front of the pophteal

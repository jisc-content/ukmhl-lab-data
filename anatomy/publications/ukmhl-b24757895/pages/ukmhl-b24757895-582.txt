540 HUMAN MORniOLOGY. Relations op the Anterior Tibial Artery. In front.—Skin, sup. and deep fa.scife and anterior annular ligament tibialis anticus in upper part of leg, extensor lougus digitorum, extensor proprius pollicis, and anterior tibial nerve. Imide.—Tibialis anticus, and the extensor proprius pollicis crosses it at its lower part. Outside.—The anterior tibial nerve, extensor longus digitorum, and extensor proprius pollicis. Behind.—The iuterosseous membrane, tibia, and anterior ligament of the ankle joint. Branches.—These are the recurrent tibial, cutaneous, muscular, in- ternal and external malleolar, and articular to the ankle. The Recurrent Tibial is given off directly the vessel passes through the interosseous membrane. It ascends in the tibialis anticus to the front and sides of the knee joint, anastomosing with the inferior articular branches of the popliteal. Ant. peron.- Anast". with ext. niaU'. Tarsal Dorsal intoss. Fig. 426. Ant. tib. lut. mall'. Dorsalis pedis Int. brauches Metatarsal Comte. to plantar arch Fii-st dorsal intoss. Digital -Arteries on dorsum op right foot and their anastomoses. The tendons of the tib. ant. and per. tert. are cut short at their insertion. The Muscular Branches are numerous, and supply the muscles of the front of the leg. Some pierce the deep fascia and furnish the cutaneous arteries, others pass through the interosseous membrane and inosculate with branches of the posterior tibial and peroneal. The Cutaneous Branches are given off at intervals, either from the

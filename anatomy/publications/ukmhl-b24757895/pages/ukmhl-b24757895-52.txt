IG IITJMAN MORPHOLOGY. anatomist and physiologist. Among his principal published works maybe mentioned his ' Treatise on the Natural History of the Human Teeth,' 2 vols. 1771-78; also his ' Treatise on the Venereal Disease,' 1786. Samuel Thomas von Soemmering (1755-1830) published in the year 1794 his excellent work, ' De Corporis Humani Fabrica,' Francf., 6 vols., originally published in Grerman. A new edition of this important text- book, in eight volaraes, with large additions by Bischoff, Henle, Theile, Valentin, and other eminent Grerman anatomists and physiologists, was published between 1841 and 1844. This great work brings our anatomical knowledge down to 1844. The seventh volume, it may be mentioned, contains the history of the development in mammalia, including man. Johann Christian Reil (1759-1813) greatly enriched the anatomy of the brain and the nerves by his articles in his ' Archiv fiir Physiologie' (Reil's Island). France was not behind Grermany in the cultivation of the science of anatomy. The ' Anatomie Grenerale appliquee a- la Physiologie,' Paris, 1801, is perhaps the ablest work on that subject which France has pro- duced in that period. Franpois Xavier Bichat (1771-1802), the author of this truly great work, was, unfortunately for science, prematurely cut off in his thirty-first year by typhoid fever. With Bichat we luay associate George Otivier (1769-1832), the founder of palseontology, and the greatest zoologist of his time. F. Joseph Gall (1757-1828), the founder of the systern of phrenology, and J. Jasper Spurzheim (1776-1832), his associate in the prosecution of his researches, have both, whether their system be received or not, by their contributions to the structui'e of the brain and the cerebral nerves, as well as by their collections of psychological ftrcts, conferred considerable benefits on anatomical science (' Anatomie et Physiologie du Systeirte nerveux en General et du Cerveau en Particulier,' 4 vols., Paris, 1809- 1819). Regnier de Graaf, born in Holland, 1641 (died, 1673), a pupil of Frances de le Boe (Sylvius), published in 1663 a treatise, ' Disputatio Medica de Natura etUsuSucci Pancreatici,' Lugd. Bat., 1673; and in 1672 his work, 'De Mulierum Organis,' &c., Lugd. Bat. These works gained him a great reputation as an anatomist (Graafian vesicles or follicles). Other works on human anatomy were published in England at the commencement of the present century by the Monro's, John and Charles Bell, Gordon, all of Edinburgh University. Jones' Quain's excellent text- book, the eigth edition of which, edited by Sharpey and Thomson, still holds its own. Comparative anatomy in Great Britain owes much to the labours' of Eichard Owen, A. Carlyle, Goodsir, Busk, W. H. Flower, Huxley and other writers of the present day; nor is it possible, limited as our space is, to name all the authors who have contributed to this branch of knowledge. After the invention of the compound achromatic microscope by Frauen- hofer, the minute structural anatomy of the tissues and organs was almost created anew. Johannes Miiller in Berlin published in 1830 a paper on the minute structure of the glands ; Ehrenberg in Berlin, I^ui'kinje, Prochaska and Valentin were all engaged in microscopic researches. Kieman gave the first accurate account of the minute anatomy of the liver. M. J. Schleiden published in 1838 an interesting treatise on the

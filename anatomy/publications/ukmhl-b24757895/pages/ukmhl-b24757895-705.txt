609 DISSJECTION OF THE FElilNJEVM. inner mai'gin of the pubic arch nearly to tlie pubes, where it perforates the su[)erficial layer of the deep perinoeal fascia or triangular ligament, and divides into its two terminal branches, viz. the dorsal artery of the penis, and the artery of the corpus cavernosum. Relations.—In this part of its course it is between the two layers of the deep perinaeal fascia, close to the pubic arch, and usually beneath the deep transverse muscle. The membranous urethra and its branch to the bulb are on its inner side, and the nerve is deeper than the vessel. It is accompanied by vense comites, and gives off the following branches; viz. Fig. 490.—Deeper dissection of male perinj^;um. the artery of the bulb, musmlar, the artery of the corpus cavernosicm, and the dorsal artery of the penis. The Artery of the Bulb is a large but short vessel, which is given off near the base of the triangular ligament, and passes between the two layers of the deep perinatal fascia obliquely inwards, about half an inch from its base to the back of the bulb, which it pierces, and supplies it and the corpus spongiosum. A small branch to Cowper's gland is given off by it near the urethra. Varieties.-—It is sometimes small, occasionally double, and may be altogether absent. It may arise earlier, i.e. further back in the perinaaum

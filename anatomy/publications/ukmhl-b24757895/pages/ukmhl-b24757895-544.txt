508 HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. internal plantar nerve, which is the larger, supplies the three inner toes and the inner side of the fourth. The Dorsalis Pedis artery, the continuation of the anterior tibial, enters the sole at the back of the first metatarsal interosseous space, where it divides into two branches which have been dissected with the sole of the foot. It inosculates by its communicating branch with the plantar arch. It resembles the radial artery in the hand, being distributed to one digit and a half, viz. by a large digital to both sides of the great toe and half the next. The digital branch, or dorsalis pollicis or hallucis, passes along the outer border of the first metatarsal bone to the first interosseous space, and divides into two branches, of which one passes inwards beneath the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis to the inner border of the great Fig. 386.—Dissection to show the plantar ikterossei and insertion of THE DEEP tendons. toe ; another divides at the web between the great and next toe, to supply the adjoining sides of the toes. These vessels are of similar ai-range- ment to the other digital branches along the toes, and the second digital inosculates at the end of the toe with the branch from the anterior tibial and that from the plantar arch. Nerves.—External Plantar Nerve.—The deep branch of this nerve accompanies the deep part of the external plantar artery, and terminates internally to the adductor pollicis. It suppUes all the interossei, except the fourth, the two outer lumbricales, the adductor pollicis, and the trans- versalis pedis. It sends some articular filaments to the tarsal articulations, and closely resembles in its distribution the ulna nerve in the hand. Dissection.—Eemove the transversalis pedis, and clean the ligament passing across the heads of the metatarsal bones.

Some strongish transverse fibres (the superficial transverse ligament) connect these processes at their point of separation, and beneath them pass the digital vessels and nerves and the tendons of the lumbricales. Each process of the fascia sends a few superficial longitudinal fibres to the skin between the finger clefts. The siijperjlcial surface of this fascia is closely Fig. 153.â€”Superficial palmar region, left hand. The palmar fascia is supposed transparent, allowing the arch dotted. The flexor sheaths are preserved. united to the skin by many fibrous bands, and gives origin by its inner margin to the palmaris brevis. Its deep surface covers the superficial palmar arch, the tendons of the flexors with their synovial sheaths, and the branches of the median and ulnar nerves. On each side this central piece gives off a vertical septum which is continuous with the aponeurosis

HUMAN M0RVH0L0G7. 258 is often connected at its origin with a slip from the extensor ossis metacarpi tendon. Action.—It draws the metacarpal bone of the thumb outwards, i.e. from the other digits; and this being done it may aid the flexor brevis pollicis in flexing the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation. Nerve.—The median. Varieties.—It is frequently divided into an outer and inner part which Soemmerring considered as normal. It sometimes has accessory slips from the opponens pollicis, or from the styloid process of the radius. Dissection.—Divide the abductor about its middle and reflect it. A slight cellular interval will be found between the inner border of this muscle and the flexor bre\ds, which will be a guide to the point of sepa- -Transv. band Fig. 172.—Muscles and tendons of the right palm.

It arises from the palmar surface of the trapezium, from its ridge, and from the annular ligament, and passes down and out to be inserted into the whole length of the metacarpal bone of the thumb at its radial border, and partly into its anterior aspect. Relations.—Sn'perficially, with the abductor pollicis ; cZeep^?/, with the trapezio-metacarpal joint; inside, with the flexor brevis pollicis; and out- side is the abductor pollicis. Action.—It draws the metacarpal bone of the thumb towards the palm,

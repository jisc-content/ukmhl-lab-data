DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LI MIL THE INNER SIDE OF THE THIGH. In this dissection the student will become familiar with the three ad- ductor muscles, with the gracilis, obturator extemus, and the insertion of the psoas and iliacus. He will also dissect out the profunda artery and vein and their branches, also those of the obturator artery and nerve, the latter being found deeply situated amongst the adductors. Dissection.—The skin, liitty tissue, and fascia must be removed from the muscles, and the adductors magnus and brevis should be separated Fig. 283.—Muscles of the inside of the right thigh. from each other, being careful of the branches of the obturator nerve which are beneath them, and especially of an offset which lies beneath the adductor magnus and goes to join the femoral plexus. The branches of the profunda artery and vein must also be cleaned. The Gracilis is the most superficial muscle of the internal femoral region, and is a long slender riband-like structure, passing from the pelvis to the tibia. It is broad above and nan-ow below, and arises by a thin flattened tendon between two and three inches broad from the inner mar- gin of the rami of the pubes and ischium along the lower half of the sym-

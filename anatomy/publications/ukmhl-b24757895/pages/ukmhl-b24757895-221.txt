DISSECTION OF THE TIPPER LIMB. 185 Xsidi-ao'omial 6zt7'sa. described as lying beneath the deltoid, separating it from the capsule, and passing between the contiguous Rurfaccs of the coracoid and acroniial processes and coraco-acroinial ligament, pei-inits free motion of the shoulder without friction against the parts just naen- tioned. The Arteries supplying this joint come from the supra-scapulnr, acromio- thoracic, and anterior and posterior eircumllex. The Nerves come from the circumflex and supra-scapular.

The axillary artery is elvlng off the superior tlioraeic, and has the vein to its inner, nnil cords of brachial ple.-^us to its outer, side. The deltoid is cnt anil i)nlled outwards. The dark spaee hetwoen the humerus, deltoid, and cirouiuflex vessels represents the aub-deltoid burea. Artictdar Surfaces.—The joint surfaces of the humerus and glenoid cavity are covered by cartilage. That on the humeral head is thicker at the centre than at the circumference, and the opposite condition prevails in the glenoid cavity. The humeral head is two or three times larger than tlie glenoid cavity, and forms nearly linlf a sphere, and is joined to its shaft at a slight angle, which nllows of considerahh' circumductory and rotatory motion. The Glenoid Fossa of the scapula is oval with its large end downwards,

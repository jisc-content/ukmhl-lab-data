The Supra-Scapular' Nerve comes from the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves, and is a branch of the brachial plexus given oft' above the clavicle. It passes obliquely outwai-ds beneath the trapezius, enters the siipra-spinous fossa beneath the transverse ligament, giving two branches Fig. 73.—Amastomosks of the scapular arteries. Anterior view. to the supra-spinatus and filaments to the shoulder joint. It then passes beneath the supra-spinatus, curving round the outer border of the scapular spine beneath a fibrous band (the spino-glenoid ligament) to the infra- spinous fossa, where it gives two branches to the ijifra-spinatus and some filaments to the shoulder joint and scapula. 1.

It passes beneath the levator anguli scapulfje to the posterior superior angle of the scapula, passing along its posterior border between the rhomboids and serratus magnus, supply- L

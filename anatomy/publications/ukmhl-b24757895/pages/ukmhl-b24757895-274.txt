It fh'st flexes the joint between the middle and metacarpal phahinges, then the last phahmgeal joint, and thirdly the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation; but the latter can be fixed by the extensors, while the inter-phalangeal joints are bent by the superficial and deep flexors. Kerve.—The inner half by the ulnar, and outer half by the antei-ior interosseous. Varieties.—It may partly arise from the inner humeral condyle, or from the radius, or may have a distinct slip from the coronoid process of the ulna. It is pretty often connected with the flexor sublimis or longus poUicis. The slip from the coronoid process often constitutes a supplementary or accessory muscle, which variously joins one of the perforating tendons.

The Flexor Longus Pollicis arises from the u[)per two-thirds of the anterior grooved smface of the radius from the oblique line to the upper edge of the pronator quadratua, also from the adjoining part of the interosseous ligament, and sometimes by a round fleshy and tendinous slip, distinct from the rest of the rpuscle, from the inner part of the coronoid process of the ulna. This slip is internal to the attachment of the brachialis anticus. The fleshy fibres end in a flattened tendon which passes beneath the annular ligament and between the heads of the flexor brevis pollicis, then enters an osseo-fibrous canal, and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the thumb.

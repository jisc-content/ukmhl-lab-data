HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 466 peronei and separate them from the muscles on the anterior and posterior tibial regions, and after giving several smaller processes which enclose the muscles individually, gives off a broad transverse intermuscular septum which separates the superficial from the deep muscles. Laterally it is continued to the posterior margins of the tibia and fibula. Above, over the popliteus, it is strong and receives the expansion from the semi-mem- branosus. In the middle of the leg it is thinner, but behind the internal malleolus it is much thickened and covers the tendons of the tibialis posticus, flexor longus hallucis and flexor longus digitorum, enclosing them in osseo-fibrous sheaths between the heel and ankle. It also covers the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, and blends with the internal annular Fig. 346.—Muscles op right thigh and leg. Exteenal view. ligiament. This deep fascia is pierced by the cutaneous nerves and veins, which pass through it from the deep to the superficial vessels. Eeflect this fascia by an incision along the centre of the leg, and put on the stretch the fibres of the gastrocnemius, which is to be cleaned. Superficial Muscles.—These are the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris. The last-named is very small, having a very long tendon; the other two are large and fleshy, and end in a tendon common to both, the ' tendo-Achillis. The Gastrocnemius is the most superficial muscle, and arises by two heads, the inner of which is the larger, through two flat strong tendons from the back and upper part of the condyles. The inner layer and more

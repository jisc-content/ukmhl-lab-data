DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 375 internal lateral ligament of the knee. This expansion covers the insertions of the gracilis and semitendinosus, being partly united to them, and partly separated by a synovial bursa. An expansion from the upper margin of the sartorius aponeurosis blends with the fibrous capsule of the knee, and another from its lower border is continuous with the deep fascia on the. inner side of the leg. Relations.—It is. superficial throughout, and is pierced by some cuta- neous vessels and nerves. In the upper third of the thigh it forms the outer boundm-y of Scaii^a's triangle. In the middle-third of the thigh the supei-ficial femoral artery lies along its inner border and then passes Fig. 272.—iMuscLES of the left thigh. Internal view. behind the muscle. Its superficial surface is in relation with the skin, deep fascia and long saphenous vein ; its deep surface with the iliacus, psoas, rectus, vastus internus, anterior crural nerve, femoral sheath, adductor longus, adductor magnus, gracilis, long saphenous nerve and its patellar branch, and internal lateral ligament of the knee. Below the adductor opening for the femoral artery it bounds the popliteal space inter- nally and is placed between the vastus internus and adductor magnus in front, and the gracilis, semi-tendinosus and semi-membranosus behind. Action.—It flexes the knee and hip joints, and rotates the tibia ioi-

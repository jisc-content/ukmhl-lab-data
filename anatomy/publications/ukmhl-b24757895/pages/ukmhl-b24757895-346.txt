HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 310 it, an arrangement which is constant in many Apes, Carnivora, and Mar- supials. Prof. Struthers called particular attention to this structure several years ago in the 'British and Foreign Med.-Chi. Review,' 1854, and recently has exhibited his very interesting specimens at the Inter- national Medical Congress. He has shown that it is in several cases hereditary. I am indebted to his kindness for the accompanying illustra- tions. Radius.—Sometimes the ridge on the dorsal surface of its lower end is much developed, forming a prominence which should not be mistaken for an exostosis. Ulna.—Sometimes a small ulnar tuberosity is present just below the dorsal portion of the lesser sigmoid cavity, and the cartilage of the greater Fig. 226.—The supha-condyloid process in man.

One fourth the natural size. sigmoid cavity is often divided by a rough transverse line, which part, of the bone remains uncovered by cartilage. Carpal Bones.—An oa carpi centrale is occasionally found between the two rows of bones, and exists normally, according to Henke and Eeyher, in the embryo at the eighth week. Some one or other of the carpal bones may, in rare instances, be divided into two parts, the supernumerary portions being called secondary or accessory caipal bones. I have two or three times seen these varieties. Some of these varieties can only be ex- plained on the evolution theory, but the presence of the accessory radio- carpal can be explained by its development, as it is developed by two ossific centres. Exceptionally there are eleven carpal bones, and the magnum is sometimes divided into three pieces, of which one represents, according

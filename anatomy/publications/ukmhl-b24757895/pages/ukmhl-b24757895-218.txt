HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 182 capsule and its accessory ligaments tense; the shaft is moved back around the line before mentioned, and the great tuberosity is revolved backwards. The muscles are the main agents in limiting all these motions, but the upper thicker part of the capsule, with the anterior and posterior parts just mentioned, assist in checking the movements. The Shoulder Joint.—This is an arthrodial or ball-and-socket joint, and the lai-ge rounded head of the humerus, with the shallow glenoid fossa of the scapula, enters into its foramen. The bones are kept in position by the tensity of the suvrovmding muscles and by atmospheric pressure, and not by the tension of its ligaments, which are loose, and which, if tense, would restrict the movements of the joints. Its ligaments are capsular, coraco-humeral, gleno-humeral, and glenoid, the two former being extra- and the two latter being intra-irticular. The Capsular Ligament loosely surrounds the articular ends of the Dones. It is strengthened by processes from the neighbouring tendons Fig. 105.—Antero-postjskior transverse section through the right shoulder TO SHOW its relations. and is thicker above than below. Above it is attached to the circum- ference of the glenoid cavity rather beyond the glenoid ligament, being partly blended with it, and below it is fixed to the anatomical neck of the humerus, being nearer to the articular cartilage above than in the rest of its attachment, and is strongest at its upper aspect. It is sufficiently loose to allow of the separation of the humerus from the scapula for about an inch if the muscles be cut. It is pierced opposite the bicipital groove by the long head of the biceps, and below it is connected with the long head of the triceps. It usually has three openings, one on the inner side below the coracoid process for the bursa or synovial process imder the sub- scapularis tendon; another, which is inconstant, at the outer and back

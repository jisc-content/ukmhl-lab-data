Tlie external runs out beneath the tendons of the'extensor longus digitorum and extensor poUicis, supplying the outer side of the ankle and anastomosing with the anterior peroneal artery, and with ascending branches from the tarsal branch of the dorsalis pedis. Some small articular twigs pierce the anterior ligament of the ankle joint, and are given off from the lower end of the vessel. The Dorsalis Pedis Artery is the continuation of the anterior tibial, and commences at the lower pnrt of the anterior annular ligament, and passes to the back part of the first interosseous space, where it gives off two branches, the dorsalis pollicis and communicating.

Above it are the skin, fascia, and the innermost tendon of tlbe extensor brevis digitorum near its termination. At its inner side is the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis, and at its outer the innei-most tendon of the extensor longus digi- torum and the end of the anterior tibial nerve. It has two venjB comites. Branches.—These are mainly directed outwards and forwards upon the tarsus and metatarsus, and are named accordingly. A few twigs run obliquely inwards upon the inner side of the foot. A small interosseous branch supplies the first interosseous muscle. The Tarsal Artery is usually given off opposite the scaphoid bone, but its point of origin may vary. It passes out upon the tarsal bones

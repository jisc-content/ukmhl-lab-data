407 niSSEVTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. brevis digitonim, and at the outer border of the latter, between it and the abductor minimi digiti, it divides into a superficial and a deep branch. Before division it supplies the abductor minimi digiti and flexor acces- sorius. The Superficial branch separates into two digital nerves, the smaller of which supplies the outer side of the little toe and the flexor brevis minimi digiti and the two interossei muscles of the fourth metatarsal space. The larger digital branches supply the adjacent sides of the fourth and fifth toes, and join the last digital branch of the internal plantar nerve. The deep or muscular branch of this nerve will be presently dis- sected. Directions.—Cut the internal plantar artery and nerve near the heel, Fig. 372.—Nerves of the uiwht sole. and throw them forwards. Clean the external plantar ai'tery and nerve, and remove any connective tissue and fat from the toes. Second Muscular Layer.—The tendons of the long flexors of the toes, that of the flexor longus pollicis, the flexor accessorius, and the lumbri- cales will now be exposed. The tendon of the flexor longus digitorum enters the sole of the foot beneath the internal annular ligament, and passes obliquely out towards its centre, where it is joined on its outer side by the flexor accessorius. It is also connected here with the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis, over which (in this position) it passes to the centre of the foot; it expands, and after being joined by the accessorius divides into four tendons which enter the flexor sheaths ivith and beneath the corresponding tendon from the flexor brevis, which it perforates about the middle of the first phalanges. It is finally inserted into the bases of the distal ])halanges of the four outer toes. Between these tendons are the lumbricales muscles and the vin- K K

270 HUMAN MOltrHOLOGY. The reason of this arrangement will be better understood in considering the action of these muscles. Actions.—The palmar interossei are all adductors to the middle finger. It has been previously shown that the dorsal muscles were abductors from the same point. The middle finger has no palmar interosseous because it is the midline, and therefore cannot be dra^vn any nearer to that point but as the qthpr three digits can be approximated to the middle fingers Bad. art.

The dotted line through the middle finger is to njake plainer tbe action of the palmar interossei and adductors towards it. they have special palmar adductors. The thumb of course does not need an interosseous adductor, as it has a special one, but the little finger not being provided with a special adductor needs, and is furnished with, a palmar interosseous adductor. Nerve.—The ulnar nerve. Vai'ieties.—They may be double in one or more of the spaces, and Axis of hand 1 2 3 Fia 188.—Transverse vertical section op metacarpals and interossei of LEFT HAND (UPPER PART OF SECTION). The numbers indicate the palmar interossei; the dorsal are not numbered. rarely there is a palmar interosseous in the first space. The usual arrange- ment of the palmar interossei of the foot, which is peculiar to man, has also been noticed to occur in the hand, i.e. the three palmar interossei may be connected with the three inner metacarpal bones. Dissection.—Remove the small muscles of the thumb and little finger from the annular ligament, place its cut ends together, and subsequently

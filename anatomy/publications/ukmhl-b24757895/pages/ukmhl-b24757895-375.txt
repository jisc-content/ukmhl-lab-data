339 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. on the inside of the thigh, accompanying the saphena vein. In some subjects, these small filaments arise directly from the anterior crural, and they frequently join with each other. The topmost filament passes through the saphenous opening and reaches to the middle of the thigh, another larger than the rest appears about the middle of the thigh near the vein extending as far as the knee, and a third pierces the fascia at its lower thii-d. The Anterior Branch perforates the fascia in the lower third of the thigh, and divides into two branches, the inner of which runs down near the internal intermuscular septum and supplies the skin over the lower third of the thigh and inner side of the knee, and joins the inner branch cut. Fig. 23(5.â€”Cutaneous nerves op the front of the left lower limb piercing the deep fascia. of the middle cutaneous ; the outer one crosses the patella and joins the patellar branch of the long or internal saphenous nerve above the joint, and sometimes takes its place. Occasionally, the internal cutaneous is above the fascia in its whole length, and sometimes it gives off a filament which accompanies the saphenous vein and may join the internal branch now to be described. The Internal Branch runs along the posterior border of the sartorius, pierces the fascia at the inner side of the knee, gives off several cutaneous filaments to the lower and inner side of the thigh, and joins by a small branch the internal saphenous which here lies in front of it.

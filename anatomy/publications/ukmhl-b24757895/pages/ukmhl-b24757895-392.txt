HUMAN MORPHOLOGY 356 The spermatic cord must be divided just before it enters the internal abdominal ring, and the sub-psritoneal cellulo-fatty tissue is to be carefully separated from the iliac fossa and abdominal wall by similar transverse incisions. The abdominal aspect of the inner femoral ring and femoral sheath are to be cieaned, and the fascia transversalis in front, and fascia iliaca behind, should be traced to and beneath Poupart's ligament, so as to make out the formation of the femoral sheath. That part of the sub- or supra-peritoneal cellulo-fatty tissue which covers the internal femoral ring should be left; it is the septum femorale, and a lymphatic gland is commonly found on it. In this dissection some lymphatic glands on the Postr. layer of sheath of rectus Liuea alba Fig. 255.—Inguinal and femoral canals seen from their abdominal aspects. The ilia and rami ot pubes cut and lower part of the riplit rectus removed. The posterior sui'faces of the inner and outer pillars are shown on each side of the external riuR. The anterior layer of the rectal sheath is shown just below the divided rectus on the right of the figure, and tlie lines just external to the epigastric vessels indicate the separation of the two layers. sides of the iliac vessels will be exposed, and the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve will be seen on the iliac artery. Deeper Kelations of the Internal Femoral Eing.—In front and above are the spermatic cord in the male (formed by the vas deferens, spermatic artery, spermatic veins, nerves, lymphatics, and the cremaster muscle), and the round ligament in the female. The femoral vein is on the outer side, and the epigastric arteiy is at the upper and outer angle of the ring. The pubic or communicating branch between the obturator and epigastric lies in front of and internal to the ring. The student will observe that the circumference of the ring- is bounded

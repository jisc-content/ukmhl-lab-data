HUMAN MOnrHOLOGY. 280 Superior Radial Ulnar Joint.—In this articulation are the inner side of the cu'cumference of the radial head and the lesser sigmoid cavity of the idna. It is a lateral ginglymus, and its surfaces are covered with cartilage and lined by a pouch of the synovial membrane of the elbow^ joint, and it has but one ligament. The Orbicular or Annular Ligament is a strong flat band of ligamentous fibres about a quarter of an inch wide. It is stronger behind, and forms four- fifths of a circle which surrounds the head of the radius, keeping it firmly in 12 3. Ant. rndio carp. 4. Fibro-cart. C. Ulno-cai'p. 6 7 8. Iiitercarp. 9.

It is broader at the upper part of its circumference, and there secm^ely keeps the radius in its position. Its lower edge is free and fits round the neck of the radius. Its outer surface is strengthened by the external lateral ligament of the elbow, and the supinator brevis arises from it. Its inner surface is smooth and covered by the synovial membrane, and parts of the external and anterior ligaments of the elbow are connected with its upper border.

DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 413 vilddle ^ayer passes underneath the ghiteus maxirnus, and joins the superficial at its lower border forming a complete sheath for it. The two layers after meeting are continued outwards to join the fascia lata. At the inner and upper parts it })asses to the perineum and is attached to the great sacro-sciatic ligament with the inferior aponeurosis of the levator ani. Towards the middle line it is fixed to the sacrum and coccyx. The deep Layer covers the gluteus medius and is attached inferiorly to the ■ great sacro-sciatic ligament. The Gluteus Maxirnus is the largest muscle of the body, and the most superficial in this region, and extends from the back of the pelvis to the upper part of the femm- and fascia lata. It is a broad and thick fleshy mass of a quadrilateral shape, and its structure is coarse, being made up of Fig. 299.—Superficial dissectiok of eight gluteal region. many bundles of separate muscular fasciculi lying parallel with each other. Its origin is partly bony and partly tendinous. It arises from the superior curved line of the ilium, and the posterior third of the iliac crest, and from an impression of the bone below it. From the posterior surface of the last piece of the sacrum, from the side of the coccyx, from the aponeurosis covering the multifidus spinse, and from the back of the great sacro-sciatic and posterior sacral ligaments. The fibres pass obliquely down and out to be inserted, thus : those forming the larger upper portion of the muscle con- verge and terminate in a thickish lamina which passes over the great tro- chanter to be inserted into the fascia lata on the outer side of the thigh. The lower ])ortion of the muscle is inserted for about three inches into the rough line leading from the liuea aspera to the great troclianter. This

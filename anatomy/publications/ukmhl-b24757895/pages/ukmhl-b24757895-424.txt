388 HUMAN MORPHOLOGY The Middle Cutaneous perforates the fascia lata, and sometimes the sartorius also, about three inches below Poupart's ligament, and extends to the knee. It has already been dissected. The Interned Cutaneous gives olf two or more branches which pierce the fascia lata and supply the skin of the upper third of the thigh. It then divides in front, or to the inner side of the femoral artery, into an anterior and inner branch. Sometimes these branches are given off separately from the anterior crural. The Anterior Branch lies over the sartorius as far as the middle of Ant. crnral niacus Psoas (cut) Ext. iliac and », femoral arteries E.Kt. cut", nerve.

The sartorius is pierced by the middle cutaneous. the thigh, and then pierces the fascia lata to supply the skin as far as the inner side of the knee. The inner branch, while beneath the deep fascia, runs along the inner border of the sartorius, and about the middle of the thigh joins in the femoral plexus. It is beneath the deep fascia as far as the knee, and near the knee it joins a branch of the internal saphenous nerve. The Internal Saphenous Nerve is the largest branch of the superficial division of the anterior crural. It accompanies the femoral vessels, lying on their outer side, and is contained in Hunter's canal as far as the adductor

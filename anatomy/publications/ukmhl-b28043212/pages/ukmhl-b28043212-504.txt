484 MALFORMATIONS. not hold good in relation to the father. In this class we may also include the cases in which several children, whose parents present no peculiarity, suffer from the same mal- formations. Cases of this kind are by no means unfrequent, and may be daily observed. A large number has been collected by Meckel. ee, Gurlt,f and Henle.J The great majority of these cases admit of no other expla- nation than that the malformation had its origin in an ongina abnormality of the generative matter. But in what this abnormality consists, and how it operates, are points upon which really nothing is known, although, in solitary instances, an abnormal condition of the semen, (of the seminal animal- cules,) or of the ovum (of the yelk) has been observed.* * * § 2. As a second series of causes which, after impregnation has been effected, possibly take a part in the production of malformations, may be considered, abnormalities of the ma- ternal organism:—pathological alterations in the fallopian tubes and the uterus, bodily diseases and psychical affections of the mother. Of all these causes it may, with probability, be conjectured that they exercise a disturbing influence upon development, hut we are still very far from knowing in what this consists, and what share it exerts in the production of malformations. It is probable that these causes operate by arresting and interrupting development, and consequently givino- rise to various malformations by arrest of struc- ture. We must here also notice the opinion that some mal- formations owe their origin to an influence on the imagination of the mother during pregnancy—a psychical affection, m consequence of which the foetus is stated to bear upon it * Op. cit. vol. i. p. 15—59. + Op cit. vol. ii. p- 5 172. - l Zeitscbr. f. rat.

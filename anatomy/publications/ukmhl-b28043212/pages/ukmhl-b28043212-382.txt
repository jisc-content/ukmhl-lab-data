PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 362 to rattle within the stone, which could only be explained by a similar drying of mucus. Sometimes the calculus consists of gravel or several minute stones, united together by a cement which is occasionally of the same nature as the concretions. The occurrence of urinary calculi depends, as has been before mentioned, upon diet, but also on climate and other local relations, such even as the nature of the soil. The further prosecution of this inquiry, however important it may be to the right knowledge of the origin and mode of treatment of urinary calculi, appertains, more properly speak- ing, to pathology than to pathological anatomy.* We must accurately distinguish from urinary calculi those concretions which arc not formed in the urinary system, but in the organs of generation. To these belong concretions of the prostate gland. Pros- tatic calculi have, for the most part, very characteristic properties, by which they may be easily recognized; they are always small, somewhat about the size of a pin’s head, and are usually of a brownish, reddish-brown, or yellowish-brown colour. They are crystalline or laminated, and frequently exhibit a polyhedric or facetted surface, like a granule of phosphate of lead fused before the blow-pipe. Their chemical constituents are phosphate of lime, with a little animal and colouring matter. They are doubtlessly formed by a precipitate of phosphate of lime, but the causes which tend to their formation are not accurately known.f * See Windemuth, de lithiasi endemica, Marburgi, 1842; a work with copious references; and H.

87 PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. whole of the affected part, but that it follows the course of the capillaries, while the interstices remain colourless * On cutting into the hypenemic organ, a more than ordinary quantity of blood escapes, in which the corpuscles are normal, or only slightly modified. The affected part is also denser than usual; the consistence is either normal or apparently softened; it is never increased, unless, in addition to the hypertemia, there is also a deposition of coagulated fibrin. The above relations are sufficient to render the diagnosis a matter of certainty. It can only be confounded with extravasation of blood, and with infiltration of dissolved haematin. The points serving to distinguish between them will be found in our remarks on these pathological con- ditions. Causes, mode of formation, and termination.—Hypenemia of the capillary vessels is dependant on two forces (momenten) —on a dilatation of the capillaries, and on the accumulation (and retardation) of the blood-corpuscles in them. 'Hie causes of these two forces, their mutual dependance, and the manner in which the whole process is conducted, belong to a depart- ment of pathology in which our knowledge is by no means accurate. To follow out this subject would lead us into the obscure domain of nervous pathology, and the physiology of tissues; we shaU confine our remarks at present to those points which more especially fall within the range of patholo gical anatomy. In many cases capillary hypercemia is undoubtedly depen- dant on the nervous system; this, from whatever cause it is induced, gives rise to dilatation of the capillaries and relaxa- tion of their walls: the dilated capillaries receive, on purely mechanical grounds, more blood than they previously did; and a capillary which in its normal condition could admit of the passage of only a single row of corpuscles, may now admit of two or tlirce. At the same time an excess of plasma escapes * See pi. n. %• 1, b.

EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. 544 PLATE IV. EPIGENESIS OF AREOLAR TISSUE AND ORGANIC MUSCULAR FIBRE. Fig. 1. Newly formed areolar tissue, in various stages of development, from a false membrane in tlie pleura. A young man was attacked with inflammation of the right pleura, which was succeeded by very considerable empyema. As the diffi- culty of respiration was so great as to threaten daily suffocation, paracentesis thoracis was had recourse to, by which a very considerable amount of fluid was discharged. The fluid coagulated spontaneously, and had the same chemical composition as the plasma of the blood. It was again formed with such rapidity, that the operation had to be twice repeated. Soon after the last operation (on which occasion the fluid did not spontaneously coagulate, but was a mere admixture of serum with a little pus), the patient died. On dissection, the right pleura was everywhere invested with a false membrane, which formed a shut sac, containing a yellowish «erum with a deposit of blood-corpuscles. This membrane varied in thickness from half a line to a line ; when examined under the microscope, it was found to exhibit traces of more or less advanced organization. The most recent layer, lying next to the pleural cavity, was partially fibrous, and contained many nuclei (A), toge- ther with numerous globules and granules of fat. On the addition of ammonia it became pale and transparent, the fatty granules being the only element unaffected by this re-agent. The mass that pre- sented itself after the removal of the most recent layers, consisted of irregular, for the most part elongated, membranous particles (ce , B), containing one or more nuclei. Some of these.cell, were very irregular and composite (B. «.). while others had the ordmary form of the caudate, fusiform, fibrous cells of areolar tissue (B. b.)

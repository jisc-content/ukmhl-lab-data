420 PARASITES. CHAPTER VIII. INDEPENDENT ORGANISMS IN THE HUMAN BODY. PARASITES. All the pathological formations which have been hitherto considered are products of the formative power proper to the organism; however much they deviate in form, they are still parts of the body. Contrasted with these, are other forma- tions in the human subject, which must be regarded, not as parts of the body, but as independent individuals, although their presence is more or less due to the condition of the organism in which they are found. These independent organisms are termed parasites, and they so far have a bear- ing on pathological anatomy, that they are, more or less, connected with pathological conditions. As all self-existing organisms which are found upon the earth range themselves in two great natural kingdoms, that of plants and animals, so also do these parasites. Hence we distinguish parasitic plants, without animal motion, with simple organization, developing themselves, and growing after the manner of plants; and parasitic animals which, as re- gard motion, organization, and propagation, belong to the animal kingdom. But the line of demarcation between the two natural kingdoms is so indefinite, that with our present means of determination, it sometimes remains doubtful whether an organized individual must be regarded as a plant or an animal â€” as, for example, in the case of bacillaria, closteria, and other allied species, which some, with Ehrenberg, include in the infusoria; while others, with equal propriety, refer them to the vegetable kingdom.

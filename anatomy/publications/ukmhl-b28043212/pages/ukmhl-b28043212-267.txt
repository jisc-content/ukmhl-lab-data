247 ENCYSTED TUMOURS. When the cyst resembles a serous membrane, and throws off little or no epithelium, these cells are comparatively rare, or appear to be altogether absent. In other instances, on the contrary, the cells prevail, and sometimes, indeed, form almost the whole contents. The last described encysted tumours have, generally, a thin surrounding membrane without secreting glands. 2. Fatty matters of various kinds are almost invariably present in the contents of these tumours. They arc partly the ordinary fats of the human body—olein and margarin, and oleie, margarie, and butyric acids; partly cholesterin. They occur in the most varied proportions, and consequently, although encysted tumours can be arranged into well marked groups, they are not strictly separable from each other. Sometimes the fats predominate ; being cither the common fats—olein and margarin—when the contents consist of irregular drops or masses, or when cells tilled with fat, resembling the normal fat-cells are present: these form the transition from the encysted to the capsular fatty tumours, but are compara- tively rare;—or the contents consist for the most part of cholesterin, which occurs partly in the amorphous state, and partly in the form of distinct crystalline tables.* This variety of encysted tumour frequently presents, upon the interior of the cyst, several superimposed layers of cholesterin which glisten like mother of pearl; it was, therefore, named the laminated nacreous fatty tumour by Cruveilhier, and cholesteatoma bv Miiller.t These groups are, however, not strictly separated, since in different encysted tumours the individual fats are not merely mixed with each other, but also with the previously described cells in the most diversified proportions.

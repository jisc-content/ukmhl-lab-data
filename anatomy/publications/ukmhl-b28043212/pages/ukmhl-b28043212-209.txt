189 ELASTIC TISSUE—GRANULAR PIGMENT. EPIGENESIS OF ELASTIC TISSUE. Elastic tissue consists of fibrous elements, and closely approximates, histologically, to the fibres ot areolar tissue, of fibrous tissue, and of simple muscular fibre. The chief distinction between it and them is a chemical one, namely, the insolubility of its fibres in acetic acid ; it is also morpho- logically distinguished from the above tissues by the fact that its fibres are thicker than those of areolar and fibrous tissues; while, on the other hand, they are thinner than those of simple muscle. It is further characterized by a frequent dichotomic separation, and reticulated ramification of its fibres. The nucleated fibres of areolar tissue range themselves immediately with those of elastic tissue ; they may, indeed, be considered as a degeneration of these latter.* Pathological epigeneses of this tissue doubtless sometimes occur; they are, however, but imperfectly known. It has been already observed, that in pathological epigeneses of areolar tissue, nucleated fibres sometimes occur amongst its ordinary elements. In scirrhus, I have myself frequently observed an epigenesis of genuine reticulated elastic tissue, as I shall show in the section on that morbid process. MELANOSIS. In the normal body, granular pigment holds a very subordinate place. It is found only in the eye, and in some individuals also in the hair, and in some parts of the skin.f It consists of fine granular molecules of brown or black colour, which are usually enclosed in cells of different forms and size. This is the case in the choroid coat of the eye and * Full information respecting the histological relations of this tissue may be found in Henlc’s Allgem. Anat. p. 399. Plate n. fig. 9, 10, 11.

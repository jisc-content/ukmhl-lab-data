57 DROPSIES. examined under the microscope, their capillaries appear to be distended and filled with blood.* When the parenchyma becomes infiltrated by the fluid, there is at first a soft, doughy swelling, such as occurs in serous dropsy; when, however, the fibrin coagulates, the tumour becomes hard, and, on making a section through it, appears firm and lardaceous. Since, however, in inflamma- tory affections of the external organs, the fibrinous fluid is usually poured forth very gradually from the capillaries, the first portion coagulates before the second is effused; hence, the tumour is commonly firm and resistent from the time it is first observed. When effusion takes place in a serous cavity, it gives rise to distention of the enclosing membrane ; and, hence, to compression of the surrounding parts. The fibrinous effusion is of most common occurrence after pleuritis, or pericarditis ; it is more rare after peritonitis suc- ceeding paracentesis. In the dead body it is usually found in a coagulated state. 3. FALSE DROPSY. In the early systems of pathology, many cases were regarded as dropsies, in which fluids collected in the secreting organs, or in their discharging passages, in consequence of some impediment to their exit. Thus, we read of dropsy of the kidneys (hydrops renum), of the uterus (hydrometra), of the fallopian tubes, of the gall-bladder, of the appendix vermiformis of the caecum, and of the lachrymal sac. These dropsies belong neither to serous nor to fibrinous dropsy. They arise from the duct of the secreting organ being, in some part of its course, either temporarily or permanently closed. In consequence of this impediment, the fluid accu- mulates in the secreting organ, and in its discharging duct as far as the obstruction, distending those parts. The fluid in this form of dropsy, is, therefore, originally identical with * See pi. ii. fig. 1.

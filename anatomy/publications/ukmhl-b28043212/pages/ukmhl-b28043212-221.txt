CARTILAGE AND BONE. 201 lamellae—in which the osseous corpuscles are formed. But since these ramifying canals extend over the original carti- lage-cells (indeed frequently the canals proceeding from the different bone-corpuscles appear to be in contact) they must enter the intercellular substance either by resorption or prolongation. Together with these morphological changes, some of a chemical nature take place. The osseous substance becomes impregnated with calcareous salts, whilst its organic basis either remains chondrin, as in most pathological forma- tions of bone, or is converted into common gelatin (colla).* Whether a formation of cartilage invariably precedes the pathological formation of bone has never been determined by direct observation ; the analogy of the normal formation, how- ever, renders this probable. In the regeneration of bone the pre-formation of cartilage is undoubted. Very many of what are termed pathological formations of bone or ossifications are nothing more than concretions, of which we shall speak hereafter. In the foregoing pages we have considered the most im- portant of the elementary tissues which admit of pathological re-formation: there are some others whose epigenesis can only occur under definite and very limited conditions—as hair, nails, teeth, and glands, which will be considered in their proper places. * For full particulars respecting the morbid as well as the normal formation of bone, the reader may consult, in addition to the works of Henle and Valentin already quoted : BischofFs Entwicklungsgeschichte, p. 432; Miescher de inftammatione ossium eorumquc anatomia gencrali, Berol. 1836 ; Mayer in Muller’s Archiv. 1841, p. 210; Flcischmann in ditto, 1843, p. 202 ; Bidder in ditto, 1843, p. 372.

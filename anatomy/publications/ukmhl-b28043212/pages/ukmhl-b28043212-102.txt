82 PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. in the lower animals. This subject will be fully discussed in the chapter on parasites. We are indebted to J. Engel* for a meritorious essay which has been lately published on the theory of the changes which the blood undergoes generally, as far as they can be revealed by the different pathological conditions observable after death. The following are the most important of his conclusions : | In suppurative fermentation (Eitergilhrung) the blood loses i its tendency to coagulate; it is of a dirty dark red colour, does not become brighter on exposure to the atmosphere, and is very fluid. The corpse appears swollen, and presents a dirty appearance, being marked with numerous death-spots, - partly hypostases and partly sugillations. After inflammatory affections and tuberculosis, numerous fibrinous coagula are found in the blood, the clot is large and hard, and the blood more consistent than in the normal state. The sugillations are fewer and not so diffused, and their colour is less deep. In typhus and miliary tuberculosis the blood has a dark violet tint, is viscid, and exhibits no tendency to form a consistent clot. It is slow in reddening when exposed to the air, has no peculiar hypostatic tendency, but communi- cates to the organs, a dark violet, or reddish brown tint, by the firm adhesion of its colouring matter. In the cancerous dyscrasia, the blood is of a dark colour, very slight consistence, does not readily coagulate, reddens imperfectly or not at all on exposure to the air, and exhibits a hypostatic tendency. The colour of the dead body is of no diagnostic importance, in consequence of the slight viscidity of the blood, and the consequently slight adhesive power of the colouring matter. In dropsy, the blood is not deeply coloured, and is very * Roser und Wunderlichâ€™s Arcliiv. vol. i. p. 53o, &c.

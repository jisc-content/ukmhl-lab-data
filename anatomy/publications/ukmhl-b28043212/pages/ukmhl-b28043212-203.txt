EPIGENESIS OF FAT. 183 respecting the formation of fat from the food, which we shall not at present consider, in consequence of the undecided state in which it remains. Very probably, in all cases where fat is produced, not only the cvtoblastema, but also the blood from which it is derived, is more than usually abundant in fat. We often, indeed, meet with fat occurring as tat-glo- bules and granules in many amorphous blastemata ; this fat remains, whilst the rest of the blastema disappears either by resorption or organization, and in this manner those patholo- gical collections of fat are formed which we find in a crystal- lized state. Whether fat can arise from the protein-compounds of an exudation, or from its other constituents, through a chemical metamorphosis, must be left at present undecided, as also must the question, whether, under certain conditions, a plasma consisting entirely or principally of fat can be sepa- rated from the blood; in other words, whether the vessels can in a direct manner secrete fat. If this were the cast*, the process of the formation of fat would be much simplified, and more easily explained. There is no doubt that in many cases actual fat is secreted by peculiar morbidly formed secreting organs, similar to the sebaceous glands of the skin, the ceruminous glands, &c. which in the normal state secrete fat. This is, for instance, the case in many kinds of encysted tumours. Of the development of organized adipose tissue and fat- cells we have no certain knowledge; indeed we do not know in what manner the normal formation of fatty tissue occurs. We may assume that in accordance with the general scheme of cellular formation, cells arise from a cvtoblastema more or less similar to the blood-plasma, and that at a later period they become filled with fat, or that a cell-wall occurs as a secondary formation around the fat-globules, whereby, pro- bably, Ascherson’s* theory of the formation of the haptogen * Muller’s Archiv. 1840, p. 44, Sc.

PRECIPITATES OF AM MONIACO-M AGNESI AN PHOSPHATE. 345 free carbonic acid which pervades all the usual juices, become decomposed, and form carbonate of lime. Sulphate of lime is probably an occasional constituent of precipitates; it has, however, not yet been observed. 5. Ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate is crystalline; its tform, however, varies in accordance with the rapidity with â–  which its crystals are produced. If formed quickly we have -stellar groups consisting of acicular crystals, or leafy aggre- gations presenting a great similarity to the indented leaves of ;.the leontodon taraxicum.* The crystals, when slowly pro- duced, have a very characteristic form ; their regular appear- ance being that of a three-sided prism, in which the angles at the extremities of one margin are truncated by planes pass- ing through the opposite angles at either end. Sometimes other corresponding angles are also truncated, as in fig. 4 b and c of Plate x.f It is not easy to explain the causes of the numerous deviations in form, which these crystals present, and to reduce them to their common primary form, which appears to be the rhombic prism. 1 Crystals of ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate are insoluble in water, alcohol, ether, and alkalies, but dissolve readily, and without effervescence in acetic and the mineral acids. This chemical reaction, combined with their characteristic crystal- line form, renders their diagnosis sufficiently easy. The former and less decided crystalline fonn of precipitate, generally speaking, only occurs when ammonia is added to the animal fluids, and a rapid precipitate is thus induced. Precipitates formed naturally within the body appear, as far as my expe- rience goes, to consist invariably of the latter and more perfect form of cry stals. * See Simon, op. cit. fig. 30, where, however, most of the crystals exhibit a more perfect form. f See Plate x. fig. 4 a, or Simon, op. cit. fig. 27.

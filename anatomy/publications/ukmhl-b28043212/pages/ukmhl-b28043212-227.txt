vascular tumours. 207 of them arc quite inexplicable, as, for instance, the formation of hair, teeth, and bone in encysted tumours of the ovaries. When a tumour is once formed, it takes its share with the rest of the body in the general metamorphosis of tissue, and the part is often an active one, since most of these tumours possess considerable vascularity, and there can be no doubt that they usually owe their increase to the irritation which they set up in the surrounding parts, their vessels becoming hvpenemic, and therefore yielding more than the ordinary quantity of cytoblastema. Most of the above tumours may be arranged under one of the following groups. FIRST GROUP. TUMOURS CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OP VESSELS. Vascular Tumours. Non-malignant tumours which consist principally of blood- vessels with small quantities of intermediate areolar tissue have received the name Telangiectases. More or less syno- nymous with these are those denominated: Aneurysma per anastomosin, Tumeur Erectile, Tumor splenoides, Hanna- toma, Hmnatoncus, Nannis vasculosus, &e. These tumours are of red or bluish-red colour, of various forms and sizes, more or less firm, and more or less capable of temporary erection, like the normal erectile tissues. They generally appear on the external skin, or in the subjacent cellu- lar tissue upon various parts of the body ; as on the head, scalp, cheeks, eyelids and lips, also on the trunk, the arms and the lower extremities. They are usually congenital but afterwards increase in size; in some cases, however, they are first produced after birth ; and occur both in children and in adults, often without any perceptible cause, but sometimes after a mechanical injury, as for instance, a | contusion.

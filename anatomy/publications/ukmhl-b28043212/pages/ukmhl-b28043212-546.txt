It is only in occasional cases that we have the oppor- tunity in the human subject of examining diseased parts of the body whilst perfectly fresh, such as extirpated tumours or amputated extremities. In general, a shorter or longer period elapses between death and the examination, and during this interval, through the agency of putrefaction, changes frequently occur in the elements of the body which may be easily confounded with such alterations as, during life, were produced by disease. The study of cadaveric changes is, therefore, necessary, lest false conclusions should be drawn from the state of the corpse, with respect to existing patho- logical alterations. It has, however, still another object which is of more espe- cial importance in relation to medical jurisprudence, and consists in the reply to certain questions which are frequently put to the medical jurist. Such queries are chiefly as follows : 1. Has a person died a natural or violent death ? 2. How long a period has elapsed since his death ? 3. In what condition was the corpse found ? The cadaveric changes interest us here chiefly with refe- rence to the first question. They are commonly placed in direct opposition to those which take place during life, and the two {ire held to be essentially different, since, as it is reasoned, the latter have arisen under the influence of the vital force, while the former, on the contrary, have resulted in accordance with totally different laws, namely, the strictly

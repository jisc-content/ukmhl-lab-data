Exuda- 1 ions undergoing incipient putrefaction—as, for instance, ichor i-—do not become organized ; and where the composition of the I flood, (and consequently the exudation proceeding from it,) differs considerably from the normal type—as is probably uhe case in typhus and scrophulosis—either no organi- sation follows or else it occurs very imperfectly, as we shall presently see when speaking of typhous matter, scrophulous idepositions, and similar products. 2. The nature of the development is influenced by the his- Uologieal elements of the part in which the epigenesis occurs. If the influence of these parts predominates, the newly formed material resembles the pre-existing normal tissue, and thus in morbid hypertrophy, in regeneration of lost parts, &c., the i process is just the same as in ordinary nutrition.* This important law which plays a very active part in pathological epigenesis, I will for brevity term “ the law of analogous formation.” The law of analogous formation, is, however, essentially modified bv the nature and vital properties of the parts in question : A. The more complex in structure the tissue is in which the epigenesis occurs, so much the less does it resemble the normal elements. Areolar tissue, osseous tissue and simple (non-striated) muscular fibre are easily reproduced, II nerves not so readily and more slowly, whilst complex organs, such as the tissue of the lungs, brain, &c., are either not ! reproduced at all, or only very imperfectly. The extent of this law varies considerably in different organisms; while in men and the higher animals, the regenerative power is very ! limited, or, if I may use the expression, the power of pro- ducing histological elements from the cytoblastema is at its * This law is clearly laid down by Meckel; he observes that morbid epigeneses resemble the adjacent normal structures.

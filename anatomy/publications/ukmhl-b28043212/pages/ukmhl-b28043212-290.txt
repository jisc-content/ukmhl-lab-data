PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 270 FIRST CLASS. PSEUDOPLASMATA SLIGHTLY OR NOT AT ALL ORGANIZED. The tumours belonging to this class are characterized by the circumstance, that during the whole process of their development, from their first appearance to their softening, they show a very low degree of organization. The mass forming them appears either entirely indeterminate and amorpho-granular, or it attains, in the most highly developed cases, to a very imperfect cellular structure: the product of their softening is an indeterminate granular detritus. Morphologically, as well as pathologically, (that is to say in relation to the concomitant local morbid phenomena), these new formations are most closely allied to ulceration, from which indeed they cannot be strictly separated. In general, however, they do not remain local, but appear simultaneously on several parts of the body. But this propagation does not, as in the more highly organised pseudoplasmata, depend upon the conversion (in conformity with the law of analogous formation) of the nutritive fluid in their vicinity into a mass resembling them, but is rather due to the same cause which gave rise to the first pseudoplasma becoming repeated in its vicinity or in a distant part of the body. The cavities and ulcers produced by the softening of these depositions can, therefore, spontaneously heal with much greater facility, than those which ensue from the softening of the more highly organised pseudoplasmata. From the second class—the more highly organised pseudo- plasmata—they are histologically distinct, although even here transition forms are not wanting. They appear absolutely non-vascular, and if vessels are found in them, these are not of recent development, but belong to the normal tissues, amongst which the epigenesis was deposited.

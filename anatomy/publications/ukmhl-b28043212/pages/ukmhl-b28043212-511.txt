491 DEFICIENT MONSTERS. The literature relating to acephali is very abundant, and the number of cases of this malformation which have been observed in the human subject may, perhaps, amount to 100; in animals they are less frequent. The most important information may be found in Meckel, vol. i. p. 140, &c.; Fr. Tiedmann, Anatomie der kopflosen Missgeburten. Landshut, 1813, with plates; E. Elben, de acephalis s. monstris corde carentibus. Berol, 1821 c. tab. (which contains an enumeration of most of the cases on record); and Geoifroy St. Hilaire, vol. n. p. 464. More recent cases are described by Ploteuhauer, de monstro acephalo lmmano. Berol. 1835 ; Hildreth and Houston, in Valentin's Repertorium, 1837, p. 170; P. J. Gergens, Anat. Beschreib, eines merkw. Accphnlus. Giessen, 1830; J. H. Kalck, Monstr. acephal. hum. expos. anat. Berol, 1825 ; Herholdt, Beschreibung sechs menschl. Missgeburten. Kopenhagen, 1830, p. 21 and 38 ; Otto, op. cit. p. 4. &c. On the circulation in the acardiac acephali, see Holland, “ on the circulation in the acardiac foetus.” Edin. Med. and Surg. Journal, 1845, vol. lxii. p. 156, &c. Geoifroy St. Hilaire subdivides the acephali into three genera : 1. True aaphali, with perfect, or almost perfect thorax, which supports both upper extremities, or at least oue of them. 3. Peracephali, without upper extremities. 3. Mylucephali, with very anomalous body, and either with very defective, rudimentary extremities, or with no limbs at all. 5. Malformations in which not the whole head, but some of its component parts are wanting—monsters with defective head (pyocephalus).* Malformations of this kind are very frequent in the human subject. They may l>e reduced to several subdivisions, some of which form well-characterized groups. a. The head may be present, but only as a mere rudiment. This group (paracephalus, pseudacephalus) is immediately allied to the acephali, and similar observations apply to it. Plates of this somewhat rare form are given in Gurlt, op. cit. PI. i. fig. 4. and in Geoifroy St. Hilaire, PI. xi., who (vol. ii. p. 437, &c.) has also given the literature of the subject. He separates this group into three species: 1. Paracephulus, with malformed, but voluminous head ; face distinct, with mouth, and rudimentary' organs of sense ; the upj>er extremities present. 2. Omacephalus, with the head as in the preceding class, but the upper extremities absent. 3. llcmiacephalus, * From Tfjptif, deficient.

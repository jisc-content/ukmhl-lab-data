DROPSIES. 50 that the fluid of serous dropsy is derived from the blood, the reasons in favour of the fibrinous fluid arising from the same source are even stronger; for it so very closely resembles the plasma of the blood, that in many cases no difference whatever can be detected, and, indeed, we can imitate the fibrinous fluid by quickly filtering frogâ€™s blood through fine tissue paper. Hence, we are led to the view that, in this case, even more decidedly than in the serous form, theie is a purely mechanical permeation of the plasma through the walls of the vessels. We must not, however, forget that the fluid sometimes appears more dilute, and, as a general rule, contains rather less fibrin and albumen than the plasma of the blood. Hence, in such cases, as we have already seen, endosmotic action is called into play, only to a less degree than in serous dropsy. Since the serous, and also the fibrinous fluids, take their origin from the blood, and are pro- duced by the permeation of its fluid constituents through the walls of the vessels, how is it that in some cases we have one, and in others, the other form of effusion ? In the present state of our knowledge, this question cannot be satisfactorily answered ; there is, however, every probability that it admits of this solution: namely, that serous dropsy, as we have already stated, owes its origin to a permeation of the fluid of the blood through the walls of the veins, while fibrinous dropsy arises from a similar permeation through the walls of the capillary system. In favour of this view may be urged: firstly, the different properties of the walls of these two divisions of the vascular system. The veins have thick walls, consisting o several layers of cells and fibres, while the walls of the capillaries are very thin and delicate. It is true, t lat we cannot accurately estimate the differences m their endosmotic properties, hut from analogy ffrom all the experiments hat have been made in this department), we may conclude t a the product of endosmosis, in the former case, is more dilute and poorer in solid constituents; and that in the atter, 1

271 TYPHUS DEPOSITS. Their common termination is the softening of the deposited mass. The period which elapses between the deposition and : softening is very different in individual cases; it may vary from a fewT days or weeks to several months. In general the softening extends to the enclosed normal tissues, and the united product opens for itself a passage, and is discharged externally. An ulcer is thus formed: this either spreads by continuance of the original process (new deposition with softening) in the surrounding parts, until it terminates in death ; or the ulcer heals by cicatrization, whilst the loss of substance is repaired by permanently organised epigeneses. In other cases the softened mass does not become discharged but is gradually resorbed, and the loss of substance is repaired by a similar cicatrization to that which occurs in the preceding case. Sometimes the reparation is interrupted by the deposition, instead of softening, becoming converted into an earthy or cretaceous mass, and thus forming a con- cretion. The separate forms of these epigeneses have generally been distinguished less by histological and anatomical chiiracters than according to the true or pretended peculiarities of the morbid processes with which they are usually associated. 1 shall follow this classification as it has the most special rela- tion to practical medicine. DEPOSITIONS IN TYPHUS. In the majority of the cases of typhus, pathological epige- neses occur in different parts of the body, most frequently in the intestinal canal between the mucous membrane and the muscular coat, in Peyerâ€™s glands, (especially at the termination of the small intestines) and in the mesenteric glands: less frequently in the spleen and lungs, and in and under the mucous mem- brane of the trachea. These formations usually appear as a more or less firm lardaceous mass of a yellowish or whitish colour, which is deposited in greater or less abundance,

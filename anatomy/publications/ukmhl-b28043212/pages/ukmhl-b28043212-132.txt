112 pathological epigeneses. If after the above observations it hardly can be doubted that the capacity for development is inherent in the cytoblastema, and that the actual development is modified by exter- nal influences; the important question still remains what share the cytoblastema has in the development, and what share is due to external influences? Taking a general view of the question, we find considerable differences on this point. In the formation of the animal organism from the egg, the share of the cytoblastema is very predominating; there is contained within it not merely the capacity, but likewise the whole quality of the future formation : in fact, the whole of the future organism is included in the egg: external circum- stances can hinder, but cannot essentially change it. When speaking of the theory of malformations, we shall consider this subject more closely. In the nutrition of the perfect organism, the case is different; we here observe the various tissues of the different organs evolved from the blood, or rather from the general nutritive fluid, â€” as cellular tissue, bone, muscle, and nerves. The element of this diffe- rence cannot therefore lie in the blastema; it must 1 atlier be sought in the ready-formed parts of the body, which influence the blastema to the development of parts similar to themselves. We must accordingly conclude that the forma- tive capacity, which being equally diffused through the egg is impressed on the whole blastema, now acts at special points, and on those individual tissues which have the capabi- lity of exciting a development in a suitable blastema, leading to the formation of analogous compounds within its sphere of action, that is, in its immediate neighbourhood. This is a formative act similar to that by which an entire organism enables a cytoblastema to develop an individual similar to itself. The nature of the blastema is not, however, to be regarded as a matter of indifference in this process; it can generally only be traced in the development, when it possesses a definite chemical composition, and on this, as well as on

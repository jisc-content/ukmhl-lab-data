13 INTRODUCTION. It is, therefore, much to be desired that experiments pro- ducing morbid changes in animals should be more frequently instituted ; for it is only from a large number of similar experiments, not from isolated cases, that conclusions can be safely drawn. The adoption of the experimental method in pathological anatomy promises farther advantages; for, by its application, the fruitful labours of that science will cease to remain the exclusive property of the practical physician, who, from his usual occupations, or possibly from his ignorance of the means of carrying out microscopic and chemical investigation, frequently fails to draw from the cases that come under his eye such useful observations as might have profited himself and his science. The materials thus gained by observation and experiment must be used with the greatest care, if science is in reality to be advanced by them. This care must, in the first place, extend to description ; the object of which is to give to others a correct and intuitive conception of the changes that have been observed; hence definite terms must be used, whose in- terpretation can admit of no mistake. Care must also be taken to describe in like manner all the relations which admit of an exact notice, as number, size, and weight. This must only be omitted in cases where it is obviously unnecessary, and general information will suffice. What these cases are, must be left to the judgment of the describer, who must, therefore, always clearly understand, in every case that he examines anil describes, what are the essential points requiring an exact description, and what, on the contrary, do not require, or even admit of particular notice.* In the next place, it is the object of pathological anatomy to examine the various changes occurring in the different parts of * On these points the reader may consult with advantage the recent Treatise by Engel; Propadeutik der pathologischen Anatomic.

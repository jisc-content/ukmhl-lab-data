386 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 1. Concrement in the muscles of the thigh of a man, analysed by Lassaigne, (L. Gmelin, n. 2, 1367). 2. Annular ossification of the tricuspid valve, (Walehner, ditto). 3. Pulmonary concretion analysed by Henry, (L. Gmelin, ii. 2, 1370). In the above cases the earthy salts predominate: whether there exist concretions in which, as Boudet supposes, the soluble (namely the soda) salts form the principal ingredient, must still remain questionable. There are still two kinds of concretions occurring in the parenchyma of organs, presenting distinct chemical characters : 1. The depositions of cholesterin which are of tolerably frequent occurrence in the arterial tissue of aged persons.* The diagnosis of these depositions is very easy, being based on their seat (the arterial walls) and on the well-known microscopical and chemical characters of cholesterin. Their formation is probably dependant on a great excess of cholesterin and serolin in the blood, but the causes are not by any means obvious, why this fat is only deposited in particular spots of the body and of the arteries, instead of being equably distributed. Moreover these fatty deposits sometimes occur in other parts besides the arteries, as for instance in obsolete tubercle. 2. Concretions consisting principally of urate of soda (sometimes with a little urate of lime) are deposited in the neighbourhood of the joints and sometimes in their interior, in the areolar tissue, and in the tendons of gouty persons. They occur as earthy masses of indefinite form and size, are very light and porous, and of a yellowish white colour: they are smooth to the touch, and may be readily scraped by the knife. 1 lie following analyses will serve to give an idea of their chemical compo- sition : 1 2 3 Water. .... 8.3 10.3 (2.00) Animal matter (areolar tissue yielding gelatin). . 16.7 19.5 10.34 Uric acid. .... 16.7 20.0 59.43 Soda. . . . . 16.7 20.0 15.09 Lime. . . • • 8.3 10.0 8.25 Chloride of sodium. 16.7 18.0 5.60 Chloride of potassium. — 2.2 Loss. . 16.6 — 1.29 100.0 100.0 100.00 The first analysis is by Laugier, the second by Wurzer (see Berzelius s Thierchemie, p. 723), and the third by H.

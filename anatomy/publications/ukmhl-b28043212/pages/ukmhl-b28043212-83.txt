PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. 63 phere. In the normal state, the serum is colourless, but it frequently exhibits a brownish green, or yellow tint. This yellow, yellowish green, or brown colour of the serum, may depend on two distinct causes. 1. On bile-pigment.—In this case on treating the serum with nitric acid, the well-known changes of colour are pro- duced : a little acid renders the serum green; a larger quan- tity, blue, purple, violet, and lastly of a dull red or yellow colour. This reaction is, however, usually somewhat modi- fied by the presence of the albumen of the serum, which is precipitated by the acid, and subsequently assumes a yellow tint, which conceals or modifies that of the altered bile-pigment. A large amount of this pigment is always present in cases of jaundice, when not merely the blood, but also the other fluids and secretions, and even the parenchyma of the different organs become of a yellow tint. This may, however, occur without jaundice in persons apparently healthy. I have seen a large amount of bile-pigment in the serum of an old man, who was not jaundiced, in whose case venesection was ordered in consequence of apoplectic symptoms, and a smaller, but still very considerable quantity in the serum of a man with arachnitis. 2. The yellowish green or brown tint of the serum may be dependant on the brown colouring matter of healthy blood, which was first described by Simon, and received the name of hannaphatin from that chemist.* Nitric acid will serve to prevent its being mistaken for bile-pigment. The, serum which in a normal state ought to be clear, is sometimes opaque and of a milk-white appearance. This may depend ou various causes. Firstly, on a large number of microscopic fat-vesicles. Secondly, on the presence of a considerable quantity of minute granules of coagulated fibrin, * For a description of hsemaphaein, see Simon’s Animal Chemistry, vol. i. p. 42.

433 SARCINA VENTRICULI. sides appear indented, and the angles rounded off. Each plate appears divided into four squares (secondary squares), by two bands intersecting at right angles in the centre ; each of these four squares subdivides in a similar manner, into four ternary squares; and each of these sixteen ternary squares appears with stronger powers composed of four squares which are in immediate contact.* The cells are of a brown colour, and their interstices are transparent. Iodine communicates to the sarcina a dark yellow or brown colour; alcohol renders it somewhat shrivelled; it is not destroyed by boiling nitric acid. It propagates by division. Nothing is at present known with certainty respecting its primary origin, and its pathological indications. The sarcina was discovered by Goodsir in a fluid vomited at regular intervals by a man ; the fluid was in a state of fermentation, and accord- ing to Wilsonâ€™s analysis contained, besides some hydrochloric and lactic acids, a very large quantity of acetic aeid.f It has siuce been observed in three cases by Busk. J Whether we place the sarcina with the genus gonium in the animal kingdom, or whether we regard it as a vegetable, it most probably, like the yeast plant, stands in the most intimate relation with chemical decomposition (phenomena of fermentation), occurring in the stomach. Although it has l>een hitherto found only in the stomach, yet its germs may have penetrated from without. II. PARASITIC FUNGI ON TUB HUMAN INTEGUMENT AND ITS APPENDAGES. Fungi of this nature have, during the last few years, been frequently observed in the human subject, and fresh observa- tions are being continually made. As a general rule pre- senting but few exceptions, they appear incapable of being developed immediately on the epidermis, or on the epithe- * See Plate x. fig. 11. f Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, 1842, vol. lvii. p. 430, et seq. with figures. | Microscopic Journal, January, 1843.

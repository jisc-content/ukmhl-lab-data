FATIIOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 330 THIRD FORM. COMBINATION OF MELANOSIS AND CANCER. Melanotic Cancer. Synon. Cancer melanodes ; carcinoma melanodes.* We have already had occasion to mention that dark granu- lar pigment may occur as an incidental constituent of cance- rous tumours. This pigment is either enclosed in cells, which are only slightly, or not at all different externally from the ordinary cancer-cells (true melanosis), or it occurs in the form of free granules, and then sometimes consists of sulphuret of iron. Hence we have here the same differences as we for- merly noticed in our remarks on melanosis. The characters of melanotic cancer vary with the quantity and arrangement of the black pigment. When a small number of pigment-elements (cells or granules) are equally distributed over a large amount of cancerous structure, the tumour presents a gray colour. If an excess of pigment is deposited at special points, the cancer presents a dark speckled or marbled appearance. Finally if the amount of pigment is very excessive, the cancer presents throughout a blackish brown colour, and resembles in its appearance a true melanotic tumour. Melanosis is associated both with ence- phaloid and scirrhus; the former, according to my own expe- rience, being combined with true, the latter with false mela- nosis. In its progress and relations melanotic cancer presents no especial peculiarities. FOURTH FORM. GELATINOUS CANCER, OR COLLOID. Synon. Cancer alveolaris ; carcinoma alveolare ; cancer ar6olaire ; cancer gelatimforme.f We have previously described the viscid fluid, which forms * See Muller, op. cit. p. 18, or West’s translation, p. 55; Hannover, op. cit. p. 32. f Sec Muller, op. cit. p. 1C, or West’s translation, p. 50; Hanno-

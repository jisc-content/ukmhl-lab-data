PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 340 nation which renders it soluble, and whose gradual decompo- sition gives rise to its separation in a crystalline state. Cholesterin separates in large masses during the period of old age; and, in this point of view, the statement of Becquerel and Rodier,* that from the 40â€”50th year the amount of cholesterin increases in the blood of both sexes is very inte- resting. The augmentation of this substance in the blood is probably connected with an increased separation of it in the various parts of the body. A similar increase may, how- ever, take place in young persons in consequence of a morbid process. b. Margarin and margaric acid. These are crystallizable, forming very characteristic shapes, similar in both cases. They form microscopic needles w7hich rarely occur alone, hut usually in stellar or tuft-like groups.f They are most com- monly devoid of colour, but sometimes, when occurring in large masses, appear of a dark browmish tint, when viewed by refracted light. The crystals both of margarin and margaric acid are insoluble in water and in acids, but dissolve readily in ether and hot alcohol, and, after prolonged ebullition, in the caustic alkalies. . Crystals of margaric acid may be distinguished chemica y from those of margarin, by the circumstance that the former dissolve when boiled in weak spirit, while the latter require strong alcohol for their solution. The formation of crystals of margarin may be explained in the following manner. * Human fat, as it occurs in adipose tissue, consists of an admixture of olein and margarin m indefinite and extremely varying proportions. The margarin, which at the ordinary temperature of the body is solid, is held in solution in the fluid olein, which naturally has a greater solvent power at a high than at a low temperature. Naw, when this fat at the temperature of the human body is neai y * Comptes rendus, 1844, n. p. 1083. f Plate x. fig. 3.

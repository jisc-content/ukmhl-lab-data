554 EXPLANATION OK THE PLATES. PLATE VI. TUBERCLE ENCEFHALOID TYPHOUS MATTER. Fig. 1. Exhibits tubercles from different organs, in various stages of development. Fig. 1. Aâ€”C. Tubercles from the lungs of a young man, who died of Tuberculosis pulmonum. A and B are nuclei in an amorphous cytoblastema; most of these nuclei contain nucleoli. At C the cytoblastema has disappeared, and the cells are in contact with each other. The cytoblastema as well as the nuclei were soluble in ammonia. Fig. 1. D. Tubercular cells from the lungs of another young man, who died from the same malady. Here the cytoblastema has also disappeared, and the nuclei are enclosed in a cell-wall; no nucleoli are present. 1 he cell-\\ all gradually dissolved in acetic acid, the nuclei remaining un- changed. The lungs of both subjects contained, besides the true tuberculous cells, also many granular cells; those of the first-named subject presented many vomicae, which contained softened tubercular matter, as shewn in Fig. 6 of this Plate. Magnified 220 diameters. Fig. 2. Tubercles from the lungs of another young man. Magnified 220 diameters. A. Nuclei, for the most part with nucleoli, in an amorphous cyto- blastema. B. Perfect tubercular cells with a cell-wall, nucleus, and nucleoli; the former was soluble in acetic acid, which produced no effect on the latter constituents. C. Separate cells, with granular contents. D. Larger cells, frequently occurring in tubercle. Fig. 3. and 4. Tubercles from the kidneys and lung of a young

134 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. as epithelium cells which have been rubbed off and formed a sort of emulsion with a fluid, have often trom their purulent appearance and from the omission of accurate observation, been mistaken for pus. Hence the necessity for dividing fluids which appear purulent into true genuine pus, and into spurious or false pus. But even true pus presents many differences in the form and properties of its corpuscles, in the proportions of the corpuscles to the fluid portion, &c. Hence genuine pus must be divided into many varieties, which it is necessary that we should know and be able to distinguish, if we hope to have a clear understanding of the variations presented by the process of suppuration in different cases. 1. TRUE GENUINE PUS. Normal pus (pus bonum et laudabile) is that which is yielded by healtliy-looking wounds healing by suppuration, and by mature abscesses. This is the best adapted tor show- ing the properties of perfectly formed pus as well as the mode in which it is produced. Normal pus forms a creamy, thick, opaque and homoge- neous fluid, containing no flocculent matter, depositing on standing no caseous, grumous precipitate, and communi- cating a soft and fatty feeling when rubbed between the fingers. It has a faint yellow, and sometimes a white or faintly green tint, and develops, as long as it remains warm, a peculiar, mawkish animal odour, which it loses on cooling. It is somewhat sweet, and insipid, and has a specific gravity of 1030—1033. Normal pus consists essentially of two distinct parts, or very minute organized particles—the pus-corpuscles, and of a colourless aqueous fluid—the serum or liquor puns m which the pus-corpuscles are suspended as in an emulsion. The pus-corpuscles are quite invisible to the naked eye, and we can only begin to distinguish them by a magnifying

107 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. Uesterm in gall-stones), andean also enter as constituents into organized formations, but can never of themselves alone, or in combination with salts and extractive matters, act as cvto- blastemata; at least, up to the present time nothing of the ..sort has been observed. Hence there remain, as the actual and potential constituents of the blastema, only the protein- compounds ; although these are never found alone in the tbodv, being always associated with the above named substances, i Further, all these protein-compounds are not susceptible of development. Fluids which merely contain dissolved albumen and the above substances never appear to act as cvtoblastcmata. In the common dropsical effusions, which are always rich in albumen, we never observe any organized products, unless fibrin be also present: this is at least the result of my own observations, which have been very : numerous, and 1 am not acquainted with a single exception i to the law.# Moreover, fluids in which casein is the only protein-compound, cannot, as far as observation has yet shown us, act as blastemata. In the milk, for instance, as long as it contains merely casein, we never observe any patho- logical formations, for the granular bodies belong to the nor- mal process of development of the milk ; as soon, however, as any fibrin is present, morbid products, such as pas-corpus- cles, may be formed in it. On the other hand, in all fluids which we regard as cytoblastemata for morbid products, fibrin has always been found: hence we must regard it as the necessary and apparently the most essential ingredient in the cytoblastema. This law respecting the necessity for the occurrence ot fibrin in the cytoblastemata of morbid products, which 1 have seen to hold good in several hundred cases, without a single exception, is not at all in accordance with the course of normal development: thus the egg, the proto- type of all formative fluids, contains no fibrin ; its place being * See the section on serous dropsy.

CYSTICKRCUS CELLULOSA. 471 in other districts, where the taenia prevails, we may be assured that the patient is a native of one of the above-named countries, or at least lias caught it there. With respect to its origin and pathological importance, there is nothing to add beyond what has been stated of the taenia vulgaris. See representations in Breraser, PI. n. See also the. very interesting paper by 1). F. Eschricht, anat. phvsiol. Untersuchungen iiber die Both- riocephalen, (Nova acta acad. Caes. Leop. vol. xix. suppl. 2), which also contains some general remarks well worthy of consideration, against the view of the spontaneous origin of intestinal worms. FOURTH ORDER. CTSTICA. 1. The cysticercus cellulosa, (hydatis finna, Blumenb.) consists ot an oval vesicle varying in length from three to eight lines: it possesses an extensible neck, terminating iu a head, which together with the neck can lie protruded and retracted, and in the latter case may be entirely over- looked by a superficial observer. The head when protruded is quadrangular, and has, at each of its four comers, a sucker ; on the tore part ot the head, situated at the base of a conical proboscis, is a double circle of hooks, amounting in number to about thirty-two. Extended to its full length the animal may measure from half an inch to an inch; its breadth at the cephalic extremity amounts to about one line; at the vesicular portion, to about six lines. As in the case of the trichina, this worm is found in the muscles ot the human subjectâ€”most frequently in the psoas, the glutxvi, iliacus interims, the extensors of the thigh, and in the heart; also, however, in the cellular tissue, in the brain and pia mater, and sometimes, but very rarely in the eye. We sometimes observe a solitary worm ; sometimes they occur in great numbers. It is almost invariably, at least when occurring in parenchymatous parts, surrounded by an enclosed capsule, which, however, is not essential to it, but

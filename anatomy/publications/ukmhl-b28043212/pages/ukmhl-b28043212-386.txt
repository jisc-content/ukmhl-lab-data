Berzelius. 2. Vauquelin and Laugier.* Denisf has examined the brown fur of the tongue in cases of deranged digestion, after it had been scraped off with an ivory knife and dried. : It then formed a firm, translucent, yellowish gray mass, which con- \ tained no crystals. Its chemical composition was as follows : Phosphate of lime. Carbonate of lime. Altered mucus (epithelium, &c.) . Loss. . The sordes attached to the teeth of the same person were simi- larly composed. If, therefore, we except the fact that the depositions on the tongue must contain many more epithelial cells than the tartar of the teeth, there is a striking resemblance in the chemical composition of both, and it appears clear that they must originate from the same ■ causes. According to Mandl, the formation of tartar is in no way con- nected with the increased quantity of lime in the saliva, but produced by the skeletons of dead infusoria, agreeing in form with those of the vibriones which deposit themselves in viscid matter, and between the teeth, and thus form concretions. This view appears to me to be wholly 34.7 8.7 50.0 6.6 100 0 * Berzehus, Thierchemie, 4th edit. p. 228. t L. Gmelin, n. 2, 1397.

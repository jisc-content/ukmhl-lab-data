REPARATION CICATRICES—TUMOURS. 131 -system; or else it is transitory, and after a time softens, breaks up, and is removed. This is the leading difference between non-malignant and i malignant epigeneses. Further, morbid epigeneses may be classified: 1. Into such as form a reparation of a lost part (regenera- ition). These regenerated parts are either : a. Perfectly formed, the newly constructed part being I (similar to that which was lost, both in its morphological, chemical, and functional characters (true reparation). This ; i true regeneration always follows the law ot analogous forma- tion, and in the human body is confined to simple tissues; : i in the lower animals it exists on a much more extensive scale. b. Or they are imperfectly formed (cicatrices). Cicatrices are sometimes transitory, existing only so long as the morbid product is continuing to be developed. When it is completed, the new tissue is perfectly similar to the old, and the cicatrix: disappears. In other cases the cicatrix is persistent. The new parts then remain undeveloped and half-amorphous, or they I are composed of elements of lower physiological importance, as of areolar tissue, while the complicated elements of the lost part, as it normally existed, (nerves, muscular fibres, glands, &c.) cither do not occur at all, or at any rate much more sparingly than before: hence the new part can only im- perfectly fulfil the functions of its predecessor. 2. Into tissues whose elements are not reparative, but directly increase the bulk of previously normal organs. Hyper- trophies—tumours. These may be distinguished by observing that in cases of hypertrophy, the newly formed parts are continuous with those previously existing, and cannot be anatomically distinguished from them. Hypertrophy may thus, in the same way as regeneration and on the same grounds, be divided into the true and perfect, or the false and imperfect. K 2

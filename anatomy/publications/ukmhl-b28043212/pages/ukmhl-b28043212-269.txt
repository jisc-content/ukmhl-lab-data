This tumour enclosed in its inner layers much fluid mercury.* Dalrymplet has given a brief description of an ossified encysted tumour (». e. one impregnated with calcareous salts). The encysted tumour was situated lxmeath the tarsal cartilage of the upper eyelid in a middle aged man; instead of the usual caseous matter, it contained an earthy or osseous deposition. Tins tumour was rather larger than a pea and consisted of a hard earthy substance arranged into concentric layers, •which under the microscope were seen to be entirely composed of firmly agglutinated epithelial cells; instead, however, of forming transparent, thin scales with a central nucleus, they were thick and hard, and contained granular, earthy molecules which dissolved in dilute hydro- chloric acid. Between the cells there was no amorphous earthy deposit, but the whole consisted of epithelial cells winch were opaque, of light brown colour, with a distinct large central nucleus. The deposition con- sisted, according to Gulliver, chiefly of phosphate of lime with a trace of car- bonate of lime. The above cited chemical analyses very distinctly show the gradual increase of the calcareous salts as ossification progresses. In my * Leop. Gmelin, Chemie, u. 2. p. 1373. t I/ondon Med. Gaz.

256 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. in such a manner, that it cannot escape, but irritates the surrounding parts, and gives rise to exudation, it becomes surrounded by a capsule of coagulated fibrin, which gradually organises itself in granulations, and at length is converted into a membrane resembling mucous membrane or cutis, and becomes furnished with an epitheliumâ€”a proceeding fre- quently observed in fistuke, &c. At first the original contents are still present; they are, however, gradually resorbed, and give place to the secreted product of the newly formed sac- membrane, which always becomes further organised. In this way probably extravasations of blood, accumulations of pus, &c., which have no tendency to external rejection, may become the cause of encysted tumours. The origin of such tumours can frequently be attributed to external influences, contusions, &c., but more especially, continued pressure upon one spot: they may also arise, however, from constitutional, and internal causes acting in an insensible manner. The following example appears to me to contribute to the confirmation of this view of their mode of origin. A parrot in confinement died with a scrofulous deposit which had destroyed the skin by ulceration, and had caused caries of the cranial bones, &c. Upon dissection, the cavity of the abdomen appeared almost completely filled with a clear reddish fluid, which upon evacuation, spontaneously coagulated and characterized itself as fibrinous dropsy. In the neck were found after the removal of the skin two tumours of the size of walnuts, which from external appearance must have been regarded as glandular enlargements, but upon dissection presented peculiar characters. They both formed imperfect encysted tumours: their rather thick sac was formed of the substance of the hypertrophied distended gland, and upon its inner surface were numerous highly vascular granulations, covered with epithelium; the contents formed a soft mass, which presented some irregular pus-corpuscles, but foi the most part consisted of cells, perfectly similar to the epitheli

PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 168 EPIGENESES OF THE ELEMENTARY TISSUES. Imperfectly organized structures. In dissections, it very frequently happens that solid epige- neses are found, which without belonging to the class of con- cretions, yet examined by the microscope offer no trace of organization. They are designated according to circumstances by various names, as solid exudation, coagulated lymph, fresh pseudo-membrane, and so forth. They are characterised by the fact, that under the microscope they appear perfectly amorphous ;* and when treated with acetic acid, ammonia, or potash, they become paler and more transparent, until at length, in some cases, they entirely disappear. In many cases they are mixed with granular elements—vesicles and granules of fat—which when treated with ether disappear; or with protein- compounds in a granular state—elementary granules in which no decided cellular formation can be discerned.! This gra- nular appearance usually remains unchanged after the applica- tion of the above-named reagents. Solid epigeneses of this kind sometimes cover the surfaces of internal organs, as for instance of those parts which are invested with serous mem- branes, and sometimes they are deposited in the parenchyma, thickening the elementary textures, and thus giving rise to imperfect hypertrophies or tumours. They always exhibit a lardaceous appearance. Chemically they re-act like coagulated protein-compounds (fibrin) with a certain amount of fat, and more or less saturated with serum. They always arise from fibrinous dropsy, of which the fibrin has coagulated, and are to be regarded as solid cytoblastemata, whose further develop- ment was interrupted by the death of the organ which was attacked. Had the vitality of the organ been prolonged, they would, according to circumstances, have been changed * Plate ii. fig. 2. t Plate ii. fig. 3 and 5.

3S9 CONCRETIONS IN THE PARENCHYMA. Almost all exudations may, under certain conditions, pass into concretions, as in the lymphatic glands, the kidneys, the spleen, the lungs, the areolar tissue, apoplectic sacs in the brain, scrophulous depositions, tubercles, &e. The con- ditions governing these transitions are not clear, but the fol- lowing may be provisionally indicated : 1. Great abundance of cdcareous salts in the primary exudations, as appears to prevail in arthritic j)ersons. 2. Subsequent separation of calcareous salts, &c., in the manner mentioned in p. 384, at a period when the exudation predominates, and is either in the act of development or absorption. The insoluble earthy salts remain in both cases, while the protein-compounds are either entirely or parti;dly developed, or dissolved and resorbed. The relation that these concretions bear to true osseous formations, deserves especial attention. As a rule they have, as we have already mentioned, no resemblance to true bone, and the term ossifi- cation is therefore very unsuitable and liable to be misunder- stood ; still there appear to be cases in which these concretions occasionally reach a higher degree of organization, and thus form transitions to new formations of true bony substance.* The mode of transition is, however, little known, and requires more accurate examination. Of the works treating especially of concretions, the following, besides those to which we have already referred, deserve mention: John, che- mische Tabellen des Thierreiches, p. 60 ; Duncan, jun., Edinburgh ined. and surgical Journal, voi. i. p. 407 ; J. F. Meckel, pathol. Anat. n. 2, Gurlt medicin. Vereinszeitung, 1833, No. 31 ; Gluge, niikro.sk. Outers. Part 1, p. IK), &c.; Henle, allgem. Anatomie, p. 7, &c. ; Hcmak, Casper's Wochenschrift, 1842, p. 1, &c. * See Valentin in his Repertorium, 1836, p. 317, &c.

PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 332 tain is known. Muller believes that its gradual enlargement is dependant on a further development and increase of the cells containing the jelly ; young cells being formed within the parent-cells. Colloid, in its characteristic form, most commonly occurs in the intestinal canal between the stomach and the rectum, from whence it proceeds to the peritoneum—especially the omentum ; it more rarely occurs in other organs—in the breast bones, &c. The external characters of this form of cancer are so very striking, that no one who has once seen a case, or even a good plate of it, can well err in his diagnosis. The peculiar interstices formed by the fibrous meshes and filled with jelly, present no variation, at least in cases of fully developed colloid. When colloid presents transitions into other forms of cancer, as, for instance, when the jelly is not enclosed in its proper inter- stices, but is deposited free between the fibrous structures and the cells, the diagnosis can only be established by micro- chemical examination, and there is a difficulty in assigning to the tumour its proper place in the scale of cancerous forma- tions. The reader will find a description of several cases of colloid, with plates, in the chapter on the morbid anatomy of the stomach and intes- tinal canal, in the second volume. Many forms of tumour which have received special names from morbid anatomists and surgeons, do not, in a histolo- gical point of view, merit such a distinction. To this class belong polypi and fungoid growths. The former have only this in common—that they arise from, or are invested with mucous membrane. But if every epigenesis invested with mucous membrane, and developed in or under such a membrane, be termed a polypus, it is obvious that there may be great differences in the histological arrangement of such a

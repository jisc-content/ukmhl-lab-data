PARASITES. 456 in Upper Egypt and Abyssinia, but especially in the Dutch and English possessions of Guinea, where it is so prevalent that it has received the name of guinea-ivorm; it likewise occurs in some districts of the West Indies and of America, and upon the island of Curacoa (where it was probably intro- duced by negroes). It exists in the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the human subject, most frequently upon the extremities, especially the inferior; but it occasionally occurs in the scrotum and other parts of the body. A man has sometimes only one, sometimes several (4, 5, 6â€”15) worms at the same time. The symptoms which accompany the presence of this parasite in the human subject are very various, being some- times unimportant, while they are sometimes so violent that a dangerous disease, or even death itself results. These are diminished, or totally disappear, if the worm is removed by cautious extraction. If it should be ruptured during the process, the masses of young contained in its interior are discharged into the wound, and occasion unhealthy sup- puration. Although some celebrated authors are of opinion that these worms are spontaneously developed, yet it appears to me for more probable that they have passed into the body from without; either from the stomach or intestinal canal, into which the almost microscopic young have been introduced with water, or, which is more probable, that they have made their way into the body through the integument, and have there further developed themselves. The worm may, appa- rently, dwell for a long time in the body without being remarked, and not excite attention until after its perfect development, when it becomes filled with young, wdiieh quit the parent animal, and by their great number, and active movements, excite irritation in the surrounding parts; or until it spontaneously endeavours to quit the body in order to deposit its young externally. This slow process of develop- ment also explains those cases in which the disease has broken out in persons who had quitted, eight or even twelve

89 PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. dilatation of the capillaries, of the aggregation of blood- corpuscles in them, and of the effusion of serous or fibrinous fluid from them, are in both cases the same, and the patho- logist is unable to draw any certain distinction between them. The further course, and the combinations of local hvper- | aernia are very numerous, for it is usually associated with , the effusion of serous or fibrinous fluid, and frequently with rupture of the vessels and extravasation of blood. Its termi- j nations are : 1, disappearance of the hypenemia by the disper- j sion of the impeded corpuscles, and the re-contraction of the vessels; 2, the occurrence of decomposition of the blood, in which case the hiematin dissolves in the serum; 3, or of gan- grene, in which case the whole of the blood undergoes a chemical change. Of this we shall speak presently. As we have load hypenemia, so likewise is there load anaemia. It may l>e recognized by the affected part being paler than usual, and by the effusion of very little blood on making an incision. Its causes are: 1, a constriction or occlusion of the arteries supplying the part ; or 2, a contrac- tion of the capillaries dependant on the nervous system, as, for instance, in sudden pallor of the cheeks, &c. 3. KXTBAVABATION of blood. It frequently happens that, in consequence of laceration of the vessels, the blood escapes from them and is effused in the cavities of the hotly or in the parenchyma of the organs, between the histologic elements. The process is termed hemorrhage, and the blood itself is said to be extravasated. The effused blood may either coagulate or remain fluid. Generally, we only find it coagulated when it has been effused in large quantity,â€”as after wounds, in severe apo- plectic attacks, and in pulmonary and bronchial haemorrhage. The coagulation, as in ordinary cases, depends on the solidi- fication of the fibrin, and the clot is composed of that con-

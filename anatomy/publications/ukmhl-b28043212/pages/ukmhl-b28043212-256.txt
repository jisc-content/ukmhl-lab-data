PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 236 as still quite unknown. A portion of a melanotic tumour of the brain analysed by A. Vogel, jun. yielded :* Carbon • . 49.885 Hydrogen • 7.156 Nitrogen • 23.784 Oxygen ■ 19.175 100.000 This analysis differs very considerably from that given in page 192 of the colouring matter from melanotic lungs. In that case, how- ever, the histological examination was totally neglected, and there- fore we cannot now precisely determine what was analysed, so that unfortunately it is of no value to pathological anatomy. SEVENTH GROUP. TUMOURS CONTAINING A GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE. Gelatinous Tumours. In many tumours there occurs a viscid, gelatinous sub- stance, partly infiltrated amongst the other firm elementary tissues, and partly contained in appropriate spaces or cavities, sometimes in such abundance and so greatly exceeding the other elements, that the tumours may, with great propriety, be termed gelatinous. The elements co-existing with the gelatin in these tumours are of very various kinds, generally fibres, vessels, and sometimes even cartilaginous tissue, so that these tumours mav be considered combinations of the •/ fibrous tumour, enchondroma and encysted tumour; even cancer-cells occur conjointly with this gelatin, and the most frequent form of gelatinous tumour is the so named gelatinous cancer (colloid). This substance is always transparent and colourless, some- times fluid, resembling thick mucus, at other times firmer like half softened jelly. Under the microscope it appears * Miinchner gelehrte Anzeigcn, 1844, No. 143, p. 108, &c.

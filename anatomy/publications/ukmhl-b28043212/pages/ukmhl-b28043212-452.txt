PARASITES. 432 more developed forms of the favus plant. In all these cases the fungi undoubtedly did not develop themselves till after the evacuation of the urine, and then probably from an espe- cial condition of the secretion presenting to them a genial soil for their growth. Fungi are probably not unfrequent in the fluids of the intestinal canal, but they readily escape observation when they occur singly, and form minute isolated cells. Cases of this kind are specified and described by Bohm * Henle.f myself, Gruby.t and others. There are two totally different classes of cases, between which we must discriminate : 1. Those in which the whole of the yeast plants have been conveyed into the body with fermenting drinks, and have there undergone no fur- ther change, but have only passed through it (as in cases described by Bohm and Henle). 2. Those in which the fungi, their single spores having probably pe- netrated unobscrvedly into the body, have become further developed and multiplied, in consequence of a special morbid disposition (by the formation of lactic acid, (?) and perhaps also of acetic acid (?), cases of which have been observed by myself and Gruby). The latter cases alone have a pathological signification. 2. Sarcina ventriculi, Goodsir. This parasite has been hitherto found in only a few instances, and never except in vomited fluids. In its entire habitus it is allied to the species gonium, which although placed by Ehrenbcrg amongst the infusoria, is, however, probably a plant The sarcina forms quadrangular or ohlong plates varying in diameter from the 100th to the 120th of a line. The thickness of the plates amounts to about the eighth o their diameter. Under low powers the sides appeal' straight and the angles sharply defined, but under higher powers, the * Die kranke Darmschleimhaut in der asiatischen Cholera, Berlin, 1828, p. 57. t Patholog.

12 INTRODUCTION. gists, rather than by mere anatomists; but we must be very careful in tracing the connexion which subsists between the symptoms observed during life, and the changes noticed after death. Hypotheses, which can be as little avoided in patholo- gical anatomy as in medicine generally, must be most carefully checked, and their actual value borne in mind; they must not be ranked with ascertained facts and theories, if we wish to see our science preserve its positive character and its objective position high above the troubled flood of medical systems; and if we would protect it from the contempt with which cer- tain physicians are inclined to regard it. The other mode by which pathological anatomy gains new facts is by experiment. Experiments instituted on animals, and, in certain cases, on man, with the view of arti- ficially producing a morbid condition, and then carefully studying it, afford most valuable aid; for here the quality and quantity of the causes in action are much more under control than in ordinary cases of disease. By these means, the actual causes and consequences of indi- vidual pathological changes can be much better studied than in cases when they arise of themselves, and where their causes are frequently either entirely concealed, or can only be followed in doubt and obscurity through a multitude of influences, whose origin cannot be traced with certainty, or even proba- bility. We sometimes hear it objected, that from pathological changes observed in the lower animals, no certain conclusions can be drawn as applicable to man. This objection has, how- ever, long been refuted by experience, which shows that, bearing in mind the differences necessarily consequent on variety of structure, such conclusions are not only admissible, but that comparative pathology and pathological anatomy afford as much assistance in the prosecution of this science in relation to man, as comparative anatomy does for the thorough comprehension of human anatomy and physiology.

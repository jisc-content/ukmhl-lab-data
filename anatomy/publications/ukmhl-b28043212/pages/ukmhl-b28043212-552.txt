POST MORTEM CHANGES. 532 part, have been already described in their appropriate sections, as evolution of gas and softening in different parts of the body, increase of volume of certain parts from gaseous dis- tension or infiltration of fluids, changes of colour indepen- dent of the above mentioned imbibition of hfematin, namely pseudo-melanosis from decomposition of haematin or the formation of sulphuret of iron, and green colorations de- pending partly on imbibition of the colouring matter of the bile, and partly upon other unknown causes active in pu- trefaction. . , We must also here include the rigor mortis, or death- stiffening, which. as the animal heat disappears, invades a contractile parts of the body—the muscles of voluntary and involuntary motion, fibrous tissues, &c. . , Parasitic plants and animals may also appear in the o y after death, and are therefore so far to be noticed amongs cadaveric changes. , • From these statements it will be perceived how cadaven changes may partly efface certain pathological. a tera > and partly simulate them; and consequently how important tt is to he upon our guard against being deceived by them m the examination of the dead body. The cadaveric changes above described are the most im- portant of those which usually ensue during the first days after death. At a later period they are so considerable that the examination of the body is of no use in leading to a cor- rect recognition of pathological relations. The alterations which then occur, fall within the province of forensic medicine, and do not require any further explanation in this place. Some of the changes subsequently occurring, greatest importance to forensic medicine, are fully lowing works: A.

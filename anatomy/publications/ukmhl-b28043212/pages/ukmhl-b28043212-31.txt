INTRODUCTION. 1 1 tice than by any verbal, or written instructions. The absence of any regularly adopted system of investigation—of that savoir faire which diminishes and shortens every difficulty— is not so indispensable, but that by application and careful in- vestigation it may be retrieved; and this very savoir faire, without such qualities, would only lead to charlatanism, daz- zling the eyes of ignorant spectators, but evolving no results useful to science. In the investigation of delicate points con- nected with pathological histology, the microscope is indispen- sable, and the application of chemical re-agents must be observed under it. Chemical analysis is, indeed, of the greatest importance to pathological anatomy, being the only means by which we can on several points obtain the desired information. At present, much to the detriment of the science, chemical investigation is little pursued in conjunction with pathological anatomy; but assuredly the time will soon arrive, when chemical analysis will be deemed just as indisjiensable to the prosecution of pathologico-anatomical investigations as the mi- croscope is at present, and when every follower of this science will consider chemical analysis so essentially requisite, that if his own time and opportunities prevent him from aiming it out, he will employ a chemist, under his immediate guidance and direction, to undertake it for him. Pathological anatomy derives the materials of its knowledge from two separate sources. First, from observation, which includes the examination of portions of the living body altered by disease, and removed either by the knife of the surgeon, or thrown off as excreta (in the widest sense of the word) together with the examination of the dead body, which is often sufficient of itself alone to explain to the practised observer the whole course of the disease. In most cases, it is, however, of importance that the exa- mination of the dead body should be supported and perfected by observations made during the progress of the disease. It is also essentially important to therapeutics, that pathological anatomy should be pursued by scientific, unbiassed patholo-

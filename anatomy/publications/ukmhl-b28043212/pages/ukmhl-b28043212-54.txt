DROPSIES. 34 &c. The disease is then known as dropsy of the cellular tissue (anasarca, hydrops telae cellularis). It is, however, by no means rare to find the parenchyma of internal organs affected in this manner, as in oedema of the lungs. More- over, certain forms of dropsy of the cellular tissue have received special names, as oedema of the cellular tissue of the upper part of the larynx (oedema glottidis), and oedema of the scrotum. Some writers* have denied that oedema occurs in internal organs of dense texture, as for instance, the liver, spleen, kidneys and brain. They are undoubtedly wrong, for collections of dropsical fluids occur in these structures, as will be shown when we come to speak of the organs specially ; but this condition may he easily overlooked, or ascribed to other causes. Moreover, dropsical fluids are sometimes found enclosed in recently formed membranous sacs, both in the cellular tissue and in the parenchyma of organs. These sacs, with their con- tents, are termed hydatids. They are closely connected, in part, with encysted dropsy, and in part with other formations that will be subsequently noticed. On examining the properties and chemical characters of dropsical fluids, we may divide them into : 1. Serous dropsy, in which the fluid is identical in its qualitative chemical composition with the serum of the blood. 2. Fibrinous dropsy, in which the fluid contains dissolved fibrin, and in its chemical composition resembles the plasma of the blood. 3â€˜. False dropsy (hydrops spurius), in which the fluid differs essentially in its chemical composition from either of the preceding forms. These three forms of dropsy differ, not merely in the physical and chemical characters of their fluids, but likewise very essentially in their causes. * Lobstein, op. cit. vol. I. p. 156.

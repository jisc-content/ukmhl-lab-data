THE LIVER-FLUKE. 466 similar vesicular tuberosity. From its head to its anterior third, the worm increases somewhat in thickness; it then contracts in diameter, and terminates in the tapering awl-shaped tail, of which the extreme point is so fine, that it is totally invisible to the unaided eye. The eggs are not symmetrical, being more convex upon one side than upon the other: they measure the 36th of a line in length, and the 62nd in breadth. These worms occur very frequently, and in great numbers in the large intestines—particularly the rectum—of the human subject; they are especially common in children; and in the female sex, sometimes pass into the vagina. They are not particularly injurious, but frequently excite an intolerable itching of the anus, and in this way become very troublesome. In the vagina they occasion still more violent irritation. See figures in Bremser, PI. i. fig. 6 to 12. SECOND ORDER. THE M ATODA. 1. The liver-fluke, (distoma hepaticum, Abilgaard; and dist. lanceolatum, Mehlis). These two s|>ecies of distoma, resemble each other very closely. They are flat, ovo-lancet- shaped worms, of yellowish colour, and somewhat truncated at both ends. With the aid of a lens, we perceive upon them, two round suckers, of which the anterior, situated on the head, forms an actual mouth. Between it and the body lies a short, scarcely distinct round neck, which merges very gradually in the body. The second sucker is situated upon the abdomen; it is roundish or oval, rather larger than the anterior, and instead of being perforated, forms only a blind sac. Between these two mouths, may be detected a third opening—the excretory duct of the sexual organs. The distomata are hermaphrodites. It is only very recently, and mainly through the labours of Mehlis, that we have acquired a knowledge of the distinction between the two species. VOL. i. H H

CELLULAR FORMATION. 117 I proceeds in this manner. In the first place, one or more finirtute granules (nueleoli) appear, around which the cytoblast : nucleus) is formed, and this again becomes surrounded with i i membrane (the cell-wall) which at first closely envelopes kt, but subsequently in the course of its growth, becomes separated from the nucleus, thus leaving a cavity between it kind the cell-wall. This is termed the cavity of the cell, sand is filled with a substance differing essentially in tcharacter both from the nucleus and the cell-wall. In the scell thus produced, the nucleus is not in the central | joint, but is situated eccentrically at a point on the inner surface of the cell-wall. It is from these cells alone, by a jroccss of further development, that all organized products arise. That this mode of development from cells occurs in patho- logical epigeneses may be readily shown in numerous cases, lid)is process can be most obviously traced in the formation tf pus-corpuscles, when they are produced from a fluid t jlastema on a free surface, or in a cavity connected with flhe exterior of the body. In such a case, we first observe ' numerous isolated granules,* which become surrounded by a Mrery delicate transparent cell-membrane,f which subsequently fcorms so thick and opaque a wall, that the nucleus can no : onger be seen through it on the addition of acetic acid, which dissolves the cell-wall, or at any rate renders it transparent, the nuclei again become visible.!) If it is impossible to â– 'race the whole course of development in one and the same cell, we can yet make out the successive changes of the whole ! mass of cells with sufficient certainty. These and similar ob- | nervations, such as tor instance may be made on the formation j }f epithelium, confirm the opinion that in all essential points "Schwann s theory' is applicable to morbid formations; but -hat in individual cases, many facts may be observed which * Plate in. fig.

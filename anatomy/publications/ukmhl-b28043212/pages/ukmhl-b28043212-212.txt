192 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. tions, which from their nature are most difficult, I do not regard as decisive. In a chemical point of view, the newly formed pigment closely resembles the normal pigment of the eye. The intensely black pigment, in melanotic lungs and bronchial glands, rendered as pure as possible by boiling in hydrochloric and diluted nitric acid, and then extracting with water, ether, and alcohol, appears from my repeated observations to be insoluble in sulphuric and hydrochloric acids, caustic am- monia, potash, and dilute nitric acid; it dissolves only m concen- trated nitric acid, at the same time undergoing decomposition. It is not decolorized by chlorine, though Bruch asserts to the contrary. Dr. Schmidt analysed in our laboratory two por- tions taken from different bodies, which appeared to corres- pond in their chemical relations, and in their action towards the above re-agents; the first, taken from the intensely melanotic lung of a miner in Clausthal, gave, after the deduc- tion of 12.48K of ashes, consisting of 10.6 silica (pulverized quartz), and 1.88 sulphate of lime:— Carbon • 72.95 Hydrogen . • • • ^.75 Nitrogen • • • .3.89 Oxygen • 18-41 100.00 In the other experiment, on a lung, hepatized inferioily, and whose bronchial glands were thoroughly melanotic, the deter- mination of the hydrogen could not be regarded as certain, in consequence of the smallness of the quantity subjected to analysis. It gave, after the deduction of 3.7352 of ashes, con- sisting of silica (powdered quartz) . Carbon • 66.77 Hydrogen . • • • 7.33? Nitrogen . • • . 0.4 J Oxygen . 1'^-^1 100.00

PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 262 gical elements, but the latter become themselves involved in the process of softening, and arc also destroyed, so that the expulsion of the mass from its place of formation is attended with a loss of substance. The softening of the pseudoplasmata, therefore, is not innoxious, but malignant and ulcerative; it consists not in a healthy suppuration, but in a process of ulceration. The difference between non-malignant and malignant softening is not confined to the above points; it extends even to the morphological formation of the product of the soften- ing. In the non-malignant softening this consists of the normal pus-corpuscles formerly described ; in the malignant, on the other hand, of very irregular molecules, which show scarcely a trace of organization, and resemble the products of the putrefaction of organic bodies, mixed with fragments of the destroyed tissues. This statement perfectly corresponds with that which was formerly advanced as the distinction between non-malignant and malignant suppuration. In fact no strict line of demar- cation can be interposed between malignant or ideerative suppuration (ulceration) and the malignant tumours; some kinds of the latter—the typhous, the scrophulous, and some of the tubercular depositions—form a debateable territory, which may be as justly annexed to the former as to the latter. This, however, holds good only for some forms; others, as encephaloid and scirrhus, are histologically distinct from common ulceration. The view maintained by C. Wenzel,* that pseudoplasmata (carcinoma) and ulceration are identical, is therefore, with certain restrictions, perfectly correct: it does not, however, hold good in all cases, and may be more accurately expressed by stating that the two are connected by a neutral ground. Besides the morphological distinction between ulcerations * Ueber die Induration und das Geschwiir in indurirten Theilen, Mainz, 1815.

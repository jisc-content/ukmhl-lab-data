341 PRECIPITATES OF FAT. saturated with margarin, it follows, that on cooling, a portion of the margarin separates in the crystalline form. Hence crystals of margarin are chiefly (if not exclusively) found after death, when the body has become cold. When human fat contains only a little margarin, then of course these crystals do not present themselves on cooling. Their occurrence must be regarded as forming the exception rather than the rule. Crystals of margaric acid are most commonly found in gangrenous parts, and appear to be a product of the decom- position of the margarin of the fat. The actual cause of this decomposition is still unknown, but may probably be traced to the presence of a free acid, which is frequently observed in gangrene. c. Olein at the ordinary temperature of the body is fluid, and separates in drops of all sizes (fat-globules), the larger of which are characterized by the peculiar manner in which they refract light. They occur partly free in the liquids of the body, and partly enclosed in cells.* These globules are insoluble in water and in acids, but dissolve readily in ether and hot alcohol, and, after prolonged ebullition, in potash. The behaviour of oleic acid (a rare constituent of the human body) is precisely similar. It is seldom that these fat- globules consist of pure olein or oleic acid; they most com- monly contain a portion of solid fat in solution. The causes influencing the formation of these fat-globules | aro not always clear. In general this is the original form of ! that in which, when it enters the body in large quantity, it proceeds from the food into the chyle. Sub- sequently, however, it appears to undergo changes, and to enter into combinations by which it passes into a state of solution. These combinations being destroyed, the olein again appears in the form of independent drops. Sometimes the free fat-globules proceed from the destruction of fatty

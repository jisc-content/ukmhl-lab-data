HERMAPHRODITISM. 521 These malformations occur in females and in males. a. IN FEMALES. In this case the resemblance to the male sex may be oc- casioned : 1. By disproportionate size of the clitoris, so that it may lie mistaken for a penis. This mistaking of the clitoris for a penis may, in infants, occur the more easily, since in the foetus, almost until birth, the clitoris is not much smaller than the penis. In many cases, again, the clitoris grows remark- ably after birth, and often attains a very considerable size (from two to five, or even seven inches in length, with propor- tionate thickness). In addition to this the clitoris is some- times furnished at its anterior termination with an orifice, which resembles that of the urethra of the male, or hies, infe- riorly, a channel which corresponds to the male urethra; sometimes also the prepuce is much developed. Now if, at the same time, as is frequently the case, there is constric- tion of the vagina, considerable development of the hymen, tumefaction of the Libia pudendi, approximation of the total habitus to the male sex by deep voice, traces of beard, and slightly developed mamtme; such individuals may be easily mistaken for men. 2. The apparent approximation of the female generative organs to those of the male, may be caused bv prolapse of the uterus. However improbable this sounds, yet cases are known where by reason of such a prokipse the sex became in the highest degree doubtful; indeed, when females have even married as men. For cases see Meckel, vol. u. p. 200 et seq. ; Nega. de congenitis genital, feemineor. deforraitat. Vratisl. 1837, (only a small portion of it, however, refers to this subject) ; Becker, de hennaphroditismo, Jenaâ€™, 1842 ; and Oesterr. mediz. Wochenschr. 1843, p. 701. b. IN MALES. A resemblance to the female sex is produced by several malformations.

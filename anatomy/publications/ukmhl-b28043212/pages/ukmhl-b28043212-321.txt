CANCER. 301 been made regarding the formation of elastic fibres; they appear, however, in some cases to arise from a channelled or reticulated thickening of the solid, membranous cytoblaste- ma. Regarding the chemical metamorphosis of the blastcmal fluid, by which the viscid substance of which we have made mention, and which is of such frequent occurrence in cancer, arises, we cannot offer even a probable conjecture. Hence it follows that cancer is a thoroughly morbid epige- nesis, and is not in the smallest degree produced by a meta- morphosis of the tissues between which it is developed. Another question to be considered is: What influence do the surrounding parts exercise on the development of cancer ? I mean by this, not the altogether unknown influence which the modified energies of the tissues doubtless exhibit in the formation of cancer, but simply the influence which the parent-tissue exerts on epigeneses in accordance with the law of analogous formation. An influence of this nature can have no weight in the formation of cancer-cells, since they are heterogeneous tissues, and their first appearance can be as little explained by that law, as the appearance of pus-corpus- cles On the other hand, the fibrous structures and the vessels of cancer may very possibly be formed by the influ- ence of the surrounding parts, in accordance with the law of analogous formationâ€”at least iu those parts which in their normal state contain vessels. According to this view, those kinds of cancer which contain fibres must be regarded as a combination of malignant tumour containing cells, with non-malignant fibrous tumour, and we shall show, in a future part of this work, the importance of it, for the more the fibres predominate in a cancerous tumour, so much the more innocuous and less malignant do we generally find it. The cancerous matter occurs between original elemen- tary parts of the parent-tissue, and occupies, more or less perfectly, all the interstices. A slight infiltration of can- cer in a tissue, frequently escapes the observation of the un-

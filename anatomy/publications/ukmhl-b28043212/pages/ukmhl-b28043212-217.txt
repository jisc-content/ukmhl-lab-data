Happily facts can never be set aside by witticisms. Further details on melanosis will be* given in our observations on melanotic tumours, and in the special department when we treat of the individual organs. EPIGENESIS OF NERVOUS TISSUE. The normal nervous substance consists of many elements histologically differing from each other. There are primitive nervous fibres which again are divided into cerebro-spinal, sympathetic (Yolkmann and Bidder), and central; further there are central and peripheral nervous corpuscles (gan- glionic vesicles) .f The pathological epigenesis of nervous tissue is rare, and only a few of the above named elements have been observed to be morbidly produced. In the way of regeneration, it is confined so far as we at present know to the epigenesis of nervous fibre (cerebro-spinal and probably also sympathetic), since after division, and indeed after the excision of small portions of the primitive fibres, the separated extremities "unite with one another by newly formed nervous tissue.} The nervous fibres thus formed arc very similar to the normal fibres,§ only that according to Nasse, they are some- what smaller. The morphological process in this formation is little known, but indeed our knowledge of the normal process is very deficient. Doubtless the nervous fibres are * Atlas d. patholog. Anatomie.

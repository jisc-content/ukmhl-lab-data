EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. 575 PLATE IX. ENCYSTED THMOLBS MELANOSIS. ^IG* 1 — 3. Show the histological elements of an encysted tumour, about the size of a nut, which was situated beneath the skin, im- mediately in front of the left ear of a young man, and was extir- pated by Breschet in the summer of 1839. Magnified 220 diameters. The matter contained within the cyst of this tumour, was a thickish fluid substance, somewhat resembling boiled groats, of a yellowish white colour, and possessing a strong acid reaction. When ex- amined beneath the microscope it was found to consist:— 1. Of pale very transparent cells, somewhat plicated, and from the 50th to the 100th of a line in diameter, (Fig. 1, A). The majority of them contained very pale nuclei. These cells underwent no change on the addition of acetic acid or ether, but by caustic potash they were gradually rendered more pale, and were eventually entirely dissolved. They formed the chief ingredient of the substance with which the cyst was filled, constituting about two-thirds of the entire mass. 2. Of tabular rhomboidal crystals of cholesterin, (Fig. 1, B) which were not affected by acetic acid or by caustic potash, but were soluble m ether; these crystals constituted about a fourth part of the sub- stance. 3. Of small round corpuscles, about the 250th of a line in diame- ter, (Fig. 1, C) resembling in form and general appearance pus- corpuscles and the cells of the undermost layers of the epidermis. On the addition of acetic acid the cell-walls of these corpuscles were rendered pale, and by degrees became completely dissolved; upon which a single or double nucleus in each corpuscle was brought into view. In this respect also they resembled pus-corpuscles. There was a tolerably large number of these corpuscles interspersed between the large pale cells already described.

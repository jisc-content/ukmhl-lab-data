Even in pus-corpuscles the sharp external outline is some- times absent, so that here we have no definite and limited deposition around the nucleus. This opinion, first suggested by microscopic observation, is confirmed by the laws of endosmosis. For while on the addition ot water to pus- corpuscles with an undoubted cell-wall, the membrane constituting the wall becomes first dilated, and then bursts and liberates the nucleus, pus-corpuscles without a decided cell-wall merely become swollen, without rupturing them- selves. Hence, in addition to the kind of cellular formation described by Schwann, according to which the cell consists of a constricted membrane surrounding a nucleus, we must assume a second kind, in which a somewhat indefinite pieci- pitation occurs around the nucleus. Moreover, the relation of the cell-wall to the nucleus in morbid products differs in many points from Schwann’s theory. A species of cellular formation occurs in which there are no pre-existing nuclei; thus pus-corpuscles without nuclei arc often observed; they are usually of an irregular form, and after the application of acetic acid leave only a few (fatty) granules, and sometimes not even these.|| These non- nuclcated pus-corpuscles arc always formed in large quantity in unhealthy suppuration, and apparently not singly amongst normal corpuscles; hence, in these cases the whole process of development appears from some general cause to undergo an * Plate i. figs. 1—6, and 13. t Plate i. fig. 12. | Plate i. fig. 11. § Plate i. fig. 2.

PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 294 i. Double cells formed either by the division of one, or the fusion of two cells. t. Cells filled with granules (granular cells) and others in which granules appear to be scattered over the surface.* In some forms of cancer there also occur: £. Cells of various forms and sizes inclosing dark (generally black) granular pigment (pigment-cells) .f Between these different forms of cells, there occur innu- merable transitions, and they are all doubtless to be regarded as primary cells in different stages of development. Some of these forms occur principally in certain varieties of cancer, of which they may be deemed characteristic, as we shall presently see. Hence it follows, that of all the above forms, there is none that can be deemed as solely pertaining to cancer; in fact that there is no such thing as a distinctive cancer- cell; and consequently that from observing a single cell under the microscope, it is impossible to decide with certainty whether it is cancerous or not. On examining a mass of these cells we can often decide with certainty on their being cancer-cells, from the varieties which they present, and from the occurrence of the above forms. b. The transitory cells occurring in cancer are chiefly fibre-cells, that is to say, they are fusiform cells prolonged in the same axis in both directions, such as occur in the development of areolar tissue, and of simple muscular fibre. J They occur for the most part in the firm, rarely in the soft forms of cancer. In the numerous forms of cancer which I have examined, I have always found these fibre-cells playing only a secondary part, and Hannover’s experience coincides with mine. J. Muller appears to have found them as the sole, or at all events as the predommatmg mgredien * See Plate vi. fig. 11 ; Plate viii. fig- 6- f These cells are precisely similar to the pigment-cells from a mela- notic lung, depicted in Plate ix. fig. 7. t See Plate vi. fig. 9; Plate viii. fig. 7 c, fig. 9 c.

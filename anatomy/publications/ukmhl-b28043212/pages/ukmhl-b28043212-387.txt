LACHRYMAL CONCRETIONS. 367 untenable. I certainly have occasionally, but not always found vibrioties in large numbers in the fur of the tongue, and in the viscid matter around decayed teeth, &c.; they had, however, no calcareous skeletons, ; while on the other hand, granular precipitates of calcareous salts were tto be met with together with these vibriones. If, therefore, the latter I play any part in the formation of tartar, it must be a very subordinate one. III. LACHRYMAL CALCULI. These occur under similar circumstances to salivary concre- 'tions. Although, in the normal state, tears form a very vwatery fluid, they contain a small quantity of calcareous salts, •which, when considerably increased by pathological conditions, can give rise to concretions. These are either formed in the lachrymal glands, in the eye, the lachrymal ducts, or the 'lachrymal sac. In the latter concretions, the fatty matter 'secreted by the meibomian glands occurs as one of the con- stituent parts. Fourcroy and Vauquelin found in calculi of the lachrymal gland, a i preponderance of phosphate of lime. The chemical composition of these concretions is often very complicated, as the following analyses show. IThese concretions contained in 100 parts .- 1 2 Phosphate of lime. 47.3 9 Carbonate of lime. 8.4 48 Carbonate of magnesia. 1.1 — Peroxide of iron. .... 0.9 — Chloride of sodium with soluble earthy matter. 5.9 Traces Mucus. ..... 20.3 18 Albuminous matter. _ 25 Fat. ..... 11.9 Traces Water. ..... 3.0 — 98.8 100 1. A concretion formed in the eye of a blind man, and examined and analyzed by Wurzer, (Berzelius, Thierchemie, p. 722). Yet it seems questionable to me whether this concretion can be reckoned as appertaining to lachrymal calculi. The fat was probably a product of the secretion of meibomian glands.

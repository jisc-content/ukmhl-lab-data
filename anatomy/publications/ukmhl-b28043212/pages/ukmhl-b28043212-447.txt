427 EPIPHYTES. instituted upon this subject, all of which show, that under con- ditions which otherwise prove favourable to the formation of fungi and algae, these do not present themselves, when the possibility of the transference of uninjured germs is precluded. Moreover, all the parasites hitherto observed, increase in enor- mous ratios by means of gemmules or spores : the latter are so infinitely numerous, so minute, and maintain their germinat- ing power so tenaciously against the most common exter- nal agents, that by means of water and currents of air they certainly become universally diffused, and can, there- fore, develop themselves wherever they meet with favourable conditions. That we have hitherto, in most instances, failed to demonstrate the origin of fungi by transference of germs, can be no argument against this mode of propagation; for, even in the most careful examination, certain fungus- spores, whose diameters are sometimes less than the 1000th of a line, may, and indeed always will escape the notice even of the most practised observer. In some cases the transference of parasitic fungi, or of their spares from one subject to another becomes facilitated by distinct relations, as immediate contact, &c.; as may occur in porrigo, in some forms of impetigo, mentagra, &e. These are the cases which are especially regarded as contagious. In general, however, peculiar condi- tions appear requisite for the development and increase of the transferred germsâ€”conditions which are in general only real- ized by pathological relations. It appears, for instance, that the surface upon which they are to develop themselves must in general, if not always, be in a certain state of chemical decomposition (putrefaction or fermentation); as, indeed, we find that externally to the human and animal organisms most fungi are developed only on putrefying substances. Experience shows us that parasitic fungi are especially liable to occur on foul ulcers, and probably only exist on the skin or mucous membrane, in the cases where these are furnished with a layer of decomposing exudation. Parasitic plants have so far a diagnostic value, that they indicate that a process of dccom-

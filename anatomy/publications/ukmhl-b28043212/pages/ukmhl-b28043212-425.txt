405 CHANGES IN CONSISTENCE. cellular tissue, &c. In some organs it has received special names; thus in the lungs, it is termed hepatization, because to a certain degree it communicates to the pulmonary tissue a resemblance to liver. Numerous cases of induration are dependant on the forma- tion of pathological epigeneses which penetrate between the histological elements, and render them firm and resisting. This effect may be produced by epigeneses of the most dis- tinct kinds, as for instance, tubercle, scirrhus, fibrous struc- tures, or concretions (ossifications). Since many of these epigeneses arise from coagulated fibrin, one kind of induration may gradually vary in its nature, and be converted into another. Hence it follows that induration is often merely an inci- dental consequence of other morbid elementary changes which have been already described. The consequences, like the causes of induration, differ extremely, in accordance with their nature and distribution, and the importance of the organ affected. Copious information on induration in general, and in individual cases, may be found in J. F. Meckel, n. 2. p. 14, &c.; Andral, op. cit. and Hnyle’s Journal de Med. vol. ix. p. 285. The reverse of induration is softening—a rubric under which it has been attempted to include all abnormal diminu- tions of consistence. Theoretically we may distinguish between lesser and greater degrees ot consistence, although there is no definite line, sepa- rating one from the other. Softening to a slight degree is often only transitory: it generally arises from an excess of fluid in the part, from satu- ration of its tissues with serum, or the accumulation of a more than ordinary quantity of blood in it. In this way many organs lose their normal degree of consistence, and become soft and yielding. This arises from causes which .have been already considered—hyperaemia and serous dropsy, lienee, it follows that some organs arc more liable to this forrr

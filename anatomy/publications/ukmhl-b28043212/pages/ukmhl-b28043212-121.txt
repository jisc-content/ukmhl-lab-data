PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 101 the terms organic and organized are not altogether sjnum- inous in relation to morbid formations. Like every thing else in nature, pathological growths re- quire a material for their formation—a matter from which they may be produced. To this which may be either fluid or solid, and may vary extremely in its chemical composition, we apply the general terms plasma, or formative matter. It is a necessary character of this plasma to be amorphous, it must neither be crystalline, nor have a definite organic form. An already formed structure can only assume that function by throwing off its shape and becoming again structureless. A plasma may act as formative material either for organized or unorganized products, or for both at the same time. 1 he plasma for unorganized formations, which is usually an aqueous solution, from which deposits are produced or crys- tals formed in accordance with chemical laws, we shall name a mother-liquid; the matter giving rise to organized for- mations which are chiefly produced by the formation of cells, we shall term a cytoblaslema* or, for brevity, a blastema; and lastly a plasma, from which organized and unorganized products are developed, will be designated as a mixed plasma. The manner in which pathological formations are produced from a mother-liquid is essentially different from that in which they are produced from a cytoblastema. The former being the most simple will be first considered. Almost any fluid in the body may act as a mother-liquid for pathological formations, if a portion of the dissolved un- organized or organized matters assumes an insoluble condi- tion and separates as a precipitate. The conditions under which this phenomenon ensues are very numerous; but, as far as yet known, are influenced simply by chemical laws. A deposition frequently occurs from too concentrated a eondi- * From Kvrof, a cell; and /3\«irrrj/ia, growth.

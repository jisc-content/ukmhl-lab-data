350 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 1. URINARY CALCULI. To this class belong all concretions whose mother-liquid is the urine. They may be formed in any part of the urinary apparatus; their most common seats of formation are, how- ever, the kidneys and bladder, and we consequently distinguish renal and vesical calculi. Calculi found in the ureters and the urethra are usually not formed there, but in the kidneys or bladder, and getting into those canals, become impacted there. It has happened, after injury to the urinary organs, that calculi have formed in the adjacent tissues into which there has been infiltration of urine. According to the above terminology we distinguish between urinary calculi, and urinary gravel or sand. Under the latter denomination we include the innumerable minute concretions which are so small that they can be discharged through the urethra without pain. Urinary calculi present great differences, not merely in their physical characters—as form, size, hardness, and colour—but also in their chemical constitution and in the relations inducing their formation. They sometimes consist of the same che- mical ingredient throughout, sometimes of a mixture of several substances; hence they are simple and compound. We shall first consider those which contain only a single ingredient :* 1. Calculi of uric acid and urates are the most common of all urinary concretions, but, according to the substances of which they are composed, they present many varieties. * The literature of urinary calculi is very copious. A list of the older writers would occupy too much space. Of the more recent authors we may especially mention: Berzelius in his Lehrbuch der Che- mie, translated into German by Wohler, vol. ix. 4th Ed. p. 486, &c.; Scharling de Chemicis calculorum rationibus, Havnise, 1839 ; or Dr. Hoskin’s English translation, London, 1842 ; and Taylor s Catalogue of the Calculi in the Royal College of Surgeons, London.

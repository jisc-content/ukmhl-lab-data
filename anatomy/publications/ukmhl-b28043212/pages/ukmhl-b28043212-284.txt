PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 264 These tumours do not arise, as was formerly supposed, from a transmutation of the normal tissues ; they are, rather, new formations which penetrate amongst the previously exist- ing histological elements of the body. Their cytoblastema is always originally fluid and only subsequently becomes solid: it generally fills up the interstices of the tissues amongst which it is deposited, as completely as mortar the spaces between the stones of a wall. This may be directly observed in pulmonary tubercle and in scirrhus, and it results from these observations that the cystoblastema is secreted in a fluid state, even in the cases where we find it solid: for this perfect impletion of all, even of the smallest spaces between the elements of the tissues can only be effected by a fluid. The cytoblastema is undoubtedly derived from the vessels, and is probably effused through the agency of the same causes which give rise to fibrinous dropsy. We possess no accurate knowledge respecting the chemical composition of the cytoblastema: although all observations hitherto made, tend to show that it contains the same elements as fibrinous dropsy, and that its coagulability depends upon dissolved fibrin. It may be possible that the cytoblastema of the different pseudoplasmata contains specific chemical princi- plesâ€”peculiar modifications of the protein-compounds: the present state of animal chemistry does not, however, allow of a positive affirmation or denial of this question. The effused cytoblastema undergoes changes which are very dissimilar in different pseudoplasmata: in some forms it becomes organized, and is converted into cells, amongst which, in certain cases, fibres and blood-vessels are formed: in others, scarcely a trace of organization can be detected, the cytoblastema remaining amorphous, or showing only very feeble indications of cellular structure. In all cases, however, the new formation finally softens, and becomes disintegrated, and in the disintegration there are involved not merely the permanently amorphous, but also the organised parts. The product of the softening is not,

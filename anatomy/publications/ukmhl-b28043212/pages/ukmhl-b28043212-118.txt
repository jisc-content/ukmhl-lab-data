98 PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. much more frequent occurrence after death than during life, and we may conclude that when it occurs very soon after death, the hlood during life must have had a tendency towards decomposition. In due time it invariably occurs in the dead body, as a consequence of putrefaction; ammonia and other products being formed, which dissolve the hsematin. This condition should be carefully studied, for the red colour dependant on it, (which is very frequently observed in the inner surface of the heart and larger arteries, and likewise occurs in the bronchi and other paits,) is very often mistaken in dissection for the redness of inflammation. This redness is for the most part less intense than that from hypersemia or extravasated hlood, and is more unifoimly distri- buted, more subdued, and rather of a purple than a blood- red colour. The microscope will always settle the point; it will show that the capillaries in the affected part are not gorged with blood as in hypersemia, and that there are no masses of blood-corpuscles as in extravasation. The latter are altogether absent, and, under the microscope, the part appears of an uniformly red colour, hut pale in proportion to the magnifying power.

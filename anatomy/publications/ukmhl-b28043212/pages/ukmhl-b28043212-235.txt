FIBROUS TUMOURS. 215 THIRD GROUP. TUMOURS CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF FIBROUS TISSUE. Fibrous Tumours. Tumours of which the prevailing element is fibrous tissue are very frequent, but they appear under so many varieties of form, not only in their physical properties, but also in their histological arrangement, that it is difficult to assign to them any general characteristic. Their varieties are not merely dependant on their being combined with other forms of tumour, but also on the different stages of development ot the tissue. We shall therefore in the first place attempt to give certain elementary types of these tumours. The forms which are most definite and easy of determination, are those where the fibrous tissue appears perfectly formed. This tissue as seen under the microscope consists of fibres, which can be more or less easily separated, and are sometimes very1 fine, some- times tolerably thick, their diameter varying between the 2000th and the 400th of a line. The fibres of the same tumour, are, however, pretty generally of nearly the same thickness. Histologically these fibres resemble either those of normal areolar tissue, in which case they are fine and measure from the 2000th to the 1 200th of a line; or they resemble those of the nor mid fibrous tissue, as of fibrous membranes and tendons, in which case they are somewhat thicker, and measure from the 1200th to the 900th of a line; or lastly they resemble normal simple muscular fibre, in which case they are broader, and have a diameter varying from the 900th to the 400th of a line. All these fibres are rendered transparent by acetic acid, becoming gradually pale till they disappear: occasionally, however, a few larger ones (varying from the 1000th to the 500th of a line) remain unchanged in acetic acid; these divide in an irregular manner

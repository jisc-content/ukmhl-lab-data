324 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. SECOND FORM. FIBROUS CANCER SCIRRHUS. Synon. Cancer scirrhosus; carcinomatous sarcoma; hard cancer; car- \ cinoma simplex ; carcinoma fibrosum.* Under the term scirrhus we include those forms of cancer in which the fibrous tissue predominates, and which are ; consequently firmer and harder than encephaloid: hence its name.f In its early stages we find more frequently than in encephaloid, a firm, amorphous blastema; hence scirrhus does not invariably exhibit decided and perfectly formed fibres, for here as in the genuine fibrous tumours, the blas- tema does not always, even in the more advanced stages, undergo transformation into distinct fibres admitting of isolation, but sometimes permanently remains as an indefi- nite fibrous mass, holding a position both morphologically and chemically between coagulated fibrin and the gelatigenous fibrous tissue. The fibrous portions of scirrhus coincide in ; cverv point of view with those of non-malignant fibious tumours, and hence, as we have already mentioned, scirrhus must be regarded as a combination of encephaloid with fibrous j tumour. There are thus an endless number of transition- forms, the extremes ot the series being on the one hand encephaloid, and on the other fibrous tumour. The mutual j relations between the fibres and the cancer-cells vary ex- tremely in scirrhus; sometimes both elements occur with a certain degree of regularity, the fibres forming net-work or capsules, whose interstices and cavities are filled with cells, or else radiating from certain points; sometimes on the other * See Muller, op. cit. or Westâ€™s translation; Hannover, op. cit- p. 22, &c.; Lobstein, Anatomie pathol. vol. i.; and G.

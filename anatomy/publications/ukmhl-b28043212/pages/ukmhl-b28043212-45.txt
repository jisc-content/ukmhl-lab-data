25 PNEUMATOSES. however, shown that in the eructations which precede vomit- ing, and, therefore, probably also in many other cases, atmos- pheric air enters the stomach through the oesophagus. I con- fess, however, that to me the mechanism by which the air is driven into the stomach is not perfectly clear. According to Budge, the stomach enlarges its cavity by an active tension, and then the air is driven in by the ordinary laws of physics. How the stomach can, by a contraction of its muscular fibres, dilate itself, and thus produce a vacuum, I do not understand. If the fact is placed beyond doubt, some further explanation is at least requisite. It is possible that some of the cases in which gas is dis- charged from the generative organs of the male, from the uterus, and the urinary bladder,* may be explained in this way: namely, by a mechanical pressure of the air into these parts in consequence of a peculiar antiperistaltic motion, or dilatation of the organs. In the same manner, in all probability, the air passes from the stomach into the other parts of the intestinal canal; however, most of these collections of gas in the intestinal canal admit of another explanation, as we shall immediately see. On making a chemical analysis of these gases, it is found that in their composition they are identical with common air; but that in consequence, probably, of their prolonged contact with the blood and other organised fluids, they undergo changes similar to those which occur in the lungs in the act of respiration: viz., the oxygen is, in part, replaced by carbonic acid, and is saturated with hydrogen. 2. Gases are developed in the body in consequence of decomposition, fermentation, and putrefaction. It is well known that most organic matters undergo decom- position at the temperature of the human body and in the presence of water, even when air is excluded. This decompo- sition occurs under the forms of fermentation and putrefaction ; * P. Frank, op. cit. p. 724â€”726.

584 EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. PLATE X. CONCREMENT A EPIPHYTA EPIZOA. Fig. 1. Shows the crystalline deposition of cholesterin in atheroma of the aorta. Magnified 220 diameters. An old man, aged eighty-four years, who had died from a per- forating ulcer in the stomach, exhibited a deposition of calcareous salts (false ossification) in the arch of the aorta, between its inner and middle coats, besides a deposition of a yellowish-white greasy mass, (atheroma). This soft mass was found to consist of the fol- lowing elements, when examined under the microscope :— (1) . Of many tabular colourless crystals of cholesterin, of the ordinary characteristic form, (rhomboidal tablets with angles mea- suring 103° and 77°). (2) . Of many irregular amorpho-granular masses, which did not dissolve in water, but were soluble in alcohol; after the evaporation of which, they again thickened into amorphous brownish clots pro- bably fat. Besides these elements and some few fat-globules (3), nothing was present. Fig. 2. Crystalline deposition of calcareous salts in the cuticle of the scrotum. Magnified 220 diameters. A healthy man, aged thirty-three years, a baker by trade, had suffered from pruritus of the scrotum, from about his eighteenth year. There had gradually appeared upon the scrotum small wart- like excrescences, which after they had attained the size of a pea, dried up and disappeared; after which, new formations appeared in other parts, which again underwent the same change. 1 his process has continued to the present time, (March, 1841), without much incon- venience to the patient, or the slightest influence upon his general health.

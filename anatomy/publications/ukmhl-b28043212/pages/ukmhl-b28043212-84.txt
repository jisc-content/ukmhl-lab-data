64 PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. as has been observed by Scherer and Simon* Thirdly, pro- bably also on the formation of a free acid in the blood, whereby a portion of the albuminate of soda becomes decomposed, and albumen, in a finely granular form, becomes separated. The turbidity dependant on the presence of fat is sometimes observed in perfectly healthy persons, shortly after partaking of an abundant meal, when the blood is receiving a large quantity of chyle. Turbidity, arising from coagulated fibrin, was observed by Scherer in a pregnant woman with bronchitis tuberculosa, in a leuco-phlegmatic person suffering from attacks of vertigo, and in a spirit-dnnker with cerebral con- gestion ; Simon noticed it in a man with Bright s disease. It would appear as if this separation of the fibrin in a gram ,11 form, were owing to some peculiarity in its mode o coagu- lating. The causes of the turbidity in these cases may c readily detected by the microscope ; the fibrin-gramdes dissolve in acetic acid and in a solution of nitrate of potash ; the fa - vesicles which may be recognised by their peculiar , are not soluble in these fluids but dissolve in ether, serum sometimes appears reddened in «^blood- corpuscles being suspended in it; this is chic y no the coagulation is imperfect; it occasionally, but more , a. el , dependant on a solution of the htematin, of which . .

Our information ,s limited to this that we sometimes find the blood thinner than in the norm, ondition sometimes thicker and more viscid; a change of consistence is usually associated with a modification in c • Untersuch. p. 85 and 87.

435 FUNGI IN TINEA FAVOSA. cases small; occasionally, however, they acquire an importance from obstinately resisting all efforts to eradicate them ; and in certain cases, they appear, by their development, able to destroy organized parts of the body, as for instance, the hair. In a diagnostic point of view their value is greater, since, where they occur in large masses, they are accus- tomed to impress upon the pathological change a peculiar character. The following are the most important of the forms hitherto observed. 1. Fungi in the scrofulous scald-head, (Tinea favosa — Porrigo lupmosa—Favus and Alphas : Fuchs). The crusts in this disease; consist for the most part of fungi, which are united by, or rather, are rootl'd in an amorphous matter, (dried fibrinous effusion.) The fungi of favus closely resemble yeast plants ; in their most simple form they appem* as roundish or oval cells which increase by gemmation. The gem mules are frequently elongated into filaments, which are either simple or ramified.* Acetic acid produces no change in these fungi, but renders them more distinct, in consequence of rendering transparent the amorphous mass in which they are enclosed. I am firmly persuaded that in tinea the (scrofulous) exuda- tion from the vessels of the cutis, is the primary cause and essential condition; it prepares the bed in which the trans- form! germs are developed. Attempts to inoculate the disease by transference of fungi to other parts of the skin of the same body, or to other individuals, commonly fail, as has been shown by the experiments of Gruby, J. H. Bennett, and myself. That the development of the fungi originates within the epidermis or beneath it, is improbable : yet the germs may gain access to its inferior (most recent) layers by means of fissures in it, occasioned by the exudation, * See Plate x. fig. 6 and 7.

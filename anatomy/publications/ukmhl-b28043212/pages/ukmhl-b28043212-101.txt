PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. 81 Scherer* found carbonate of ammonia in blood taken from the arm if a typhus patient. The means of detecting this substance are given m p. 67. c. The blood may contain a substance precipitable by acetic acid, resembling pvin. Scberert found a substance of his nature, together with free lactic acid, in the blood of a * woman who had died from metroperitonitis. This observa- tion is important, because a similar, if not the identical â€¢matter, is of common occurrence in exudations, in pus, in ^scirrhous tumors, &c., as we shall presently see. To recognize this substance, the serum must be boiled in order to separate the albumen, and then treated with acetic acid, which throws down a precipitate insoluble in an excess of the reagent. D. Tlie blood may contain sugar in cases of diabetes melli- tus. As the process for the recognition of this substance is intricate and difficult, I shall not attempt to describe it. E. The blood may contain bile-pigment which may be detected by the rules given in p. 63. In addition to these abnormal conditions, indicated by the art of the chemist, there are others which can only be de- teeted by microscopic observations; of these the most impor- tant are pus-corpuscles and entozoa. In morbid conditions of the system, pus-corpuscles in the blood are not of very rare occurrence. They are in some cases produced within the vessels, in others they enter the vessels from without. Respecting the means of detecting them, their significa- tion, and their mode of development, we shall have various occasions to speak. Entozoa have also been discovered in the blood, especially t Op. cit. p. 160. G * Op. cit. p. 69. VOL. 1.

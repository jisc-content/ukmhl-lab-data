COMBINATION OF MORBID CHANGES. 412 CHAPTER VII. MUTUAL COMBINATIONS OF MORBID ELEMENTARY CHANGES. The changes described in the preceding pages do not always occur singly; many sometimes being manifested simultaneously in the same, or different parts of the body. The recognition of the connection in which they stand to each other, forms consequently as important a question as the in- vestigation of the individual changes themselves. We may pursue the investigation of this combination of different changes in two ways. The first is by means of the numerical method, which leads to a correct conclusion, in as much as it shows the greater or less frequency of the simul- taneous occurrence of these changes, but leaves the cause of these combinations, and the intimate connection of different changes entirely in the dark. The second method endeavours to point out the intimate connection of individual changes, and thus explain the facts elicited by the first method. In our introduction we spoke of the various degrees of impor- tance existing between these two methods in their application to pathological anatomy. We will here consider the latter mode, since, as far as is compatible with certainty, it deserves a preference over the former. In deciding between those pathological changes which occur simultaneously in the. same part, and those which affect different parts at the same period, we must not lose sight of the fact, that here the question relates to the smallest parts

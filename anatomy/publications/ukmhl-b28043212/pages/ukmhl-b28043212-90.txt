70 PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. lating, we are not at present in a condition to state with any degree of certainty the chemical causes of these changes. Consequently we are not yet in a condition to draw any valuable inferences from the changes undergone by the blood in the dead body. Changes in the odour and taste of the blood have been noticed by different observers; thus the taste of the blood of syphilitic women has been observed to be saline; of jaun- diced persons, bitter; and in cases of rachitis, acid ;* in scurvy and putrid fever, it has a putrid odour; and Barruel even asserts, that from the odour developed on the addition of sulphuric acid, he can distinguish the blood of man from that of woman, and recognise the blood of different animals. Experiments of this nature in respect to the taste and odour of the blood are generally of trifling importance, although the former might be serviceable in the detection of odorous matters, not easily recognised by tests, in the blood : as for instance, alcohol, phosphorus, hydrocyanic acid, &c. Changes in the blood-corpuscles.â€”It is well known that the blood-corpuscles undergo numerous changes, when brought in contact with various reagents, as well as j during the decomposition and putrefaction of the blood.f j Numerous as these changes are, the causes producing them may be referred to two distinct types. Firstly7, they may j be of a merely physical character, and dependant on endos- mosis or exosmosis, as when the blood is diluted with water, or mixed with a concentrated saline solution. In the former case, the blood-corpuscles become tumid, and the central depression disappearing, they cease to be biconcave and become spherical. In the latter case, they become contracted, ' irregular and indented at the edges, or present the appearance * Lobstein, Path.

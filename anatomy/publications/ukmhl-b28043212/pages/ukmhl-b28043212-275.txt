ENCYSTED TUMOURS. 253 hereditary, and not very unfrequently are observed in several members of the same family. The forms which contain hairs are most frequently situated in the neighbourhood of hairy parts, on the temples, near the eyebrows, &c.; these which, besides hairs, also enclose teeth and bone, have been hitherto met with only in the ovaries; those which contain horn, most frequently exist upon the upper part of the head. All these encysted tumours are perfectly non-malignant: although, like all non-malignant tumours, they may either from exciting causes, or, spontaneously, if they have attained a con- siderable size, become inflamed and break. Frequently, however, they exist throughout a whole life without injurious results. They can be removed without again forming: if, however, the extirpation has not been complete, and a part of the sac remains behind, this, on account of its epithelial investment, cannot become united to the adjacent parts: it continues to secrete, and the encysted tumour reappears in its former condition. Causes and origin. Some of the encysted tumours which enclose cells and fat, most probably arise from sebaceous glands of the skin, which, owing to some obstruction in their excretory duct, become distended with their accumulating secretion. This mode of origin is, however, certainly not so frequent as A. Cooper believed,* and, at all events, can only apply to such as exist in or immediately l>encath the skin: it cannot take place in encysted tumours of the internal parts, nor in those which contain hairs, bone, and teeth. Certainly in very many, if not in most instances, they are new organs formed by morbid processes, and we can readily suppose that their development is similar to that of serous cysts. If any pathological exudation, which is incapable of further organi- zation, as for instance pus, becomes deposited in the body, * Surgical Essays, vol. n. p. 236.

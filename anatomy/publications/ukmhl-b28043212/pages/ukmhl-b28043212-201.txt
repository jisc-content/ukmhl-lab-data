EPIGENESIS OF FAT. 181 t Plate x. fig. 3. * Plate vii. fig. 1. EPIGENESIS OF FAT AND ADIPOSE TISSUB. Fat occurs in the normal body under very different con- ditions. It is present as adipose tissue, when cells with an amorphous cell-wall contain fluid fat; as fat-globules, or granules (the latter being usually very minute) in many fluids; anti as dissolved or imbibed fat. There are as many, and, indeed, greater differences in those fats which result from a pathological epigenesis. Those of most common occurrence are morbidly formed adipose tissue, as in fatty hypertrophy (the fatty dropsy, or polysarkia of some writers); abnormal adipose tissue, as in the fatty dege- neration of many organs, for example, of the muscles and the kidneys; independent fatty tumours, which either consist entirely of fatty tissue, as lipoma, or of a union of that with areolar tissue, forming steatoma. All these formations are characterized by the fat being enclosed in peculiar cells (fat- cells), which more or less resemble those of normal adipose tissue.* These fat-cells sometimes (especially when cold) contain crystalline depositions of margarin.f In other cases, the newly formed fat occurs free, in larger or smaller vesicles, which are usually so minute, that they can only be recog- nized with the microscope. They may be distinguished by the peculiar manner in which they refract light, and by their solubility in ether. These fat-globules occur either free amongst other histologic elements, as, for instance, between the hepatic cells in many forms of fatty liver; between the different coats in obliterated vessels; in the substance of encephaloid; and in certain fluids, as in blood, pus, &c.; or, they are found in the interior of cells, as in those of the liver.J Where these accumulations of fat do not occur as distinct globules, but infiltrate the tissues t Plate i. fig ix.

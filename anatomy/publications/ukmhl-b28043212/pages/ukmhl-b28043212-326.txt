PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 306 the original; proceeding of necessity to softening. In some cases, we find the peripheral portion of the cancerous matter, and the surrounding parts contending, as it were, for the cytoblastcma, and sharing it between them. There are formed, as may be observed in cancerous ulceration, fungoid and extremely vascular granulations; but these are always so infiltrated with cancerous matter, that, after a very brief exis- tence, they soften and become disintegrated, never contri- buting to the formation of persistent tissues. Distinct from this local enlargement of cancerous tumours, there is another mode of increase, which usually occurs in the latter stage as softening commences, or sometimes earlier. There are formed other cancerous tumours distinct from the original tumour, often many in number, some being situated in close proximity with the original seat of the disease, namely in the adjacent lymphatic glands, whilst others occur in remote parts of the organism. The causes of this distribution of cancer are still very obscure —an obscurity which is increased by the circumstance that we are in a great measure ignorant of the causes of the pri- mary deposition. Doubtless the same cause which gave rise to the first tumour, influences the formation ot the others. This cause appears to be in operation when, long after the removal of a cancerous tumour—often years after, and when the wound caused by the operation had long healed a new cancerous tumour becomes developed in another part of the body. To this cause we usually apply the term cancerous diathesis, a phrase against which no objection can be raised, since it is merely the expression of an unknown fact, just as x represents the unknown quantity in an unsolved equa- tion. Another mode in which a cancerous tumour may increase, has been noticed by B. Langenbeck.* When cancer-cells make their way into the veins and lymphatics opened by the * Sclimidt’s Jahrbiicher, vol. xxv. p. 99, &c.

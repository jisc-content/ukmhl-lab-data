NON-MALIGNANT TUMOURS. 205 OF NON-MALI GNANT TUMOURS ANALOGOUS TO THE NORMAL ELEMENTS OF THE BODY. To this class belong those tumours whose elements agree with the newly formed tissues, occurring in cases of regene- ration and hypertrophy. The tissues which occur in them are areolar, fibrous, and simple muscular tissue, adipose tissue, vessels, granular pigment, cartilaginous and osseous tissues, and in a few cases also hair, teeth, &c. Sometimes they consist principally of a single tissue, but more frequently of several in conjunction, and in the utmost possible variety of combinations. Some of them are intimately connected with the surrounding normal parts of the body, and arising from the same elements, form as it were a sort of hypertrophy. Others are quite distinct from the surrounding parts, some- times even so far as to be surrounded by a membrane which cither consists of the normal elements of the surrounding parts (chiefly areolar tissue) compressed by the tumour, or else is itself a pathological epigenesis. This membrane is most clearly seen in those tumours which are termed en- cysted. W As in their histological composition, so also in their modes of origin and development, there is an entire similarity between these tumours and cases of regeneration and hyper- trophy. They follow in all respects the genend law which has been previously laid down for the pathological formation of the elementary tissues. They further resemble cases of regeneration and hypertrophy in their physiological functions and in their further progress. Like them they exhibit various properties in their several stages of development; like them they are nourished and increased, and form persistent consti- tuents of the body, often enduring many years before death supervenes, usually increasing and very rarely becoming smaller. It is upon these circumstances that their non-

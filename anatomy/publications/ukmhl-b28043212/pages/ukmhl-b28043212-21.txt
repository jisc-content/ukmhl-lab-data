The great object of works on the Anatomy of the Human Body in a state of health, is the description of the elemen- tary tissues and their properties, and of the manner in which these tissues are arranged and distributed so as to form the different organs; further, to explain their mode of formation, and the manner in which the whole body is developed from them. The whole of these elementary textures, tissues, and organs are in each individual body essentially the same, although occasional differences present themselves, which it veryâ€™ striking, are described as varieties. The case, however, is different when a body, or a portion of it, which has suffered from disease is submitted to ana- tomical examination. Here deviations from the appearances presented by the healthy body are frequently observed. These deviations are very numerous in character ; sometimes the elementary textures are changed; sometimes new formations foreign to the normal condition are introduced; in some cases the position or form of some of the organs is changed; whilst in others the deviation has reference merely to particular por- tions or elements of one or more organs. The knowledge and description of these changes, and the investigation of their origin and development constitute Pathological Anatomy, which, therefore, depends upon healthy anatomy as its natural basis ; the former embraces as its peculiar study precisely that which the latter rejects.

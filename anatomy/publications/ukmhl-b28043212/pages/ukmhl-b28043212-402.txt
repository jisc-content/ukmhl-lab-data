382 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. in the gland by the stoppage of the duct, or for any other reason, it thickens and forms a concretion. In this case the concretion consists principally of those sub- stances which constitute the normal secretion, namely fats and fatty acids, epithelium, extractive matter, and a certain amount of salts. If the salts predominate, the concretion belongs to the second class. These concretions occur for the most part in the sebaceous glands: they are essentially identical with the false encysted tumours formerly described, which are formed by an accumu- lation of the secretion in an occluded gland, and are distin- guishable from them only by their more solid contents. 2. The secretion of the gland may deviate from the healthy standard, and contain an excess of earthy salts; in this case precipitates will be formed which, on drying, will be gradually converted into stony concretions. The following may serve as illustrations of concretions in the cuta- neous glands. A concretion of the former sort, analysed by Fr. von Esenbeck,* consisted of a soft mass, winch when dried by exposure to the air, formed a yellowish white powder. On triturating it with water, a milky liquid was produced which, after standing for several days, did not putrify, and which did not coagulate on boiling, but was precipitated by acids, corrosive sublimate, and infusion of galls. It consisted of: Solid fat. .... Alcohol-extract with a trace of oil. Water-extract. . . . . Albumen (cells ?). Carbonate of lime. Phosphate of lime. Carbonate of magnesia. A trace of acetate and hydrochlorate of soda. 24.2 12.G 11.6 24.2 2.1 20.0 1.6 and loss. 3.7 100.0 A concretion of the second kind formed in the scrotum, and analyst * L. Gmelin, ii. 2, 1397.

explanation ok THE PLATES. 549 PLATE V. EPIGENESIS OP BLOOD, BONKS, NEBVKS, AND SEROUS MEMBRANES. The Figures from 1 to 4 illustrate the pathological epigenesis of of blood in the adult. The following case will serve as an illus- tration. A young man, aged twenty years, suffered from encephaloid of the left arm, which slowly developed itself, and finally ulcerated. Re- peated haemorrhages rendered amputation necessary. The amputated part could not lie obtained for microscopical examination. About ten days after the amputation, fungoid growths, which came from the medullary cavity of the bone, appeared. When removed, they were of a whitish-yellow colour, soft, fatty, and amende. When examined under the microscojie. they were found to consist of areolar tissue in the act of development, (granulations). Two days subsequently, on renewing the bandage, another growth from the medullary cavity of the bone, of precisely similar appear- ance. was observed It was as large as a cherry, and externally brown (being discoloured by the liniment, ex. jmh ' cort. dhW), and s invelled, and internally of a yellowish-white, lardaceous appearance. Its consistence was so soft and mellow, that it could easily be broken off by the finger without the assistance of any sharp instrument It had sprouted from the medullary cavity of the bone. Under the microscope, it appeared throughout as a granulo-amor- phous mass, which, on the addition of acetic acid, became pale and transparent. It was almost wholly unorganized, only exhibiting at a few spots traces of cells, partly of indefinite form, and partly t IongRted, (the fibrous cell** of areolar tissue). A recent section of the mass (Fig. 1. left side) showed many small points and streaks of blood. These small portions of blood in the

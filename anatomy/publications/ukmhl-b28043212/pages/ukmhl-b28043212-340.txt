PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 320 deceptive feeling of fluctuation, before the commencement of softening. With regard to its anatomical arrangement in the mass, encephaloid sometimes forms only a single tumour, and some- times many; and varies from the size of a hemp seed to that of a manâ€™s head. These tumours are usually blended with the surrounding parts (infiltrated encephaloid), but occasionally they are perfectly separated from the adjacent tissues, being enclosed in an indefinite capsule of areolar tissue, which sometimes exhibits the characters of cartilage (the combination with fibrous cancer) just as is generally observed in newly formed areolar tissue. Sometimes encephaloid occurs in small patches enclosed in fibrous partitions, presenting a certain resemblance to the normal structure of the pancreas (pan- j creatic tumour). There are other varieties which are less striking to the eye, and which from the absence of any thing with which to compare them, have received no special names; jj they all, however, serve to elucidate the histological arrange- j ment of encephaloid, and its relations to the parent-tissue, i The latter is usually so concealed by the morbid deposit, that j frequently even the most careful examination fails in detecting ; its elements. When encephaloid is developed in external parts of the j body, as in the bones of the extremities, or the subcutaneous ; cellular tissue, it gradually becomes blended with the skin, which is thus rendered distended and oedematous, the superficial veins standing forth like blue cords. It finally ulcerates, and ^ there are formed fungoid growths, irregular leafy and cauli- flower granulations, which are usually extremely vascular, and bleed on the slightest provocation (fungus hrematodes); these 1 granulations are not inclined to become organized; they , unite, and discharge to such a degree, as rapidly to induce death by colliquation. The diagnosis of encephaloid is essentially characterized by the same signs as those of cancer generally. From scirrhus

Calculi consisting for the most part of carbonate of lime : they are crystalline, with rough surfaces terminating in sharp angles, of a clear or sometimes rather brown colour, f 7. Gall-stones of a whitish colour, saponaceous feeling, and concentric laminated arrangement, which on scraping assume a polished appearance, and consist for the most part of cho- lesterin. 8. Gall-stones consisting of alternate white layers of cho- lesterin, and dark yellow layers of bile-pigment. The two last kinds are by far the most common. Gall-stones frequently exhibit a nucleus differing from the remainder of the mass, and consisting for the most part of mucus and epithelium coloured by bile-pigment: this, while the stone is fresh, is soft; but, on drying, shrivels up, and gives rise to a central cavity. Sometimes the nucleus consists of a foreign body—as a worm, or a portion of a needle.J The nucleus does not invariably lie in the middle of the stone, showing that the growth of the concretion has not been uniform ; this is especially observed in calculi sacculated in a diverticulum of the gall-bladder. A gall-stone has sometimes more than one nucleus, namely, when several originally distinct concetions unite with, and become fused into one another. The following analyses may serve to give an idea of the varying che- mical composition of gall-stones. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Cholesterin 96 65 67 50 4 7 Bile-pigment 3\ 25 -} 35 ( > 89 Mucus — J — J / Biliary matter 3 17 — J 8 o 100 Calcareous salts — 2 ,.''

426 l’ARASITES. species of parasites, with especial regard to those hitherto observed in man, although, so far as they serve to elucidate the subject, we shall also notice those which occur in animals. PARASITES DERIVED FROM THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM EPIPHYTES. All the parasitic plants which, up to the present time, have been observed in the human organism, belong to the lowest forms of vegetation—the algae and the fungi. They are all very minute, so that, to the unaided eye the greater number are totally invisible, and others are only perceptible when accumulated in large masses. In order to recognize their peculiar structure, and thus to arrive at a more ac- curate diagnosis, the microscope is invariably necessary, and very high powers are often required. They are found either upon exposed surfaces, namely upon the skin and mucous membranes, or floating in the fluids of the body. I am acquainted with no authentic case in which they have been observed during life in the parenchyma of human organs. Respecting the origin of vegetable parasites, there are the same two different views which have been noticed in relation to the origin of parasites generally. Whilst, for instance, Kiitzing* who has devoted much of his attention to the lower algae, maintains that their origin, by repeated spontaneous generation, is possible, others limit their origin to the mode by propagation. Although a positive decision of this disputed question may at present be impossible, it nevertheless appears to me that there are overwhelming reasons in support of the view that they invariably owe their origin to propagation alone. These reasons are chiefly founded upon the researches of Schwann on fermentation, upon similar investigations of Helm- holtz,! and upon others which Dr. Merklein has abundantly * Phycologia generalis.

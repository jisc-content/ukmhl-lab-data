We must likewise refer the reader to the chapter on the morbid ana- tomy of the liver and biliary apparatus, in the second volume. VII. INTESTINAL CONCRETIONS. Concretions are not often formed in the human intestinal canal, being much rarer than those hitherto considered. We ! meet with them after death in any part of the digestive tube, l between the stomach and the rectum, or they are removed by vomiting, or with the fieces. There arc two distinct kinds to be considered: 1. Concretions formed in the intestinal canal itself, from its own contentsâ€”true intestinal concretions. 2. Concretions formed in other parts, and which find their way into the intestinal canal. In the latter class belong all gall-stones, which getting into the duodenum arc discharged by vomiting or bv the rectum, or are occasionally found in the intestinal canal after death. They may be easily recognized by the characteristic properties of gall-stones. That actual gall-stones consisting of biliary constituents arc primarily formed in the intestinal canal, is not improbable, although the individual constituents of the bile (modified bilin, dyslysin, &c.) are not rare in true intestinal calculi. Moreover, it occasionally seems to happen that true gall-stones, when retained for some time in the intestinal canal, serve as nuclei for other depositions, and then become converted into true intestinal concretions. Pan- creatic calculi may also, in some few cases, escape through the orifice of the duct, and may be readily mistaken for true intestinal concretions, the chemical composition of both being very similar. Moreover, we must not mistake for true intes- tinal concretions the hard matter which has been observed by Gurlt, as forming in the mucous glands of the duode- num. True intestinal calculi exhibit great differences in their

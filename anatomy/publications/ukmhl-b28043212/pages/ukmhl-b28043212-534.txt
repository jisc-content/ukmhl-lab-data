MALFORMATIONS. 514 gastrodidymus, Gurlt). The lower extremities may in this case be single or doubled. Barkow, vol. n. p. 39. Geoffrey St. Hilaire* names this from Psody- mtts.Y A case recently described in Froriep’s N. Notiz. vol. v. p. 152, of a double monster, born at Stammsried (Bavaria), in January, 1838, should probably be placed in this division. e. The duplication may extend as far as the centre of the abdomen, while the lower halves ot the body, from the umbilicus downwards, coalesce, (didymus symphyohypogas- trius, Barkow—kypogastrodidymus, Gurlt). The lower extremities are likewise sometimes doubled. Barkow, vol. ii. p. 40. Geoffrey St. Hilaire,} names this form Ischiopages ,• while Dubreuil assigns to it the term Isehiadelphus. The following recent cases have been recorded: J. A. Pereira, in Ediu. Med. and Surg. Joum. 1S44, vol. lxi. p. 58; Montgomery, in Todd’s Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology, “ Abnormal Anatomy of the Foetus,” p. 317. f. The duplication may be almost complete, and the two bodies amalgamated at only a circumscribed spot, at the perineum, the sacrum, or coccyx, (didymus symphyopeii- neeus, Barkow—pygodidymus, Gurlt). Barkow, vol. n. p. 40. Geoffrey St. Hilaire* names this form Pi- pages. The Hungarian sisters, Helen and Judith, who were born at Szony, in Hungary, in the year 1701, and after being exhibited for a Ion? time throughout Europe, died in their twenty-second year, afford a good illustration of this form. 3. The duplication may extend to the inferior half of the body, while the superior half is more or less single. a. The duplication may be limited to the organs of gene- ration, and the urinary bladder, and consequently to the anterior part, of the pelvic region (diasdeeus,\\ Barkow). This form is rare, and hitherto has been observed only in animals.

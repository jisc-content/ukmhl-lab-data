441 PARASITIC INFUSORIA. species of vibrio (v. lineola?) in the pus of chancres.* Of other infusoria, I have sometimes found in faeces the exuvite, and less frequently, active specimens of navi- cula. Upon foul ulcers and in the pus from them, vorticella and also colpoda eucullulus have been occasio nally observed. Donnef asserts that he has found a peculiar infusorium, which he names trichomonas vaginalis,j in the vaginal mucus of syphilitic females; it is supposed by R. Froriep and Ehrenberg to be a species of aearus. I, however, agree in opinion with Gluge and Valentin, that probably this ima- ginary infusorium is not an animal at all, but separated ciliated epithelium from the uterus.^ The occurrence in the living body of the infusoria which have been described, and of other species which probab ly will yet be occasionally observed, need occasion no surprise, if we consider that infusoria generally, and especially the specified forms belong to the most abundant of all the lower animals, which make their appearance by millions whenever conditions favourable for their development are afforded. They have little or no pathological importance, and at most serve but to show that, where they appear, there exists a putrid decompo- sition of the elements of the body to a greater or less extent, not otherwise demonstrable by exact means. Donnd main- tains that the vibriones of chancres (and even the trichomo- nas) constitute the true contagion of syphilis, an opinion which is directly controverted by the fact, that these animal- cule do not exist in the pus of syphilitic buboes, which, nevertheless, according to Ricordâ€™s experiments, by inocula- tion also produce actual chancres. * Recherches mimmeopiquea sur la nature des mucus secretes jmr les orgaues genito-urinaires, Paris, 1837. t Op. cit. t Sec Plate x. fig. 9. $ Siebold also maintains this ojunion, op. rit. p.

FUNGI ON MUCOUS MEMBRANES. 437 a case described by Mayer,* in which fungi had developed themselves in the external auditor)’ meatus of a girl—an observation which is especially interesting from the fact, that the fungi attained a much higher grade of development than in the cases previously described. Fungoid structures have been observed on the integument of animals more frequently than on man. In addition to the instances already cited, Bennett, (op. cit.), has found uj>on a domestic mouse, fungous structures perfectly similar to those which occur in the tinea favosa of the human subject. He also observed fungi upon the skin of a gold fish (cyprinus auratus). III. PARASITIC FUNGI ON THE MUCOUS MEMBRANES OF THE HUMAN BODY. These are by no means unfrequent, and in recent times have been seen by numerous observers. In essential relations they perfectly resemble those occurring on the skin, and they appear never to hike root on sound mucous membrane, but always upon a decomposing exudation from the mucous surface. We find them in the aphthae of children, and on the pseudo-membranes which cover the mucous membrane of the mouth and fauces in diphthcritis attacking adults; in certain cases they are found in ulcers of the mucous membrane in typhus and other diseases. In form they sometimes approximate to the fungi of favus ; at other times they differ from them in growing out into long thaUus-filamcnts, which at certain parts, commonly at their termination, present protuberances in which granules (spores) are developed.

438 PARASITES. * See Plate x. fig. 12. mentioned works. J. H. Bennett once found fungi in the sputa and lungs of a man with pneumothorax,* and several times in the black matter which invests the teeth and gums of patients in the last stage of typhus, (loc. cit.) PARASITIC ANIMALS. The parasitic animals occurring in the human subject, pre- sent in their relations a much greater diversity than the para- sitic plants. Attempts have been made to classify them according to various arrangements. 1. According to the parts of the body, and the organs which they are accustomed to infest. In this respect a dis- tinction is drawn between epizoa (ectoparasites) which live upon the surface, and entozoa (entoparasites), which inhabit the interior of the body. This division is, however, some- what arbitrary since, for example, the intestinal cavity, which lodges by far the greatest number of entozoa, compared with the external surface of the body, is undoubtedly and relatively internal; compared, however, with the parenchyma of the organs it is relatively external. Moreover, some only ot the parasitic animals have a definite part of the body or an organ for a habitation, out of which they are never, 01 only rarely found, whilst others have a very wide distri- bution, and probably in different stages of development can exist in the most dissimilar parts. 2. They have been classified according to then- position in the zoological system. This classification of parasitic animals is the most valuable even for the practical physician, since it alone leads to a perfect comprehension of the forms and distinctions of the separate species, and since we must look exclusively to scientific zoological investigations for further information respecting the obscure mode of origin of these animals, and their occurrence in the human body. 3. Parasitic animals may be distinguished into those

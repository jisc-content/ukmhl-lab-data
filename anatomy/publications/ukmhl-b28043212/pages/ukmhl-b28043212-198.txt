178 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. nine hours. Usually, however, a much longer time is required for its formation. The chemical relations of this epigenesis are very imper- fectly understood; in the formation of vessels, the same chemical forces are doubtless exerted as in the formation of areolar tissue, of elastic tissue, and of simple muscular tissue; that is the protein-compounds of the blastema become con- verted, partly into a substance yielding gelatin, and partly into other substances, with whose chemical composition we are still more ignorant. With respect to the chemistry of the formation of blood there is not the least difficulty in account- ing for the production of the blood-plasma from the exuded fluid; both being in fact identical. Moreover there is no difficulty in supposing that the globulin of the blood-corpus- cles is formed from the protein-compounds of the exudation, although it has not yet been artificially procured. The for- mation of the hsematin is equally obscure in this case, and in the ordinary formation of blood. EPIGENESIS OF EPITHELIUM AND EPIDERMIS. The epidermis, as well as most forms of epithelium, as for instance the pavement epithelium consisting of several layers, exhibits in the normal condition a continuous epigenesis on the one hand, and a continuous destruction on the other. On the surface which is turned to the subjacent cutis or mucous ] membrane, new cells are continually forming from the blas- tema afforded by the vessels of the subjacent membrane; these become further developed, undergo the ordinary changes, , and at length having arrived at the surface, are gradually rubbed off and removed. A precisely similar process takes place when these forma- tions, after being destroyed by any morbid cause, are repro- ducedâ€”the most frequent class of all pathological epigeneses. . In a case of this nature so long as any inflammatory irritation is present, the cytoblastema afforded by the vessels of the

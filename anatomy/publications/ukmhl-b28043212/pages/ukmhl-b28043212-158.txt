138 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. * Plate in. fig- 11 a. of pus, it is thick, tough, opaque, and studded with minute granules. In many cases, pus-corpuscles have no definite or distinct cell-wall, consisting merely of a nucleus, and an irre- gular deposition around it, without any clearly definite out- line, as may be shown not merely from microscopic investi- gation, but by their relation towards endosmosis. This is especially the case with young imperfectly formed pus- corpuscles. Moreover, there are many differences in the contents of the cell occurring between the cell-wall and the nucleus. In pus-corpuscles with a single nucleus, a well-marked mem- branous cell-wall, and consequently a cavity between them,* we often find no solid body in the cell-cavity, excepting the nucleus. The contents must therefore be fluid, and doubtless identical with the serum of the pus, containing dissolved albumen; for the corpuscles are rendered turbid and opaque by reagents which coagulate that substance. In other cases, in addition to the nucleus, granular contents are seen, with independent chemical reactions. Sometimes the contents seem as it wnre so thoroughly fused into the cell-wall, that the two form only a single substance, a solid but soft mass in which the nucleus is imbedded. Endosmotic and chemical relations of the pus-corpuscles. When either solid or fluid substances are allowed to react on pus-corpuscles, numerous changes, dependant on two diffe- rent causes, are observed to take place. One of these causes is the endosmotic activity of the pus-corpuscle itself; the other is the chemical action of the reagents on the various mate- rials entering into the composition of the pus-corpuscle. Generally speaking, both forces are simultaneously in action; we shall, however, consider them separately, in order to deter- mine with greater accuracy the effect of each individual reagent. When pus-corpuscles are submitted to the action of fluids,

I give below a few analyses of pus, selected at random,* and by their side, for the purpose of comparison, I likewise place the composition of the plasma of the blood. 1000 parts contained: Blood-plasma l 2 3 4 Water . . 906 902 907 862 769 Corpuscles (fibrin) 3.41 80.4 60 63 91 180 Fluid albumen . . 77 / Extractive matter 3 20 29 19 Salts 8 13 (6) (9) (9) Fat 3 25 9 12 24 1000 1000 999 994 992 1.

Hence it is obvious that the analyses of the blood-plasma, and of pus may present great variations without destroying the analogy which subsists between them. The conversion of the blood-plasma into pus always occupies a certain time, during which it is exposed to all the modifying influences of metamorphosis and endosmosis, to which must be added that a considerable evaporation of fluid takes place from sup- purating surfaces. Hence pus is usually more concentrated, and con- tains less water than the plasma from which it is formed. Formation of pus. The formation of pus is dependant on two very distinct circumstances. In the first place, a fluid must be secreted or separated to act as a cytoblastema; and secondly, the pus-corpuscles must be formed in and from this cytoblastema. The latter follows the general laws ; regulating organic development. The cytoblastema of pus is always the fibrinous fluid which has already been described in our observations on fibrinous * Numerous amdyses of pus will be found in the works quoted in the note in p. 133, especially in the Treatise of v. Bibra.

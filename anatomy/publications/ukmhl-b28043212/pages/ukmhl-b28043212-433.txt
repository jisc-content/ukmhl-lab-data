VENOUS HYPEREMIA AND NERVOUS DROPSY. 413 visible through the microscope—the elementary parts of tissue—and not only to Larger masses, as whole organs, or those parts that are seen by the naked eye. In the earlier ages of pathological anatomy, observations were limited to what could be detected by the unaided eye, the consequence of which was that changes of whole organs were treated en masse, and brought under one category of common names; accurate histological investigations have, however, led to the conviction that most of those changes, which were formerly regarded as simple, are of a composite nature ; and the combi- nations of morbid changes have consequently been studied with increased attention, and show us that many which were formerly overlooked, are really of the highest importance to pathology'. It further follows that changes, which are the opposite of each other in their nature, may yet co-exist in the same organ—as induration and softening, increased redness and pallor. The connection between co-existing morbid changes may be more or less intimate. Many changes of this kind stand in the relation of cause and effect: in some the con- nection is either very remote, or not to l>e traced; we might even term it accidental, if we could admit the idea of Chance in the phenomena occurring in the human orga- nism. The pathological changes arising from a common cause may be* ranged in certain groups, of which the following are the most important. FIRST GROUP. VENOUS HYPER.EMIA AND SEROUS DROPSY. Every venous hyperaemia may apparently occasion serous dropsy (see p. 40) and hence both cliangcs occur very fre- quently in the same organ. We seldom meet with venous hypenemia without dropsieal effusion, except in cases where the hyperaemia is so recent and slight that the effused fluid

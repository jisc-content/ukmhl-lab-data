135 PUS. J Plate in. fig. 1. : linear power of 50—100 ; but in order to study with accuracy their properties and structure, they should be magnified 200 —400 diameters. Their form is in general spherical,* and is regular in pro- portion as the pus assumes a normal character. Sometimes they arc irregularly rounded, elongated, oval, or rugged; and .generally speaking, they are irregular in proportion as the pus deviates from the normal type. Their diameter varies (from the 200th to the 300th of a line; it seldom exceeds the 150th or falls below the 400th. These fluctuations in size are apparently dependant on the individual from whom the pus is obtained, or on the nature of the disease ; sometimes we find that all, or the greater number of pus-corpuscles from an abscess or wound are small; in other cases that they arc all large. In some cases the pus-corpuscles are very delicate, pah1 and ;t transparent, and their surface smooth and even ;t but more commonly they are opaque, tough, uneven and granulated, rthat is to say, studded with very minute particles from the 1000th to the 1500th of a line in diameter.} When observed separately, they appear colourless; in heaps, they exhibit a yellow tint. They are only slightly c lastic, but 11 very soft, and under the compressor are reduced to an amor- phous magma. They are specifically denser than the serum, and gradually fall to the bottom. Many deviations of the corpuscles from the normal form w ill be de- scribed in our observations on abnormal pus. The corpuscles of genuine pus are organized forms, for the | most p;crt of a cellular nature, with a nucleus, cell-wall, and I contents. The cellular structure with a decided nucleus, appears only * Plate in. fig. 1 and 2. t Plate in. fig. 11, a.

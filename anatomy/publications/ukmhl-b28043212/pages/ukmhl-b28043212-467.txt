447 PARASITIC ARACHNIDA. minute researches will point out an origin by propagation in all cases. For the abundant occurrence and increase of most species of lice, certain conditions, as want of cleanliness, &c., appear to be necessary; and indeed, sometimes ev en a certain disposition of body, delicate skin, youth, &c. This appears especially the case with ped. tabescentium, which as several observers attest, never pass to healthy individuals, their occurrence always indicating an antecedent morbid character of the fluids. Nevertheless upon this subject much still remains to be per- fected by future researches. In fleas, on the contrary, the incursion appears to be much less restricted to any peculiar disposition. It is very interesting in a pathological point of view to observe how unequally different species of these parasites nmk as morbific agents. Pulex irritans, pediculus pubis, capitis et vestimenti are rather troublesome than dangerous guests; pulex penetrans, on the contrary, always induces serious consequences, and sometimes even proves dangerous to life. The same holds good regarding ped. tabescentium, where it occurs in great abundance, idthough it is not esta- blished, whether its occurrence he the cause, or merely the effect of a general disease.

In the class arachnida then' arc many animals injurious to human life bv their venom, as for instance, many kinds of scorpions and spiders; these, however, do not bear on the present subject. One family of this class, however, that of the mites (acarina) comprises several species which infest the human subject, and are more or less pernicious. These must now occupy our attention. They arc very minute, almost microscopic animals with dis-

529 POST MORTEM CHANGES. dissection cannot be immediately made, and it Incomes, therefore, necessary to be acquainted with those cadaveric changes which, under ordinary relations, generally occur within a day or two after death, in order to conclude from them whether the alterations which present themselves are really of a morbid character. The most important cadaveric changes are those which take place in the blood and vascular system. They are inti- timately allied to the formerly detailed modifications of the blood, and have been in part already described (see pp. 59â€” 98, 391, and 403). The blood coagulates first in the larger vessels, namely, in the heart and the large venous trunks, and to a less degree in the arteries, which are often contracted after death, having expelled the greater part of their contents. When they afterwards again relax, the blood has coagulated and does not return into them. The blood does not, however, always coa- gulate : in many cases, where its fibrin is modified and has lost its characteristic coagulability, it remains more or less fluid. Considerable alterations commonly ensue in the distribution of the blood. Capillary hyperamia may diminish or totally disappear, sinie, by the contraction of the arteries and capillaries oc- curing alter death, the blood is more or less expelled from them. Hence, capillary hyperaemia which existed during life cannot always be discovered in the dead body, unless the exa- mination has been made at a very early period. This morbid change is most frequently and beautifully observed in hot climates, where the examination is generally made a few hours after death. On the other hand, venous hyperccmiu may increase or ori- ginate after death, since the blood contained during life in the arteries and capillaries leaves them with the post mortem contraction of these vessels, and passes into the veins fur- nished with more yielding walls.

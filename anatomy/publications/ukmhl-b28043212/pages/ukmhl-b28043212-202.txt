PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 182 of the body, they are then recognizable by chemical ana- lysis rather than by the microscope. Depositions of fatty granules occur under the same circumstances as those of fat- globules ; in fact the two are usually associated, and the latter are only distinguished by containing chiefly solid fat—mar- garin, cholesterin, and serolin—whilst the former consist of fluid fat (olein). The fatty granules are for the most part small (elementary granules) ; sometimes single, sometimes in groups, and forming various kinds of aggregate corpuscles and granular cells, and often deposited in very considerable quantity. They must not be confounded with the elementary granules arising from the protein-compounds which occur under similar circumstances, but differ from fat-granules by their insolubility in ether. Many deposits of fat assume a crystalline arrangement; thus, margarin and margaric acid form acieular crystals united in tufts and stars,* while cholesterin forms rhomboid tablets.f Pathological depo- sitions of fat form the transition between organized and unorganized epigeneses; whilst newly formed adipose tissue must be regarded as truly organized, crystalline de- positions of fat must undoubtedly be regarded as concre- tions. The horny scales described by Valentine! and Gerber§ are doubtless crystals of cholesterin; so, also, in all probability are the rectangular tablets described and depicted hi several places by Gluge. The causes, morphology, and chemistry of the develop- ment of these products present very great differences. The question concerning the ultimate causes of this formation of fat is connected with the still imperfectly understood theory of nutrition, and this brings us to the much disputed subject * Plate x. fig. 3. t Plate x. fig. 1.

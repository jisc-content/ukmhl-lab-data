143 PUS. nd flocculi of amorphous or semi-organized fibrinous exu- ations. The liquor puris, or serous fluid, in which the corpuscles wim, may be separated by allowing thin pus to stand for > ome time in a high and narrow glass; the pus-corpuscles hen gradually sink to the bottom, while in the upper part of he glass there is pure serum. This fluid is identical both in its physical and chemical â€¢haracters with the serum of the blood: it is an aqueous solution of albumen, extractive matters, various salts, and ait. The qualitative composition of this serum is tolerably .-constant, but the quantities of the different ingredients vary considerably, as we have already seen to be the case with the dropsical effusions. It is upon these slight differences in the chemical composition of the serum that the varying action of pus on vegetable colouring matters is dependant. If the alkaline carbonates (?) or basic phosphates predominate, the pus has an alkaline reaction, as is usually the case with fresh and good pus. Subsequently an acid (lactic?) is deve- loped in it, which first renders its reaction neutral and then acid. The serum of pus occasionally contains a viscid matter, which may be distinguished by its being precipitated by acetic acid and by alum. It was first described by Giiterbock, under the term pyhi, and regarded by him as characteristic of pus. This is not the case: pyin rarely occurs in good, and more frequently in abnormal pus; it likewise occurs in other morbid products, as for instance, in carcinoma; and even at the present time too little is known regarding its properties and chemical composition to allow of its being known by a definite name. Taking a comprehensive view of the quantitative analyses of pus, it appears in essential points to coincide with the plasma of the blood, or fluid of fibrinous dropsy. There is only this difference, that a portion of the protein-compounds which

PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 218 uterus, vve frequently meet with every stage of transition from isolated fibrous tumour to local hypertrophy: and condylomata, warts, and fibrous polypi form transitions from the isolated fibrous tumour to local hypertrophy of the cutis and mucous membrane. In all these cases it must of course follow that just in proportion as the tumour is less isolated, and more connected with the surrounding parts, in such proportion its form must be undefined. Other fibrous tumours are definite circumscribed and less closely connected with the surrounding parts, usually being separated from them by a kind of cyst of areolar tissue, which, however, as we have already mentioned in our observations on fatty tumours, is more closely united to the surrounding parts than to the tumour. In these cases the external form of the tumour is more defined; it is commonly irregularly round, but occasion-ally presents an interlaced or ragged appearance. Sometimes the fibrous tumours are so perfectly isolated, that they show scarcely any connection with the surrounding parts, but lie free from them as it were in a sheath, and on cutting the surrounding capsule fall out. This is occa- sionally noticed in fibrous tumours of the uterus, which are sometimes quite detached (like a knot in a board) in the parenchyma of that organ or in its cavity, so that, in some cases even during life, they can be removed without sup- puration or other process of destruction, simply by uterine contraction. In such cases, the form of the tumour is usually clearly defined, sometimes appearing perfectly round like a musket-bullet or billiard-ball, and sometimes nodulated. Doubtless the direction taken by the fibres is the most influ- ential cause in modifying the form and properties of the surface All perfect fibrous tumours contain vessels ; it is only in very small tumours of this kind that I have been unable to discover them. It is, however, probable that the isolate tumours just mentioned are non-vascular, and that t ey receive the blastema necessary to their growth from the

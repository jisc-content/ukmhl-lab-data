CHANGES OF COLOUR. 393 forth, (sec the chapter upon the changes of the body after death). This gives us no insight into the pathological condi- tions during life. The paleness, thus elicited by various causes is not always purely white, but has frequently a tinge of green, blue, or brown; and this is owing to the tissues themselves not being of a pure white colour, and to other faint tints from granular or fluid pigments, as bile-pigment, hsemaphaein, &c., (which, in a normal condition, are concealed by the deeper colour of the blood), now? appearing more distinctly; moreover the blue coloration of the veins, which we sh;ill presently notice, con- tributes to these results. Besides the paleness, which depends upon the blood, other causes may induce a pallor in parts which are, normally, colouredâ€”as fatty depositions, fatty degeneration of the muscles, liver and other organs, coagulated fibrin, tubercular matter, especially non-vaseular epigeneses, and unorganized depositions of the most various kinds. They act in a twofold manner, first by compressing the vessels of the part, whose normal redness depended upon their quantity of blood, and secondly by thrusting a new and faintly coloured mass into the original tissue. Local pallor is further called forth by a deficiency of pigment in parts where in a normal condition it exists, as in the skin, the hair, and the eyes in cases of leucosis (Albinos).* For further particulars of ;dl these changes of colour, and their causes, we must refer to the special part. Abnormal redness appears much more frequently than ab- normal paleness, and likewise admits of classification under different heads, according to its causes; although it is easier to do this theoretically than to decide, with certainty, empiri- cally upon any individual case. We may have : 1. Redness from hyperaemia of the capillaries, the charac- teristic properties of which have been already described, (p. 86). * See Meckel, Patholug. Anat. n. 2, j>. 2.

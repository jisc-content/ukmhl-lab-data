409 CHANGES IN CONSISTENCE. * See Piatt ix. fig. 8. tour of the primitive bundles.* Tissues with greater power of resistance, as the vessels, elastic tissues, bones, and epi- dermis are decomposed at a much later period, or not at all. Similarly to extravasated blood, other fluids wrhieh easily p:iss into a state of decomposition, as urine, intestinal excre- tions, &e., may give rise to a decomposition and softening of the tissues, when in anv manner they are infiltrated into them. To this class of softening belongs unquestionably another, which depends more upon general than local causes: for instance, there are cases, in which the whole mass of the blood undergoes a certain change or decomposition, which we must designate under the term putrefaction, with- out at the* present time knowing what are its chemical changes. The fluids separated from the blood, as the general nu- trient fluid, being more or less modified, may induce a decom- position and softening of the tissues. Thus in typhus, and when the blood is loaded with bile-pigment, (as for instance in severe cases of icterus), very extensive soften- ing occurs, w hich has been well designated under the term, gangrene. This condition is naturally susceptible of the most numerous modifications, and it is probable that it would ultimately lend to a general softening of the whole body, if, as a rule, death did not rapidly ensue. In such cases, the changes already begun, progress much more rapidly after death, but it is not generally possible to decide from the exami- nation ot the body, how far this softening had proceeded before, and how much had occurred subsequently to death. In a few eases, a local softening of a higher degree, appears to be induced in the softer parts, by the mere presence of serous fluid. Thus in the brain, we sometimes find in high degrees of serous dropsy, that the walls of the cerebral ventricles have a pultaceous appearance, extending to a slight depth (from half a line to

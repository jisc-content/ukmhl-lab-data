157 GRANULAR CELLS. This view of the formation of granular cells is confirmed by Bennett.* According to Gluge.f they are formed by the adherence of the nuclei of dissolved blood-corpuscles : but the nucleus of the human โข blood-corpus- cle is itself of doubtful existence, and I have sometimes observed the development of these cells, as distinctly as, considering the difficulties of the case, could be expected. From their chemical relations the granules appear to consist partly of fat, soluble in ether, partly of a modification of protein similar to the f molecular granules of normal pus, insoluble in the alkalies and in borax, and partly of salts of lime (the carbonate and phosphate). I am con- | vinced that the true granular cells are formed from cells which as a : general rule first appear pale in colour, containing a nucleus, and with fluid homogeneous contents, which subsequently become granular. It . is true, that this process cannot be directly observed; I have, however, 1 Been in very many cases where these granular cells were present, that when the development was not very far advanced, there were undoubted cells without any or with only a few granules that when the development was somewhat further advanced, the cells appeared for the most part, or entirely filled with granules ;ยง and finally, that when the development was perfect, they formed irregular granular heaps and scattered gra- nules. |j The whole course of events in that form of pulmonary hepati- zation which does not proceed to suppuration, but disappears by resolu- tion, confirms the above view. It is true that in this case, we have only the opportunity of instituting microscopic observations, when the patient is carried off by some other disease during the stage of resolution ; I have, however, met with several such cases. Here we observe in the first place, that so long as the mass remains firm, there are only a few granules, but numerous undoubted cells ; as development progresses, the cells diminish and the granules increase in number, and finally, after perfect softening, there are fewer cells and fewer granular heaps ; the latter being broken up into separate granules. Some observers, espe- cially Henle and Bruch,*[j have declared themselves against my view regarding the mode of formation of granular cells, but still I cannot help * Pathological and Histological Researches on Inflammation of the Nervous C entres, in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal.

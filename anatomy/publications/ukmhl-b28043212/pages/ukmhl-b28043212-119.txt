99 pathological epigeneses. CHAPTER IV. PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES.* In the primary formation of the body, and subsequently in its nutrition, new formations (elementary' particles and tissues) arise, interpolated as it were between those already existing. A somewhat similar process is of frequent occurrence in pathological formations ; indeed, so frequent are these mor- bid epigeneses, that the greater number of the changes which pathological anatomy can demonstrate after death may be arranged under this head. At the same time, they are so various, and the relations of their formation, development, and termination in individual cases so different, (two or more epigeneses being frequently .associated and combined,) that a satisfactory description of these conditions, including a clear arrangement and separation of the individual elementary phe- nomena is a task of the greatest difficulty. In order not to lose ourselves in the details connected with this extensive department of our science, and at the same time to acquire a clear view of these various relations, we shall attempt to work out, as far as possible, the general laws followed by pathological formations in their development. These laws are very' closely allied with those which direct the development and formation of tissues in the normal state; indeed, in many cases, no definite line can be drawn between normal and abnormal formations. * Neubildungen, literally, new formations.

MALFORMATIONS DEPENDING ON FISSURES. 501 THIRD CLASS. MALFORMATIONS, IN WHICH PARTS NORMALLY UNITED ARE SKPARATKD FROM EACH OTHER FISSURES. In this class of malformations, parts which normally are united appear cleft at some spot in the mesial line. The manner in which these malformations originate, can l>e very clearly shown by the history of development, although the causes giving rise to them are not very obvious. The cavities for the brain and spinal cord on the one hand, and of the chest and abdomen on the other, are known to be produced in the following manner; the parts of the embryo, at first forming laminae, rise on each side, and gradually approach each other, uniting in the mesial line of the body. If this union does not take place, or if, having already occurred, Separation through any cause (as, for instance, the excessive accumulation ot water in a cavity of the body) ensues, a fissure arises. It is usually accompanied with a protrusion of those viscera which normally lie within the fissured cavity, or if the cleft involves only a part of the structures (muscles and bones) forming the wall, whilst the external skin or internal serous coat remains undivided, a rupture (hernia) occurs. In a similar manner we have smaller orifices as congenital malformations; open- ings, as the foramen ovale of the heart, the ductus botalti, and the urachus, which in the normal state become closed at a later period of fu*tal life, or immediately after birth, do not close, but remain patent. The higher grades of the fissures are closely allied to some groups of the first class of malfor- mations. On fissures generally, and their individual forms, the reader may con- sult C.

67 PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. * Untersuch. p. 68. (the alkaline salts) altogether destroy it. Thus, in a case of putrid typhoid fever, Scherer* found carbonate of ammonia in the blood, which was black and pitchy, and did not coagu- late into a solid clot, but merely formed a diffluent saline ! mass. The presence of the carbonate of ammonia was shown by the deve- lopment of a white vapour on holding a glass rod moistened with non-fuining hydrochloric acid over the blood; and further by t le circumstance, that the blood distilled on the water-bath \ieldid a dm which had an alkaline reaction, mid frothed on the addition of an acid. The volume of the clot to that of the serum differs extremely in different cases; sometimes the clot is small, while above it there is a very considerable quantity ot serum, sometimes it is large, occupying nearly the whole volume of the blood, while only a very small quantity of serum is separated. These proportions, like those we have just con- sidered, are also dependant on the coagulability of the fibrin, which stands in a direct ratio to the compactness of the clot, and to the amount of serum expressed from its interstices. Hence the presence of a large amount of serum must not lead us to infer that the blood contained an excess of water; neither is a large clot to be regarded as a certain indication of the presence of an excess of fibrin. The coagulated fibrin of the blood likewise exhibits diffe- rences in its chemical relations. Such differences occur in health between the fibrin of arterial and venous blood ; thus, venous fibrin gradually dissolves in an aqueous solution of nitrate of potash, while arterial fibrin is insoluble in that menstruum. In inflammatory affections, however, the coagu- lated fibrin of venous blood is frequently insoluble in that solution. This a point worthy of consideration. 3.

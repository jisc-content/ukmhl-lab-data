PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. 72 blood-corpuscles frequently takes place in ten or twelve hours, in consequence of the rapidity with which putrefaction com- mences in this disease, as has been frequently observed by myself, and confirmed by Gluge.* * * § Duboisf found that the blood-corpuscles of scrofulous persons were devoid of the proper colour, some having lost it at their edges, others entirely; moreover some were more flattened than usual, while others presented a tumid and spherical appear- ance. Changes in the blood-corpuscles may easily be induced by diluting the blood with water, or thin syrup, or by the evapo- ration of the liquid portion of the serum during the experi- ment ; hence, the necessity for great care in such observa- tions. In microscopic examinations of the corpuscles of defibri- nated blood, we sometimes, but not always, observe that they indicate a tendency to arrange themselves with their surfaces in contact, in forms resembling rolls of coin. This tendency is interesting, since it very probably plays a part in many pathological phenomena; thus it favours the formation of the buffy coatj since the corpuscles, arranged in this form, sink more rapidly than in ordinary cases. Henle§ remarks that this arrangement is closely connected with the occurrence of inflammation, being the cause of the stagnation of the blood in the capillary vessels. Hence it would be of much impor- tance to ascertain the cause of their tendency to adhere to each other. Henle believes that it arises from an excess of albumen, and at the same time a deficiency of salts in the serum of the hlood. I have instituted several series of expe- riments with the view of elucidating this important question ; they did not, however, yield any definite results.

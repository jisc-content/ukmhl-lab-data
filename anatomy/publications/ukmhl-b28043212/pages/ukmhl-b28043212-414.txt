CHANGES OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. 394 The colour is, as a general rule, of a vivid red, and appears to the naked eye, on account of the smallness of the capil- laries, as if the parenchyma of the part were tinged with red ; and it is only by microscopic examination, that the colour is seen to resolve itself in red capillaries and colourless interstices.* 2. Redness from venous hypercemia, (p. 85). Here there is mostly a bluish red, but sometimes a brownish red, or even blackish brown colour exhibited by the dead body, frequently changing into a clear red, after prolonged exposure to the air. The hyperacmic veins are distinguishable with the unaided eye or with a lens, and their interstices appear colourless. In this category we have the blue disease, (cyano- sis), in which several parts of the body, as the lips, cheeks and finger ends, are more or less deeply tinged with a purple hue.f In both these varieties of abnormal redness from vascular hypersemia, the deepened colour may not depend alone upon hypersemia of the normal vessels, but may be occasioned by newly formed vessels, as in granulations, telangiectases, and in encephaloid. 3. Redness from extravasated blood (p. 89—97) is frequent- ly associated with that which arises from capillary hyperemia. 4. Redness from infiltration of dissolved haematin, (page 97—8). The diagnosis of, and the distinctions between these diffe- rent conditions, were so fully discussed in their proper places, that nothing further remains to be added. I will merely remark, that by changes in the dead body, a state of hyperaemia of the capillaries, having existed during life, may disappear; and conversely that venous hypersemia, and infiltration of haematin, which did not exist during life, * See Plate n. fig. 1 a, b. t See a plate elucidating this point in den chirurgischen Kupler e n, 18'JO, Plates iiin—lv.

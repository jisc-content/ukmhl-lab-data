Dropsical fluids, especially those that have collected in large quantity in the serous cavities, have been often submitted to analysis. Of these analyses, I will only quote so many as are essential to the clear under- standing of their chemical relations,* and for their better comparison with the normal serum of the blood. l a s 4 » 6 7 •Serum of the Hydrocele.

These analyses, conducted in different ways, and therefore not admit- ting of close comparison, clearly show the great similarity between the serum of the blood and these dropsical fluids. In analysis 2, the drop- sical fluid is almost identical quantitatively with the serum ; in the * The most important chemical analyses of dropsical fluids may be found in the following works and Memoirs :—Berzelius’ Thicrchemie, 4th Edit. p. 198; Leop.

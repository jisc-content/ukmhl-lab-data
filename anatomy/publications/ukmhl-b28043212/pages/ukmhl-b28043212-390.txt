370 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. rhombic tablets, in which it separates from a solution of the gall-stone in hot alcohol. 2. Bile pigment (cholepyrrhin of Berzelius, biliphaein of Simon,) has a fiery, brownish-red colour, and is easily known by its reaction with nitric acid, which changes its colour first to green, then to blue, violet, and red ; the mixture lastly becoming colourless. It dissolves in boiling potash, producing a greenish-brown solution. Several modifications of this pigment occur which do not exhibit the characteristic reaction with nitric acid ; as for instance, 3. A dark brown, almost black pigment. 4. Other constituents of bile, as choleic acid, choleate of soda, and their modifications, bilifellinic acid, dyslysin, &c. 5. Mucus and epithelium of the gall-bladder and the biliary ducts. 6. Earthy salts, namely, carbonate of lime. 7. Margarin and the margarates. These constituents enter in different relations into the com- position of gall-stones. They are seldom all found united in one stone, and those which are composite are generally blended equally, or one constituent predominates over the others. Cholesterin is usually the preponderating substance; chole- pyrrhin rarely; in some few gall-stones the black pigment occurs in the largest quantity; while carbonate of lime is rarely thus met with. It is only in very few cases that gall-stones consist princi- pally of inspissated bile. Gall-stones likewise vary in their physical characters. As in urinary calculi, so also here, they may present every transi- tion, from a minute precipitate visible only by the microscope, to concretions of considerable magnitude. Hence we may distinguish between biliary deposits, biliary gravel, and gall- stones, which may be either consistent, or soft and doughy. The forms of these concretions are likewise variable; sometimes they occur as soft, amorphous masses; sometimes they have a

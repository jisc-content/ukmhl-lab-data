365 SALIVARY CONCRETIONS. concretions. It is only to the teeth, (and then from want of clean- liness,) that such an adhesion is possible, and thus we are able to explain the formation of the tartar which is deposited around the base of the gums, the body of the tooth, and between the teeth, exhibiting, when broken off, hardish particles of a .grayish-white colour. The formation of this tartar is pro- bably more dependant on an increased quantity of lime in the 'Secretion of the minute glands of the buccal cavity, than on a similar alteration in the saliva. An analysis made by S. Wright* will show how much the quantity of sthe calcareous salts of the saliva may be increased by morbid processes. fThe quantity of phosphate of lime which is only 0.6 in 1000 parts of (normal saliva was once found to be increased to 14. And in some I previous observations of the same author, the saliva was so calcareous (that it stiffened to a wliite chalky mass.

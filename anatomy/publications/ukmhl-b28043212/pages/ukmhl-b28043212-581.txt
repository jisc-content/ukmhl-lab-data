A woman aged about forty years had several tumours on the head an<l neck. She had been operated on four times, but the tumours on each occasion reappeared. In September 1839, she entered the hos- pital at Erlangen for the purpose of being again operated on. At this period there were several tumours about her head and neck. There was one situated on the right aide of the nose, extending from the root of this organ to the lower edge of the right ala, and so firmly attached to the subjacent bones that in performing the operation, it was necessary to remove the nasal bone, and the nasal process of the superior maxillary along with the tumour. There was another tumour seated at about the middle of the lower border of the inferior maxillary bone on the right side; it was in close connection with an artery and vein, so that it was necessary to tie the former in removing the tumour. There was a third tumour situated in the middle line of the neck, about midu’ay between the lower jaw Rud the larynx. Each of these tumours when extirpated, was found to be about the size of a small apple; they were irregularly spherical and tabulated, had a lardaceous consistence, and were each enclosed in a thin cyst or capsule. These tumours exactly re- sembled each other as regards their histological characters ; they 'were each composed of fibres identical with those of ordinary areolar tissue (a), and of fat-cells (b), which corresponded exactly with those observed in common adipose tissue. Although there were no blood- vessels distinctly observed, yet they were undoubtedly present, though ew in number, as is usually the case in adipose tissue; the fact of VOL. i. o o

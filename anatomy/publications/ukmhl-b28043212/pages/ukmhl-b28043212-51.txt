PNEUMATOSES. 31 probably to the latter category. Thus the vesicles of air in the vessels of the arachnoid, if they actually existed during life, and whilst the circulation was still proceeding, would, in accordance with the ordinary laws of physics, be conveyed with the blood to the heart. We have thus shown, that very many of the accumulations of air that have been described as occurring in the body, may be explained on physical and chemical grounds. There remain, however, other cases that do not admit of explanation on these grounds, and we are almost led to add, that 3. Gases may be actually secreted by different parts of the body. Thus, Magendie and Girardin assert that, on confining a portion of the intestine of a live dog between two ligatures, in the course of some hours the included portion was found full of air, which escaped with a hissing sound on making an incision.* In the intestinal canal of swine we sometimes meet with considerable accumulations of gas between the layers forming the walls of the bowels. Sir Francis Smithf has described an interesting case of the development of gas in man, which deserves a full notice. He states—“ On the 1 “2th of May, 1840, I was consulted by a gentleman, who told me that he often suffered from an enormous development of gas in the stomach, which he discharged by eructation: that he likewise, occasionally, experienced a development of gas from the bladder, and that his skin acted in a similar manner, as he had observed in the bath. On the morning of the 15th, I found my patient in a bath at 79° F. His breast, shoulders, abdomen, and hands, were literally covered with minute bubbles of gas. On being questioned, the attendant at the bath stated that he had never previously witnessed any * Magendie et Girardin, Recherches physiolog. sur les gaz intes- tin.

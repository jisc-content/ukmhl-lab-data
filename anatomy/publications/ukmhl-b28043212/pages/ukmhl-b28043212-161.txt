PUS. 141 ::’ound in the scrum, altogether independent of the pus- rcorpuscles. Substances which coagulate fluid albumen, such as metal- ic salts, tincture of iodine, alcohol, &c., render the pus- corpuscles opaque, a sign that they are infiltrated with an rulbuminous fluid. Saliva, mucus, urine, blood, and other animal fluids, do foot as a general rule produce any very essential change in the jppus-corpuscles; bile, however, seems to break them up, pos- sibly in consequence of its containing soda. Boiled with concentrated hydrochloric acid, pus-corpuscles react in the same manner as the protein-compounds, forming jaa violet coloured fluid. From these reactions we may conclude that pus-coqmscles i consist of several substances differing in their chemical eha- rracters, and we can distinguish: 1. The substance of the capsule, which is soluble in solutions of the caustic alkalies and their carbonates, of borax, and for the greater part, in saline solutions, as those of hvdroclvloratc of ammonia, nitrate of potash, &c., and in part soluble in dilute acids, as acetic acid. It forms the wall and a portion of the contents of the cell, and is doubtless a protein-com- jpound, very similar to, and probably identical with that modification of albumen which is precipitable by water, and is again dissolved on the addition of neutral salts or acetic acid.* 2. The substance of the nucleus, insoluble in acetic acid, swelling in saline solutions, and dissolving in solutions of borax, the caustic alkalies and their carbonates. This like- wise is a protein-compound, and is probably identical with the modified form of coagulated fibrin which swells in a 'Saline solution.! 3. Tin- substance of which the minute molecules consist, * Ijc-hmann and Me«scr.«chmidt’s a fibrin. 1 Lehmann and Mc^serschtnidt’s b fibrin.

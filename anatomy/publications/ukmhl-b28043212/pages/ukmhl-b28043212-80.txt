60 PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. body after death, just as they are observed during life when blood has been taken by venesection or other means; and yet, until recently, the statements of most authors respecting these changes are extremely indefinite and unsatisfactory, ren- dering it alike difficult to attach any certain meaning to their facts, or to discover their causes or signification. Moreover, there is hardly another department in the whole range ot medical science which has been so frequently used as a foundation for false hypotheses and theories relating to pathology and therapeutics—hardly another on which the majority ot the profession entertain such obscure views and vague ideas as on the pathological changes ot the blood. Hence, on this subject, the necessity for thoroughly determining the rigid and exact truth is doubly necessary. The above changes may be arranged under two divisions, in accordance with the means requisite for their detection ; firstly, such as are directly obvious to the senses, and are especially noticed in pathologico-anatomical researches on the dead body. These are principally modifications in its physical characters, as in the colour, consistence, or nature of the coagulation. Secondly, such as for their detection re- quire certain processes, often of a complicated nature—as most of the deviations of a chemical character. In accordance with the plan stated in my Introduction, 1 shall say nothing of the physiological or vital phenomena of the blood. But the changes in the blood which are recognizable by the senses, belong strictly to pathological anatomy, and with respect to the chemical changes, I certainly think that the most important, if they are suffi- ciently confirmed, should not he excluded, even if they appertain less to pathological anatomy than to chemistry. But it is the task, and fortu- nately also the tendency of the present day, to unite these two sciences.

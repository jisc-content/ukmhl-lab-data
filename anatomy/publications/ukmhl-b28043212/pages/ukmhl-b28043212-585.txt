565 EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. PLATE VIII. CARCINOMA SCIRRHCS COLLOID. Fig. l—3. Scirrhus of the testicle. Magnified 220 diameters. 1 he extirpated testis was of the size of a goose-egg, and retained its jierfectly oval form, without any inequalities or excrescences. ITie surface turned towards the tunica vaginalis was smooth, and only in parts united with that membrane. The epididymis was distinct, and did not appear to be enlarged. On cutting through the testis, its whole mass was seen to have been affected by an uniform change. It was very firm, cartilaginous, and of a white colour. A microscopic examination exhibited the following results. Small masses that hail been pared from a recent section of the tumour and moistened in water consisted entirely of an accumulation of cells. (Fig. 1.) These were very pale, varying in size and form, being sometimes roundish (a), sometimes oval (A), or caudate (J), or again of entirely irregular form. The greater number exhibited nuclei [a. A,), and in some a nucleolus was visible in the nucleus (c, A) ; few were devoid of nuclei. On some, fat-globules were observed (g). Be- tween these cells there were perceived nuclei with or without nu- cleoli (d). In places there appeared between the cells smaller or larger portions of dark granules—fat granules (e) ; finally, at certain spots, isolated nodules were observed (Fig. 3. B.) consisting of indistinct fibrous capsules, containing the cells already described. On cutting off small portions of the tumour with scissors, and placing them under the microscojje, having moistened them with water, and drawn them into fibres by means of fine needles, the pale cells of varying size and shape, which we have already described, were observed. On treating them with acetic acid, they disappeared, leaving only the nuclei and nucleoli. On removing these cells as much as possible by constant washing, a tissue remained composed of

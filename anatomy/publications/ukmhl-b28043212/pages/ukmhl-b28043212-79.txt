59 PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. CHAPTER III. PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. The blood of the human body may in various ways deviate from its normal condition. The following may be regarded as the most important deviations: 1. Its physical and chemical characters may undergo alteration. It may be either thinner or thicker than usual, and its colour may be affected. The blood-corpuscles may appear changed. The proportion of its constituents to each other may be altered, and it may contain matter not nor- mally existing in it, as sugar, free lactic acid, &c. 2. Its quantity may be increased (hyperaemia or polyhoemia) or diminished (anaemia or hy premia). This increase or diminu- tion may either be general, extending to the whole organism, or local, and restricted to particular parts of the body. 3. It may be effused in consequence of laceration of the blood-vessels, into the interstices of the parenchyma of certain organs, or into some of the cavities of the body, con- stituting extravasation. 4. The hrematin may, by a process of decomposition, be- come dissolved, and then be imbibed bv the tissues. 1. PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHANGES OV THE BLOOD. Deviations in the physical and chemical characters of the blood are of very frequent occurrence. We find them in the

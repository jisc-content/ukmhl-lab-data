EXPLANATION O* THE PLATES. PLATE II. INFLAMMATION, FJBHINOU8 KXLDATION, AND THKItt DKVELOFMKNT. Fio. 1. A piece of inflamed mucous membrane from the trachea of a yount, man who died from febris mucosa. The respiratory mucous membrane was especially attacked by the disease ; during life there had been difficult respiration, rhonckus sibilans in both lungs, and moderate exjiectoration, containing pus and mucus streaked with blood. On dissection, the mucous membrane of the trachea was found to be much reddened; the colour passing into a violet tint, but on exposure to air soon changing to a clear red. (A) exhibits a piece of tins mucous membrane, as it appeared to the naked eye. Seen under a power of 220 diameters, normal ciliated epithelium was visible, the separate cells being for the most jÂ«xrt rubbed off, so hat the surface of the mucous membrane appeared free. (B) shews t lc free surface of the mucous membrane after the epithelium had been removed. Magnified 220 diameters. We saw a very thick vascular network, the vessels having a larger diameter than usual, and being entirely filled with stagnant blood, which was, however, still fl.OWt;d /'0m ftem on pressure. On examining this cupelled blood, the blood-corpuscles were seen to be little changed in heir form ; they were more globular than usual, and had lost the cup. like depression m their centre (Fig. 1. **). The>acular reticulations were so close, that they in some places entirely covered the paren- chyma of the mucous membrane; and where the latter is visible it was colourless, or of a family brown tint, and had the usual apueir- aace of normal mucous membrane. r Fio. 2-5 illustrate different stages of development of effused and conguluted fibrin.

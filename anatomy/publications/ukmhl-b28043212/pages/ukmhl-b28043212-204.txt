184 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. membrane might find a practical application. I have never met with a case tending to give either of these explanations a greater degree of probability than the other. The law of analogous formation appears to he here so far in force, as, that pathological fat-cells are most frequently formed in those parts where in the normal condition an accumulation of fat exists, as we shall show when we speak of fatty tumours. The chemical elements of morbidly formed fat are the same as those of normal fat. Olein is the prevailing element in fluid, and margarin and cholesterin in solid fat. Sometimes hutyrin is found in small quantities, recognizable by the peculiar odour of butyric acid, which it evolves on becoming rancid. Whether serolin, and the brain-fats, of which we know very little, occur in morbid formations is unknown. EPIGENESIS OF MUSCULAR TISSUE. The normal muscles are divided into those containing simple, non-striated fibres, and those consisting of compound striated, primitive fasciculi. The same division holds, also, with regard to morbidly formed, muscular substance. a. Muscles with compound, striated, primitive fasciculi. To these belong, in the normal body, the voluntary muscles of the trunk, head, and extremities, and the muscular walls of the heart.* There is no doubt that muscular sub- stance of this kind may be produced by a morbid process, but this can only be argued from consequences, and not directly observed. This epigenesis always consists in a hjpcitiophy of muscular substance existing in the normal condition, and is of most frequent occurrence in the heart. It appears that the volume of the muscles is increased without the single primitive fasciculi gaining in thickness; hence, it must be concluded that their number is increased; that is, that new * See Henleâ€™s Allgem.

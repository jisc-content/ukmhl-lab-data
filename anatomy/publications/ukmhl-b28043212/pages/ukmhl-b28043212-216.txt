196 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. blood-pigment is so easily dissolved, when it is so difficult of extraction in normal htematin, as Mulder* has shown to be the case. Probably the preceding decomposition of the blood plays an important part in this stage of the pro- cess. There can be no doubt but that the second kind of morbid pigment arises from the blood, and, further, from its colouiing ; matter. Many writers, amongst whom Bruch is found, trace the origin of all kinds of granular pigment to the colour- j ing matter of the blood. This is not impossible, but it can be nothing more than a supposition. For that both are coloured in the same way is no proof that the one arises from the 1 other. We arc acquainted with many examples in zoo- chemistry where colourless matters give rise to coloured pro- ducts ; and it is highly probable that in the formation of blood in the embryo, the hsematin arises from colourless mattci. I have made a number of experiments by injecting blood into the abdominal cavity of animals, with and without the addition of sulphuretted hydrogen and hydrosulphate of ammonia, in order to convert it into granular pigment; but all my attempts have been unsuccessful, nor was I more fortunate in producing even a trace of granular pigment j by treating either fresh or putrid blood with various reagents. The generality of writers designate the pathological epigenesis j of granular pigment by the general name of melanosis. But the three kinds above described must each have dis- j tinct names. In the following pages I shall, therefore, j designate the first kind as true melanosis, and the two last 1 which depend upon chemical changes in the blood-pigment, and on the formation of sulphuret of iron, I shall name false or pseudo-melanoses. Gluge laughs at this distinction, and observes that the latter has * Marchand u. Erdmannâ€™s Journal fur praktische Chemie, 1844 No. xi. p. 186, &c.

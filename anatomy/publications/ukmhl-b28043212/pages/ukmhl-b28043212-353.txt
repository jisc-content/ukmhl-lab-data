The same is the case with fimgoid growths, which may arise from any dis- charging tumour, ulcer, &c. We sh;ill have more to say in relation to these tumours in the second volume. SPECIAL RELATIONS OF UNORGANIZED PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. The unorganized epigeneses occurring in the human body are very numerous, and present many varieties. In the fid- lowing pages, devoted to their special consideration, we shall commence with certain general considerations, beginning with their elementary relation All these forms arise from fluids—mother-liquids, holding the matter of which the future deposit is composed, in a state of chemical solution. Nearly every fluid in the body may act as a mother-liquid, since they all contain matter which, under certain conditions, may be separated in a solid form. The conditions for this separation are in all respects identical with those which chemistry teaches us to recognize in relation to the separation of solid bodies from their solutions, that is to say, the deposits invariably follow chemical law’s. As a general rule, the separation of a substance from a * Regarding the histological relations of polypi, consult the treatise of Frerichs, de Polyporum Structuru Pcnitiori.

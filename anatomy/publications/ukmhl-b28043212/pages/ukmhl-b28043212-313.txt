CANCER. 293 other structures, namely into fibres, and therefore only to be regarded as cells in a transition state — developmental or fibre-cells. a. The characteristic cancer-cells present extreme variations, ; from the simple cytoblast through every modification of which a simple cell is capable, up to highly developed cellular ' forms—varieties which in every case depend for the most part '°n the degree of development of the primary cells, and are sometimes transitory, and sometimes persistent stages of development. The primary forms of these cells present no peculiarity. The nuclei vary from the 450th to the 250th of a line in diameter, are insoluble in acetic acid, and often ‘ contain nucleoli ;* the cells are nucleated and round, or oval, vary trom the 300th to the 100th of a line in diameter,+ entirely dissolve on the addition of the caustic alkalies, and disappear, with the exception of their nuclei, on the addition > of acetic acid. Still more characteristic of carcinomatous tumours are the i cellular forms, which frequently, but not invariably are asso- ciated with the above primary forms, and only rarely occur independently of them. To this class belong: «. Peculiarly formed, caudate, ramifying cells, j /3. Cells containing a large number of nucl i (from two to twenty or thirty) or enclosing in their interior perfect young * cells.ji lhey are usually of considerable size, varying from the 100th to the 30th, or even 20th of a line in diameter. y. Cells with a very thick wall, exhibiting a double con- tour.^ ♦ See Plate n. fig. 8 b, 9 b; Plate vm.

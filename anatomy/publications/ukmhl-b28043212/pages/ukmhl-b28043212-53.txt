DROPSIES. 33 CHAPTER II. ABNORMAL COLLECTION OF AQUEOUS FLUIDS.—DROPSIES. Morbid collections of aqueous fluids in the body are designated by the general terms, hydrops, or dropsy. Drop- sies are of very frequent occurrence, and in an anatomico- pathological point of view, present many varieties dependant on the region of the body in which the fluid has collected, on its action on the adjacent parts, and, finally, on the chemical properties and mode of origin of the fluid. 1. The dropsical fluid may be situated in one of the serous cavities of the body, and in such cases it often amounts to a very considerable quantity.—This class of dropsies has been further divided into dropsy of the pleura (hydrothorax), dropsy of the pericardium (hydrops pericardii), dropsy of the peritoneal sac (hydrops ascites), dropsy of the tunica vaginalis testis (hydrocele), dropsy in the cavity of the cranium (hydrocephalus), dropsy of the spinal canal (hydro- rhachis), and of the eye (hydrophthalmus). In these cases the fluid usually occurs free, and, in accord- ance with the laws of gravity, settles in the most dependant part of the serous sac. It is, however, occasionally enclosed in recently formed membranous sacs. It is then termed encysted dropsy (hydrops saccatus). 2. The fluid may be effused within the parenchyma of certain organs. This condition is known as oedema; its ordinary position is the cellular tissue beneath the skin, between the muscles,

INTRODUCTION. 3 Medicine has a double signification ; it is at once a science and an art. Medicine, as an art, has a practical value in relation to life, and is therefore regarded by the mass ot its disciples as of the highest importance. But it is an error, and an indication of little intelligence to regard the practical as the only important part of medicine, and the scientific as a mere superfluous decoration, as a brilliant but useless ornament. 1 here are crafts in which the manual dexterity acquired by long prac- tice seems to suffice for practical purposes independently ot all scientific inquiry; yet even in these cases, the immeasurable strides with which these arts have recently progressed, afford the most convincing proof that the application of scientific principles to even the simplest operations, which were supposed to be incapable of improvement, has been productive of the happiest results. In medicine such narrow views must be rejected, for they would tend to produce the blind self-esteem which regards ancient formulae and mechanically learned pro- cesses as sufficient to heal all diseases ; or else they would excite doubts regarding the whole science of medicine and deny its power in toto, because there are difficulties and obscurities which exceed its power of solution. Each of these views regarding the healing art is equally erroneous; the directions for medical treatment given to us by the various schools are yet far from sufficient, and every conscientious physician will confess that those unworthy disciples of Esculapius, who, with self-sufficient confidence, publish their own methods of cure as alone true and infallible, are richly deserving of the scorn and contempt which satire from the earliest ages has heaped upon them. Equally mischievous and deplorable is medical scepticism. It is true that the science is yet far from being in a condition to answer all the intricate questions which the varied character of disease may suggest; that time is still far distant, indeed it may never arise ; yet the science still remains, and confidence in its results is the sole prop on which the practice of the physician can rest.

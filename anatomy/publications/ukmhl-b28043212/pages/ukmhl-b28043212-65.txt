45 DROPSIES. The serous membranes enclosing the fluid are usually (and always when the disease is of any duration) loosened (avfrjelockert), pale, dull, and opaque. In cavities with yielding walls, fluctuation may be detected by percussion. In infiltration of the tissues, there is a soft, pasty, shining tumidity, which pits on pressure of the finger. On making a puncture or incision, the fluid escapes either by drops, or in a stream, in proportion to the quantity present. The fluid occurs in the first place in the interstices between the elementary parts of the tissues, which imbibe it and assume a less compact and more flaccid appearance than in the normal condition In recent cases, that is to say, when the venous dilatation that has caused the dropsy has only occurred shortly before death, the dropsical organs appear to be reddened (as is frequently noticed in pulmonary oedema) ; usually, however, they are pale, and only the larger veins appear to contain much blood. More on this subject will be found in the second part when speaking of the separate organs. 2. FIBRINOUS DROPSY. This species of dropsy, distinguished by the circumstance of the effusion containing dissolved fibrin, is not rare, being of more frequent occurrence than the preceding, although hitherto it has seldom been described,* and its signification has not been properly interpreted. It has never hitherto been correctly distinguished from serous dropsy, and has conse- quently never had a special name assigned to it. Like serous dropsy, it may occur either in serous cavities (as in the pleura, * Cases in which this form is described are given by: Schwann and Magnus, in Muller’s Archiv. 1838, p. 95, &c.; Delaharpe, in Archives g£n6r. de Med. Juin, 1842 ; Scherer, Unters. z. Patholog. p. 106—110; or Simon, op. cit. v. ii. p. 491, &c.; Gluge, Anat. mik. Unters. 1838, p. 74 ; Quevenne, Journal de Pharmacie, Nov. 1837. I have myself observed a very large number.

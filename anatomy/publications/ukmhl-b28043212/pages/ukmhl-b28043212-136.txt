PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 116 minimum, in the lower animals where whole organs can be reproduced, this power is much more energetic. b. In proportion as the physiological properties of the parent-tissue deviate from the normal type, so much the more heterogeneous will be the epigenesis. 1 hus in gangrenous parts the exudation admits of no normal development; and the same is the case in parts in which the nerves have been divided. In structures which have been changed by chronic inflammation, or of which the physiological properties of the elementary parts differ for any reason from the normal type, pathological epigeneses are produced distinct from those that occur in healthy parts. The cytoblastema on the one hand, and the pre-existing tissues on the other, are each factors influencing the formation of organized morbid products, and it is on their different pro- perties that these epigeneses are dependant both for their mode of formation, and for their general characters. Having dismissed these questions, let us now advcit to the processes that take place in these morbid developments. Schwann in confirmation, of his cellular theory,* has made the remark, that he has observed its application to a large number of morbid products. Since that date numerous observations have been published which support this view. Schwann’s theory of cellular formation has, during the last few years, been attacked from many quarters, or at ^ least adopted with modifications, as by Arnold, Henle, and \ ogt,f while Reichert+ has stood forth as its advocate. According to Schwann, development is always dependant on a formation . of cells in an amorphous cytoblastema, and the formation * Mikrosk.

47 DROPSIES. The coagulation of the tibrin sometimes takes place in the body during life, as we shall presently show. The coagulation out of the body, to which we have already referred, varies considerably in the time of its occurrence ; sometimes taking place in an hour, in other cases, not until the lapse of twelve, or even twenty-four hours. Moreover, Delaharpe (op. cit.) has occasionally observed the fibrinous clot re-dis- solve in the fluid. The coagulated fibrin appears under the microscope ns a perfectly amorphous mass, and devoid of any traces of cellular structure. In its chemical composition, this fluid is identical with the plasma of the blood ; that is to say, with the blood indepen- dently of its corpuscles; it is scrum, or the fluid of serous dropsy, with dissolved fibrin. By chemical analysis, we find that it contains : water, dissolved fibrin and albumen, fat, extractive matters, and salts (chloride of sodium, carbonate (?) and phosphate of soda, sulphate of potash, phosphates of lime and magnesia, carbonate (?) of lime, and lactates). The similarity of the fluid to the plasma of the blood occasionally extends even to their quantitative composition; usually, however, the dropsical fluid is the richer in water, and contains a less amount of organic constituents—albumen and tibrin. It is very seldom that this rule is reversed. In this point, therefore, there is the same relation as between the fluid of serous dropsy and the serum of the blood. In order to give a clear view of these relations, I shall communicate a few analyses, preceded by a formula representing the mean composition of the plasma of the blood. 1000 parts of fluid contain : 1 3 3 Plasma of Empyema.

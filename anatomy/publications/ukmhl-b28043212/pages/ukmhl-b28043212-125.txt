PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 105 intrusted by urinary sediments, and probably the regular spherical concretions of lime found in the choroid plexus ; are formed in a similar way by incrustation of the cells.* Intimate as the connexion between these depositions and organized forms sometimes appears to be, the adhesion is never chemical, but merely mechanical, and on removing the unorganized structures, either mechanically or chemically, the organized parts stand forth in their original normal form. It is deserving of especial mention, that the production of many unorganized formations is dependant on the develop- ment of a new secreting organ, previously created by a morbid process. In illustration, we may mention the deposition of cry stallized cholesterin in encysted tumours, especially in that form termed by Cruveilhier the laminated nacreous tumor, where the deposition is so abundant, that the whole con- tents form a connected and often tolerably firm crystalline mass. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORGANIZED PATHOLOGICAL FORMATIONS. The development of organized morbid tissues is depen- dant on laws differing essentially from the chemical laws already considered. The difference is obvious even in the formative material. It is not every' mother-liquid that can act as a cytoblastema for organized products. The cytoblastema is usually fiuid; it may, however, be solid, but in this case it must of necessity be amorphous, that is, it must not exhibit either a definite organized appearance, or crystallization. The only solid cytoblastema which has yet been noticed in relation to morbid products is coagulated fibrin in its amorphous condition and permeated with water, in the state, for instance, in which it occurs in inflammatory exudations. But even this blastema was originally fluid, and * Compare Henleâ€™s A%em. Anatomic, p. 10.

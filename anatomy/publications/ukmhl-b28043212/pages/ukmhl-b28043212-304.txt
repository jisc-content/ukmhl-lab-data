PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 284 with the elements of tubercle. After the process of softening these elements mix with the liquefied tubercular mass, and thus increase the number of the constituents of the detritus deposited by it. Whether the cytoblastema of these peripheral formations is identical with, or distinct from that of the tubercular matter itself, this much is certain, that the latter can exert no great influence on it, and that its generative power is very small. This is an essential difference between tubercu- lar matter and the more highly organized pseudo-plasmata. We shall see that they possess this capacity in a high degree, and that the cytoblastema separated in their neighbourhood, is excited to analogous development; while in tubercles this is not the case, or at most only occurs occasionally to a slight degree. The extension of the tubercular deposit is dependant only on the unknown cause which, in the first instance gave rise to it (the tuberculous diathesis). For this reason tubercles frequently heal without any artificial aid, when this tendency, and, at the same time, the occurrence of the deposition terminate. The cure is effected, either by the cavity becoming filled by the formation of a cicatrix, by its being invested by newly formed membrane (mucous membrane with epithelium), by the tubercular mass becoming resorbed, or finally by its becoming converted into a concretion by the deposition of calcareous salts. The details of these processes are different in the various organs, and we shall enter with more minuteness into the subject in the special part, in the chapter on the morbid anatomy of the lungs. , This deposition occurs most frequently in the lungs and the lymphatic glands, but likewise in the kidneys, liver, spleen, mucous membranes, external skin, hones, and almost every part of the body. . The period intervening between deposition and softening,

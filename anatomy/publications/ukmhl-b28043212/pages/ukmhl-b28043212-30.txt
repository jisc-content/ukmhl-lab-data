10 INTRODUCTON. hours, a very superficial knowledge of pathological anatomy would show the folly of such an assertion. Let us now turn to the means by which a knowledge of pathological anatomy may be attained. The study of those morbid changes to which the various parts of the body are liable, depends on a thorough previous knowledge of their normal relations; hence pathological ana- tomy requires a perfect knowledge of the structure of the healthy body, and of a special department of physiology (de usu partiumâ– ) in order to be able to estimate the influence which any morbid alteration of an organ impresses on its function. Our science must not merely study the coarser changes, such as are visible to the unaided eye; but also those finer modifications affecting elementary tissues, visible only by the microscope; hence the necessity for an accurate know- ledge of general anatomy or histology. Histology and descriptive anatomy are most intimately connected with pathological anatomy; they unite to form the necessary data for its successful cultivation; and further, there exists a boundary in common to all three, which they simultaneously occupy and cultivate. Thus, for example, certain varieties in the form and position of different parts of the body, as of the vessels, may be ranged under either normal or pathological anatomy; moreover, the theory of the development of most of the tissues is the same in pathological as in normal his- tology. In order to understand those deviations from the normal type which occur in the foetal condition, pathological anatomy demands an accurate previous knowledge of the law of development; indeed there are many points in which these two sciences closely approach each other. . In the establishment of its own observations, pathological anatomy requires not merely the theoretical knowledge already alluded to, but also the same manual dexterity which is needed in the practical exercise of normal anatomy, namely, skill in dissection, which can be much more readily acquired by prac-

516 MALFORMATIONS. 3. They may be attached at the forehead (didymus symphyometopus, Barkow—metopages, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, vol. in. p. 56). Cases belonging to this group are very rare in man. 4. The duplication may simultaneously affect the upper and lower ends of the body, the two bodies being amalga mated in the middle. a. The duplication may affect, superiorly, the face, and inferiority, the anterior pelvic region (diprosopus diwdceus, Barkow; tetrascelus in part, Gurlt). It does not occur in the human subject: cases which have occurred in animals have been collected by Barkow, vol. II. p. 43. b. The duplication may affect, superiorly, the face, andinfe- riorly, the lower part of the body (diprosopus dihypo gastrins, Barkow; tetrascelus in part, Gurlt); four lower extremities are here always present. Frequently observed in man. See Barkow, vol. ii. p. 43. c. The duplication and separation may affect, superiorly, the vertex, and inferiorly, the parts from the umbilicus down- wards (dicoryphus dihypogastrius, Barkow octopus synap- teocephalus, Gurlt). Barkow, vol. ii. p. 44; vol. i. pi. ii. fig. 1. Geoffroy St. Hilaire terms this form, hemipages (vol. in. p. 104). d. The head and neck superiorly, and the lower half of the body from the umbilicus downwards, may be doubled and separated ; the amalgamation taking place on the thorax and upper part of the abdomen, either on the anterior sur- faces of the bodies, or more laterally (thoracodidymus, Gurlt; dicephalus dihypogastrius, and, as a higher degree, didymus symphyothoraccepigastrius, Barkow. Both, but especially Barkow’s second form, arc not unfrequent in the human subject. See cases in Barkow, vol. u. p. 44, &c.; Cruveilhier, Anat. pathol. livr. xxv. pi. v.; Otto, p. 170, &c.; and in Geoffroy St. Hilaire, who separates these cases into two genera : 1. Sternopages, with anterior amalgamation (vol. in. p. 93, &c.) 2. Ectopages, with lateral amalgamation (vol. in. p. 98, &c.) e. There may be almost complete duplication, with separa- tion of the two bodies, which arc amalgamated only in the

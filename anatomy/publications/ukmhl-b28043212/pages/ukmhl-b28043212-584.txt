564 EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. channelling, separate into numerous fibres. G, a portion of the mature fibres of areolar tissue. On the addition of acetic acid, a portion of the mass became transparent; numerous isolated nuclei were then seen, as well as many unaltered fibres, in a semi-amorphous mass. The arrangement of the fibres appeared to be generally circular or spherical. The entire polypus was invested with a normal mucous membrane, the surface of which was protected by several layers of pavement- epithelium. No ciliated epithelium could be observed Fig 3*. A, represents a patch of non-nucleated epithelial cells : B, of nucleated epithelium. Both forms occurred at different parts of the surface of the tumour. All the epithelial cells had puckered appearance. Magnified 220 diameters. Fig. 4. Fibrous tumour of the skin (a wart).

After extirpation it appeared smooth, of the size an orm lentil, covered with normal epidermis, and slightly corrugate . its true structure. The matter scraped from the surface of the wart formed a white, dirty powder, which, under the microscope, was seen toTonsist of very thin, roundish, oval, or angular scales, devoid o nuclei (A a). They were in every respect identical l^ceUs cells forming the external layer of normal epiderm which formed the interior epidermic layers of the t p-cnerallv smaller and less flat, and exhibited decided nuclei (A. ). HTcftLTnvestment of the tumour consisted of normal epidermis. Thelnterior of the wart was formed of a very dense fibrous tissue (B), and in some spots undulating bundles of caudate fibre* “S be seen on many of which nuclei were perceptible (C).

PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 304 putrefaction, of which the conditions have not yet been accurately investigated ; but—as in that case—probably are a large quantity of the product of the softening, impeded metamorphosis in the surrounding parts, and an admixture of matter inducing putrefaction—namely blood. Until the commencement of the ichorous discharge, the softening is usually restricted to the cellular portions; at the same time the solid parts, namely the fibres and blood-vessels, which in themselves have no tendency to soften, undergo putrefac- tion and disintegration through the influence ot the ichor; their destruction is, however, usually very gradual. In this stage, a section of those forms of cancer which contain fibres presents a very peculiar appearance. It exhibits irregular cavities filled with ichor, whose walls are very tough, often as hard as cartilage, and are composed of fibres, presenting, as it were, a corroded appearance. Isolated fibrous bundles frequently softened and half destroyed at their superficies pro- ject into the cavities, or extend across them in the form of rafters or arches. We sometimes discover the open mouths of corroded blood-vessels; in these cases effused blood, coagulated in clots or mixed with ichor, fills the cavities. The above series of processes occurring in the development of cancer, occupy very different periods of time in different cases; they always require several weeks or months, and sometimes several years. In proportion to the extent of cellular structure in a case of cancer, so much the more quickly does the process of development attain its termination, and it has long been remarked that the forms of cancer, in which cells predominate, (encephaloid) usually run their course and terminate fatally in about as many months as those forms in which fibres predominate (scirrhus) require years. Simultaneously with the process of development the cance- rous tumour undergoes other changes; it increases to such a degree, that from a very limited origin it often becomes distributed over a large space, occupying one or even se\er<

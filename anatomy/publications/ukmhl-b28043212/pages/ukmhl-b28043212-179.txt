Where imperfectly formed granular cells occur together with the ele- mentary granules previously described, the diagnosis of the individual corpuscles becomes almost impossible. Having thus described the morphological and chemical constitution of the different fluids embraced under the some- what general name of pus, we may now take a genend view of the formative relations, and the pathological importance of these morbid products. Pathological anatomy has, in this respect, a much more difficult office than pathology, for the latter is able to follow the entire series of processes from their first appearance in the vascular system to the perfect formation of these products, and to consider them in their mutual relations; whilst the former is often confined to the observation of results, which must he retraced with many interruptions and obscurities in the connecting links. I refer, therefore, for the completion of this fragmentary outline to my article on “ Inflammation and its Results,”* and to the rigidly critical development of inflammation and its results by Henle.f We shall return in a future page to the connection of these processes. Suppuration consists essentially in the fact that the parts of the exuded plasma capable of such formation, undergo a peculiar organization—an organization on which the cha- racter of pus is dependant, and which distinguishes it from other morbid products. When this capability of organization in the plasma is clearly manifested, true pus-corpuscles, or completely formed granular cells occur; when it is less strongly declared, we observe either pus-corpuscles, or simply accumulations of elementary granules. These elementary types—true pus-corpuscles, abnormal pus-corpuscles, granu- * Wagner’s Handwbrterbuch der Physiologic, vol. i. 1 Zeitschrift f. rationelle Medicin, vol. n.

574 EXPLANATION OF TIIK PLATES. It shewed under the microscope, besides normal hepatic cells, pale cancer cells, similar to those depicted in Fig. 4, D, and numerous caudate cells (Fig. 9, 0—scirrhous fibres in the act of development.) When these elements were perfectly removed, a tolerably large and firm mass remained. This was whitish, compact, and not easily separable into fibres. It, in part, formed perfectly amorphous un- defined spherical particles, varying in size from the 100th to the 20th of a line in diameter, and, at other places, fibrous masses in which the scirrhus fibres were more or less plainly to be seen. The mass became quite pale in acetic acid, disappearing almost entirely, and shewing only a few nuclei. Hence the blastema appeared to be still almost entirely unorganized. The mass lying upon the aorta had the same appearance as the scirrhus of the liver. It was firm, and a section was reddish brown with white specks : the separate portions were roundish, nodular, and in some cases softened in the centre. A microscopic investigation shewed distinct blood-vessels, much fat, (partly in glo- bules, partly in granules, and crystals of cholesterin,) isolated cells with nuclei, and, as a stroma, a firm compact mass, which, acting in part as a blastema, contained cells and nuclei, and in part was perfectly amorphous, or merely exhibited an imperfect formation of large cells with thick walls (Fig. 9, B). In some places the amorphous stroma of the tissue was composed of spherical masses from the 10th part of a line in diameter, or even less, exhibiting, m their interior, decided traces of incipient cell-formation (as in Fig. 9, B). . . m 1 _ C,. 4-1 _ On treating them with acetic acid, they became perfectly trans- parent, and exhibited at spots elongated nuclei, similar to those occurring in the fibres of organic muscle—hence they were fibres in r>f 4f»rplnr>ment. nified 100 diameters.

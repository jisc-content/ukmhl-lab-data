384 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. based on external, and for the most part, fortuitous and unessential characters. The manner in which these concretions are formed being different in individual cases, it is not easy to deduce any general law on the subject; however, in most cases the following remarks will be found to approximate tolerably closely to the truth. All the vascular tissues of the body are infiltrated by a fluid which proceeding from the vessels, and consequently from the blood, is being continuously renewed, since a portion is being continuously removed by the lymphatics, and further, because it is subjected to a continuous metamorphosis of its con- stituents by endosmosis with the contents of the vessels. To this fluid we may apply the term general nutrient fluid, although it is not always the same, but exhibits many differences, not only in different parts of the body, but also in the same part at different times. In general this fluid resembles the liquor sanguinis, and its changes are principally only qualitative. Some of its constituents under certain conditions become insoluble, and separate as precipitates; these most commonly are the earthy salts—the phosphate and carbonate of lime, ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate, carbonate of magnesia, and silica; more rarely, the salts soluble in water—chloride of sodium, phosphate and sulphate of soda, and sulphate of lime, fats—as for instance, cholesterin, and very rarely, some other salts of difficult solubility in water—as urate of soda. The conditions which must be fulfilled in order to give rise to the separation of these substances from the general nutrient fluid, are identical with those already described in our remarks on the individual precipitates. It is, however, very difficult in individual cases, to recognize the acting causes.. One fiequent cause is an extraordinary relative augmentation of ceitam substances in the blood, as when concretions are formed not only at isolated spots, but in considerable number, and over a great part of the system, as, for instance, in the extensive ossification of the arteries, so commonly observ ed in ag

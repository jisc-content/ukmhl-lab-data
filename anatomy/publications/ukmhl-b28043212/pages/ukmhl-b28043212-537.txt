Cases of this nature are rare; several are collected in Barkow, vol. u. p. 45, and in Geoffrey St. Hilaire,* who names this form Xipho- pagus. W e must here include the celebrated case of the Siamese twins; also a case described by Fanzago (Storia del mostro di due corpi, etc. Padova, 1803), with a beautiful illustration ; see also Otto, p. 169, &c. B. PARASITIC DOUBLE MONSTERS. MONSTERS BY IMPLANTATION. 1 he amalgamated bodies are here not equally developed, one being more or less atrophied, and either apparent externally on the more perfect individual, or so concealed under the skin or inclosed within the cavities of the bodv, that it is not outwardly visible. The cases belonging to this division arise either like perfect double malformation, by splitting of one germ, of which, how- ever, half becomes atrophied, or, compared to the other, is backward in its development—or two germs exist from the first (an ovum with two germinal vesicles, or two ova), which unite together, or of which the more developed one encloses within itself that which is less perfect. We may distinguish the following forms ot these malformations : LA perfect individual may bear on its head, not like the didymus symphyocephalus or cephalopages, a fully developed second individual, but only a head with traces of the rest of the body. It is very rare. Geoffiroy St. Hilaire, who has collected several of these cases (vol. in. p. 239. &c., aud pi. xx. fig. 3). names the form, epicoma. 2. On the head of a more or less perfectly developed foetus, attached either to the palate or the lower jaw, there may be very imperfect rudiments of a second head. Geoffrey St. Hilaire arranges (vol. hi. p. 250, &c., pi. xx. fig. 3.) »«sc rare cases m three genera; 1.

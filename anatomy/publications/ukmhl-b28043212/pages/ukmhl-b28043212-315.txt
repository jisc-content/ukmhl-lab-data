295 CANCER. in many cancerous tumours.* I think, however, that the cases in which they predominate belong more to non-malignant (fibrous) tumours than to actual cancer. 4. Fibres of various kinds form a further histolo- gical element of cancerous tumours. Some are perfectly identical with those of fibrous tumours ; these either resemble the fibres of areolar tissue, are very delicate, and vary in diameter from the 2000th to the 800th ot a line, or else they resemble the fibres of simple, non-striated muscular fibre, being thicker than the former, and varying in diameter from the 800th to the 300th of a line. Sometimes both these kinds of fibres are seen perfectly developed; in other cases the, formation of the fibres is less distinct, the whole mass having an almost amorphous appearance, as if the fibres were blended into one another—just as we have already seen in the amorphous variety of fibrous tumour. As in the case of fibrous tumour, the fibres arise sometime* from undoubted cells, and sometimes from an amorphous cytoblastema in- dependently of any regular cell-formation. These kinds of fibres mav be distinguished by their becoming pale on the addition of acetic acid, and frequently entirely disappearing, at least nothing but elongated oval nuclei remaining in their place.f The second kind of fibres occurring in cancer are identical with Henle’s nucleated fibres,J and with the fibres of elastic tissue. They frequently present a ramifying, sometimes a dichotomic arrangement, and art; chiefly to be distinguished from the preceding group by their behaviour with acetic acid— instead of disappearing, their outline becomes more clear and distinct.

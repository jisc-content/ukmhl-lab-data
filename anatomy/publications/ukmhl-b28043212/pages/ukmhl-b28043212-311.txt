291 CANCER. tumour, and cases frequently occur in which it cannot with certainty be determined whether a tumour belongs to the carcinomatous or fibrous group, that is to say, whether it be malignant or non-malignant. The malignancy depends here, as in the former class, on softening and a disintegration of the elements, commencing with the cellular structures, but gradually proceeding to the fibrous parts and the elementary tissues of the affected organ. The anatomical and histological relations of carcinomatous tumour exhibit the greatest variety; indeed, even in the same tumour, different parts often present very different characters. Their characters further vary with their stage of development. These tumours are sometimes soft, resembling cerebral substance ; sometimes firm, like lard ; and sometimes hard, like cartilage; sometimes they are highly vascular, and of a reddish tint; sometimes pale; sometimes they are dis- tinctly separated from the adjacent parts, whilst in other cases there is no line of demarcation between them and the surrounding tissues. Hence in a general consideration of the subject, these relations are of no value. Moreover the histological elements of individual carcino- matous tumours are very different, and arranged in various ways. I shall therefore notice them separately. In carcino- matous tumours there occur: 1. A firm, dense, amorphous substance, bearing a close resemblance to, and probably identical with coagulated fibrin. It is rendered transparent by acetic acid, and by ammonia and other caustic alkalies, and sometimes incloses molecular granules consisting of modified protein or fat. This substance is doubtless to be regarded as the solid cytoblastema of can- cer, and is subsequently converted into cells or fibres, which may sometimes be very clearly detected* It is characteristic ol a definite stage of the development of cancer, and is conse- * See Plate vm. fig. 9, a, b. u 2

A special consideration must be devoted to those morbid changes which originate not, as is for the most part the case with those hitherto described, after birth, but during fetal life, and which, consequently, the infant biings vsith it into the world. . These congenital changes may be reduced to two divisions, which, however, are not strictly separable from one another. Those belonging to the first division differ in no respect from the morbid changes already considered ; indeed, it has been already frequently mentioned, that certain tumours are occa- sionally formed in the fetus in exactly the same manner as , they arise after birth. This, for instance, was stated in relation to congenital telengiectasies, lipomata, encysted tumours, &c. These congenital changes, accordingly, present little or nothing peculiar; we shall, therefore, only briefly notice them at the conclusion of this chapter. In addition to these there are, however, other rnorbi changes, which occur only in the fetus, and of which it has never yet been observed, that they have originated in the same way after birth. These latter are termed malfor- mationsâ€”vitia primee conformationis. The peculiarity of these malformations, and their csscn la

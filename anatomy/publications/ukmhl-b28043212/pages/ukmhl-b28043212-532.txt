MALFORMATIONS. 5 12 parts, viscera, or the upper portion of the vertebral column, with a corresponding part of the brain and skull, are doubled. All the forms of this duplication are very rare, and have hitherto been observed only in animals. The forms hitherto noticed are : a. Partial duplication of the vertex (dicoryphus* Bar- kowâ€”dicranus, Gurlt). The cranium is doubled, the face not so, or only partially. The upper end of the vertebral column is also doubled, but there are present only two rows of ribs. Sometimes the superior extremities are also doubled. The brain and upper part of the spinal cord are more or less doubled. Heusner, descript, monstror. avium, &c. Diss. Berol. 1824; Gurlt, op, cit. p. 256. b. Partial duplication of the face (monocranus, Gurlt). The face may be partially doubled, the eyes, nose, tongue, and the cerebrum being especially implicated in the duplica- tion ; the cranium being single. Gurlt, vol. n. p. 216, &c. 2. The duplication may affect the upper half of the body. This may be more or less doubled, while the lower half of the body is single. The cases which belong to this class form a perfect transition-series from the simple cranial fissure to two almost completely separated bodies. The following are the principal forms: a. Duplication of the face (diprosopus, Barkow and Gurlt). The face is more or less doubled; the separation of the two faces commences anteriorly, and either does not extend at all, or only partially upon the skull. For the literature of this class see Barkow, vol. ii. p- 36; and Otto, op. cit. p. 223, 225, &c. Geoffrey St. Hilaire,t divides this group into * Kopvtptj, the top of the head, f Vol. iii. p. 195, &c.

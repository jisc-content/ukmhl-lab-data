PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 136 in unchanged pus-corpuscles, when the cell-wall is very thin and transparent.* In the majority of cases, the nucleus is covered by the granulated opaque cell-wall,f and does not become visible till the latter is dissolved or rendered transpa- rent by acetic acid.J In other cases, in which the develop- ment of the pus-corpuscle is imperfect, we see only the nucleus and no cell-wall.§ The nucleus does not lie in the centre of the pus-corpuscle, but as is the case with all cells, is situated eccentrically, and is usually attached to the inner surface of the cell-wall. We may convince ourselves of this by allowing pus-corpuscles to float and rotate in the field of the microscope. || It is only the larger nuclei that form an exception to this rule, for they are sometimes so large as to occupy the whole space of the pus- cell. The nucleus of the pus-corpuscle presents many pecu- liarities, and is so different from other nuclei, as to require a somewhat careful consideration. In other cells the nucleus is a simple body, but in the pus- corpuscle this is not always, or indeed generally the case; it is usually composed of several (2—5) minute granules forming a composite multiple nucleus. Sometimes on treating fresh pus-corpuscles with acetic acid, or a solution of salt, a single nucleus becomes apparent, indented like a trefoil leaf, or cloven into 2—4 smaller nuclei.^ But it is not every nucleus that undergoes this change; in some cases it appears to resist the action of these reagents. The single large pus-corpuscles with a diameter of the 100th to the 80th of a line, exhibit several (two, three or four) such nuclei, each of which is composed of smaller bodies insoluble in acetic acid. The corpuscles which form the nucleus, when, by the addi- * Plate nr. fig. 2, b, and fig. 11, a.

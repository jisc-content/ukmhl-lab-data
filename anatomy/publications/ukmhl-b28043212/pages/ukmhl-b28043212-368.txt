These are the substances which have been hitherto regarded as the constituents of the precipitates occurring in the human body. Further investigation will probably lead to a consider- able extension of the above list. From these precipitates, which are frequently invisible to the naked eye, and which, to be correctly observed in their various relations, require a microscopic examination, there are formed large concrements or concretions in a manner differing in individual cases, and not always very obvious. The various concretions may be arranged into two large groups: 1. Such as arise in the fluid secretions of the body ; and, 2. Such as are formed in the parenchyma of organs. FIRST CLASS. CONCRETIONS IN THE FLUID SECRETIONS. These are invariably formed from the above-mentioned pre- cipitates, but the mode of formation varies. They may arise in any or all of the following ways: 1. From an amorphous or crystalline precipitate there may be formed a tenacious crystalline massâ€”a concretion ; the same process taking place on a large scale, as on a smaller scale influences the conversion of an amorphous into a crystalline precipitate. 2. A portion of a loose, disconnected precipitate, may be held together by mucus or some other connecting medium. 3. The precipitate may attach itself to a foreign body in just the same manner as crystals deposit themselves around such a body inserted in a saline fluid, forming an incrusta- tion. In fact, there are two ways in which a foreign body exerts an influence in the formation of a concretion; one being, that it frequently excites a disposition in a fluid to form a precipitate. Thus, for instance, bv exciting inflammatory

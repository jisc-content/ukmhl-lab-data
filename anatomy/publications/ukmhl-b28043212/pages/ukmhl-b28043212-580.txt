560 EXPLANATION- OF THE PLATES. place was a yellowish white lardaceous mass (typhous matter). Under the microscope this substance appeared to be indefinitely gra- nular, amorphous, and of a brownish white colour. Both acetic acid and ammonia rendered it soft and transparent, much like coagu- lated fibrin. At various spots it contained irregular cells varying from the 300th to the 400th of aline in diameter (Fig. 13), and numerous fatty granules. Magnified 2"20 diameters. Fig. 14. Cells from typhous matter in Peyer’s glands; taken from a soldier who died whilst the disease was at its height. All Peyer’s and most of Brunner’s glands were thickened and infiltrated with typhous matter. There was, however, no appear- ance of ulceration; the mucous membrane covering the infiltrated glands being perfectly entire, though highly reddened and vascular. The typhous matter, which was deposited between the muscular and mucous coats of the intestines, appeared to be generally amorphous, although in some places there was a distinct cell-formation. Most of these cells contained several nuclei (Fig. 14). Magnified 220 diameters. Fig. 15. Typhous matter in the lowest stage of organization, from the lungs of a soldier Both lungs exhibited in almost every part tubercular-like nodules of a yellowish-white colour. Microscopic examination showed that at those spots there was an entire deficiency both of air and blood; neither was there any vestige of pulmonary tissue, but merely an amorpho-granular colourless mass covered with numerous fatty gra- nules. It exhibited no trace of cellular structure. On the addition of acetic acid this mass became transparent, and the normal pulmo- nary tissue which had been enclosed by it, was brought in view- Magnified 220 diameters.

510 MALFORMATIONS. formed. Sometimes, finally, the excessive number of parts is only apparent, and is founded upon an arrest of development. On these points the reader will find further details in Meckel, vol. ix. part i. p. 11, &c., and in Bischoff, op. cit. p. 909, &c. The malformations belonging to this order may be arranged in two subdivisions, according as the head and trunk are single, and only certain portions of them, or particular limbs and their parts are supernumerary; or as the head and trunk are double or even triple. I. MALFORMATIONS IN WHICH THERE ARE SUPERNUMERARY PARTS, BUT A SINGLE HEAD AND TRUNK. Most of the malformations belonging to this subdivision are noticed in the special part, so that in this place a mere specification of them is sufficient. 1. Supernumerary parts on the head. We may have mul- tiplication of the cranial bones, as double frontal bone, ossa wormiana (which are properly formations of arrest) ; duplication of the lower jaw and of the tongue ; supernume- rary teeth ; and in animals, supernumerary horns. 2. Supernumerary parts on the trunk, as an increased number of vertebrae; the formation of a tail in the human subject ;* supernumerary ribs, muscles, and mammas. 3. Supernumerary parts on the limbs. Supernumerary fingers and toes in the human subject are by no means rare, and sometimes appear to be hereditary. Six fingers on one hand are not unfrequent; a case in which there were seven fingers on one hand, and eight toes on one foot is given in Geoffroy St. Hilaire, PI. m.; several cases are also given in Otto, p. 267, &c. Supernumerary extremities with a single head and trunk, very rarely occur in man, but are comparatively frequent in animals. These cases form the transition to the second division. * See Meckel, vol. i. p. 385 ; and Geoffroy St. Hilaire, vol. i. p. 736.

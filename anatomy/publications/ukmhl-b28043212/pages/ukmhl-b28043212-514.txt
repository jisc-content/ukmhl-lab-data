MALFORMATIONS. 494 small or unshapely (perosomus, Gurlt) : an indistinctly characterised group, whose occurrence is rare in man, but more frequent in animals. They are not viable. Figures are given in Gurlt, op. cit. PI. in. fig. 5 and 6; PI. iv. fig. 1 and 2. 7. Malformations in which the trunk is defective, and too short, from the absence of one or more vertebrae; the head and limbs being normal (perocormus—oligospondylus, Gurlt). They arise either from an original defect in the for- mation of the vertebrae or from fusion of several into one. In man they are never observed, and only rarely in animals. These malformations do not affect life. Gurlt, op. cit. PI. ii. fig. 4; Otto, op. cit. No. 213, et seq. Ab- sence of the tail in animals belongs to this group. 8. The extremities may he deficient; all the limbs may be absent, or two or only one, or merely portions of the extre- mities may be wanting. The head and trunk may in this case, be either normal or abnormal (peromelus, Gurlt). This group may be reduced to several subdivisions; the forms included in it arise partly through original abnormalities of for- mation—the germinal elements for the extremities being either not evolved at all, or experiencing an arrest at some stage of the development; and partly through mechanical agencies—the extremities when perfected or in the act of forming, becoming atrophied from mechanical causes, as for instance, constric- tion by the funis. Such malformations are not unfrequently hereditary. The subjects of them are viable. For the literature and illustrations of tins group, we may refer to Meckel, vol. i. p. 748 et seq. where most of the earlier cases are collected; Otto, op. cit. p. 134 ; Herholdt, Beschreihung sechs menschl. Missgeb. p. 59 ; and Cruveilhier, Anat. pathol. livr. 28, Plate i. Geoffroy St. Hilaire names the higher grade of these malformations Ectromelcs* (vol. n. p. 307 et seq.) and reduces them into 3 genera. * iicrpweiv, to cause to abort.

EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. 539 PLATE 111. PV8 AND GRANULAR CELLS. The three first figures exhibit normal pus from abscesses of the cel- lular tissue. Magnified 410 diameters. Fig. 1. Shows pus-corpuscles (a) dark and compact, and covered with numerous granules. Besides the pus-corpuscles, we see many smaller granules (6) partly isolated, partly united. They consist of fatâ€”a mixture of olein and margarin. Fig. 2. Also normal pus, showing very soft, pale pus-corpuscles, which do not appear perfectly round, and are only covered by a few granules. At (6) we see the nucleus appearing through the delicate capsule. This pus contains no fat granules. Fig. 3. Bus-corpuscles treated with acetic acid. The acid has more or less completely dissolved the walls, and only left the nucleus remaining. At a we see a triple, at b a single nu- cleus, still surrounded by the faint remains of a wall. At c and d the wall is quite dissolved and the mere nuclei remain. The cup- like form of the nucleus on treating it with acetic acid, is the one common to normal pus-corpuscles. Fig. 4. Supposed pus (magnified 220 diameter?) from the pelvis of the kidney of a patient, who died of empyema. The pelvis of each kidney was completely filled with a yellowish white creamy fluid, which bore a perfect resemblance to pus : but on examination under the microscope nothing could bo seen but por- tions of epithelium mixed with a colourless fluid (urine) ; a, a por- tion of epithelium varying between the cylindrical and pavement forms ; b a single epithelial cell of this kind; c cylindrical epithe- lium seen from one side ; d a portion seen from above.

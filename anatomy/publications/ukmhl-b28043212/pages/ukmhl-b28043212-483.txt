ASCARIS. 463 of common occurrence, and of considerable size, varying from six to ten, or even fifteen inches in length, although occasionally, however, smaller, as from one to two inches long. It is usually of a whitish or brownish red colour, and occasionally blood-red. Its bodv is round, cylindrical, and pointed at both ends, but more decidedly at the anterior than at the posterior extremity. A delicate furrow runs along the body upon both sides. If the worm is examined under the microscope, it is perceived that the head is separated from the body by a kind of circular constriction, and presents three tubercles or peculiar valves, which can open and shut themselves, and have between them the proper opening of the mouth. In the interior of the body we may recognise the brownish intestinal canal which terminates in the anus, a little anterior to the extremity of the tail. This worm has the sexes distinct. The male is somewhat smaller, and has a more curved tail, from which, at intervals, the double penis is seen protruding. In the female, again, we may recognise the sexual organs, ovaries and oviduct, as white, partly thread-, partly riband-like organs which, when the worm breaks, readily fall out, and having become detached are frequently mistaken for individual worms. The ova measure the 25th of a line in length, and have a thin smooth shell. The round worm is of very frequent occurrence in the small intestines ot the human subject, especially in children. Its presence is not so injurious as is commonly supposed, for it is often found in great numbers without the slightest dis- turbance of the health. Yet it may certainly become trouble- some and even injurious, either by reason of its accumulating in great numbers, and exciting mechanical irritation in the intestinal canal, or even closing it up,* and thus producing * Haller observed an instance in which a girl aged ten years, died from the accumulation of ascarides in the fauces, mouth, trachea and bronchi.

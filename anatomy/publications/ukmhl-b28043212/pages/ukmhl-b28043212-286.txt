266 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. of the pseudoplasmata, we have still to seek for an explana- tion of their extension, and of their pernicious influence upon the whole organism. It has been mentioned that these consequences do not always ensue, that for instance, tubercles sometimes continue local, and the destruction caused by them may, as in other instances where loss of substance has occurred, heal by cica- trization. This, however, is not usually the case; in general, the pseudoplasmata progressively extend until they terminate in death. As the non-malignant tumours grow by the con- version (conformably to the law of analogous formation) of the nutritive fluid secreted in their surrounding parts into a structure resembling themselves, also so may malignant tumours be propagated according to the same law. Since, in this manner, the increased extent of the tumour is accompanied by an extension of the softening, the loss of substance and the destruction are constantly increasing. The softening of malignant tumours usually commences not upon their surface, but in their interior; the product of the softening, therefore, not being immediately discharged, the ichorous pus continues for some time in contact with the walls of the vessels, and, by endosmosis, its fluid parts are taken up into the lymph and blood; exerting a morbific influence, in a manner at present but little understood, upon these fluids, and thus gradually inducing a general cachexia. Moreover, the vessels which intersect the tumour become involved in the process of destruction, some indeed, becoming obliterated by it, whilst others are opened, and into the gaping mouths of such veins and lymphatics, not only the fluid but the solid particles of the softened mass enter, and proceeding further into them, excite phlebitis and inflam- mation of the lymphatics, with their consequences. These evil effects of their increase and of their general morbific influence upon the collective organism are shared by the pseudoplasmata and by ichorous suppurations ; the former, however, commonly possess them in a higher degree, being

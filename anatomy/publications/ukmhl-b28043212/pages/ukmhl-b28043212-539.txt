519 TRIPLET MONSTERS. in Fattori, whose work, de feti che racchiudono fell detti voUjarmente gravidi. Pavia, 1815, besides enumerating the earlier literature, contains the description of an interesting case, with exceedingly beautiful illustra- tions. More recent cases may be found in Schaumann, diss. sisteus cas. rarior. foetus in foetu. Borol. 1839; and Schonfeld, Annales de Gynecolog. et l\5diatrique. Septbre. 1841 ; or Froriep’s N. Notizen, vol. xx. 1841. p. 137. TRIPLET MONSTERS (MONSTRA TRIPLICA S. TRIGEMIKa). Some portions of the body are here not merely doubled, as in the case of twin monsters, but tripled. Triplet monsters are, indeed, very rare ; but latterly, even in man, their exist- ence has been positively shown. See the cases in Geoffroy St. Hilaire, vol. hi. p. 327, where one of especial interest is communicated—a child with three heads, observed in 1S32, by Drs. Keina and Galvagni, in Catania. SIXTH CLASS. MALFORMATIONS IN WHICH ONE OR MANY PARTS HAVE AN ABNORMAL SITUATION (SITUS MCTATUS). The malformations belonging to this class may be brought into the following subdivisions : 1. Congenital abnormalit ies in the situation of the viscera. The highest degree is seen in the complete reversing of all internal organs, in which the heart and spleen lie upon the right, the liver and csecum upon the left side, without the viability being in any way impaired. Of this anomaly, which has its origin in an abnormal development, the causes are quite unknown. For cases, see Meckel, vol. n. p. 183. &c.; and Geoffroy St. Hilaire, vol. li. p. G, &c. More recent cases are given in Herholdt, Beschrei- bung Bechs menschlicher Missgeburten. Copenhagen, 1830. Case i. and p. 65; and Valentin’s Ilcpertorium, 1837, p. 173. 2. Anomalies in the course of individual vessels (arteries, veins, and lymphatics). They arc very nume- rous and diversified. Their mode of origin cannot be

210 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. Under the microscope they appear to be composed of an aggregation of fat-cells, which perfectly accord with those of the normal fatty tissue. These fat-cells vary from the 1 2th to the 21 st of a line in diameter, and are round or else laterally compressed into a polyhedric form. They consist of an amorphous cell-wall which sometimes, but not often, encloses an undoubted nucleus, and of fluid fat contained in the interior. The fat may be thoroughly taken up by boiling alcohol or ether. It is chemically identical with the ordinary human fat, and consists of a mixture of olein and margarin. Sometimes the latter is present in so large a quantity, that as the body cools after death, or the tumour after extirpation, it forms acicular crystals, which appear either singly or in stellar groups in the interior of the fat-cells.* The cell-wall j probably consists of a protein-compound. When a fresh tumour of this kind is submitted to pressure _ under the microscope, some of the fat cells burst, and the fat escapes from them in the form of oil-globules. These appear, i therefore, to he an artificial product. In a true lipoma, I have never seen free fat-globules, j In the normal fatty tissue, there are vessels and fibres | of areolar tissue, in greater or less abundance, between j the true fat-cells; and the same is the case in fatty | tumours. Sometimes the vessels, and more especially, | the areolar tissue are very sparingly found. In other cases, | on the contrary, the areolar tissue abounds, forming tough | fibrous partitions between the parcels of fatty cells.t The J tumour is firm and solid, assuming more or less the physical | qualities of lard, in proportion as the areolar tissue abounds. , It then receives the name of lardaceous tumour (Steatoma or Tumeur lardacee). Fatty tumours are thus histologically | combined with the next group, namely, fibrous tumours. * Plate x. fig. 3. f Plate VII. fig. 1.

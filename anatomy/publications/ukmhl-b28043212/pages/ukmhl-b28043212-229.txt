FATTY TUMOURS. 209 Most kinds of tumours, non-malignant as well as malignant, are in some degree furnished with vessels. These tumours when the vessels predominate, may be regarded as a combination of some other form with the vascular. Such combinations frequently occur at a certain stage of malignant tumours, namely when they soften, break up and form on their surface luxuriant and very vascular spongy granulations. Hence arises a peculiar form of malignant epigenesis, termed Fungus fuvmatodes, of which we shall speak hereafter, and which must not be confounded with true Telangiectasis. Common as vessels are in other forms of tumours, yet except in tin* case of common vascular tumour, they play only a subordinate part, the characteristic properties being dependant on other tissues. Hence that appears an unsuitable arrangement of Abemethy,* in which he places tumours containing vessels in a class or species by themselves ; for his “ common vascular or organized sarcoma,”embraces within its range many tumours differing exceedingly from one another in their essential proper- ties. In our observations uj>on the different tumours, we shall continually return to the consideration of the relation in which vessels stand to the remaining elements of their composition. With regard to the varieties of vascular tumours, we shiill say more in the special part in which we treat of tumours in the different organs. SECOND GROUP. TUMOURS CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OP ADIPOSE TISSUE. Fatly Tumours. In many tumours fatty tissue is the prevailing element ; indeed some tumours consist of it alone. To such we apply the term Lipoma. In appearance they resemble normal fatty tissue : when recent, they present to examination a soft mass of yellowish colour, with a fatty feeling, which on being dried or heated gives out fluid fat, forming greasy spots upon paper. * Aberncthy’s Surgical Observations, p. 19.

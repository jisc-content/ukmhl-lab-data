PUS. 153 : pus-corpuscles we observe an indeterminate, grumous, and often reddish-brown mass. This pus is impure. Mucus is often mixed with pus in suppuration of the mucous membranes: it then contains mucin which renders it tenacious and capable of being drawn out in threads, in addi- tion to epithelium-cells, and other substances of accidental occurrence. On the addition of acetic acid the mucus coagu- lates, entangling the nuclei of the dissolving pus-corpus- cles.* Moreover, pus from abscesses without containing any of the secreted products of the mucous membranes, sometimes appears tenacious and stringy, its serum containing a viscid substance in solution, which is coagulable by acetic acid and alum (pyin ?).f Moreover, the cells of the epidermis or of glands, flocculi, and crystals of eholesterin or of aminoniaco- magnesian phosphate, are not unfrequently mixed with pus.J b. On changes in the structural portion of the pus itself, malformations of the pus-corpuscles, 8fc. The pus-corpuscles sometimes differ more or less from their normal type, losing their regular rounded form, and becoming angular or club- shaped.^ The nuclei also frequently appear changed.|| Sometimes, on the addition of acetic acid, no nuclei make their appearance, (being apparently entirely absent), and we observe only the minute molecules which are noticed after treating pus with alkalies or a solution of bo rax. In many cases the quantity of the granular molecules, which consist either of modified protein-compounds or of fat, appears to be increased in the pus, and sometimes, from the simultaneous deficiency of pus-corpuscles, it would seem as if these granules had taken their place, being either broken up or abortive corpuscles.

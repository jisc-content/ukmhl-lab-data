GALL-STONES. 371 distinct and well-marked shape. When occurring singly they are round; when several are present, they assume a polyhedric form. There are two kinds of gall-stones which possess very characteristic forms—those consisting of crystallized carbonate of lime, which are pointed and jagged ; and those formed of dark pigment, which usually present a nodulated appearance, like mulberry-calculi. The colour of gall-stones depends on their chemical constituents, and is hence by no means constant. The following may be regarded as the principal forms of biliary concretions, arranged according to their physical cha- racter : 1. Fine precipitates of bile-pigment and crystallized choles- terin imbedded in mucus, mixed with epithelium whose cells are sometimes incrusted. 2. Biliary gravel—minute concretions of the size of a hempseed, or grain of sand; occasionally many such concre- tions are united by mucus so as to form a large mulhrrre- shaped calculus. 3. Soft biliary concretions, which in a recent state readily admit of being moulded between the fingers, consisting of ' crystalline depositions of cholesterin, between which there is bile-pigment.* 4. Crystalline calculi consisting for the most part of cho- lesterin, nearly colourless, transparent, with a crystalline fibrous fracture, granular on the surface, and usually covered with minute crystals of cholesterin. 5. Dark calculi of a reddish-brown colour, and earthy frac- ture which does not become bright by friction. These con- sist for the most part of bile-pigment. There is a variety of this species, which is of a dark-brown, almost black colour, and exhibits a red, mulberry-like appear- * See Plate x. fig. 5. B B 2

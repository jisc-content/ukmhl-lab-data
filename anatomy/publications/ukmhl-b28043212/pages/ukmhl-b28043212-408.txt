388 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. As illustrations of their chemical composition, we may refer to the urinary and intestinal concretions formerly described (p. 358 and 376), which belong to this class, and may add the following analyses : 1 2 3 4 Protein-compounds and water. 35 10 24.3 53.16 Soluble salts. — 4 4.0 — Phosphate of lime . 61 30 65.3 43.67 Carbonate of lime 4 54 — 3.17 Carbonate of magnesia. . a trace — 6.5 — Phosphate of magnesia. . a trace 100 98 100.1 a trace 100.00 1. A concretion from the thyroid gland, (Prout, quoted in L. Gmelin, ii. 2, 1370). 2. A concretion from the thyroid gland of a cretin, (Iphofen fiber den cretinismus, Dresden, 1817). 3. A concretion from the pericardium, analysed by Robinet and Petroz, (Berzelius, Thierchemie, p. 721). It was formed of several thick layers which were covered with earthy, pulveriza- ble, verrucose concretions. The organic constituents were partly organized (areolar tissue which on boiling yielded gelatin) ; and partly unorganized (soluble in liquid potash fibrin); the soluble salts consisted of sulphate of soda, with a trace of sulphate of lime. 4. A concretion from the uterine surface of the placenta, analysed by Wiggers (Berzelius, op. cit. p. 723). The organic constituents were fibrin, with a little fat, areolar tissue, and albumen. The water amounted to 7$. The morphological relations of these concretions, present even greater diversities than then* chemical composition: they are not merely different in different concretions, but may also vary in the same concretion in different stages of its development. Sometimes the epigenesis is soft, and the organic constituents predominate; we can then discover by chemical analysis that there is a considerable increase in the salts of lime. In many cases the mass appears as an incrus- tation, ossification, or calculus. Illustrations of these forms may be seen in the second volume, in the chapters on the individual organs.

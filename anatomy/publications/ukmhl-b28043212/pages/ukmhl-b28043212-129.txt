109 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. : tself—whence do they arise, and from what part of the body ire they produced? In the present condition of our physical 1 knowledge, I believe that no one will dispute with me, that ^without further preamble we may establish the principle as a general law, that the cytoblastema of every morbid product, ;.is also of the tissues in healthy nutrition, is obtained from the vvessels, and that its source is always the blood, or in some few cases the chyle or lymph. In normal nutrition the pro- position cannot be determined by direct observation; but the ^grounds on which the probability is founded, are so sound, as to prevent the possibility of denial, for all the nutriment which in the latter instance the formative material conveys t to all parts of the body, passes at length into the blood ; on the other hand, parts to which the supply of blood is checked or diminished are not at all, or only imperfectly nourished, i In pathological epigeneses, it may often be directly observed that in consequence of inflammation, the plasma exudes through t|ie vessels and forms the cytoblastema; and in a cases in which we observe no morbid secretion, it is i t more than probable that the ordinary nutrient fluid escapes t through the vessels without inflammatory action, and thus s forms a blastema for morbid products. Information on the processes by which this increased separation of plasma from the vessels is effected, has been already afforded in the section on fibrinous dropsy. I shall advert to the subject more fully in treating of inflammation. Organized morbid epigeneses are therefore produced in a blastema separated from the blood, and at the expense of the fibrin contained in it. Before we consider the processes which take place in development, we will take a glance at the question,—on what is the development of the cytoblas- tema dependant ? A purely chemical precipitation like those by which unorganized forms are produced, cannot in this case be regarded as sufficient, for while chemistry serves to point out the chemical differences between these formations,

MALFORMATIONS. 508 FIRST ORDER. ONE OR MORE FARTS DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE. In many cases the whole body is too large, but the parts are more or less proportionate. These cases present themselves under very different forms: in some instances, the individual, even at birth, is larger than usual; in others he becomes prematurely developed after birth ; and again in others he attains to an abnormal size, and becomes a giant, or excessively corpulent (polysarcia). The greater number of these abnormalities do not properly belong to congenital malformations, and consequently demand merely a passing notice. The tallest men, respecting whose heights we possess trustworthy statements, measured eight and a half feet, or perhaps a little more. Cases have been observed in which the growth of the beard and other indications of almost full development have occurred m children seven years of age, and even younger. Excessne corpulence has been chiefly observed in England; cases are recorded in which individuals have attained a weight of six hundred and fifty pounds. For further details on this subject we must refer to Meckel, op. cit. vol. ii. part i. p. 2, et seq.; and Geoffroy St. Hilaire, vol. i. p. 168. In a similar manner, individual parts of the body may be too large; this, however, is rarely a congenital malformation, but more commonly local hypertrophy acquired after biith. The most frequent of the congenital malformations belonging to this class is a disproportionate size of the head, from the accumulation of fluid in the craniumâ€”hydrocephalus congenitus. For cases see Geoffroy St. Hilaire, vol. i. p. 253, &c. SECOND ORDER. ONE OR SEVERAL SUPERNUMERARY ORGANS. This order presents a very great number of varieties, from the simplest cases, in which a single joint of a finger is super- numerary, to those of a highly complicated nature, where two, or even three bodies are united by some one point twin or triplet monsters.

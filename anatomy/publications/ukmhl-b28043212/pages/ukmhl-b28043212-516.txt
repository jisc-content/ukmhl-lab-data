MALFORMATIONS. 496 where many instances are collected, and a few described in detail. An account of a family of dwarfs may be seen in Casper’s Wochenschr. 1842, p. 705. 2. Dwarfish head, (nanocephalus, Gurlt). The whole head or certain parts of it being too small, while the trunk and extremities are normal. The higher grades of this group are allied to the perocephali, namely to the microprosopi. In man they are rare, but are almost always viable. To this group we must refer arrested development of the lower jaw, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, vol. i. p. 259. 3. Dwarfish trunk, (nanocormus, Gurlt). The trunk, with or without extremities, being two small, whilst the head possesses its normal size. 4. Divarfish limbs, (nanomelus, Gurlt). Some or other part of an extremity being too small, and the whole limb being therefore too short, but yet no part of it being absent. Head and trunk are generally normal. This form is allied, as a lower degree, to the peromeli. Cases belonging to the preceding groups are given in Geoffroy St. Hilaire, vol. i. p. 251, et seq. SECOND CLASS. MALFORMATION FROM COALESCENCE OF ORGANS. Coalitio partium—Symphysis. Parts which normally lie together unconnected, (usually in the mesial line of the body), may approximate more close- ly than in the normal state, and form a coalition; there thus arises a new and peculiar formation. In many cases this coalescence is only possible in consequence of the atrophy or total absence of parts, which in the normal state separate the organs here united. In this way many of the cases included here are in the closest alliance with the preceding class. We have the following w7ell characteiized groups. 1. Malformations by coalescence on the head. These

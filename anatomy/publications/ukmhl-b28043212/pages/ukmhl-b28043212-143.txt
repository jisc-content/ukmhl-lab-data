CELLULAR FORMATION. 123 !i Plate x. fig. 3. but soluble in ether, and therefore probably of a fatty nature. The contents of the cell, when they are distinct from the cell-wall, are usually fluid. They cannot be detected by the eye, and their presence can, therefore, only be inferred by the circumstance that the cell collapses when bursting under the compressor, and that its fluid contents escape. They form a tolerably concentrated solution of matter soluble in water, as their relation in respect to endosmosis testifies, for on placing such cells in pure water, they swell till they burst, since their contents by endosmosis absorb water; in concentrated saline solutions, on the other hand, they shrivel, since they lose water by exosmosis. Sometimes the cells contain fluid fat in the form of drops, which may be distin- guished under the microscope from the surrounding fluid by their different refracting power.* The solid contents of cells are usually granular, and the granules are most commonly devoid of colour ;f but sometimes they are black, brown, or orange. The chemical properties of these contents are various ; sometimes the granules consist of fat, and are then soluble in ether; sometimes of calcareous salts, in which case they dissolve in acids. As examples of cells with coloured contents, we may mention those containing black pigment.J and yellow bile-pigment.ยง Moreover, crystalline deposits sometimes occur within cells, crystalline groups of margarin being occasionally noticed in fat-cells. j| It is not always easy to distinguish whether granular matter is actually within the cell, or only deposited on its walls. According to the theory of Schwann, who ascribes the formation of all structure to cells, the process of develop- ment is not completed by the above mentioned formation: the cells undergo further changes, and do not follow the * Plate i. fig. 9. t fig- 2; pi. in. fig. 12 and 13. 1 Plate i. fig. 10. ยง Plate i. fig. 8.

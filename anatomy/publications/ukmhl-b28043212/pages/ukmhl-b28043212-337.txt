317 ENCEPHALOID. hero, as wc have already shewn in the case of the other tumours, a division into species, such as is adopted in natural history, is impracticable: like many minerals, cancer presents a group of forms merging into one another without any fixed lino of demarcation, the individual constituents being, to a rertain degree, vicarious, and reciprocally displacing one another. The following are the chief of these forms : FIRST FORM. CELLULAR CANCER EXCKPHALOID.* Synon. Medullary sarcoma -, fungus modullaris; cancer medullaris; carcinoma medullarc; milk-like tumour. Encophaloid is that variety of cancer in which the cancer- cells predominate over the remaining histological elements of the tumour. It appears to be generally developed from a fluid cytoblastema, and hence in examining it during its early stages of development, we rarely find the firm, amorphous cytoblastema, which is usually met with in other forms of cancer. The fibrous tissue is never so prominent an ingre- dient as the cancer-cells ; indeed, in some cases it appears to be altogether absent, so that the cancer-cells are directly deposited between the normal histological dements of the affected organ; more frequently, however, it occurs in a subordinate degree, forming a stroma in which the cancer- ! cells lie. When the fibres predominate, encophaloid merges into fibrous cancer, and we sometimes observe that while one portion of a tumour resembles encephaloid, another more closely approximates to fibrous cancer. The viscid fluid likewise occurs almost constantly in encephaloid after soften- * Compare J.

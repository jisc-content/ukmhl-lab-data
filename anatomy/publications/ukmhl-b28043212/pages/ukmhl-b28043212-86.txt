66 PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. atmospheric oxygen ;* on the other hand, it is well known that the artificial addition of many salts to fresh blood retards the coagulation. Hence wc must conclude that a slow coagulation is frequently dependant on an increase of the salts. According to H. Nasse, the blood of the common hen and the goose, which is very slow in coagulating, con- tains from one third to one half more salts than human blood.f In every case the cause of the difference appears to be chemical, and not vital. 2. Many deviations occur in the consistence and other properties of the clot, as well as in the proportion of its volume to that of the serum. The clot is sometimes very tough and firm, difficult to break up, and offering a resistance to the knife ; in other cases, it is very soft and loose, forming a slightly consistent gelatinous mass, like currant jelly, breaking up on the slightest touch; in some cases it even happens that no true clot is formed, the blood remaining fluid, and, after standing for some time, merely forming a few soft, flocculent coagula. These are the two extremes, between which there may be many intermediate degrees. These dif- ferences are dependant on the condition of the fibrin, and in part, also, on its quantity. In proportion to the coagulating tendency possessed by the fibrin, and to its quantity, so much the firmer and more solid is the clot, which, in this way furnishes us with an approximation to the amount of fibrin present. These modifications of the fibrin may depend on various causes, all, however, of a chemical nature. The most frequent cause is the same that retards the coagulation, namely, an increase of the salts; in extreme cases, when, for instance, no coagulation takes place, it depends on an increase of the alkaline carbonates. The salts, when arti- ficially added, lessen the tendency to coagulation, and the latter * See Nasse’s Article in Wagner’s Handwdrterbuch, &c., vol. 1. p. 112. f Op. cit. p. 114.

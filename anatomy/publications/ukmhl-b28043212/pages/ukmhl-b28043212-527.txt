507 MALFORMATIONS OF EXCESS. FOURTH CLASS. MALFORMATIONS IN WHICH NORMAL OPENINGS ARE CLOSED.—Atresia.* Since most of the malformations belonging to this class stand in relation to individual organs, and will hence be more particularly described in the special part, we shall here content ourselves with a specification of the principal forms. Their origin can usually be referred to an arrest of structure.f The higher grades alone are incompatible with life. 1. Atresia on the head (atretocephalus Gurlt). These include congenital occlusion of the mouth, of the nostrils, of the external auditor)' foramen, of the palpebral fissure, and of the pupils. Cases are recorded in Meckel, vol. i. pp. 396, 401, 407 ; in Geoffroy St. Hilaire, vol. i. p. 525, et seq.; and in Otto, p. 315. 2. Atresia on the trunk (utretocormus Gurlt) are, chiefly, imperforate conditions of the anus, of the urethra, and of the vagina. I heir higher grades are always combined with malformations of internal organs—of the intestinal canal, or of the generative system. Meckel, vol. i. pp. 591, 655, 662; Geoffroy St. Hilaire, vol. i. pp. 521, 533; Otto, p. 316 ; Cas. deChonski, devitio quod priinae form, infer, potiss. tubi intest, partem et vesic. urin. sjiectat.

385 CONCRETIONS IN THE PARENCHYMA. ]**rsons. In such cases we can easily trace the formation of concretions to a general disposition or diathesis. Depositions of this nature form precipitates, or incrus- tations, or (where they occur in large masses) ossifications; we use the word in the popular sense, and mean only to imply that organized tissues become surrounded, enclosed, and thus, in a manner, petrified: it is very' rarely that they form isolated calculi. They may occur in all vascular organs of the body, and in morbid fluids, as for instance, pus. For the sj>ecial relations of these concretions in individual organs, we must refer to the second volume. In the present place we sliall only give one or two illustrations by way of showing how their chemical com- position varies in different cases. Thus twelve concretions found in pus taken from the pleural sac of a man aged sixty-six years yielded :* Phosphate of lime. 49.1 Carbonate of lime. 21.1 Insoluble mucus (modified protein?) 27.8 Fat. .... 1.8 Soluble salts. 0.2 100.0 In this case the concretions lay jxrfectly free in the fluid, and were only united by a mucoid mass. Examples of incrustations of this kind are very frequent. To this class belong the depositions which arc not unfrequently met w ith in the choroid plexus of the brain, consisting of round microscopic cells, coated with phosphate and carbonate of iimc.t When occurring in large masses, these incrustations resemble ossifications in the cellular tissue, the muscles, the biliary ducts, and especially in the heart and arteries. The following examples will serve to give an idea of their chemical composition : 1 2 3 Areolar tissue yielding gelatin on boiling. 68 26 — Carbonate of lime. 8 23 a trace Phosphute of lime. 24 51 80 Ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate. — — 20 100 1(H) 100 * Prus—Valentin’s Ilepertorium, 1837, p. 118. 1 Henle’s Allgem.

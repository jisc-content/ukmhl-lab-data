INFLAMMATION. 419 ther this appearance ocfcurs in every formation of tubercle; but a direct answer to this question is impossible, since the earliest stage of tuber- culous formation is in most cases hidden from our observation. Analogy alone enables us to draw the conclusion, that, as in most other patholo- gical epigeneses, this appearance precedes, and seems to furnish matter for the new structure, so in the formation of tubercles the same is most probably the case. This, however, does not exclude the possibility that in many cases, a qualitatively changed, nutrient fluid, even without abnor- mal increase—without capillary hypenemia and fibrinous dropsy—may directly pass into tubercles. It is the province of pathology to discover, whether those appearances generally considered to Ix-long to inflammation, and which do not fall under the department of pathological anatomy— as disturbances of the nervous system—do, or do not occur in the for- mation of tubercles. If even in the course of time science should succeed in being able to give an affirmatorv reply to these two questions, it must still be left to the judgment of the individual physician to decide upon this point according to the idea that he attaches to the term inflammation. This one example may suffice to point out the principles on wluch similar points must be decided. \\ c shall notice, in the special part, the elementary changes which occur simultaneously, but which unlike those consi- dered above, appear to be accidentally associated together, and not connected by one originating cause.

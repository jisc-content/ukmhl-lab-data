CHANGES IN PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. 390 CHAPTER VI. PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE TISSUES AND ORGANS OF THE BODY. Hitherto we have, with the exception of the changes in the hlood, treated only of substances which, either do not occur in the normal body, or are at least modified and in different combinationsâ€”as those presenting themselves in many patho- logical conditions. These pathological epigeneses, taken in the widest sense of the word, arc accompanied by certain pathological changes, affecting the physical properties of the body. These changes are numerous, and extend to all the perceptible properties of the tissues and organs of the body, most frequently, however, altering their colour, size and con- sistence. They seldom occur singly, but generally simulta- neously with other pathological changes, which, indeed, give rise to them; it is therefore impossible to separate them accu- rately from one another. Their consideration is only so far important to pathology, in as much as a description of them, and the knowledge of their differences may tend to clear up their causes and consequences. But such an attempt would at present be accompanied with great difficulties, since the causes of these changes arc still very little known, and are extremely numerous and involved. The most important of these changes are the follow- ing:

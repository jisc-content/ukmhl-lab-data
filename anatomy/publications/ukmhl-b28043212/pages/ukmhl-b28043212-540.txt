MALFORMATIONS. 520 * See Bischoff, op. cit. p. 918. explained without entering deeply into the history of deve- lopment.* 3. Changes in the arrangement of the bones, curvature of the vertebral column, club-foot, club-hand, &c., are for the most part the consequences of abnormal contractions of the muscles during foetal life. For cases of this nature see Cruveilhier, Anat. pathol. livr. u. pi. u., hi., iv. ; and Otto, pp. 281, 284, 317, 322. SEVENTH CLASS. MALFORMATIONS OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS HERMAPHRODITISM. In this class we must place the cases where, in consequence of abnormal development, the generative organs of one sex approximate to those of the other, or where on one and the same individual both male and female generative organs occur —in short, all malformations affecting the generative appa- ratus, whereby the sex is made at all doubtful. For the general literature, see Meckel, vol. ii. Part 1, p. 196, et seq.; GeofFroy St. Hilaire, vol. ii. p. 30 et seq. ; Simpson’s article, Her- maphroditism in Todd’s Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology, p. 684 ; J. F. Ackermann, Infantis androgyni historia. Jense, 1805 ; and G. Stegleliner, de hermaphroditorum natura, 1817. This class is usually arranged in two divisions: 1. False hermaphroditism, where the occurrence of double sexual organs is only apparent. 2. True hermaphroditism, where male and female organs of generation actually occur in the same individual. 1. FALSE HERMAPHRODITISM. All cases belonging to this division, are characterized by the sexual organs of an individual, or at least the external paits of generation approximating, in consequence of malformation, more or less closely to those of the opposite sex, so as to render the sex doubtful.

233 MELANOTIC TUMOURS. arc unconnected with bone—as for instance those ot the dura mater—remain entirely unknown. Osseous tumours are invariably non-malignant: nevertheless when combined with other elements they may be destroyed by ulceration, &c. and this destructive process may proceed in the form of caries or necrosis to attack the newly formed osseous tissue itself; this is especially the case with the bony tumours combined with malignant elements. Our knowledge of the bony tumours is still very imjierfect, especially with regard to their histological relations.* The classification and nomenclature of the tumours belonging to this group are also very confusing; there belong to it the different species of exostosis, some of the osteosarcomata, osteosteatomata, some cases of spina ventosa, the osteo-phyte of Gluge, and the osteoid of Midler. The more minute characteristics of all these tumours will be given in the special part. SIXTH GROUP. TUMOURS K.NTIKKL.Y OB IN TAUT CONSISTING OF DARK riGVKNT. Melanotic Tumours. In many tumours there occurs a dark pigment as a more or less prevalent constituent. Thus pigment appears, however, so far as the still scanty histological investigations of such tumours enable us to judge, to present very different charac- ters. In many cases it consists of dark (brown or black) granules enclosed in more or less distinct rounded or elongated cells, sometimes it is altered blood-pigment, and occasio- * The sjiccial literature is given in the chapter on the morbid changes in bone. In addition to the references previously given, respecting the morbid epigenesis of osseous tissue, we may notice : G. Gluge, Atlas dcr putholog. Anatomic, Part n. (osteophyten) ; and J. Muller in hisArchiv. 1843. Ueber ossificirende Schwiimmc oder Osteoid-Geschwulste, p. 39(5, &c.; in both places there is a copious bibliography of the earlier writers.

ENCYSTED TUMOURS. 251 hairs; those which are inrooted, on the other hand, possess a perfectly organised hair-root, a hair-sac presenting the normal structure, and likewise are frequently accompanied bv sebaceous glands. The inrooted hairs are sometimes scat- tered over the entire sac, sometimes are collected in bunches upon certain spots of its surface, the rest of the sac presenting no hairs; the latter is particularly the case with the longer hairs: the sac at the points where the hairs are affixed shows precisely the same structure as the normal cranial integu- ment.* The sac of these tumours, moreover, affords the same varieties as were described of the encysted tumours generally ; it is frequently of unequal thickness and exhibits patches of earthy depositions. The contents, besides the hairs, usually consist of fatty substances, which are chiefly olein, margarin, and fatty acids: cholesterin and epithelial cells are generally very scanty, or altogether absent. It admits of no doubt that Jill these hairs, like the normal hairs of the human body, originally developed themselves from hair-sacs, and were at first implanted in the cyst: the loose hairs have subsequently become detached and fallen out, and being insoluble, and therefore resisting absorption, have accumulated in the sac in precisely the same manner as was described of the epithelium in the interior of encysted tumours. It may happen that such detached hairs, at different points of their length (but not at their extre- mities), become again fastened to the sac by fibrinous exudation, calcareous depositions, cellular tissue, &c., (Cruvcilhier); this, however, is only a mechanical, not an organic connection. The fat which forms the re- maining contents of these tumours Is, without doubt, the product of secretion of the sebaceous glands which * A scries of instructive plates and descriptions of encysted tumours containing hair arc given by Cruvcilhier, Anat. patholog. livr. xvm.

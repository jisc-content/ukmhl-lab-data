INTRODUCTION. 4 lously followed its indications, and so discharged his duty, is his only comfort, when in sadness he is constrained to confess the inutility of all his efforts. Above all, we must not he led away by such phrases as “ practical views” and “ medical experience”— terms of common use, and too often conveying an erroneous impression. The practical views of the physician are the result of a series of accurate observations elucidating the treatment of disease. The true physician may be distinguished from the empiric by this, that the latter is more or less unconscious of the grounds on which he acts ; and if the experience of the empiric seems in some few cases to be more successful than science, it can only be referred to a fortunate chance directing to the right point, and probably not based on the conscious experience of a single case. But science itself consists of the accumulated experience of individuals; and in proportion as that experience is limited (and especially when it is confined to a single individual) it follows from the very nature of the case that it cannot rest on a sufficiently broad scientific basis. In proportion as the science advances, and its cultivation is zealously carried on, so much the more will practical views and experience become the common pro- perty of all physicians who combine theory and practice; and that which was formerly regarded as the exclusive property of the medical pioneer will be open to all—will be almost the common stock of all who strive to obtain it. It has been shown by long experience that scepticism in medicine leads, as it does in religion, to bigotry and superstition. It often leads its votaries to become the con- verts of one-sided unscientific systems, which having some semblance of truth, have at different periods been brought forward and supported, such as Humoralism, Solidism, Bruno- nianism, Iatrochemistry, Homoeopathy, Hydropathy, and the like, which after a short meteoric brilliancy have utterly disap- peared ; or, in better cases, after withdrawing their vaunting pretensions, have contributed the germs of truth which they contained to the great stock of medical knowledge.

PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 272 amongst the normal tissues, gradually softens, and as the normal elements of the region become also involved in this process, forms ulcers which either heal by cicatrization, or continue until the death of the patient. In many cases death takes place before the commencement of softening. Of the phenomena which attend the softening and cicatrization in the different organs we shall treat in the special part: in this place our attention will be directed to the mass alone. This must, in every case, be deposited in the fluid state, and subsequently assume the solid form by coagulation: otherwise it could not so completely fill up all the interstices of the tissues. Upon examination, however, it is invariably found coagulated: at least, I am acquainted with no instance where it has been observed still fluid. Under the microscope the following constituents are recog- nized in the mass. 1. An amorphous, semi-transparent stroma. 2. Molecular granules from a size too minute to estimate, to the 800th of a line in diameter; sometimes interspersed with larger fat globules. 3. Larger corpuscles (imperfect cells and cytoblasts) from the 800th to the 300th of a line in diameter, rarely larger. Some of these enclose smaller corpuscles (elementary granules and nucleoli) which are wanting in others* By acetic acid the amorphous substance is rendered more transparent, and at length invisible; the granules as well as the cytoblasts and nucleoli remaining unchanged, whilst the cells become paler and gradually disappear. By alkalies, on the contrary, the entire mass is rendered diaphanous, and there remain visible only a greater or smaller number of granules: this reaction is produced more rapidly by potash, than by ammonia. These three elements, in different cases, are present in very varying quantities, the amorphous matter seldom predomi * See Plate vi. fig. 12, 13, 14, 15.

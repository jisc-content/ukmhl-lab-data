PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 368 2. A lachrymal concretion found by Desmarres in the lachrymal duct and sac, weighed about six grains, and had a specific gravity of 1.4 : analysed by Bouchardat, (Annales d’oculistique, Aout, 1842). Other cases may be found in Walther’s Journal der Chirurgie, 1820, p. 164; Sandifort’s Observat. anat. patholog. vol. hi. p. 71, where many older cases are referred to. 4. Concretions in the nostrils, the throat, the tonsils, and the bronchi, originate in the same manner as salivary calculi, and have a similar chemical composition. Such concretions sometimes occur as incrustations around foreign bodies. Ruysch relates* that an amber bead which had accidentally lodged in the nose of a child of five years of age, and was not ex- pelled until the girl attained her fourteenth year, was surrounded by a stony crust. The same authority gives another case, where the same thing occurred with a cherry stone. Grandoni describedf a stony concretion, which had formed in the left nostril of a woman, and was extracted with the forceps. It weighed seventy-six grains, and con- tained phosphate and carbonate of lime, carbonate of magnesia, and organic matter with traces of iron. Two other forms of concretions had the following composition : 1 2 Phosphate of lime. 46.7 79.56 Carbonate of lime. 21.7 6.41 Carbonate of magnesia. 8.3 — Chloride of sodium and other soluble salts.

A concretion from the nose, which had occasioned a periodical hemicrania; it was of a yellow-grayish colour, and earthy : ana- lysed by Geiger. The animal matters were noted as mucus, fibrin, osmazome and fat, (L. Gmelin, n. 2, 1397). 2. A concretion from the nose of a woman aged seventy years : ana- lyzed by Brandes, (Berzelius, vol. ix. p. 722). A concretion from the tonsils analysed by Laugier, was greyish-white, * Observat. anatomico-chirurg. centuria. Observ. 45. t Omodei annali universali di medicina. Ottobre, 1839.

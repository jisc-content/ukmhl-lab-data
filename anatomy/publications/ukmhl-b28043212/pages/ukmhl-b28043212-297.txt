277 TUBERCLE. with the morbid phenomena which are pointed out as charac- teristic of tuberculosis; and thirdly, that tuberculosis is posi- tively always the cause and not merely the effect of local tubercles; on the contrary, it was conceived that enough had been done when this correspondence was rendered probable for only one organâ€”the lungs, where tliey certainly appear most frequently. It is, however, certain that physicians fre- quently regard tumours in the brain, under the peritoneum, and even in the lungs to be tubercles, when their histological structure shows that this is not the case; moreover, as was stated generally of the pseudoplasmata belonging to this class, true tubercular matter cannot be distinguished with certainty from other epigeneses, namely from the scrofulous and typhous, and from many other ulcerative processes. In a pathologico-anatomieal view, therefore, the definition of tubercle is by no means strictly limited ; whether or not this is the case with the morbid process which is named tubercu- losis cannot in this place be investigated.* 1 will now endeavour to consider the general relations of this pathological epigenesis: its peculiar relations in individual organs will be considered in the special part. With respect to the origin of tubercle, there can be no doubt that its formative substance is secreted from the capillary vessels in a fluid form, in perfectly the same manner as was stated of typhoid matter. It afterwards fills up all the interstices of the tissues in a manner too perfect to be accomplished by any substance that was not originally fluid. Probably this secretion results from the same causes as that ot fibrinous dropsy generally, and is preceded by a local hyper- jemia ot the participating capillaries. Whether or not this proceeding should be termed inflammation, is a question which will be subsequently considered. Pathological anatomy fails to demonstrate an especial cause for this secretion from ' See Engel, op. fit.

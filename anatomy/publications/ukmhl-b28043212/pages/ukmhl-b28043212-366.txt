PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 346 * See Plate x. tig. 5. The formation of this precipitate is easily explained: all the fluids of the animal body contain, as a general rule, phosphate of magnesia, and if ammonia is brought in contact with this salt, crystals of ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate are produced. Hence it is that these crystals are amongst the most common that are met with in the microscopic examina- tion of the human body. In the dead body, in which ammonia is developed as a product of decomposition, all the tissues, as well as all the fluids, are often filled with them. Moreover, on examining under the microscope almost any animal fluid to which ammonia has been added, we observe groups of crystals of the first form. 6. Sulphuret of iron, when it occurs in large patches, appears to the naked eye as a black, dark blue, or blackish- green deposit. Under the microscope we observe it as a gra- nular precipitate, whose granules vary from mere molecules to the 400th of a line in diameter. It is insoluble in water, but dissolves in acids; on treating an acid solution with hydrosulphate of ammonia, a black precipitate is again formed. The manner in which this precipitate is formed has been already (see page 195) explained. 7. Bile-pigment (the cholepyrrhin of Berzelius, the bili- pheein of Simon) appears as a finely-granular precipitate (sparingly interspersed with minute microscopic crystals) of a yellowish-brown, very fiery colour,* insoluble in water and in most acids. Nitric acid changes its colour in a very characteristic manner; first into a green, then into a blue and a red tint, and finally decolorizes it entirely. As a general rule, it only occurs in the bile. We shall return to the subject in our remarks on gall-stones. 8. Silica undoubtedly occurs as a precipitate in the animal fluids, but only in such small quantities that it has not hitherto been detected by the microscope.

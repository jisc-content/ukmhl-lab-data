391 CHANGES OF COLOUR. 1. CHANGES OF COLOUR. Every part of the body has in its normal condition a spe- cific colour which depends upon very different causes—solid and fluid pigments—and which may differ considerably within certain limits, without being abnormal. But when the change in the normal coloration exceeds these limits, it becomes pathological; it is, however, neither theoretically, nor prac- tically possible to separate accurately these normal and pathological alterations. Sometime's these changes arc of no importance, but in many cases, they afford valuable aid in recognizing and judging of other pathological condi- tions. It is of course necessary to be well acquainted with the normal colour of the various parts of the body, in order to form a judgment of the changes it has undergone ; and this knowledge, at least in reference to minute shades of difference cannot be learnt from descriptions alone, but must be sought in the frequent observation of nature. Colour in most cases depends upon the blood, which circu- lates through all the vascular parts of the body ; and the changes thus effected are of the highest importance to patho- logy. They generally accord with the changes already described (p. 83—98) in the quantity and distribution ot the blood, and appear as increased or diminished blood-colouring (paleness, and heightened redness) or as an alteration of the normal colour into other shades. Abnormal paleness. This, as a general rule, leads to the conclusion that there is a diminution of the colouring matter of the blood in the part affected; and may depend upon very different causes. i. On a contraction of the capillaries, bv which the quan- tity of the blood-corpuscles, and consequently the intensity of the red colouring is diminished. There are many familiar examples of this state; as, the paleness of the face, in consc-

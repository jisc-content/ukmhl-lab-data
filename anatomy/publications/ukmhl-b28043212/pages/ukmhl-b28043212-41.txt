PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. CHAPTER I. ABNORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF GASEOUS MATTERS. PNEUMATOSES. Abnormal collections of gaseous matter are by no means rare, either in the living or the dead body. They are included in the general term pneumatoses,* and occur in the tissue of organs (constituting emphysema), between the fibres of cel- lular tissue, as in the parenchyma of the lungs or liver; and in the natural cavities of the body, as in the intestinal canal, the peritoneum (constituting tympanites), the pleura (constitut- ing pneumothorax), the pericardium, between the membranes of the brain, or in the cerebral ventricles; in the urinary bladder, the uterus, the heart, and blood-vessels.f They arc most common in the intestinal canal, and comparatively rare in the other cavities.

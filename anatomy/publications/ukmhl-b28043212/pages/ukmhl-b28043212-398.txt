PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 378 considerable evolution of gas. It consisted of carbonate and phosphate of lime with a little magnesia. Two concretions of this nature—the former analysed by Thomson, and the latter by Davy—contained hi 100 parts : 1 2 Phosphate of lime. . 461 56 Ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate. • 5/ Animal matter (fibrin ?). . 25 42 Vegetable fibre, resin, &c. . 24 — 100 98 Sometimes, as has been already mentioned, calculi of this nature form around a foreign body as a nucleus. Children has analysed concretions from the large intestine of a man who had swallowed plum-stones. They were formed of the stones surrounded by a clear brown, smooth, firm mass, consisting of alternate concentric layers of earthy phosphates and fibrous matter (the vegetable fibres derived from the food). The outer portion consisted of: Animal matter soluble in water, with 1 ^5 traces of soluble calcareous salts. . / Phosphate of lime. . .46 Ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate. . 5 Woody fibre. . . .20 Resin (modified bile ?) . .4 100 If the amount of fibrin be increased, these concretions merge into the first class ; if the amount of vegetable matter (remnants of food) be large, they become almost identical with the third class. They are soluble for the most part in acids, which take up their earthy salts. The residue is best examined by the microscope which sometimes enables us to determine the nature and origin of the concretion. 3. Many intestinal concretions consist for the most part of undigested fragments of food, vegetable cells, &c. They fre- quently exhibit a woody appearance, and generally have a foreign body as their nucleus. The following seems to be the mode of their formation: Many portions of our food are absolutely indigestible, as, for instance, hair, epidermis, all the woody parts of the vegetables in general use, the shells and husks of fruit, &c. These can- not be digested, but pass through the system unchanged. It

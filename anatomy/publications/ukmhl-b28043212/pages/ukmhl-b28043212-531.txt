DOUBLE MONSTERS. 511 Supernumerary parts in the intestines, as for instance, supplementary spleens, are noticed in the special part. II. MALFORMATIONS WITH SUPERNUMERARY PARTS, AND MORE THAN ONE HEAD OR TRUNK. The malformations belonging to this division form the so-called double or twin monsters (monstra duplicia, m. bigemina), and triplet monsters (m. trigemina). They may be regarded (anatomically, but not physiologically), as two individuals, whose bodies are adherent, and, to a greater or less extent, fused together in a very symmetrical manner, by the coalition of corresponding parts. The literature on the general relations of these malformations is very abundant. We may especially notice Meckel, op. cit. vol. n. p. 38, Sic. ; Meckel, de duplicitate monstrosa, 1815; Burdach, Sechster Bericht von der anatomischen Anstalt in Kdnigsberg, 1823 ; Barkow, Monstra animalium duplicia per anat. indagata, Lipsiar, vol. i. 1826, vol. ii. 1836; and Bergholz, de monstro dupl. j>er implantat. ac de duplicitate, Berol, 1840. These malformations are further divisible into two groups: in the one, the united individuals arc both equally developed, double monsters by coalition (autositairet, Geoffroy St. Hilaire); in the other, only one individual is especially deve- loped, the second being more or less atrophied; and forming, in a manner, a parasitic appendage to the first, double mon- sters by implantation, (per implantationernâ€”parasitaires, Geoffroy St. Hilaire.) A. DOUBLE MONSTERS BY COALITION. These double monsters may be separated into a great number of forms, of which we must here give only a brief sketch, without entering deeply into their anatomy. They form a connected series from a single individual with a few doubled parts, to two bodies almost com- pletely separated, and only attached at a very circumscribed spot. 1. The duplication may be so inconsiderable, that exter- nally it can be scarcely or not at all perceived, while internal

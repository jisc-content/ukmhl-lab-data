SALIVARY CONCRETIONS. 363 An illustration of the quantitative composition of these concretions is .given by an analysis by Lassaigne. It yielded in 100 parts : Basic phosphate of lime. . . .84.5 Carbonate of lime. .... 0.5 Animal matter (mucus, &c.) . . 15.0 Concretions of similar chemical composition are sometimes ifound in the vesiculse seminales and the vasa deferentia. They are formed, doubtlessly, like prostatic calculi, from the secretion of these glands, when from any cause it contains i more calcareous salts than in the normal condition. A pre- cipitate then occurs, which, under favourable conditions, passes into a concretion. Pcschier found in 100 parts of such a concretion : Phosphate of lime. . . 90 Carbonate of lime. . . 2 Animal mntter. . . 10 Similar concretions are found in the female generative organs, consisting chiefly of earthy phosphates, which an; formed in a similar manner as urinary calculi composed of the same substance. Illustrations: A large calculus in the uterus, the nucleus, of which was a part of the tibia of a fowl, (consequently an incrustation), consisted of phosphate of lime. Another large stone in the uterus consisted of ammoniapo-magnesian phosphate, surrounded by phosphate of lime (Brugnatelli). A concretion from the vagina of an old woman was of a yellowish white colour, and consisted of phosphate of lime with animal matter (mucus ?) which remains in flocculi on dissolving the concretion in | hydrochloric acid. (Thomson).* U. SALIVARY CONCRETIONS. The saliva contains amongst its normal constituents a very small number of those substances which, under favourable circumstances, might give occasion to the formation of an insoluble precipitate. These are the insoluble earthy salts (phosphates of lime and magnesia) whose solution is probably * Lcop. Gmelin, Chemie, ri. 2, 1372.

MALFORMATION'S DEPENDING ON FISSURES. 505 Thoracic fissures (fissura sterni) resolve themselves into those in which, besides the sternum, the skin is also sepa- rated—in which case the thoracic viscera are exposed, and form a prolapsus (prolapse of the heart or lungs); and into those in which the integument is not cleft, and where the protruded thoracic viscera are covered by it (hernia pec- tor alis) . The same holds good regarding abdominal fissures. In the lowest degree, the umbilicus alone is open and the abdominal viscera, to a greater or less degree, protrude through it (congenital umbilical hernia—exomphalus) ; in the highest degree the abdominal walls are completely cleft, and the viscera are more or less exposed and protruded, forming a prolapsus. In some instances the fissure is limited to the lower part of the abdomen, and especially affects the bladder (prolapsus vel inter sio vesica: urinaria:). It generally happens in this case, that the urethra is also cleft on its upper side (epi- spadias). The higher degrees of this malformation are incompatible with viability. The literature of this subject is given in Meckel, vol. i. p. 93 ; Geoffrey 8t. Hilaire* names the whole group Celosomiens.f and reduces them to the following subdivisions : A. The cleft limited to the abdomen. 1. Aepalosomus the fissure and eventration extending chiefly upon the lower part of the abdomen ; the urinary apparatus, genitals, and rectum, opening externally by three dis- tinct orifices. 2. Agenosomusf the fissure and eventration chiefly in the lower part of the abdomen ; urinary and sexual apparatus absent or very rudimentary. 3. t y/losmus,\\ the fissure and eventTation lateral, chiefly in the low er part of the abdomen ; the inferior extremity of the side affected with the fissure, absent or very little developed. 4.

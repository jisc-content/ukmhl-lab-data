443 PARASITIC INSECTS—THE FLEA. II. PARASITIC INSBCTS. Insects have been very frequently observed as incidental parasites in and upon the human body; as the ear-wig (foijicula auricularia), the eggs and larvae (maggots) of dif- ferent species of flies (sarcophaya carnaria, musca cadave- rina, in. Casar, m. vomitoria, &c.), which are sometimes found in foul ulcers, even upon the living body. To those might be added many other species, whose enumeration in this place would carry us too far; we shall revert in the special part to the most interesting of this class of cases. For those who desire to pro- secute this subject, the above-mentioned work of Raspail, Histoire natu- rellc de la sant6, &c., offers an abundant fund of information, which, however, requires to be very cautiously employed.* Of this class the only true human parasites are fleas, lice, and buys. a. pleas, pulicina. The common flea (pulex irritans) lives upon the skin of man, but occasionally forsakes it, particularly in the summer, and is then to be found in gardens and woods, in sand, earth, &c. The female deposits her eggs in putrid materials, manure, saw-dust, decayed vegetable matter, nigs, &c. : sometimes also under the toe-nails of dirty persons. From the eggs, which have the size of a small pin’s head, there are developed minute apodal larvae, which after ten or twelve days become transformed into chrysales. Out of the pupae come the perfect fleas which then subsist as parasites on man and animals. The pathological importance of the common flea is known to every one; whilst piercing the epidermis with its proboscis, it effects, by suction, a small extravasation of blood which appears as a red point surrounded by a paler red areola. * See also SicboW, op. cit. p. 654.

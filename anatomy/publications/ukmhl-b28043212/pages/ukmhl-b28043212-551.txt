531 POST MORTEM CHANGES. u lit ii the force of the circulation has become generally and ocall) so weakened that it can no longer counteract the influence of gravitation upon the blood: this especially applies to the lungs. P To these changes in the distribution of the blood are allied various modifications of the blood itself, which are at present very little understood, with respect to their chemical nature. The most important of them may at present be characterised as a solution of the blood-corpuscles, (that is of their colour- ing matter), which is observed in rare cases during life (see P- /)• In consequence of thus, a red plasma is conveyed into the tissues whence is frequently produced the semblance o a capi ary yptnemia (constituting another division of the death spots). The precise chemical changes of the blood which effect the solution are unknown, for although, as commonly happens, they are properly referred to decomposi- ion or putrefaction, yet this is in reality no explanation of the change. A true explanation would consist in a demonstration of the specud chemical cause which produces the solution of the Uood-corpusdcs. This proof is still wanting, although in tn'tho raSeS ,'-e SdTm ®“ b<' refaTed "ith great probability grncr.ition of carbonate of ammonia in the blood.

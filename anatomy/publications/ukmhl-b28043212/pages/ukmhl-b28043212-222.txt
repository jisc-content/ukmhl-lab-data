PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 202 TUMOURS. When the pathological epigeneses of the elementary tissues, treated of in the preceding pages, do not serve to unite portions of the body severed by wounds, or to restore loss of substance; when further they do not, as in hyper- trophy, increase the mass of an organ by the addition of new substance similar to, and not to be distinguished from the original; but when, on the contrary, the newly formed mass is more or less distinct from the surrounding parts, and when the scalpel of the anatomist can separate it from them and isolate it, such an epigenesis is commonly named a tumour. The idea attached to the word tumour is, however, very inde- finite, and there is no distinct line drawn between tumours and regeneration of lost parts and hypertrophies. Again the tumours occurring in individual cases show an endless variety. There occur as elements in their composition, not only the several tissues of whose epigeneses we have already spoken, but also many others which find no place in the normal body; and these several elements appear in certain cases under infinitely varied combinations. Hence a classification of tumours is extremely difficult, and all attempts to arrange them (as we do animals and plants) into genera and species must necessarily fail; this does not, however, prevent us from ranging them in some sort into groups, in order that we may the more easily proceed in our consideration of them; but we must always bear in mind that there is no definite division between one and another of them, and that through the various combinations of their composite elements, they offer an infinite variety of form. In a histological point of view, tumours may be arranged in two great divisions. To the first belong those whose elements may be considered histologically to agree with those of the normal body, and which further being once formed, discharge

PATHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE BLOOD. 96 difficulty is increased by their frequently occurring together. We may be assured that extravasation has occurred when the redness of a part is not uniform, but distributed in patches, and further, when the specks of blood which we can detect, either with the microscope or the unaided eye, have a larger diameter than the vessels of that part, even when dilated to the utmost. Sometimes other circumstances contribute to strengthen the diagnosis; thus, for instance, there would be great probability in the assumption that blood was extrava- sated in the lungs, if during life the sputa w7ore observed to contain numerous blood-corpuscles, as occurs in pneumonia, or when in the dead body the bronchi were found to contain bloody mucus. Coagulated blood in the ureters, and bloody urine lead to the inference that there has been extravasation in the kidneys. Fortunately in these cases where the diagnosis between these two conditions is not easy, its accurate esta- blishment is of no great value, for each is intimately combined with and keeps up the other, and the extravasation is most commonly produced by hypersemia and stagnation of blood. The difference between the extravasation of blood and the infiltration of hsematin is explained in the following section. Blood effused into the stomach and intestinal canal, and either found there on dissection, or discharged by the mouth or the rectum, has, however, a different character. Instead of being red it is of a brownish black colour, and of the consis- tence of tar, or else flocculent and resembling coffee grounds. Under the microscope there are observed patches of an irre- gular form and size, but of a deep reddish brown colour, like the blood modified by gangrene* and in which no blood- corpuscles can be observed. This appearance is caused by the blood coming in contact with the acid of the gastric juice, * See pi. ix. fig. 10.

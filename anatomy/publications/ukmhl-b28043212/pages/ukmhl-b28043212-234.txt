PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 214 ramifying productions consisting of fatty tissue, and occurring in the joints, especially at the knee joint. Growths of this sort are covered by a prolongation of the synovial membrane, and hang loosely in the ca\ ity of the joint, forming arborescent tufts somewhat swollen at their extre- mities. V. Walther* distinguishes as a peculiar variety, the Ncevus lipomatodes, a lipoma appearing at birth in the subcutaneous fatty tissue, and connected with a change in the cutis. Glugef describes under the name of Lipoma colloides, a particular kind of fatty tumour, upon which I can at present offer no opinion. The chemical relations of fatty tumours may he easily deduced from the foregoing observa- tions. After the preceding observations, it will not be expected that we should attempt a division of fatty tumours into pre- cise species and sub-species; but if it be desired to form a tolerable idea of the several possible and actual forms which they take, or changes which they experience, the following arrangement may be serviceable. The true fatty tumour may pass: 1. Into general infiltration of fat (polysarcia, obesitas), by local hypertrophy of the adipose tissue. 2. Into fibrous tumour, by the accession of areolar tissue. 3. Into encysted tumour, by the production of a decided cyst. * Probably there are occasional transitions into other kinds of tumours, even into those ot a malignant nature. The transition into the vascular tumour is doubtful, since vessels in fatty tumours always play a very subordinate part. In reference to their diagnosis it must be mentioned that many forms of malignant tumour—as encephaloid—have in their physical properties, the greatest similarity to tatty tumours, and can only be distinguished from them by micros- copic examination. For particulars on this subject we must refer to the section on malignant tumours.

PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 126 to organic life, and to certain definite objects—as protec- tion from without, secretion, or absorption—so also in mor- bid processes, we very frequently meet with a species of cellular formation, in which secondary cells which have proceeded from primary cells discharge no functions con- nected with the vital process. These do not remain con- nected with each other, but separate, and are either discharged as foreign matter from the organism, or when this does not or cannot happen, being capable of no further development, gradually break up, until they are at last reduced to a nearly structureless, finely granular mass, which (like any other mass incapable of acting as a cytoblastema) gradually sepa- rates, as far as is possible, from the fluids of the body, and at last for the most part or entirely disappears. A large number of morbid products fall under this head ; for instance pus and what are termed malignant epigeneses, such as tubercle, ence- phaloid, and scirrhus, whose descriptions are subsequently given. 2. The cells may he converted into other forms.— Instead of being converted into secondary persistent cells or being altogether destroyed, the original cells may be con- verted into other structures, which in their perfect state have entirely lost the original cellular form. The processes by which this takes place are very different, depending on the properties of the tissue to be constructed from the cells; they admit, however, of division into two funda- mental types. A. Several cells may be fused together by the uniting of their walls. Thus according to Schwann are formed blood- vessels, nerves and muscular fibre. B. The cells may become divided, each individual cell separating into different parts. This is observed in the development of cellular tissue. We shall enter with more minuteness into the genesis of these struc- tures, when treating of the morbid formations occurring in the individual tissues.

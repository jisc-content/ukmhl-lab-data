GRANULAR PIGMENT. 195 a line in diameter. These molecules are found sometimes singly, sometimes collected together in larger or smaller quantity between and among the elements of the tissue. In some few cases these granules are enclosed in cells.* This pigment has morphologically a great similarity to the first kind, but chemically the two are easily distinguished. It dissolves in acids, (acetic acid, nitric acid, &c.) whilst the first and second kinds are not affected by them. By supersatu- rating the acid solution with hvdrosulphate of ammonia, it apparently returns to its original form, that is, it Is again precipitated as sulphuret of iron. Concentrated acetic acid is the best test, for the other acids, by coagulating the albumen, conceal the minute black granules, just as if they dissolved them. The second and third kinds of morbid pigment-formation, sometimes occur together. On making a microscopic exami- nation, we then observe black granules of sulphuret of iron between the brown patches of altered and coagulated blood, f After the preceding observations, the conditions under which the two last kinds of morbid pigment occur may be easily explained. Acids change the blood-pigment in the, stomach, and probably also in gangrene, since gangrenous fluids frequently have an acid reaction. Sulphuretted hydro- gen and hydrosulphate of ammonia, which frequently occur in the intestinal canal, effect changes in the blood- pigment, either in that canal, or (escaping from it by endos- mosis, or in cases of perforation through the newly formed opening,) upon the surfaces of the spleen and the liver. \\ hen, either simultaneously or independently, the iron of the blood is dissolved, and by means of hydrosulphate of ammonia [ again precipitated, the deposition of sulphuret of iron takes place. But there is still much that is obscure in these processes. How happens it, for example, that the iron of the * See Plate ix. fig. 5. + See Plate ix. fig. 10. o 2

65 pathological kelations of the blood colour of the blood. According to Lobstein,* the blood is thinner than usual in scurvy, in morbus maculosus Werl- hofii, in typhus, in petechial fever, in malignant pustule, in scarlatina, and in measles. It was likewise noticed by â€¢Schererf in puerperal metritis. It appears thicker than usual in cholera, in consequence of the amount of water in the blood being much diminished. Generally speaking, our ; information respecting the variations in the consistence ot the blood are of little value, because their determination has not i been based on accurate principles; and they are even more iunserviceable and deceptive when they refer, not to fluid blood t escaping from the living body, but to the entirely or partially coagulated blood lound on dissection, since the original degree of consistence existing during life is already mo- di tied. This leads to the consideration of deviations in the coagu- lation of the blood. The blood coagulates out of the body in the same manner as in the body after death. In each case the process is essentially the same, although, in the latter there are so many modifying circumstances that it is better that we should consider each phenomenon separately. Blood obtained from the living body, either by opening a vein, or by any other means, may present the following peculiarities in its coagulation. I. The blood may coagulate very rapidly, or, on the other hand, not for some time after its discharge: in some cases it occurs in one and a half minutes; in other cases it only commences after the lapse of fifteen or twenty minutes. This acceleration and retardation of the coagulation cannot be well accounted for; and the causes influencing the rapidity being apparently very complicated, no practical conclusions can as yet be drawn from these phenomena. It appears that it is i hastened, and, indeed, principally caused by the action of the * Path. Aimt. vol. n. pp. 539. t Op. cit. p. 1G0 and 1G3. VOL. 1. F

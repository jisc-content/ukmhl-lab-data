MALFORMATIONS. 524 being on the one side male, and on the other female (herma- phrodismus lateralis). On one side of the body is an ovary, on the other a testicle. For cases see Meckel, vol. n. Part 1, p. 213; Rudolphi, Abhandlun- gen der Berlinen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1825 ; J. C. Meyer, Caspar’s Wochenschr. 1835, No. 7; Berthold, iiber seitliche Zwitter- bildung, Gottingen, 1844, (reprinted from vol. ii. of Abhandlungen der Kdnigl. Gesellsch. der Wissenschaften zu Gottingen). 2. The external genital organs may differ from the inter- nal ; the external being female, the internal male; and less frequently the converse. Most of these cases are probably founded on deception, and belong to false hermaphrodi- tism. 3. Hermaphrodites with increased number of parts; cer- tain male sexual organs are present with a perfect female system, and the converse. A few cases are given in Meckel, vol. ii. p. 215, et seq. All these and some other more recent cases are, however, in the highest degree questionable, and are probably founded upon a false interpretation of the supernumerary parts. Additional matter on congenital malformations of the sexual organs will be found in the special part. As an appendix we may add certain pathological changes of the foetus, which are not commonly classed with con- genital malformations—as tumours and other morbid pro- ducts ; also the alterations which the foetus undergoes when retained in the abdominal cavity in extra-uterine gestation (lithopadion); and various pathological changes of the placenta and membranes of the ovum. Most of these pathological changes are as yet very imperfectly under- stood, and, as in the case of the midformations, a profound considera- tion of them is impossible without entering deeply into the history of development. I am, therefore, content in this place, to refer to a few works which contain more special statements respecting certain of these morbid alterations.

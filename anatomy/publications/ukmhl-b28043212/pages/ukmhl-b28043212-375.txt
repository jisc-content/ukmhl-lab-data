355 CALCULI OF URIC' ACID. Hence for the conversion of protein into uric acid, tin?re are required only 91 equivalents of oxygen. This explains how a diminished quan- tity of oxygen may be the cause of the formation of an extraordinary quantity of uric acid in the body, at the expense of the urea. Extending these considerations to the food, we see how Certain forms of diet favour this uric-acid diathesis. As in the metamorphosis of protein, the greater part is discharged as urea and uric acid, so it cannot be doubted that many kinds of food devoid ot nitrogen, at the termination of their metamor- phoses, are for the most part discharged as carbonic acid and water. More- over, for this purpose a combination with oxygen is necessary, which is supplied to the body by respiration. We may, however, show how different sorts of food require different quantities of oxygen, in order to effect this metamorphosis. Thus 100 parts of starch (= 44.5 C + 6.2 H-f 49.3 O) require : 118.5 parts of oxygen in order to form (163 C O, (44.5 C + 118.5 O). and 55.5 H O (6.2 H +49.3 O). 100 parts of sugar (= 42.2 C + 6.4 H + 51.4 O) require : 112.4 parts of oxygen to yield 154.6 C O, (42.2 C+ 112.4 O), and 57.8 HO (6.4 H + 51.4 O). 100 parts of fat (+= 79 C + 11 H + 9 O) require: 289 parts of oxygen to form 289 CO. (79 C + 210 O), and 99 H O (11 H + 88 O). 100 parts of alcohol (~ 52.2 C + 13 H + 34.8 O) require : 208.4 parts of oxygen to form 191.2 CO, (52.2 C+ 139 O), and 117.2 HO (13 H + 104.2 O). If under certain conditions of life the quantity of oxygen taken into the body be sufficient to convert into urea, carbonic acid, and water, those constituents of the food which consist especially of starch and sugar, together with the protein-compounds, we may easily conceive that in food rich in fat, associated with a free use of alcohol, the oxygen is no longer sufficient for the perfect conversion of the protein- compounds into urea, but that, in the place of the latter, uric acid will be formed. Experience also teaches us, that food, when of a fatty nature, and the copious use of alcohol, together with an imperfect supply of the oxygen necessary to respiration, favour the uric-acid diathesis. At all events, the above observations point out the way which may lead to a true explanation of this formation, although we must not forget tliat there may possibly be many acting intermediate agents with which we are unacquainted, and that the above statement can therefore only be re- garded as hypothetical. 2.

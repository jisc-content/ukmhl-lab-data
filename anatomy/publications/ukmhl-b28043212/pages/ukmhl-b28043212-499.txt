PSEUDOPARASITES. 479 found in the urine ; these, however, were not dis- charged with the urine, but previously existed in the utensil; the like occurs m the faecal evacuations, in vomited matters and in sputa. In some of these cases the deception is inten- tional, and proceeds from the patients who assert that they have discharged these animals, when they have previously cast them into the utensil; sometimes this is done with a view to excite interest, and often from totally inexplicable psycholo- gical motives, the patients having even previously swallowed them, in order more effectually to deceive the physician. 2. The substances supposed to be parasites may indeed have been actually discharged, but are, however, no ani- mals, but other foreign bodies of the most varying description, as seeds and other vegetable matter, morbid products (fibri- nous coagula, See ) In order to escape such errors which even in modern times, occur sufficiently often, whenever the physician entertains a doubt respecting the nature of an eva- cuated body, he should always consult an experienced natu- ralist. It is not our intention to enumerate all the pseudoparasites hitherto met with, but merely, once for all, to caution the physician to be on his guard in such matters, and neither to fall spontaneously into error, nor allow himseli to be deceived by others. A series of pseudoparasites, which might be easily augmented by some more recent examples, has been described by Bremser, and figured in the vignette on the title page of his work.* * Siebold's remarks on tliis subject are well deserving of the atten- tive perusal of every practical physician, op. cit. p. 683.

188 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. cases of hypertrophy and in tumours), manifest on being cut through so close a similarity, in their physical appearance, with cartilaginous tissue, that they are frequently mistaken for it. Both are of milk-white colour, are semi-transparent, apparently homogeneous, and very solid, so as to craunch under the knife. Many morbid growths described both by ancient and modern authors as morbid cartilaginous tissue consisted, without doubt, of this newly formed muscular tissue. The difference between these tissues is perfectly obvious under the microscope. The chemical processes in this epigenesis appear to he extremely simple, for this muscular substance in its chemical properties, and probably, also, in its ultimate composition, differs but slightly from the coagulated protein-compounds. As in the tissues consisting normally of fibrin, there is immense variety in the volume of the fibres, rising gradually from the fibres of areolar tissue, which are the finest and most delicate, and have a diameter varying from the 2000th to the 1200th of a line, to the thickest simple muscular fibres with a diameter varying from the 400th to the 300th of a line; so does the same variety exist in the morbid epigenesis of fibrous tissues. Newly formed fibres are frequently met with, which seem to hold an intermediate place between those of areolar and those of muscular tissue; so that it is no easy matter to decide to which they belong. This is the case in some imperfectly developed formations, The above observations respecting the similarity of many of these formations to cartilaginous substance holds, also, with regard to many of those structures which consist of im- perfectly developed areolar tissue.

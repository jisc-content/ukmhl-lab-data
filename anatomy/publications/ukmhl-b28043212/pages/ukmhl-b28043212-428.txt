408 CHANGES IN PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. | See Plate ix. fig. 9. decomposition seems to be local interruption of the circula- tion, and of the metamorphosis of tissue, as far as is depen- dant upon the circulation, that is to say, in relation to the removal of decomposed matter, infecting the adjacent parts. In other cases, the softening originates in extravasated blood; which, when occurring in large masses, seems more disposed than any other of the constituent parts of the body to undergo decomposition; it influences also the adjacent parts, if its products, in consequence of the large quantity of the extravasation, or owing to local disturbance of the circu- lation, be not carried off, but are able to exercise their influence upon the neighbouring tissues. To this head belong most cases of inflammatory gangrene.* The blood undergoes a peculiar change, being converted into brown or blackish clots, in which granules of sulphuret of iron sometimes appear.f But the chemistry of these changes is almost entirely unknown. The modifications of the different histological elements in these gangrenous softenings are ex- tremely various. The soft tissues, as might be expected, are first altered, and sometimes wholly destroyed. The areolar tissue is either broken up into a fine granular mass, which at first has the form of fibrous bundles, or it is gradually softened, so that larger portions still exhibit the original contour, after the individual connecting fibres have disappeared. The cells of adipose tissue disappear, and their contents become mixed, as drops of fat, with the surrounding fluid; and crystalline masses of margarin or margaric acid generally occur. The primitive bundles of muscles lose by degrees their striated appearance,J and at last become changed into a pale, gelati- nous mass which for a long period retains the external con- * See Wagnerâ€™s Handworterbuch d.

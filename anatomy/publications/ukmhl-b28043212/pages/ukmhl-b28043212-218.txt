PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 198 formed from a fluid cytoblastema—the general fluid of nutri- tion—in accordance with the law of analogous formation. But the formation is very slow, being not complete till five weeks, sometimes till three or more months after the injury. It is much slower than the formation of areolar tissue, blood- vessels, &c. Here as in all tissues of composite struc- ture and of high physiological dignity, the epigenesis is limited, that is, all the fibres that have been destroyed are not again formed, and the regeneration itself only proceeds under favourable conditions. Probably there are similar rela- tions in force here as in the striated muscles previously described. Whether central nervous fibres and nervous corpuscles (ganglionic vesicles) can be again formed, is unknown. That encephaloid is not a morbid production of the nervous system, as was formally supposed, is shown in the section on that subject. Further details concerning hypertrophy of the nerves, nervous tumours (neuroma), regeneration of the substance of the brain, &c., will he given in the special department. EPIGENESIS OF CARTILAGINOUS AND OSSEOUS TISSUES. These two tissues, in relation to their pathological epige- neses, are so intimately connected, that we shall consider f them together. Normal cartilage consists of two elements histologically distinct—the cartilage cells, and an intercellular substance. The latter differs in the different kinds of cartilage; in true cartilage it is amorphous; in fibrous cartilage it consists of fibrous tissue; in other cartilages it exhibits an intermediate character, being sometimes amorphous and slightly channelled, at other times fibrous.* The morbid production of cartilaginous tissue is not un- * Sec Hcnle’s Allgem.

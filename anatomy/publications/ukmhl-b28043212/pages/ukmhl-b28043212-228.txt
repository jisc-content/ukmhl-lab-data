208 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. or after extirpation, it usually appears white and blood- less, because the fluid contents very rapidly escape; but on placing a small portion under the microscope imme- diately after extirpation, the smaller vessels, at the least, will be seen partially filled with blood. A section after being thoroughly washed, is observed either by the naked eye, or by a lens, to have a cribriform appearance, the orifices corresponding with the sections of the divided vessels.* On examining carefully prepared sections under the microscope, the walls of the vessels may be discerned, and between them perfect or partially developed areolar tissue, caudate cells and nuclei. The vessels have usually a tolerably large diameter, being very distended capillaries, small arteries, and small veins; when arteries predominate, the tumours during life exhibit pulsation; and when veins, they present a bluish colour, f Their development depends either on dilatation of the normal capillaries, the ends of arteries and the commence- ment of veins, at first only temporary and produced by the same causes which give rise to local hypersemia and subse- quently becoming permanent; or else on an epigenesis of vessels in the manner previously described. When Telan- giectases form true prominent tumours, in addition to the formation of vessels, there is always an epigenesis of areolar and fibrous tissue. True Telangiectases are never encysted, but are intimately connected with the surrounding parts, and are altogether non-malignant. When they are situated in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, they may sometimes become dangerous, by the gradual tension and attenuation of the skin, by sponta- neous rupture of their vessels, bleeding, inflammation, sup- puration, &c. * J.

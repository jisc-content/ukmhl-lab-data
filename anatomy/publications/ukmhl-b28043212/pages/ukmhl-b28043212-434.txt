COMBINATION OF MORBID CHANGES. 414 escapes detection on account of its small quantity, or of its having been carried off by the activity of the lymphatic vessels. We more frequently meet with serous dropsy without venous hypersemia. This may arise from the fact that the venous hypersemia has already disappeared, while its resultâ€”the serous dropsy still remains; or owing to the dropsy having originated from some other cause than venous hypersemia, (see p. 42). But these causes are still very obscure, and venous hypersemia appears to be by far the most frequent origin of serous dropsy. This group is limited to these two changes, generally speaking the degree of softening produced by serous fluid is only slight, but in the brain, a higher degree of the same change may be occasioned. SECOND GROUP. CAPILLARY HYPERiBMIA AND FIBRINOUS DROPSY. The consequences of these processes form a very compre- hensive department, extending over most of the elementary changes already considered. The two principal links of this department are connected with each other, since fibrinous dropsy, as we have already showrn, is a consequence of capillary hypersemia; but between them there are so many intermediate links, that it appears advisable to separate this department into two divisions. 1. The province of capillary hypercemia, which is in the first place characterized by distension of the capillaries, and an accumulation of blood in them, and further by a stagnation of the corpuscles, and consequently a local stoppage of the circulation (stasis, see p. 88). As consequences of this state there may be laceration of the capillaries, and consequently extravasation of blood. The latter may undergo the changes already described (see p. 93), may be resorbed with or without change of colour, or may act as a cytoblastema for organized, and a plasma for unorganized epigeneses, it may

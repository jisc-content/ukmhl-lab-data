MALFORMATIONS. 486 development, usually occur in twin or triplet pregnancies, is favourable to the view that pressure and confined space are to be regarded as causes of certain monstrosities; for the objec- tion which has been made, that twins and triplets are also born perfectly normal, only shows that, notwithstanding the limited space, a normal development is possible; but not that, under specially unfavourable relations, the presence of a second embryo cannot exercise an interrupting influence upon the development of the other. Of diseases of the foetus which are capable of causing malformations, we at present recognize dropsical accumulations of water in its various cavities—no doubt one of the most frequent causes of hemice- phalia, spina bifida, abdominal fissures, and hernia umbilicahs congenita; inflammation of certain organs at an early period, which through the agency of fibrinous dropsy ma) gi\e lise to union, or even destruction and atrophy of certain parts ; and nervous diseases, inasmuch as they cause spasmodic contrac- tions of individual muscles or muscular groups, and in this way give rise to deformities of the trunk and extremities (curvatures).* The influences alluded to in the preceding observations are, doubtless, those which must be regarded as the most frequent and most important causes of malformations. But it is only rarely that we are able to point out in more minute detail t le manner in which these causes operate. By mere general terms, as “ increased or diminished energy of the formative power,” such as were frequently employed by earlier authors, and which usually are nothing more than an abstract expression of that which the most superficial consideration of a malformation teaches, we must not hope to be able to explain the complicated causes of these changes, or to com- prehend their origin. There is here much untrodden ground for scientific investigators, and the most important results may be expected from their labours. * Several cases of this nature are collected by Henle, Op- cit. p. 9.

CELLULAR FORMATION. 125 in the second division the whole structure breaks up simultaneously with the destruction or removal of the individual cells. a. PERSISTENT CELLS. The chief parts of the human body which in their perfect con- dition are composed of cells, either directly connected with one another, or united by a very minute quantity of intercellular substance, are the epidermis, the epithelia of mucous and serous membranes and of vessels, the internal cellular investment of ducts in glandular organs, and fatty tissue. Moreover, the cartilages (with the exception of fibrous cartilage) belong in some measure to this class, if we regard their structureless intercellular substance. When, by a morbid process, any of the above-mentioned structures are produced anew, the process of epigenesis is exactly the same as that of the original formation in embryo: it follows that the cells formed from the cytoblastema gra- dually assume the form and properties which pertain to the normal cells of the newly formed tissue. Hence the whole change undergone by the original cells consists in this, that they gradually become similar to the cells of the normal tissue which they are to repair. The changes thus occurring in the primary cells may in special cases be very different; they may become flattened and increase in breadth, as in pavement epithelium, or they may increase in length, and assume a conical form, as in cylindrical epithelium. This mode of formation of the persistent cells can be most readily observed in the restoration of destroyed epithelium, as after burns or blisters. We shall notice especial instances when speaking of the epi- genesis of epidermis and epithelia. b. TRANSITORY CELLS. While the above-mentioned persistent cellular forma- tions exist in the normal body and are subservient

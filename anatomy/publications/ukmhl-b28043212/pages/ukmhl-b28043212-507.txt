487 THEIR CLASSIFICATION. A perfect knowledge of the history of development is essential to the clear comprehension of the manner in which a certain cause, by exerting a disturbing influence upon the development, effects a certain malformation. This especially holds good in relation to the numerous forms of malformation in which, by arrest of development at an early stage, some parts of the foetus exhibit forms winch correspond more or less closely with those of an earlier grade of development (arrest of formation).* Since m;dformations may affect the most different parts and organs of the body—sometimes one alone, sometimes several in connection with each other—their number becomes very great; and, in order to regard them in a general point of view, it appears absolutely necessary to arrange them in certain classes. I regard the following classification as the most conformable to the objects of pathological anatomy : 1st Class. Malformations, in which certain parts of the normal body are entirely absent, or are too small.—Monstra defieientia. 2nd Class. Malformations produced by fusion or coales- cence of organs. Coalitio partium—Symphysis. 3rd Class. Malformations, in which parts in the normal state united—as for instance, in the mesial line of the body —are separated from each other—Clefts, fissures. 4th Class. Malformations, in which normal openings are occluded—Atresia. 5th Class. Malformations of excess, or in which certain parts have attained a disproportionate size—Monstra abun- dantia. 6th Class. Malformations, in which one or many parts have an abnormal position—Situs mutatus. 7th Class. Malformations of the sexual organs—Herma- phroditism.

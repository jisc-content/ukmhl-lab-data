132 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. In tumours (in a restricted sense) the newly formed parts are not, as it were, fused into the older, as in hypertrophy, but are more or less separate and independent. This is, however, a mere artificial distinction between hypertrophy and tumour. All these distinctions arc, however, of little service; we shall consequently leave them, and seek to resolve the indivi- dual epigeneses into their elementary phenomena. A classification of the different pathological epigeneses is very difficult in consequence of the various relations in which they stand to each other, and of their frequent transitions from one form into another. In accor- dance with the point of view from which we establish our observation will either the one or the other mode of arrangement be preferred. The surest basement for pathological anatomy is a sound acquaintance with histology, and impressed with that feeling, I intend, in the following pages, to resolve the different morbid formations as completely as possi- ble into their elementary parts, to consider these first in relation to themselves alone, and then as occurring united in large masses (tumours) and thus from that which is simple, to proceed to that which is com- pound. The connexion between the different pathological epigeneses and the relations in which they stand to each other will be afterwards considered.

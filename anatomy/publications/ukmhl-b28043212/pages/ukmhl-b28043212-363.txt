343 PRECIPITATES OF URIC ACID. of uric acid have hitherto only been found in the urine. For the causes giving rise to their formation, we must refer to our observations on urinary calculi. Of the various salts of uric acid, the urate of am- monia demands the fullest consideration. It never occurs in the crystalline form, but always as a finely granular precipitate,* whose granules are sometimes connected bv a tenacious membranous substance. These precipitates are scarcely ever colourless; they present every shade, from a clay or yellowish red tint, to a brownish red or bright rose colour. They are only slightly soluble in cold water, but dissolve more readily on the application of heat, and separate again from the hot saturated solution on cooling. They are insoluble in alcohol and ether ; acids decompose them, liberating the uric acidâ€”a circumstance which greatly aids their diagnosis under the microscope; tor on adding an excess of acid to a precipi- tate ot this nature under the microscope, the granules gra- dually disappear, and are replaced by rhombic tablets of uric acid.f Urate of ammonia existing in the sedimentary form has hitherto been found only in the urine: we shall, there- fore, postpone our observations on its mode of formation till we speak of urinary calculi. File urate of soda is likewise found in a separated condi- tion in the human body, occurring in many of the gouty concretions of which we shall presently speak. For certain other sediments which occur solely in the urine (as those ot cystin, uric oxide, &c.), we must refer to our obser- vations on urinary calculi. 4. Salts of lime.

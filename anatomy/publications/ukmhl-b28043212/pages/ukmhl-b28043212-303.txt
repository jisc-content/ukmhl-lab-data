TUBERCLE. 283 a kind of cicatrix formed of thickened fibrous tissue, and may remain for years in the organism without undergoing further change, or becoming inerusted on its surface. We shall return to this subject in our remarks on concretions. Its relation to the surrounding parts. — Tubercular deposits form either nodules of very varying size, or are continuously distributed through a whole organ, or its greater part. We consequently make a distinction between tubercular nodules and tubercular infiltration; when the former are very minute, not exceeding a millet-seed in size, but yet visible to the naked eye, we name them miliary tubercles. These two forms of tubercular deposit are not separated by any definite limit; there are, howT- ever, the following distinctions whose establishment fre- quently varies in accordance with the subjective opinion of the observer. Neither form of deposit has got a well-defined limit, each usually extending almost imperceptibly into the surrounding healthy tissues, unless in certain cases arrested by some peculiar anatomical arrangement, as in the case of glands. Sometimes, however, a secondary limitation of tubercular deposition is brought about by other pathological epigeneses appearing in the surrounding parts ; this may arise either from the influence of the surrounding tissues on its me- tamorphosis, being stronger at the margin where the amount of deposit is small, than in the centre, and, in this way, other products being formed at the periphery of the mass; or from the deposited tubercle exciting irritation in the surrounding parts, and thus giving rise to a eytoblastema distinct from that of tubercle, and becoming converted into pus and granular cells. Hence at the margin we frequently find histological elements distinct from those in the centre of tubercle—namely pus-corpuscles and gra- nular cells ; we may also expect to see epithelial cells, and other elements of the original normal tissues, which on making a microscopic examination, must not be confounded

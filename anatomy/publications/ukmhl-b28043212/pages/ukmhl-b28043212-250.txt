230 PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. bony case alone remains, as true enchondroma. tor further informa- tion concerning the relation of enchondroma to other tumours occurring in the bones, as well as concerning cartilaginous exostosis, I must refer to the chapter on the bones, in the special part of the work. FIFTH GROUP. TUMOURS CONSISTING CHIEFLY OF OSSEOUS SUBSTANCE. Osseous Tumours. Tumours, in which bony tissue is morbidly formed, present in individual cases such great differences in form and struc- ture that it is impossible, as in most of the forms of tumour which have been considered, to give a general descrip- tion of them. They usually appear in or upon bones, and then' peculiarities can only be clearly elucidated by a compa- rison with other pathological changes which take place in the bones themselves. We will, therefore, leave their detailed consideration to the special part, and confine ourselves here to some of their general relations. It is especially important to distinguish the true from the false or apparent osseous growth. The former presents in its histological and chemical relations, all the characters formerly described (see page 199) as appertaining to true bone; the latter consists of an unorganised deposition of calcareous salts between different histological elements, and belongs to the concretions, under which head it will be treated of at greater length. Most of the so termed ossifications, including those which occur in tumours, belong also to this class, and are not true hony structure. The tumours in which true osseous substance appears, either consist entirely, or for the most part of newly formed bone ; or contain it in smaller proportion, forming, according to the terminology which we have hitherto adopted, combina- tions of the osseous with other forms of tumour. To the former belong the osseous formations unconnected with normal bone, which most frequently occur in tibious

PATHOLOGICAL EPIGENESES. 140 the addition of water, the pus-corpuscles rcassume their origi- nal form and character. Many chemical reagents produce a modifying effect on pus-corpuscles; but when they are applied in a very dilute or very concentrated state, they combine the action of endosmosis or exosmosis with their own peculiar chemical reactions. We shall here give merely the most important reactions, those namely which elucidate the chemical compo- sition of the pus-corpuscles. * Dilute acids render the substance of the capsule transpa- rent, and burst it by endosmosis, hut do not, even by pro- longed action altogether dissolve it. They cause the nucleus to stand clearly out, and for that purpose, dilute acetic acid is the best reagent. Moderately dilute solutions of most of the neutral salts, as of hydrochlorate of ammonia, chloride of sodium, or nitrate of potash gradually dissolve the substance of the capsule and the greater part of the contents, with the exception of the nucleus, and even this they render tumid, so that it loses its shape and outline, and forms an indefinite mass. Solutions of the alkaline carbonates and borax, convert the pus-corpuscles into a viscid mass, and the same effect is more rapidly induced by the caustic alkalies. Both capsules and nuclei disappear and there remain only very minute, dark molecules, with a diameter less than the 1000th of a line. Lehmann and Messerschmidt regard these molecules as nucleoli; I cannot, however, accept this opinion uncondi- tionally, since they are scattered among the half-dissolved pus-corpuscles without any definite order; and further, since they are sometimes absent in pus-corpuscles with undoubted nuclei, and arc present in other abnormal pus-corpuscles in which no nuclei arc apparent; and lastly, since they are * A full and very accurate account of these reactions is given by Leh- mann and Messerschmidt.

369 GALL-STONES. r rather hard, verrucose, and consisted of a rough crust, and a white nucleus It contained: Phosphate of lime. . 50.0 Carbonate of lime. . 12.5 Mucus. . 12.5 Water. . 25.0 100.0 V. PANCRBATIC CALCULI. These are of rare occurrence, but appe;ir to be occasionally 'formed from the pancreatic fluid, in the same manner as sali- vary and laclirymal calculi are formed from their corresponding ^secretions, and they resemble these latter in their chemical composition. Golding Bird has examined a pancreatic calculus which contained in 100 parts : Phosphate of lime. . 80 Carbonate of lime. . . 3 Animal matter. . . 7 90 (Die Hamsedimente, Handbibliothek des Auslandes, edited by Dr. FEckstein, p. 93). Plates of pancreatic calculi are given in Baillie’s engravings, fasc. 5, folate vii. p.,117. VI. GALL-STONES. Under this term are included all concretions which are precipitated from the bile. They appear in all parts of the )iliary apparatus, hut most frequently in the gall-bladder, •arely in the biliary ducts of the liver, in the ductus hepaticus, ■ysticus or choledockus, and in the intestinal canal. Gall-stones exhibit great differences in their chemical com- losition, and vary in a corresponding manner in their physical roperties. Their chemical constituents are as follows : 1. Cholesterin, which may easily lx* recognized by the vol. i. y b

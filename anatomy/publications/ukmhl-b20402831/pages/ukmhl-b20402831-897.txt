731 DESCENT OF THE TESTIS. Mr. Curling believes that the descent of the testis is effected by means of the muscular fibres of the gubernaculum; those fibres which proceed from Poupart's ligament and the Obliquus internus are said to guide the organ into the inguinal canal; those attached to the pubis draw it below the external abdominal ring; and those attached to the bottom of the scrotum complete its descent. During the descent of the organ these muscular fibres become gradually everted, forming a muscular layer, which becomes placed external to the process of the peritoneum, surrounding the gland and spermatic cord, and constitutes the Cremaster. In the female, a small cord, corresponding to the gubernaculum in the male, descends to the inguinal region, and ultimately forms the round ligament of the uterus. A pouch of peritoneum accompanies it along the inguinal canal, analogous to the processus vaginalis in the male : it is called the canal of Nuck. called the funicular process, is often incomplete. For an account of the various conditions produced by such incomplete obliteration (which are of great importance in the pathological anatomy of Inguinal Hernia), the student is referred to the ' Essay on Hernia,' by Mr. Birkett, in ' A System of Surgery,' edited by T. Holmes, vol. iv.

The inner boundary of the opening is on a plane posterior to the outer margin ; of I and behind the level of the femoral vessels; it is much less prominent and denned than the outer, from being stretched over the subjacent Pectineus muscle. It is )us through the saphenous opening that a femoral hernia passes after descending along md the crural canal. ior If the finger is introduced into the saphenous opening while the limb is moved in the ' different directions, the aperture will be found to be greatly constricted on extending ga- the limb, or rotating it outwards, and to be relaxed on flexing the limb and inverting tie it: hence the necessity for placing the limb in the latter position in employing the ter taxis for the reduction of a femoral hernia. k I The iliac portion of the fascia lata, together with its falciform process, should now he is ! removed, by detaching it from the lower margin of Poupart's ligament, carefully dissecting ]je it from the subjacent structures, and turning it aside when the sheath of the femoral vessels t. I is exposed descending beneath Poupart's ligament (fig. 429). 11s 429.â€”Femoral Hernia.

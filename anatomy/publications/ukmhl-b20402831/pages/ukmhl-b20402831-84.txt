GENERAL ANATOMY, lxxviii Spinal Cord.—In the spinal cord, on the other hand, the grey matter is entirely in the interior of the organ, and is collected together into one central mass, while the whole of the white matter is external, and is Fig. XL.—Vertical section through the grey matter of the human cerebellum. Mag- nified about 100 diameters, a, The superficial, so-called molecular, or (better) fibrillar layer, containing in a matrix of fine nerve-networks the dichotomously-branched pro- cesses of the large ganglion-cells of Purkinje, that from the second layer b. The nuclei of the fibrillar layer belongs partly to small ganglion-cells, partly to Deiters' neuroglia-cells. Two branched capillary blood-vessels are seen at the upper part, passing into the grey matter from the free surface ; i.e. from the pia mater. c, nuclear layer containing, in a fine nerve-network, numerous groups of nucleated cells, of which the nuclei only are visible, d, part of white substance. (Klein and Noble Smith.) The nerve-network has been omitted in the larger figure for the sake of clearness. It is seen in B, which shows one of the ganglion-cells of Purkinje with its dichotomously-branched processes, and a portion of the adjoining nuclear and fibrillar layers. Nearer the surface the meshes of the nerve-network become more elongated as if they were stretched out in a direction vertical to the surface. At the surface, however, they are like those here repre- sented, but smaller. A arranged into the various columns and commissures described at p. 467 et sgq. We shall here merely give an account of the intimate structure of the cord, which is condensed from the researches of Dr. Lockhart Clarke.* * Phil.

451 PULMONARY. they are continuous with the ramifications of the pulmonary artery, and, uniting together, form a single trunk for each lobule. These branches, uniting succes- sively, form a single trunk for each lobe, three for the right, and two for the left lung. The vein from the middle lobe of the right lung unites with that from the upper lobe, in most cases, forming two trunks on each side, which open separately into the left auricle. Occasionally, they remain separate; there are then three veins on the right side. Not unfrequently, the two left pulmonary veins terminate by a common opening. Within the lung, the branches of the pulmonary artery are in front, the veins behind, and the bronchi between the two. At the root of the lung, the veins are in front, the artery in the middle, and the bronchus behind. Within the i^ericardium, their anterior surface is invested by the serous la}rer of this membrane. The right pulmonary veins pass behind the right auricle and ascending aorta 3 the left pass in front of the thoracic aorta, with the left pulmonary artery. g g 2

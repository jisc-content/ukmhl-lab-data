THE LUNGS. 697 lungs the bronchial tubes are circular, not flattened, and their constituent elements present the following peculiarities of structure. The cartilages are not imperfect rings, but consist of thin laminae, of varied form and size, scattered irregularly along the sides of the tube, being most distinct at the points of division of the bronchi. They may be traced into tubes, the diameter of which is only one-fourth of a line. Beyond this point, the tubes are wholly mem- 394.â€”The Roots of the Lungs and Posterior Pulmonary Plexus, seen from Behind. branous. The fibrous coat and the longitudinal elastic fibres are continued into the smallest ramifications of the bronchi. The muscular coat is disposed in the form of a continuous layer of annular fibres, which may be traced upon the smallest bron- chial tubes : they consist of the unstriped variety of muscular fibre. The mucous membrane lines the bronchi and its ramifications throughout, and is covered with columnar ciliated epithelium.

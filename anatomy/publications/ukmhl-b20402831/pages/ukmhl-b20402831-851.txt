The Thyro-aryicBnoideus is a broad, flat muscle, which lies parallel with the outer side of the true vocal cord. It arises in front from the lower half of the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and from the crico-thyroid membrane. Its fibres pass horizontally backwards and outwards, to be inserted into the base and anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage. This muscle consists of two fasciculi. The in- ferior, the thicker, is inserted into the anterior angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage, and into the ad- jacent portion of its anterior surface ; it lies parallel with the true vocal cord, to which it is occasionally adherent. The superior fasciculus, the thinner, is inserted into the anterior surface and outer border of the arytenoid cartilage above the preceding fibres; it lies on the outer side of the sacculus laryngis, imme- diately beneath its mucous lining. The Arykenoideus is a single muscle, filling up the posterior con- cave surface of the arytenoid carti- lages. It arises from the posterior surface and outer border of one arytenoid cartilage, and is inserted into the corresponding parts of the opposite cartilage. It consists of three planes of fibres : two oblique and one transverse. The oblique fibres, the most superficial, form two fasciculi, which pass from the base of one cartilage to the apex of the opposite one. The transverse fibres, the deepest and most numerous, pass transversely across between the two cartilages ; hence the Arytsenoideus was formerly considered as several muscles, under the name of trans- versi and obliqui. A few of the oblique fibres are occasionally con- tinued round the outer margin of the cartilage, and blend with the Thyro-arytenoid or the Arytieno- epiglottideus muscle.

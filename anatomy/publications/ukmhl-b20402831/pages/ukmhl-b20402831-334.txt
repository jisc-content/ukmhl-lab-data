ARTICULATIONS. i68 sciatic foramen. Its lower border forms part of the boundary of the perinseum. It is pierced by the coccygeal branch of the sciatic artery. The Lesser or Anterior Sacro-Sciatic Ligament, much shorter and smaller than the preceding, is thin, triangular in form, attached by its apex to the spine of the ischium, and internally, by its broad base, to the lateral margin of the sacrum and coccyx, anterior to the attachment of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, with which its fibres are intermingled. It is in relation, anteriorly, with the Coccygeus muscle; posteriorly, it is covered by the posterior ligament, and crossed by the internal pudic vessels and nerve. Its superior border forms the lower boundary of the great sacro-sciatic foramen; its inferior border, part of the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. These two ligaments convert the sacro-sciatic notches into foramina. The superior or great sacro-sciatic foramen is bounded, in front and above, by the posterior border of the os innominatum ; behind, by the great sacro-sciatic liga- 128.â€”Articulations of Pelvis and Hip.

Above this muscle, the gluteal vessels and superior gluteal nerve emerge from the pelvis; and below it, the ischiatic vessels and nerves, the internal pudic vessels and nerve, and the nerve to the Obturator interims. The inferior or lesser sacro-sciatic foramen is bounded, in front, by the tuber ischii; above, by the spine and lesser ligament; behind, by the greater ligament. It transmits the tendon of the Obturator internus muscle, its nerve, and the internal pudic vessels and nerve. 3. Articulation of the Sacrum and Coccyx. This articulation is an amphiarthrodial joint, formed between the oval surface on the apex of the sacrum, and the base of the coccyx. It is analogous to the

BLASTODERM. cxix Fig". LXXIIL*â€”Diagrams to show the development of the three layers of the blastodermic membrane on transverse sections. A, portion of the ovum with the zona pellucida and the germinal area. B C D E F 6, different stages of development, o, umbilical vesicle. a, amnion, i, intestine, p, peritoneal cavity, bounded by the splanchno-pleural and somato-pleural layers of mesoblast. r, vitelline membrane. 2, external blastodermic layer. 3, middle layer. 4, internal layer. 5, medullary laminae and groove. 5', medullary canal. 6, epidermic laminae. 7, lateral flexures of the amnion. 7', the same almost in contact. 8, internal epithelial layer of the amnion. 9, epidermis of the embryo. 10, chorda dorsalis. 11, vertebral laminae. 12, protovertebrae proper. 13, muscular laminae. 14, lateral laminae. 15, fibro-intestinal laminae. t6, cutaneous laminae. 17, internal fibrous layer of the umbilical vesicle. 18, muscular laminae extend- ing to meet the cutaneous. 19, external layer of the cutaneous laminae. 20, internal laver of the sa me. 21, mesentery. 22, fibrous layer of the intestine. * The dotted lines indicate the parts belonging to the internal blastodermic layer; the plain lines those belonging to the middle ; the interrupted lines those belonging to the external. The embryo has been represented, in this and the following diagram, lying on its back. The natural position is generally assumed to be the reverse.

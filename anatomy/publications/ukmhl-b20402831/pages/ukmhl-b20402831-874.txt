708 THE URINARY ORGANS. circumference of the kidney. Pyramids so formed are called the 'pyramids of Ferrein? They have also been named ' lobules of the kidney,' aud the vessels which run between them ' interlobular.' The student must not confound these with the lobes mentioned on p. 705, of which the foetal kidney is composed. The pyramids of Ferrein are found in the cortical arches only, and were considered by Ferrein as quite distinct; but although they are for the most part separated by interlobular vessels and two rows of Malpighian bodies, yet it is now generally admitted that certain tubes of adjacent lobules intercommunicate. In the columns of Bertini no definite lobular arrangement is said to exist, on account of the absence of straight tubes; the tubuli contorti of those parts meeting the tubuli recti at the base of the Malpighian pyramids, and not at the sides adjacent. 404.*—Transverse Section of Pyramidal Substance of Kidney of Pig, the blood- vessels of which are injected. D a. Large collecting tube, cat across, lined with cylindrical epithelium, b. Branch of collecting tube, cut across, lined with epithelium with shorter cylinders, c and d. Henle's loops cut across, e. Blood-vessels cut across. D. Connective tissue ground-substance. 405.*—Longitudinal Section of Straight Tube. a. Cylindrical or cubical epithelium, b. Membrana propria. 406.*—Longitudinal Section of Henle's Descending- Limb. a. Membi ana propria. b. Epithelium. The Tubuli Uriniferi : their structure. The tubuli uriniferi consist of basement membrane lined with epithelium. In the tubuli contorti it is more or less spheroidal; in the straight tubes and the ascending or larger limb of Henle's loop large and cloudy, being of the cubical variety; whilst in the descending limb it is smaller and transparent, closely resembling the endothelium of blood-vessels. * From the ( Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory.'

TO THE PEE FACE EIGHTH EDITION. rjIHE only changes made in this Edition have been such alterations in the sections on Microscopical Anatomy and on Development as the ever-increasing activity of research in those branches of the science has seemed to require. Some illustrations which appeared necessary for the further elucidation of the text have been borrowed, with permission, from well-known text-books, such as Frey's ' Histo- logy,' Strieker's ' Handbook,' and Quain's 4 Anatomy.'

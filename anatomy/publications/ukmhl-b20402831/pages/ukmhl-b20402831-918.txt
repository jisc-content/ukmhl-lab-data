SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. vein. This vessel is accompanied by numerous lymphatics, which return the lymph from the dorsum of the foot and inner side of the leg and thigh : they terminate in the inguinal glands, which surround the saphenous opening. Diverging from the same point are the superficial epigastric vessels, which run across Poupart's ligament obliquely upwards and inwards, to the lower part of the abdomen; the superficial circumnexa ilii vessels, which pass obliquely outwards along Poupart's ligament to the crest of the ilium : and the superficial external pudic vessels, which pass inwards to the perinseum and scrotum. These vessels supply the subcutaneous areolar tissue and the integument, and are accompanied by numerous lymphatic vessels, which return the lymph from the same parts to the inguinal glands. 427.â€”Femoral Hernia. Superficial Dissection. The superficial inguinal glands are arranged in two groups, one of which is dis- posed above and parallel with Poupart's ligament, and the other below the ligament surrounding the termination of the saphenous vein, and following (occasionally) the course of that vessel a short distance along the thigh. The upper chain receives the lymphatic vessels from the penis, scrotum, lower part of the abdomen, perinseum, and buttock; the lower chain receives the lymphatic vessels from the lower- extremity. The nerves supplying the integument of the region are derived from the ilio inguinal, the genito-crural, and anterior crural. The ilio-inguinal nerve may be found on the inner side of the internal saphenous vein, the terminal branch of the genito-crural nerve outside the vein, and the middle and external cutaneous nerves more external.

THE SKELETON. transverse groove, for the inser- tion of the tendon of the Semi- membranosus; and the posterior surface of the outer one, a flat articular facet, nearly circular in form, directed downwards, back- wards, and outwards, for arti- culation with the fibula. The lateral surfaces are convex and rough : the internal one, the most prominent, gives attach- ment to the internal lateral liga- ment. The Shaft of the tibia is of a triangular prismoid form, broad above, gradually decreasing in size to the commencement of its lower fourth, its most slender part where fracture most fre- quently occurs ; it then enlarges again towards its lower extre- mity. It presents for examina- tion three surfaces and three borders. The anterior border, the most prominent of the three, is called the crest of the tibia, or, in popular language, the shin; it commences above at the tubercle, and terminates below at the anterior margin of the inner malleolus;. This border is very prominent in the upper two- thirds of its extent, smooth and rounded below. It presents a very flexuous course, being curved outwards above, and in- wards below; it gives attachment to the deep fascia of the leg. The internal border is smooth and rounded above and below, but more prominent in the centre; it commences at the back jjart of the inner tuberosity, and terminates at the posterior border of the internal malleolus; its upper part gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the knee to the extent of about two inches, and to some fibres of the Pop liteus muscle; its middle third, to some fibres of the Soleus and Flexor longus digitorum muscles. The external border, or inter- osseous ridge, is thin and pro- minent, especially its central j IO>â€”Bones of the Right Leg. Posterior Surface. Styloidjiroecss

THE ABDOMEN. 627 in which they are contained, are covered by an extensive and complicated serous membrane, the peritoneum. The apertures found in the walls of the abdomen, for the transmission of struc- tures to or from it, are the umbilicus, for the transmission (in the foetus) of the umbilical vessels; the caval opening in the Diaphragm, for the transmission of the inferior vena cava; the aortic opening, for the passage of the aorta, vena azygos, and thoracic duct; and the oesophageal opening, for the cesophagus and pneumogastric nerves. Beloiv, there are two apertures on each side : one for the passage of the femoral vessels, and the other for the transmission of the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female. 344.â€”The Regions of the Abdomen and their Contents (Edge of Costal Cartilages in dotted outline.) Regions. For the convenience of description of the viscera, as well as of reference to the morbid condition of the contained parts, the abdomen is artificially divided into nine regions. Thus, if two circular lines are drawn round the body, the one parallel with the cartilages of the ninth ribs, and the other with the highest point of the crests of the ilia, the abdominal cavity is divided into three zones, an upper, a middle, and a lower. If two parallel lines are drawn from the cartilage of the eighth rib on each side, down to the centre of Poupart's ligament, each of these zones is subdivided into three parts, a middle and two lateral. The middle region of the upper zone is called the epigastric {kiri, over ; yaffri'ip, the stomach); and the two lateral regions, the right and left hypochondriac (vtto, under; yovcpoi, the cartilages), The central region of the middle zone is the um- bilical ; and the two lateral regions, the right and left lumbar. The middle region of the lower zone is the hypogastric or pubic region ; and the lateral regions are the s s 2 1.

SEVENTH. FACIAL. eating with which, it accompanies it to the submaxillary gland ; it then joins the submaxillary ganglion, from whence it has been traced by some anatomists into the proper muscular fibres of the tongue—the Lingualis muscle. The Posterior auricular nerve arises close to the stylo-mastoid foramen, and passes upwards in front of the mastoid process, where it is joined by a filament from the auricular branch of the pneumogastric, and communicates with the deep branch of the auricularis magnus ; as it ascends between the meatus and mastoid process it divides into two branches. The auricular branch supplies the Retrahens aurem. 284.—The Nerves of the Scalp, Face, and Side of the Neck. The occipital branch, the larger, passes backwards along.the superior curved line of the occipital bone, and supplies the occipital portion of the Occipito-frontalis, com- municating with the occipitalis minor nerve. The Stylo-hyoid is a long slender branch, which passes inwards, entering the Stylo-hyoid muscle about its middle ; it communicates with the sympathetic filaments on the external carotid artery. The Digastric branch usually arises by a common trunk with the preceding; it divides into several filaments, which supply the posterior belly of the Digastric • one of these perforates that muscle to join the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The Temporo-facial, the larger of the two terminal branches, passes upwards and forwards through the parotid gland, crosses the neck of the condyle of the jaw, being

THE NERVES. xci of the cylinder. Short muscular fibres generally have only one nerve-end, while longer fibres have several.5 It is right, however, to state that the most eminent English authority on this subject entirely denies the description above given, and ex- plains the appearances, figured by Kiihne and others, in a different manner. In a very interesting paper by Dr. Beale, published in 1867,* Fig. LILâ€”Terminations of motor nerves, according- to Beale. 1, nerve-tuft on the sarcolemma of a muscular fibre ; chameleon. Nerve-fibres are seen passing- out of as well as into tlie tuft. 2, nerve-fibres distributed to elementary muscular fibre ; chameleon, x 3000, and reduced half. This is a very simple form of * nerve-tuft' clearly external to the sarcolemma. 3, the intimate structure of a very simple 4 nerve-tuft' on a muscular fibre of the chameleon. It will be observed that the nerve-fibres are continuous through- out, and that the whole is on the surface of the sarcolemma, x 3000. This ' nerve-tuft ' is, as it were, but a compound network. he endeavours to show that the nerve-hillocks of Doyere are merely accidental elevations produced by the sarcolemma being drawn up in a cone, as the neiwe which is attached to it is stretched by the manipula- tion of the observer; and with reference to the end-plates of Kiihne, he asserts that by his own method of examination he is able to follow the nerve-fibrils much beyond the point at which that author describes them as terminating.

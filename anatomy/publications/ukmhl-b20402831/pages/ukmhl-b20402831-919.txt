753 THE CRIBRIFORM FASCIA. The deep layer of superficial fascia should be divided in the same direction as the external incisions, and separated from the fascia lata ; this is easily effected from its extreme thinness. It is a thin but dense membrane, placed beneath the subcutaneous vessels and nerves, and upon the surface of the fascia lata. It is intimately adherent above to the lower margin of Poupart's ligament, and about one inch below this liga- ment covers the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, is closely united to its circum- ference, and is connected to the sheath of the femoral vessels corresponding to its under surface. The portion of fascia covering this aperture is perforated by the internal saphenous vein, and by numerous blood and lymphatic vessels; hence it has been termed the cribriform fascia, the openings of these vessels having been likened to 428.â€”Femoral Hernia, showing Fascia Lata and Saphenous Opening. the holes in a sieve. The cribriform fascia adheres closely both to the superficial fascia and the fascia lata, so that it is described by some anatomists as a part of the fascia lata, but is usually considered (as in this work) as belonging to the superficial fascia. It is not till the cribriform fascia has been cleared away, that the saphenous opening is seen, so that this opening does not, in ordinary cases, exist naturally, but is the result of dissection. Mr. Callender, however, speaks of cases in which, pro- bably as the result of pressure from enlarged inguinal glands, the fascia has become atrophied, and a saphenous opening exists independent of dissection.* A femoral hernia, in passing through the saphenous opening, receives the cribriform fascia as one of its coverings. The deep layer of superficial fascia, together with the cribriform fascia, having been removed, the fascia lata is exposed. * Anatomy of Femoral Rupture, note on p. 18. 3 C '

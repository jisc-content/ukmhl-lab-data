THE ALLANTOIC cxxv those matters which are necessary for its purification. The allantois is formed by a projection of the internal germinal layer (hypoblast), taking with it the splanchnopleural layer of the mesoblast, in which latter the vessels are formed which constitute its most important part. It is at first a mere hollow projection out of the common intestinal cavity (fig. LXXIV. c), but it soon extends into and through the pleuro-peritoneal space till it meets with the primitive chorion, and to this it contributes its essential foetal portion, the fibrous or vascular layer of the allantois.

The Wolffian duct and tubes are not represented. The epithelial or internal portion of the allantois, formed by the hypo- blast, is hollow, and is usually styled the allantoic vesicle. The part of the allantoic vesicle outside the embryo soon withers and disappears in the human foetus, while the vascular part grows and developes into the umbilical cord. The part of the allantois internal to the embryo forms, or contributes to form, the bladder below, while its upper portion becomes impervious, and is called the urachns. In the embryos of those animals in which the whole yolk-sac is taken up into the body of the embryo, there is no amnion and no allantois ; but whenever the amnion is formed an allantois is also formed. In the

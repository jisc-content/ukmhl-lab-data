603 COCHLEA. scalce—viz. the Scala Tympani, the Scala Vestibuli, and, interposed between these, the Scala Media. Projecting from the modiolus is a thin bony process, the lamina spiralis ossea, which consists of two thin lamellae of bone, between which are numerous canals for the passage of nervous filaments. Near the point where the osseous lamina is attached to the modiolus is a small canal, denominated by Rosenthal the canalis spiralis modioli, and occupied by a swelling of the cochlear nerve, in which ganglion-cells are found, the ganglion spirale, from which the nerves pass to the osseous lamina and organ of Corti. The osseous lamina extends only part of the distance between the modiolus and the outer bony wall of the cochlea. Near its outer end the periosteum swells up into an elevation which is called the limbus laminm spiralis (' denticulate lamina ' of Todd and Bowman), and this terminates in a grooved border, the sulcus spiralis, (fig. 326), the edges of the groove being called the labium tympanicum and labium vestibulare respectively. From the labium tympanicum a thin membrane extends over to the bony wall of the cochlea, completing the scala tympani. This membrane is called the membrana basilaris. At its outer attachment it swells out so as to form a thick triangular structure which was regarded as a muscle by Todd and Bowman (cochlearis), but is now recognised as ligamentous—the ligamentum spirale. Between the labium vestibulare and the attachment of the membrane of Reissner, presently to be described, a very delicate membrane extends over to the outer wall of the cochlea, running nearly parallel to the membrana basilaris. It was described by Corti, and covers over the organ which is called after his name, and is therefore called the membrana tectoria or membrane of Corti. Further inwards, near the commencement of the limbus laminae spiralis, another delicate membrane, the mem- brane of Eeissner, is attached to the vestibular surface of the periosteum of the osseous lamina, and stretches across to the outer wall of the cochlea. The canal which lies below the osseous lamina and membrana basilaris is the scala tympani; that which is bounded by the osseous lamina and membrane of Reissner the scala vestibuli : while the space between the membrane of Reissner and membrana ba- silaris is generally described as the Scala media, Canalis membranacea or Canalis cochlea?, and this is the nomenclature which will be used here. Others, however apply the name Canalis cochleaz only to the canal lying between the membrane of

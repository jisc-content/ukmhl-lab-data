FASCIAE OF THE THIGH. 297 191.â€”Muscles of Femor the Iliac and Anterior al Regions. small blood and lymphatic vessels : hence the name cribriform fascia, which has been applied to it. Subcutaneous bursa? are found in the superficial fascia over the patella, point of the heel, and pha- langeal articulations of the toes. The deep fascia of the thigh is exposed on the removal of the superficial fascia, and is named, from its great extent, the fascia lata; it forms a uniform investment for the whole of this region of the limb, but varies in thickness in different parts; thus, it is thicker in the upper and outer part of the thigh, where it receives a fibrous expansion from the Gluteus maxi- mus muscle, and the Tensor vaginas femoris is inserted between its layers : it is very thin behind, and at the upper and inner part, where it covers the Adductor muscles, and again becomes stronger around the knee, receiving fibrous expansions from the tendon of the Biceps externally, and from the Sartorius, Gracilis, Semitendi- nosus, and Quadriceps extensor cruris in front. The fascia lata is attached, above, to Poupart's ligament, and the crest of the ilium ; behind, to the margin of the sa- crum and coccyx ; internally, to the pubic arch, and linea ilio-pectinea ; and below to all the prominent points around the knee- joint, the condyles of the femur, tubero- sities of the tibia, and head of the fibula. That portion which invests the Gluteus medius (the Gluteal aponeurosis) is very thick and strong, and gives origin, by its inner surface, to some of the fibres of that muscle; at the upper border of the Gluteus maximus, it divides into two layers, the upper of which, very thin, covers the surface of the Gluteus maxi- mus, and is continuous below with the fascia lata : the deep layer is thick above, where it blends with the great sacro- sciatic ligament, thin below, where it se- parates the Gluteus maximus from the deeper muscles. From the inner surface of the fascia lata are given off two strong intermuscular septa, which are attached to the whole length of the linea aspera : the external and stronger one, which extends from the insertion of the Gluteus maximus toHhe outer condyle, separates the Vastus externus in front from the short head of the Biceps behind, and gives partial ori- gin to those muscles; the inner one, the thinner of the two, separates the Vastus internus from the Adductor muscles. 2*

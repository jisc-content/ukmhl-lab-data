NERVOUS SYSTEM. 492 corpora quadrigemina, pineal gland, and optic thalami. It is of a triangular form, and separates the under surface of the body of the fornix from the cavity of the third ventricle. Its posterior border forms an almost complete investment for the pineal gland. Its anterior extremity, or apex, is bifid; each bifurcation being continued into the corresponding lateral ventricle, behind the anterior crura of the fornix, forming the anterior extremity of the choroid plexus. On its under surface are two vascular fringes, which diverge from each other behind, and project into the cavity of the third ventricle. These are the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle. To its lateral margins are connected the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles. The arteries of the velum interpositum enter from behind, beneath the corpus callosum. Its veins, the venae Galeni, two in number, run along its under surface; they are formed by the venae corporis striati and the veins of the choroid 272.â€”The Third and Fourth Ventricles. plexuses; the venae Galeni unite posteriorly into a single trunk, which terminates in the straight sinus. The velum interpositum should now he removed. This must he effected carefully, especially at its posterior part, where it invests the pineal gland ; the thalami optici will then he exposed with the cavity of the third ventricle between them (tig. 272). The thalami optici are two large oblong masses, placed between the diverging portions of the corpora striata; they are of a white colour superficially; internally they are composed of white fibres intermixed with grey matter. Each thalamus rests upon its corresponding crus cerebri, which it embraces. Externally, it is bounded by the corpus striatum, and taenia semicircularis; and is continuous with the hemisphere. Internally, it forms the lateral boundary of the third ventricle;

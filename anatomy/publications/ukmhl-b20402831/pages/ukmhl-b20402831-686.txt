CRANIAL NERVES, 520 Accessory,^ wall, and divides into three branches surface of the promontory. Its branches of distribution are, one fenestra ovalis, and one to the lining membrane of the Eustachian tube and tym- panum. Its branches of commu- nication are three, and oc- cupy separate grooves on the surface of the promon- tory. One of these arches forwards and downwards to the carotid canal to join the carotid plexus. A second runs vertically upwards to join the greater superficial petrosal nerve, as it lies in the hiatus Fallopii. The third branch, the lesser petrosal, runs upwards and forwards towards the an- terior surface of the petrous bone, and passes through a small aperture in the sphe- noid and temporal bones, or through the foramen ovale, to the exterior of the skull, where it joins the otic ganglion. This nerve, in its course through the temporal bone, passes by which are contained in grooves upon the to the fenestra rotunda, one to the 286.â€”Coarse and Distribution of the Eighth Pair of Nerves.

The branches of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve are the carotid, pharyngeal, muscular, tonsillar, and lingual. The carotid branches descend along the trunk of the internal carotid artery as far as its point of bifur- cation, communicating with the pharyngeal branch of the pneumogastric, and with branches of the sympa- thetic. The 'pharyngeal branches are three or four filaments which unite opposite the Middle constrictor of the pharynx with the pharyn- geal branches of the pneu- mogastric, the external laryngeal, and sympathetic nerves, to form the pharyngeal plexus, branches from which perforate the muscular coat of the pharynx to supply the muscles and mucous membrane.

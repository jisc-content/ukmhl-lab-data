496 NERVOUS SYSTEM. The median lobe is the fundamental part, and in some animals, as fishes and reptiles, the only part which exists; the hemispheres being additions, and attaining their maximum size in man. The hemispheres are separated, in front, by a deep notch, the incisura cerebelli anterior, which encircles the corpora quadrigemina behind; they are also separated by a similar notch behind, the incisura cerebelli posterior, in which is received the upper part of the falx cerebelli. The superior vermiform process (upper part of the median lobe of the cerebellum) extends from 273.—Upper Surface of the Cerebellum. the notch on the anterior to that on the posterior border. It is divided into three lobes : the lobulus centralis, a small lobe, situated in the incisura anterior; the 711011- ticulus cerebelli, the central projecting part of the process; and the commissura sim- plex, a small lobe near the incisura posterior. The under surface of the cerebellum (fig. 274) is subdivided into two lateral hemispheres by a depression, the valley, which extends from before backwards in the middle line. The lateral hemispheres are lodged in the inferior occipital fossa? • 274.—Under Surface of the Cerebellum. the median depression, or valley, receives the back part of the medulla oblongata, is broader in the centre than at either extremity, and has, projecting from its floor, part of the median lobe of the cerebellum, called the inferior vermiform process. The parts entering into the composition of this body are, from behind forwards, the commissura brevis, situated in the incisura posterior; in front of this, a laminated conical projection, the pyramid; more nnteriorly, a larger eminence,

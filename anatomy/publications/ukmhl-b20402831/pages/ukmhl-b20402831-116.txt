Tins kind of epithelium is found on the surface of the skin (epidermis), on all the serous surfaces (unless the ventricles of Fig. LXIII.—Epithelial cells in the oral cavity of man. a. large, b, middle-sized, c, the fame with, two nuclei.

The nails, hairs, and in animals the horns, are a variety of this kind of epithelium. The columnar epithelium (fig. LXIV.) is formed of cylindrical or rod- Fig. LXIV.—Epithelium of the intestinal villi of the rabbit, a, basement-membrane.

It is usually spoken of in German works as endothelium. It is represented in fig. LY.

HEART—RIGHT AURICLE. 667 right and left, by two longitudinal furrows, the interventricular grooves, which are situated one on the anterior, the other on the posterior surface : these extend from the base to the apex of the organ; the former being situated nearer to the left border of the heart, and the latter to the right. It follows, therefore, that the right ventricle forms the greater portion of the anterior surface of the heart, and the left ventricle more of its posterior surface. Each of these cavities should now be separately examined. The Right Auricle is a little larger than the left, its walls somewhat thinner, measuring about one line; and its cavity is capable of containing about two ounces. It consists of two parts, a principal cavity, or sinus, and an appendix auriculae. 378.—The Right Auricle and Ventricle laid open, the Anterior Walls of both being removed. The sinus is the large quadrangular cavity, placed between the two vense cavse ; its walls are extremely thin ; it is connected below with the right ventricle, and internally with the left auricle, being free in the rest of its extent. The appendix auriculae, so called- from its fancied resemblance to a dog's ear, is a small conical muscular pouch, the margins of which present a clentated edge. It projects from the sinus forwards and to the left side, overlapping the root of the pulmonary artery. To examine the interior of the auricle, a transverse incision should he made along its ventricular margin, from its right border to the appendix ; and from the middle of this, a second incision should be carried upwards, along the inner side of the two vense cav£e. The following parts present themselves for examination :— Superior cava. Inferior cava. Openings. \ Coronary Sinus. Valves. \ Foramina Thebesii. A uriculo- ventricular. Relics of fcetal f Annulus ovalis structure. \ Fossa ovalis. Musculi pectinati. Eustachian. Coronary.

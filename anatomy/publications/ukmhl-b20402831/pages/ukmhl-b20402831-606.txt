VEINS. 44© 545- the following : The communicating- branch between the two trunks enlarges and forms the future left innominate vein ; the remaining part of the left trunk is obliterated as far as the heart, where it remains pervious, and forms the coro- nary sinus; a remnant of the obliterated vessel is seen in adult life as a fibrous band passing along the back of the left auricle and in front of the root of the left lung, called by Mr. Marshall the vestigial fold of the pericardium. —The Venae Cavse and Azygos Veins, with their Formative Branches. 4 n ttrio/• Jitgr/fnr Externa! Jtigulcvf The internal mammary veins, two in number to each artery, follow the course of that vessel, and receive branches corre- sponding with those de- rived from it. The two veins of each side unite into a single trunk, which terminates in the innomi- nate vein. The inferior thyroid veins, two, frequently three or four in number, arise in the venous plexus on the thyroid body, communicat- ing with the middle and superior thyroid veins. The left one descends in front of the trachea, behind the Sterno-thyroid muscles, communicating with its fellow by transverse branches, and terminates in the left vena innomi- nata. The right one, which is placed a little to the right of the median line, opens into the right vena innominata, just at its junction with the superior cava. These veins receive tracheal and inferior laryn- geal branches, and are provided with valves at their termination in the innominate veins. The Superior Inter- costal Veins return the blood from the upper in- tercostal spaces. The right superior in- tercostal, much smaller than the left, closely corre- sponds with the superior intercostal artery, receiv- ing the blood from the first,

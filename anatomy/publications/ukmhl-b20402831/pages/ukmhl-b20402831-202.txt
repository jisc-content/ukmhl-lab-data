These sinuses do not \ i exist in children, but they increase in size as age advances. They are partially 1 closed, in front and below, by two thin curved plates of bone, the sphenoidal -Sphenoid Bone.

The lateral margins of this surface present a! serrated edge, which articulates with the os planum of the ethmoid, completing^ the posterior ethmoidal cells; the lower margin, also rough and serrated, articu-,2 lates with the orbital process of the palate bone; and the upper margin with thefliiij orbital plate of the frontal bone. The inferior surface presents, in the middle line, a triangular spine, the rostrum, which is continuous with the vertical plate on the anterior surface, and is received into a deep fissure between the alse of the vomer.; in On each side may be seen a projecting lamina of bone, which runs horizontally inwards from near the base of the pterygoid process: these plates, termed the: vaginal processes, articulate with the edges of the vomer. Close to the root of the pterygoid process is a groove, formed into a complete canal when articulated! with the sphenoidal process of the palate bone; it is called the pterygopalatine! canal, and transmits the pterygo-palatine vessels and pharyngeal nerve. The Greater Wings are two strong processes of bone, which arise from the sides of ! the body, and are curved in a direction upwards, outwards, and backwards; beingi prolonged behind into a sharp-pointed extremity, the spinous process of the sphenoid. Each wing presents three surfaces and a circumference. The superior or cerebral surface (fig. 34) forms part of the middle fossa of the skull; it is deeply con- cave, and presents eminences and depressions for the convolutions of the brain- At its anterior and internal part is seen a circular aperture, the foramen rotundum; for the transmission of the second division of the fifth nerve. Behind and ex- ternal to this is a large oval foramen, the foramen ovale, for the transmission of % the third division of the fifth nerve, the small meningeal artery, and, sometimes, the small petrosal nerve.f At the inner side of the foramen ovale, a small aperture may occasionally be seen opposite the root of the pterygoid process; it is the foramen * In this figure, both the anterior and inferior surfaces of the body of the sphenoid horn are shown, the boae being held with the pterygoid processes almost horizontal. t The small petrosal nerve sometimes passes through a special foramen between tht'i foramen opale and foramen spinosum.

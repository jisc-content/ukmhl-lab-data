ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 636 great omentum and abdominal parietes; and connected to the spine by a fold of peritoneum, the mesentery. The small intestine is divisible into three portions : the duodenum, the jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum has received its name from being about equal in length to the breadth of twelve fingers (eight or ten inches). It is the shortest, the widest, and the most fixed part of the small intestine; it has no mesentery, and is only partially covered by the peritoneum. Its course presents a remarkable curve, somewhat like a horseshoe in form ; the convexity being directed towards the right, and the con- cavity to the left, embracing the head of the pancreas. Commencing at the pylorus, 349.—Relations of the Duodenum. (The Pancreas lias been cut away, except its head.) it ascends obliquely upwards and backwards to the under surface of the liver • it then descends in front of the right kidney, and passes nearly transversely across the front of the spine, terminating in the jejunum ou the left side of the second lumbar vertebra. Hence the duodenum has been divided into three portions : ascending, descending, and transverse. The first, or ascending portion (fig. 349), about two inches in length, is free, moveable, and nearly completely invested by the peritoneum, which forms the lesser omentum. It is in relation, above and in front, with the liver and neck of the gall-bladder ; behind, with the vessels which run between the layers of the lesser omentum, viz. the hepatic artery and duct, and vena portse. This portion of the intestine is usually found, after death, stained with bile, especially on its anterior surface.

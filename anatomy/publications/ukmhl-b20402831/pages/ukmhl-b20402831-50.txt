xlvi GENERAL ANATOMY. tendons and most of the ligaments are also formed almost entirely of the white fibrous tissue, but with some elastic fibres intermixed. The basis of the serous and mucous membranes is formed of connective tissue, disposed in a layer. The common subcutaneous cellular or cellulo-adipose tissue has been taken above as the typical form from which to describe connective tissue. Connective tissue also enters largely into the formation of the blood-vessels, glands, and, in fact, almost every organ in the body. The organs which are formed almost exclusively of the yellow elastic tissue are the ligamenta subflava of the vertebrse, the elastic ligaments of Fig. X.—Connective tissue. (Klein and Noble Smith.) a, the white fibrous element— a layer of more or less sharply-outlined, parallel wavy bundles of connective tissue fibrils. On the surface of this layer is b, a network of fine elastic fibres. the larynx, the longitudinal elastic fibres of the trachea, the elastic layer of the middle coat of the arteries, and in quadrupeds the ligamentum nuchse. Free cells are found in the areolar tissue, as indicated above. The chief forms are the spindle-shaped and the stellate, but numerous inter- Fig. XI.—Connective tissue corpuscles.

The other two are the ordinary branched cells, each with an oblong nucleus. mediate forms are described by recent observers ; and of late much interest has been excited by v. Recldingshausen's discovery in the cellular tissue of cold-blooded animals of * wandering cells,' or cells endowed with the power of automatic motion, and of changing their shape. These cells appear identical with the white globules of the blood; and it would seem

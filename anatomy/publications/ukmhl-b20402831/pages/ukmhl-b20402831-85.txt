SPINAL CORD. lxxix The white substance of the cord consists of transverse, oblique, and lon- gitudinal fibres, with blood-vessels and connective tissue. The transverse fibres proceed from the grey substance, and form with each other a kind of plexus between the bundles of longitudinal fibres, with which many are continuous ; while others reach the surface of the Fig. XLT.—Transverse section through the cervical portion of the spinal cord of a calf, mag- nified 40 diameters, w, the white matter of the cord, subdivided by septa of connective tissue s, extending from the pia mater to the grey matter, which is seen in the interior with its ganglion-cells. The dots around this show divided nerve-fibres, which exist, but are not shown in the other parts of the white substance. The central canal is seen in the grey matter.

Within the grey substance they are continuous with the roots of the nerves, with the processes of the nerve-cells, and with the anterior and posterior com- missures. The oblique fibres proceed from the grey substance both upwards and downwards ; they form the deep strata of the white columns, and, after running a variable length, become superficial. The longitudinal fibres are more superficial, run nearly parallel with each other, and form the greater portion of the white columns.

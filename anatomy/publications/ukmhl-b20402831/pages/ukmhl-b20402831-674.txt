5o8 CRANIAL NERVES. maxillary bone, and joins opposite the canine fossa with the anterior dental. Numerous lilaments are given off from the lower border of this nerve, which form a minute plexus in the outer wall of the superior maxillary bone, immediately above the alveoli. From this plexus filaments are distributed to the pulps of the molar and second bicuspid teeth, the lining membrane of the antrum, and corresponding portion of the gums. The anterior branch is distributed to the gums and Buccinator muscle. The anterior dental, of large size, is given off from the superior maxillary nerve just before its exit from the infraorbital foramen • it enters a special canal in the anterior wall of the antrum, and anastomoses with the posterior dental. From this nerve some filaments are distributed to the incisor, canine, and first 280.—Distribution of the Second and Third Divisions of the Fifth Nerve and Submaxillary Ganglion. bicuspid teeth ; others are lost upon the lining membrane covering the fore part of the inferior meatus. In this situation it forms the communication with a nasal branch from Meckel's ganglion called the ganglion of Bochdalek. The palpebral brandies pass upwards beneath the Orbicularis palpebrarum. They supply this muscle, the integument, and conjunctiva of the lower eyelid with sensation, joining at the outer angle of the orbit with the facial nerve and malar branch of the orbital. The nasal branches pass inwards ; they supply the muscles and integument of the side of the nose, and join with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic. The labial brandies, the largest and most numerous, descend beneath the Levator

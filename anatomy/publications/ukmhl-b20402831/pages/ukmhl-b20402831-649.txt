BASE OF THE BRAIN. 483 the third ventricle. It connects the genu, or reflected portion, of the corpus cal- losum with the optic commissure, and is on this account described by Sappey as the grey root of the optic nerves. The olfactory nerve, with its bulb, is seen on either side of the longitudinal fissure, upon the under surface of each anterior lobe. The fissure of Sylvius separates the anterior and middle lobes, and lodges the middle cerebral artery. At its commencement is seen a point of medullary sub- stance, corresponding to a subjacent band of white fibres, connecting the anterior and middle lobes, and called the fasciculus unciformis ; on following this fissure outwards, it divides into two branches, which enclose the triangular-shaped promi- nent cluster of isolated convolutions {gyri operti) called the island of Reil. 267.â€”Base of the Brain. FRONTAL LOBE PARIETAL LOBS POST* DIVISION OF SYLVIAN FISSURE TEMPORO-SPHEW OCCIPITAL LOBE The anterior perforated space is situated at the inner side of the fissure of Sylvius. It is of a triangular shape, bounded in front by the convolutions of the anterior lobe and the roots of the olfactory nerve ; behind, by the optic tract; ex- ternally, by the middle lobe and commencement of the fissure of Sylvius; internally, it is continuous with the lamina cinerea, and crossed by the peduncle of the corpus callosum. It is of a greyish colour, and corresponds to the under surface of the cor- pus striatum, a large mass of grey matter, situated in the interior of the brain ; it has received its name fiom being perforated by numerous minute apertures for the trans- mission of small straight vessels into the substance of the corpus striatum. The optic commissure is situated in the middle line, immediately behind the lamina cinerea. It is the point of junction between the two optic nerves. 1 1 2

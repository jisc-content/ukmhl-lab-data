But the view which is nowniore generally adopted is that the cartilage-cells after becoming developed into these round clear bodies, are dissolved, and shed their granular contents to form the calcareous matrix, while the cells which line the primary areolae, and from which the future bone is developed, and which are on that account called ' osteoblasts,' are furnished by the blood-vessels which are to be found in those spaces. As these blood-vessels advance into the areolae, the latter break down, giving rise to the primary medullary canals, which are the rudiments of the Haversian canals. (Fig. XXIII.) The osteoblasts are believed to be cor- Eig.

The osteoblasts line the wall of the medullary space like an epithelium. They secrete the bony substance which separates the lacunae from each other. This appears first as a homogeneous opalescent material, in which bone salts are afterwards laid

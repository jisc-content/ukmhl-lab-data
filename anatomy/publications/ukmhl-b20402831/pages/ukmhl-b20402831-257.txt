HUMERUS. 91 formed by an extension into it of the centre of ossification which belongs to the spine, the extent of which varies in different cases. The two separate nuclei unite, and then join with the extension carried in from the spine. These various epiphyses become joined to the bone between the ages of twenty-two and twenty- five years. Sometimes failure of union between the acromion process and spine occurs, the junction being effected by fibrous tissue, or by an imperfect articulation; 86.â€”Plan of the Development of the Scapula. By Seven Centres. The epiphyses (except one for the Coracoid process) appear from fifteen to seventeen years, and unite between twenty-two and twenty-five years of age. in some cases of supposed fracture of the acromion with ligamentous union, it is probable that the detached segment was never united to the rest of the bone. Articulations. With the humerus and clavicle. Attachment of Muscles. To the anterior surface, the Subscapularis; posterior surface, Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus; spine, Trapezius, Deltoid; superior border, Omo-hyoid; vertebral border, Serratus magnus, Levator anguli scapulae, Rhom- boideus, minor and major; axillary border, Triceps, Teres minor, Teres major, glenoid cavity, long head of the Biceps; coracoid process, short head of the Biceps, Coraco-brachialis, Pectoralis minor; acromion process, the Platysma; and to the inferior angle occasionally a few fibres of the Latissimus dorsi. The Humerus. The Humerus is the longest and largest bone of the upper extremity; it presents for examination a shaft and two extremities. The Upper Extremity is the largest part of the bone ; it presents a rounded head, joined to the shaft by a constricted part, called the neck, and two other eminences, the greater and lesser tuberosities (fig. 87).

cii GENEEAL ANATOMY. lymphoid corpuscles, though in less quantity than in the nodules and rods of the gland-pulp. The afferent lymphatics open directly into the sustentacular tissue around the nodes and rods—the lymph-path or lymph-channel. This investing space is continuous over both the nodules of the cortical, and the rods or tubes of the medullary, portion, and the efferent lymphatics are continuous with it in the latter portion of the gland. The rods of the medullary part are described by Frey as forming a lymphoid sheath for the capillary vessels which run in the axis of the retiform tissue, while other branches are distributed in a rich network over it (fig. LXL). It is doubtless in these spaces that the exchange of materials goes on between the blood-vessels and the lymphatics which is necessary to the further elaboration of the lymph and the multiplication of the lymph-corpuscles which takes place in the glands (see p. xliii). THE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES. The Skin is the principal seat of the sense of touch, and may be regarded as a covering for the protection of the deeper tissues ; it is also Fig. LXII.—A Sectional View of the Skin (magnified). an important excretory and absorbing organ. It consists of two layers, the derma or cutis vera, and the epidermis or cuticle. On the surface of

This ligament supplies the place of the ligamenta subflava, and is in relation, behind, with the Inferior oblique muscles. 118.— Occipito-Atloid and Atlo-Axoid Ligaments. Posterior View. The Transverse Ligament* (figs. 119, 120) is a thick and strong ligamentous band, which arches across the ring of the atlas, and serves to retain the odontoid process in firm connection with its anterior arch. This ligament is flattened from 119. —Articulation between Odontoid Process and Atlas. before backwards, broader and thicker in the middle than at either extremity, and firmly attached on each side of the atlas to a small tubercle on the inner surface * It has been found necessary to describe the tranverse ligament with those of the atlas and axis ; but the student must remember that it is really a portion of the mechanism by which the movements of the head on the spine are regulated ; so that the connections between the atlas and axis ought always to be studied together with those between the latter bones and the skull.

ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 622 part of the submaxillary gland ; and internally, with the Genio-hyo-glossus, from which it is separated by the .lingual nerve and Wharton's duct. Its excretory ducts (ductus .Riviniani), from eight to twenty in number, open separately into the mouth, on the elevated crest of mucous membrane, caused by the projection of the gland, on either side of the frsenum linguse. One or more join to form a tube which opens into the Whartonian duct; this is called the duct of Bartholine. Vessels and Nerves. The sublingual gland is supplied with blood from the sublin- gual and submental arteries. Its nerves are derived from the gustatory. Structure. The salivary are conglomerate glands, consisting of numerous lobes, which are made up of smaller lobules, connected together by dense areolar tissue, 341.—A highly magnified Section of the Submaxillary Gland of the Dog, stained with Carmine.

Each lobule consists of the ramifications of a single duct,' branching frequently in a tree-like manner,' the branches terminating in dilated ends or alveoli on which the capillaries are distributed. These alveoli, however, as Pfltiger points out, are not necessarily spherical, though sometimes they assume that form, sometimes they are 342.—Illustrating Pfliiger's Views of the Termination of the Nerves in the Alveolar Cells.

THE EECTUM. 645 directions. The rectum is, therefore, not straight, the upper part being directed obliquely from the left side to the median line, the middle portion being curved in the direction of the hollow of the sacrum and coccyx, and the lower portion pre- senting a short curve in the opposite direction. The rectum is cylindrical, not sac- culated like the rest of the large intestine ; it is narrower at its upper part than the sigmoid flexure, gradually increases in size as it descends, and immediately above the anus presents a considerable dilatation, capable of acquiring an enormous size. The rectum is divided into three portions : upper, middle, and lower. The upper portion, which includes about half the length of the tube, extends obliquely from the left sacro-iliac symphysis to the middle of the third piece of the 360.â€”The relations of the Viscera and Large Vessels of the Abdomen. (Seen from behind.) sacrum. It is almost completely surrounded by peritoneum, and connected to the sacrum behind by a duplicative of that membrane, the meso-rectum. It is in relation behind with the Pyriformis muscle, the sacral plexus of nerves, and the branches of the internal iliac artery of the left side, which separate it from the sacrum and sacro- iliac symphysis; in front it is separated, in the male, from the posterior surface of the bladder; in the female, from the posterior surface of the uterus, and its append- ages, by some convolutions of the small intestine. The middle portion of the rectum is about three inches in length, and extends as far as the tip of the coccyx. It is closely connected to the concavity of the sacrum, and covered by peritoneum only on the upper part of its anterior surface. It is in relation, in front in the male, with the triangular portion of the base of the bladder,

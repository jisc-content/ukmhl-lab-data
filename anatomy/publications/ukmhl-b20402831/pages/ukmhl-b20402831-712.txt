546 SPINAL NERVES. nerve gives a descending filament to the fourth, and divides into two branches which assist in forming the anterior crural and obturator nerves; sometimes, also, it furnishes a part of the accessory obturator. The fourth nerve completes the formation of the anterior crural, and the obturator, and gives off a communi- cating branch to the fifth lumbar; sometimes it also furnishes part of the accessory obturator. The branches of the lumbar plexus are the Ilio-hypogastric. Obturator. Ilio-inguinal. Accessory obturator. Genito-crural. Anterior crural. External cutaneous. These branches may be divided into two groups, according to their mode of dis- tribution. One group, including the ilio-hypogastric, ilio-inguinal, and part of the genito-crural nerves, supplies the lower part of the parietes of the abdomen; the 294.â€”The Lumbar Plexus and its Branches. other group, which includes the remaining nerves, supplies the fore part of the thigh and inner side of the leg. The Ilio-hypogastric Nerve (superior musculo-cutaneous) arises from the first lumbar nerve. It pierces the outer border of the Psoas muscle at its upper part, and crosses obliquely in front of the Quadratus lumborum to the crest of the ilium. It then perforates the Transversalis muscle at its back part, and divides between it and the Internal oblique into two branches, iliac and hypogastric.

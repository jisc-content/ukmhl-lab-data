The Phalanges are developed by two centres for each bone : one for the shaft, and one for the metatarsal extremity. Sesamoid Bones. These are small rounded masses, cartilaginous in early life, osseous in the adult, which are developed in those tendons which exert a great amount of pressure upon the parts over which they glide.

They are invested throughout their whole surface by the fibrous tissue of the tendon in which they are found, excepting upon that side which lies in contact with the part over which they play, where they present a free articular facet. They may be divided into two kinds : those which glide over the articular surfaces of joints, and those which play over the cartila- ginous facets found on the surfaces of certain bones. The sesamoid bones of the joints are, in the lower extremity, the patella, which is developed in the tendon of the Quadriceps extensor; two small sesamoid bones, found in the tendons of the Flexor brevis pollicis, opposite the metatarso- phalangeal joint of the great toe, and occasionally one in the metatarso-phalangeal

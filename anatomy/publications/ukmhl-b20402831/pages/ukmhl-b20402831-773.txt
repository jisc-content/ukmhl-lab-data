607 THE MEMBRANOUS LABYRINTH. on the inner surface of the wall of each cavity, becoming blended with a layer of nucleated cells, and terminating in a thin fibrous film. The cochlear nerve divides into numerous filaments at the base of the modiolus, which ascend along its canals, and then, bending outwards at right angles, pass between the plates of the bony lamina spiralis, close to its tympanic surface. Between the plates of the spiral lamina, the nerves form a plexus, which contains ganglion-cells ; and from the margin of the osseous zone, branches of this plexus are distributed to the membranous part of the septum, where they are arranged in small, conical-shaped bundles, parallel with one another. The filaments which supply the apical portion of the lamina spiralis are conducted to this part through the tubulus centralis modioli.

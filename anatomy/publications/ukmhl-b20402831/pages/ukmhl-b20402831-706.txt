The articular filaments to the wrist are also supplied by the ulnar nerve. The superficial palmar branch supplies the Palmaris brevis, and the integument on the inner side of the 292.â€”The Suprascapular, Circumflex, and Musculo-Spiral Nerves.

The deep palmar branch passes between the Ab- ductor and Flexor brevis minimi digiti muscles, and follows the course of the deep palmar arch beneath the flexor tendons. At its origin, it supplies the muscles of the little finger. As it crosses the deep part of the hand, it sends two branches to each interos- seous space, one for the Dorsal and one for the Palmar interosseous mus- cle, the branches to the second and third Palmar interossei supplying fila- ments to the two inner Lumbricales muscles. At its termination between the thumb and index finger, it supplies the Adductor pol- licis and the inner head of the Flexor brevis pollicis. The Musculo-Spiral Nerve (fig. 292), the larg- est branch of the brachial plexus, supplies the mus- cles of the back part of the arm and fore-arm, and the integument of the same parts, as well as that of the hand. It arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus by a com- mon trunk with the cir- cumflex nerve. At its commencement it is placed behind the axillary and upper part of the brachial arteries, passing down in front of the tendons of the Latissimus dorsi and Teres major. It winds round the humerus in the spiral groove with the superior profunda artery, passing from the inner to the outer side of the bone, beneath the Triceps muscle.

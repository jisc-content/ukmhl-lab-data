They are of three kinds : — 1. Hsematin crystals, found in normal Fig. IV.—Blood-crystals. A, trihedral crystals from blood of guinea-pig. B; pentagonal crystals from blood of squirrel. 0, octahedral crystals from blood of rat and mouse. D, hsematin crystals from human blood. E, hsematoidin crystals from an old apoplectic clot. F, hsemin crystals from blood treated with acetic acid. blood, particularly in the spleen. These are procured by the addition of a little water, or by agitating the blood with ether, by either of which means the blood-corpuscles are ruptured, and their contents crystallise on evapo- ration. 2. Hsematoidin crystals, found in old clots. 3. Hsemin crystals, formed by mixing dried blood with an equal quantity of common salt and boiling it with a few drops of glacial acetic acid till the whole has dissolved. A drop of the mixture placed on the slide will show the crystals on cooling. Fig. IV. shows these three forms of crystals from human blood, together with some from the lower animals, for comparison. The importance of being acquainted with the crystals found in human

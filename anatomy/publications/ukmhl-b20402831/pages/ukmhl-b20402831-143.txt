DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN. cyxxvii intestine, to form, along with, the corneous layer of the epiblast, a similar pouch, which becomes closed and converted into a closed glandular body, the Fig. LXXXVII.â€”Vertical section of the head in early embryos of the rabbit.

B, from an embryo of six millimetres long. 0, vertical section of the anterior end of the notochord and pituitary body, &c.,from an embryo sixteen millimetres long. In A, the faucial opening is still closed; in B, it is formed ; c, anterior cerebral vesicle ; mc, nieso-cerebrum ; mo, medulla oblongata; co, corneous layer; m, medullary layer; if, infundibulum; am, amnion ; spe, spheno-ethmoidal, be, central (dorsum sellse), and spo, spheno-occipital parts of the basis cranii; h, heart; ff anterior extremity of primitive alimentary canal and opening (later) of the fauces; i, cephalic portion of primitive intestine ; tha, thalamus ; p', closed opening of the involuted part of the pituitary body (py) ; ch, notochord; ph, pharynx. glandular part of the pituitary body, or hypophysis. The end of the noto- chord would lie at first between these two parts of the pituitary body ; but it is believed that, as the hypophysis becomes closed off and separated from the pharynx, the two parts of the pituitary body are carried back- wards and upwards from off the end of the notochord, so as to leave the latter stranded as it were below the pituitary fossa. Others refer the hypophysal part of the pituitary body to epiblastic elements derived from the buccal part of the epiblast only, and so connect its development, not with the pharynx, but Avith the mouth and the anterior portion of the skull. The question is an obscure one, but its main interest is to remind the reader that this peculiar appendage to the brain forms, in an early condition of the foetus, the meeting-point of the portions of the ovum from

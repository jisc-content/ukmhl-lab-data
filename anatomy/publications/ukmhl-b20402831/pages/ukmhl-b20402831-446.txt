28o MUSCLES AND FASCIAE. It arises from the external middle of the forearm in a the thumb. By its deep sur- 178. face, with the elbow-joint, the Extensor carpi radialis brevior, and back part of the wrist. The Extensor Carpi Ra- dialis Brevior is shorter, as its name implies, and thicker than the preceding muscle, beneath which it is placed. condyle of the humerus by a tendon common to it and the three following muscles; from the external lateral ligament of the elbow-joint; from a strong aponeurosis which covers its surface; and from the inter- muscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles. The fibres terminate about the flat tendon, which is closely connected with that of the pre- ceding muscle, accompanies it to the wrist lying in the same groove on the posterior surface of the radius ; passes beneath the annular ligament and, diverging somewhat from its fellow, is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger, on its radial side. The tendons of the two pre- ceding muscles pass through the same compartment of the annular ligament, and are lubricated by a single syno- vial membrane, but are sepa- rated from each other by a small vertical ridge of bone as they lie in the groove at the back of the radius. Relations. By its super- ficial surface, with the Ex- tensor carpi radialis longior, and with the Extensor muscles of the thumb, which cross it. By its deep surface, with the Supinator brevis, tendon of the Pronator radii teres, radius, and wrist-joint. By its idnar border, with the Extensor communis digito- rum. â€¢Posterior Surface of Forearm. Superficial Muscles.

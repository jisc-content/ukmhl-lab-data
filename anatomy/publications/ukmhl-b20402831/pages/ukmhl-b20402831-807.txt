PEYER'S GLANDS. 641 on them, are generally absent from the very summit (or 'cupola,' as Frey calls it) of the follicle. Peyer's glands (figs. 355-357) may be regarded as aggregations of solitary glands, forming circular or oval patches from twenty to thirty in number, and varying in 355.—Patch of Peyer's Glands. 356.—A portion of the above magnified.

In the lower part of the jejunum they are small, of a circular form, and few in number. They are occasionally seen in the duodenum. They are placed lengthwise in the intestine, covering the portion of the tube most distant from the attachment of the mesentery. Each patch is formed of a group of the above- described lymphoid follicles covered with mucous membrane. Each is surrounded by a zone, or wreath of simple follicles, and the interspaces between them are covered with villi. The mucous and submucous coats of the intestine are intimately T T

GENERAL ANATOMY. cxxviii omphalomesenteric arteries and veins, and the duct of the umbilical vesicle, all of which are originally contained in the rudimentary cord. Fig. LXXVIII.—Sectional plan of the gravid uterus, from Wagner, in the third and fourth mouth, a, plug of mucus in the neck of the uterus, b, Fallopian tube, c, the decidua vera ; c2, the decidua vera passing into the right Fallopian tube: the cavity of the uterus is almost completely occupied by the ovum; e e, points of the reflection of the decidua refiexa (in nature the united deciduse do not stop here, but pass over the whole uterine surface of the placenta); g, supposed allantois; h, umbilical vesicle; i, amnion; k, chorion, covered with the decidua refiexa ; d, cavity of the decidua; /, decidua serotina, or placental decidua. The permanent structures of the cord are therefore those furnished by the allantois. Growth of the embryo.—The youngest human embryos which have been met with are two described by Dr. A. Thomson in the 6 Edin. Med. and Surg. Journal,' 1839, anc^ i*1 n^s paper references to the other extant de- scriptions of early ova will be found. The ova in question were believed to be of the ages respectively of twelve to fourteen days, and about fifteen days.* The figures are here reproduced. The earliest ovum (fig. LXXIX.) was 4^-th of an inch in diameter, when freed from some adherent decidua. The chorion presented a slightly villous appearance, and consisted or.ly of one layer of membrane. On opening it the umbilical vesicle and embryo were found not to fill its cavity completely. The embryo was a line in length, and nearly ^th of an inch in thickness. The chorion was united to the embryo and umbilical vesicle by a thin tenacious web of albuminous filaments, * For the data on which these calculations are founded, the reader is referred to the original paper.

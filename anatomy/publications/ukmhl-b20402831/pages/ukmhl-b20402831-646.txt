Gnat Longitudinal KlSSUre. The convolutions seen on the outer side of the frontal lobe are described as an ascending or transverse frontal convolution, which lies parallel to and in front of the fissure of Rolando, and three more or less horizontal convolutions, the superior, middle, and inferior frontal (fig. 265). The external surface of the parietal lobe is formed in front by a convolution lying parallel to and behind the fissure of Rolando, named the ascending parietal, which usually joins the ascending frontal either above or below. Its central and lower part is bounded behind by the inter-parietal fissure, a fissure which commences below in or near the fissure of Sylvius, and runs upwards to the vertex, where it terminates in or near the parieto-occipital fissure. The group of convolutions connected with the upper part of the ascending parietal, and lying in front of the inter-parietal fissure, are called the superior parietal lobule. Lower down, and lying behind the inter-parietal fissure, is the lower parietal lobule, divided into the supra- marginal and the angular convolution, which run into each other above and below. The augular convolution is continuous with the convolutions of the temporo-sphenoidal and occipital lobes. The occipital lobe is chiefly formed by three somewhat parallel convolutions, the superior, middle, and inferior, separated by two fissures, the superior and in- * In the specimen from which this figure was drawn, the parieto-occipital fissure has been bridged over, or obliterated, by one of the annectant convolutions of the occipital lobe, but its continuation can be traced on the internal aspect of the hemisphere.

GENERAL ANATOMY. lxxx but smaller, average diameter than those of the columns ; 2. nerve-cells of various shapes and sizes, with from two to eight processes ; 3. blood- vessels and connective tissue. Each lateral half of the grey substance is divided into an anterior and a posterior horn, and the tractus intermedio-lateralis, or lateral part of the grey substance between the anterior and posterior cornua. The posterior horn consists of two parts—the caput cornu, or expanded extremity of the horn (fig. XLIL), round which is the lighter space or lamina, the gelatinous sub- Fig. XLII.—Transverse section of the grey sub- stance of the spinal cord, near the middle of the dorsal region.

The gelatinous substance contains along its border a series of large nerve-cells ; but more internally consists of a stratum of small cells traversed by trans- verse, oblique, and longitudinal fibres. (Figs. XLIIL, XLIY.) Nearly the whole inner half of the cervix is occupied by a re- markable and important column of nerve-cells, called the poste- rior vesicular column (fig.

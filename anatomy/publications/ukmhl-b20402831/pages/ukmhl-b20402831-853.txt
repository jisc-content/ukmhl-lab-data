687 VESSELS OF THE LARYNX. where it is thin, and very intimately adherent; covers the inner surface of tbc crico-thyroid membrane and cricoid cartilage; and is ultimately continuous with the lining membrane of the trachea. It is covered with columnar ciliated epithelium, below the superior vocal cord; but, above this point, the cilia are found only in front, as high as the middle of the epiglottis. In the rest of its extent, the epithe- lium is of the squamous variety. Glands.—The mucous membrane of the larynx is furnished with numerous muciparous glands, the orifices of which are found in nearly every part; they are very numerous upon the epiglottis, being lodged in little pits in its substance ; they are also found in large numbers along the posterior margin of the aryteno-epiglotti- dean fold, in front of the arytenoid cartilages, where they are termed the arytenoid (/lands. They exist also in large numbers upon the inner surface of the sacculus laryngis. 1ST one are found on the vocal cords. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the larynx are the laryngeal branches derived from the superior and inferior thyroid. The veins empty themselves into 387.—Front View of Cartilages of Larynx: the Trachea and Bronchi. the superior middle and inferior thyroid veins. The lymphatics terminate in the deep cervical glands. The nerves are the superior laryngeal, and the inferior or

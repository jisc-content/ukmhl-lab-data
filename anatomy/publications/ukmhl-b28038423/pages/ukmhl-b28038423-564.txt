ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. 448 The nucleus is in the phase of the equatorial plate, in which the original threads are compressed into a thin stratum, seen here in profile. From this equatorial plate fine threads apparently radiate towards two opposite poles, thus forming what is called the nuclear spindle. From the poles of the spindle numbers of fine fibrils are seen radiating; they belong to the intracellular network. /.'From a similar preparation of Dr. Mayzel, representing a further stage than in the previous figure. The threads of the former equatorial plate have moved from the equator towards the poles ; they now form a Dyaster, in which the two stars are sepa- rated from one another. If viewed from the surface, the radiating arrangement of the loops would be as well seen as in. k. In the dividing nuclei of the epithelium of the bladder of the newt nothing is seen that would correspond to the spindle of o and p. In p the cell itself has commenced to divide. y, r, and s are obtained from the epithelium of the bladder of the common frog, showing the stars of the Dyaster separated partially (y, r) or wholly (s). In s the spindle is well shown, and the loops of the upper aster have already reached the upper pole; those of the lower aster are near, but not quite at the lower pole. The cell is on the point of dividing; so is also the spindle itself. t. A similar dividing cell and nucleus of the deep layer of the stratum Malpighii of the skin of the sheep. The identity in the appearance is very striking, but the nucleus is much smaller. LONDON : PRINTED BY SPOTTISWOODE AND CO., NEW-STREET SQUARE AND PARLIAMENT STREET

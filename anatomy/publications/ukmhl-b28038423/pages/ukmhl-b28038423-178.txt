ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. u8 CHAPTER XVII. THE SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM. A. The Sympathetic Nerve Fibres. The sympathetic nerve trunks resemble those of the cerebro-spinal system ; they contain medullated and non-medullated nerve fibres. Unlike the cerebro-spinal system, the former are in some parts less numerous than the latter. The medullated nerve fibres of the sympathetic vary in breadth ; they decrease in number towards the periphery. As regards structure, they in no way differ from the medullated nerve fibres of the cerebro-spinal nerves, viz. they possess : (a) an axis cylinder finely striated, being composed of fine fibrils, elementary nerve fibrils; (6) a medullary sheath ; (c) a hyaline sheath of Schwann ; and on the inside of this (I) nucleated nerve corpuscles. They show also Ranvier’s nodes. The medullated nerve fibres of medium size, and also the fine ones, show occasionally more or less regular varicosities. The non-medullated nerve fibres, or Remak’s fibres, are pale, finely fibrillar axis cylinders, many of them invested in a hyaline sheath of Schwann with nerve corpuscles (Remak, Max Schultze, Waldeyer) ; that is to say, they completely resemble the non- medullated nerve fibres of the cerebro-spinal nerves described in a former chapter. They branch very often into two or three fine fibres. There are, however, some fine axis cylinders which do not appear to possess any sheath of Schwann, but only a few nerve corpuscles. They are to be met with in numbers at the peripheral distribution of the sympathetic nerves. The number of non-medullated nerve fibres is always considerable in the trunks and increases towards the periphery, so that the peripheral nerve branches possess many more non-medullated than medullated fibres. The microscopic branches, bundles, of the sympathetic system are invested in a thin perineurium, which in the small examples is merely an endothelial membrane; in the larger ones it contains also a small amount of fibrous-connective tissue.

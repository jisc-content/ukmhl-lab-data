264 ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. In connection with the plexus of non-medullated nerve fibres of the serous and subserous connective tissue are numerous smaller and larger ganglia (Fr. Darwin); some of the nerve branches connected with them have an intimate relation to the large blood-vessels of these parts. In connection with the nerve branches of the muscular coat are also groups of ganglion cells ; they have been figured in Plate XXIII. and described on p. 120. According to Kisselew the nerve fibres of the mucosa terminate in special cells situated amongst the epithelial cells of the inner surface. PLATE XXXVIIa. Fig. I. is a diagram showing the course of the renal tubules and their variations in the different sections of the cortex and medulla. a. Cortex limited on its free surface by the capsule. a. Subscapsular layer not containing Malpighian corpuscles. ax. Inner stratum of cortex without Malpighian corpuscles. b. Boundary layer. c. Papillary part next the boundary layer. 1. Bowman’s capsule of the Malpighian corpuscle. 2. Its neck. 3. Proximal convoluted tubule. 4. Spiral tubule of Schachowa. 5. Descending limb of Henle’s loop. 6. The loop proper. 7. Thick part of the ascending limb. 8. Spiral part of the same. 9. The narrow ascending limb in the medullary ray. 10. The irregular tubule. 11. The intercalated section of Schweigger-Seidel, or the distal convoluted tubule. 12. The curved collecting tubule. 13. The straight collecting tubule of the medullary ray. 14. The collecting tube of the boundary layer. 15. The large collecting tube of the papillary part. In the papilla itself, not represented here, this tube becomes confluent with others and thus forms : 16. The duct.

ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. CHAPTER I. BLOOD, Blood of vertebrate animals contains suspended in a colourless plasma two kinds of corpuscular elements : (a) coloured or so-called red ; and (<5) colourless or so-called white corpuscles. One hundred volumes of blood of man contain about sixty-four volumes of plasma and thirty-six volumes of corpuscles. According to recent measurements (Hayem, Mallassez), there are 4^5 to 5*5 millions of coloured blood-corpuscles in one cubic millimetre (or 2\ cubic inch) of human blood. In seme animals it is much greater, even as great as eighteen mill, (camels, &c.). The number varies greatly in different vertebrate animals. In birds it is smaller than in mammals, and in fishes it is smallest. The relation between colourless and coloured corpuscles in normal human blood varies from 1 for 1,250 to 1 for 650. There is no constant increase in the number of colourless corpuscles after meals. The number of colourless corpuscles after a meal and simultaneous drinking is increased, but seems to be decreased after a meal without drinking. The size of coloured corpuscles varies in different vertebrate animals. The largest are possessed by amphibian animals (proteus, amphiuma), the smallest by mammals : Moschus javanicus, Meminna and musk-deer, have the smallest blood corpuscles. [In Rollett’s article on Blood in ‘Strieker’s Handbook ’ will be found a table, by Welker, of measurements of blood-corpuscles of the different classes of vertebrate animals. See also Gulliver, in ‘Proceed. Zoolog. Society of London,’ 1874 and 1875.] i. Colourless Blood-Corpuscles. The colourless blood-corpuscles are spherical, pale, and transparent, when observed in the circulating or perfectly fresh blood. In most instances they are larger than the coloured corpuscles, but there are in every blood some that are smaller. They possess B

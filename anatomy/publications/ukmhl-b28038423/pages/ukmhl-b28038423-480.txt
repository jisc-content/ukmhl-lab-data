378 ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. Fig. VIII. Surface view of part of the outer root-sheath of a cilium of a newborn child, to show the branched cells between the epithelial cells of the outer root-sheath. Magnifying power about 300. Fig. IX. Longitudinal section through a papillary hair of the adult human scalp. Magnifying power about 60. 1. Epidermis of the general surface; only its stratum Malpighii is here indicated. 2. The mouth of the hair-follicle. 3. The alveoli of the sebaceous gland. 4. The bundles of the arrector pili. 5. The papilla. 6. Adipose tissue. PLATE XLII. Fig. X. Transverse section through two hairs of the paw of a foetal kitten. Magnifying power about 300. A is a section through a thicker hair and is further away from the hair-papilla than B. 1. The cells of the substance of the hair. 2. The cuticle of the hair. 3. The cuticle of the inner root-sheath. 4. The inner or Huxley’s layer. 5. The outer or Henle’s layer. 6. The cells of the outer root-sheath, indicated by their nuclei. 7. The circular layer of the hair-sac. 8. Lymph-space. 9. The surrounding connective tissue. Fig. XI. Longitudinal section through the hair of the lip of a foetal rabbit. Magnifying power about 300. 1. The hair-papilla is indicated by the nuclei of its cells ; a few branched cells are seen amongst them, similar ones are also extending between the cells of the hair bulb. 2. The hair-bulb, its cells indicated by their nuclei. 3. The marginal layer of cells of the outer root-sheath at the bulb.

ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. 226 hunger the outline of the gland tubes is quite smooth, while during digestion it be- comes irregular, being notched-in, corresponding to the outlines of the lining epithelial cells. This condition can be easily confirmed in hardened specimens. They also noticed that the striation of the outer zone of the cells is more distinct during digestion. The cells are separated from one another by a thin layer of a homogeneous interstitial substance, which corresponds to the ultimate or capillary secreting canals (Latchenberger and others; see the reference to the various assertions as regards the pancreas and salivary glands in Chapter XXIII.). The centre of the alveoli is occupied by the same interstitial substance, there being visible, as a rule, no distinct lumen or only a trace of such an one. In all parts of the gland tubes the place of the lumen is occupied by spindle-shaped or branched cells, each with an oval nucleus, the centroacinar cells of Langerhans. It is difficult to definitely ascertain whether these centroacinar cells are continuations of the cells of the inter- mediary parts of the ducts (Langerhans, Teraszkievicz) or not; if the former be the case, the epithelial cells lining the alveoli would be altogether independent of those lining the intermediary part, and the latter would, then, be continuous with the alveoli only by means of the membrana propria and the centroacinar cells.

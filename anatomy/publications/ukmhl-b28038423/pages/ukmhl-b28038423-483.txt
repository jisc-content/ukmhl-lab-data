STRUCTURE OF THE HAIR. 379 4 and 5. The cells from which the inner root sheath is formed. 6. The layer of transversely arranged spindle-shaped cells, which have been referred to in the text as resembling unstriped muscle cells. 7. The outer root-sheath. 8. The rudiment of the inner root-sheath. 9. The hair substance. Fig. XII. From a longitudinal section through a cilium of a newborn child. Magnifying power about 400. 1. The hair substance, rows of pigment granules in it ; the marrow is indicated as a clear central part with a few (large) groups of air-bubbles. 2. The cuticle of the hair. 3. The inner root-sheath, its constituent parts not differentiated here. 4. The cell-layers constituting the outer root-sheath. 5. The glassy membrane. # 6. Intraepithelial connective-tissue cells. Fig. XIII. A sebaceous gland from a vertical section through the lip of mouth of the sheep. Magnifying power about 200. 1. The duct. 2. The branches of it. 3. The alveoli. The minute details of structure of the cells of the alveoli are not indicated here The distinction between the nucleated cells filling the alveoli themselves and their remnants in the branches of the duct is here too sharp. Fig. XIV. From a section through a lobule of foetal subcutaneous fat-tissue. Magnifying power about 450. 1. Fart of the connective-tissue septum between two fat-lobules. 2. Lymph-space. 3. A capillary blood-vessel. 4. Fat-cells in various stages of formation, filled with oil globules, dissolved out in the preparation from which this drawing is obtained. Some of the cells are distinctly possessed of processes. Fig. XV. Transverse section through the hair of eai lobe of the pig. Magnifying power about 350. 3 1

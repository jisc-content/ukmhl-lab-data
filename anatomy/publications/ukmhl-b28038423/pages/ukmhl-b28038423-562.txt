446 ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. 3. The cell streaks of the zona fasciculata. 4. The inner zone of the cortex. 5. Cell streaks similar to those of the zona fasciculata, but shorter, and grouped as lobules. 6. Medulla with large capillary veins. Fig. V. From a section through the zona fasciculata of the suprarenal body of the dog. Magnifying power about 350. 1. Capillary blood-vessels. 2. The streaks composed of polyhedral epithelial cells. The intercellular lymph spaces are well shown at 3. Fig. VI. From a transverse section through the outer part of the cortex of the suprarenal body of a new-born child. Magnifying power about 300. 1. The outer capsule. 2. A minute vein. 3. Capillary blood-vessel. 4. Homogeneous gelatinous material contained in a lymph space between the cell groups. 5. 6. The same material contained in a space within the cell groups. The two spaces in which they lie appear as if belonging to a canal twice cut; the limiting small polyhedral cell would in this case form in reality a tubular structure, whose cavity is shown at 5 and 6. 7. The same material contained in a space which looks like the lumen of a tubular alveolus cut transversely. 8. The polyhedral cells of the zona fasciculata. The remainder of this Plate illustrates the process of indirect division, or the Karyokinesis (Flemming). All figures have been drawn with Zeiss’s ^ °il immersion. a. A nucleus of the superficial layer of the epithelium lining the mucous membrane of the urinary bladder of the newt. The nucleus contains numerous fine fibrils in convolution, and connected as a reticulum. Several large looplike or irregularly shaped thickenings, nucleoli. b. An epithelial cell of the deep layer. The intracellular fibrils are very distinct; like those in the nucleus with which they are directly continuous, they are much convoluted and also connected in a network.

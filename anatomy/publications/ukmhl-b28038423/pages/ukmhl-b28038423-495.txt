LAYERS OF THE RETINA. 387 6. A few of the inner nuclei. The spindle-shaped cells of which they form part have been omitted. Fig. XXVI. Two radial Muller’s fibres of the retina of the rabbit. Magnifying power about 400. 1. The layer of the outer nuclei. 2. The layer of the inner nuclei. The oval nuclei here shown belong to the radial fibres. 3. The connection of the radial fibres with the matrix of the inner granular layer. 4. The region of the ganglion cells. Here the radial fibres overlap each other in the preparation, and appear therefore in the drawing as if they formed a single fibre. The inner extremity of the fibres is not shown. Fig. XXVII. From a vertical section through the retina of the rabbit. Magnify- ing power about 400. 1. The region of the outer nuclei. 2. The outer granular layer. 3. The inner nuclei. 4. The nucleus of a connective-tissue corpuscle. 5. The inner granular layer. Its reticular matrix is well shown. 6. The inner extremities of the radial or Muller’s fibres. 7. The limitans interna formed by the inner free surface of the radial fibres. Fig. XXVIII. A ganglion cell from the same retina as that represented in fig. XXIII. Magnifying power about 660. 1. The outer processes of the ganglion cell terminate apparently in the reticulum of the inner granular layer. 2. The body of the ganglion cell. 3. Nerve fibres. Fig. XXIX. Two ganglion cells of the same retina as in the preceding figure. 1. Inner granular layer. 2. The ganglion cells. 3. A blood-vessel in transverse section. 3 K

LYMPH-SPACES OF GANGLIA117 the brain (Stannius, Langerhans) : both become invested in a hyaline sheath of Schwann, which is a continuation of the capsule of the ganglion cell; but they remain without a medullary sheath and represent therefore non-medullated nerve fibres. The capsule of the ganglion cell is a hyaline delicate membrane, lined with a special layer of nucleated cells, just as in the spinal ganglia of higher animals. Key and Retzius injected from the subdural and subarachnoidal spaces of the cord the corresponding spaces of the nerve roots and of the ganglia. The lamellar septa of the ganglia, viz. those continuous with the perineurium of the nerve bundles, contain also lymph spaces which, on the one hand, are connected with the subarachnoidal spaces of the ganglion, and, on the other, pass into the very dense network of channels and spaces in the endoneural ganglionic connective tissue. The ganglion cells, just like the nerve fibres of the cerebro-spinal nerves mentioned in Chapter XII., are surrounded by these channels and spaces.

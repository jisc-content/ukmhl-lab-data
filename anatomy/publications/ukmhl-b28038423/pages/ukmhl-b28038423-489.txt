383 MEMBRANES OF THE EYE. 2. A second corneal corpuscle simply crossed by nerve fibrils. On the right the nerve fibril does not actually terminate in the substance of the corpuscle; it is in reality above the corpuscle. Fig. VII. From a meridional section through the eye of the ox. Magnifying power about 30. 1. Cornea. 2. Conjunctiva, at the limbus containing diffuse adenoid tissue. 3. Sclerotic ; the connective-tissue corpuscles contain much pigment. 4. Root of iris. 5. Ciliary muscle ; only its meridional portion is here shown. 6. Ciliary process. Fig. VIII. From a meridional section through the eye of a child. Magnifying power about 40. 1. Cornea. 2. Sclerotic. 3. Iris. 4. Ciliary process. 5. Ligamentum pectinatum. 6. Meridional portion of the ciliary muscle, its bundles forming plexuses. The radiating portion is shown as minute dots—because transversely cut—between the meridional portion and the ciliary process. 7. Chorioidea. 8. Retina of the ora serrata. 9. Sphincter pupillae. Fig. IX. From a meridional section through the eye of a sheep. Magnifying power about 30. 1. Cornea. 2. Conjunctiva of the limbus. 3. Sclerotic. 4. Iris ; the pigment of its tissue and of its anterior epithelium has been omitted. 5. Ciliary process. Numerous folds are seen on the posterior surface of this as well as of the iris.

From a transverse section through the cervical region of spinal cord of calf, showing six ganglion cells of the lateral group of the anterior horn extending between the nerve fibres of the white matter. Magnifying power about 350. G. Fibres of the grey matter passing into the lateral tracts. g, Ganglion cells. w, Medullated nerve fibres of the white matter in transverse section. The large nerve fibres with large axis cylinder are probably derived from the gan- glion cells, viz. axis-cylinder processes that have become invested in a medullary sheath. The ganglion cells extending chiefly in a longitudinal direction appear, in a trans- verse section, cut obliquely or transversely.

417 STRUCTURE OF COCHLEA. 7. Membrana basilaris. 8. Reissner’s membrane. 9. Sulcus spiralis interims. Over it passes the Membrana tectoria of Corti. 10. The tunnel of Corti’s arch. 11. Stria vascularis. 12. Ligamentum spirale. 13. Crista spiralis. 14. Nerve fibres in the lamina spiralis ossea. 15. Ganglion spirale. 16. Part of the cochlear nerve in the modiolus. 17. Channels in the bone, containing blood-vessels and lymphatics. 18. Osseous lamellae of the modiolus. 19. Bony capsule ; the details of its structure are not represented. 20. Cupola. Fig. II. From a longitudinal section through the cochlea of the guinea-pig, show- ing the cochlear canal of the second turn. Magnifying power about 150. 1—15. The same as in fig. I. 16. The vestibular lamella of the lamina spiralis ossea. 17. Bony capsule. Fig. III. From a longitudinal section through the cochlea of the guinea-pig, the same as in fig. I. ; showing the organ of Corti and the adjacent parts. Magnifying power about 300. 1. The outer pillar of Corti’s arch. 2. The inner pillar. The foot, body, head, and head-plate and the nucleated protoplasm at the foot are well shown. The latter stretches across the floor of the tunnel. 4. The cells of Corti of the outer hair-cells and the spindle-shaped cells of Deiters are well shown. The cilia of the hair-cells project through the lamina reticularis shown in profile on the surface of the organ of Corti. 5. The inner hair-cell ; underneath it the ‘granular’ cells of Waldeyer. 6. The outer supporting cells of Hensen ; most of them contain fat-globuies stained black by the osmic acid. 7. The inner supporting cells.

193 NERVES OF SALIVARY GLANDS. represented by smaller or larger chains of ganglion cells within a nerve branch. Their structure has been described and figured in a former chapter (see figure II. Plate XXII.). Most of these ganglion cells are unipolar, and ensheathed in a special capsule. According to Pflliger, the nerve fibres coming off from this plexus remain medullated until their termination is reached, viz. just before they enter the intralobular ducts (Pflliger’s salivary tubes) and alveoli. Then each nerve fibre loses its medullary sheath, and its axis- cylinder, composed of minute fibrils, becomes directly connected with the cell substance of the epithelium of those ducts. The nerve fibres for the alveoli remain medullated until the membrana propria is reached, they are also in direct continuity with the lining cells. Thus all the epithelial cells are real terminations of nerve fibres; and during regeneration they are direct outgrowths of the nervous elements. Pflliger also mentions isolated multipolar ganglion cells (Krause) between alveoli, by their intervention a connection is occasionally established between nerve fibres and epithelial cells. These assertions of Pflliger have received a certain amount of support in the observa- tions of Kupffer on the termination of nerves in the salivary gland of periplaneta orien- tal^. Kupffer saw here a plexus of fine nerve fibres surrounding the alveoli of the gland ; from it pass minute fibres which enter the epithelial cells themselves, in whose reticular substance they terminate. But, on the other hand, with regard to the nerve distribution in the salivary glands of man and the other mammals, the correctness of Pflliger’s assertions has been questioned or altogether denied by all who have investigated this subject.

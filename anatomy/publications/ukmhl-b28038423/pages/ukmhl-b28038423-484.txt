38° ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. 1. The pigmented substance of the hair. 2. The cuticle of the hair. 3. Huxley’s layer of the inner root-sheath. 4. Henle’s layer of it. Many of the cells of both contain a remnant of a nucleus. 5. The cell-layers of the outer root-sheath. 6. The marginal layer of columnar cells with oval nuclei. Fig. XVI. Transverse section through the hair and hair-follicle of the adult human scalp. Magnifying power about 350. 1. The marrow. 2. The pigmented substance of the hair. 3. The cuticle of the hair ; next to this is a delicate line, indicating the cuticle of the inner root-sheath. 4. Huxley’s layer. 5. Henle’s layer of the inner root-sheath. 6. The outer root-sheath. 7. The glassy membrane ; next to this is the circular coat of the hair-sac. 8. A lymph-space between the circular coat of the hair-sac and the connective tissue forming its outer coat. Fig. XVII. Vertical section through the eyelid of a newborn child. Magni- fying power about 25. 1. The conjunctiva palpebrse; its epithelium is indicated as a purple line. The mucosa is represented much too thick. 2. The mouth of the duct of a Meibomian gland. 3. The cilia. 4. The skin of the lid; sweat glands and hairs are only faintly indicated as prolon- gations of the stratum Malpighii. 5. The bundles of the sphincter orbicularis in transverse section. 6. The inner and outer bundles of the musculus ciliaris Riolani; between the two passes the duct of the Meibomian gland. The alveoli of this latter appear all cut away in various directions. Fig. XVIII. From a vertical section through the ligamentum pectinatum iridis and the adjoining portion of the sclerotic and ciliary muscle. Magnifying power about 200. 1. The spongy mass of elastic trabeculae forming the matrix of the ligamentum

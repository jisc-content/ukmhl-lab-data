385 LENS AND CHORIOIDEA. Fig. XVII. Pigmented connective-tissue cells of the deep tissue of the chorioidea of the same eye ; the cells are very little branched. Magnifying power in all three figures about 350. Fig. XVIII. From a transverse section through the lens of a dog’s eye, showing the lens fibres transversely cut and arranged in strata. The three angular openings cor- respond probably to lymph channels running parallel with the lens fibres. Magnifying power about 350. Fig. XIX. Copy of part of Figure IX. by Iwanoff in the ‘ Handbuch d. gesam. Augenheilkunde,’ by Graefe and Saemisch, part i. p. 280. Showing groups of ganglion- cells in the nerve plexus of the chorioidea of an adult. Fig. XX. Transverse section through the chorioidea of the ox. Magnifying power about 250. 1. Chorio-capillaris. Outside this is a layer of elastic fibrils, Sattler’s layer, shown on the left side of the figure. 2. The layer of large veins, venae vorticosae. 3. The outer layer containing numerous pigmented connective-tissue cells flattened in a direction parallel to the surface. Fig. XXI. From a vertical section through the eye of a sheep’s foetus. Magni- fying power about 30. 1. The rudiment of the eyelid. 2. The sclerotic continued into the cornea. 3. The outer layer of the optic cup, or the pigmented epithelium of the retina. 4. The rudiment of the retina. 5. The epithelium lining the anterior capsule of the lens. At the margin the cells pass into the lens fibres. The nuclear zone of the latter is well shown. 6. The posterior portion of the lens fibres. 7. The rudiment of the corpus vitreum with capillary blood-vessels. Fig. XXII. From a transverse section through the eye of the sheep. Magnify- ing power about 100. 1. Inner portion of the sclerotic. 2. Suprachorioidal lymph-space, permeated by lamellae with pigmented cells. 3. Outer layer of the chorioidea, containing numerous pigment cells. 4. Sattler’s layer.

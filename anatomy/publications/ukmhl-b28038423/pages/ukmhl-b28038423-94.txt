ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. 54 Fig. VIII. From a vertical section through the elastic cartilage of ear-lobe of pig. The explanation is here the same as in fig. VI. In both these instances, viz. figs. VI. and VIII., the cartilage-cells are embedded in hyaline substance ; it has been, however, omitted to represent the cells as situated in lacunae, which anastomose with each other by finer or broader canals. The same communication exists also between the lacunae of the cartilage-cells and those of the cells of the perichondrium. In this latter place they are the interfascicular spaces, as has been figured in fig. IX. of Plate VIII., and mentioned on p. 32.

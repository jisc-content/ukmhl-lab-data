187 DEVELOPMENT OF ENAMEL. The cells of the stratum intermedium of Hannover, besides being used for the formation of part of the above middle membrane of the enamel cap, are also utilised for the regeneration of enamel cells (Waldeyer). By the time the middle membrane disappears, also the stratum intermedium is used up, and the enamel cells are in contact with the outer membrane or the outer epithelium of Kolliker, but separated from it by what appears to be a delicate homo- geneous membrane. The cells of the outer epithelium give origin to the cuticle of the surface of the enamel, as mentioned on a preceding page. The membrana propria above referred to on the inner surface of the enamel cap of the earliest stages, can be still recognised as a sharp boundary line between the young enamel and dentin. Later on it entirely disappears. The tissue of the tooth sack represents the matrix from which the cement is formed ; its structure and function are that of the osteogenetic layer of the periosteum ; the formation of the cement out of that tissue is identical with the subperiostal bone development described in Chapter IX. Already during the stage of the primary enamel organ of a temporary or milk tooth, there is growing out of it a lateral process of epithelial cells ; this represents the rudiment of the enamel organ of the permanent tooth (Kolliker). The formation of this latter takes place on precisely the same plan as that of the temporary tooth. The knowledge of the structure and development of teeth, as described in the foregoing pages, we owe to a great extent to the observations of Purkinje, Schwann, Henle, Nasmyth, Kolliker, Tomes, Huxley, Owen, Retzius, Hannover, E. Neumann, Waldeyer, Hertz, Wenzel, Lieberkuhn, Kollmann, and others, and especially to Charles Tomes by his numerous researches in the field of comparative anatomy of the teeth.

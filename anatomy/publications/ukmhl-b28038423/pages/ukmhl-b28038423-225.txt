153 • DEVELOPMENT OF CAPILLARIES. The small oval nuclei belong to the wall of the vessels. There are four oval nucleated granular corpuscles in the right vessel ; they are young coloured blood- corpuscles. Fig. XVI. Surface view of an artery ensheathed in a perivascular lymphatic vessel, from the frog’s mesentery, stained with nitrate of silver. a. The artery; its deeply-stained circular muscle coat (media) is indicated by broad transverse markings ; outside it is an indication of a lighter stained adventitia. /. Lymphatic vessel; its wall is a simple endothelial membrane. Fig. XVII. From the same preparation as Fig. XV. a. Nucleated protoplasmic cell connected with the wall of a capillary vessel. c. Nuclei of the wall of the capillary vessel. Two coloured blood-corpuscles in the middle part of the figure. The vessel represented here still recalls the branched cell from which it has developed, several of its processes, like the body of the cell, having become hollowed out; two processes are still solid, and a third one is connected with a spindle-shaped looking protoplasmic corpuscle, a, of the surrounding tissue.

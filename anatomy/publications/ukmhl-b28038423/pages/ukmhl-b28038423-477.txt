STRUCTURE OF THE SKIN. 37 5 PLATE XLI. Fig. I. From a vertical section through the skin at the volar side of the human finger. Magnifying power about 40. 1. Stratum corneum. 2. Stratum lucidum. 3. Stratum granulosum. 4. Stratum Malpighii. 5. Papillary layer of the corium. 6. An interpapillary process of the stratum Malpighii continued as the duct of a sweat gland and cut away obliquely. 7. The subcutaneous tissue containing the coiled tube of the sweat glands. 8. The adipose tissue. 9. A Pacinian corpuscle in transverse section. 10. Sweat-gland tubes cut in various directions. 11. An arterial trunk cut transversely. 12. The mouth of a sweat-gland duct. 13. A tactile or Meissner’s corpuscle. Fig. II. Part of a dog’s sweat gland. Magnifying power about 350. 1. The wall of the gland tube is seen from above ; it shows a layer of longitudinal very thin unstriped muscle cells. 2. The duct is lined with a cuticle and a layer of nucleated polyhedral cells. The point where it opens into the gland tube is well marked by the alteration in size and by the difference of the lining epithelium. Fig. III. A part of the layer 7 of figure I. highly magnified (about 400), to show • the structure of the coiled tube of the sweat gland. This consists of two different portions, a proximal and distal one. The former is nearer the duct, possesses the same structure as this, but differs from it by being coiled ; its lumen is lined with a thick homo- geneous membrane ; then follow several layers of small polyhedral cells, of which only the nuclei are here shown. A limiting membrana propria forms the outer boundary. The distal portion is composed of a coiled tube much broader than the former ; its lining epithelium is a layer of columnar transparent or longitudinally striated cells. Between this and the limiting membrana propria is a longitudinal layer of thin unstriped muscle cells.

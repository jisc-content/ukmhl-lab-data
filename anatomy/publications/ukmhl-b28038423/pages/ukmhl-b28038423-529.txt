MACULA ACUSTICA. 419 1. Part of the bony masses of the lamina cribrosa, not represented in detail. 2. Medullated nerve fibres. 3. The superficial layer of nucleated cells of the tunica propria, forming a special nuclear layer. 4. Network of fine nerve fibrils situated already in the epithelium. 5. The sensory epithelium, drawn diagrammatically but without the covering cuticle ; it consists of the superficial layer of conical epithelial cells and a deep layer of spindle-shaped cells, each of the latter is possessed of an acoustic hair projecting over the free surface. Fig. VIII. From a transverse section through the peripheral part of the macula acustica of the utricle of the same preparation as in the preceding figure. Magnifying power about 300. 1. The superficial cuticle, i.e. the lamina reticularis, seen in profile. 2. The superficial layer of conical epithelial cells. 3. The layer of the spindle cells, their acoustic hairs projecting over the free surface. 4. A deep layer of epithelial cells. 5. The fibrous coat. Fig. IX. The sensory epithelium of the macula acustica seen from the surface ; from the same preparation as in the preceding figure. Magnifying power about 300. 1. The superficial cuticle (lamina reticularis) seen from the surface; it possesses large holes for the tops of the superficial epithelial cells and small holes for the acoustic hairs. 2. The cuticle seen in the oblique view; the acoustic hairs are now seen more or less sideways. Fig. X. The stria vascularis of the first turn of fig. I. shown under a higher power, about 350. 1. Ligamentum spirale accessorium, including a blood-vessel. 2. Stria vascularis, pigment and capillary blood-vessels amongst the epithelial cells. 3. A sort of superficial cuticle. Fig. XI. Part of the membrana basilaris seen from the tympanic surface ; from a similar preparation as fig. VI. Magnifying power about 300. 1. A capillary blood-vessel. 2. The epithelial-like cells. 3. Reticulum of cell processes.

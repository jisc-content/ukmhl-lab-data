214 ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. m. Connective tissue mucosa, possessed of numerous minute papillae. mm. Muscularis mucosae, a single layer of longitudinal bundles of unstriped muscle cells. Outside this is the submucous tissue containing mucous gland tubes g, cut in different directions ; the wide infundibula of these pass into the ducts. d. Ducts which after penetrating through the mucosa open with a narrow funnel- shaped mouth on the free surface. Fig. XXVII. From a horizontal section through the mucosa of fundus of stomach of dog ; the section had been stained in aniline blue Magnifying power about 400. The peptic glands are cut transversely, they are arranged in groups separated by connective tissue including numerous unstriped muscle cells. c. Chief cells lining the small lumen of the gland. p. Parietal cells. Owing to the relatively great number of the latter, this section corresponds to a part nearer to the neck than to the fundus of the gland tubes. Fig. XXVIII. From a similar preparation to that represented in fig. XXV., but under a higher magnifying power : about 350. d. Duct; the epithelium is the same on the free surface as in the duct, but the cells become shorter towards the neck. 71. Neck of the gland tubes, the chief cells lining the lumen are short columnar cells directly continuous with those lining the duct; the parietal cells are here very numerous. In the body of the gland the chief cells are longer and more transparent than in the neck, and the parietal cells are less numerous. b. Fundus of gland tubes, its caecal extremity is slightly curved. Fig. XXIX. From a similar preparation as the preceding figure, representing the fundus of a gland tube under a magnifying power of about 450. c. Chief cells ; their substance is a distinct reticulum. p. Parietal cells ; the cell-substance is here a much denser reticulum. The nucleus of the parietal cells is always more transparent than that of the chief cells.

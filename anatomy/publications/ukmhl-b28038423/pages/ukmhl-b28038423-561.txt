445 STRUCTURE OF THYROID GLAND. PLATE XLVIII. Fig. I. From a section through the thyroid gland of the dog. The section had been prepared by Mr. Creswell Baker. Magnifying power about 150. 1. A lymphatic vessel filled with the same homogeneous viscid material as the alveoli. 2. The alveoli or vesicles are lined with a single layer of polyhedral nucleated cells, the cavities of the alveoli are much distended. 3. Lymph-sinuses around the alveoli, the interalveolar lymphatics. Fig. II. Copied from Mr. Creswell Baber, ‘ Philosophical Transactions,’ 1876, II. Plate 47, fig. 5. From a transverse section of the dog’s thyroid gland; the lymphatics had been injected with nitrate of silver. Magnifying power about 90. a. Interior of a large lymphatic cut across. Running across its cavity is seen an artery (b) which is surrounded by the endo- thelial wall of the lymphatic. This endothelial layer is also seen investing the outer surface of the neighbouring vesicles. The nuclei of their lining epithelium are represented at (r) only. Fig. III. From a section through the frontal lobe of the human hypophysis cerebri. Magnifying power about 300. 1. Alveoli in section. They are lined with large more or less columnar epithelial cells. Between these are smaller cells with small and deeply stained nuclei. 2. Homogeneous gelatinous substance contained in a central cavity of an alveolus. 3. Endothelial membranes between the alveoli. 4. A venous capillary in transverse section. Fig. IV. From a transverse section through the human suprarenal body. Magni- fying power about 45. 1. The outer capsule. Part of a section of a large vein of the centre ; around it are numerous bundles of unstripecl muscle cells in transverse section, i.e. running parallel to the long axis of the vein. 2. The cell masses of the outer zone of the cortex. 3 s

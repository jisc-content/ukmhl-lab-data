DISTRIBUTION OF RENAL TUBULES. 265 Fig. II. Copied from Klein, fig. 149 in ‘ Handbook for the Physiol. Laborat.’ Magnifying power about 350. From a section through the cortical substance of a human foetal kidney. a. Glomerulus. c. Epithelium covering the glomerulus. d. Flattened epithelium lining Bowman’s capsule. f. Urinary tubules in section. Fig. III. Copied from Ludwig, fig. 150 in Strieker’s ‘ Manual of Histology.’ Diagram of the vessels of the kidney. at. Interlobular artery. vi. Interlobular vein. g. Glomerulus of Malpighian corpuscle. vs. Vena stellata. ar. Arteria recta. vr. Vena recta. ab. Bundle of arteriolae rectse. vb. Bundle of venae rectae. vp. Network of vessels around the mouth of ducts. Fig. IV. Two fully developed spermatozoa, as seen under a high power. Copied from H. Gibbes, in ‘Quarterly Journal of Micro. Sciences,’ October, 1879. a. Of triton cristatus. b. Of horse. Fig. V. From a section through the ovary of a rabbit, prepared in chloride of gold, showing part of the epithelium lining a Grafian follicle, as viewed in profile. A very beautiful nucleated reticulum is seen stretching from the membrana propria to the zona pellucida of the ovum between the epithelial cells of the membrana granulosa. Mag- nifying power about 350. PLATE XXXVIII. Fig. I. From a vertical section through the kidney of the dog, showing part of the labyrinth and the adjoining medullary ray. The capsule of the kidney is supposed to be on the right-hand side. Magnifying power about 350. a. The capillaries of the Malpighian corpuscle, viz. the glomerulus, are arranged in lobules. Bowman’s capsule with its lining of flat epithelial cells, and the flat epithelial cells covering the glomerulus, are well shown. The stalk of the glomerulus is directed to the left, and is cut away obliquely.

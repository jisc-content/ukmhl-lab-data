STRUCTURE OF HARDERS GLANDS. 34T closely placed against the surface of the eyeball and the inner margin of the nictitating membrane, has been carefully studied by Wendt. It bears a definite relation to the lachrymal glands, being larger in those animals which possess only small lachrymal glands and vice versa. Wendt finds that in the rodents, as mouse, rat, and guinea pig, it resembles a large compound sebaceous gland; in the ox, sheep, and pig it is, however, identical with the lachrymal gland, i.e. is a serous gland, while in the rabbit and hare it consists of two different sections, of which the upper smaller one appears white and resembles the sebaceous gland, while the other, viz. the lower one, is larger, and in the fresh state rose-coloured ; its structure is the same as that of the lachrymal glands ; its alveoli are lined with pyramidal cells, whose protoplasm shows a reticular nature. Injecting the alveolar cavities from the ducts, it is seen that the injection-matter penetrates into the interstitial cement-substance between the epithelial cells. Wendt does not admit that the membrana propria of the alveoli of the rose-coloured or serous portion of the adult gland is a basket-shaped network of flat branched nucleated cells as described by Boll and many others (see former chapters), but considers it a homogeneous non-nucleated membrane. Giacomini found a rudiment of the Harderâ€™s gland also in the Cercopithecus, Cynocephalus, and man.

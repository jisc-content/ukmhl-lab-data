Mucosa pressed into folds, and containing the crypts of Lieberktihn, most of them being cut transversely. The basis of the follicles is surrounded by lymph-sinuses separated from each other by the connective tissue of the submucous tissue, containing the large blood-vessels and lymphatics. c. External circular muscular coat. b. External longitudinal muscular coat, cut transversely. р. Peritoneal covering, separated from the muscular coat by the subserous lym- phatics. Fig. XI. A portion of dog’s pleura mediastini, stained with nitrate of silver. Magnifying power about ioo. a. Fenestrated membrane, its trabeculae are covered with flattened endothelium. b. Large trabeculae, more or less freely projecting over the general surface. с. Nodular masses composed of adenoid tissue and covered with germinating endothelium. b and c contain numerous amorphous black particles, which are carbon particles. The lymphatics of both lungs and the bronchial glands of the same animal were also filled with carbon. This will be referred to in the chapter on the lymphatic vessels. Fig. XII. From a transverse section through a portion of the tonsil of dog. Magnifying power about ioo. e. Stratified pavement epithelium. l. Diffuse adenoid tissue, filling the mucosa and penetrating at the depth of the fold, represented in the middle of the figure, into the epithelium of the surface. f. More or less well-defined lymph-follicles. m. Part of a mucous gland situated in the submucous tissue.

Magnifying power about 150. 1. The pigmented epithelium of the retina; the outer part is unpigmented and includes the oval nucleus. 2. The outer members of the rods, ensheathed in the pigmented filaments of the cells of the epithelium. 3. The inner members of the rods and the cones between them. 4. The region of the limitans externa. 5. The outer nuclei. 6. The outer granular layer. 7. The inner nuclei. They are represented incorrectly too small. 8. The inner granular layer, showing stratification. 9. The nuclei of the ganglion cells. 10. The nerve fibres. The pyramidal extremities of the radial fibres are well shown.

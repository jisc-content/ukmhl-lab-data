IO ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. The so-called blood-crystals par excellence are the haemoglobin crystals; in many kinds cf blood they represent rhombic plates of a bright crimson colour, when obtained from a sufficient quantity of blood. In most mammals they are rhombic plates, e.g. fig. XXI. (copied from Preyer’s book on ‘ Blood-crystals’); in the guinea-pig they are tetrahedral (fig. XX.), and in the squirrel hexagonal plates. Haemoglobin crystals of ox and pig are very difficult to obtain, or not at all. Figure XIX. represents haemoglobin crystals (?) of blood of pig ; they were seen in a very thin layer of fresh blood two to three days after having been mounted as a microscopic specimen. The animal from which the blood had been obtained was diseased.

212 ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. Fig. XVI. The duct and adjoining part of the mucous gland of fig. XI., but more highly magnified, about 450. d. Duct lined by a single layer of transparent polyhedral cells ; these pass into the mucous cells—g—of the infundibulum, but sooner on one side than on the other. The membrana propria with small flattened nuclei is well seen. Fig. XVII. From a section through true salivary gland structure of human sub- maxillary gland. Magnifying power about 350. a. Alveoli cut in different directions. b. Minute intralobular duct cut transversely; its striated epithelium is well shown ; it is surrounded by fibrous-connective tissue. d. Similar duct cut longitudinally. PLATE XXXIII. Fig. XVIII. From a vertical section through the papilla foliata of rabbit. Magni- fying power about 90. f Folds in transverse section, covered with stratified pavement epithelium ; at the basis of each fold are seen the taste goblets. g. Furrows between the folds ; into them open ; d. The ducts of the serous glands. /. Lymphatic vessel in the centre of the folds. Fig. XIX. Three taste goblets more highly magnified, about 300. e. Epithelium around the taste goblets. g. Basis of the goblets next to the mucosa. h. Openings of the goblets with fine hairs. The distinction of the cells of the goblet in taste cells and tegmental cells is not shown here. Fig. XX. From a vertical section through a papilla circumvallata of a child. Magnifying power about 50. a. Fold of mucous membrane surrounding the papilla itself. p. The fungiform papilla, showing minute secondary papillae. Of the stratified epithelium only the nuclei of the cells are shown. At the basis of the papilla are seen the taste goblets. s. Serous gland ; its duct opens at the base of the papilla. in. A small section of a lobule of mucous gland between the lobules of serous gland. b. The vascular mucosa ; the holes are capillary vessels cut in different directions.

25 ENDOTHELIUM OF VESSELS. vessels is a simple endothelial membrane, rolled into a tube. The outlines only—i.e. the cement-substance—of the endothelial cells are shown ; these (cells) are very elongated plates. b. Lymphatic vessels, containing numerous lymph-corpuscles of different sizes. The wall of the lymphatic is also made up of only a single layer of endothelial plates, more or less polyhedral in shape. In this drawing only the upper wall of the lymphatics is represented. Fig. V. Plexus of lymphatic tubes of the diaphragm of dog. Their wall is a single layer of elongated endothelial plates ; only the upper wall of the vessels is represented. At v. semilunar valves are seen in profile, their broad surface being directed towards the lumen of the vessel. Corresponding to the valves, the vessels are possessed of saccular dilatations. The tissue in which the lymphatics are embedded is marked by a brown tint in this and the next figure. Fig. VI. Lymphatic capillaries from the diaphragm of rabbit. The endothelial plates are less elongated than in the lymphatic tubes possessed of valves, like those of fig. V., and show a very sinuous outline. In addition to the endothelium described in the foregoing, the basement membrane is to be mentioned, which in many mucous membranes separates the epithelium of the surface from the subjacent connective tissue of the mucosa. This membrane is not homogeneous, but being an endothelial membrane—the subepithelial endothelium, first described by Debove of the bladder, bronchi and intestine—is composed of flattened nucleated cells, the shape of which varies in different organs, being in some places polyhedral, in others more elongated cells, with straight or sinuous outlines. The membrana propria of the ducts of some glands, e.g. sweat glands (Czerny), is also a membrane composed of a single layer of endothelial plates.

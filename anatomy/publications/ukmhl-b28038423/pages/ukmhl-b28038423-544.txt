ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. 430 3. Malpighian corpuscles in longitudinal section. 4. The same transversely cut. 5. Pulp tissue containing clumps of blood-pigment. Fig. VIII. From a section through the pulp of the human spleen. Magnifying power about 250. a. Venous sinus, lined by a layer of endothelial cells. b. The nucleated cell plates forming a honeycombed reticulum, the matrix of the pulp. The endothelial cells of the venous sinus and the cells of the matrix form a con- tinuity. Fig. IX. From a vertical section through the peripheral portion of the spleen of the pig. Magnifying power about 300. 1. The circular layer of unstriped muscle cells of the outer capsule. 2. The longitudinal layer of the capsule. 3. The pulp tissue next to the capsule. The spaces of the matrix are much dis- tended by blood corpuscles. The endotheloid plates are well shown ; many contain in their interior coloured blood corpuscles. Fig. X. From a section through the spleen of the pig. Magnifying power about 350. 1. Last outrunners of trabecula. 2. Endotheloid plates forming the honeycombed matrix of the pulp. The nuclei of the endotheloid plates are well stained. A few spherical or oval lymphoid cells appear connected with the matrix. Fig. XI. From a section through the pulp of the human spleen. Magnifying power about 450. 1. Endothelial cells of a venous sinus seen from the surface. 2. The circular supporting fibrils of the venous sinuses.

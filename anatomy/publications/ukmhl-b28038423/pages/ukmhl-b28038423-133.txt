STRIPED MUSCLE FIBRES. 83 muscle fibres are large uninuclear plasma cells. The structure of the fibres is the same as represented in figure VI. of the preceding Plate. Fig. XII. Striped muscle fibres viewed in longitudinal and in transverse sections, showing the blood-vessels injected with carmine gelatine. The blood-vessels have chiefly a longitudinal arrangement; the left part of the figure shows both the muscle fibres and their capillary vessels more or less cut transversely. Fig. XIII. Two muscle fibres of hydrophylus, each passing into a tendon bundle of connective-tissue fibres. Fig. XIV. a and b, muscle fibres of diaphragm of adult guinea-pig. The muscle corpuscles are greatly enlarged and very numerous ; they are probably used here for the new formation of striated muscle substance. Fig. XV. Transverse section through several bundles of striped muscle fibres of tongue. The bundles are separated by vascular fibrous-connective tissue, perimysium ; this passes in between the fibres of the individual bundles. The clefts between perimy- sium and muscle fibres and between the individual muscle fibres themselves belong to the lymphatic system. Fig. XVI. Network of muscle fibres of heart of pig.

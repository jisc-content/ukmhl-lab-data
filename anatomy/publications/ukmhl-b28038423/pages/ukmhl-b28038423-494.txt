386 ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. 5. The tapetum nigrum, or epithelium of the retina. 6. The layer of the rods and cones. 7. Limitans externa. 8. The outer nuclear layer. 9. The outer granular or outer molecular layer. 10. The inner nuclear layer. 11. The inner granular layer. 12. The layer of the ganglion cells. 13. The layer of the nerve fibres. The radial or Mtillers fibres passing through the two last-named layers are well shown. Fig. XXIII. Transverse section through the retina of the dog. Magnifying power about 350. 1. The rods and cones. 2. Limitans externa. 3. The outer nuclei. 4. The outer granular layer. 5. The inner nuclei. 6. The inner granular layer. 7. The ganglion cells. 8. The nerve fibres. 9. The limitans interna, being composed of the ends of the radial or Muller’s fibres. Fig. XXIV. Copy of part of fig. XVI, from Schwalbe in ‘ Handbuch d. ges. Augenh.’ by Graefe and Sameisch, p. 371, showing part of the inner surface of the human retina, stained with argentum nitricum. On the right side the radial fibre-cones project with their free basis. Fig. XXV. From a vertical section through part of the frog’s retina. Magnifying power about 350. 1. The outer member of the rods. 2. The inner member, between them the cones. 3. The limitans externa. 4. The honeycombed matrix, in whose meshes are contained the outer nuclei. 5. A nucleus belonging to a connective-tissue corpuscle at the inner boundary of the reticular outer granular layer.

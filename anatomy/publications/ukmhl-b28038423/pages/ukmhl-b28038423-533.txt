421 OLFACTORY MEMBRANE. 3. The hyaline cartilage ; numerous elastic fibrils in its ground-substance. Fig. XIV. From a vertical section through the olfactory mucous membrane of the guinea-pig. Magnifying power about 350. 1. The olfactory epithelium. 2. Nerve bundles in transverse section. 3. A tubular gland of Bowman. 4. The mouth of the duct. Fig. XV. Transverse section from the olfactory region of the guinea-pig. Magni- fying power about 100. 1. Thick olfactory epithelium. 2. Thin olfactory epithelium. 3. Ciliated columnar epithelium. 4. Bone. The tubular glands of Bowman and the nerve bundles of the olfactory nerve, in transverse section, are very abundant in those parts that are covered with the olfactory epithelium. The larger the nerve bundles, the longer the glands and the thicker the olfactory epithelium. Fig. XVI. Transverse section through the nasal mucous membrane in the respira- tory region. Magnifying power about 150. 1. The columnar ciliated epithelium. 2. The mucosa containing diffuse adenoid tissue. 3. The alveoli of a serous gland. 4. Alveoli, the epithelium of which is filled with fatty matter. Fig. XVII. Part of a serous gland as in the previous figure, more highly magni- fied, about 300. 1. Part of an intralobular duct. 2. The same branching into several ‘ intermediary ’ ducts. 3. Alveoli lined with a layer of columnar or polyhedral epithelial cells. 4. Tubular anastomosing alveoli, showing in some places the continuations of the lumen between the lining epithelial cells. The details of the structure of the duct are not represented. Fig. XVIII. From a longitudinal section through the olfactory membrane of the guinea-pig. Magnifying power about 400.

249 STRUCTURE OF ALVEOLI OF LUNG. The mucosa contains mucous gland tubes. Fig. VIII. From a section through the lung of cat, stained first with nitrate of silver and then with haematoxvlin. a. Alveoli lined with large flat transparent nucleated epithelial cells; amongst them are small polyhedral nucleated cells more deeply stained ; they are especially well shown where the alveolar wall is seen in profile. Between the large flat cells are smaller or larger clear spaces corresponding to pseudo-stomata. s. Alveolar septa. s. A group of small polyhedral epithelial cells continued from the bronchus. e. Alveolar duct in section. i. The circular muscle coat. Fig. IX. From a section through lung of a child whose pulmonary artery had been injected with Berlin blue, Magnifying power abopt 25. a. The afferent and efferent vessels ; on account of the low power it is not possible to recognise which is the branch of the pulmonary artery and which of the vein ; but under a high power it can be ascertained that the upper corresponds to the artery. b. The arrangement of the network of capillaries according to the individual alveoli is easily recognised. PLATE XXXVII. (1Copied from Klein's 1 Anatomy of the Lymphatic System.â€™ II.) Fig. X. Section through a large bronchus of the lung of guinea pig ; the blood- vessels had been injected from the pulmonary artery. The injection had escaped through the lymphatics, which are here distended. The section is oblique, and there- fore in the upper part of the figure the bronchial wall is viewed more or less from its external surface. a. Ciliated epithelium lining the inner surface. b. Muscular coat. c. A duct of a mucous gland. d. Veins. e. A branch of pulmonary artery. g. Perivascular lymphatics. h. Peribronchial lymphatics, anastomosing with the former. i. A lymphatic follicle. k. Cartilage. Magnifying power about 50.

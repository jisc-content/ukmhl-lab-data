ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. i^6 medullary sheath, while the axis cylinder divides into several branches; these are more or less convoluted and lost in the matrix. Magnifying power about 700. Fig. X. An end-bulb of the glans clitoridis of rabbit. The nerve fibre possesses an outer sheath of Henle, which is continuous with the capsule of the end-bulb. After having lost its medullary sheath, the axis cylinder enters the end-bulb, becomes much convoluted, and terminates in several small branchlets, possessed of knoblike swellings. Magnifying power 570. Fig. XI. Summit of a Pacinian corpuscle of finger of man, stained with nitrate of silver, to show the endothelial membranes lining the capsules. Magnifying power about 220. Fig. XII. Nerve termination in unstriped muscle of the muscularis mucosae of large intestine of toad, after staining with chloride of gold. The larger fibres belong to the intermediary plexus; two nuclei are shown indicative of nerve corpuscles. The fine fibrils run between the unstriped muscle cells—only their oblong nuclei are indicated here—and terminate in a network. Magnifying power about 350. Figures XIII. and XIV. copied from Arndt, Archiv f. mikr. Anatom. IX. Plate XX. Fig. XIII. Two striped muscle fibres of the hyoglossus of rana temporaria. Magnifying power about 600. a. Nerve end-plate. b. Nerve fibres leaving the end-plate. c. Nerve fibres terminating after dividing into several branches. d. A nucleus in which two nerve fibres anastomose. Fig. XIV. Nerve end-plate in a striped muscle fibre of rana temporaria. Magni- fying power about 1000. A medullated nerve fibre terminates, after dividing into several branches, in the nerve end-plate; this is a granular mass containing numerous nuclei.

ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. 122 Fig. VI. Copied from MacCarthy; a ganglion cell of a spinal ganglion, to show a. the capsule ; b. the nucleated cells lining the capsule, their outline is not well marked ; c. the substance of the ganglion cell; n. nucleus; d. clump of pigment granules. The process of the ganglion cell is not represented. Fig. VII. Copied from Klein, Plate XXXVII., ‘Handbook for the Physiol. Laboratory.’ Magnifying power about 350. From a section through the tongue, stained with chloride of gold, of frog. A. minute artery; a. capillaries; b. plasma cells of the intermuscular tissue ; c. non-medullated nerve fibres; d. fine non-medullated nerve fibres forming a plexus, they possess nuclei indicative of nerve corpuscles. PLATE XXIII. Figs. VIII. and X. copied from Key and Retzius. Fig. VIII. An isolated sympathetic ganglion cell of man; it shows: the capsule lined with nucleated cells ; the nucleus of the ganglion cell with a large nucleolus; three unbranched and one branched process. The cell capsule is continued over all processes as the sheath of Schwann. Magnifying power 750. Fig. IX. A small group of ganglion cells connected with a sympathetic nerve branch of bladder of dog (chloride of gold). The ganglion cells possess each a capsule, the nuclei lining this are represented as if m it. In three cells the process is shown that is continuous with the axis cylinder of a non-medullated nerve fibre. On the right is a large ganglion cell as if dividing. I he detail of structure of the nerve fibres is not shown ; the sheath of the nerve branch is continuous over the ganglion. Magnifying power about 350. Fig. X. Isolated sympathetic ganglion cell of frog, showing the ‘spiral fibre’ of Beale. I his spiral fibre is continuous with the axis cylinder of a medullated nerve fibre, while the ‘straight process’ remains without a medullary sheath. Magnifying power 1,100. Figs. XI. and XII. copied from Klein, Plate XXVI., ‘Handbook for the Physiol. Laboratory.’

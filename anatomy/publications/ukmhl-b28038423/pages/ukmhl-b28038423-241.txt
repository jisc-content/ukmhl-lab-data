165 CHAPTER XXI. THE THYMUS. A. The Framework. A capsule of fibrous tissue surrounds the gland; into the interior of the latter pass septa connected with the former and carrying the arterial and venous branches and the efferent lymphatics. The large septa branch into smaller ones.; by the former the gland is subdivided into lobes, by the latter into lobules. Lamellae of connective tissue, derived from the interlobular septa, pass into the individual lobules, and subdivide them into follicles. The connective tissue of all these parts is composed of bundles of fibrous- connective tissue, more or less arranged as lamellae, separated by the ordinary flat- tened connective-tissue corpuscles, and great numbers of small lymph-corpuscles. In the capsule and the larger septa we meet with a small amount of elastic tissue in the form of networks of fine elastic fibres. The capsule is surrounded by a continuation of the pleura, a delicate connective- tissue membrane with networks of elastic fibrils and numerous capillary blood-vessels, a plexus of nerve fibres and a few lymphatic vessels ; towards the pleural cavity it is covered with a single layer of endothelium. B. The Gland Substance. The follicles are very irregular in shape, most of them being oblong or cylindrical. Near the capsule they are well defined from one another, and present a polygonal outline, often very regular; towards the interior of the gland the follicles become more or less fused. Each follicle consists of a cortical or peripheral and a medullary or more or less central portion (Watney)'; the relation between the two, as regards amount, is not everywhere constant, but in most instances the cortical portion is greater in extent than the medullary. The medulla of neighbouring follicles is occasionally continuous (Watney). The matrix of the follicles is a fine reticulum, differing from the adenoid reticulum, described in the preceding chapter, chiefly in the fact that in the thymus the D D

ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. 360 CHAPTER XXXVIII. THE RETINA. Counting from the outer to the inner surface of the retina, the following layers are distinguished :â€” 1) The uvea or pigmented epithelium of the retina. 2) The layer of rods and cones. 3) The liinitans externa. 4) The outer nuclear layer. 5) The outer granular or outer molecular or internuclear layer. 6) The inner nuclear layer. 7) The inner granular or inner molecular layer. 8) The layer of ganglion cells. 9) The layer of nerve fibres. 10) The limitans interna. 1. The Uvea. The uvea or tapetum nigrum or the pigmented epithelium is the continuation of the same layer of the iris and the ciliary processes ; it is considered a part of the retina, and not of the chorioidea, because it developes, like the retina, from the secondary eye- vesicle or optic cup of the embryo (Kolliker, Babuchin), the former (viz. the uvea) being its outer, the latter (viz. the retina) its inner membrane; and also because the pig- mented epithelium bears an intimate relation to the retina (see below). The individual cells are polyhedral. The substance of the cell is crowded with brownish black pigment rods, which however possess the shape of rhombic flattened crystals with sharp angles (Frisch). Their tint is darker in dark eyes than in light ones. They are slowly bleached by the light in the presence of oxygen (Ktihne), but retain their colour in the absence of oxygen (Mays). The part of the cell next to the chorioidea is generally free of the pigment, and this contains a single spherical or oval clear nucleus generally flattened parallel to the surface. Many of the cells of the albino rabbit contain two nuclei (Schwalbe). According to Angelucci the cells of the rabbit generally are of two kinds : (a) such as possess two, and (&) as possess only a single nucleus. The

LIGAMENTUM PECTINATUM. 381 pectinatum. The nuclei seen on them correspond to the endothelial cells covering them. 2. The meridional portion of the ciliary muscle. 3. The spaces in the spongy matrix of the ligamentum pectinatum. 4. The canal of Schlemm, lined with an endothelial membrane and giving off to the right a narrow channel. 5. The bundles of the sclerotic in transverse section ; between them are seen the nuclei of the connective-tissue corpuscles and networks of elastic fibrils joining those of the trabeculae of the ligamentum pectinatum and of the tendon of the ciliary muscle. Fig. XIX. From a vertical section through the anterior layer of the cornea of a newborn child. Magnifying power about 350. 1. The stratified pavement epithelium. 2. The deepest layer of columnar cells. 3. The anterior elastic membrane of Bowman. 4. The anterior strata of the substantia propria, with the corneal corpuscles seen in profile. Fig. XX. From a vertical section through the anterior layers of the cornea of the rabbit after staining with chloride of gold. Magnifying power about 200. 1. The stratified epithelium ; many of the intraepithelial nerve fibrils are shown, especially those which run horizontally, that is parallel to the surface, in the superficial layer. 2. Long fine nerve fibrils of the subepithelial network derived from a thick branch further down. Some of them appear as if belonging to the deepest layer of the epithelium, but this is due to the fact that fibrils are here shown which in reality lie underneath the epithelium. 3. The anterior strata of the substantia propria. PLATE XLIII. Fig. I. From a vertical section through the anterior portion of the cornea of the rabbit, stained with chloride of gold and haematoxylin. Magnifying power about 400. 1. The stratified anterior epithelium. 2. Bowmanâ€™s membrane. 3. Substantia propria ; the connective-tissue ground-substance is indicated as of a

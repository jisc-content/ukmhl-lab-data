As such they either terminate here or penetrate to the glassy mem- brane along which they may be followed for some distance ; ultimately this is perforated and the nerve fibres penetrate to the cells of the outer root-sheath. The hair-follicle of the tactile hairs possesses a greater supply of nerve fibres than that of the ordinary hairs. According to Bonnet, all hairs, both those with an erectile body, viz. the tactile hairs proper, as well as those without one, viz. the ordinary hairs, possess special nerve- endings. In the ordinary hairs these consist of medullated nerve fibres which in the region of the sebaceous gland form circular tours in the hair-sac, close to the glassy membrane. They pass into fine non-medullated fibres, whose real termination could not be ascertained. In the tactile hairs the medullated nerves entering the hair-sac are very numerous, and form superficial and deep plexuses in the outer and inner coat respectively of the hair-sac. They perforate the glassy membrane, terminate in peculiar end-bulbs on the inner surface of this latter and also between the columnar cells of the outer root- sheath. In the rat and mouse there exists a special plexus of medullated nerve fibres around the neck of the follicle of the tactile hairs, the nerve-ring of Schobel. According to Arnstein, several medullated nerve fibres ascend along the hair-sac, and when arrived at the neck of the hair-follicle of the skin of the back and of the ear of the mouse, pass into non-medullated fibres which branch into several minute fibrils, perforating at the same time the hair-sac; these fibrils either terminate freely on the glassy membrane or they penetrate between the cells of the external root-sheath, where they terminate as an intra-epithelial network. A similar terminal network of fine fibrils, the intra-acinous network, is described by Arnstein, between the epithelial cells of the alveoli of the sebaceous gland.

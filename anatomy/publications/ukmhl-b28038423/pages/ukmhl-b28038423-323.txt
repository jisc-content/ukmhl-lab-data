235 STRUCTURE OF LIVER. l. Liver cells; the intracellular and intranuclear networks are very distinct. c. blood capillaries injected with Berlin blue. Fig. XVII. From a section through liver of guinea pig, showing the transition of the interlobular bile duct d through the intermediary part c into the liver cells l at the margin of the lobule. The canal of the intermediary part passes into the bile capillaries while its flattened cells become continuous with the liver cells. Fig. XVIII. From a vertical section through liver of dog, showing the tissue of a portal canal in transverse section. Magnifying power about 350. a. Artery. b. Bile duct lined with columnar epithelium. v. Interlobular vein. The matrix is formed by bundles of fibrous-connective tissue cut in various direc- tions, because running under different angles. Fig. XIX. From a lobule of the same liver as fig. XIV. Magnifying power about 350. b. Bile capillaries between the liver cells. c. Capillary blood-vessels. Fig. XX. From a vertical section through the liver of pig. Magnifying power about 25. Five lobules are shown well separated from one another. i. Intralobular or central vein. s. Interlobular connective tissue or the tissue of the portal canals.

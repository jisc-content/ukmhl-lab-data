4 ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. 6. Chorioidea with the uvea. 7. Retina. Fig. X. From a vertical section through the ciliary processes of the eye of the ox. Magnifying power about 200. 1. Dense fibrous matrix with pigmented connective-tissue corpuscles, 2. Loose connective tissue ; the capillary blood-vessels in it are omitted. 3. The uvea. 4. Pars ciliaris retinae, a layer of columnar cells. 5. Zonula ciliaris with bundles of fibres in it. Fig. XI. From a meridional section through the eye of an albino rabbit. Mag- nifying power about 60. 1. Cornea. 2. Conjunctiva of the limbus. 3. Sclerotic. 4. Ligamentum pectinatum. 5. Root of the iris. 6. Ciliary processes, covered with the unpigmented uvea ; its cells appear stratified because viewed obliquely. 7. Meridional portion of the ciliary muscle. Fig. XII. A few of the cells of the pars ciliaris retinse of the same preparation as in Figure X., but viewed from the top. The markings between the cells are not per- fect ; the nucleus of the cells contains a distinct reticulum and nucleolus. Magnifying power about 660. PLATE XLIV. Fig. XIII. From a horizontal section through the rabbit’s cornea, stained with chloride of gold, showing two oval nuclei of the superficial epithelial cells, and fine nerve fibrils terminating in a very delicate network. Magnifying power about 660. Fig. XIV. From a horizontal section through the substantia propria of a rabbit’s cornea, stained with chloride of gold, showing several corneal corpuscles and fine nerve fibrils crossing them. Magnifying power about 450. Fig. XV. Branched pigmented connective-tissue corpuscles of the tissue of the iris of the ox, seen from the surface. Fig. XVI. The same seen in profile.

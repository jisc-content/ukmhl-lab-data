359 .CELLS OF CORPUS VITREUM. of the corpus vitreum occur isolated cells at considerable intervals from one another; like the subhyaloid cells, they are possessed of amoeboid movement, and include one, two or three nuclei. They are, according to Ivanoff, either spherical, or more or less branched with or without one or two large vacuoles. Lieberktihn and Schwalbe correctly maintain that these cells are all of the same kind, viz. colourless blood corpuscles; there exist all intermediary forms between them; those with vacuoles are probably degenerating forms.

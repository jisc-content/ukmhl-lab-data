123 GANGLION CELLS WITH SPIRAL FIBRE. Fig. XI. Three ganglion cells with ‘spiral fibre’ in a sympathetic nerve branch of the muscular coat of the bladder of rabbit. Magnifying power about 500. Only the axis cylinders coming off from the ganglion cells are drawn here; the other nerve fibres are left in outline, except the sheath with its nuclei. Fig. XII. From a similar preparation as the preceding figure, showing seven ganglion cells embedded amongst the non-medullated nerve fibres. The upper part of the nerve branch divides into two. Magnifying power about 300. Fig. XIII. Two sympathetic nerve fibres (man) embedded in a thick fibrous sheath of Henle. Each nerve fibre possesses a medullary sheath only from place to place ; this gives it the appearance of a varicose fibre. Magnifying power about 350. Fig. XIV. Several nerve fibres of a sympathetic branch of rabbit. Three are non-medullated and of various sizes; the broad fibre divides into two. One is a fine medullated fibre. The nuclei are indicative of the nerve corpuscles lining the sheath of Schwann. Magnifying power about 350. Fig. XV. A sympathetic nerve branch of mesentery of cat, after nitrate of silver. Its sheath is an endothelial membrane; only the outlines of the endothelial cells are here represented. Magnifying power about 150. u

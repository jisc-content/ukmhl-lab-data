9?. . A TLAS OF HISTOLOGY., , . Fig. XI. A node of Ranvier of a medullated nerve fibre, viewed from above. The medullary sheath is discontinuous at the node, whereas the axis cylinder passes from one segment into the other; at the node the sheath of Schwann appears thickened. Fig. XII. Small dividing (sympathetic) bundle of medullated nerve fibres of mesen- tery, after acetic acid. The fine sheath covering the bundle and its branches, is the perineurium reduced to a single layer of nucleated endothelial plates seen in profile and at a short distance from the nerve fibres. These latter appear composed of longer or shorter sections. This appearance is entirely due to the medullary sheath of these fibres being composed of cylindrical sections, as described and figured above. The nuclei be- long to the nerve corpuscles of Schwann’s sheath of the individual nerve fibres. Fig. XIII. Several fibres of a bundle of medullated nerves, acted upon by nitrate of silver, of sparrow, to show the peculiar behaviour of the nodes of Ranvier towards this reagent. The silver has penetrated through the node and has stained the surface of the axis cylinder at this place for a short distance ; this forms the longitudinal branch of the ‘ cross’ mentioned on a former page. The axis cylinder and the outline of the medul- lary sheath are well seen in each fibre.

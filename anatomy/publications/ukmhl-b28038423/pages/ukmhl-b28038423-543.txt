429 STRUCTURE OF THE SPLEEN. 1. Part of a Malpighian corpuscle ; its vessels are well shown. 2. Pulp tissue immediately around the Malp. corpuscle. The capillaries of this latter open into the network of spaces of the pulp. 3. A venous vessel. Fig. IV. From the same spleen as in fig. II. Magnifying power about 100. 1. Trabeculae. 2. Malpighian corpuscle. 3. Pulp tissue; the venous sinuses are seen in transverse section. Fig. V. From a section through the normal spleen of a monkey. Magnifying power about 350. 1. An arterial branch injected with carmine gelatine. 2. Part of a Malpighian corpuscle. The artery within this latter is surrounded by concentric layers of flattened endotheloid cells, spindle-shaped looking in the profile view. The outlines of the cells are not well shown. This condition precedes the obliteration of the artery. In some of the Malpighian corpuscles of the ape the arterial branch is altogether replaced by a larger or smaller concentric body composed of nucleated flattened cells. Fig. VI. From a vertical section through the spleen of a rat, showing the endo- theloid cells forming the matrix of the pulp. Magnifying power about 350. 1. A trabecula, containing numerous unstriped muscle cells, indicated by their nuclei. 2. Endotheloid plates of the pulp, containing large budding nuclei. 3. A large endotheloid cell-plate filled with coloured blood corpuscles. 4. A large endotheloid cell whose nucleus is dividing, being in the stage of the ‘ Monaster.’ Some of the endotheloid cells contain clumps of blood-pigment. Between the endotheloid cells are small nuclei. These belong either to colourless blood corpuscles or to lymphoid cells more or less connected with the endotheloid cells. The endotheloid cells are more or less branched and connected into a honeycombed spongy substance, not well shown here. Fig. VII. From a vertical section through a monkey’s spleen. Magnifying power about 60. 1. The capsule. 2. The trabeculae.

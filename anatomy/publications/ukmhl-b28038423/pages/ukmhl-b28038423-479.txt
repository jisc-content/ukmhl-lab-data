377 STRUCTURE OF THE HAIR-FOLLICLE. 8. The layers of polyhedral cells from which the cuticle of the hair and the various layers of the inner root-sheath are developed and at whose expense they continue to grow. 9. A layer of spindle-shaped cells, here cut transversely because they are arranged transversely on the long axis of the hair. 10. Cells continuous with the cuticle of the hair and the cuticle of the inner root- sheath. 11. Cuticle of the hair. 12. Thick homogeneous-looking inner root-sheath; its division into Henle’s and Huxley’s layer is not shown here. Fig. VI. Longitudinal section through a bed-hair of the lip of a newborn child. Magnifying power about 90. 1. Stratum corneum of the epidermis. 2. Stratum Malpighii. 3. Hair shaft projecting from the mouth of the hair-follicle. 4. The outer root-sheath. 5. The rudiment of the sebaceous gland. 6. The enlargement of the outer root-sheath around the hair-knob. 7. The rudiment of the new hair, being an outgrowth of the outer root-sheath; it is surrounded by the unstriped muscle cells of the hair-sac. 8. The rudiment of the new papilla. Fig. VII. Longitudinal section through a bed-hair of the adult human scalp. Magnifying power about 60. 1. Epidermis of the mouth of hair-follicle. 2. Hair shaft. 3. Outer root-sheath. 4. Alveoli of the sebaceous gland. 5. Musculus arrector pili. 6. A cystic outgrowth of the outer root-sheath. 7. The hair-knob. 8. The rudiment of the new hair. 9. The rudiment of the new papilla.

ATLAS OF HISTOLOGY. 422 1. The olfactory epithelium consists of: a superficial layer of conical epithelial cells each with an oval nucleus; then follow several layers of spindle-shaped cells, each with a spherical nucleus : these are the olfactory cells. Their one extremity is prolonged beyond the free surface as rod-shaped cilia. In the depth is a layer of inverted conical epithelial cells each with a flattened nucleus. The external limiting membrane of v. Brunn is not represented. 2. Plexus of olfactory nerve fibres. 3. Alveoli of serous glands. Fig. XIX. Part of a serous gland, from a similar preparation as Fig. XVII. Magnifying power about 350. 1. An intralobular duct in transverse section. The columnar cells lining its lumen show well the longitudinal striation. Nucleated fibres, perhaps nerve fibres, surround the duct and appear connected with its epithelium. The lumen of the duct is filled with globules of fatty matter, seen here only in outline. 2, The alveoli; the reticulum in the lining epithelial cells is well shown. Nucleated fibres, perhaps nerve fibres, are seen in the interalveolar tissue, and they appear con- nected with the epithelium lining the alveoli. Fig. XX. From a similar preparation as the preceding figure. Magnifying power about 350. 1. Plexus of bundles of unstriped muscle cells. 2. A minute duct. 3. Alveoli of the serous gland. 4. Vein filled with blood. The ground-substance contains numerous lymph-corpuscles.

2 20 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. vii. removed, the tendon or aponeurosis of the occipito- frontalis comes into view. This is generally called the cranial aponeurosis. Traced backwards, the cranial aponeurosis will be found to end in a fleshj belly, the occipitalis. Separate the aponeuroses in the middle line, and pass the handle of the knife into the cellular interval between it and the pericranium, or periosteum of the skull. It may be noticed how freely the aponeurosis can glide on the pericranium. Extrinsic muscles of the ear are : (1) The attolens aurem, (2) attrahens aurem, (3) retrahens aurem. The skin and subcutaneous tissue are next to be removed from these sn^all muscles. To do this, make a circular incision through the skin of the pinna, about Avhere it meets the side of the head. Then pull the ear for- wards with hooks, and put the retrahens aurem, which lies behind the ear, upon the stretch. Clean it carefully, and make out the posterior auricular nerve and artery passing beneath it. The fibres of this and the following muscles are so pale that great care must be taken not to remove them. The attolens (just above the ear) and attrahens (in front of ear) are to be dissected in a similar manner. A few muscular fibres can be seen upon the pinna of the ear, and senior students should endeavour to make them out and learn them. Temporal iHMScIe.â€”The muscles of the ear having been dissected, the white glistening temporal fascia, which starts from just behind the zygoma, must be removed. An attempt should be made to find its two layers. An incision should be made above and parallel with the zygoma. One layer of the fascia is attached to the outer margin of this process, the other to the inner, so that there is the greatest interval at this point. The temporal branch of the temporo-malar nerve, which pierces the temporal fascia about an inch above the zygoma, and about the same distance

292 The Dissector's AIanual. [Chap. ix. below is called the erector spinas, and the two bundles into which it divides are called the longissinms dorsi ^ and sacro - lumbalis. The con- g tinuations of these muscles have o names assigned to them, but m their names and arrangements B' are best shown in the following ^ ^ Q scheme (Fig. 39), which is copied %^ from Holden's "Osteology." ^ %^ The erector spinse is covered in with an exceedingly dense if I sheath of fascia, called the j_, lumbar aponeurosis. This apo- § g neurosis is derived from the w* ? transversalis muscle of the ab- B I domen in the following manner. ^ £ The fibres of the transver- I salis end, just external to the I transverse processes, in an ^ aponeurosis, which splits into ^ ^ three divisions. The most I 3 posterior passes over the back ^ g of the erector spinse, to be I o attached to the lumbar spines. I This is the portion which is in 8, B. view. The middle part of the ^ aponeurosis goes in front of the I I anterior edge of the erector ^ spinse to the tips of the trans- I / ^ verse processes. The anterior g g' division is in front of the quad- I ratus lumborum, and goes to the g I front of the transverse processes U I, ^-^ lumbar vertebrae (Fig. 16). g Below, the lumbar aponeurosis is attached to the pelvis ; above, it Fig. 39.— Scheme of . i • • i i Muscles of the Back.

244 The Dissector^s AIanual, [Chap. ix. parotid region ; its fibres are thin, or ma}^ be absent, and lie quite close to the surface. It is easiest dis- sected by beginning at the angle of the mouth, and tracing it outwards. The angle of the mouth should be drawn towards the opposite side with hooks, to facilitate the dissection. The muscles below the mouth may now be dissected. Beginning at the angle of the mouth, the fibres of the depressor anguli oris should be traced down, until it is seen to be con- tinuous with the platysma myoides. Partially con- cealed by the depressor anguli oris, and beneath its anterior border, the fairly broad depressor labii inferioris should be looked for. By carefully dissect- ing round and round the mouth, the fibres of the orbicularis oris should be completed, and it will be seen that the fibres of the muscles already described Lying just in front of the fiTiglft of the jnw, and in a slight groove in the bone, is the facial artery. Its course upwards, past the angle of the mouth and by the side of the nose to the inner canthus, should be followed. The muscles beneath which it passes should not be removed, but simply dissected up sufficiently to display the very tortuous course of the artery beneath them. The branches of the facial artery all spring from its anterior border, and run towards the middle line, so that care must be taken in making cuts in this posi- tion. The branches which the facial gives off should be traced as far as possible, and their anastomoses made out. The coronary branches may be followed into the orbicularis oris muscle, which they pierce, but their completion may be left until the mouth is opened, when they will be found lying beneath the mucous membrane. These arteries can easily be felt in this position during life, and the student should feel them and their parent trunk in his own person. Lying behind the facial artery, but running a blend with it.

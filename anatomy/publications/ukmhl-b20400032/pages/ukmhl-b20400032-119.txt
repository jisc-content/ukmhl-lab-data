Chap. IV.] Maintenance of the Body Erect. 105 In order to examine the great interosseous liga- ment which connects the os calcis and astragalus, and which is attached to the large grooves on their adjacent surfaces, these two bones must be separated, or a section made through the astragalus and os calcis. This cannot be done till the last thing, or it will spoil the movements, which must now be demonstrated. By grasping in one hand one end of the foot, and the other in the other end, the joint between the first and second rows of the tarsal bones will be seen to be more or less of a ball-and-socket joint, whilst if the astragalus and os calcis be moved, especially when the tibia and fibula are removed, they will be seen to glide over each other. If the student will try to perform a rotatory movement at the ankle-joint, both on his own foot and also on the part before him, he will soon become conscious that in this movement all the joints just described have a share. The mamtenaiice of tlie body in tlie erect position, and the arcBies of the foot. â€”It seems most appropriate to introduce this question at the end of the dissection of the leg. If the student will refer to the Fig. on page 106, he may see, by aid of the following description, how comparatively little muscular action has to do with maintaining the body in the erect position. The power which belongs to man of maintaining his body in the erect position with comparatively little fatigue is carried to a further extent in some animals ; for example, the horse can go to sleep standing, and so can many birds whilst balanced only on one leg. If the experiment is made, it will be found impos- sible to support a corpse without the aid of extraneous assistance; so that it is evident that something more is required than mere ligaments. If the student will bear in mind the result of his

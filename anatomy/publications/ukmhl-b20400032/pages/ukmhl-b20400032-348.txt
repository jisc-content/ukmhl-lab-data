334 The Dissector^s Manual. [Chap. xiii. As it covers the tendinous insertions of the recti and obliqui, it must be removed before they can be seen. The posterior part of the globe and its muscles is usually concealed by a quantity of orbital fat, which the butcher removes with the globe. This should be removed, to display remainder of the muscles. In the bullock's eye there is an unusual quantity of muscle, owing to the prese.ice of an additional one, called the retractor bulbi. This is a circular tube of muscular fibres, which surrounds the optic nerve, and is attached to the sclerotic in front, and round the optic foramen behind. All the muscles must be cleaned carefully away from the sclerotic. About a quarter of an inch of the large nerve (optic), which enters the globe behind, should be preserved. The exact place at which the optic nerve enters the eye should be noticed. Instead of entering the centre of the globe behind, it enters quite to the inner side of this point. The student should now provide himself with a small basin of water. In winter it will add to the dissector's comfort if the water is warmed a little. "Whenever, during the dissection, the water becomes turbid, it should be renewed. A pair of sharp-pointed, curved scissors will be found most useful. Not less than two or three eyes should be prepared ready for further dissection. The first is to be divided vertically from before, backwards, so as to display its antero-poste- rior section (Fig. 44). The section can be performed moderately well with scissors when the eye is immersed in the water. To get a perfect specimen, a basin of pounded ice, mixed with salt (equal parts of ice and salt), should be obtained. ' The eye should be kept covered with the mixture until quite hard, when a section may be made through it with a razor. The eye should be placed upon a piece of cork or soft wood, and a rapid section made. When this has

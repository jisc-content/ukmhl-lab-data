[Chap. X. 3o6 The Dissector's ATanual, which lies just internal to the posterior cornu of the thyroid cartilage, and has been seen, long before the pharynx was separated from the vertebral column, running up by the side of the oesophagus. Situated on the top of the cricoid cartilage behind, will be seen two small pyramid-shaped masses covered with mucous membrane. These are the arytenoid cartilages; and running forward from them to the sides of the epiglottis are two folds of mucous mem- brane, the aryteno-epiglottidean. The space between these folds is termed the upper aperture of the larynx. In front of the epiglottis, and connecting it with the tongue, are three folds of mucous membrane, one in the middle, and one on either side called the glosso- epiglottidean folds. If the student looks into the upper aperture of the larynx, he will see two bands on each side, separated by a small cavity, the ventricle of the larynx. These bands are the superior (false) and the inferior (true) vocal cords, which latter are concerned in the produc- tion of the voice sounds. The true vocal cords can be made to diverge or come into close contact at will, and can likewise be rendered lax or tense. These move- ments can easily be shown in the following manner. If the cricoid cartilage and trachea are firmly grasped in one hand, the thyroid can be made to move up and down over the front edge of the cricoid, its lower angle behind, where it articulates with the cricoid, acting as the hinge. As the thyroid cartilage moves down over the cricoid in front, the true vocal cords will be seen to become tense, whilst movement in the opposite direction renders them lax. This action is effected by the crico-thyroid muscle in front, which has probably been dissected before with the front of the neck. If not, it will be readily discovered stretching on each side of the thyroid cartilage from it to the cricoid, and must be cleaned.

Chap. I.] How TO Learn Anatomy. 5 deep fascia. This will better be appreciated if the student will refer to the diagram of the cervical fascia in section on page 256. Besides tlie sheath of deep fascia, each structure ha^a^Â£ecial^as^^ nective tissue, and called, in the case of the muscle, perimysium^ in case of the vein, artery, and nerve, their connective tissue sheath. It is in these connec- tive~~tissue sheaths aiid in the superficial fascia that the fat is princm^l^ cont^me^cl^ Dj^section^^tne cutti^^ aivay of this connective i tissue^nd deep^\"ascia, aiid the "exposure, as nearly j as^possible iiTtheir relative position, of the inusdes, / vessels, nerves, bones, and viscera. The process of/ divesting~the muscles, etc., of connective tissue is called cleaning them. To effect this the connective tissue sheath should be firmly seized with the forceps and put upon the stretch ; a cut should be made into the sheath, and then the structure must be skinned of its connective tissue, by gently cutting as near it as possible without injuring it. As a rule the student has no difficulty in determining when he has reached the muscle, vein, etc., and when he is only cutting connective tissue, for the latter is loose whilst the muscle, etc., is firm, hard, and of a different colour. ^ I/Structure is said to be clean when it does not look Itouffy \i thp,^~HTigmuis-jmlihedr^v it, and when its surface aiid^ fibres are clearly displayed. It is very I easy to remove only a part'"of fIie~connective tissue sheath, but great care must be taken to try and remove it in one layer, for if this mistake is made, the process has only to be repeated. It may be looked upon as a principle in cleaning, that the student should begin where a structure is large and prominent, and work steadily to the other side or end ; but never pick off a little piece here and there. If this is done, the part presents a ragged

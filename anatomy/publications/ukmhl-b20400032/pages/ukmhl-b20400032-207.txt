Chap. VI.] Back of Sternum, 193 the front of the chest (i.e., nearest the sternum) two arteries will be seen, one, the larger, running along the groove on the under surface of the rib, and another, much smaller, coursing along the upper surface of the rib below. If these two arteries be traced far enough back they will be found to come off from a common trunk, whilst if traced onwards toward the sternum, the larger one anastomoses with the internal mammary. The smaller one sometimes does so as well, but is usually lost in the muscles before it reaches this point. If the internal mammary artery be laid hold of in the forceps, and pulled slightly, there will be seen to be a small branch which passes through each inter- costal space, and is accompanied by a small vein and nerve. The terminations of these on the front wall of the chest have already been dissected under the name of the anterior perforating vessels and nerves, when the skin was removed during the dissection of the arm. The student should not omit to satisfy himself by inspection whether there is an anterior branch to the nerve in the first intercostal space, as it is usually absent, or too small to be made out without special dissection. (Vide page 214.) The lateral cutaneous nerves which pierce the intercostal muscles in the axillary line will be seen if search is made at that situation. The sternum, with about three-quarters of an inch of the costal cartilages attaclied, should now be pre- served for the dissection of the ligaments. Ligameiits. Anterior and posterior costo- feternal. Capsular. Interarticular to second and third ribs. After clearing the sternum from all superfluous fat and muscle, it should be set to soak in water for N

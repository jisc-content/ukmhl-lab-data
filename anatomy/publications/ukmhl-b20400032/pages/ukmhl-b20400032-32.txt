The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. III. i8 grasped with the hand, so that the thumb is in front, and firmly pressed into the hollow beneath the junc- tion of the outer with the middle third of the clavicle. The process lies just internal to the head of the hu- merus, so that, to avoid confusion, the arm should be rotated. The head of the humerus, of course, turns; the coracoid does not. (To do this, the arm must be detached from the board, and considerable force used.) In the male the nipple lies over the fifth intercostal space. (Vide Frontispiece.) It is of importance, as it indicates the position of the heart's apex, etc. The lower border of the pectoralis major is well defined, and forms the front boundary of the armpit (axilla). Before making any skin incisions, the student must remember that he is going to remove the skin in as thin a layer as possible, leaving all the subcutaneous fat upon the surface of the muscles. This subcuta- neous fat contains the cutaneous nerves, cutaneous blood-vessels, and the mammary gland, so that, unless care is taken in removing the skin, these struc- tures are liable to be destroyed. If this be the first attempt at dissection, the student may easily fail in his endeavours to find either nerves, blood-vessels, or glands ; but as a great many nerves and vessels require to be dissected during the next stage, this is a good opportunity of gaining a little experience. In this country subjects for dissection are so difficult to obtain, and the time which the examining l:)oards permit to be devoted to anatomy is so short, that in nearly all schools an attempt is made to display all the more important structures upon one part. Under more favourable circumstances, the first part should be devoted only to the study of the muscles and largest vessels and nerves. The skin may therefore be re- moved from the surface by the following skin incisions. 1. From sternal end of clavicle outwards to the middle of its concavity.

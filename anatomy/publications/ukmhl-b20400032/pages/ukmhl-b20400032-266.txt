252 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. further manipulation. Cut througli the neck with a saw-cut and complete the horizontal cut (4) through the ramus. The vertical bit (3, Fig. 36) must be taken away. Next, open the capsule of the maxil- lary articulation above the insertion of the external pterygoid. This opens the synovial cavity above the intra-articular fibro-cartilage. With the handle of the knife, and by cutting the remaining portions of the capsule, the fibro-cartilage and condyle of the jaw may be turned out of the glenoid cavity, and pulled well forward with hooks. The external pterygoid muscle will be seen to be attached both to the neck of the condyle and to the front of the fibro-cartilage, and should be pulled well forwards by means of hooks fastened into the fibro-cartilage. The first part of the internal maxillary artery, and other structures which lie between the jaw and its internal lateral ligament, can now be easily completed, and the inferior division of the fifth nerve and otic ganglion dissected. The branches of the inferior maxillary nerve present no difiiculties, except the auriculo-temporal. This nerve is closely adherent to the back of the capsule of the inferior maxillary articulation, and is surrounded by dense parotid gland. Moreover, it communicates very freely with tlie facial. A sharp knife and great patience will be required to make out the nerve and its two roots of origin. Great care must be taken not to pull upon its trunk, or the slender branches which it gives off* to the ear and auditory meatus will be broken. The external pterygoid must be pulled strongly upwards and forwards with hooks to enable this to be done. To find the otic ganglion the student should follow the upper margin of the internal pterygoid muscle up to its highest attachment; a nerve about three-quarters of an inch long will be found entering its upper border. If this, which is the nerve to the

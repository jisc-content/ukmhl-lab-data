Ventricles, Chap. XIV.] 351 ]>isse€tioii of ventricles.—Presuming that no tearing has been done, and that the brain is still intact, its interior may now be examined. It has been mentioned that an interval exists between the great ganglia of opposite sides; it has now to be seen that the hemispheres are hollow in their interior. These hollows are called ventricles, and communicate with each other. Of course, the ventricle between the optic thalami, third ventricle, is in the middle line. The ventricles in the hemi- spheres are at each side of it, and are called lateral. The lateral ventricles are situated beneath the fibres of the corpus callosum, as they spread out into the hemispheres and above the great ganglia. Roughly speaking, therefore, the floor of the lateral ventricles is formed by the optic thalamus and corpus striatum; the roof by the corpus callosum. When the lateral ventricle is opened, it will be seen to send a pro- longation, or horn, into each of the great lobes, frontal, temporo-sphenoidal, and occipital. To expose the lateral ventricle, the cerebral hemispheres are to be sliced away in the following manner : A very thin and flat knife, with a blade about twelve inches long, should be obtained (this is not absolutely necessary), and its blade dipped in dilute spirits before it is used. The hemisphere should be supported with the left hand, and sliced ofl" at the level of the corpus callosum. This section shows that the surface of the convolutions is covered with grey matter, and that their interior is composed of white (centrum ovale majus). If the brain were fresh, the small veins would be seen as red points on the surface of the section (puncta vasculosa). A little way from the corpus callosum the handle of the scalpel should be used to plough up the white matter, or very thin slices may be removed with the knife; a villous and vascular-looking structure will

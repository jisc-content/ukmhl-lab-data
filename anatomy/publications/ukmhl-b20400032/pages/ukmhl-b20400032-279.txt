Chap. IX.] Superior Carotid Triangle. 265 to defer awhile the further consideration of the contents of this triangle, but the attachments of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles may be partially got out. A great many lymphatic glands surround all the great vessels of the head and neck. They are called the glandul{3e concatenat{3e, and should be removed when they obscure the view of the other structures. To remove them, they should be seized with the forceps and dragged upon; whilst this is done, the knife should be applied close to their capsule, until they are free. The superior ee^rotid triang-fe.—The bound- aries of this triangle have already been described. They should now be clearly defined. The contents which are to be dissected are : Common carotid artery, and its division into External carotid and Internal carotid. Branches of external carotid : Superior thyroid. Lingual, Facial. Occipital. Ascending pharyngeal. The veins which run with these arteries, and which empty themselves into the internal jugular: The floor, consisting of Portions of thyro-hyoid. hyo-glossus. „ middle constric- tor. „ inferior constric- tor. Hypoglossal nerve, and its branches. C Descendens nerve, j Nerve to thyro-hyoid mus- ( cle. Pneumogastric nerve. Superior laryngeal nerve. Spinal accessory nerve. Sympathetic. Larynx ) ^ Pharynx) Partially. ^ Greater cornu of hyoid bone. The coverings of the triangle having been previously dissected may now be removed. No particular direc- tions are requisite for the removal of the deep cervical fascia from this space. When this has been done, the boundaries of the triangle should be clearly defined,

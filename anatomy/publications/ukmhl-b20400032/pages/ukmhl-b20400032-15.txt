The Dissector's Manual. CHAPTER I. HOW TO LEARN ANATOMY. Anatomy means tlie science of structure. To learn human anatomy, therefore, is to understand the struc- ture of the human body. In this book, and by the methods which are here described, only naked-eye anatomy can be learnt. Microscopic anatomy, or histology, must be learnt by different methods, and is described in a separate work. The term " anatomy " in the ensuing pages will be employed in reference only to that portion of the subject which is capable of being studied by the unaided eye. It is possible to learn this subject in a variety of ways; the student might learn it by dissection only, without the aid of a single book or bone. Such a method was the only one that could be employed before anything of the science was known, or before any books were written on the subject; but experience has shown that the method which we are about to describe is the best, having due regard to the fact that the student's time is limited, and that a very accurate knowledge is indispensable. The learning of any new subject involves always a certain amount of drudgery, and anatomy is certainly no exception. A number of new^ and, at first, mean- ingless, names have to be committed to memory, and repeated again and again_, before any progress is made. B

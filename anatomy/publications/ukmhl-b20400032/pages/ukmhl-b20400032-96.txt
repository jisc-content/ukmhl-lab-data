The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. IV. 82 deeper parts as well, and renders the dissection of this part always difficult. In a good body the student may expect to find a branch of the last dorsal, two or three lumbar, i.e., iliac branches of the ilio-inguinal and ilio-hypogastric {vide Fig. 15), three sacral branches from the sacral foramina, and branches from the lesser sciatic, which curl up round the lower border of the gluteus maximus. It is impossible to give any very definite directions for finding the nerves. To search for them the student should begin at the outer side of the iliac crest, and, carefully removing the superficial fascia in a series of thin layers by vertical cuts, and scraping with the point of his knife, he will discover the last dorsal nerve about the junction of the anterior with the middle third of the ilium ; an inch or two farther back and he will come upon iliac branches from ilio- inguinal and ilio-hypogastric. When these are found he must go slightly to the inner side of the posterior superior spine, and about midway between it and the sacral spines the three small sacral branches lie. If the body is well injected, three small arteries will possibly form a guide to their whereabouts; if not, they can only be found by careful scraping and dis- section. They are very small, and easily overlooked. Along the fold of the buttock some branches of the small sciatic ascend. They are the easiest of all the nerves of this region to find. If the student sci-ape and dissect about the middle of this fold he ought to find one branch, and then he will easily trace the others. Sometimes an artery is present as a guide. As soon as these nerves are found, or the student thinks he has expended enough time and patience on the search, the superficial fascia must be taken off in one piece, and the gluteus maximus exposed. It is a large coarse muscle, and very difficult to clean ; in fact, it is only possible to clean it by taking the fascia

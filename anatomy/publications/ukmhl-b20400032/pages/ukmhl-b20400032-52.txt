The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iii. 38 l>is§ectioia of tSie paluni of ttae fifisind*—The following surface markings require to be made out: Tuberosity of scaphoid* Eidge of trapezium. Pisiform bone. Unciform process. Thenar and hypothcnar emi- nences. Superficial and deep palmar arches. Line of metacarpo-phalangeal joint. The bony prominences caii easily be recognised by reference to an articulated hand. The thenar emi- nence is the prominence formed by the muscles of the thumb ; the hypothenar eminence is that formed by the muscles of the little finger. The line of the superficial palmar arch is indicated b}^ a line drawn across the palm at the level of the flexor surface of the outstretched thumb; the deep palmar arch is about an inch nearer the wrist. The metacarpo- phalangeal joint is marked by a transverse line situated about midway between the bases of the fingers and the line of the superficial palmar arch. The skin of the palm may be reflected by the following incisions : {a) a vertical one, from the centre of the circular incision above the wrist to the fork between the ring and index fingers; (6) a transverse incision across the base of the fingers; (c) along the thenar eminence, from the scaphoid tubercle to the tip of the thumb; (r/) along the palmar aspects of any of the fingers. The cutaneous nerves which lie in the palmar fat are small branches of the median and ulnar nerves which cross the annular ligament. They are small, and diflicult to find, but as they run vertically, any incisions made to find them should take this direction. A small muscle (palmaris brevis) is also to be looked lor in the fat over the hypothenar eminence. As it runs trans- versely, incisions made to find it should ran in that

ii6 J'he Dissector's Manual, [Chnp. v. Along with the fat some lymphatic glands will be removed, in the neighbourhood of the groin. The deep fai^cia.—When the fat is all removed, a more or less glistening membrane (deep fascia) will come into view, through which the subjacent muscles will be readily visible. Here there will be seen some minute holes in this fascia, through which may be seen emerging the minute nerves and arteries that have before been found; and other holes, proclaiming by their emptiness the positions of nerves and vessels that have been cut away. The external atodomiiaal ring*.— Just over the crest of the pubes a hole will be seen, oblique in direction, as large perhaps as an almond, and bounded on either side by two strong bands of fascia. This is the external abdominal ring, and the two bands of aponeurosis bounding it are called the external and internal pillars of the ring (Fig. 17, page 121). It gives passage to the spermatic cord in the male sub- ject, and in the female, in which it is usually smaller, to the round ligament. This ring must be very care- fully dissected, and the inguinal branch of the ilio- inguinal nerve, which has been before alluded to as emerging from it, should be traced onwards to its ultimate destination in the external generative ap- pendages. The student must not forget that all the nerves which have been found so far come round from the spine, and will have to be traced farther back, to their origin, at a later stage of the dissection. The muscles which form the wall of the abdomen are as follows : External obHque. I Transversalis. Internal oblique. I Rectus and pyramidalis. It will now be readily seen that the fibres of the most superficial muscle (external oblique) run down- wards and inwards.

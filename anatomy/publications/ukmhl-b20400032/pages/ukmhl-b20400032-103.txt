Chap. IV.] Back of Leg and Ankle. 89 anastomose on the front of the patella, and join with the recurrent tibial to form the patella anastomosis, which has already been dissected. To follow them completely, it is necessary to cut across the hamstrings and part of the vasti ; but it is better not to do this at present, but rather to be content with the somewhat limited view that is obtained by pulling these muscles aside. BACK OF LEG AND INNER ANKLE. Sm-face Harhings. Prominence of heel. Tendon of gastrocnemius (tendo AchiUis). Line of peroneal and terior tibial arteries. The prominence of the heel which is formed by the OS calcis needs no mention; its situation is obvious. The tendon of the gastrocnemius, tendo Achillis, can be readily felt running up for several inches from the heel, and is best felt on the student's own body. A line drawn from midway between the two condyles of the femur to midway between the inner malleolus and the inner edge of the heel will indicate the line of the posterior tibial artery. The peroneal is represented by a line drawn from the centre of the lower part of the popliteal space as far as the junction of the lower with the middle third of the fibula. The principal structures to be dissected on the back of the leg are as follows : Parts at inner ankle, viz.: / TibiaHs posticus. I Flexor longus digitorum. J Posterior tibial artery and ] veins. I Posterior tibial nerve. Flexor longus polHcis. Peroneal artery and veins. External saphenous nerve and vein. Gastrocnemius. Soleus. Plantaris. Fophteus.

The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. xv. 370 this cannot be seen ; the same remark applies to the pia mater. The dura mater should afterwards be taken away. To do this, the nerve roots should be cut through outside it. The posterior common liga- ment may now be cleaned from beginning to end. The ligaments which unite the head to the spine are next to be examined. They may be conveniently classified into : (1) Those connecting occipital bone and atlas : Anterior occipito-atloid. I Capsular. Posterior occipito-atloid. | Lateral occipito-atloid. (2) Ligaments connecting occipital bone and axis : Occipito-axoid- j Three odontoids. (3) The ligaments connecting the atlas and axis. The anterior occipito-atloid and atlo-axoid require no special rules for their dissection. Any remains of the small muscles in this region should be removed. The anterior occipito-atloid ligaments, although divided into superficial, deep, and lateral, are really only one ligament. Within the canal, the upper part of the posterior common ligament, where it stretches from the back of the body of the axis to the occipital bone, is called the occipito-axoid, or apparatus liga- mentosus colli. It should be divided just below the prominence of the tip of the odontoid process, and its ends turned upwards and downwards. The trans- verse or cruciate ligament, which keeps tlie odontoid process in place, may then be cleaned, and afterwards the odontoid, or check ligaments, traced from the odontoid process to the occipital bone. A couple of vertebrÂ£e may be taken from the middle of the column, and divided vertically with a saw. The structure of the intervertebral disc and of the bodies of the verte- brie may then be examined. Upon the bone the vense basis vertebrarum and vertical cancelli are easily seen.

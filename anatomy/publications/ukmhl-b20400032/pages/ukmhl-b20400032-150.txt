136 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. v. Before attempting to remove the testicles, the student should make a tiny cut into the sac (tunica vaginalis), in which the testicle lies quite loose and free, insert his blow-pipe and distend it, so as to make out exactly where it is attached to the testicle, and how far it extends up the cord. The distance which it passes up the cord varies considerably, from about one quarter of an inch and upwards. It may, in some cases, be connected with the peritoneum in the adult, whilst in the fcetus this connection is always unmistakable. In addition to this, it will be readily seen, when the tunica vaginalis is distended, that there is no space between it and the testicle behind, and that the epididymis and vessels do not perforate but pass in behind it. A little dissec- tion at this point will render it quite clear that the tunica vaginalis is reflected over the testicle, and belongs to that class of structures called serous sacs. This fact will be rendered still more clear when the tunica vaginalis is slit open. This can be done now or later on. The cord must be severed close to the external ring, and the testicle can either be dissected at once or kept moist for future examination at leisure. The testicle should be pinned out on a board or bit of cork, resting on its back surface; the tunica vaginalis slit in front, and reflected. The testicle will then be seen, covered on its back and outer surface by another mass, the epididymis, and passing up behind it is the spermatic cord. There is usually to be seen at the upper end of the epididymis in the fossa, between it and the body of the testis, an oval body about the size of a small apple-pip, which is called the hydatid of Morgagni; and on the cord itself, just above the testicle, some little excrescences, the organ of Giraldes, may be present.

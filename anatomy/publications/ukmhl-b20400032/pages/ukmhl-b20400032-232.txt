All incisions, iwhetherlnade by the dissector or surgeon, should take a corresponding direction. The nerves of the scalp will be found much more difficult to discover than the arteries. The accompanying diagram (Fig. 29) may aid in showing their positions.

To lind them it is best to make an incision through the orbicularis parallel to the margin of the orbit, seeking carefully for the nerves, v^hich are very liable to be divided by an incision over their course. The supra- orbital is easiest to find, as the notch in frontal bone, through which it emerges, may be sought for. When discovered, the nerves should be traced up as far as possible. They are very thin and delicate, so that no traction should be made upon them, and only theii*

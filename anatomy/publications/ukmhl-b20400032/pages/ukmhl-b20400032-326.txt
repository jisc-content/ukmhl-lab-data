312 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. x. On tlie tops of the arytenoid cartilages, two sepa- rate little pieces of cartilage will probably be seen (the cornicula laryngis). They lie in the aryteno-epi- glottidean folds, and have already been felt before the mucous membrane was removed. Passing upwards from the top edge of the thyroid cartilage to the under and back surface of the hyoid bone, is the thyro-hyoid membrane, already well seen and cleaned. Connecting the tips of the thyroid cartilage with the tips of the great corona of the hyoid, a stout fibrous band can be seen^ containing the cartilago-triticea, which is generally unequally deve- loped on the two sides. These fibrous bands are only the posterior borders of the thyro - hyoid membrane, but are called the posterior thyro-hyoid ligaments. Lastly, if the epiglottis be carefully divested of its mucous membrane, there will be seen the two fibrous bands which connect it with the thyroid carti- lage and hyoid bones respectively. On the upper surface of the epiglottis are some small pits about the size of a pin's head, which lodge small glands. The tracliea.—The connective tissue should be dissected off the trachea, so as to display its rings, and the fibrous tissue which unites them to each other and to the larynx. Behind, the rings will be found to be joined by some unstriped muscular tissue, to which the name musculus trachealis has been given, and when the trachea is opened its mucous lining will be displayed. The lower part of the trachea and bronchi will be dissected with the lungs in the thorax. Dissection of tlie tofiiS"iie.—After the larynx has been dissected, the tongue still remains for dissec- tion. Many of its most important attachments have been divided, but it still remains fastened to the

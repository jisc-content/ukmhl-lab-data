Chap. XL] Aqueduct of Fallopius. 323 (Vide Fig. 43, page 331). At this point it has a slight swelling upon it, called the geniculate ganglion (intu- mescentia ganglioformis). After the ganglion the facial nerve is seen to turn backwards to pass between the vestibule and tympanum. Its dissection may be continued. Using the bone forceps very carefully, the bone should be removed from the vestibular side of the Fallopian aqueduct, and the nerve exposed. At this stage the end of the stapes can be distinctly seen in the vestibule, looking through the fenestra ova- lis. The tensor tympani muscle should again be pulled upon to see what effect it has upon the stapes. The vertical portion of the facial nerve may next be ex- posed. With the bone forceps the back of the petrous bone should be gradually removed, and the nerve traced down from its horizontal part as far as the stylo-mastoid foramen. When the canal is freely opened, some muscular fibres (the stapedius) will be seen in it. If the bone over the back and upper part of the tympanum be removed with bone forceps, the small muscle may be seen entering the cavity through the pyramid, and going to be attached to the neck of the stapes. Lower down, the chorda tympani may be seen arising from the facial, and passing through the tympanum between the malleus and incus. A branch of the facial nerve enters the stapedius as it lies in contact with it, but is not likely to be discovered. The small stylo-mastoid artery, if in- jected, may be seen running up the aqueduct to enter the tympanum. It anastomoses round the edge of the membrana tympani with the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary artery. If minutely inspected, these vessels can be seen forming a circle around the membrane, and sending branches down the handle of the malleus to supply the middle of the membrane. There still remains for examination the internal

Chap. III.] Dissection of the Arm. 45 Before doing this, the student should recapitulate all the parts cut through in removing the arm from the body. The skin having been reflected from the surface of the deltoid, a cutaneous nerve may be looked for winding round its posterior edge, to supply the skin which covers the muscle. It comes from the circum- flex nerve, and is a good example of the very general rule which says that the nerves which supply muscles supply the skin which covers them. Tiie acromial branches of the superficial cervical plexus will have been traced to the surface of the deltoid by the dissector of the head and neck. When these cutaneous nerves have been found, the surface of the deltoid must be cleaned from origin to insertion, and the muscle reflected from its origin. The process of reflection should begin at the posterior end of the spine of the scapula, and as the muscle is turned forwards the posterior circumflex artery, vein, and nerve will be seen entering its under surface. When they have been found, the fat and connective tissue which surround them must be removed, and great care be taken to trace a branch of the nerve into the teres minor, and a branch of the artery into the long head of the triceps. These branches are given off -^from the posterior circumflex nerve and artery just after they have emerged from the quadrilateral space previously mentioned. The nerve as it enters the muscle often has a gangliform swelling upon it; and the artery is very important, because when it has entered the long head of the triceps it anastomoses with a branch of the superior profunda which enters it as the artery crosses the muscle. This is the only anastomotic channel by which collateral circulation can be carried on when the axillary artery is tied in the third part of its course, that is, beyond all its branches. The supraspinatus, teres major and minor, and infraspinatus, should each be cleaned in their

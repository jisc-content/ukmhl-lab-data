20 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. iii. and close to the clavicle, the descending clavicular branches of the cervical nerves should be found. They lie quite close to the bone, and frequently groove it \ they sometimes pierce it. Having been found in this region, they should be traced down- wards. The nerves themselves should not be taken hold of by the forceps, but the subcutaneous tissue alongside should be pulled away from the nerve, and divided along its course. The lateral branches of the intercostal nerves which wind round the pectoralis major, are more difficult to find, owing to their small size and the large quantity of fat which usually exists in this region. The small anterior branches of the intercostal nerve may be found coming out of the front portion of the intercostal spaces along with small arteries, which may serve as guides to them. If the body is lean they present no great difficulty, but the aid of a skilled dissector should be obtained if the subject is fat. I>issectioii of maminary g'laiicl. â€” In a favourable subject the mammary gland should now be dissected. A female about 30 years old would be the likeliest to afford a good one. The gland is small in the male, and can hardly be said to exist in many of the very old bodies which find their way to the dissecting-room. If the subject is not a favourable one, the pectoralis major may be cleaned at once ; but supposing the mamma is well-developed, the gland will be found beneath the nipple lying upon a mass of fat. The gland substance may be dis- tinguished from the fat by its finer, and closer, and more opaque appearance. The student should endea- vour to make out its circumference and lobes. Under favourable circumstances its ducts, about twenty in number, with their dilatations (ampullae), may be found by making incisions into the gland. The in- cisions should be in the course of the ducts, and

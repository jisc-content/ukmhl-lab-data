The Eye. Chap. XIII.] 333 to the fangs of all the teeth in the upper jaw. To see it the bone should be carefully removed with bone forceps or file. To do this the upper wall of the infraorbital foramen should be taken away, and the anterior dental nerve traced down from the infraorbital. Above the fang of the canine tooth the two nerves meet, and make a sort of plexus (ganglion of Boch- dalek). If the bones have been previously soaked in nitric acid, the earthy salts are removed, and their branches can almost be seen without any dissection; if not, the plexus will probably be overlooked. CHAPTEPv XIII. DISSECTION OF THE EYE. Human eyes are not available for dissection, but the eye of an ox, sheep, or pig will serve to display all that is requisite. It will be presumed that the student has obtained three or four bullocks^ eyes in as fresh a condition as possible. Any butcher will provide them at a short notice. The attachments of muscles to the exterior of the globe has already been studied with the dissection of the orbit. However, this is a favour- able opportunity to revise them. The conjunctiva, which is the loose mucous membrane covering the front of the eye, should be removed. Beneath it there is some very delicate and loose connective tissue, so arranged as to form a sort of serous sac round the front of the eye. This connective tissue is called the capsule of Tenon, and it facilitates the movements of the globe. If, in a fresh body, the conjunctiva be gently seized with the forceps, it can be lifted up alone : seized more strongly, the capsule of Tenon is grasped. If a snip be made with scissors, a probe can be passed into a sac which is formed by the capsule.

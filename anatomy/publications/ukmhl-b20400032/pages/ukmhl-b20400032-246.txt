232 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. carotid artery lies in the sinus, close to the posterior clinoid process, and in close contact with it is the sixth nerve. The student should endeavour to see whether the artery is bathed in the blood of the sinus or not. Surrounding the carotid artery, in a close mesh work, is the sympathetic. The dissection should be begun with the third nerve, which must be traced as far as the sphenoidal fissure. The fourth nerve lies very close to it, and may be traced forwards from beneath the margin of the tentorium cerebelli; when it has been found, care must be taken not to pull upon it with the forceps : being very thin and delicate, it is easily broken. Upon a fresh and good subject, the fourth nerve may be seen to give off a small recurrent branch to the dura mater (Bidder's nerve), and nearly always it will be found to form very extensive commu- nications with the fifth. The dura mater, which crosses the Casserian ganglion, may now be removed. Care must be taken to keep close to its under surface, or the fibres of the fifth will be removed with it. The three divisions of the ganglion are to be traced into the sphenoidal fissure, foramen rotundum, and foramen ovale, respectively. The nerve and ganglion may next be lifted up to display the motor root which lies underneath, and which may be distinguished by its whiter and firmer appearance. The student is recommended not to do too much dissecting at the ophthalmic division of the fifth, but to leave it until he has begun the orbit. The small meningeal artery may sometimes be seen near the inferior division, entering the skull by the foramen ovale. The sixth nerve should next be found, as it pierces the dura mater over the basilar process. The membrane over it should be cut through until the nerve is found upon the carotid artery. It should be traced forwards towards the outer wall of the sinus, until it is lost beneath the ophthalmic division of the fifth. Nothing

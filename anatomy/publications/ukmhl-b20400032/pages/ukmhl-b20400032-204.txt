Intercostal vessels and nerves. Ligaments of sternum. Dissectioii ©f ttiora.x.—Saw through the sternum just below where it is attached to the first rib, and again just above where it joins the ensiform cartilage. Cut through the muscles in the first intercostal space, as far back as the angle of the ribs. The muscles of the sixth or seventh intercostal space may be cut in the same manner, also as far back as the angle. The student must not fail to notice that by this incision he is dividing the parietal layer of the pleura as well as the muscles, and therefore cutting into the pleural cavity. The ribs, from the second to the seventh inclusive, must be cut through at their angles with a pair of strong bone forceps. The greater part of the front and side walls of the chest can then be removed in one piece. This plan of removing the whole chest wall at once will be found to offer many advantages, as it permits any foul fluid that may have accumulated in the chest to be readily drained off, and leaves the constituents of the thorax wall readily available for dissection. As a very large number of the bodies which are employed for dissection have at some time or other suffered from pleurisy, the lung and both layers of the pleura are often adherent to the chest wall. Some difficulty may therefore be experienced in its removal. If this should be the case, the lung must be

When this muscle, together with the erector clitoridis, and the small accompanying vessels, are removed, the triangular ligament is reached ; but, as has been before pointed out, so much of the space which it occupies in the male is in the female taken up by the vagina (Fig. 18), that it will not be so easy to distinguish it as in the other sex. Fa.rts seen wlaeia tlie a'B>dome9& is opened. â€”When the abdominal cavity has been opened by the incisions just described, the following structures will be seen (Fig. 14) : Bladder (if distended). Small intestines. The great omentum. Transverse colon. Lower portions of descending and ascending colon (per- haps) . Sigmoid flexure and csecum may perhaps be partially visible. Stomach. Lesser omentum, if the hver be hfted up. Liver, right and left lobes separated by falciform ligament. Gall bladder (the tip). Spleen (perhaps the edge). Eound ligament of liver. Lrachus. The actual position of the viscera must be accu- rately compared with the surface markings which have been already alluded to. (Vide page 110, and Frontis- piece.) The student will have no difficulty in verify- ing the various viscera : he can, if necessary, refer to a work on descriptive anatomy. He must remember that the abdominal viscera will have to be learnt in the following manner. First,, their actual position and relations to the body wall ; secondly, how they are maintained in their proper places, or, in other words, the reflections of the peri- toneum which attach them to the body wall; and lastly, their blood and nerve supply. In order to get an idea of the general arrangement of the peritoneum^ the student must, for the moment,

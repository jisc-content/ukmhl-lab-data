If this branch be traced downwards into the concavity of the arch of the aorta, it can generally be seen to join with another nerve, a branch of the sympathetic, which usually passes over the aortic arch ; and their junction is generally well indicated by a grey gan- glionic mass, the ganglion of Wrisberg. The sympathetic nerve should, if possible, be traced upwards, when it will be usually found to terminate in the left superior cervical ganglion. In close relationship to the arch of the aorta, and not very far, therefore, from this plexus, is the phrenic nerve, but it has no connection with the plexus. In order to display the deep or great cardiac plexus, and at the same time do as little damage as possible to the surrounding structures, the right side of the cut pericardium, together with the right side of the heart, must be gently pulled over towards the left, and there held by hooks to the table or a block. Care must be taken not to injure the aorta, which, being tightly distended by injection, may be ruptured if too much stress is put upon it. (Vide page 203.) By this manoeuvre the front of the trachea will be exposed, and the deep plexus only needs a little dis- section for its complete display. To effect this, the right vagus must be traced downwards (it has been already found, lying on the side of the trachea), and it will be readily seen to give several branches, which unite with sympathetic branches to form the plexus. There will be no diffi- culty in tracing several branches forward to the super- ficial plexus ; indeed, as has been already stated, they form in reality but one plexus. The distance to which the cardiac nerves can be traced upwards, depends in great measure upon the fresh condition of the body, and upon the extent to

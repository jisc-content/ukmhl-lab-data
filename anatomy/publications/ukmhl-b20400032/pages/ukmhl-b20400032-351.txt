The Eye. 337 Chap. XIII.] keeping it immersed in water, should push the point of a sharp knife into it about the middle of the scle- rotic. Into the aperture made with the knife^ a very fine, sharp pair of scissors may be introduced, and all the tunics of the eye cut through, and the posterior chamber opened. The vitreous should next be divided, so as to have some on the back and some on the front of the globe. On the posterior portion the dissector should see the Retina. Retinal vessels. Optic disc. Yellow spot. Tapetum (in bullock's eye). Choroid. Lamina fusca. Entrance of ciliary vessels and nerves. The retina in the living eye would be perfectly transparent, but in the eye which is being dissected will look like a layer of wet tissue paper spread over the back of the posterior chamber. The retinal vein is usually naturally injected, and is easily seen passing into the eye through the centre of the ojDtic nerve, and spreading over the retina. By a natural injection is merely meant that the vein remains full of blood. The central artery of the retina (arteria centralis retinae) enters at the same place as the vein, but being uninjected easily escapes notice. Its branches may be seen as very delicate threads running over the retina independently of the veins. External to the optic nerve the retina in the human eye presents a very small area, where it sometimes appears more opaque than else- where.* This is the yellow spot, and the student must not be surprised if he cannot see it, as it is often indistinguishable. The veins and arteries of the retina as they pass from the optic nerve divide into two great trunks, which run above and below the yellov,^ spots to the outer side of the globe. The * There is no yellow spot in bullocks' eyes. W

The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. iii. 24 are most frequently overlooked, but it is evident that unless these points are known it would be impossible to mark out the course of the artery. The axillary vein is of considerable size, and even when empty greatly overlaps the artery. It should be cleaned and pulled downwards to expose the artery. As its walls are thin, care must be taken not to open it ; the vein usually contains a quantity of blood, which escapes and obscures all the other struc- tures. When the artery and its branches have been found, the cords of the brachial plexus should be sought for above the former. The tendinous origin of the subclavian muscle, and its insertion into the clavicle, should, lastly, be made out. If it does not interfere with the dissector of the head and neck, this is a favourable opportunity to examine the sterno-clavi- cular articulation. The capsular ligament of this joint should be cleaned, and afterwards opened to display its synovial membrane, and its interarticular fibre-cartilage. I>issecti©it of ttie a^xitSa.—The arm still being extended at right angles to the trunk, the boundaries and surface markings of this important space should be made out; they are : Line of the axillary artery. Coracoid process. Head of humerus. Pectoralis major, forming an- terior boundary. Latissimus dorsi, forming pos- terior boundary. Chest wall and serrations of the Serratus magnus, forming in- ner boundary. To expose the axillary contents the following skin incisions may be made : 1. Downwards and outwards towards the arm, from the concavity of the clavicle to the place where the surface markings of the axillary artery terminate. 2. A circular incision round the arm just below the folds of the axilla. The skin flap must

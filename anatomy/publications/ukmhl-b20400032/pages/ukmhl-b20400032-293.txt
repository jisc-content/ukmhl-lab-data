Chap. IX.J Eighth and Ninth pair of Nerves. 279 The anterior surface of the rectus lateralis may be partially cleanedj care being taken not to injure the occipital artery, which lies upon its outer side. In some bodies the anterior branch of the suboccipital nerve may be found coming out at its inner edge ; if any difficulty is experienced in finding it, the student had better wait until a later stage. Nearly all the other branches of the cervical plexus have been dis- sected, but the student should consult his text-books for additional information. The hypoglossal nerve may now be traced upwards, and generally seen to blend with the vagus at a point v/here the latter displays an elongated swelling, its inferior ganglion. The hypoglossal at this point is concealed by the- internal jugular vein, internal to which it passes. To continue tracing the nerve, the internal jugular vein should be tied, about two inches from the skull, with two strings, and divided between them ; its upper end may now be pulled outwards. The hypoglossal can almost be followed into the anterior condyloid foramen, but in tracing it care must be taken not to cut away the branch of communication v/liich it receives from the first cervical loop, or the branches which it receives from the sympathetic. To preserve these communications requires considerable skill and patience, even if the body is fresh and lean. The glosso - pharyngeal nerve has already been found winding round the posterior border of the stylo- pharyngeus. It may also be traced upwards, until it appears to be lost between the internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery. A branch may be found given oflT from the glosso- pharyngeal higher up. It runs down to join the sympathetic on the internal carotid arteries. Usually this carotid branch may be traced to a small gan- glion, situated at the bifurcation of the carotids, and called the ganglion intercarotidum. Underneath the

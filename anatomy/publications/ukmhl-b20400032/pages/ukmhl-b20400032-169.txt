Chap, v.] Large Intestines. in review before removal. Its relations to the spleen, kidneys, liver, and duodenum, are of special impor- tance. Afterwards it may be removed, just as the small intestine was, by cutting through the peritoneum close to it, taking care to avoid cutting off the vermiform appendix of the caecum. Where the intestine passes over the left side of the brim of the pelvis to become the rectum, it must be tied across in two places, an inch apart, and severed in between them. When it is removed it is better to examine it at once. The large intestine should be cut across two or three inches above the csecum, and the end of the ileum with the caecum washed out under the tap. The c^cum should be blown up and its ends tied. It may then be left to dry, so as to display the ilio- csecal valve. If a fresh specimen of the valve be examined, it will be found that if the longitudinal fibres at the junction of the large and small intestines be divided a little traction will serve to obliterate the valve, which is merely an infolding of the mucous membrane, containing a few circular muscular fibres. In the dry specimen the two cusps of the valve will be well seen, the superior one being horizontal, and the inferior vertical in direction. Before the ascending colon is slit up for the purpose of examination, it must be carefully washed at the tap. It will be found to differ from the small intestine in being larger and thicker. It is traversed by three longitudinal bands of muscular fibres, w^hich, being shorter than the gut itself, cause it to pouch out, and it has attached to it some tags of fat, called appendices epiploicae, which have been already noticed during the examination of the peritoneum.

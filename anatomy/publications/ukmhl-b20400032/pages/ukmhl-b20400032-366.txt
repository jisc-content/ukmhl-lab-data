No difficulty should now be experienced in pushing the handle of the knife very gently into the ventricle in different directions. The white matter forming the centrum ovale should be lifted up, and removed in such a manner as to lay bare the anterior and pos- terior horns of the ventricle, but still leave a strip of corpus callosum, about three-quarters of an inch wide, in the middle line. Especial care must be taken near the splenium not to injure the posterior pillars of the fornix. The sharp, tape-like edges of this structure are seen diverging at each side from beneath the posterior end of the corpus callosum. The structures seen in the lateral ventricles are: Velum interpositum and choroid plexus. Posterior pillars of the fornix. Optic thalamus. Corpus striatum. Taenia semicircular] s. Anterior, middle, and pos- terior horns. Calcar, or hippocampus minor, in posterior horn. Eminentia collaterahs, be- tween middle and pos- terior horns. 'Choroid plexus. Taenia hippocampi (also S called corpus fimbria- ^ tum, or processus fim- ^ J briatus, or posterior ^ pillar of the fornix), 'g Hippocampus major. 2 Pes hippocampi. Eminentia collateralis (sometimes). All the structures within the bracket are in the descending horn of the lateral ventricle. The choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles are situated upon the outer edge of a layer of pia mater (velum interpositum). The student will remember that he lifted up the splenium in order to see the pia mater enter the interior of the brain beneath it. As soon as the pia mater has got beneath the corpus callosum it spreads out like a fan. The front and outer margin of this fan is thickened and villous, and forms the

Not less than a pint and a half of methylated spirit should be poured over the brain, and the jar carefully covered to prevent evaporation. =^ In about five days the brain should be examinedj turned over, and fresh strong (60 over proof) spirits added. In about four- teen days the brain is ready for use, or it may be kept until required. The way in which it has to be dissected will be described afterwards. Many other methods of hardening brains are in use. Nitric acid is a cheap and efficient hardener. If this method be employed, some strong nitric acid should be mixed with water in the proportion of 1 to 12, and the brain left in the solution for about a week. Afterwards the brain should be taken out of the acid, and kept in weak spirit and water. If left too long in the acid the brain shrinks, and becomes so hard that the most important parts cannot be made out. Before proceed- ing with the interior of the skull, the face and neck should be covered with a damp cloth and a layer of guttapercha tissue. CHAPTER IX. DISSECTION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE SKULL AFTER THE BRAIN HAS BEEN REMOVED. This comprises the sinuses, arteries, and nerves. The falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli should be stretched in position, in order to see the relation they have to the skull. When this has been done, the follow- ing sinuses require to be examined. The student is * If a hydrometer be employed, the exact strength should be 10 to 15 over proof.

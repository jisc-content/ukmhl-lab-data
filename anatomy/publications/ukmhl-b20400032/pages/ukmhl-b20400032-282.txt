268 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. carotid should now be cleaned, and the dissection of the internal jugular vein continued. The pneumo- gastric nerve has the same relation to the internal carotid artery and jugular vein which it used to have to the common carotid and internal jugular vein. By searching amongst the connective tissue near the internal laryngeal artery, a small nerve can be found entering the larynx through the same aperture in the thyro-hyoid membrane. This is the internal laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. Another branch of the su])erior laryngeal nerve, the external laryngeal, may be found accompanying the crico- thyroid artery. It will be found more convenient to do nothing further at the superior carotid triangle at present, but to wait until a later stage, when the structures seen in it can be traced in their continuity. The submaxillary or dig-astric triaiigie.â€” The lower jaw should be pulled strongly up with hooks, and the head thrown backwards. When this is done, and when the platysma has been removed, the submaxillary gland may be seen beneath the jaw, concealed by the deep cervical fascia. The fascia may be removed from the gland and remainder of the submaxillary region. The knife should be carefully applied close to the submaxillary gland, and dipped in between its lobules, so as to define them. The student will observe how much coarser they are than the lobules of the parotid. When the gland has been fairly well freed from the surrounding fascia, it should be lifted gently, and hooked up towards the face. This brings the two bellies of the digastric muscle into better view. The boundaries of the submaxillary triangle should now be defined. In cleaning the posterior belly of the digas- tricus, its tendons will be seen to pass through the fibres of the stylo-hyoid muscle, just before the latter is inserted into the hyoid bone. Next, the anterior

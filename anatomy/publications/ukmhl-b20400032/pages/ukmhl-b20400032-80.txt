66 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. iv. connective tissue which surrounds it must be carefully dissected off. About an inch below the apex of Scarpa's triangle some dense white fibres, transverse in direction, and quite different from its mere con- nective-tissue covering higher up, will be seen running across the artery from the vastus internus to the adductors. If these are carefully cleaned, they will be found to extend down the thigh some four or five inches. Their lower edge is usually well marked, and from under them at this point a nerve (the long saphenous) will be seen emerging, and should be traced onwards to where it runs alongside of the internal saphenous vein. Just at the lower end of Hunter^s canal a branch of the saphenous nerve can be traced, if the dissector is careful, running to join with a small one from the obturator nerve, and likewise with a branch from the internal cutaneous nerve, to form a small plexus, which has received the name of the obturator plexus. Hunter's canal.â€”The fibres which have just been described will be seen to extend from the vastus internus to the adductor longus, which is already cleaned, and also to a muscle lying under it, the adductor magnus, which is not yet cleaned. They form the roof of Hunter's canal, and if they are carefully divided, the saphena nerve will be first brought into view, then the femoral artery, and behind and to the outer wall the femoral vein. Hunter's canal will be seen to be, roughly speaking, triangular in shape, and bounded externally by the vastus internus, internally by the adductor magnus and longus, and to be roofed in by the fascia, which has just been described. At its lower end the femoral artery and vein disappear from view on the front of the leg, as they perforate the adductor magnus, and henceforth become the popliteal.

148 The Dissector's Manual. [Chnp. v. in the middle line of the parietal peritoneum. Its continuity must then be traced towards the left side with the fingers, when it will be found to pass under the ribs, over the kidney (vide Fig. 21, page 147), and then leave the abdominal wall to pass to the spleen, which it invests on its outer side completely, and to a less extent on its inner. It subsequently passes over the front of the stomach to reach the foramen of Winslow. The student will understand better the course of the peritoneum in this section if he will bear in mind that just as the intestines are moored to the back wall of the abdomen by a mesentery, so the stomach was once moored by a mesogastrium (stomach mesentery), in which the spleen is developed ; so that in reality the peritoneum has now been traced from the kidney up the left wall of the mesogastrium. It next descends the right wall of the mesogastrium, which is so lengthened by the turn the stomach has taken to the right as to be scarcely recognisable. In other words, it enters the foramen of Winslow, passes behind the stomach to the hilus of the spleen, returns over the front of the vertebral column covering the aorta and vena cava, emerges again from the foramen of Winslow, and, passing over the right kidney, ascends once more to the parietal layer in front. In order to demonstrate the size, shape, and rela- tions of the lesser peritoneal cavity, the student mast push his finger into the foramen of Winslow and downwards, till he reaches the lower border of the stomach, taking care not to break through the peri- toneum anywhere. This is a very necessary caution, as inflammation has sometimes caused abnormal adhe- sions of the peritoneum to take place, so preventing the folds from being made out. When the student's finger reaches the lower border of the stomach, he will see it through the great omentum, which must then be cut with a pair of

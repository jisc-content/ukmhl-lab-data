371 CHAPTER XVI. DISSECTING QUESTIONS. It is the custom, especially in the higher anato- mical examinations, to ask what are called dissecting questions, i.e., what is the dissection necessary to expose some definite structure, such as, for example, the supinator brevis, etc. It is commonly imagined by the student that these questions are of such a nature that they can only be answered by one who has an enormous experience of anatomy, and involve considerably more knowledge than that which is ordinarily acquired in a dissecting- room. Nothing could be more erroneous. They are only the necessary outcome of a knowledge of rela- tions which have been so often referred to in the preceding pages. The student who has succeeded in imprinting on his mind the exact relative position of the structures which he has dissected, will have no difficulty in answering a dissecting question ; whilst he who has studied the mere distribution of an artery or nerve, without accurately learning its relations to the surface or its surroundings, will be quite at sea with such a question. For this reason they are excellent tests of whether anatomy has been studied practically, and show at once whether the student can mentally visualise the composition of the body to himself, as if it were a transparent picture. When once the student has dissected his part, or, better still, the whole body, he must study it from a new stand]joint. By dissection he has studied it by the process of analysis (the separation of its component

12 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. ii. (2) Always to turn the knife upon the back of the blade. (3) Always to hold the knife absolutely flat upon the strop. It is usual to compare the edge of a knife to a fine saw. By observing the first rule, the serrations will slant towards the point. As in cutting the blade is to be drawn from point to heel, it will cut more smoothly if set in this way. The meaning of the second rule is obvious, but students so frequently break it that it seems necessary to emphasise it. The third rule is continually being broken. The blade of a knife, if seen in section, should form a perfect wedge (Fig. 2.) To preserve this wedge-shape it is evidently imperative that the knife be held flat upon the strop. It is quite true that at first it can be made very sharp by holding it at an angle to the strop (Fig. 3) ; but after awhile the consequences of this become apparent, for the perfect wedge-shape is completely destroyed, and the knife requires to be ground (Fig. 4). When a knife has been properly sharpened, it should never be laid down upon a table, but at once placed in its box. Knives laid upon the table are in great danger of being knocked off and their points destroyed. To use a knife for dissecting purposes, it should be held like a pen. The point should be used to find the smaller structures, and not to cut with. Cutting should only be done with the convexity of the blade. The point of a knife is generally blunt, and is always the hardest part to sharpen. Forceps should be chosen of a fair size (Fig. 5). The blades are to be held between the index and nuddle fingers and the thumb of the left hand: they should tlierefore be at least half an inch wide. The forceps should have just sufficient spring to cause them to open themselves when relieved from pressure. If

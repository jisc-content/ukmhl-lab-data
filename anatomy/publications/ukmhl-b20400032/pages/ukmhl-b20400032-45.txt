Chap. III.] Dissection OF the Arm, 31 down. The next two nerves, the internal cuta- neous and the external cutaneous (from musculo- cutaneous), exactly correspond. They both come out of the deep fascia about the middle of the arm, the internal cutaneous at the place where the basilic vein pierces it, the external cutaneous a little lower down. Soon after piercing the fascia, each nerve divides into an anterior branch running down the fore-arm to the wrist, and a posterior which winds round to the back of the arm, just below the condyles, and descends to the wrist. It will be seen that three internal cutaneous and three external cutaneous branches have been enumerated. Later on, their dissection may be completed. The deep fascia of the arm should be removed, and the brachial artery and veins cleaned. The student should apply the same rule to the brachial artery as he applied to the axillary, viz., to learn its beginning and end, course, relations, and branches. This rule holds good for every artery and large vein or nerve. The origin of the superior and inferior profunda, and anastomotica magna arteries should be made out, but they should only be traced as far as the inner side of the arm. Each cord of the brachial plexus should be taken in its turn, and its branches traced, as far as can be conveniently done, without moving the arm. As far as the smaller arteries of the arm are concerned, it may be remarked that most of them run with the larger nerves. As soon as the arteries, veins, and nerves have been seen, the muscles may be taken in their turn and cleaned. The greater part of the deltoid may be dissected at this stage ; the biceps, coraco- brachialis, brachialis anticus, and inner head of triceps, should be cleaned as far as the lowest skin incision.

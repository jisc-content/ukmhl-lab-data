Supraspinous. (5) Ligaments of transverse processes : Intertransverse. The anterior common ligament and the external surfaces of the intervertebral fibro-cartilages should be cleaned in a similar way to the rib ligaments. In cleaning these ligaments, numerous veins require to be removed, but in dissecting-room parts the veins are in such a condition that they cannot be cleaned. They should be studied upon a museum specimen. After- wards, the interspinous and intertransverse, and the external surfaces of the capsular ligaments, may be displayed. In the lumbar regions the ligamenta sub- flava can be partially seen outside, but to see them in the dorsal region (where they are well marked) it is necessary to remove the whole of one side of the back of the vertebral canal. By cutting through the lamina and the pedicle, and removing the spinal cord and its membranes, they can be examined from the interior. Before endeavouring to see the ligamenta subflava, the posterior occipito-atloid and atlo-axoid ligaments should be cleaned. The structures which pierce them have already been seen. (Fi(iepage 289.) The ligaments which unite the vertebral column and pelvis may be seen to be exactly the same as are found in other regions of the spine. The only diflerence is that the intertransverse ligament descends to the sacrum, and is called the lumbo-sacral, and that a ligament passes from the tip of the transverse process to the crest of

74 I'he Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iv. fibula, and about midway also between the knee and ankle, a good-sized nerve will be seen, if search is made, in the subcutaneous tissue. This is the musculo- cutaneous, which divides usually into two branches before it reaches the front of the ankle. Besides these nerves, there may be numerous small unnamed arteries supplying the skin and subcutaneous tissue. When these structures have been discovered, the subcutaneous tissue should be carefully cleaned off the leg, and the deep fascia with the subcutaneous portions of the bones covered by periosteum will be exposed. The deep fascia is a thick dense membrane, and will be seen to be attached above and on either side to the tibia and fibula, gradually thinning as it descends; when it reaches the front of the ankle it suddenly forms a thickened band (the anterior annular ligament), which runs across from one malleolus to the other. The whole of this deep fascia must be carefully dissected off the subjacent muscles, which are very firmly attached to it, taking care not to cut away the internal saphenous nerve and vein and the musculo- cutaneous nerve. In order to avoid the latter, it is perhaps best to begin at the outer border of the sub- cutaneous surface of the tibia, and making an incision just through the fascia, seize the cut edge with forceps, and carefully clean the muscle underneath (tibialis anticus) in the direction of its fibres. When the outer edge of this muscle is reached, the fascia will be found to dip downwards, showing that it forms, as has been often before stated, a distinct skin for the muscle. As the upper part of the tibialis anticus is reached, it will be found much more difficult to clean the fascia from the muscle, as some of its fibres actually take origin from the fascia. The remaining muscles which pass in front of the ankle-joint must be cleaned exactly in the same

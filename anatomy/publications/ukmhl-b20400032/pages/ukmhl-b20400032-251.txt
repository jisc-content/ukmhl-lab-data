The Orbit. 237 Chap. IX.] are to be sought for in the following positions: The infratrochlear, as the nerve passes between the superior oblique and internal rectus ; the long ciliary, as it crosses the optic nerve; and the long root of the ganglion, as it enters the sphenoidal fissure. It has already been remarked that they may be found by following the anterior border of the nerve j this had better be done from behind forwards. When the long root of the ciliary ganglion has been found, it should be traced forward by taking hold of it very gently and scratching along its course very carefully with the point of the knife. Soon a small reddish mass comes into view close to the outer side of the optic nerve. This is the lenticular or ciliary ganglion. In front, the very slender short ciliary nerves emerge from it, and can be traced to the sclerotic. By lift- ing up the ganglion very gently with the forceps, its short root appears, and may be traced down to the inferior division of the third nerve, which may now be exposed. To find the superior division of the third nerve, the superior rectus and levator palpebrse are to be turned over towards the inner side of the orbit, and the nerve looked for in close contact with their ocular surface. The inferior division has already been found lying deep in the orbit, and may be followed backwards and forwards. The sixth nerve remains to be examined, and is to be found closely applied to the internal surface of the external rectus. If the superior attachment of the external rectus be placed in position again, it will be observed that the two divisions of the third, the nasal and sixth nerves, and ophthalmic vein, appear to pass between its upper and lower attachments, or heads, as they are called. By this time the main trunk of the ophthalmic vein will have been exposed. It generally contains a little blood, which enables it to be recognised. It should be dissected from the sphenoidal fissure over the

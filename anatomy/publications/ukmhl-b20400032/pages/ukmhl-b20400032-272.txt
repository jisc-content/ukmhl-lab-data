258 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. subclavian triangle. The following structures have to be made out in the upper triangle: Muscles bounding it. Its floor formed by Splenius. Levator anguli scapulae. Scalenus medius and posti- cus. Transversalis colU artery. External jugular vein. Posterior jugular vein. Transversalis colli vein. Branches of cervical plexus. Lymphatic glands. Spmal accessory nerve. It will be found convenient to clean the veins first, and they should be traced one by one towards the inner end of the clavicle, where they all converge to enter the subclavian. The nerves are chiefly branches of the cervical plexus, which is situated beneath the upper part of the sterno-mastoid muscle. The nerves will, by carefully dissecting along the posterior margin, be seen emerging from beneath the muscle ; and when one has been found, it will serve as a guide to the others, which may be traced upwards, downwards, and across to the front of the neck. The spinal accessory nerve may be distinguished from the other nerves running downwards and out- wards, by lifting the sterno-mastoid up, so as to see it emerging from its fibres, or it may be traced into the trapezius below. The small nerve which supplies the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid is very frequently cut away in removing the fascia from the muscle. It should be looked for running close to the upper border of the posterior belly. The only artery contained in this space is the transversalis colli. This vessel arises from the thyroid axis, a branch of the first part of the subcl^ivian, beneath the lower part of the sterno- mastoid. It emerges from beneath this muscle, and passes under the omo-hyoid, amidst a quantity of fat and cellular tissue, to divide beneath the lower part of the anterior edge of the trapezius in its terminal branches. The artery should be searched for by

2IO The Dissector^s Manual. [Ciiap. vi. By tlie assistance of the dissector of the abdomen, the relations of the oesophagus and stomach through- out their whole extent should be carefully re-studied, and the vagi traced to their destinations on the back and front of the stomach. The student will not fail to notice that the oesophagus pierces the diaphragm at the level of the ninth dorsal vertebra, almost an inch to the left of the middle line of the body. The aortic opening will now need to be laid open in a similar fashion. It is seen to be lower down, as the aorta emerges into the abdomen, between the crura of the diaphragm at about the level of the twelfth dorsal vertebra. The thoracic duct, vena azygos major, and some- times the left sympathetic nerve, will be seen to traverse the same aperture, and must be traced onward to their destinations. {Vide Dissection of ab- domen, page 172.) The right and left crura of the diaphragm must be cut away, so as to trace onward the splanchnic nerves, and vena azygos minor, into the abdomen. N.B.â€”During the dissection of the diaphragm the phrenic nerves can usually be traced through it, that on the right side communicating with a small ganglion derived from the solar plexus, which is called the ganglion diaphragmaticum. The upper aperture of tlie tliorax must now be carefully studied, so as to make out what are the relations of the structures that enter it from the head and neck. It is doubly necessary to draw attention to this, for, as it is difficult to say whether it belongs to the head and neck or to the thorax, it is in con- siderable danger of being neglected altogether. The best way to learn the contents of the upper aperture is to bear in mind that the contents of the thorax extend upwards for some little distance above the edges of the bony opening.

Sympa the tic Sys tem. 169 Chap, v.] branches can be dissected which run over the brim of the pelvis to a plexus between the iliac arteries, called the hypogastric, which will be dissected later on. Just below the crura of the diaphragm, and behind the renal vessels, the main sympathetic chain, with a ganglion corresponding with each vertebra, should be traced to the brim of the pelvis. From these ganglia branches can be traced forwards to interlace with all the nerves in their proximity, When the branches of the sympathetic system have been niade out, the rest of the peritoneum and areolar tissue, which envelop the vena cava, aorta, kidneys, and back of abdomen, will need to be removed. There is, as a rule, no difficulty in this; the structures have long before had their situations indicated, so it only remains to clean them, and to make out the branches and relations of the aorta and vena cava, and the situation and relations of the kidneys. When stripping the connective tissue off the muscles at the back of the abdominal cavity, care must be taken to avoid injuring the branches of the lumbar plexus which lie on them. The nerve most likely to be injured is the genito-crural, which emerges from the psoas on its inner and front surface, and which lower down lies on the external iliac-artery. The common and external iliac artery and vein must be carefully cleaned and their relations studied, but the internal iliac artery and vein, along with the other structures in the pelvis, must be left to be dissected with the side view of the pelvis. At the top of the kidney, resting on it like a cap, is a small body from one to two inches across (the suprarenal capsule), which has already been men- tioned by anticipation, when numerous branches from the solar plexus were traced to it, upon the arteries

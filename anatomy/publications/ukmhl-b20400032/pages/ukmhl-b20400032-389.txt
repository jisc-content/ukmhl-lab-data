Chap. XVI.] Dissecting Questions. 375 of the knee-joint, and the popliteus muscle and its tendon, which is within the joint, will be exposed. To show it perfectly the expansion of the semi- membranosus which covers the muscles must be cut away, and the popliteal vessels and nerves cut across. Probably in actual dissection this would not be done, unless the student was specially asked to clear every- thing^ from the surface of the muscle. There would be exposed, in addition, the nerve to the popliteus, coming off from the popliteal high up and running over the surface of the muscle to curl round its lower border, which abuts on the soleus. Some articular arteries, veins, and nerves from the popliteal vessels and nerves will be seen running along its borders. A few more particulars about the relative position of the parts as they were exposed in order, and every- thing would have been described that possibly could have been expected from the most advanced of students. Supposing even that a few of the smaller structures had been omitted, the answer would still have been well planned, and have shown a thorough rational knowledge of anatomy, and would therefore ensure favourable attention. Supposing, however, that the popliteal artery had been described as running outside the gastrocnemius, or the popliteus muscle had not been described as in relationship with the biceps tendon ; or, supposing it was evident from his answer that the student did not know that the tendon of the muscle perforated the capsular ligament, then the answer would count but little, even though many unimportant minutiae had been cliurned up with it. Repeated handling of parts in the dissecting-room is a sure safeguard against all such errors, and is the shortest and easiest way to learn anatomy, if only the student would believe it.

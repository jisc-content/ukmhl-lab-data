They should be roughly removed from behind by scraping the dura mater with the handle of the knife. Afterwards, with the scissors the dura mater should be divided throughout its whole length in the middle line, and its edges spread wide open, and fastened to the bones with pins. The parts which require examination are the Arachnoid and sabarachnoid Cauda equina. space. Filum terminale. Spinal arteries. Ligamenta dentata. Spinal cord. Spinal accessory nerve. Boots of nerves. The inner surface of the dura mater is smooth, because it is covered with a layer of endothelial cells, which constitute what used to be called the parietal layer of the arachnoid. This must be considered as really part of the dura mater, as it has no connection with the membrane next seen. The arachnoid (for- merly spoken of as the visceral layer of the arachnoid) is very delicate, and makes a sac for the spinal cord and for the anterior and posterior nerve roots. This sac is far too large for its contents, and is applied close to the parietal layer. A very considerable space is therefore left between the arachnoid (visceral layer) and the surface of the cord, covered by pia mater. This space is the subarachnoid space, and it is crossed by the nerve roots and ligamenta dentata, both of which pierce the arachnoid. Towards the lumbar region the arachnoid can easily be seized with the forceps, and its thinness and looseness seen. (Vide Fig. 47.) The spinal cord, continuous above with the medulla, ends below (in the adult) about the second lumbar vertebra. The roots of the spinal nerves emerge from the sides of the cord, run across the subarachnoid space, and pierce the dura mater

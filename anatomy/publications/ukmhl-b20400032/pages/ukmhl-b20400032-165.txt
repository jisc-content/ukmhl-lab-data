I>issecti©ii of small intestines below duo- de 1111 Ml.—That portion of the small intestine which has a mesentery, and may therefore be said to move on a universal joint, should first be removed, as it is easily learnt, and is liable to get in the way. As it is all supplied by the superior mesenteric artery and vein, and by nerves which accompany them ; and as the blood and nerve-supply of each part of the small intestine is similar in arrangement, it is only necessary to select any six inches and dissect them carefully to understand the arrangement throughout the remaining part. Any six inches may be selected with the cor- responding mesentery. The injected vessels will probably be seen through the mesentery, unless it is very fat. The layer of mesentery which overlies the vessels should be seized with the forceps, cut through, and carefully stripped off, so as to clean the arteries and veins. Close beside them, if the body is a fairly good one, will be seen some fine greyish-white fibrils, which are the nerves. When once found, the vessels can be easily traced up to the main trunk of the superior mesenteric, by cutting through the inferior

i'B2 The Dlssectoe"s Manual. [Chap. v bladder. The student should notice that the air with which he inflated the bladder rarely if ever escapes by the ureter. This is owing to the fact that the ureter enters the bladder obliquely, and so has a sort of valved orifice, which prevents regurgitation. It can readily be seen when the bladder is open, by passing a probe down the ureter, and cutting down upon its course. Passing onwards, under the base of the bladder, the student will readily feel some firmer masses (vesi- culse seminales), but will not see them till they have been carefully dissected, as they are covered with a very dense fascia, which is continued inwards from the recto-vesical. They should be cleaned, and the vasa deferentia followed until they join the ducts of the vesiculse. By following these structures onwards under the base of the bladder, after it has been pulled to the right side, the prostate will be reached, and should be completely exposed on its left side by dividing the upper part of the lateral true ligament of the bladder. The trunk of the internal iliac artery, where it was divided, should be fixed, and the vessel and its branches, as well as those of the artery of the opposite side, carefully cleaned. There will be no diificulty in tracing the three vesical arteries which come from them. The upper becomes continuous with the ob- literated hypogastric, which has already been seen; the middle supplies the lower part of the bladder and vesiculse seminales; the inferior vesical, now that the lateral true ligament of the bladder has been cut away, can be traced to the prostate and neck of the bladder. The middle liiemorrhoidal branch should be traced on to the rectum. On the right side the obturator artery is seen lying on the obturator fascia, and must be traced to where it leaves the pelvis at the obturator foramen, a small

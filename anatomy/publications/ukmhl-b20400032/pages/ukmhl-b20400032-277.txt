Chap. IX.] Inferior Carotid Triangle, 263 amongst the muscles beneath the jaw. Tlie main trunk of the vein should be cleaned and traced upwards, and afterwards downwards beneath the sterno-mastoid to its termination in the external jugular or subclavian veins. It may be remarked that the appearance of these veins on the dead body in their collapsed state gives hardly any idea of their size and importance during life. To expose the inferior carotid triangles the deep fascia should be removed. If a commencement be made at the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and the fascia dissected forward, it may be seen to pass both in front and behind the depressor muscles of the hyoid bone. (Vide Fig. 37, page 256.) These muscles lie near the middle line, and form part of the floor of the triangle. Care must be taken in cleaning them not to cut through their nerve-supply, which comes from the descendens noni and enters their posterior external borders. Although not all actually in the inferior carotid triangles, the following structures may be enumerated as their contents : Sterno-hyOld, and Sterno-thyroid muscles. Common carotid artery, "J ^ Internal jugular vein, [â€¢ .si Pneumo-gas trie nerve, ) ^ Sympathetic nerve. Descendens and communi- cantes noni nerves, join- ing to form the ansa- hypoglossi. Inferior thyroid artery and vein. Trachea. Larynx. Recurrent laryngeal nerves. CEsophagus on left side. Thyroid gland. Glandulae concatenatse. The coverings of the triangles and their superficial nerves and veins have been already mentioned. The importance which belongs to this triangle is due to the fact that it contains the trachea and common carotid artery, and, it may be added, the oesophagus, on the left side. These structures are not infrequently involved in surgical procedures, and therefore their

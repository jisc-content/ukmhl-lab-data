79 Ckap. IV.] The Dorsum of the Foot, malleolus, the lower to the scaphoid bone and fascia at the inner side of the foot. When this is completed, the deep fascia must be removed from the dorsum of the foot, beginning on one side, and taking it carefully off towards the other. Its removal will expose a further portion of the tendons belonging to the muscles of the front of the leg, which should be continued to their insertions. At the same time a small muscle (the extensor brevis digitorum) will be seen arising from the upper surface of the os calcis, and passing onwards to be inserted into the fibular side of the first phalanx of the great toe, and into the three next extensor tendons. When the muscle and the extensor tendons are completely cleaned, the dorsalis pedis artery, which is the continuation of the anterior tibial, will be seen to run on a deeper plane. It is first seen coming from under the annular ligament, between the extensor longus digitorum and extensor proprius poUicis, and if any difiiculty is experienced in finding, it can be readily made out by pulling on the anterior tibial. When once it has been found, it can be traced to the first cleft, where it descends to join the deep plantar arch, which will be seen when the sole is dissected. Outside the anterior tibial artery will be found the corresponding nerve, which divides into a super- ficial and a deep branch. The deep branch should be traced into the extensor brevis digitorum, the super- ficial into the first cleft. There will be no di;fficulty in tracing branches from the dorsalis pedis artery across the tarsal and metatarsal bones, and making out the digital branches if they are injected; if not, a little more care is necessary to trace them; but the student must remember that they all lie on a deeper plane to the tendons and extensor brevis digitorum.

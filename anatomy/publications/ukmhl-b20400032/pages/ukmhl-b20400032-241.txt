Chap. VIII.] Hardening the Brain. 227 circle of Willis (-whicli is tiie circle at tlie base of the brain formed by the carotid and vertebral arteries) and the great trunks which go from it to the brain. It is therefore desirable to learn these first. Place the brain, base upwards, upon a clean board, and wind a cloth round it in such a way as to prevent it collapsing. The circle of Willis will be found between the two protruding lobes called temporo-sphenoidal. When these lobes are pulled on one side the arteries still remain concealed by the arachnoid, which in this situation is very loose. With two pairs of forceps the membrane should be pulled away, and the lobes of the brain gently separated with the tips of the fingers, in order to display the great trunks as they pass from the circle. As this is done, more arachnoid will require to be removed, and when the arteries have been properly displayed and learnt, the student may begin to remove the pia mater. In doing this the two pairs of forceps come into requisition again, and the greatest care must be taken not to drag the nerves away from their attachments to the brain. If the arteries or veins threaten to lacerate the convolutions when they are being removed, divide them with scissors. Do not omit to note that the pia mater dips down in between the convolutions. When the under surface has been cleaned, carefully turn the brain over and complete the vertex. Take care to draw the pia mater out of the sulci, and pass the handle of the knife between the posterior extremity of the corpus callosum, in order to admit the hardening solution into the interior. The corpus callosum is the great transverse commissure or con- nection which unites the two halves of the brain, and may easily be seen by slightly separating the two halves. Some soft clean tow having been obtained, a nest should be made for the brain in a suitable earthen

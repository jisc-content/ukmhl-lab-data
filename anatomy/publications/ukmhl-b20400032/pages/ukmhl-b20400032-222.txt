208 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. vi. given off as two separate branches direct from the aorta. The student will not fail to note that, owing to the oblique direction of the transverse part of the aortic arch, the subclavian lies almost directly behind the carotid. It should be observed that the great trunks which arise from the aorta are crossed by the left innominate vein, and that the innominate artery crosses the trachea obliquely. There is a small nerve on the innominate artery (cardiac branch of vagus). Winding round the subclavian artery of the right side, the right recurrent laryngeal nerve will be found. In the roots of the lungs, which should now be completed, will be found the bronchial arteries (nutrient arteries of the lung), which are various in origin, and may be traced back either to the aorta or to an aortic intercostal. The relationship of the pulmonary vein and artery, and of the bronchus from above downwards, and from before backwards in the roots of the lungs, will next be made out, and committed to memory. During the course of the dissection of the middle and posterior mediastina it is impossible that the veins should not have been touched. There will, therefore, probably be little need for dissection to display the vena cava superior^ with its tributaries the two innominate veins. The relations of all these veins must be studied, and the small branches which enter them made out, and verified from some text- book of descriptive anatomy. When all the various structures in the thorax have been once more gone over by the student, so as to ascertain that he knows them, the heart, with the ])ericardium, should be removed from the chest, by cutting through the various vessels just outside the heart, and removing that part of the diaphragm to which the pericardium is attached. By stuffing the pericardium with tow, and sewing

35^ The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. xiv. continued round each cms cerebri as far as the end of the descending horn of the lateral ventricle. In order to see this, the posterior pillar of the fornix should be raised with the handle of the knife, and the posterior portion of the brain, includiDg the temporo-sphenoidal lobe and hippocampus major, gradually pulled away laterally from the optic thalamus which remains upon the anterior portion. It will then be seen that the only part of the brain which is lacerated when this is done is a small portion close to the end of the descending horn, and just internal to the crochet. Small choroidal arteries can easily b 3 seen entering the ventricle through the transverse fissure, and it will be remembered that as they entered they notched the corpus fimbriatum and the grey matter. Before removing the velum interpositum, it should be followed forwards as far as the anterior pillars of the fornix, at which point the choroidal plexuses of opposite sides will be seen to communicate. The notch between the optic thalamus and corpus striatum is bridged over by the fornix, so as to form a sort of foramen, through which the choroid plexuses pass (foramen of Monro). The velum interpositum may now be raised from behind and removed, together with the choroid plexuses. In doing this, care must be taken not to pull the pineal body away with it. This small body is firmly fastened to its under surface, but should be left attached to the brain, just above the corpora quadrigemina. When the velum inter- positum is taken away, the following structures are to be examined : Third ventricle. Anterior pillars of fornix and septum lucidum. Fifth, ventricle. Anterior, middle, and posterior commissures. Pineal body. Aqueduct of Sylvius. Superior peduncles of cere- bellum. Yalve of Vieussens. Fourth nerves. Optic nerves and corpora geniculata.

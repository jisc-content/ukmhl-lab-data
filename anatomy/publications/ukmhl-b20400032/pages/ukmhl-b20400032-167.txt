Chap, v.] 153 Small Intestines. make a smell if left lying about, and often never gei> dissected at all. They should be held under the tap, and their contents washed out, after which they can be slit open along the attachment of the mesentery with a pair of scissors, and floated out in water. On the inside of both, if they are fairly fresh, some velvety projections will be seen, which float up in the water. These are the villi. In the upper part of the intestine the mucous coat is thrown into well- marked folds called valvulse conniventes. In the portion of intestine which abuts on the caecum, there will be seen on the opposite border to that occupied by the mesentery some greyish-looking masses, about the size of a kidney bean or smaller^ with pits in them about the size of a pin's head. These are Peyer's patches. The student should particularly note the difference between the jejunum and ileum. The jejunum is very much thicker, contains abundant valvulse conniventes, and no Peyer's patches, whilst the ileum is thinner, contains very few if any valvulse conniventes, and about two dozen Peyer's patches. Solitary glands are found all along the whole length of the small intestine. They consist of small pits about the size of a pin's head, and are sometimes like little craters in the centre of a raised patch. If the mucous membrane be rubbed off* with the thumb and finger as it lies in the water, the subjacent muscular coats will be exposed. If the intestine is very fresh, it will be necessary to dissect off' the mucous coat. The student will then be able to make out, if he hold the piece of intestine up to the light, that the fibres on the inside run circularly, whilst those outside have a longitudinal direction. The outer ones are covered by the smooth peritoneal coat, which can be

Too often when a student has dissected a part he thinks he has done all that is requisite. But now comes the battle, he must learn it. He has learnt from his dissecting book how to expose the structures to best advantage, just as he learns from his guide book when he goes abroad what is best worth seeing. But if his knowledge of anatomy is to advance a step farther, he must study it with a work on descriptive anatomy; just as he studies a country whose history he would learn, with a systematic history. Forceps in hand, and descriptive anatomy before him, the part must be diligently gone over and learnt, and looked at, first in one position, then in another, till he knows it. Anatomy must be learnt in the dissecting-room. It is by no means intended that the student should look at no one else's part, but it should only be to supplement the deficiencies of his own, or to compare with others', and test the knowledge he has obtained. The more Voften he shows and explains his own part to others, the more he will learn about it himself. By learning his part is meant knowing the distri- bution, relations, and branches of its nerves, veins, arteries, etc., and the origin, insertion, and relations and actions of its muscles. By the origin of a muscle, is meant that portion of it which remains fixed when it contracts ; by its insertion, the end which moves towards the fixed portion. In the case of some muscles, either end may be fixed, in accordance with what particular action they are performing; if this is the case, either end may have the name of origin, but custom has usually given this name to one or other exclusively.

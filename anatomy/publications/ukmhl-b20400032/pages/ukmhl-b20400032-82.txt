68 The Dissector's Manual. [Cbap. iv. If the student has not already done so, he must now dissect carefully between the tensor vaginae feraoris and the sartorius, keeping quite close to the former muscle. He must then pull the tensor fem- oris a little away from the leg, and cut it away from its origin, leaving none of it attached to the outside of the ilium. When this is finished, the connective tissue and fat must be carefully dissected from the outside of the vastus externus, and the place where it comes forward to take origin from the front surface of the femur clearly defined. When the tensor fasciae femoris is cut away, its nerve (a branch of the superior gluteal) will be found coming forward between the gluteus medius and minimus, and must be taken care of, as it has to be dissected with the muscles of the gluteal region. At present it serves to indicate the separation between the gluteus medius and minimus. Next trace the rectus up to its origin; both its heads can be easily dissected now that the tensor fasciae femoris is cut away. It has already been mentioned (in the dissection of Scarpa's triangle) that the external circumflex artery courses between the branches of the anterior crural nerve. It must now be traced outwards. To do so, the sartorius must be pulled with hooks, if necessary, to the inner side of the leg, and the fascia cleaned from underneath the rectus, care being taken not to cut away the branch of the anterior crural nerve, which enters its under surface at about the thickest part. The external circumflex artery can then be easily traced under the rectus, just outside which it divides into three branches, an ascending, trans- verse, and descending. The transverse passes under- neath the vastus externus, lying upon another muscle (crureus), which is now exposed. If it is traced on

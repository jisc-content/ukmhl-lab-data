Chap. IV.] 8s Dissection of Buttock, During the process of cleaning the sciatic nerve, some muscles which underlie will be brought into view ; they must now be dissected. Beginning from above downwards they are as follows : Obturator internus, with the gemellus superior above it, and the gemellus inferior below; after which come the quadratus femoris and the adductor magnus. These muscles must all be cleaned as far as the surroundings will permit it, care being taken not to injure the small anastomosing arteries, which have next to be dissected. Coming out between the adductor magnus and quadratus femoris is a branch of the internal cir- cumflex artery; it must be traced to anastomose with the external circumflex, which has already been seen on the front of the leg, and may now be seen before any dissection is attempted on the outside of the femur. A branch from the gluteal and sciatic can be traced down to these, and another up from the superior per- forating branch of the profunda femoris. To this anas- tomosis the term crucial has been applied. There is very often quite a network of anastomosis on the back of the great trochanter, and in the digital fossa. The nerve supply of all the muscles, except pyriformis, gemelli, and quadratus femoris, has now been seen. The nerves to the pyriformis lie inside the pelvis, and so must be dissected from the inside. The nerves to the quadratus femoris and obturator internus pass out of the pelvis by the great sciatic notch. That to the quadratus passes beneath the tendon of the obturator and gemelli, lying on the capsule of the hip and upon the ischium. It enters the front surface of the muscle, and to find it the great sciatic nerve should be drawn towards the great trochanter of the femur, the quadratus femoris and inferior gemellus separated, and the nerve sought for close to the tuberosity of the ischium. When it has been found,

[Chap. IX. The Dissector''s Manual, 286 limb they have all been cut away, they may be dismissed without further remark. The deeper muscles of the back are as follows : Serratus posticus, superior and inferior. Muscles at the back of the neck, viz.: Splenius. Trachelo-mastoid. Complexus and biventer cervicis. Levator anguli scapuhe. Semispinalis colli. Muscles of suboccipital tri- angle, viz. : Superior oblique. Inferior oblique. Eectus capitis posticus major. Eectus capitis posticus minor. At the junction of the cervical with the dorsal, and the dorsal with the lumbar regions, a thin and broad band of muscular fibres may be seen running to the angles of the ribs. These are the serratus posticus, su- perior and inferior. They should be cleaned, divided near their spinal attachment, and turned outwards. It is sometimes difficult to determine the exact width of these muscles, because a layer of fascia, sometimes called the vertebral aponeurosis, stretches from the superior to the inferior. This aponeurosis or fascia is attached to the spines of the vertebrae internally, and to the angles of the ribs externally. It is frequently attached to the sheath of the latissimus dorsi below, and above it sends a thin prolongation under the splenius, to become continuous with its sheath. The splenius may now be cleaned from origin to insertion. That part of the muscle which is attached to the mastoid process and superior curved line (sple- nius capitis) should be done first. The muscles of opposite sides will be found to diverge above, and in the triangular interval between them the com- plexus can be seen. This portion of complexus may be cleaned, but in doing so care must be taken not to cut away the great occipital nerve which pierces it. The splenius colli consists of about three or four

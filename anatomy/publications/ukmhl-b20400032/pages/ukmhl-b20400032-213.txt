Chap. VI.] Posterior Mediastinum. 199 veins. He must not omit to dissect out the superior intercostal vein on the left side, and see from how many spaces it collects blood, and trace it across the arch of the aorta to the left innominate vein. The branches of the sympathetic ganglia must now be carefully dissected, and the three splanchnic nerves which come off from the six lower dorsal sympathetic ganglia carefully traced down to the diaphragm. The upper or great splanchnic is usually derived by four or five roots from the sixth, seventh, eighth^ ninth, tenth dorsal ganglia ; the lesser splanchnic has usually two roots from the tenth and eleventh, and there can generally be seen to be a third splanchnic nerve from the twelfth ganglion. These nerves should be preserved^as they must even- tually be traced through the diaphragm to the solar and renal plexuses, which are dissected with the abdomen. Between the aorta and vena azygos major, and lying on the intercostal arteries, the student will dis cover, if he carefully removes the connective tissue, what looks at first sight like a small empty vein. This is the thoracic duct, which must be traced to the diaphragm, and upwards into the neck, to open into the junction of the subclavian and jugular veins. Its relations in the upper part of the thorax must be very carefully studied, as they are often neglected, though of great importance. In order to display the thoracic duct more readily, a portion of its wall must be seized with the forceps, and a small cut made in it. If the blow-pipe be in- serted, it can be injected with air; or a syringe may be used to introduce some coloured material. The vagi will have been seen (one in front and the other behind the oesophagus) during the dissec- tion of the posterior mediastinum. They should not be further gone into at this stage, but left till later, when the various nerve plexuses of the thorax are

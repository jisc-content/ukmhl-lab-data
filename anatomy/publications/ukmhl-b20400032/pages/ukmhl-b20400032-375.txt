361 Chap. XIV.] Fourth Ventricle, backwards, along each side of the middle line. It is caused by the fibres of the lateral columns of the cord, which are continued up through the floor of the fourth ventricle, as the fasciculi teretes, into the crus cerebri, and thence into the optic thalamus. It has been seen how the posterior columns of the cord diverge to go to the cerebellum. The lateral columns and the grey matter of the cord lie beneath them (looking from behind), so that when the posterior columns diverge, the parts beneath them come into view. In this way the lateral column, under the name of the fasciculus teres, and the grey matter, are exposed upon the floor of the fourth ventricle. (Vide Fig. 45, page 342.) The spinal nerves rise from the grey matter of the cord. The cranial nerves, as far forward as the fourth, arise from the grey matter of the medulla. The strige transversse divide the floor of the ventricle into an upper and lower part. In the upper part (upon a fresh brain), a bluish- looking spot, locus coeruleus, can be seen. A streak which runs upwards from it is called the taenia vio- lacea. The fifth, sixth, and seventh nerves arise above the strise, the eighth and ninth below. {Vide Fig. 46.) A vertical (antero-posterior) section should be made into the optic thalamus, to show that no nuclei can be distinguished in it. Its grey and white matter are mingled. A vertical section made through the corpus striatum shows that the grey matter is divided into two parts by the white. The layer of grey matter which protrudes into the ventricle is called the nucleus caudatus, or intraventricular nucleus. The nucleus beneath the white matter is called the nucleus lenticularis, or extra ventricular nucleus. There is another nucleus (claustrum) between the nucleus lenticularis and island of Heil, but it is more difficult to see. Lastly, a vertical section should be made through the lobes of the cerebellum to display the arbor vitse and nucleus dentatus.

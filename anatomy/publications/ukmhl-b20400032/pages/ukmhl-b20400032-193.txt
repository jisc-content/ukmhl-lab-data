If the layer of fascia which is held at each end by pieces of string be traced, after removal of the peri- toneum, it will be found to be continued as a thickish white layer on to the sides of the bladder, whilst farther back it passes in a similar manner to the sides Fig. 26.â€”Diagram skewing the relation of the Rccto-vesical Fascia and Levator Ani to the Rectum. of the rectum (Fig. 26). In front it is continued on to the prostate, splitting to form a capsule for it. This fascia must be carefully cleaned; it will be found to cover the upper surface of some muscular fibres (the levator ani). A scheme of its arrangement will be seen in the diagrams of the pelvic fascia (Figs. 25 and 26), where it is named recto-vesical.

32 The Dissector's' Manual. [Chap. iii. I>irecti4>ii§ of bend of cI]]>ow and front of fore-ariM.—The following surface markings require to be made out : Styloid processes of radius and ulna. Veins at bend of elbow. Outlines of pronator radii teres, and supinator longus. Tendon of biceps. Tendons at front of wrist. From within outwards: ( Flexor carpi ulnaris. \ Flexor sublimis digitorum. 1 Palmaris longus. ( Flexor carpi radialis. Course of radial artery and nerve. Course of ulnar artery and nerve. Course of median nerve. Exact position of wrist-joint. If the radius and ulna be followed downwards, each will be found to end in a pointed process (styloid processes). They indicate the position of the wrist- joint. If the hand be completely flexed upon the fore-arm, a transverse wrinkle appears at their level Avhich marks the line of the joint, which is much higher than it is usually expected to be. The veins at the bend of the elbow are often a little irregular. They can easily be studied upon the student's own arm. If pressure be made in the arm over the course of the cephalic or basilic veins they become prominent. The depression in front of the bend of the elbow, in which so many important structures lie, is bounded below by two converging muscles, the supinator longus and pronator radii teres ; their position and outline should be noted. The tendons at the wrist are important, as they are the guides to the radial and ulnar arteries and their accompanying nerves. They can easily be examined by the student upon his own wrist. A line drawn from the middle of the bend of the elbow straight down the arm to the radial side of the tendon of flexor carpi radialis indicates the course of the radial

Chap. VI.] Posterior Mediastinum. 195 fingers or the handle of a scalpel. If the adhesions are very strong, dissection may be necessary to free them. When the lungs are quite freed from any un- natural attachment which they may have acquired, they will be found to be connected with the rest of the thorax by the roots only, which are situated close to the middle line. The student must put his hand into the chest, and verify for himself the exact limits of the pleural cavity, noting how far the apex extends above the upper thoracic aperture, the relations of the subclavian artery to it, and how large a part of the upper aperture it occupies. At the same time, he must bear in mind that the lung very rarely fills the pleural cavity, for the lung is an elastic bag, and, unless it is f ully dis- tended, leaves the extremities of the pleura unoccupied, in the living subject as well as in the dead. This is particularly the case in the lower part of the pleura. In consequence of this it is quite possible, if the liver be stabbed, to pass through two layers of pleura, and yet avoid the lung altogether. The diaphragm had better be examined at this stage, and its dome shape observed. The student will then readily understand that its sides are flattened each time it contracts, and so enlarges the cavity of the thorax. It must be dissected when the viscera have been removed. The posterior mediastimtiii,â€” If the two lungs are lifted up from the position in which they were lying when the chest-wall was opened, and the right and left hand of the student placed under the right and left lungs respectively, he will find that his fingers do not touch in front of the vertebral column ; there is something intervening. This is the posterior mediastinum, which lies on the front of the vertebrae, and has the pleura on either side of it, and the peri- cardium in front. Higher up above the level of the

350 The Dissector^s Manual, [Chap. xiv. with the tips of the fingers, in order to expose the upper surface of the corpus callosum. The ante- rior cerebral arteries have been previously seen and removed, and it is not difficult to see that the corpus callosum is composed of transverse fibres (strije trans- versse). It has been seen before that it does not extend either as far forwards or as far backwards as the hemispheres. The posterior extremity (pad, splenium, bourrelet) should be raised, by keeping the cerebellum depressed and lifting up the hemispheres; it will be seen that it is thick and round, and that the pia mater passes into the interior of the brain beneath it. The aperture through which the pia mater enters is called the fissure of Bichat. Later on, when a vertical section has been made of the corpus callosum, the pad behind and genu in front will be seen to be the thickest parts, owing to the fact that a greater number of transverse fibres pass through these portions of the corpus callosum to join the frontal and occipital lobes of one side to those of the other. Running along the middle of the corpus callosum, and turning over the genu in front, are two small longitudinal bands of fibres (nerves of Lancisi). If the gyrus fornicatus be lifted up, so as to expose the ventricle of the corpus callosum, similar bands can sometimes be seen in it (covered bands of Reil, striae obtectse). If it is desired to see the transverse fibres of the corpus callosum radiating outwards (Fig. 45) to join the convolutions of opposite sides together, a very well-hardened brain should be chosen, and the hemispheres torn away at the level of corpus callosum. The radiating filDres cannot be traced in their continuity, but simply give the torn brain a fibrous appearance (fibrous cone of Mayo ; corona radiata). If the student attempts to see this upon the brain he is dissecting, great caution is required lest important parts in the interior be lacerated.

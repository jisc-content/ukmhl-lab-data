288 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. ix. nerve pierces it, a little below the occipital bone, and its ends turned upwards and downwards. This must be done without injuring the great occipital nerve. Beneath the complexus is a quantity of very dense connective tissue and fat, beneath which the following should be found : Suboccipital triangle and con- Semispinalis colli muscle. tents. Posterior divisions of cervical Princeps cervicis, and nerves. Profunda cervicis arteries. The suboccipital triangle may be dissected first. In many dissecting-rooms the body is not turned over long enough to allow the suboccipital triangle to be dissected. Under these circumstances it may be left until convenient. But if the dissection be continued the triangle will be found situated imme- diately beneath the occipital bone, so that in order to expose it easily the head requires to be bent well forwards. The triangle is not of any great size, and is bounded by the muscles which rotate the head, viz., superior oblique, inferior oblique, and rectus capitis posticus major. The rectus capitis posticus minor is just outside the triangle, nearer the middle line. Before attempting to make out the boundaries of the triangle, the positions of the bony points to which the muscles are attached should be ascertained. In the middle line, and a little below the occipital bone, the spine of the axis must be felt, and the removal of the connective tissue may be begun at its situation. (The principal insertion of the semispinalis colli marks this prominence with great clearness.) The end of the transverse process of the atlas should be felt for, lying beneath the mas- toid process, and extending nearly as far out as its tip. The usual plan is to be followed in dissecting this space : first, to define its boundaries, and then make

129 Chap, v.] The Male FERm^EUM, the back of the scrotum, and a second just in front of the anus. Take care to turn back nothing more than the skin, otherwise the superficial sphincter ani will be cut away. There is usually a considerable amount of fat in this region underlying the skin. The skin flaps must be reflected farther outwards than the margins of the bony outlet of the pelvis, so as to expose just the origin of the thigh muscles. If the student scrapes carefully round the margin of the anus when tlje skin is removed, he will, if the body be sufliciently fresh, find the fibres of the super- ficial sphincter encircling it. The deep sphincter is only the thickened lower end of the intrinsic muscular fibres of the rectum, and must be exposed by stretching or slitting open the lower end of the bowel, and removing the mucous membrane, when it will be clearly seen. A white line is said to separate the external from the internal sphincter (Hilton). An inch or less from the margin of the anus, radiating towards it, are some small arteries and veins, and accompanying them some nerves, which are going to supply the skin of this region ; they can be traced outwards by incisions radiating from the anus towards the ischial tuberosity, where they spring from the pudic artery, vein, and nerve respec- tively. The perinseum receives almost the whole of its blood and nerve supply from the pudic vessels and nerves. When the studelit has dissected the external sphincter as far back as the tip of the coccyx, he will have no difliculty in discovering the edge of the gluteus maximus, and along its edge, which stretches from this point to the ischial tuberosity, he will discover some small twigs of the lesser sciatic nerve.

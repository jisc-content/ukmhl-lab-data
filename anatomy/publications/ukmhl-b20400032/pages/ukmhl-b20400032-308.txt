As far as the origins and insertions of these muscles are concerned, it will be found that they vary very much. Koughly speaking, most of the muscles may be said to be attached to an equal number of ribs or vertebrae, both at their origin and insertion. Those in the upper dorsal and lower cervical region are nearly all of them attached to half the dorsal and half the cervical vertebrse. When the muscles of the back have been sufficiently dissected, the smaller muscles of the vertebral column may be examined. The muscles which have been already studied should be removed, and then the most important of the small muscles made out. These are the levatores costarum, which should be cleaned from the tip of the transverse process above to the margin of the rib below. It is only necessary to clean one or two of these muscles. Other muscular fibres will be seen running from one point to another on the vertebrae (multifidus spinae), some from spine to spine, others from spine to transverse processes, and others between the transverse processes. These fibres may be made out in the lower region of the spine, where they form a considerable mass underlying the erector, which must be divided below and turned outwards to expose them. Separation of tBie larynx and pSiarynx, and front of ttie gjktill, from tlie spine and bacM. part of sliitll,â€”It will usually be found most convenient at this time to pass on to the dissection of the larynx and pharynx rather than the spinal cord. In most dissecting-rooms the body does not remain upon its belly a sufficient time to permit the spinal cord to be dissected at such an early stage, but if it has been injected with spirit it will keep in good condition. In order to remove the larynx and pharynx it is

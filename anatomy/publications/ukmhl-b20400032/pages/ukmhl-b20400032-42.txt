The posterior circumflex artery will be seen to run backwards a little above it, disappearing with its accompanying nerve through a quadrilateral opening. The boundaries of both these openings should be examined and learnt. Coming from the posterior end of the brachial plexus, and quite at the back of the axilla, are the three subscapular nerves; they supply three muscles : latissimus dorsi, the teres major, and subscapularis. The latissimus dorsi is farthest from the posterior cord, and is therefore supplied by the longest nerve, the long subscapular nerve; the teres major, nearer to the cord, is supplied by the middle subscapular nerve; and the subscapularis, upon which the posterior cord lies, is supplied 'by the short subscapular nerve. The nerves run in a vertical direction down the axilla, and are to be sought for by vertical cuts. The long subscapular nerve is the easiest to find, and should be looked for as it enters the muscle, and traced up- wards. The other nerves lie parallel to it, but very deep in the axilla. When these nerves have been found, the three muscles which they supply should be cleaned as far as is possible. The tendinous inter- sections of the subscapularis are usually visible. The veins of the axilla correspond to the arteries, and should be dissected with them. When filled with blood they are of considerable size.

132 The Dissector's Manual, [Chnp. v. form the front boundary of the ischio-rectal fossa. It there becomes continuous with what has been already described, but not yet seen, the triangular ligament. In front it can be traced up to become continuous with the fascia of the abdomen. It is very easy, if great care be not taken, to remove this layer of fascia along with the fat which lies upon it. To avoid doing so, the student should scrape with the handle of his scalpel at the border of the rami of the pubes, as by so doing he will run less chance of wounding the fascia. When a portion of the surface of the fascia has been exposed by the method just described, a small hole should be made in it with the point of the knife, and the blow-pipe inserted. The blow-pipe must then be secured by a piece of string, and the fascia inflated with air. It is possible to distend the space under the fascia with water by means of a syringe; but neither of the above manceuvres is easy to accomplish, as the fascia is dense, and fits so tightly in its place that even when it is distended with urine, as it some- times is in the case of extravasation, there is no very great bulging. This fascia is usually called the deep layer of the superficial fascia. Its connection with the fascia of the abdomen, with which it is con- tinuous, can be traced either by dissection, or by one of the modes above described. The exact relationship of these fasciae will be better under- stood by reference to Fig. 19. When its arrangement has been thoroughly mastered, it can be cut down the middle line of the body and along its posterior edge, where it winds round the transversus perinsei muscle to be attached to the triangular ligament. The flaps can be turned aside over the rami of the pubes and ischium^ like a pair of folding-doors. The following muscles will be exposed : In the centre, surrounding

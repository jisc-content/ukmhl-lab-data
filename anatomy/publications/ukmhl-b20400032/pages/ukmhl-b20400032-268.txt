254 The Dissector's Manual. ichap. ix. stand out, the head should be pulled strongly to the opposite side. When this is done fibres will often come into view crossing the side of the neck. These are the fibres of the platysma rayoides. In the living subject, pressure above the clavicle will bring the external jugular vein into view, extending from the middle of the clavicle to a point midway between the angle of the jaw and mastoid process. In the dissecting-rooms its course is usually marked by a line of discoloration. In front of the sterno-mastoid the structures in the middle line of the neck are of especial importance. The rings of the trachea, cricoid cartilage, and hyoid bones should be felt, both on the subject and on the student's own body. There are two great triangles of the neck, but each is subdivided into smaller ones. Anterior to the sterno-mastoid, and bounded in front by the middle line of the neck, above by the lower jaw and a line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process, and behind by the sterno-mastoid, is the anterior triangle. Behind the sterno-mastoid is the posterior triangle ; its boundaries are, in front, the sterno-mastoid; behind, the trapezius; and below, the clavicle. It has been previously mentioned that in order to permit the arm to be removed this triangle is conveniently dissected before the orbit or face. It may be well to remember, that it is necessary in dissecting these triangles to learn: (1)their boundaries; (2) coverings; (3) contents; (4) relative positions of contents. I>i§secti©ii of posterior triangle of neck,— The following skin incisions should be made: one along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, from the mastoid process to the clavicle; another along the border of the trapezius, from the mastoid pix)cess to the lower attachment of the muscle ; and a third along the upper border of the clavicle. Care must be taken,

245 Chap. IX.] Nerves of the Face. s^ai^hter anjd...mom^^siixterficial course, is the facial vein. No difficulty will be experienced in tracing it from the centre of the frontal bone to the front border of the masseter, but its branches are not usually made out. They correspond to the arteries. The nerves of the face have hardly been men- tioned. They are derived from the three divisions of the fifth nerve and from the facial. The supra- orbital, infraorbital, and mental branches of the fifth should be found in the following manner : The supra- orbital branches have been already seen and dissected. It will be remembered that they came out at the notch just below the centre of the upper margin of the orbit, along with a small artery. To see the infraorbital nerve and artery, the levator labii superioris proprius must be either cut through or turned well on one side. When the nerve and its three sets ol branches ^ (palpebral, nasal, and labial) have been dissected, the remaining fat in the canine fossa should be removed, and the branches of the nerve pulled aside, to permit the levator anguli oris muscle to be seen and dissected. The mental branch of the inferior dental nerve comes out through the mental foramen in the lower jaw, situated just below the second bicuspid tooth. The depressor anguli oris will require removal before this nerve can be seen. It is therefore evident that a line drawn from the centre of the orbit downwards through the second bicuspid tooth will indicate the positions of these three nerves, and of the small arteries which accompany them. With care the small malar branch of the temporo- malar nerve, already mentioned, may be seen coming out of its foramen on the facial surface of the malar bone. The great motor nerve to the muscles of the face, the facial, has not been mentioned yet. Its main trunk will best be seen when the parotid region is dissected. At present a few delicate branches may

Chap. IV.] Dissection of Back of Thigh, 87 AtL incision must be made through the skin in the line of the great sciatic nerve as far as the knee, and a transverse incision must be made about two inches below the joint at its lower end. The skin having been reflected, and the lesser sciatic nerve traced down- wards, it will be seen to give cutaneous branches to the whole of this region. A few small twigs coine round from the external and internal cutaneous nerves, but these will not be found unless they are traced from the nerves themselves on the front. The cutaneous arteries and veins are unimportant, and are derived from those in the neighbourhood ; sometimes a super- ficial vessel can be traced down with the small sciatic nerve. The deep fascia will be readily exposed by the removal Of the superficial; and the hamstrings, semi- membranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps, will come into view. They must be cleaned and dissected away from the adductor magnus, which is on their deep surface. In doing so, care must be taken not to cut aWay their nerves, which can be very easily found, and traced back to the great sciatic nerve, which next comes into view. These muscles must be very carefully dissected out above, so as to see their exact relative position on the ischial tuberosityj and they must be all traced to their insertions; the semitendinosus has, very probably, been seen at its insertion on the front of the leg. The handle of the knife should be pushed beneath the heads of the gastrocnemius, and the muscle raised to show the synovial bursse beneath them. They com- municate with the knee-joint, and that to the inner head of the gastrocnemius is prolonged beneath the semimembranosus. This is a good opportunity to run over the other bursye round the knee, viz., those beneath the popliteus, biceps, and about patella. Where the hamstrings divei-ge below, they enclose a space called the popliteal space^ or ham, the contents

53 Chap. IV.] The Dissection of the Leg. very simple, as far as their ligaments are concerned. The arrangement in all of them is that there are ligaments at each side, called external and internal, and in front and behiMd, called anterior and posterior. The joints of the wrist, fingers, knee, and ankle all conform to the above rales. It is necessary to learn the attachments of these ligaments, and see under what conditions they are tight or slack. Afterwards, any special ligaments are to be learnt; the orbicular in the case of the elbow, the fibro-cartilage in the wrist. Wrist.â€”The relations and external ligaments of the wrist should be made out. Afterwards its capsule should be opened, and the triangular fibro-cartilage examined. The ligaments of the carpus (dorsal, palmar, and interosseous) may be afterwards examined, and those on the dorsum divided to expose the synovial sacs of the wrist and carpus. The meta- carpo - phalangeal and phalangeal joints should be observed to be devoid of posterior, but to have espe- cially thick anterior, ligaments. CHAPTER lY. DISSECTION OF THE LEG. For purposes of dissection, the leg includes the OS innominatura, and the structures by which the leg is attached to it. It may conveniently be divided into the following regions, which should be dissected in regular order from above dovmwards if possible. The body is usually turned over on to the face, before the whole of the front of the leg is finished, and in this case

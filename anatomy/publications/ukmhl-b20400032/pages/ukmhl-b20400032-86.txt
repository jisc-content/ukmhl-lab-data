The muscles will be seen to consist of two groups, each of which has separate functions. On the inner side of the thigh are the adductors, supplied by the obturator nerve, which also sends a branch to the pectineus. This muscle receives its principal nerve-supply from the anterior crural, since it belongs to that group of muscles which flex the thigh upon the abdomen, and which comprise in addition the psoas, iliacus, and muscles forming the quadriceps extensor femoris, viz., the two vasti, the rectus, and crureus. Sometimes, the vastus internus and crureus being blended below, are spoken of as one muscle, but it seems simpler to refer to them as separate ones. The course and relations of the femoral and pro- funda arteries and veins must be carefully studied and re-studied, and the origin, insertions, and exact nerve- supply of the muscles learnt. When this has been done, the thigh should be carefully covered up, either with its own skin or with some gutta-percha tissue, and kept for future reference, for it needs to be many times gone over before it can be thoroughly mastered.

The bony prominences around the head of tibia were felt before the thigh was dissected. If the fingers are passed down the inner side of the leg below the knee, the tibia will be felt to be sub- cutaneous the whole way down to the ankle, and will

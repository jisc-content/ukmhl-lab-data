142 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. v. completely surrounded by the fold, as will be seen by referring to the small intestines in the same Fig., and it will be able to move within certain limits, which will be determined by the length of the fold which attaches it to the body wall, and which is technically called a mesentery. It is by passing between the two layers of the mesentery that the vessels and nerves reach the intestine. It only remains to consider where the anterior layer of the sac which does not touch the viscera is attached, and the student will have obtained a general idea of the arrangement of the peritoneum. This anterior layer is firmly adherent to the front wall of the abdomen, and is termed the parietal layer, whilst that portion which covers the viscera is called the visceral layer. From this description it will be clear that the dis- section which has been performed so far has brought the student into the sac of the peritoneum, the outer layer of which is adherent to the body wall, whilst the inner layer still covers the intestines which are brought into view. The further complications in its arrangement which must next be studied, are brought about by the alterations in situation which the viscera undergoes during the process of development. The student will do well to bear in mind that during life there is no unoccupied space in the sac of the peritoneum, because the visceral and parietal layers touch one another, only a few ounces of fluid intervening. The arraiagement of the peritoneum.â€” In order to learn the arrangement of the peritoneal folds, it is best to study it first in its longitudinal sec- tion, and then at one or two situations in the trans- verse section. By following the directions here given, and by the aid of the accompanying diagrams, the student

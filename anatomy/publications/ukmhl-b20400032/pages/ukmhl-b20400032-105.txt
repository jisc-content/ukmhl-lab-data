Chap. IV.] Back of Leg and Ankle. muscle, wliicli will now be seen from tlie back of the leg. When the superficial muscles are cleaned, the soleus must be divided close to where it takes origin from the back of the fibula, and the outer head of the gastrocnemius divided close to its origin; these muscles can then be turned over towards the inner side of the leg to display the deeper structures. This will enable the student to trace the popliteal artery and nerve onwards. At the lower border of the popliteus the artery divides into anterior and posterior tibial. The anterior tibial will be seen to pass for- ward to the front of the leg under the lower border of the popliteus muscle, which has not been mentioned. The posterior tibial passes, with its nerve, under an aponeurotic arch formed by the soleus. When the soleus has been reflected from its attachments the peroneal artery will be seen given off from the poste- rior tibial. After the soleus has been reflected from its attach- ments to the tibia and fibula, the popliteal nerve (now become the posterior tibial) will be seen running super- ficial to the artery, like the rest of the large nerves on the back of the leg. It will be seen to lie first inside the posterior tibial artery, and then, just where the peroneal artery is given off*, to cross and lie on its outer side. Usually the structures can be seen as above described without much further dissection, but, at any rate, they should be carefully cleaned as far as the heel, care being taken not to remove the internal annular ligament. With the peroneal artery this is impossible at present,^ as it runs in the substance of the flexor longus pollicis. The posterior tibial artery and nerve will be seen when cleaned to give branches to all the sub- jacent muscles except the popliteus, which receives its

36 The Dissector's Manual. ichap. iii. When the back of the arm is dissected, the student will see that, before the superior profunda passes through the external intermuscular septum it gives off a large branch, which runs down the back of the intermuscular septum, to anastomose behind the external condyle with the recurrent branch of the posterior interosseous artery. It may therefore be said that the superior profunda divides into two terminal branches, which descend to anastomose in front of and behind the outer condyle. The inferior profunda artery, which runs with the ulnar nerve, divides in a similar manner. The anterior branch runs down in front of the inner condyle, to anastomose with a recurrent branch (anterior ulnar recurrent) of the ulnar artery. The posterior runs with the ulnar nerve behind the internal condyle, to anastomose with another recurrent branch of the ulnar artery (posterior ulnar recurrent). The anterior ulnar re- current runs superficially, and close to the ulnar side of the median nerve. The posterior ulnar recurrent runs beneath the superficial flexors and over the flexor profundus. The remaining artery, and that which forms the greatest anastomosis, is the anas- tomotica magna. It arises from the inner side of the branchial, a little above the condyles, winds round the inner side of the arm, piercing the internal intermuscular septum, runs transversely between the triceps and the back of the humerus, to end behind the outer condyle. It anastomoses with all the arteries about the elbow, with the exception of those in front of the outer condyle. It cannot at present be dissected behind ; but, when it is, it will be seen to receive an additional anastomosing branch from the superior profunda. The common interosseous artery and the deep flexors (flexor longus pollicis and profundus digi- torum) may now be cleaned, and the anterior

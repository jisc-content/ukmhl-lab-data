189 The Thorax. Chap. VI.] second diagram, to the back wall. The student should carefully compare the two diagrams, and with their aid learn to map out accurately all the viscera. CJeneral description of tlioracic viscera.— In order better to appreciate the relations of the viscera in the thorax, it is customary to describe it as follows : On either side, and occupying by far the larger part of the thoracic cavity, are the two lungs in their serous sacs (pleurse). The space which lies between them is called the mediastinum. It is usually divided into three, an anterior, middle, and posterior medias- tinum. The middle is occupied by the heart and great vessels ; it is the largest of the three. The anterior mediastinum is the smallest, and occupies the space in front of the middle mediastinum, whilst the posterior lies in front of the vertebral column, and contains the descending aorta, oesophagus, etc. Creneral principles to toe tooriie in mind during: dissection.—It follows, then, from this description, that the proper way to dissect the thorax after having mastered the construction of its walls, is to inspect and learn the position of the lungs and pleurae first, as their position is easily mastered, and then pass on to the three mediastina and their contents. After this is finished, the lungs must be completed, and the relationship of the structures that pass from the neck to the thorax, and from the thorax to abdomen, must be made out. Before opening the thorax, the position of the viscera must be mapped out by the aid of some pins and pieces of string, and by referring to the diagram of the thorax. It is of the greatest importance that the student should be familiar with the surface mark- ings of the heart and great vessels at the root of the neck.

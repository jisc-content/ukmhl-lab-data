Chap. XL] The Ear, 321 following parts are to be recognised upon the inner wall ; Promontory. Grooves on promontorj^ for Jacobson's nerves (tympanic plexus). Fenestra ovalis. Fenestra rotunda. Ridge for Fallopian aqueduct. The remaining relations of the tympanum are, above, a thin plate of bone, which separates it from the cranial cavity. This has been removed. Below are the carotid canal, jugular fossa, and foramen for Jacobson's nerve ; behind, the mastoid cells and pro- montory ; in front, the Eustachian tube and Glasserian fissure. The vestibule, cochlea, and Fallopian aqueduct still remain for dissection. If the student desires to attempt to see the contents of the vestibule, viz., utricle, saccule, and membranous semicircular canals, it would be requisite to obtain a fresh temporal bone, and place it in spirit for at least a week, in order to harden the soft parts. After it has been in spirit a sufficient time, it should be placed in dilute nitric or hydrochloric acid, until the bone is well decalcified. A correct idea having previously been obtained from the dry sections as to the positions of the tym- panum and vestibule, the decalcified bone may be gradually removed until the membranous labyrinth is exposed. This procedure is often uuvsuccessful if attempted upon an ordinary dissecting-room part. In the re- maining portion of the temporal bone, the facial nerve should be first dissected, and afterwards the vestibule and cochlea as far as is possible. If it is desired to obtain a more exact knowledge of the vestibule and cochlea, they should be examined on the dry bones, and upon proper microscopic sections made from the ear of a guinea-pig.

152 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap, v layer of the transverse mesocolon, when they will be seen to disappear from view between the duodenum and the pancreas. With care and patience the nerves may be traced as well. Sometimes the student can obtain a view of the vessels and nerves of the small intestine by a method which is at once rapid and effectual, viz., by stripping off the peritoneum with his thumb and finger. To do this, he must make two parallel cuts, about two inches apart, reaching as nearly as possible to the exact depth of the vessels. The cuts must be extended from the intestine to where the mesentery is attached to the spine, and must be joined by two similar trans- verse cuts. If the two upper corners be dissected up for about a quarter of an inch, they can be seized between the thumb and finger of each hand, and the flap which has been marked out can be torn off in the direction of the intestine. It is very likely that an excellent view will be obtained; if not, attempts can be made till the method succeeds, as the process is a very rapid one. When the dissection of the vessels is complete, the intestine must be tied below the duodenum, and at the lower ends of the small intestines. To avoid spilling the contents of the bowel, it is best to tie it across above and below, with two pieces of string about an inch apart, and to divide between them. It must then be separated from the mesentery with a knife, so as to remove it from the body, and the mesentery itself can be cut away from the spine. About twelve inches of intestine from the upper end should be preserved for inspection, and twelve from the lower; the rest may be buried. Those portions which are preserved can either be opened at once or kept till a more convenient season. It is far better to open them at once, as they only

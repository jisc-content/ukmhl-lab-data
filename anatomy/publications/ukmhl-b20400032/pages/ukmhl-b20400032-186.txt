172 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. v. duct in the thorax, where it has already been found, if any difficulty is experienced in finding it at this point, and its whereabouts will then be made clear. As was described in the dissection of the thorax, it is possible to distend it with air by means of a blow-pipe, or with fluid by the aid of a syringe. (Tide page 199.) Usually on the poin,t of the body of the second lumbar vertebra, the thoracic duct is seen to dilate to form the receptaculum chyli, which is about three- quarters of an inch or more in length, and of variable diameter. The vena azygos must be traced down on the side of the vertebral column, where it will be seen to Receive branches from the body wall, particulai'ly from the lumbar region (lumbar veins). Through the aortic opening the sympathetic some- times passes ; but it has been already traced piercing the crura. The student will remember that the sym- pathetic nerves usually pierce the crura, and may pass under the internal arcuate ligaments with the psoas. The origin of the psoas from the sides of the vertebral column must be traced, and likewise its in- sertion into the lesser trochanter. Round the lumbar artery and vein, where they disappear between the psoas and the vertebral column, an aponeurotic arch of fibres should be traced, from which some of the fibres of the muscle take origin. l>lsse€ti®ii tlie liiisil^sir plexus.—The psoas and iliacus, and quadratus lumborum, having been divested of their fascia, there will be seen lying upon them tlie various branches of the lumbar plexus, as they emerge from the psoas muscle. The i)l<^xus itself is situated in the substance of the psoas muscle. Beginning from above downwards, the following serves will be seen :

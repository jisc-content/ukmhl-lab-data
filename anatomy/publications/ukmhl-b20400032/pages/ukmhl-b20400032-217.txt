From the anterior and posterior cardiac plexuses, if the pericardium be removed, some branches can be RIGHT AURiCLE ANTERIOR COROI'WKRY POSTERIOR CORON^RY LEFT AUftlCLE Fig. 27.â€”Scheme of Branches of the Deep Cardiac Plexus. traced downwards to the anterior and posterior coro- nary plexuses. These plexuses follow the coronary arteries, and must be looked for upon them. The branches from the plexus to the heart sub- stance itself can rarely, if ever, be traced in a dis- secting-room body.

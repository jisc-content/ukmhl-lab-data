The left superior intercostal vein will probably be seen coming from the upper spaces, and crossing the aortic arch to join the left innominate vein. The oesophagus will not be seen unless a piece of cane of some kind is passed down it. It is better to do this if the dissection of the other parts of the body is far enough advanced to allow of it, as the student will then readily grasp the situation of this important structure. When this examination is completed, the posterior mediastinum should be opened by an incision on each side of the vertebral column, and its contents exposed by the removal of the cellular tissue. The aorta has already been seen, and needs only to have the intercostal arteries traced to it. The oesophagus must be carefully dissected, and its rela- tionship to the aorta made out and mastered, care being taken to avoid injuring the plexus of nerves which surround it just below the roots of the lungs. The vena azygos on the right side will be seen to receive all the intercostal veins. Those of the upper one or two spaces unite to form a superior intercostal vein. On the left side the vena azygos crosses over the spine at or about the level of the sixth dorsal vertebra, and joins the right azygos. The veins from the two or three upper left intercostal spaces open into the left superior intercostal vein, which has already been looked for crossing the arch of the aorta to open into the left innominate vein. The others empty separately into the right azygos, or else unite to form one or two trunks, which collect the blood, and then convey it to the right azygos. The veins often vary considerably at this point, and the student should consult some work on descrip- tive anatomy, so as to understand the various arrange- ments. The senior student will derive much aid on this point by his knowledge of the development of the

Chap, v.] The Pelvic Fascia, i8i them out entirely on his own part, the student should refer frequently to the diagrams of the pelvic fascia, and then endeavour to verify the diagrams. When once the course of the fascia in the pelvis has been demonstrated, the relations of the rest of the structures will be easy. Before passing on to the vessels, it will be better to examine the opposite side of the pelvis, and trace again the connections between the recto-vesical and the rest of the pelvic fascia. To effect this, the peritoneum must be stripped off the wall of the pelvis, where it forms the lateral false ligament of the bladder. This should be done in the same way as it was performed on the left side. At the edge of the brim of the true pelvis the fascia will be clearly seen to be attached to the bone, and must then be traced downwards all round the cavity. It will be found when cleaned to be thick, and to cover the bone, and lower down the obturator internus. From this fascia the recto-vesical will be seen to be given off, and can be traced to the neck of the bladder and side of the rectum. Where the recto-vesical fascia begins to be given off from the obturator, a line is seen stretching all along its attach- ment. This is generally known by the name of the white line, and is due to the fact that the fascia is thickened where the recto-vesical is given off. If the pelvic fascia be traced backwards, it can be seen to lie in front of the sacral nerves^ but behind the branches of the iliac artery, between them. The rectum should be divested of all its connective- tissue covering and carefully dissected, so as to show its muscular coat, and the position it occupies with reference to the sacrum and coccyx behind, and the peritoneum, bladder, or vagina and uterus in front. By dissecting in front of the rectum, and following the ureter downwards, it can be traced into the

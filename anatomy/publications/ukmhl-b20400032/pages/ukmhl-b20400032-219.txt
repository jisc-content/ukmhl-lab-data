The Heart. 205 Chap. VI.] Dissection of the lieart and great vessels in situ.â€”The heart must be once more replaced in its natural situation in the body. Passing upwards from the apex towards the base is a groove, usually fitted with fat, marking the separa- tion of the right and left ventricles. Situated in this groove, a vessel (the left coronary artery) can be seen through the fat. It must be traced upwards on the left side of the pulmonary artery to the aorta. On the right side of the pulmonary artery is the right coronary artery, and just above this is the right auricle, into which the two vense cavee open. The coronary arteries must be traced round the heart to their destination. Accompanying them will be readily seen the cor- responding veins, all of which eventually empty into the so-called coronary sinus, which is nothing but a large vein lying in the auriculo-ventricular groove at the back of the heart. To display this, pull the apex of the heart upwards. On tracing this coronary sinus outwards towards the left side of the heart, a fold of pericardium of varying extent will be seen between the pulmonary artery and veins, and in this fold (the vestigial fold) lies the oblique vein of Marshall, the remains of the lefi: superior cava and left azygos vein, which existed during foetal life. The oblique vein extends from the left end of the coronary sinus over the root of the left lung to the left superior intercostal vein, and is most easily found by lifting the heart up and tracing the sinus upwards and towards the left. Tn some of the lower animals these veins remain permanent in the adult. There is, therefore, in the situation of the coronary sinus a left superior vena cava, into which the cardiac veins empty. This is well seen in the horse.

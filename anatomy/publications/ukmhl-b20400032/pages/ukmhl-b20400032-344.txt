330 The Dissector^s Manual. [Chap. xii. a fossa called the spheno-palatine, or splieno-maxillary, which has the superior maxilla in front and base of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid behind. The ganglion, and its most important branches, require to be exposed. To see the ganglion itself, the student should begin in the nasal cavity, and the bone which surrounds the spheno-palatine foramen should be freely removed with bone forceps. At the same time the orbital process of the palate bone and body of the sphenoid should be cut away. At present the sphenoid is only to be removed sufficiently to expose the foramen rotundum and superior maxillary nerve passing through it. This nerve should be carefully cleaned, and traced forwards towards the spheno- maxillary fissure. One or more branches should be sought for descending into the spheno-maxillary fossa, and disappearing amongst a quantity of fat and connective tissue. If these branches be carefully followed down they will lead to a reddish mass, which is the ganglion. The internal maxillary artery enters the spheno-maxillary fossa through the pterygo- maxillary fissure, and breaks up into very numerous branches. These arteries follow the branches of Meckel's ganglion, and may assist in finding them. They get greatly in the way, but if possible are to be preserved. The largest branches of the ganglion emerge from its internal, posterior, and inferior surfaces. The posterior branch (Vidian) should be found and traced backwards into the Vidian canal. To trace it through the canal it is necessary to remove more of the base of the pterygoid process. As this is being done a small nerve and artery may be seen running backwards through a canal upon the inner surface of the base of the pterygoid process. These are the pterygo-palatine nerve and artery running backwards to suj^jply the mucous membrane at the upper part of the pharynx. Being very small they

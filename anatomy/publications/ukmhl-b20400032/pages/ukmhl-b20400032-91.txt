Chap. IV.] The Dorsum of the Foot. 77 By passing his finger round the heel to its back part, the student will easily feel the outline of the OS calcis ; as he comes forward, just below the outer malleolus, he can feel a small prominence of bone (peroneal tubercle) between the tendons of the pero- neus longus and brevis; this is better marked in some people than in others. Some little distance down the outer border of the foot there is a very well-marked pro- minence, the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe. The tubercle of the scaphoid is one of the most important landmarks on the inner side of the foot. It is situated about two inches in front of the inner malleolus, and is a guide to the transverse tarsal joint. About an inch in front of it is the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The outlines of the metatarsal bones and phalanges are well marked, except on the fattest feet, and need no further description. A line drawn from midway between the two mal- leoli, to the middle of the cleft between the great and second toe, will mark out the course of the dorsalis pedis artery.

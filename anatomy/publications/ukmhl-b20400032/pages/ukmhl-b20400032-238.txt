224 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. viii. clearly distinguishable in those which have been preserved for dissection. The student will do well to remember that some authors describe the arachnoid as a serous membrane of two layers, a visceral and parietal. The parietal layer is simply a layer of endothelium, which, in this description, is supposed to belong to the dura mater. When the dura mater and falx cerebri have been divided, they should be drawn backwards, and the hemispheres of the brain exposed. In doing this a member of the superior cerebral veins, which empty into the superior longitudinal sinus, will have to be torn through. CHAPTEH "VIII. REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. If the brain has been treated with spirit, as was recommended at first, it will be by no means difficult to remove it without injuring the nerves at the base of the skull. The student should endeavour to remove the whole brain without lacerating it, and to cut the cranial nerves in such a manner as to leave a part of them attached to the brain to show their point of origin, and a portion at their place of exit from the dura mater. It must be noted that some of the cranial nerves pierce the dura mater a little distance from their point of exit from the skull. The left hand should be placed behind and on the top of the brain, to support it; a block having previously been placed beneath the occiput, the fingers of the right hand should gently lift the frontal lobes from the anterior fossa of the skull. The olfactory lobes, which rest on the cribriform plate, being covered with arachnoid.

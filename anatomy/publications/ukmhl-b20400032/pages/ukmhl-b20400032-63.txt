Chap. III.] Dissection of the Arm. 49 extensor muscles should be separated from the outer condyle, in order that the supinator brevis may be properly displayed; the radial artery and musculo- spiral nerve may also be cut away at this stage if they are found to impede the view. The student may now consider what skin incision would require to be made, and what structures removed, in order to expose tlie supinator brevis. Lastly, the extensors of the thumb and index finger may be cleaned as far as the posterior annular ligament. Dissection of tlie toack of the tiand.â€”The surface markings of this region comprise the following extensor tendons, enumerated in their order from radial to ulnar side : Extensor minimi digiti. Extensor carpi ulnaris. Posterior radial and ulnar veins. Radial artery. Posterior branches of ulnar and radial nerves. Extensor ossis, and Primi internodii pollicis. Extensor carpi radialis longior and brevier. Extensor secundi internodii pollicis. Extensor indicis. Extensor communis digito- rum. The extensor tendons may be distinguished frotn each other by observing their relations to the bones and the direction in which they run. The veins collect the blood from the fingers, and, like the tendons, can best be seen upon the student's own hand. The radial artery lies at the root of the thumb, in the triangular depression between the extensor secundi interiiodii pollicis and the extensor primi internodii. Tke cuta- neous nerves from the ulnar and radial al'e given off from their parent trunks a little aboV-is the wrist. They wind backwards, passing beneath the tendons of the supinator longus and extensor carpi ulnaris to be distributed to the fingers; the ulnar the same as in the palm, the radial the same as the median in the palm. These branches are so often overlooked, that

Chap. VL] Arteries of Root of Neck. 207 Immediately below this valve again is the coronary sinus guarded by its valve (the valve of Thebesius). Leading into the right ventricle is the large auriculo-ventricular valve, with its three divisions or cusps, therefore called the tricuspid. On examining the ventricle, numerous muscular bands (musculi papillares) will be seen attached to its walls, so as to strengthen them. These are of three kinds : those which are attached to the walls along their whole length, those which are attached merely by their two ends, and, lastly, those which are attached by one end to the ventricle wall, i^nd by the other to the tendinous cords (chordae tendinese) of the valves. The three semilunar valves at the commencement of the pulmonary artery should be examined. The left ventricle presents much the same appear- ance as the right, except that its walls are much thicker, and that the opening by which it com- municates with the left auricle is guarded by a bicuspid (mitral) valve. The orifice of the aorta, like that of the pulmonary artery, is guarded by three semilunar valves. The relations of tlie g^reat felood-vessels,â€” The relations of the ascending, transverse, and descend- ing portions of the aorta, must now be carefully studied. The aorta, it will be observed,* passes up in front of the root of the right lung, and descends behind the root of the left lung, whilst the transverse portion goes obliquely backwards. Its relations to the trachea and oesophagus must be re-studied, and likewise to the cardiac plexuses. From the arch, at its highest point, is seen to be given off the innominate artery, which will be seen to divide behind the right sterno-clavicular articulation into the carotid and subclavian, whilst, to the left of the innominate artery, the subclavian and carotid are

35 Chap. III.] JDlSSECTION OF THE A EM. Each muscle should be taken in its turn, and its origins and insertions (as far as possible at present) and its nerve supply should be made out. It should be clearly seen that the whole of the extensor muscles are supplied by the musculo-spiral nerve; in other words, that every muscle on the back or extensor surface of the arm is supplied by the musculo-spiral nerve. From the main nerve-trunk only three (triceps, supinator longus, and extensor carpi radialis longior) are supplied. The posterior interosseous nerve supplies all the rest. All the flexor muscles, those upon the front of the fore-arm and palm of the hand, are supplied by the median and ulnar nerves, which must be carefully dissected and their branches made out. In the fore-arm the ulnar nerve only supplies the flexor carpi ulnaris, and partially the flexor profundus digitorum, the two muscles between which it lies; all the rest are supplied by the median. Many of the flexor muscles arise by more than one head. These various origins are to be carefully made out and learnt. Before dis- secting the ulnar and radial arteries their branches should be learnt, and afterwards found. Unless this is done in the case of every artery, its branches are exceedingly likely to be severed from the main trunk. The branches wdiich arise from them high up enter into the anastomosis around the elbow-joint, which may now be made out. Anastomosis roimd elbow-Joint.â€”It has been remarked before that the arteries principally accompany the great nerves. The student should look for an artery running with the musculo-spiral nerve in front of the external intermuscular septum. This is the anterior branch of the superior pro- funda, and it should be followed down with the nerve until it anastomoses in front of the external condyle with the recurrent branch of the radial.

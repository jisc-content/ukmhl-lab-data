The nerve to the rhomboids from the brachial plexus and the posterior scapular artery run close together beneath these muscles, which they supply. When they have been found, the rhomboids and levator anguli scapulae may be divided near the scapula, and their course and distribution more clearly made out. Instead of dividing these muscles, it will be found an excellent plan to saw through the pos- terior edge of the scapula vertically. The cut should be about a quarter or half an inch from the poste- rior edge, and is intended to leave the strip of bone with the levator anguli scapulae, rhomboids, and the serratus magnus attached to it. Unless this is done it is not easy to get a proper idea of the relations of these muscles to the chest wall. The head and neck will have been dissected enough by this time to permit the arm to be removed from the body, and its dissection completed. Mem^val of arm from trunli.â€”The clavicle should be divided at its centre, and afterwards the pectoralis minor and subclavius divided. The ends of the clavicle may now be separated, and the brachial plexus and subclavian artery and vein more com- pletely dissected and learnt. When this has been done, the plexus and vessels should be cut through and tied to the clavicle; the omo-hyoid muscle, suprascapular artery and nerve, posterior scapular artery and nerve to rhomboids (if necessary), should be divided. The arm can now be removed from the trunk, leaving the muscles attached to the posterior border of the scapula upon the chest wall. The arm may now be laid upon the table, and dissected in the following order: Muscles of the shoulder, and Back of arm. Back of fore-arm. I Back of hand. i Ligaments and joints. 1

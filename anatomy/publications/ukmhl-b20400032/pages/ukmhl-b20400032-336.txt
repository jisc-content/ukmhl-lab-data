The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. xi. 322 I>issectioii of tSie aqueduct of Fstllopiiis. â€”Unless the bone has been soaked in acid, the re- maining part of the dissection will present many diffi- culties. Before beginning to cut the bone away, the course of the facial nerve should be made out upon the dry sections. A thick pig's-bristle can be intro- duced into any part of the Fallopian aqueduct. This canal begins at the bottom of the internal auditory meatus, and ends at the stylo-mastoid foramen. It contains the facial nerve, and at its termination may be said to contain the stapedius muscle and stylo- mastoid artery. The hiatus Fallopii opens into its commencement, after which it makes a curve round the front and outer side of the vestibule. Whilst making this curve, the canal is horizontal, and makes a ridge on the inner wall of the tympanum just above the fenestra ovalis. After passing over the fenestra ovalis, the aqueduct runs vertically downwards in the posterior wall of the tympanum, to reach the stylo- mastoid foramen. The dissection may be divided into two parts : (a) to expose the horizontal portion; {h) to expose the vertical. In order to keep the contents of the tympanum intact, and in order to see the stapedius favourably, this dissection may be done in the following manner : The triangular portion of petrous bone which lies between the internal auditory meatus, internally, and a line drawn from the hiatus Fallopii to the hiatus vestibuli, externally, is to be removed with a small saw or with the bone forceps. This lays bare the internal auditory meatus, vestibule, and commencement of the aque- duct of Fallopius. A little more of the aqueduct can be seen if, with the bone forceps, the bit of bone between the hiatus Fallopii and the tympanic cavity has been removed. When this has been done, the facial nerve is seen giving off the petrosal nerves, as it lies in the aqueduct opposite the hiatus Fallopii

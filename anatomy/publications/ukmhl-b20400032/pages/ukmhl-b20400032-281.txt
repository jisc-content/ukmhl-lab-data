Chap. IX.] Superior Carotid Triangle. 267 the upper posterior border of the hyoid bone. The course of the artery when inside the membrane will be studied later on, when the larynx is dissected. The sterno-mastoid branch should be traced into the sterno- mastoid muscle, passing over the upper part of the common carotid artery. The external laryngeal, or crico-thyroid artery, remains to be followed across the crico-thyroid membrane. The student is recommended not to endeavour to do too much at these small arteries lying upon firm textures, such as the crico- thyroid membrane. They only require to be defined by taking hold of the connective tissue near them; and as it is pulled away, delicate cuts should be made along the outline of the vessel, but without touching it. All of the arteries which have been dissected have corresponding veins, but owing to their smallness and their empty condition they will probably escape notice. Arising from the external carotid, opposite the cornu of the hyoid bone, are the lingual and facial arteries. At present these vessels should merely be traced : the lingual, until it disappears beneath the hyo-glossus ; the facial, until it passes beneath the posterior belly of the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles. The occipital artery, arising from the back of the external carotid, should be followed upwards as far as the posterior belly of the digastricus. The way in which the hypoglossal nerve winds round it should be noted, and care must be taken not to cut away its sterno-mastoid branch. This small artery enters the upper part of the sterno-mastoid muscle along with the spinal accessory nerve. When it has been found, this small artery serves as a guide to the nerve. At present only a small portion of the spinal accessory nerve can be seen emerging from beneath the digastricus and stylo-hyoid, but it should be sought for and traced into the deep surface of the sterno- mastoid muscle. The commencement of the internal

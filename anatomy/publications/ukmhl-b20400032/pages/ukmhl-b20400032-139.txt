Chap, v.] The External Oblique. 125 transversalis fascia by which it enters tlie abdominal canal is called the internal abdominal ring, but it is not nearly so well marked as the external, and may be easily overlooked. The opening in the abdominal muscles which the spermatic cord makes for itself is called the inguinal canal. It will be seen to be about an inch and a half in length, and to contain the spermatic cord, genito- crural, and ilio-inguinal nerves. The latter ought to have been found before this, and can be traced up to the transversalis muscle; the former enters the inguinal canal along with the spermatic vessels from the abdomen, and is often very difficult to find, as it is extremely variable in size. The dissection of the spermatic cord itself will be completed with that of the testicle. (Vide page 136.) The transversalis fascia has already been mentioned as overlying the epigastric artery. The student should trace it all over the front of the abdomen, and note that on its under-surface is a layer of fat (sub- peritoneal), which is of considerable importance surgically, as it enables the surgeon to know when he is close upon the peritoneum. If the epigastric artery be traced downwards it will be seen to come off from the external iliac, on its inner side usually; and just opposite to it on the outer side of the external iliac (sometimes arising as a common trunk with the epigastric) is another artery, the deep circumflex iliac. It should be traced by pushing and dissecting the peritoneum, from its surface to the anterior superior spine of the ilium, where it pierces the transversalis and internal oblique in an oblique direction, and then runs between them; and if pursued still farther, its anastomosis with the last lumbar artery can be seen, if it is injected. The peritoneum must be divided by similar

Chap. IX.] Base of Skull, 229 recommended to mark the proper position of each upon the skull which he has by him for reference. Occipital sinuses. The superior longitudinal sinus has already been opened and its contents displayed. A fine pair of scissors should be inserted into the inferior longi- tudinal sinus, which is situated at the lower border of the falx, just before this sinus joins the straight, and the canal opened from behind forwards. This incision may be continued backwards along one side of the junction of the tentorium cerebelli and falx cerebri, in order to open the straight sinus, which joins the inferior longitudinal with the torcular Herophilii. With a knife the lateral, petrosal, and occipital sinuses may be opened. The small transverse sinus joins the two inferior petrosal sinuses together, and crosses the basilar process a little behind where the sixth nerve pierces the dura mater. To find the sinus the dura mater should be probed with the point of the knife until the hollow of the sinus is felt. The circular sinus was destroyed in taking out the pituitary body; to display it properly a special dissection would be required. The small circular canal may be filled with injection from the cavernous sinus; a skull in which the pituitary body has not been removed should be chosen. The posterior clinoid processes having been removed with the bone forceps, the back part of the sinus comes into view. The front part may be seen by tracing the sinus round the pituitary body. The dissection of the cavernous sinus is very impor- tant, and before commencing it the small meningeal arteries should be sought for, and the remaining nerves displayed. Superior longitudinal.

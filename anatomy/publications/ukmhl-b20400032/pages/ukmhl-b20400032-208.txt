The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. vi. 194 a few days, so that it may macerate a little. In warm weather a week is not too long, whilst if the water is very cold it will bear at least a fortnight's maceration without any harm. It should be looked at every day or two, and the loose tissue removed, taking care not to injure that part where cartilages and sternum articulate. When the white glistening fibres that run across from the sternum to the cartilages begin to show themselves, the student will know that the time for dissection has arrived, and on cleaning off all the intervening tissue some fibres will be seen in front of and behind each articulation, which are called respectively the anterior and posterior costo-sternal. If slices of cartilage be taken from the back or front surface of the costal cartilages, where they abut upon the side of the sternum, the joints, surrounded by their capsular ligaments, will be laid open, and it will be seen that the joint belonging to the second cartilage, and often that also belonging to the third, is divided into two by an interarticular ligament. Excepting in children under puberty, it is difficult often to see these joints, and in old age they are almost invariably obliterated by the ossific union of the cartilages with the sternum. The lung-is.â€”Now that the anterior mediastinum is completed, the viscera of the thorax must be ex- amined in situ, and their position, which has hitherto been learnt from their surface markings, verified as far as possible. At any rate, there will be no difficulty in seeing that the lungs occupy the sides of the cavity, and that the left lung goes down farther than the right, owing to the diaphragm being pushed up by the liver on the right side. If the lungs are adherent to the chest-wall, at their apices or elsewhere, they must be carefully separated, either by working at the adhesion with the tips of the

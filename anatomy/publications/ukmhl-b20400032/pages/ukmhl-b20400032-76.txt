62 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iv. a small nerve, the anterior branch of the obturator. No further notice need be taken of it at present. This is a good opportunity to finish the verification of the coverings of femoral hernia. At the inner side of the femoral vein, if the student push his little finger under Poupart's ligament he can generally force a small hole into the abdominal cavity. If the abdomen is opened, he can put his hand on the opposite side into the abdominal cavity, and he will find there is nothing between his two fingers but some peritoneum and subperitoneal fat (septum crurale). This weak spot through which his little finger has penetrated is where a femoral hernia de- scends ; three of its coverings have already been verified before the fascia lata was removed, and, of the remaining three, the crural sheath has been broken through, and the subperitoneal fat and peritoneum are under his finger. When the student's finger has been passed into the hole on the inner side of the femoral vein, he will feel, below a piece of the bone, the ilio-pectineal line (in- ternally, a sharp edge (Gimbernat's ligament), above an edge not quite so sharp (Poupart's ligament), and externally, septum), that portion of the femoral sheath which separates his finger from the femoral vein. This aperture, the boundaries of which have just been enumerated, is termed the crural ring, and the continuation of the edges of this ring as far as the saphenous opening, which has been cut away during the dissection, is called the crural canal. The upper part of the crural ring is sometimes strengthened by a thickened fibrous band (part of the fascia transversalis) called the deep crural arch; Poupart's ligament is sometimes called the superficial crural arch. The crural sheath is formed by the protrusion of a portion of the fascia that lines the abdomen, in the shape of a funnel, the sheath at the apex of the

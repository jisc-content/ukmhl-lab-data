284 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. may be traced upwards between the internal jugular vein and carotid artery. There are usually said to be two ganglia upon it. The upper ganglion of Miiller is never seen upon an ordinary dissecting-room body; indeed, its very existence may be doubted. The lower ganglion (petrous ganglion, or ganglion of Andersch) lies in a slight depression on the petrous bone. It is often closely united to the superior ganglion of the pneumo-gastric, with which it always communicates. This ganglion often can hardly be said to exist. If the ridge of bone between the jugular fossa and the carotid canal be carefully cleaned, a small nerve (Jacobson's) may be followed from an aperture in it running to join the inferior ganglion of the glosso- pharyngeal. The remainder of its course will be seen later on. If the vagus be now traced upwards from its inferior ganglion, which has been already cleaned, a smaller and rounder swelling may generally be seen upon the nerve above it. This, which is the superior ganglion, or ganglion of the root, communicates with other nerves, especially the glosso-pharyngeal, but only gives off one small branch of distribution, called Arnold's nerve. This small twig may sometimes be found lying near the bone, and upon the back surface of the jugular vein, but much time need not be spent in trying to find it. Carotid caiisi,!,â€”The superior cervical ganglion of the sj^mpathetic has already been dissected, and its communications made out. The main trunk should now be followed up until it enters the bone with the internal carotid artery. To expose the carotid canal, its posterior wall should be cut away with bone forcej^s, and the artery followed into the skull, where it has been seen and cleaned. The sympathetic some- times has a ganglion (carotid ganglion) upon it, as it lies in the carotid canal, and usually sends a branch into the tympanum.

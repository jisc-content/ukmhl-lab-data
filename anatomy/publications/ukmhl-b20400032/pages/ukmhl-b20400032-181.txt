Chap, v.] Under Surface of Diaphragm. 167 Any connective tissue which remains after this is completed should be carefully dissected otf, in order to display the origin of its fibres from the cartilages of the ribs, and their insertion into its central tendon. The under surface of this part of the diaphragm must be carefully learnt, and the opening of the vena cava looked for. There will be no difficulty whatever in seeing in, or in passing a finger through it into the right auricle. In company with the dissection of the thorax, the diaphragm, together with any ribs that are in the way, must be removed as far back as the oesophageal opening. By this means the continuity of the stomach and oesophagus will be made quite clear, and the two vagi which have already been seen on the oesophagus should be followed down to the stomach. The left on the front of the stomach can be traced by careful dissection as far as the beginning of the duodenum, and the right into the solar plexus. The stomach, duodenum, and spleen should now be removed by severing the oesophagus just above the cardiac orifice. When this is done, the stomach and duodenum must be opened, so as to dissect their mucous, muscular, and peritoneal coats, precisely in the same manner as this was performed in the rest of the intestines, taking care to observe the longitudinal muscular fibres along the greater and lesser curvatures of the stomach, and the presence of villi and valvula3 conniventes in the duodenum. When the stomach mucous membrane has been stripped off, the oblique fibres of the stomach which are the most internal will be exposed. Do not omit to examine the pylorus, and to see the thickening of the coats at this point, and the narrowing of its calibre, giving rise to a sort of valve.

Chap, v.] Side View of Pelvis. genito-crural nerves have been traced to tlieir ultimate distribution, the whole length of the external cutaneous, anterior crural, and probably the obturator nerves, will be brought into view, together with the psoas and iliacus muscles, and the exact origin of the pectineus. SIDE VIEW OP THE PELVIS. List of Structures to he Dissected. Kemoval of leg from trunk. Distension of "bladder, vagina, and rectum. The pelvic fascia. Folds of peritoneum. Ilelations of viscera to peri- toneum and fascia. Course of vessels and nerves to the various viscera. Removal of viscera and their dissection. Dissection of sacral plexus and sympathetic ganglia in pelvis. The cavity of the true pelvis, its muscles, vessels, and nerves. When all the dissection of the abaomen is com- pleted, the pelvis may be begun. In order to get at it satisfactorily, one leg, with the corresponding in- nominate bone, must be removed. The left leg is usually taken away. To remove tlie Beft leg* and iiniomiiiate l^one, the following incisions should be made. A big and strong knife should be employed, and it will run very considerable risk of being blunted before the leg is separated. The knife should be carried from the anterior superior spine round the crest of the ileum, keeping close to it, and removing all the re- mains of the abdominal muscles from it. The peri- toneum must be completely raised from the left side of the pelvic cavity, from the symphysis in front to the sacro-iliac synchondrosis behind, but not taken away. The pubes should be sawn across, about half an inch to the left side of the symphysis, care being taken to ensure that the saw does not injure the struc- tures behind the pubes. Very often when this is

Chap. XIV.] Fissures and Convolutions, 349 convolution above the gyrus fornicatus, and near the margin of the hemisphere, is called the marginal, and the fissure between the marginal and callosal convolu- tions is named the calloso-marginal fissure.^ If the student now turns his attention to the wedge-shaped lobe, the fissures which bound the wedge will of course be found to converge in front until they form one fissure. This single fissure is continued on for a little distance, and is called the calcarine. A little below the calcarine fissure is another, of considerable size, running parallel to it, called the collateral. These fissures are important, because later on they can be seen to dip so far into the interior of the brain that they make hills in the interior of the ventricles, called the calcar, or hippocampus minor, in the case of the calcarine fissure, and collateral eminence in the case of the collateral fissure. The collateral fissure is not always easy to find, but the rule that it is the next large fissure below the calcarine generally holds good. If the gyrus fornicatus be traced round the posterior margin of the corpus callosum, towards the end of temporo-sphenoidal lobe, it will be found to end in a little hook, which is called the crochet. The convolu- tion which runs directly backwards from the crochet, and which lies about the collateral fissure, is sometimes called the uncinate. Lastly, the convolutions upon the under surface of the temporo-sphenoidal lobes re- main to be examined. And it will be seen that there is no well-marked line of separation between the under surface of this lobe and the occipital. The student should refer to his text-books of descriptive anatomy for fuller information concerning the con- volutions. The brain still lying with its base upon the table, the great longitudinal fissure should be gently separated * The remaining fissures and convolutions cannot be seen unless a separate cerebral hemisphere is obtained.

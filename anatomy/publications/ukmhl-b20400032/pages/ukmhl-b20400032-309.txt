Chap. IX.] Larynx AND Pharynx. 295 necessary to divide all the structures in front of the lower cervical spine about an inch above the sternum. The muscles and veins in front of the trachea may be divided first. They are the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and inferior thyroid veins. The common carotid artery, internal jugular veins, and pneumo-gastric, sympathetic, and cardiac nerves, should be cub through at the same level. Next, the inferior thyroid arteries and veins, and recurrent laryngeal nerves should be severed. All the parts which have been divided may now be pulled well away from the spine, and the occipital arteries divided about half an inch from tlie external ear. Still pulling the larynx and pharynx and other structures forwards, the communications of the cervi- cal plexus with the cranial and sympathetic nerves should be divided. Afterwards the hypoglossals may be cut through close to the anterior condyloid fora- men, and the cellular tissue, which is found between the vertebral column and the back of the pharynx, torn through with the back of the knife and hnger of the dissector. Near the base of the skull it may be difficult to keep all the great nerves and veins upon the anterior portion; but wherever they are not separated from the posterior portion, the knife may be brought into careful use. The larynx, etc., should now be drawn strongly forward over the face, and the handle of the knife pushed upwards behind the median raphe of the pharynx, until the basilar process is almost exposed. The next step is to divide the basilar process, and this may be done in the following way. The remains of the body may be inverted, so that the upper surface of the base of the skull rests upon the floor. A broad chisel, such as was used for opening the skull, should be pushed against the back part of the basilar process, and pointed a little backwards. A blow with a

The Tongue. Chap. X.] 313 hyoid bone below and to the epiglottis behind. The following points require to be made out: The giosso-epiglottidean folds are three small pro- cesses of mucous membrane, which fasten the tongue to the sides and front of the epiglottis. The smallest and most numerous of the delicate elevations which cover the tongue are called filiform papillae. Scat- tered amongst them are some slightly larger, like small mushrooms, called the fungiform. At the back of the tongue are about half a dozen larger and flatter elevations called the circumvallate papillae. They are arranged like the letter Y. Where they diverge there is a pit in the mucous membrane (foramen caecum). All the nerves which supply the tongue have been found, and only require to be traced to their ultimate destinations. The hypoglossal ends amongst the ex- trinsic muscles. The glosso-pharyngeal may be traced under the hyo-glossus to the mucous membrane of the dorsum of the tongue behind the circumvallate papillae. The lingual nerve (gustatory) should be dissected to the mucous membrane of the tip and sides. The lin- gual artery has been almost altogether dissected. Its terminal branch (the ranine) may be followed almost to the tip by simply dissecting off the mucous membrane. It is accompanied by a vein already traced over the hyo-glossus. The remaining artery of the tongue , (dorsalis linguae) may be traced to the dorsum of the tongue by cutting through more of the attachment of the hyo-glossus. The attachment of the hyo- glossus to the tongue separates two muscles which run along the under surface ; these are the stylo-glossus and lingualis. Both have been partially seen.

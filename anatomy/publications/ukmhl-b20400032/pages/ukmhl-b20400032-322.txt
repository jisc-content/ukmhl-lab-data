3o8 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. x. whilst rotation in the contrary direction will cause their approximation. This approximation and diver- gence of the vocal cords is generally spoken of as closing and opening the glottis (or slit between the true vocal cords). The student must bear in mind that all the muscles which he is about to dissect are concerned in producing one of the following four movements : (1) Making the vocal cords tense. (2) E-elaxing the vocal cords. (3) Approximating the vocal cords. (4) Causing the vocal cords to diverge. The movements of the arytenoid cartilages will be better understood by referring to Fig. 40 on the previous page. The axis of rotation of the arytenoid is supposed to be represented by a vertical line, which is seen in section at o. It will be readily understood that tension along the lines A B will produce an approxi- mation of the vocal cords, whilst tension along the lines B c will give rise to their divergence. DISSECTION OF THE LARYNX. The following structures will be met with in the dissection of the larynx : Muscles: Crico-thyroid. Arytsenoideus. Crico - arytaenoideus posti- cus. Crico - arytsenoideus later- alis. Thyro-aryt^noideus. Aryteno - epiglottideus su- perior. Aryteno - epiglottideus in- ferior. Thyro-epiglottideus. Vessels : Superior laryngeal artery and vein. Nerves : Superior and inferior (re- current) laryngeal nerves. Ligaments : Three crico-tkyroid. Three crico-arytenoid. Three thyro-hyoid. One thyro-epiglottic. One hyo-epiglottic.

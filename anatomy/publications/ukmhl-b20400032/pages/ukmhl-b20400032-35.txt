Chap. III.] Dissection of the Arm. 21 therefore radiate from the nipple. The arteries wliich supply the gland principally descend into it from above. One (the long thoracic) should be sought for entering the gland from beneath the axillary edge of pectoralis major, others piercing the intercostal spaces in front, coming from the internal mammary artery; others enter the under-surface of the gland, and come from the intercostals. The surface of the pectoralis major may now be cleaned from origin to insertion, the mammary gland being taken completely away. The cutaneous vessels and nerves should be preserved as far as possible. It will be found best never to cut any thing away until absolutely obliged. If the different structures are preserved and frequently looked at, they become impressed upon the memory in a short time, and almost unconsciously. In order to clean the pector- alis major, the fascia which covers it should be seized at its axillary border, and a cut made through it well into the muscular fibres. The cut edge should be drawn firmly upwards, and the delicate fibrous septa which the fascia sends between the muscle bundles should be followed a little way into the muscle sub- stance and divided. All cuts should be made with the blade of the knife, and in the direction of the fibres, and the fascia removed, as far as possible, in one piece. As all muscles require to be dissected in a similar way, these directions will not be repeated. As the insertion of the muscle is approached, caution must be exercised, and the fibres traced only as far as the margin of the deltoid. The upper edge of the muscle is separated from the deltoid by an interval containing a vein and artery (cephalic vein and thoracica-humeraria artery). The vein and artery may be seen most easily presently, but as the vein in its empty condition is small and collapsed, it is in danger of division unless looked for.

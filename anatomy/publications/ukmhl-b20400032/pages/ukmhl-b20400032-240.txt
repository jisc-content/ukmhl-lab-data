2 2 6 The Dissector \s Ma nua l. [Chap. v n i. groove on tlie posterior clinoid process); the seventh pair of nerves is farther out, entering the internal auditory meatus. The auditory artery, a branch of the basilar^ enters with the nerves, and will aid in distinguishing them. The artery requires to be cut through as well as the nerves. At the lower and back border of the petrous bone the eighth pair of nerves come into view. The student is not able to distinguish each division (pneumogastric, glosso- pharyngeal, and spinal accessory) separately, but the spinal portion of the latter nerve can be seen coming up through the foramen magnum, and will serve as a guide to the other nerves. A bony eminence (the eminentia innominata) at each side of the foramen magnum has beneath it the ninth nerve, hypoglossal. Observe that this nerve leaves the dura mater in two bundles, which are separated by about a quarter of an inch of the membrane. The tips of the fingers should next be placed beneath the front of the cere- bellum, so that the medulla oblongata, which connects the brain with the spinal cord, is between the ring and middle finger. The last step of the operation remains. This is to divide the vertebral arteries and medulla oblongata. No difficulty will be experienced in dividing the first. To divide the latter, hold the knife as near the handle end as possible, push it into the foramen magnum by the side of the medulla, and cut it across just below the foramen. Nothing now remains but to remove the brain, and place it in a suitable hardening medium. Ha.rdeiniiig' tlie torain.â€”Before placing the brain in a hardening solution, it is necessary to remove the pia mater, which is the vascular membrane covering the surface of the organ. [Jnless the pia mater be carefully removed, the spirit will fail to harden the brain efficiently. To remove the mem- brane will, of course, entail the destruction of the

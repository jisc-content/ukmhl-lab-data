28o The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. stylo-pharyngeus, and lying upon the side of the pharynx is a meshwork of nerves, called the pharyn- geal plexus. A branch given off from the trunk of the glosso-pharyngeal may be traced into it, and presently branches from the vagus and sympathetic. ISTo very explicit rule can be laid down for finding the pharyngeal branch of the glosso-pharyngeal; but by beginning to clean the glosso-pharyngeal near the base of the skull, and gently pulling on the main trunk, the branches which have been mentioned can be seen. The trunk of the vagus may now be cleaned. Its communications with the cervical nerves, sympathetic, glosso-pharyngeal, and spinal accessory, are to Vje made out, but the two last-named communications â€¢ must be left until the ganglia of the glosso-pharyngeal and the superior ganglion of the vagus are begun. At present the two large branches which come from the ganglion of the trunk, or lower ganglion of the vagus, may be traced. The pharyngeal branch has been already mentioned. It may be found given otF from the middle of the ganglion, and traced either over or under the internal carotid to the plexus beneath the stylo-pharyngeus. The laryngeal branch is of considerable size, and is usually given off from the lowest part of the ganglion of the trunk. It should be t-''*^ced downwards between the pharynx and in- ternal carotid, whilst it will be found to divide into a branch which has been already seen entering the larynx, and another branch which has been seen running with the superior thyroid artery. This latter is the external laryngeal nerve. It is usually rather delicate, but, with a little skill, may be followed beneath the depressor muscles of the hyoid bone into the crico-thyroid muscle. In a favourable subject, by beginning to dissect the nerve from its origin, where it is strong and thick, slender branches can be traced from it into the thyroid body, inferior constrictor

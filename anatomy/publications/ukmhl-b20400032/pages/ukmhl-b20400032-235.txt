221 Chap. viL] Removal of Skull-Cap, behind the orbit, should be sought for between its layers; the orbital branch of the temporal artery is near the nerve, but is sometimes absent. Having removed the temporal fascia, clean the muscle beneath it as far down as is possible. Removal of tlie skull-cap.—In order to remove the brain, the skull-cap is next to be taken off. With a strong knife divide firmly all the struc- tures down to the bone which are crossed, by a cir- cular incision drawn an inch above the external angle of the frontal bone, the pinna of the ears and mastoid process, as far back as the external occipital protu- berance. The student n should obtain a rough \ / cloth to place over the cranium. It is not easy to steady the skull for sawing, with the naked hand. A strong and sharp saw should be pro- cured, and a hammer and chisel. The latter should be made with a cross-bar, to enable it to be used as a wrench (Fig. 30). The outer table of the skull should be sawn through. It may be known when this is accomplished by thfe red moist sawdust which comes from the dijplbe. As the diploe contains blood-vessels, in the case of the living subject blood would be seen when the diploe was reached. The amount of diploe to be sawn through varies greatly in different skulls. In children it is absent; it becomes more abundant as age advances. The greatest care should now be taken in sawing through the inner table. The saw may be applied very freely over the angular processes of the frontal bone, and at the occipital protuberance. In other parts the greatest Fig. 30.—Wrench or Elevator.

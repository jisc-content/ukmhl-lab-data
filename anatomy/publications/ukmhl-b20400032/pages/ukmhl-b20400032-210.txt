[Chap. VI. The Dissector's Manual. 196 pericardium there is no distinct boundary line to sepa- rate it from the middle mediastinum. A similar fact was noted about the anterior mediastinum ; hence this upper part of the three mediastina has been described by some authors as a " superior mediastinum. That part of the pleural cavity where the student's fingers were brought to a standstill is the line of union between the parietal and visceral layers of the pleura, and an incision along the side of the vertebrse at this point will open the posterior mediastinum, and expose its contents. Before making this incision, the process of pleura which attaches the inner and back aspect of the lung to the diaphragm must be looked for. It is about four inches long, and extends from the root of the lung to the diaphragm. It is called the ligamentum latum pulmonis, and cannot possibly be mistaken. The student must not fail to observe that there is no similar ligament above the roots of the lungs, owing to the fact that the vena azygos major winds round the upper edge of the right root, and the aorta round the left. When this portion of the dissection is completed, the lungs can be cut away, about two inches from their roots. It is necessary to leave about two inches, so as not to destroy the pulmonary plexuses, but advis able to remove the rest, as they only add to the diffi- culties and discomfort of the dissector, and so are better out of the way. If a sponge and some clean water be employed at this stage, it will materially aid the remainder of the dissection. THE POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM. Contents. Aorta. OEsophagus and vagi. Splanchnic nerves.

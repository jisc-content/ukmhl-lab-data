241 Chap. IX.] Ocular Appendages. The inner edge of the palpebral portion is sometimes called ciliary, but is so pale in colour, and its fibres are so delicate, that considerable skill will be required to display them. The orbicular muscle may now be cleaned by dissecting circularly round the eyes. At the inner canthus the fibres are seen attached to a small tendon, the tendo oculi, which fastens the tarsal cartilages to the nasal process of the superior maxilla. The student should study upon his own face the little lump which indicates its presence. There is a similar band of fibres externally, fastening the tarsal carti- lages to the malar bone, but being few in number they are easily overlooked. An incision may now be made through the lower lid into the orbit, in order to expose from in front a muscle, the inferior oblique, which has been already seen. It lies just within, and parallel to, the lower margin of the orbit. There is a small muscle attached to the tarsal car- tilages, called the tensor tarsi, or Horner's muscle. It is situated at the inner end of the tarsal carti- lages, and close to their internal surface. In order to expose it, the mucous membrane requires to be removed from its surface. To do this, the upper and lower lids are to be divided by a vertical incision about their centre, and their inner ends pulled forwards and inwards with hooks. The con- junctiva is to be removed with care, by beginning Q Fig. 34.â€”Tensor Tarsi seen from behind.

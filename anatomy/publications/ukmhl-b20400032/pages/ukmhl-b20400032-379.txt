3^5 Chsp. XV.] Spinal Cord. the ileum. This ligament (ilio-lumbar) corresponds to the middle costo-trans verse, and was divided when the ileum was removed to make a side view of the pelvis. (F^c/epage 175.) The remaining ligaments will be dissected after the spinal cord. Dissection of tlie spinal cord.â€”With a saw, and bone forceps, the spinal canal should be opened from behind throughout its whole length. Above, the posterior arch of the atlas should be cut through at each side, afterwards the laminae of all the A^ertebrse as far outwards as possible. The sacral canal must also be opened. The principal contents of the spinal canal which require dissection are : The membranes and sub- I Spinal cord and roots of nerves, arachnoid space. | Spinal nerves (ganglia). Afterwards, the posterior common ligaments and the ligaments which connect the spine to the skull. In removing the back of the canal in the dorsal region, an attempt should be made to remove a few of the laminae intact, in order to be able to examine the ligamenta subflava. To accomplish this, the vertebral extremity of the rib should be removed, and the pedicle of the vertebrae divided with the bone forceps. The laminae and spines can now be detached, and internal surface of the ligaments cleaned. When the skull was dissected, its dura mater was seen to form a periosteum for the bones, to send septa into the brain, and form sinuses for the blood. The dura mater, or theca, of the cord does none of these things, but simply forms a sac for the cord. This sac is capacious above, narrow in the dorsal, and very capacious in the lumbar and sacral regions. Above, it is attached to the margins of the foramen mag- num; below, it ends in a pointed extremity, which is fastened to the bottom of the sacral canal. A number of veins (meningo-rachidian) and quantity of

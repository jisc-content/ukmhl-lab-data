PREFACE. In this Manual we have endeavoured, as far as possible, to describe the way in which the structures that go to make up the body can be displayed. It is intended that the student should rely on the ordinary text-books of descriptive anatomy for a full account of them, but occasionally it has been found impossible to avoid brief descriptions. We have described far more fully than is usually done how to find the various structures, and we have endeavoured to state clearly what the student may expect to see, and what he must either take for granted or use special modes of preparation to de- monstrate. No apology is needed for doing so. If any branch of medical study is capable of accurate and exact demonstration, it is anatomy, ajid the student ought clearly to understand that if much is conjectural in physiology or medicine, this is not tlie case at least with naked-eye anatomy.

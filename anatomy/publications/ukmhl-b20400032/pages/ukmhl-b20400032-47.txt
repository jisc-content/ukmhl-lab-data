Dissection of the Arm, Chap. III.] 33 artery. A line drawn from the middle of the bend of the elbow to the pisiform bone marks the course of the ulnar artery. This line should curve well towards the ulnar side of the arm until it meets the line of the ulnar nerve, at the junction of the upper with the middle-third of the fore-arm. The line of the nerve and artery afterwards coincide. The skin should be removed from the front of the bend of the elbow and of the fore-arm by the following incisions : (a) a circular incision at the level of the styloid processes of the radius and ulna; {h) a longitudinal incision in the line of the median nerve, The skin having been reflected well towards the radial and ulnar sides of the fore-arm, the internal and external cutaneous nerves should be followed down from the arm, and the cutaneous veins made out. The nerves at the upper part of the arm, as a rule, lie beneath the veins. The tendon of the biceps should be cleaned, and its semilunar expansion to the fascia of the fore-arm preserved. The median basilic vein usually lies upon this expansion, and is separated by it from the brachial artery. The deep fascia may be removed, and the bend of the elbow dissected. The boundaries of this space should first be made out, and afterwards its contents. The muscles attached to the supinator ridge, and to the front of the inner condyle, are first to be cleaned. The median nerve and brachial artery should next be traced, the artery until its division into radial and ulnar. The supinator longus should next be drawn to- wards the radial side of the arm with hooks, and the musculo-spiral nerve searched for, lying between it and the brachialis anticus, and piercing the external intermuscular septum. The external intermuscular septum is a strong layer of fascia prolonged from the deep fascia of the arm to the whole length of the ex- ternal condylar ridge. It serves for the attachment D

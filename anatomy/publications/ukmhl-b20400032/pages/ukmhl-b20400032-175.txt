Chap, v.] Duodenum and Stomach. i6i bowel; and entering the common bile duct near its end lie "will find the pancreatic duct which runs in the substance of the gland and should be traced towards the left by cutting it away. The relations of these structures, and of the portal vein and arteries of this region, may be rendered clearer by the diagram (Fig. 23). The left end of the pancreas will still be covered with peritoneum, which must be dissected ojBP. As the student gradually uncovers it, he will also uncover^ just above it, the tortuous splenic artery, giving otf some small branches (pancreaticse parvse) to the pancreas. As this artery is traced on towards the left, the spleen will be reached, and the vasa brevia will be exposed going from the splenic artery to the stomach, the posterior layer of the gastro-splenic omentum having been just removed. If the student is in any difficulty about this artery, he may be assisted by reference to the transverse section of the peritoneum through the foramen of Winslow. (Vide page 147.) Passing upwards (in this position of the body) from the splenic artery, the gastro-epiploica sinistra artery can be traced along the greater curvature, to anastomose with the gastro-epiploica dextra from the hepatic, which will be dissected later on. The splenic artery should next be traced back- wards to the coeliac axis, more peritoneum (back wall of lesser sac) being removed to expose it. The gastric (coronary) artery may be felt towards the highest part of the lesser sac, curving round its left side to get to / the oesophageal end of the stomach ; after arriving at this point it gets between the layers of tlie lesser omentum, and runs along the lesser curvature of the stomach to anastomose with the pyloric branch of the hepatic. The hepatic may be felt winding round the right side of the lesser sac, and below the foramen of L

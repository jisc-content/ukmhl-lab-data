176 The Dissector's AIanual. [Chap. v. accomplished, the innominate bone can be separated at the synchondrosis by placing one hand on each iliac crest, and using considerable force. If it does yield, the knife should be employed to divide, at the level of the brim of the true pelvis, the common and internal iliac artery and veins with the ureter, the psoas, and anterior crural nerve. The rectum must be separated from the synchon- drosis and turned over towards the middle line, after which any other structures that cover up the articu- lation must be cut through. The saw should then be applied with great care to the region of the synchondrosis, until it is so far cut through that it can be easily broken. This will allow the left innominate bone to be readily turned outwards. As this is done the fascia should be cut from the upper and lower margins of the pelvis, and detached by pushing the handle of the knife between it and the obturator internus. This will partially expose the levator ani, running from the ischial spine to the back of the pubes. The tip of the ischial spine should be cut off with the saw or bone forceps, and left with the parts attached to it. Just above the ischial spine, and coming through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, the pyriformis muscle and the gluteal and sciatic vessels and nerves must be severed as they pass through the foramen. The structures which pass through the lesser sciatic notch should be preserved. The division of the great sacro- sciatic ligament close to the ischial tuberosity will complete the separation. The dissection of the innominate bone which has been removed belongs to the leg.

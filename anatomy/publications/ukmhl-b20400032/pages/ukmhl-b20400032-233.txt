The Scalp. 219 Chap. VII.J connective - tissue surroundings touched. The other nerves should be carefully sought for in the following places : The temporal bra.nch, of the temporo-Tnalar^ nerve will be found about an inch above the zygoma, andean inch behind the external angle of the frontaT bone. Tfc lies at first beneath the orbicularis palpebra- rum, crossing almost parallel to the margin of the orbit, and not, like the other cutaneous nerves, towards the vertex of the scalp. The temporal fascia should next be cleaned. Usually an aperture can be discovered, giving passage to the small temporo-malar nerve. The auriculo-temporal branch of the fifth must be found beMiad-andJ^eneath tlie, temp.QraI^,rtPiry. It will be found best to begin the dissection for finding it, near the tubercle of the zygoma. The posterior auricular branch of the facial is found running with the corre- sponding artery beneath the retrahens aurem muscle. The lesser occij)ital runs up the scalp exactly at the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid. The giie^^t occipital nerve is close to the occipital artery, and lies midway between the occipital protuberance and the mastoid process.„ _ The__Suboccipitai^ terior branch of the third cervical nerve sometimes supply the scalp, but are seldom made out. Muscles of scaSp.—The chief muscle of this region is the occipito-frontalis ; it belongs to the same order of muscles as the platysma. The dissection should be begun in front by completely cleaning the upper fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum. The fron- talis will be found blending with them. The central fibres of the frontalis may afterwards be traced down the nose, going to form the pyramidalis nasi. If the upper border of the orbicularis oculi be dissected from the skull, a few muscular fibres can be traced, from an attachment to the frontal bone, radiating outwards into the orbicularis; this is the corrugator supercilii. The fat and subcutaneous tissue of the scalp being gradually

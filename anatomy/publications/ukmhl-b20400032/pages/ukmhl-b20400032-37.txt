Chap. III.] Dissection of the Arm. 23 The ascending branch (acromial-thoracic) runs over the coracoid process towards the acromion. The transverse branch (thoracica-humeraria) descends in the interval between the deltoid and pectoralis major with the cephalic vein. The descending branch (short thoracic, or superior thoracic) descends between the pectoralis major and minor to supply them. All these arteries should be found and traced as far as the membrane. A nerve (the external anterior thoracic) should be looked for running close to the superior thor- acic artery, and entering the posterior surface of the pectoralis major. The cosfco-coracoid membrane should be gradually dissected away, and the nerve followed over the axillary vein and artery to join the outer cord of the brachial plexus. As the membrane is gradually cut away, a nerve (the internal anterior thoracic) which emerges between the axillary artery and vein, and descends to enter the inner surface of the pectoralis minor, should be looked for and preserved. It will afterwards be seen to come from the inner cord of the brachial plexus. After supplying the pectoralis minor it usually ends in the major.

It descends beneath the clavicle and pectoralis major and minor into the arm- pit, and runs down the arm to the bend of the elbow under the name of brachial. The student should learn, concerning the axillary artery, the places where it begins and where it ends; its course and its branches, and its relations. The beginning and ending

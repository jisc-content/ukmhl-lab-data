Ligamentum nucha3. Spines of dorsal and lumbar vertebrse. Iliac crests. Erector spinte. Trapezius. Latissimus dorsi. Spine and angles of scapula. The dissection of the head and neck and abdomen will have, in addition, the surface markings of tbe Lungs. I Kidneys ; and Liver. | Colon, right and left. (For these latter surface-markings refer to page 285 and to Frontispiece.) Although not strictly belonging to the arm, the student may see what tbese surface markings ought to be. By remembering and examining the attachments of the muscles to the bones, the student should not experience any difficulty in ascertaining their proper relation to the skin. In the living subject they should be put in action, to show their outlines properly. The skin incisions which are requisite to expose the muscles of the back, are : (a) From external occipital protuberance down to the sacrum; (6) from the acromion process as far as twelfth dorsal spine ; (c) round the iliac crests ; (d) (if not already made) an incision along the anterior border of the trapezius. The skin ilaps should be reflected, and in the sub- cutaneous tissue, which is usually abundant, cutaneous nerves should be traced, coming from the posterior branches of the dorsal and cervical nerves. The acro- mial branches of the superficial cervical plexus, and the posterior branches from the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves, should also be sought for. These nerves have already been seen winding backwards round the border of the latissimus

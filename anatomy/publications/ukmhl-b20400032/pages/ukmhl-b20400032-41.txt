Chap, in.] Dissection of the Arm. 27 are very numerous, and are chiefly in its apex and beneath its anterior border, where they receive the lymphatics from the mamma. They shoukl be re- moved one by one. To remove them they should be seized and pulled upon with the forceps \ as they are dragged out, their connective tissue and fat should be divided quite close to their capsule, and the gland isolated, until it remains attached by its blood-vessels. When it has been seen whence its blood-supply is derived, the gland should be removed. The axillary lymphatic glands derive their blood-supply from an artery called the alar thoracic. The long thoracic artery should be traced downwards beneath the anterior boundary, towards the mammary gland, and upwards until it is lost beneath the pectoralis minor. The subscapular artery is to be found running down the posterior boundary of the space. In the centre, close to the chest-wall, lies the nerve of Bell. In order to trace these structures up to their origin, the pectoralis major should be divided about two inches from its insertion, and the ends turned inwards and outwards. The whole of the pectoralis minor may now be cleaned, and the apex of the axilla made out. The different cords of the brachial plexus can be partially dissected where they are in relation with the axillary artery; but the highest part of the plexus lies in the neck and beneath the clavicle. It should be left until the posterior triangle of the neck has been dissected sufficiently to enable the bone to be divided, and the nerve tissues followed upwards. The student should consult his text-book for a full account of the brachial plexus. The axillary artery will have been brought into view by the time the plexus is finished ; its remaining branches, anterior and posterior circumflex and sub- scapular, should be made out one by ona As the subscapular is cleaned, it will be seen shortly after its

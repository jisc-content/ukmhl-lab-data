285 Chap. IX.] The Back. I>is§ectio]i ©f the toaclt.—When the back is dissected particular attention should be given to the following points : Surface markings. Back of neck. Cutaneous nerve-supply. Muscles of back (deep). Attachments of superficial Structures between last rib muscles. and crest of ileum. Suboccipital triangle, and The surface markings are comparatively simple, and include Occipital protuberance, and superior curved line of occipital bone. Spines of vertebrjB and ribs. Spine and outline of scapula. Crest of ileum. Outlines of latissimus dorsi, and Trapezius and erector spime. Outlines of lungs and liver. Kidneys. Ascending and descending colon. Most of these require no further mention. The lungs and liver have been shown elsewhere. (Vide frontispiece.) The kidneys should be marked in, so that their hilum is about opposite the tirst lumbar spine, and about two inches external to it. The upper border of the right kidney reaches as high as the lower border of the eleventh rib. Below, it nearly reaches the ileum. The left kidney is not so low. It reaches the lower border of the tenth rib, and does not extend quite so near the ileum as the right. (Vide Fig. 13.) The right and left colons lie beneath a line drawn ver- tically upwards from a point midway between the anterior and posterior superior spines of the ileum. In most dissecting-rooms the superficial muscles of the back are dissected with, the arm. They include Trapezius. I Ebomboids. Latissimus dorsi. | Levator anguli scapulae. All of them are muscles acting on the scapula. The method of exposing them has already been described with the arm, and as in removing the upper

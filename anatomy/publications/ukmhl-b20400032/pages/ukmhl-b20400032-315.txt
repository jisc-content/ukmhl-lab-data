301 Chap. X.] The Pharynx. fibres, for underlying them will be seen a dense fibrous membrane, which is more abundant at the upper part of the pharynx, and can be very clearly seen through the sinus of Morgagni attaching the pharynx to the base of the skull, so that it is evident that it is only the muscular wall of the pharynx which is absent at the sinus of Morgagni, and not the fibrous or mucous layers. Next, remove the muscular fibres from the pharynx, and display the fibrous membrane (the pharyngeal aponeurosis). When its attachments have been made out, it must be divided down the middle line along with its subjacent mucous membrane. The inside of the pharynx will then be displayed, and the tow which is contained in its interior must be all removed. The arteries which supply the pharynx, viz., the ascending palatine, tonsilar, and ascending pharyngeal, must next be traced to their destination. They have already been seen and dissected at their starting- points. The ascending palatine, if injected, will be easily traced upwards, passing between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus. After sending some branches to all the parts with which it is in contact, two larger branches can be traced; one perforates the superior constrictor to reach the tonsil, whilst the other is continued up to the sinus of Morgagni at the upper border of the superior constrictor, and, accompanying the levator palati, will be seen inside the pharynx to enter the soft palate. This and the succeeding branches can usually be seen under the mucous mem- brane of the pharynx before it is removed. The tonsilar branch can be traced up to perforate the superior constrictor, and supply the tonsils. The ascending pharyngeal, coming ofi" from the back of the external carotid, lies on the side of the pharynx, and, supplying all the muscles of the pharynx

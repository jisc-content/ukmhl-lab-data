If not already sufficiently exposed, the transverse facial artery should be made out, running below and parallel to the zygoma and the auricular parotidian, and deep temporal branches of the tem- poral artery sought for and cleaned. The buccinator muscle is now to be finished, but in cleaning out the buccal fat, which lies beneath the front edge of the masseter, care must be taken not to injure the buccal branch of the fifth, which lies beneath the fat, close to the muscle. The nerve is accom- panied by a small artery. The muscle should be cleaned from origin to insertion. It may be noticed that Stenson's duct pierces it opposite the second upper malar tooth. There is a papilla at the orifice, which is easy to feel in one's own mouth. A probe should be passed into the mouth from the duct. The sewing of the mouth may now be undone, and the lips everted in, order to clean the coronary arteries. In doing this, the mucous membrane and labial mucous glands require removal. The lower lip should be well pulled down, in order to see a band, about half an inch wide, which stands out beneath the mucous membrane. This is the small quadratus menti muscle. The mucous membrane should be removed from it. The mouth being open, this is a favourable oppor- tunity to see the elevations of the sublingual glands beneath the tongue, also the frcenum of the tongue and the papillae, which indicate the position of Wharton's ducts. There is a small aperture at the top of each sublingual papilla, which permits a fine probe to be introduced into the ducts. These parts may be studied very easily on the student's own body.

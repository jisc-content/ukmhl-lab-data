Chap. X.] The Larynx. The arytsenoideus is supplied by both superior and inferior laryngeal nerves, which effect a junction in its substance ; but this can rarely, if ever, be traced in a dissecting-room body. In a carefully-prepared and hardened larynx, a skilful dissector will make out three communications between the superior and inferior laryngeal nerves. (1) In the arytsenoideus. (2) On the back of the cricoid cartilage, super- ficial to the muscles. (3) Immediately beneath the ala of the thyroid cartilage. l^igameiats of larynx.â€”If the crico-thyroid membrane be traced upwards, on the side of the larynx from which one-half of the thyroid cartilage has been removed, it will be found, when the thyro-arytsenoideus is cut away from its outer surface, to become con- tinous with the true vocal cords, and to be attached only just in front to the thyroid cartilage. That it is not attached to the side of the thyroid can be readily proved, by pushing the handle of the knife between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages on the side where the thyroid cartilage remains intact. Behind, at the inferior angle, where the thyroid touches the cricoid, there will be seen to be a smooth facet on the cricoid on that side where the thyroid is removed. If the thyroid cartilage be bent over towards the other side, and a little cleaning effected where it articulates with the cricoid, a capsular ligament will be made out, and when cut into will display the joint. By divesting the arytenoid cartilage of all muscle and connective tissue, and moving it about with the forceps, the loose capsular ligament which attaches it to the cricoid will be readily seen, and should be opened. On its back surface the capsule has a fibrous thickening, which sometimes is spoken of as a separate ligament.

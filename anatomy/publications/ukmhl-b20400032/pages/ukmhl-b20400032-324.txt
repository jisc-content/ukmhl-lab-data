3IO The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. x. from the epiglottis to the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages, and coursing in various directions. Usually in a dissecting-room body these fibres are so pale as to be scarcely visible ; but they have been described as consisting of three muscles, the thyro- epiglottideus, and aryteno-epiglottideus superior and inferior. On the outer side, and rather below the ventricle, are muscular fibres, stretching from the thyroid car- tilage to the arytenoid (thyro-arytsenoideus). These usually consist of several fasciculi, running in dif- ferent directions, and can be easily made out after the removal of one half of the thyroid cartilage. The muscle can also be readily made out from the inside of the larynx, after it has been cut in two by dividing the thyroid cartilage in front, and the cricoid in front and behind, as well as the soft parts. In order to see it, the mucous membrane must be removed just below the true vocal cords, and the side of the crico-thyroid membrane cut away where it passes up to become continuous with the vocal cords, when the fibres of the muscles will be at once displayed. The superior laryngeal artery, which has been traced to the thyro-hyoid membrane from the outside, will be seen breaking up into numerous small unnamed branches after piercing that membrane, and is accompanied by some branches of the superior laryngeal nerve. The recurrent laryngeal, which was seen, during the dissection of the pharynx, to pass under the inferior constrictor, can now be traced very easily, if gentle traction is exerted upon it, under the crico-arytsenoideus posticus. Underneath this muscle it divides into branches, which enter the deep surface of all the rest of the muscles, except the crico- thyroid.

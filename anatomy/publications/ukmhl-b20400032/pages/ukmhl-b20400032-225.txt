Chap. VI.] Upper Aperture of Thorax. 211 The two pleurae, with the lungs inside them, have been already stated to pass out of the thorax above, when their surface marking was studied; the extent to which they do so can be made out if the student pushes his fingers into the apices of the pleurse. On the skeleton, a line drawn on each side, from the costo-vertebral to the costo-sternal articulation of the first rib, will mark with fair accuracy the inner edges of the two pleurse, the spaces in between them being devoted to the oesophagus, trachea, blood-vessels and nerves. After these general considerations have been mastered, the boundaries and the positions of the parts which pass through the space should be clearly made out. If it has not been done, the ligaments which compose the sterno-clavicular articulation should be dissected. This articulation is usually dissected with the arm. Whoever dissects it should remember to examine the bones and cartilages which enter into its formation, and the ligaments which bound it externally; and when this has been done, an incision should be made into its capsule to see the fibro- cartilage which it contains. When this has been accom- plished^ the sternal end of the clavicle, with the sterno- mastoid and sterno-hyoid muscles, should be separated and turned upwards. The superior aperture of the thorax is bounded behind by the first dorsal vertebrae, at each side by the first rib and costal cartilage, and in front by the sternum. The structures, in detail, which it transmits are : Ligaments : Anterior common of spuie. Muscles: Longus colli. Sterno-hyoid. Sterno-thyroid. Arteries : Innominate. Left subclavian. I Arteries: Left common carotid. Both internal mammaries. Both superior intercostals. Thyroidea ima (sometimes). Veins : Eight and left innominates. Inferior thyroid veins

The small sciatic nerve has already been traced across it, and must be held out of the way with hooks to expose its deeper parts. The student must begin at one side and carefully turn out the contents; he will readily learn the whereabouts of the external and internal popliteal nerves (branches of the great sciatic), by pulling on the sciatic. A vein (the short saphenous) will be seen coming up the back of the calf to dip down deep in the space, and join the popliteal vein, but only the upper two inches of it will be seen at this stage. Close to it several (four or five) lymphatic glands are usually seen. Their position should be carefully noted, as they are liable to become inflamed in any aJffection of the back of the leg and heel. The popliteal artery and vein can hardly be missed, and must be cleaned. On the deep surface of the popliteal artery is the branch of the obturator to the knee-joint, as was stated during the dissection of the rest of that nerve on the front of the leg. The upper ends of the gastrocnemius and plantaris will have been brought into view as far as the lower boundaries of the popliteal space ; they, too, should be cleaned as far as they are exposed, care being taken not to cut away the arteries and nerves which supply them. The back surface of the adductor magnus is to be cleaned, during which process the perforating arteries which pierce this muscle will be seen, and must be dissected. If well injected, they are readily seen to form a complete chain of anastomosis, stretching from the circumflex above to articular branches of the popliteal below. These latter branches, easily seen on the sides of the popliteal, must be carefully traced round to the front of the leg, where they all

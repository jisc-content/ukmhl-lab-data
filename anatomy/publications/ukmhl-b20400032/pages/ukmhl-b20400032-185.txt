Chap, v.] Diaphragm. of the aorta, and tlien go on to surround the oesophageal opening. The kidney has been separated from tlie back of the abdominal wall, and can therefore be turned for- ward so as to expose the last rib. When this has been done, there will be seen running along the last rib, just at the upper border of the quadratus lum- borum, an aponeurotic arch, the ligamentum arcu- atum externum, which can be traced inwards to the tip of the transverse process of the first or second lumbar vertebra. The diaphragm will be seen to take origin from this ligament. Winding round the upper erxd of the psoas, from the place where the external arcuate ligament ends to the body of the same vertebra, is the internal arcuate ligament, also giving part origin to the dia- phragm. It is under this ligament that the psoas enters the cavity of the thorax. These ligaments are only an aponeurotic thickening, which takes place ^t the point of junction of the fascia that covers the under surface of the diaphragm with the fascia (of psoas and quadratus lumborum) which belongs to the back wall of the abdomen. The remainder of the diaphragm must be cleaned by taking the fascia off, beginning from the arcuate ligaments and crura and working upwards, care being taken not to injure the phrenic arteries and veins and splanchnic nerves. When this is done, the aortic opening must be laid open^ when the aorta will be seen to be crossed by a small aponeurotic arch in front, to have the muscular crura on either side of it, and to rest on the bony vertebral column behind. If the aorta be slightly pulled over to the left side of the body, there will be seen descending to it from the thorax on its right side a vein (the vena azygos major), and, between this vein and the aorta, the thoracic duct, it is better to pull on the thoracic

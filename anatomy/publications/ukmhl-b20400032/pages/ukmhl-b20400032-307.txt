Chap. IX.] Deep Muscles of Back. 293 some distance up the back, on the surface of the deep muscles^ blending with the lumbar fascia pre- viously mentioned. To display the sheaths which the transversalis aponeurosis makes, the latissimus dorsi having been previously removed, and the obliquus externus muscle having been cut from its attachments to the ribs and ileum and turned forwards, the fibres of the internal oblique muscle of the abdomen are brought into view, running upwards to be attached to the sheath of the erector spinse. ^ They are to be carefully cleaned away from the sheath, until the fibres of the transversalis muscle are seen running, as its name implies, transversely. The fibres of the trans- versalis will be seen to end in the aponeurosis. The sheath of the erector spinse should now be opened by a vertical cut near the outer margin of the muscle. The handle of the knife should be pushed outwards to show its outer limits, and the outer edge of the muscle raised to display the front of the sheath. The aponeurosis maj^ now be divided external to the muscle, in order to display the outer edge of the quadratus lumborum from behind. The finger should be pushed into the abdomen to feel the lower edge of the kidney, if it has not been removed, and afterwards the fat may be removed to show the relation of the colon to the outer edge of the quadratus lumborum. The vessels and nerves of this region will have been dissected by the student who is dissecting the abdomen. The fascia may now be reflected from the posterior surface of the erector spinse, and the two divisions of the muscle made out. The line of separation between the outer and inner bundle of muscles is defined by the posterior divisions of the dorsal nerves, and branches of the intercostal arteries which emerge * The abdominal muscles will have been, by this time, removed by the dissector of the abdomen.

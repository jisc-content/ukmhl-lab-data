Dissection of Buttock. 83 Chap. IV.] off each fibre separately. When it is cleaned the gluteus niedius will be seen appearing from beneath its front margin covered with a dense fascia prolonged from the fascia lata of the leg. Beginning from where it touches the gluteus mt;dius, the maximus must be cut through about three-quarters of an inch from its origin, and reflected downwards and outwards towards the great trochanter. The gluteal vessels and nerves (inferior gluteal from lesser sciatic) which enter it on its deep surface must be cut away close to the muscle to facilitate the process of reflection, and its insertion into the fascia lata made out. The gluteus medius should next be cleaned and reflected partially from its origin, like the gluteus maximus. The principal structures in the gluteal region will then be exposed. The student will be able to verify the surface mark- ings of the ischial tuberosities and great trochanter which he felt through the skin. The hamstring muscles will be seen arising from the ischial tuberosity; their exact positions will be made out later on. A little above the tuberosity, and emerging from under the gluteus maximus, will be seen a muscle (pyriformis) which may be said to form the key to this region. Dissect it first, cleaning off its fascia in the direction of its fibres, and tracing it as far as the great trochanter, where it is inserted. Its origin cannot yet be seen, as it is inside the pelvis. When this muscle is well cleaned, the structures which come out from the pelvis above and below it must be made out. Various arterial branches can be seen; those above it are gluteal arteries, and those below, sciatic arteries. The gluteal arteries are traced

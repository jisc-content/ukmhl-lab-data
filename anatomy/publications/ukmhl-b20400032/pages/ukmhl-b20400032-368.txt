354 ^^^^ DissECTOR^s Manual. [Chap. xiv. incisions should be vertical, and from before back- wards. The posterior pillar of the fornix can now be followed down as far as the termination of the descending horn. When the posterior pillar has arrived in the descending horn it becomes part of the hippocampus major. If the choroid plexus be lifted up, small blood-vessels can be seen entering it, and notching the edge of the posterior pillar causes it to appear fimbriated. The same vessels indent the grey matter beneath the edge of the hippocampus major (fascia dentata). It may be observed that at this point the grey matter of the cortex of the brain becomes continuous with the grey matter of the interior, i.e., of the hippocampus major. The hippocampus major, and its notched foot-like end (pes hippocampi), can easily be seen when the choroid plexus is removed. The knife handle may now be carefully introduced into the collateral fissure, to see that it corresponds to the eminence upon the floor of the lateral ventricle (eminentia collateralis). Situated at the point where the hippocampus major and minor diverge, this collateral eminence sometimes runs down the middle horn of the lateral ventricle, behind, and parallel to, the hippocampus major. It may be remarked that unless the brain has been hardened gradually and carefully, it is liable to become distorted in shape, so that many of these projections are less prominent than they should be. The great ganglia, and taenia semi- circularis, are most conveniently dissected a little later. The next stage of the dissection is to see in their turn the Fornix and lyra. S Pineal body.

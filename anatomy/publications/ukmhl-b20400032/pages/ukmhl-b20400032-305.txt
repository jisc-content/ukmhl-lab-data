IX.] Deep Muscles of Back. be seen to give off branches to all the parts with which it is in contact, viz., the sympathetic around the vertebral artery, the occipito-atloid articulation, rectus lateralis, and rectus anticus minor. T]ie loop which it forms with tlie second nerve will be dissected with the nerves at the base of the skull. (Vide page 283.) The student is recommended to remember the course of the suboccipital nerve over the atlas, and to dissect it later on. The posterior branch of the suboccipital nerve, the one seen in the triangle, gives off branches to all the muscles of the triangle, and to the com- plexus. These branches should be carefully dissected. The profunda cervicis artery may now be traced round the outer border of the semispinalis colli, to disappear below the scalene muscles. Its origin from the superior intercostal artery will be exposed later on. The semispinalis colli should be cleaned. This muscle may be seen converging principally to the spine of the axis, and, to a lesser extent, to the spines of the other cervical vertebrae ; from these points its fibres may be traced down to the transverse processes of the upper dorsal and lower cervical vertebrae. The lower cervical nerves, viz., third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth, send branches backwai'ds to supply the muscles and skin at the back of the neck. Many of them have already been seen piercing the muscles. Sometimes the upper ones communicate beneath the complexus to form a plexus, the posterior cervical plexus of Cruveillhier.

Below, the mass of muscle is at- tached to the pelvis; but above, in the dorsal region, it divides into an outer and inner bundle. Traced from below, the muscles of the back will be seen gradually to diminish in size. The single muscle

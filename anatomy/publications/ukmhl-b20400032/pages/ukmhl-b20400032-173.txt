When this has been done they can be everted, so as to give more space, without injuring any of the soft parts. The outline of the duodenum will be perfectly clear, and so will the foramen of Winslow with a piece of stick in it, but the pancreas will be hidden by the peritoneum, and probably will not show through it. Dissect the peritoneum carefully from the duo- denum, working from the left side, where it is tied across, and has been seen to be continuous with the iejunum \ the duodenum will be observed to descend slightly towards the right after it has crossed the vertebral column, and to be uncovered by peritoneum behind. Above this part of the duodenum is situated the pancreas, and its head fits into the concavity formed by the second part of the duodenum which ascends. This part must next be divested of peri- toneum, which will be found to cover it in front only, whilst behind it lies on the kidney. Above the kidney the duodenum is again freely movable, and is therefore completely surrounded by peritoneum,* which should be stripped off so far as it can be, to expose the vessels and nerves. As a rule, this part o^ the abdomen in the dis- secting-room is not easy to make out well, partly owing to the bursting of the pancreas, and partly also because of the fluid and moisture which accumulates in an abdomen; but if the part be really a good one, the vessels and nerves about to be described can be well seen. The relations of the duodenum, pylorus, and pancreas should be thoroughly mastered first, and their exact situation, with regard to the front and back of the cavity of the abdomen^ made out, as they are of great importance, * Though the duodenTim is usually described as having a com- plete investment at this point, this is not always the case.

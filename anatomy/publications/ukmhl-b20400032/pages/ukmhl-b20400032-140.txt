The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. V. 126 incisions to those which were employed in the case of the muscles, and the abdomen will be opened. On the superficial surface of the peritoneum there will be seen the following structures, running in different directions from the umbilicus. (1) A round cord, the remains of the umbilical vein going to the liver. (2) Another cord (urachus, remains of the allan- tois) passing down to the top of the bladder. (3, 4) A cord (the remains of the hypogastric arteries) on either side of the above, passing to the inguinal regions. The perinzeiim.—The perinseum is that part of the body which lies between the anus and the sym- physis pubis. It is bounded on either side by the rami of the pubes and ischium. It includes, therefore, the external generative organs, and occupies the anterior part of the outlet of the pelvis, the back part containing the rectum and ischio-rectal fossae. Position for dissection.—The body should be placed in lithotomy position, i.e., on its back with the buttocks drawn well to the edge of the table, the legs flexed upon the abdomen and well abducted. They must be secured in this posi- tion by a piece of rope passed under the hollow of the back and secured firmly to the two knees. The student must have a pelvis before him at the same time, which must be placed so that the sacrum lies with its back surface on the table, and the sym- physis as nearly as possible horizontal; he will then be able to appreciate the exact position of the bones in the body before him.

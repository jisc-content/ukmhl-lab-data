Suboccipital Triangle. 289 Chap. IX.] out its contents. Its boundaries have been mentioned ; its contents are the vertebral artery and suboccipital nerve, which lie in a quantity of fat and connective tissue. Its floor is formed by the atlas and posterior occipito-atloid ligament. The head should now be strongly rotated, so that the mastoid process of the side which is being done may be turned as far as pos- sible from the spine of the axis. This movement makes the inferior and superior oblique muscles tense. The inferior oblique may now be cleaned by beginning at the spine of the axis and tracing it outwards. Particular care must be taken, as the lower border is followed, not to divide the great occipital nerve which winds round it. When the great occipital nerve has been found, it may be gently lifted up in order to display a twig which it sends into the inferior oblique. This branch, or a separate one, communicates with the suboccipital nerve. The great occipital nerve may be traced through the complexus, and the whole of its distribution gone over. If it is followed beneath the inferior oblique, it will be seen to emerge between the posterior arch of the atlas and lamina of the axis^ piercing the posterior atlo-axoid ligament. Where it lies upon the axis, there is a ganglion upon the nerve (ganglion of posterior root), and, external to this, the division of the trunk of the nerve into the great occi- pital, already seen, and into anterior division, should be made out. This dissection may with advantage be postponed for a little while, for later on there will be no difficulty in tracing the anterior division round the vertebral artery to the front of the neck. The occipital artery should now be found emerging from beneath the mastoid process. Just as it emerges it gives off a long and slender branch, called the princeps cervicis. The princeps cervicis divides usually into a branch which passes over, and a branch which passes beneath, the complexus. The

150 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. v. The ascending colon, like tlie descending, has no mesentery; but on reaching the caecum, the peri- toneum will be found to envelop completely that part which is nearest the small intestine, whilst the portion which rests in the right iliac fossa, and is closest to the large intestine, is covered only in front. Hanging from the outside of the large intestine, the student will notice some pedunculated masses of fat, called appendices epiploicse. The small intestines will be easily seen to be sur- rounded with peritoneum, and attached by their mesentery, round which a piece of string has been tied. The upper end of this piece of string should be surrounding the junction of the duodenum and jeju- num, but if it has slipped, there will not be the slightest difficulty in deciding where the duodenum ends; for it lies almost transversely across the spine, and, being uncovered by peritoneum behind, is firmly fixed, whilst the succeeding jejunum is freely movable. Before any dissection has been begun, the student will not easily make out the exact situation of the duodenum, crossing the spine as it does to ascend to the pyloric orifice of the stomach ; but the stomach can be made out to be surrounded entirely by peri- toneum, if the student passes his hand through the cut that has already been made in the great omentum, in order to display the lesser cavity of the peritoneum, and feels its smooth back surface. "When this has been done, he can put his hand up under the ribs of the left side, where he will find the spleen on the left of the stomach, and examine its complete covering of peritoneum. The student will find, too, that he can get his hand all round the liver, except at its upper and back part; and when he dissects the lesser cavity of peri- toneum, that one lobe of the liver (the Spigelian) looks into it. {Vide Fig. 22.)

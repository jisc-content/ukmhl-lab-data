I20 [Chap. V. The Dissector's Manual, At tlie outer edge of the rectus muscle the aponeurosis of th^ transversalis and internal oblique become blended ; these two muscles may, in fact, be said to be inserted into an aponeurosis, which begins at the outer margin of the rectus. In the upper part of the abdomen this aponeurosis splits into two to enclose the rectus ; but the lower part of this muscle, usually about the lower third, has no aponeurotic sheath on its deep surface, because the whole of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique and transversalis passes in front of it. There is usually a clearly marked lower edge to the posterior sheath of the rectus, called the fold of Douglas. Sometimes it requires a little dissection to make this edge plain. Between this point and the pelvis, the fascia transversalis is in relation with the back of the rectus. Inguinal Hernia {coverings). Direct : Does uot pass down tlie inguinal canal, and is inside the epi- gastric artery. Peritoneum. Subperitoneal fat. Fascia transversalis. Conjoined tendon. Intercolumnar fascia. Deep fascia.

In the female, similar layers can be traced, though not easily, into the labia majora, which correspond with, the scrotum of the male. There now remains still undissected the portion of the muscles in the nei<Tjhbourhood of the innominate

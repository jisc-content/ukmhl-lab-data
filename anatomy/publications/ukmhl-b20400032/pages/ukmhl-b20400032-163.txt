Chap, v.] 149 The Peritoneum. scissors or knife, so as to expose his finger, and the incision carried on along the lower border of the stomach for about three or four inches, taking care not to cut any large artery across. Through the slit thus made the student can insert his whole hand, and make out the reflection of peri- toneum which has just been described. When this is done he must leave the lesser cavity for the present, as further dissection will only destroy important relations. The next thing to he done is to trace the intestines upwards from the rectum to the stomachy and ascertain to what extent they are covered by peritoneum; in doing so the student will obtain a greater insight into and mastery over the peritoneal foldings. In the cavity of the pelvis, that portion of the rectum which rests on the sacrum will be seen, and if laid hold of between the thumb and finger will be found to be fixed in situ, as it has no mesentery. Higher up, the rectum inclines to the left to reach the sigmoid flexure, which is situated in the left iliac fossa. The upper part of the rectum and sigmoid flexure both have a mesentery, or they would, when distended, impede the blood current through the iliac vessels, which they cross. Note that the sigmoid flexure is about twenty-two inches in length. Passing up to the descending colon, it will bo found to be firmly fixed to the back of the abdomen, and to be covered only on its anterior surface by peri- toneum ; usually about one-third of the circumference is uncovered. The transverse colon is complet(;ly covered by peritoneum, and is connected with the back of the abdominal cavity by means of the transverse meso- colon, and with the lower border of the stomach by the great omentum, which also hangs down below it. {Vide Fig. 20.)

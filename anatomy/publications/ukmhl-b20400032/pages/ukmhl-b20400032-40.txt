26 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iii. idea of the axillary fascia. This fascia is close beneath the skin of the axilla, and simply covers in its contents, by being attached to the fascia of the arm and the sheaths of all the muscles which bound the axilla. For instance, it stretches across from latissimus dorsi to the pectoralis major, and above it is attached to the sheaths of the pectoralis major and minor, below to the side of the chest. It will be remembered that the costo-coracoid membrane formed the sheath of the pectoralis minor, so that, as the axillary fascia is fastened to the sheath below, they may be said to be continuous with one another. It will be found very difficult to make out the axillary fascia as a distinct membrane, but as far as possible it should be attempted. Beneath the fascia the following structures require dissection :— Boundaries of axilla. Intercosto-humeral nerves. Nerve of Bell. Lymphatic glands. Axillary vein and its bran- ches. Axillary artery and its branches Alar thoracic, and Long thoracic, f Anterior circumflex, ■! Posterior circumflex, [ Subscapular. Brachial plexus, and its sub- scapular branches, three in number. The method to be adopted in dissecting a space such as the axilla, is, first to learn and define its boundaries, afterwards to make out roughly its principal contents. When the positions of each have been noted they are to be treated more in detail. The boundaries of the axilla have already been mentioned. The principal contents are situated at the apex, and along the anterior and posterior boundaries. The dissector should therefore begin to work amongst the fat in the centre of the axilla, and proceed towards the circumference. The intercosto-humeral nerves are most likely to be divided, but should be dissected as previously mentioned. The axillary lymphatic glands

Chap, v.] 137 The Female Perinmum. Examine the spermatic cord, and see that the vas deferens (testicle duct) with its arteries is situated behind, whilst the veins are well in front; unless they are varicose they may be easily overlooked. The student must take the cord between his finger and thumb, and see how easily the hard vas deferens is distinguishable, like a piece of w^hip-cord, from the veins in front. It is often very im- portant to distinguish them on a living body. The vas should be traced down to the epididymis and divested of its sheath. The testicle itself must be sliced longitudinally, so as to show its internal structure. It will be seen to be enveloped in a fibrous cover- ing, the tunica albuginea, and to be crossed by some fibrous septa, similar in appearance to the covering. They all radiate from the point where the epididymis and blood-vessels enter. In between them are some fine white tubes (the tubuli seminiferi), which are best seen when floated out in w^ater. They can be shown by a careful dissector to be continuous with the epididymis. They can be easily pulled out with a pair of forceps and unravelled. THE FEMALE PERINEUM. List of important Structures. External generative organs, including clitoris and fonrchette. Position of urethra. Triangular ligament. Muscles and vessels (smaller than in the male). There is not so much difference, as at first sight there might appear to be, between the male and female perinseum. The corresponding parts in the two sexes are best illustrated in the case of an hermaphrodite. The

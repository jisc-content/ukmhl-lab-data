276 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. ix. its posterior border. If the glosso-pharyngeal be drawn a little way from the muscle, it will be seen to give off a small branch to it. The stylo-pharyngeus may be followed down to where it disappears beneath the middle constrictor of the pharynx, to be attached to the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. Before the structures beneath the styloid process can be properly dissected, it is necessary to draw the external carotid well out of the way, or even to divide it if necessary, and turn its ends up and down. With the bone forceps the styloid process should be nipped through, as near the base of the skull as possible. In doing this, care must be taken not to injure the facial nerve or stylo-mastoid artery. The process, and all the muscles attached to it, are to be turned forwards. The structures which require dissection are the Internal jugular vein. Internal carotid artery. Ascending pharyngeal artery. Spinal accessory nerve. Pneumo-gastric, or vagus. Glosso-pharyngeal. Hypoglossal. Sympathetic. Deep cervical plexus. The student is advised to have the base of a skull before him, and to constantly refer to the apertures by which these important structures enter and leave the skull. The following facts have at present to be ascertained about the cranial nerves : \a) Their origin from the brain, i.e.^ superficial origin ; (5) their mode of exit from the skull; (c) their course; (d) their termination; (e) their largest branches and communications. It will be found convenient to begin with the deep cervical plexus. The sterno- mastoid having been previously drawn upwards, the anterior divisions of the cervical nerves can be seen emerging just external to the internal jugular vein. The first four cervical spinal nerves constitute the

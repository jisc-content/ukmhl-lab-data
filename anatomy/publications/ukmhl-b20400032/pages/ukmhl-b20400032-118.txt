I04 The Dissector^s Manual. [Chap. iv. By fixing the tibia the foot will be readily moved backwards and forwards, flexed and extended. Other movements are apparently, though not really, performed by the ankle-joint; and to under- stand these the foot must first be studied, as it is by combining the motions of the foot and ankle that the movement, which at first sight appears to belong entirely to the ankle, is produced. Movement takes place in the foot principally be- tween the first and second rows of tarsal bones, and between the astragalus and os calcis. The rest of the joints of the tarsus are compara- tively fixed, and it is not until the phalanges are arrived at that much movement is again obtained. That movement does take place at the joints just stated can be easily proved by taking the foot in one's hands, as will be explained directly. The ligaments which limit this movement require now to be dissected. They are the long and short calcaneo-cuboid, and the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid. The long calcaneo-cuboid (long plantar) has been already displayed, and only requires to be traced on to the bases of the three middle metatarsal bones. Just on its inner side, stretching from the front of the OS calcis to the adjoining surface of the cuboid, is the short plantar, and from the calcaneum to the scaphoid the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid. The latter should be well observed, as on it rests the head of the astragalus. (Vide Fig. 12, page 108.) There are ligaments of less importance and easy to find, connecting the first and second rows of tarsal bones on the dorsum, which should be dissected. The tibialis portions will need to have its insertion very carefully dissected out, as it may be said to fulfil the function of a ligament, so closely is it in- serted into the ligaments and bones of the foot. If it be put upon the stretch, its insertion can be easily seen.

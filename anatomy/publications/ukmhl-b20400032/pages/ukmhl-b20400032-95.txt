8i Chap, IV.] Dissection of Buttock. Nelaton's line, and is of the greatest importance in detecting any change in position in the upper end of the femur, either from injury or disease. In most bodies a well-marked depression is observable, curving outwards from the coccyx. It denotes the line of the buttock. Its absence during life is indicative of disease. Structures to be Dissected in Gluteal Region. Cutaneous nerves (dorsal, lum- bar, and sacral, including lesser sciatic). Gluteus maxim us. Gluteus medius and minimus. Pyriformis. Gluteal vessels and nerves (above pyriformis). Sciatic vessels and^ nerves, and nerve to obturator in- ternus, Pudic vessels and nerves. and Gemelli. Obturator internus ternus. Quadratus femoris. Adductor magnus. Origins of hamstrings. Terminations of external and internal circumflex ar- teries helping to form the crucial anastomosis. Superior perforating artery. Greater and lesser sacro-sciatic ligaments. Bursas. Skin incisions must be made from the anterior superior spine of the ilium along the crest to the spinous process of the last lumbar vertebra. From this point downwards to the tip of the coccyx, and then downwards and outwards to the outside of the leg along the fold of the buttock. The skin should be carefully seized, and reflected outwards in one piece. When this is done a large amount of fluid will probably be seen in the sub- cutaneous tissue, owing to the body having lain for some time on its back. This renders the dissection of the superficial fascia difficult and dirty. In an old body it is sometimes advisable to clean this off in one piece, without attempting to hunt for superficial vessels and nerves; but on this point the student should consult his teacher. This fluid infiltrates the G

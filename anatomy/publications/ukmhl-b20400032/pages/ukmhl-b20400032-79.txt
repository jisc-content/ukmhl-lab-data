Chap. IV.] Dissection of the Thigh. 65 The student must be careful to notice that it crosses the femoral artery at the apex of Scarpa's triangle, and then lies on its inner side, instead of its outer. In the centre of the thigh below Scarpa's triangle will be seen the rectus muscle, passing down to be inserted into the patella, and on either side the vastus externus and internus, which are also inserted into the patella and tendon of the rectus. These must all be carefully cleaned in the direction of the muscle- fibre^^ and for this purpose the sartorius will require to be lifted up, in order that the connective tissue on its under surface may be removed. When the branch which enters it from the anterior crural nerve has been found, it had better be cut away, and like- wise the small veins and arteries that supply it. In fact, the student may take it as a general rule that all veins in the leg, with the exception of such large ones as the femoral profunda and popliteal, should be cut away during the process of cleaning. Arising on the outer side of the iliac crest, just outside the sartorius, is the tensor vaginae femoris, lyiug between the layers of the fascia lata. If the student attempts to clean this, he will find that about four or five inches from its origin it is inserted into the fascia lata; or, more properly speakingj the thickened fascia lata at the side of the leg, which is known as the ilio-tibial band, forms its tendon. If this thick fascia lata be traced downwards, it will be found to be attached in front, as has been already mentioned, to the side of the patella; farther back, to the side of the tibia (ilio-tibial band); whilst more behind still, it is continuous with the deep fascia of the back of the leg. When this is finished, the farther course of the femoral artery must be traced. The sartorius has already been so cleared that the superficial femoral artery is almost exposed. The F

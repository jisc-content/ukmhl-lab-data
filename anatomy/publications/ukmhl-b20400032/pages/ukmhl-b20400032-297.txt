Chap. IX.] Posterior Lacerated Foramen. 283 the lateral sinus, where it grooves the temporal bone, and thence into the jugular foramen. The temporal bone may now be displaced forward into the gap left by the removal of the sphenoid. It is generally necessary, in order to make the dissection easier, to cut away the greater part of the squamous portion of the occipital bone with the saw. The internal jugular vein may first be cleaned, and stuffed with a little wool. This sometimes makes the dissection easier. The meningeal branches of the occipital previously seen may be completed. The loop between the first and second nerves may be completely and easily dissected, and its branches of communication made out. Later on, the suboccipital will be seen as it crosses the atlas, and other branches discovered (Fig. 38, page 277). The hypoglossal may now be com- pletely cleaned; and afterwards the spinal accessory, glosso-pharyngeal, pneumo-gastric, and sympathetic, dissected. Before undertaking this very arduous task, the student should endeavour to study the relations and communications of these nerves upon a dissected specimen, and in doing this he should frequently refer to a text-book. He need not feel greatly disappointed if he fails to discover all the branches or ganglia which are spoken of. Here it will be indicated what a skilful dissector can usually make out. The dissection need not necessarily be conducted in this particular order, but may be modified as found convenient. It will be found best to trace the nerves from below, and when the main trunk has been made out, to follow out the branches and communications. If the spinal accessory nerve be followed upwards behind the jugular vein, a large part of it (the accessory) may usually be seen to enter the superior laryngeal branch of the vagus. Some- times a portion may be followed into both the vagus and into its pharyngeal branch. The glosso-pharyngeal

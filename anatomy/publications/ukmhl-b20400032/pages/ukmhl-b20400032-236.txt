When there is good reason fco suppose that the greater part of the inner table is sawn through, probing with a piece of wood or quill toothpick will assist in arriv- ing at a correct conclusion. The chisel and hammer should be applied very carefully to the parts which do not appear to yield. Give the chisel an occasional wrench to loosen the skull-cap. This sometimes re- quires considerable force, especially in old people, as in them the dura mater becomes so much more adhe- rent to the inside of the skull. If, as sometimes happens, it be found impossible to take off the vault of the skull without tearing the dura mater from the base, it will be safer to divide the dura mater all round v/ith a knife, and remove the upper part of it along with the bone. If the skull-cap only has been removed, the dura mater will be seen covering the brain. Before it is removed, the following structures should be examined : The interior of the skull-cap, in order to see the sutures, depressions for Pacchionian bodies^ and grooves for the middle meningeal arteries and superior longitudinal sinus. The structures themselves will be seen upon the dura mater. The dura mater sends strong septu, or partitions, between the great lobes of the brain. The dura mater consists of an outer and an inner layer. When a partition is formed the outer layer remains upon the bone, the inner layer doubles in to form the partition. At the place where the doubling in occurs an aperture is left. This is the sinus. Therefore the layers of the dura mater separate to form the sinuses. At this stage, only the superior longitudinal sinus can be seen. The remaining sinuses must be examined when the brain has been removed. To expose the superior longitudinal sinuses the student should enter the point of the scissors or knife

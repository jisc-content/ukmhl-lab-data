The dark shaded oval space in the centre repre- sents the position of the vagina in tlie female. It will be clear, therefore, that as the vagina occupies so large a space between the rami of the 23ubes, the triangular ligament in the female must be only a rudimentary structure. It only remains to bear in mind that the triangular ligament consists in reality of two layers, which, though touching one another everywhere at their cir- cumference, are separated in the centre by a space of about half an inch. Both of these layers are per- forated by the urethra and vagina. The student must master these outlines, and care- fully keep in mind their exact situation, as they may be said to form the framework of the perinseum. MALE PERINEUM.

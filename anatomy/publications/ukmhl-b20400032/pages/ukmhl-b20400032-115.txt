Chap. IV.] The Knee-joint, lOl the so-called gland of Havers, which is only a pad of fat. The nerves from the obturator, accessory obtu- rator, and sciatic, or sacral plexus, if they have before been seen, should be traced onwards as far as possible. The liiiee-joiiat,â€”The movements of this joint are more easy to understand. It is best, as a preliminary measure, to divide the muscles on the front of the thigh about two inches above the knee- joint. Underneath the crureus some muscular fibres (subcrureus) can sometimes be seen, passing down to be inserted into the capsule of the joint. The semi- membranosus should be cut short about an inch and a half from its insertion ; and the rest of the muscles, except the popliteus, which will be seen to perforate the capsule, must be removed. The capsule of the joint will be so clearly seen under the crureus that there can be no difficulty in finding it. It should be then cut open, and turned downwards with the patella; this will expose the synovial membrane, the extent of which beneath the muscle should be carefully noted. Its size and extent must be examined by pushing the handle of the knife into it where the joint has been opened. Below, a line drawn round the leg at the level of the upper edge of the tibia, would indicate its lowest limits ; at the back of the joint, a line drawn parallel to the last, about an inch above it, shows how high it extends; in front, the capsule and synovial membrane extend two fingers'-breadth above the patella. The uppermost of the posterior lines should be continued round the limb at this level, care being taken to carry the line higher up on the inner than on the outer side. Three synovial folds, the so-called ligamentum mucosum and ligamenta alaria, should be examined. The former almost divides the knee-joint into two cavities, whilst the latter stretch from it along either side of the patella.

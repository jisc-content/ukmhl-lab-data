The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. I. 4 of the body. This may, of course, be performed in a variety of ways ; but the method and order of pro- cedure which are here adopted are such as will enable the student to see as much as is possible on one body. The skin is removed by making incisions in it, and then stripping it off. The position and size of these incisions is dictated by convenience; thus too much should not be removed at once, or the underlying parts will get too dry to be dissected. Particular caVe should also be taken not to scrub off the epidermis, or most superficial layer of the skin. As the epider- mis serves to keep the skin moist and supple, if it is removed it becomes difficult to take away the in- tegument without injuring the parts beneath. Underlying tlie skin all over the body is some tissue, which usually contains fat, and is variously called subcutaneous tissue or superficial fascia. In it run the subcutaneous arteries, veins, nerves, etc. The arteries will be readily identified if injected ; if they are not injected, owing to the thickness of their coats they do not collapse, and slight pressure upon them with the forceps shows that they are empty tubes. The veins are thin-coated, and usually con- tain blood ; whilst the nerves are seen as slender white cords, and, when felt, they are evidently not hollow; they convey messages of sensation to the brain and of motion to the muscles. The difierence between all these structures will be far better seen in the larger vessels and nerves. When the subcutaneous tissue is removed, the deep fascia comes into view. It is a dense white, glistening membrane, of varying thickness in dif- ferent places. From its deep surface various pro- cesses are given ofi*, which completely ensheath the deeper parts; so that, if a thin section of a limb were made, the structures could be lifted out of their sheaths, and would leave behind a panel-work of

259 Subclavian Triangle. Chap. IX.] carefully removing the fat in the lowest part of the occipital triangle and its superficial ascending branch, looked for beneath the edge of the trapezius. Any lymphatic glands which are in the way should be carefully removed. To do this, the knife should be applied close to their capsule ; whilst this is being done the gland should be seized with the forceps, and strong traction made upon it. ^tibclavian triangle.â€”The boundaries of this triangle are, below, the clavicle; above, the omo-hyoid; and, internally, the lower end of the sterno-mastoid. Its floor is formed by the scalenus medius and posticus and the first rib. The parts found in it are : The subclavian artery. Suprascapular artery. Subclavian vein. Brachial plexus of nerves. Transversalis colli vein. Descending branches of cer- Suprascapular vein. vical plexus. External jugular vein. Nei've to subclavius. Transversalis colli artery. Lymphatic glands. Just beneath the outer edge of the sterno-mastoid muscle lies the scalenus anticus, and upon it the phrenic nerve. These structures are not actually within the triangle, but they are so important that the opportunity should be taken to see their exact rela- tions. The platysma and deep fascia having been removed^ the great veins should be followed one by one. As they are usually full of blood, care should be taken not to prick them, and if they are pricked they should be tied. The nerve to the subclavius should be sought for crossing the triangle from above downwards beneath the omo-hyoid, and entering the deep surface of the subclavius. This small nerve runs nearly parallel to the posterior edge of the sterno- mastoid, and not very far from it. When it has been found it is to be preserved, and at a later period a branch may (if the subject is a good one) be found running from it behind the sternal end of the clavicle,

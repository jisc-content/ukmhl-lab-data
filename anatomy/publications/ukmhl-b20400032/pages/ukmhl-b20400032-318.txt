304 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. x. In order to display the vay'ious constituents of the palate, and understand their relationship, an incision must be made through the mucous membrane of the palate along the middle line, the palate itself having been first made tense with hooks. "When the mucous membrane has been removed, the muscles of the palate will be displayed. In the middle line running down the uvula, will be seen the azygos uvulae. Coming down through the sinus of Morgagni, just behind the Eustachian tube, are the fibres of the levator palati. In order to display it, pull the palate to the opposite side, when the outline of the muscle will be seen through the mucous membrane. It should be traced upwards as far as the Eustachian tube and temporal bone; below, it must be followed down into the palate. The palate must next be pulled upwards, when the posterior pillar of the fauces will be rendered tense, and only requires to have its mucous membrane removed, to display the palato-pharyngeus which is contained in it. Trace the fibres downwards till they are lost in the wall of the pharynx, and upwards so as to display their insertion into the palate. The insertion consists of two bundles, separated by the levator palati. To display the tensor palati winding round the hamular process, a search must be made outside the superior constrictor. The tensor palati lies be- tween the internal pterygoid muscle and the internal pterygoid plate ; and if the connective tissue in this situation be removed by vertical incisions, the muscle will be cleaned to where its tendon winds round the hamular process. If tension be exerted upon this muscle from the outside of the pharynx, and the palate at the same time be lifted up and pulled to the opposite side, the direction of its re- flected tendon may be displayed, and the tendon can be traced to its insertion.

Carefully removing the fat and cellular tissue from the subclavian triangle, the supra- scapular artery will be found running beneath and parallel to the clavicle, and the transversalis colli artery may be completed. When this has been done, the subclavian vein and artery may be clearly exposed, and above the artery the brachial plexus. If the arm has been sufficiently dissected, the complete dissection of the brachial plexus may be begun. The points which require to be clearly made out are, first, the way in which the plexus is formed ; second, the way in which its branches are given off; third, its relations. To display the plexus clearly, the clavicle should be sawn through about its middle, and the subclavius muscle divided. The arm will by this time have been dissected enough to permit the shoulder to be pulled back, and the ends of the clavicle separa^ted. When this is done, the plexus and all its branches may be cleaned. When this has been accomplished, the student should consult his anato- mical text-book, to see which variety of plexus is present. Running parallel to the outer border of the sterno-mastoid, the scalenus anticus should be found, and traced between the subclavian artery and vein to its attachment to the scalene tubercle and dome of the pleura. Lying upon it is the phrenic nerve, and accompanying the nerve a small artery, the ascending cervical, a branch of the inferior thyroid. Anterior triangle of tlie neck.â€”This tri- angle has been already mentioned. It is bounded in front by the middle line of the neck, behind by the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, above by the body of the lower jaw and a line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process. The omo- hyoid and digastric muscles cross this triangle and subdivide it into smaller ones, called the inferior

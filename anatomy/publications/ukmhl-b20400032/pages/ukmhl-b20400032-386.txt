The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. xvi. 372 parts); he must now apply to it the process of synthesis (their buikling up). Let him stand in front of an articulated skeleton, and taking a series of pieces of paper, apply or mould them one by one to the dry bones; he will build up the body as he goes along, tirst the muscles, and then the minuter structures. Each will fall into its place with accuracy, when once the larger parts are put in as landmarks. The more nearly the student can carry out this ideal, the more nearly he approaches to the perfect anatomist. If he will set about his anatomy in this way in a large dissecting-room, where ample means are at hand to correct his mistakes, he will advance with rapid strides, and his anatomy, instead of a mass of dry facts, will stand out before him as a beautiful and well- proportioned picture. He will then lind that to answer the more ordinary of these questions is a comparatively simple task, and depends upon his acquaintance with what is called regional anatomy, that is to say, a knowledge of exactly what region an organ or structure occupies. To be called upon to display a very deeply-seated structure, which is surrounded by many important and complicated parts, is much harder, but not so hard a task as it at first sight appears. A few simple principles can be laid down con- cerning these dissection questions. In the first place, the student must picture to himself the exact situation, size, and shape of the structure which he wants to expose. The next thing to be done is to make a surface marking for the structure in question ; for the test of a good dissection answer is to lay the structure bare, with as little disturbance of the surrounding parts as possible. For this purpose definite bony prominences should, whenever it is possible, be chosen as landmarks for the incisions.

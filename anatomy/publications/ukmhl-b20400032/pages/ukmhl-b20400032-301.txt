287 Back of Neck. Chap. IX.] slips, which are given off from the outer edge of the s[)leiiius to the atlas, axis, and third and fourth cervical, vertebrse, as it passes them. The levator anguli scapulae arises from the same vertebra, in front of the splenius \ colli. It has already been partially cleaned ; it may now be completed, and if not already reflected, it should be cut through about an inch from its scapular attachment. Its upper end may be lifted up in order to see the nerve to the rhomboid muscles and the posterior scapular artery, which lie beneath it. High up, branches of the deep cervical plexus may be traced into the levator anguli scapulae ; lower down, the nerve to the rhomboid gives a twig to it. The splenius should be reflected in order to expose the complexus, and the trachelo-mastoid which lies between them. The splenius should be divided close to its spinal attachment, and turned outwards. In dividing a flat muscle like this it will usually be found convenient to push a flat director, or the handle of a knife, beneath it, and then to cut down upon this guide. The occipital attachment of the splenius should be divided in a similar manner. The occipital artery lies just beneath, so that caution is requisite in cutting through it. The fascia beneath the splenius should be re- moved, and the trachelo-mastoid cleaned. Afterwards the complexus and its inner part, which is called the biventer cervicis, made out from origin to insertion. The appearance of the double-bellied biventer is very typical, and readily enables the student to ascertain his whereabouts. A small artery is usually seen (superficial branch of princeps cervicis) winding round the upper and outer border of the complexus, to end between it and the splenius. The posterior divisions of the cervical nerves which pierce the complexus and splenius should be preserved as much as possible. The complexus should be divided where the great occipital

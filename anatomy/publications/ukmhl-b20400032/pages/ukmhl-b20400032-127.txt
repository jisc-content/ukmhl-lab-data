The Abdominal Wall, Chap, v.] One from the lower end of the sternum to the symphysis pubes (a); a second at right angles to this at its upper end (6); and a third at right angles to it at the level of the navel (c). Botli of these incisions must be carried as far out as the position of the body will allow. Dissect off the flap of skin which they include, and carry it outwards as far as is possible, taking care to remove nothing else but the skin. The lower flap must be turned downwards and outwards, commencing the dissection from the two incisions which have been already made. Unless the body is very thin and emaciated, there will be a considerable amount of fat. The Cutaneous Vessels and Serves.

As is the case with the intercostals, there is one corresponding to each vertebra. They become superficial mainly along two lines, one situated an inch or two outside the middle line of the body, and the other quite at the side. (Vide Fig. 15.) In order to find the central branches, the student should scrape carefully with a scalpel in the fat until he finds some minute arteries, which, if injected, will not be difficult to discover. The cutaneous arteries and veins at the upper part of the abdomen will be branches of the intercostals, and those below from the superficial epigastric, and perhaps from the lumbar. Accompanying them the nerves may be found, though it is by no means easy to find them in ordinary bodies, and if the ai teries are not injected, almost impossible. They vary much in number and distribution.

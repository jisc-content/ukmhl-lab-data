The Thorax, Chap. VI.] 187 The cutaneous nerves of the thorax have been ah'eady seen in connection with the dissection of the arm and back, and the muscles which are attached to the outer wall of the thorax have also been dissected and learnt, so that the inside of the thorax alone remains to be seen. The relationships of the heart and great vessels, and the lungs, to the chest wall, are of the very- greatest importance, but by the time that the chest is opened the lungs are collapsed, and the heart is so displaced that their proper positions are seldom seen in the dissecting room. This alteration of position is due to several causes. If the body is injected from the aorta, the dissection necessary to get at that vessel is quite sufficient to account for its displacement. If any other vessel be chosen for the purpose, the aorta is usually so distended with injection, that it is often displaced nearly an inch from its natural situation. Lastly, if no injection be used at all, the thorax is almost certain to be punctured, or the air finds its way into it from the neck or the abdomen, and the heart and lungs are found nearer to the spinal column than to the chest wall. As if to add to the student's difficulties, many descriptions of the position of the heart, having been taken presumably from dissecting-room bodies, place it farther to the right side of the sternum than it really is. The exacts or, more properly speaking, the average situation of the viscera, which are in a constant state of movement during life, can only be made out in one of four ways:â€”(1) By observations on the living body; (2) by frozen sections of the body made as soon as possible after death ; (3) by inserting a series of skewers through the body as soon as possible after death, and dissecting the body carefully to see what structures and organs they have pierced; (4) by

29 Chap. III.] Dissection of the Arm. No difficulty should be experienced in finding the bony points. The head of the radius is the only one which presents any difficulty, and may be felt for by grasping the arm, so that the thumb is beneath and behind the external condyle of the humerus. If the fore-arm be rotated (t.e., pronated and supinated) the head of the bone will be felt moving. This is most easily felt on the living subject. The meaning of the expressions pronation and supination should be un- derstood. When the hand is laid with its palm upon the table, it is said to be pronated ; when laid with its back upon the table, it is said to be supinated. The act of turning the hand over on to its palm is called pronation ; the act of turning it on to its back, supination. The cephalic vein begins at the bend of the elbow, and its course can usually be followed external to the biceps, where it has already been seen, between the pectoralis major and deltoid. The basilic vein lies internal to the biceps, and can usually be followed but a little way upwards from the bend of the elbow. The course of the brachial artery is indicated by a line drawn from just beneath the anterior fold of the axilla to a point midway between the two condyles of the humerus. The course of the median nerve is indicated by the same line continued almost to the centre of the palm of the hand, where the nerve terminates. To indicate the course of the musculo-spiral nerve, a line should be drawn from the centre of the axilla spirally round the back of the arm, until it arrives in front of the external condyle. The line which in- dicates the course of the ulnar nerve begins at the middle of the outer boundary of the axilla, to behind the internal condyle of the humerus \ from thence it should continue down the inner side of the fore-arm, straight to the radial side of the pisiform bone. The skin may now be reflected from the front of the arm

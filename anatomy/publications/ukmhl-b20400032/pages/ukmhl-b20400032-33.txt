19 Chap. iiL] Dissection of the Arm, 2. Along tlie whole length of the centre of the sternum. 3. At right angles to the lower extremity of the last incision as far as a line drawn down the middle of the axilla (mid-axillary line). The skin having been seized with the forceps at the upper and inner part, a start may be made, and as soon as possible the skin should be seized with the fingers and kept upon the stretch. It should then be removed in one thin layer from the subcutaneous tissue towards the axilla, the nipple being left behind. The cuts should be made with the blade of the scalpel, and^of with the point. The cutaneous nerves come from the superficial cervical plexus, intercostals, and lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostals. The first descend from the neck over the upper part of the sternum and clavicle; the anterior branches of the intercostals come out of the intercostal spaces close to the sternum, and the lateral branches of the inter- costals wind forwards round the axillary border of the pectoralis major. (Vide Eig. 15.) In looking for cutaneous nerves an endeavour should be made to find some guide to them. Sinall arteries, for instance, emerge with the anterior branches of the inter- costals, iind being injected, form ready guides to the nerves. The other nerves run by themselves. In looking for them, or, indeed, for any nerves (or small arteries), two rules should be observed :â€” 1. To begin to look for them where they are thickest and strongest. 2. To make all exploiYi- tory incisions in the direction in which they run. In removing the subcutaneous tissue over the clavicle, a thin layer of muscular fibres will come into view. They belong to a muscle called the platysma-myoides, which becomes much better developed in the neck. It is the best example of a cutaneous muscle which exists in the human body. Beneath its fibres.

69 Chap. IV.] Dissection of the Thigh, farther, it will be found to lie between the vastus externus and the femur, and finally perforate the vastus to reach the back of the leg, where its termination will be seen in the dissection of the back of the thigh. The descending branch can be traced downwards, between the vastus externus and crureus, to enter the lower part of the vastus externus, along with a branch of the anterior crural nerve. The fibres of the vastus externus may afterwards be divided, in order to trace the continuation of the artery, and its anastomosis with the superior external articular branch of the popliteal, which has yet to bÂ© dissected. The ascending branch must be traced upwards beneath the tensor fascise femoris, where it anastomoses with the gluteal. In order to fully expose the remaining branches of the profunda, the adductor longus and pectineus should be cut away from their origins and turned downwards, and the femoral artery and vein pulled to the outer side of the leg with hooks. On the under surface of the adductor longus, and lying on the adductor brevis, will be found the anterior division of the obturator nerve. It sends branches to the adductor longus and gracilis, and nearly always to the adductor brevis, pectineus, and hip-joint. If there is an accessory obturator nerve it will be found towards the outer side of the pectineus, closely under- lying its fibres, and when traced up a little way will be seen to be coming over the brim of the pelvis, and not through the obturator foramen. When the under surfaces of these muscles are cleaned, at the outer margin of the pectineus a good- sized branch of the profunda (the internal circumflex) will be seen; it passes backwards between the psoas and pectineus. Before tracing it farther, a little more dissection must be completed.

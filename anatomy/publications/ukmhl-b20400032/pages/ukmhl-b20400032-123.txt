The longitudinal arch (Fig. 12) is often for pur- poses of description divided into two, an outer and an inner arch, though it is difficult to see what is to be gained by such a method. As it is usually done, it will be followed here. The outer arch is said to be formed by the cal- caneum, cuboid, and the two outer metatarsals, and the inner arch by the rest of the bones. It is mainly kept up by those ligaments, long and short plantar and inferior calcaneo-scaphoid, which have already been carefully dissected. If the inferior cal- caneo-scaphoid (sometimes called the spring ligament, because it is said to contain elastic tissue) gives way, the head of the astragalus falls down on to the sole of the foot, and flat foot is the result. The tibialis posticus and peroneus longus can be shown, by pulling on them, to have an important in- fluence in maintaining the longitudinal arch. This, it is very obvious, will be also very materially aided by all the structures on the sole of the foot, which form a series of tie bars from the os calcis to the toes. When the arches of the foot have been thoroughly studied, the bones should be disarticulated, the great interosseous and other ligaments of the foot examined. CHAPTER Y. DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. In most dissecting-rooms, the abdomen includes that portion of the body situated between the lower part of the ribs and the upper part of the pelvic bones.

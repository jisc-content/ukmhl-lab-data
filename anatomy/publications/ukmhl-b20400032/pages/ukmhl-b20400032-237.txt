Chap.VII.] Removal of Skull-cap. 223 in the middle line, and run it forwards and backwards. When the structures contained in the sinus have been made out (cords of Willis, openings of cerebral veins, and Pacchionian bodies) the dura mater should be divided all round on a level with the incision through the bones. To effect this a knife or scissors should be pushed into the subdural (or arachnoid) cavity, and an incision made round each side, but not completed behind, where the superior longitudinal sinus and falx cerebi, or process of dura mater which separate SUB-DURAL OR ARACHNOID CAVITY ARACHNOID Fig. 31, â€” Diag-ram showing- the Subdural (arachnoid) and Subarachnoid spaces and Membranes of the Brain. the two halves of the brain, are to be left intact. In front the knife must be passed a little way, from before backwards, into the great fissure between the cerebral hemisphere and the front of the falx, separated from the crista Galli. By the arachnoid space is meant the cavity between the dura mater and the cerebral layer of the arachnoid. Soon the subarachnoid space will be mentioned. It will be found to be the space between the arachnoid and pia mater. It contains a variable amount of fluid, which lifts up the arachnoid from the surface of the brain. This is very readily seen in a fresh subject, as it contains fluid, but is not

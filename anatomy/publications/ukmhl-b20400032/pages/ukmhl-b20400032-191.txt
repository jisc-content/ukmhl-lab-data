177 Chap, v.] The Pelvic Fascia. was cut short in the dissection of the perinseum. The cut end of the urethra should be sought under the pubes in front, and a catheter or sound passed into the bladder. If no sound or catheter is at hand, the student can bend his blow-pipe slightly at the thin end, and pass it gently down the urethra till it is evident it has reached the bladder. He will be able to feel it in the bladder with his finger. Whatever instrument he has employed for the purpose must be tied tightly in, by binding the stump of the penis round with a bit of string. The bladder must then be distended through the blow-pipe, or, if a catheter or sound is used, a small hole can be made into the bladder somewhere, and when the bladder is distended the hole can be secured with a bit of string. Another good plan is to push the blow-pipe by the side of the sound, and so distend the bladder. When the viscera are all distended, their general relationship will be at once apparent, and should be borne in mind. The pelvic fascia must next be dissected, and its connections ascertained. The best method of doing this is to lay hold of the little piece of ischial spine which was left behind, tie a piece of string round itj and fix it to a block placed by the left side of the lumbar vertebra of the subject, or any other suitable place. Follow along the fascia which is attached to this spine, and which is of a good thickness, till the place is arrived at where it is attached to the pubes. With a needle a piece of string can be afiixed to it here too. This will enable it to be put on the stretch in any situation that the dissector wishes. Just behind the bulb of the urethra, the student will remember he saw the anterior layer of the tri- angular ligament when he was dissecting the perinaeum. M

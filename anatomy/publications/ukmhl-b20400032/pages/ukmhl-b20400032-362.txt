348 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. xiv. the corpus callosum, its genu and rostrum, and the following structures at the base of the brain, require to be divided : lamina cinerea, optic tract, and tuber cinereum. To manipulate the brain in this way requires rather more skill and knowledge than the student has yet acquired. Without making any sections upon the brain before him, he should proceed to learn the most important convolutions and fissures. The external surface of each hemisphere is divided into three regions, frontal, parietal, and occipital. The frontal region is divided from the parietal by the fissure of Kolando, which lies between two convolutions, which extend vertically from the great longitudinal fissure above almost to the fissure of Sylvius below. As these are the only convolutions which run in this direction down the side of the hemisphere, there should be no difficulty in finding the fissure of Ptolando. The region behind the fissure of Rolando is the parietal. It is separated from the occipital region by a short sulcus, called the external parieto-occipital. To find this fissure, it is best to look at the internal surface of the hemisphere, and find it on the inner side, where it is called internal. Beginning at the inner surface of the occipital part of the brain, there is a wedge-shaped lobe (cuneate), and in front of it a square lobe (quad- rate) ; the fissure between the wedge and the square is the internal parieto-occipital. It usually passes over the edge of the hemisphere a little way, where it is called the external parieto-occipital. The anterior inferior angle of the quadrate lobe becomes continuous with a convolution which runs just above the corpus callosum, and which may be traced all round it, both behind and in front. This is called the convolution of the corpus callosum, or gyrus fornicatus. The fissure between it and the corpus callosum is called the cal- losal fissure, or ventricle of the corpus callosum. The

Chap. XV.] Ligaments of Spine. 363 To the bodies by Stellate, or anterior costo-vertebral. Capsular. Interarticular. To transverse processes by Anterior costo-transverse. Middle costo-transverse. Posterior costo-transverse. Capsular. For the more minute details concerning these ligaments, a text-book should be consulted. In order to display them the connective tissue should be com- pletely removed, the point of the knife being dipped well in an^ongst the fibres. If the ligaments are very dry, they should be well soaked in water before dissection. Afterwards, the neighbouring bone should be well scraped with the handle of the knife, so that its periosteum is removed, and the exact attachments of the ligaments defined. One ligament, the middle costo-transverse, lies between the neck of the rib and the transverse process, and is concealed from view. To demonstrate it, the rib and transverse process should be sawn through in such a manner that the cut passes through the long axis of each. This need only be done in the case of one or two ribs. To show the ligament (interairticular) which unites the ridge upon the head of the rib to the inter- vertebral fibre-cartilage (except the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth), the capsular ligament which surrounds the head of the rib and unites it to the vertebrae should be divided all round, and the rib drawn slightly away. The ligaments which join the vertebrae together may be classified as (1) Ligaments of bodies : Anterior common. Posterior common. - " Intervertebral fibro-cartilage.

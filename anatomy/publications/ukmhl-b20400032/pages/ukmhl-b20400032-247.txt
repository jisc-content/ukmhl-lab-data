233 The Orbit, Chap. IX.] remains to be done, except to clean the carotid and make out the ophthalmic artery comirg from it. Small bands may have been observed crossing the cavernous sinus ; they divide it up into little recesses or caverns, hence its name " cavernous.'^ No- thing has been said about any of the venous trunks which enter the sinus. Owing to the removal of the brain, many of them have been destroyed, but soon the ophthalmic vein will be seen entering its front part. ]>issectioii of tlie orbit. â€”The dissection of the orbit may now be proceeded with. A pair of bone forceps and a small saw are required to ac- complish this. A Hey's saw is the one usually used. The accompany- ing diagram will serve to show what it is like. The frontal bone and roof of the orbit should be sawn through in the following manner: The first incision should extend from just internal to the ex- ternal angular process of the frontal bone into the outer part of the sphenoidal fissure; the second incision from the inner angle of the orbit to just in front, and internal to the optic foramen. The posterior ends ^^^^ 33.-Hey's Saw.

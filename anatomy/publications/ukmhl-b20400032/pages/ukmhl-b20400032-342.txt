The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. xii. 328 should be passed into all the openings into the meatuses. The meatuses are the spaces beneath the spongy bones, and are therefore three in number, called inferior, middle, and superior. The nasal duct opens into the inferior meatus, and a probe pushed upwards immediately beneath its anterior extremity will be found to enter it. When the ap- pendages of the eye were dissected, the probe was passed from above. To see the opening of the duct, the anterior extremity of the inferior spongy bone should be cut away with bone forceps. Between the middle and inferior spongy bones, one, or perhaps two, small apertures can easily be seen leading into the antrum of Highmore, and beneath the anterior extremity of the middle spongy bone is an opening through which a probe can be passed into the frontal sinuses. It is called the infundibulum, and receives the ethmoidal sinus as well as the frontal. Into the superior meatus the sphenoidal and posterior eth- moidal sinuses open, but their apertures are small, and concealed by mucous membrane. Usually the posterior ethmoidal sinuses open into the sphenoidal, and through them into the superior meatus. It is some- times easiest to pass a probe from the sinuses, both the frontal and sphenoidal, into the nose. The spheno- palatine foramen also opens into the superior meatus, but cannot be seen until the mucous membrane is cleared away. The nerve supply of the outer wall of the nose may now be examined. The same remarks apply to this as were applied to the septal nerves. Unless the part has been soaked in dilute nitric acid, the nerves will be very difficult to find and trace. They are very slender, and lie deeply in the mucous membrane. They are usually derived from Meckel's ganglion, or from its descending branches. The highest one, that which goes to the superior meatus and spongy bone, usually enters the nose by the

Chap, v.] The AT ale Perineum. 131 If the student now turns his attention to the neighbourhood of the ascending ramus of the ischium, he will find close alongside it some nerves called the superficial perineal, and arteries of the same name which accompany them. As the nerves pierce the deep layer of the superficial fascia, they will be more fully seen when the time comes for its removal. With the exception of the nerves that have just been described, the ischio - rectal fossa contains nothing else but fat, which must now be carefully and cleanly dissected out from the muscles to which it is attached. When this cavity is exposed it will be seen to be, roughly speaking, conical in shape. On its inner side is situated the levator ani, covered by the very thin anal fascia; and on its outer, the wall of the pelvic cavity, which is, to a considerable extent, covered by the obturator internus, and the strong obturator fascia. If the finger is passed up from the tuberosity along the inner wall of the pelvis, the pudic vessels (if injected) will be felt about three-fourths of an inch up. The student will also notice, when both ischio-rectal fossse are cleaned out, that there is no communication between the two, owing to the median fibrous septum which divides them. This fibrous tissue, where it joins the anus to the coccyx, is called the ano-coccygeal ligament, and, iii front of the rectum, the central tendon of the perinseum. Emerging from under the edge of the gluteus maxi- mus, about an inch outside the ischial tuberosity, will be found the long pudendal branch of the lesser sciatic; it can be traced forwards as far as the scrotum. When the fat in which this nerve lies has been removed, another layer of fascia will be exposed, which is seen to be attached on each side to the ramus of the pubes and ischium, and to turn downwards behind to

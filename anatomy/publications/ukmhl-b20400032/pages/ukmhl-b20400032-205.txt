In a normal chest, when the chest wall has been removed as above described, it will be seen to be covered by a shiny membrane. This is the parietal pleura, the layer which is reflected on to the chest wall. The lung which is left behind is covered by a thinner layer of pleura (the visceral). The space which, after the chest has been opened, lies between these two layers is called the pleural cavity. The anterior mediastimim.â€”It is important to see the exact line of attachment of the pleurse to the sternum, as it marks out the lateral limits of the anterior mediastinum. Towards its upper part, just where the sternum is joined by the second costal cartilage, the pleurse will be seen to be almost touching each other. Above this point they diverge like the two sides of one's waistcoat, and it is just behind the first bone, therefore, of the sternum that the principal contents of the anterior mediastinum are situated. From the second to the fourth costal cartilages the two pleurse are all but in contact behind the sternum, so that practically speaking there is no room left for the anterior mediastinum at this point. At the fourth costal cartilage the pleurse again become separated, owing to the rapid divergence of the left lung from the middle line. The space on the back of the sternum and costal cartilages, which is left between the pleurse at this point, is occupied by the heart and pericardium. As the hearfc is usually spoken of as lying in the middle mediastinum, it is obvious that there can be very little anterior mediastinum in this part of the chest. It will be clear, from what has just been said, that by far the greater part of the anterior medias- tinum is situated behind the first bone of the sternum.

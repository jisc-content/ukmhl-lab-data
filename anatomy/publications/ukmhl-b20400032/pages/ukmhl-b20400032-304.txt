The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. 290 former has been dissected. The latter may now bo followed downwards upon the semispinaiis colli to anastomose with an artery (profunda cervicis) which ascends from the superior intercostal. The princeps cervicis must be drawn aside, and the superior oblique cleaned; it is attached just below and behind the mastoid process. The occipital artery lies upon its upper part, but has already been cleaned. The su- perior oblique should be traced to the transverse pro- cess of the atlas. The rectus capitis posticus major may be traced upwards from the spine of the axis to its attachment to the occipital bone, and beneath its inner edge the rectus capitis posticus minor should be found and cleaned. Care must be taken, in re- moving the fat and connective tissue from the sub- occipital triangle, not to cut away the suboccipital nerve. If the fat be gradually removed a twig of the nerve is sure to be met with, and being traced into the triangle, will lead to the main trunk. In some sub- jects this plan may not succeed ; the nerves may be soft, and easily broken. When this is the case, the posterior arch .of the atlas should be sought for, and followed outwards. Lying in a groove upon its upper surface, and quite externally, is the vertebral artery, and coming out between the bone and artery is the suboccipital nerve. The nerve and artery should be cleaned, and the remaining fat of the triangle removed. The suboccipital nerve should next be followed a little way beneath the vertebral artery. It will be found to give off a large branch, not easily seen, which winds outwards round the articular process of the atlas to get to the front of the vertebral column. In its passage forwards it goes between, first, the vertebral artery and articular process; second, the rectus capitis anticus minor and the rectus lateralis. It then loops down in front of the atlas to join the anterior division of the second nerve. In its course it may

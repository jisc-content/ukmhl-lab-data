Chap. IV.] Dissection of Front of Leg. 75 manner. They are, in order from within outwards : tibialis anticus, extensor longus pollicis, extensor Jongus digitorum, and, arising lower down from the fibula, and forming part of the last muscle, the peroneus tertius. The muscles attached to the fibula, the peroneus longus above, and brevis below, are next to be dissected. They are not so easy to clean, as the fibres, particularly of the peroneus longus, run some- what obliquely, and so the fascia must be carefully removed in the direction of their fibres. When these muscles are cleaned their origins from the bones should be learnt, and compared with what the student has previously learnt on his bones. To expose the anterior tibial artery, the tibialis anticus must be separated from the extensor longus digitorum and pollicis. This is best effected by making traction on their tendons in the lower part of the leg, when the separation between the muscles will be easily seen, if it has proved to be difficult to make out previously, or small arteries which emerge between the muscles will serve as guides. The process of cleaning will probably have already displayed the anterior tibial artery below, near the annular ligament, where it becomes subcutaneous. It can be easily traced upwards from this point, and when the above-named muscles are separated, will be found to lie on the interosseous membrane which unites the tibia and fibula. Two vense comites will be found with the artery. The anterior tibial nerve also accom- panies it, and in the upper third lies outside the artery, then upon it, and below again is at its outer side. The line of the artery should be carefully com- pared with its surface marking to see that they cor- respond. Branches from the nerve artery and vein can be easily traced to muscles which pass in front of the ankle-joint. A branch of the anterior tibial artery

300 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. x. the cricoid cartilage by joining the oesophagus. The line of their junction is generally very clearly indi- cated by a change in the direction of the muscular fibres. The oesophagus fibres are much the same colour as those of the constrictors, and for some distance down the oesophagus they consist of true striped muscle. When the constrictors have been thoroughly cleaned, their exact origins must be very carefully made out, and for this purpose it is essential to have a skull at hand, so as to make out the origin of the superior constrictor from the back edges of the bony walls of the nose, as well as from the pterygo-maxillary ligament and lower jaw. By following up the fibres of the superior con- strictor, the student will find that just as there is a free edge below to this muscle, so likewise there is one above, and consequently there is a space between this muscle and the under surface of the skull, except at its insertion into the pharyngeal spine. This space is called the sinus of Morgagni, and transmits the levator palati muscle, the Eustachian tube, and branches of the ascending pharyngeal artery. When the superior constrictor is completed, the middle and inferior can be also made out and learnt. Their origins from the hyoid bone, thyroid and cricoid cartilages, etc., will easily be seen. Between the superior and middle constrictors are situated, as has been already stated, the stylo- pharyngeus muscle, and between the middle and inferior the superior laryngeal nerve, which has been dissected at a much earlier stage. To display the inside of the 'pharynx an incision must be made down the median raph6 of the con- strictors, and continued down to the lower end of the piece of oesophagus which the student has before him. Great care must be taken to cut only the muscular

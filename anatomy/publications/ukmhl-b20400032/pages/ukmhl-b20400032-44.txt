30 [Chap. III. The Dissector's Manual, by the following incisions : {a) a circular incision an inch above the condyles of the humerus ; (6) a ver- tical incision along the course of the brachial artery, from the circular incision made below the fold of the axilla to the one which has just been made above the condyles of the humerus. When the skin has been reflected in a thin layer well to the inner and outer side of the arm, the cutaneous nerves and veins should be sought for. The basilic vein should first be looked for in the lower part of the arm lying internal to the biceps. It should be followed upwards as far as the middle of the arm, where it pierces the deep fascia. It will afterwards be seen to join the accompanying veins of the brachial artery to form the axillary vein. The cephalic vein lies external to the biceps. The cutaneous nerves of the arm consist of two great groups, internal and external. The accompanying list shows the order in which they lie, from above downwards, upon the inner and outer sides of the arm and fore-arm. Internal cutaneous of mus- j Long external cutaneous. Lesser internal cutaneous. [ ternal cutaneous. Internal cutaneous. The first two internal branches a.re small, and difiS,cult to find, unless traced from their origins. The inter- costo-humeral has already been seen crossing the axilla. Its dissection may now be completed. The lesser internal cutaneous nerve lies near it, but be- comes cutaneous lower down. An internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral lies parallel to them, but nearer the back of the arm. The short external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral lies quite to the outer side of the arm close to the cephalic vein, and its long external cutaneous appears a little lower Internal.

CV,ap. v.] The Peritoneum. 143 ought not to find much difficulty in understand- ing the arrangements of the various peritoneal folds. These folds are called mesenteries, omenta, and ligaments. It is easier to remember that they are all folds, to start with, and then later on to give them their special names. Strictly speaking, the terms mesentery and meso- colon mean the membrane which is attached to the small, or large intestine; omentum, a membrane con- taining fat; ligament, a band that unites one part to another. But in the case of the peritoneum, the word mesentery is now applied to those folds of peritoneum which attach the intestines to the body wall; omen- tum, to a fold that unites one viscus to another ; whilst the term ligament is a more general one, but is employed usually for thin bands of peritoneum. Peritofietmi traced in vertical section. â€”It is best to start tracing the peritoneum from the middle of the parietal layer, on the front wall of the abdomen, about the umbilicus. Reference to the accompanying diagram may be of assistance. {Tide Fig. 20, page 144.) From this point the student must pass his finger along its smooth inner surface ; he will have no diffi- culty in following it up to the under surface of the diaphragm. If he push his hand up between the dia- phragm and the liver from the front, he will, towards the back of the diaphragm, come to a place where he can advance no farther. This is the place where the parietal layer joins the visceral. It can then be easily traced over the anterior surface of the liver to its under side, and from thence as a thin membrane to the lesser curvature of the stomach, over its front surface to form the great omentum, which hangs down from it like an apron. If the great omentum be lifted up, and turned up on to the ribs, the peritoneum will be traced round

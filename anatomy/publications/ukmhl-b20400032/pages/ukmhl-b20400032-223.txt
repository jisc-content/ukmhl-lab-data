Chap. VI.] Lower Aperture of Thorax. 209 up the cut wliicli was made in it to display the heart, the student will probably be able to dissect out the reflections by which the vessels are covered, and so ascertain which are completely invested by peri- cardium. It is best to begin with the aorfca and pulmonary artery, and then to pass on to the vense cavse and pulmonary veins. The student will do well to bear in mind, that though it is possible to make a dissection of the heart in an ordinary dissecting-room body, such dissection should at least be supplemented by the dissection of the fresh heart of a pig or sheep, or, better still, if he can obtain one, of the fresh human heart. The lower aperture of tlie ttiorax^ with the structures that pierce the diaphragm, will now be easy to get at. The diaphragm will have been somewhat destroyed by this time, if the abdomen has been dissected, but all the most important parts remain. It must be put on the stretch as far as possible, and its upper surface cleaned, taking care not to cut away any of the structures which have already been seen to pierce it. Its shape (that of a dome) will need to be carefully observed. As its edges are firmly fixed to the side of the chest, the student will readily understand that the contraction of its muscular fibres causes them to become flattened, and so enlarge the cavity of the chest, thus sucking in at each inspiration both air into the lungs and blood into the heart. An incision may now be made from the front backwards, so as to expose the contents of the mus- cular oesophageal opening. The liver has pi'esumably been removed by this time, but the stomach remains still i7i situ. (Vide Dissection of abdomen, page 163.) 9

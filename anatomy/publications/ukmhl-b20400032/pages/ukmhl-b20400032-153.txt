Chap, v.] The Female Ferinmum. 139 The sphincter vagina, very similar in appearance to that of the rectum, must then be searched for and dissected, by cutting away the labia majora. The deep layer of the superficial fascia will be found beneath the superficial fat, attached^ as in the male, to the rami of the ischium and pubes ; it can be inflated to show its connections. Underneath it, attached to the rami of the pubes, are two muscles, the erectores clitoridis, which must be traced to their destination on the clitoris. The clitoris itself must be carefully dissected, by removing all connective tissue from its surface. There will then be no difficulty in determining that it consists of two symmetrical halves, the two corpora cavernosa, but, unlike the penis, it does not contain a corpus spongiosum. As in the case of the penis, a transverse section of it must be made, to display further the structure of the corpora cavernosa, and their pectiniform septum, which is quite rudimentary. If the corpora cavernosa be traced downwards a great plexus of veins will be discovered on each side, just outside and a little behind the labia minora. It is enveloped in fibrous tissue, and is more or less pear- shaped. This is called the bulbus vestibuli. The two bulbi are homologous with bulb of the urethra in the male. Internal to these structures, just under the mucous membrane at the commencement of the vagina, two rounded bodies, about the size of a horse-bean, will be seen when the mucous membrane is removed. These are the glands of Bartholin, the ducts of which have been already seen. During the course of this dissection, some trans- verse muscular fibres (transversus perinsei) arising from the sides of the rami of the pubes, will have been brought into view. They lie in a similar position to

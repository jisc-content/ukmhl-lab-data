156 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. v. It can now be slit open and floated out in water. The student will notice that there are no villi in its mucous membrane, and no Peyer's patches, though on careful examination some small pits may be seen at intervals; these are exactly the same structures as the aggregated pits in the Peyer's patches, but not being collected together in a patch are called solitary. l>issectioia ®.f lesser oiiaeiitaam.—The posi- tion of the lesser omentum, stretching as it does from the liver and the lesser curvature of the stomach, has already been made out. At its right edge, just in front of the foramen of Winslow, are three structures of great importance, the hepatic duct on the right, the hepatic artery on the left, and the portal vein between the two. Their relative position can easily be recollected, if it is worth while doing so, by bearing in mind the relative position of the structures from which they come. To expose them, pull up the liver towards the under surface c-f the ribs, and secure it with hooks to the chest wall; the omentum will be exposed, and the three structures lying in it will be felt between the thumb and finger, if the student inserts his finger into the foramen of Winslow, and his thumb on the front surface of the mesentery. The front layer of the omentum should be seized over the vessels where it is fairly thick, and not over the lesser curvature, where it is very thin, and dis- sected carefully off, when the vessels will be exposed as above described. They cannot be traced farther at present without destroying important parts. Hissectioii of lesser cavity €>f peritOBieiim, —-In order that the student may not lose sight of the exact position and relations of the foramen of Winslow as dissection proceeds, he should obtain a piece of stick about six inches long, and pass it through the foramen into the lesser cavity.

Chap, v.] The Deep Fascia. 117 Make an incision through the deep fascia and the external oblique muscle from the umbilicus to the crest of the ilium. Leave the portion of muscle below this line, and clean the upper part, taking care to begin at the free back edge of the muscle, which abuts upon the latissimus dorsi, and which is situated about the junction of the middle with posterior third of the crest of the ilium. Keflect the deep fascia from the external oblique by cutting very carefully parallel to the course of its fibres. This is by no means an easy muscle to clean, more especially when the thin tendinous portion towards the front of the abdomen is reached. As soon as the fascia is dissected up as far as the middle line of the body in front (linea alba), cut it away altogether. In the course of cleaning the muscle from behind forwards, its three digitations on the ribs with the latissimus dorsi will come into view; higher up, those with the serratus magnus ; and next to this again, the edge of the pectoralis major. The external oblique must now be turned forwards to display the structures which lie beneath it. It has been already cut through below; make another incision along the edge of the ribs, and turn it forward from its back edge towards the linea alba. The lower portion of the muscle, more or less triangular in shape, which has been left with its fascia undissected, can be turned downwards towards the groin, like its corresponding portions of fat and skin, and left for the present for further consideration in connection with the anatomy of hernia. Passing up from the inner end of Poupart's liga- ment towards the linea alba, and situated behind the internal pillar of the ring, a few fibres may be seen in some bodies. From their triangular shape, these have received the name of the triangular ligament.

124 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. v. and transversalis, should be examined once more to see that they have been thoroughly divested of fascia and fat. This remark applies more particularly to the origin of the internal oblique and transversalis from the outer part of Poupart's ligament, which often remains undissected. JSTot less important are the insertions of the various muscles into the crest of the pubes. These insertions must be carefully dis- sected, or the anatomy of this region will not be understood. The structures on the crest of the pubes lie in the following order, from without inwards : Skin and fascia. Conjoined tendon. Exterior oblique. Pyramidalis. Triangular ligament (not Rectus. always present). Fascia transversalis. When the transversalis is turned down there will be clearly seen an artery (deep epigastric), which will almost certainly be injected, running from the middle of Poupart's ligament towards the region of the navel. On closer inspection it will be seen to lie between two thin membranes; the outer and upper is the fascia transversalis, and the lower the sub- peritoneal fat and peritoneum. These two layers are often so closely blended at every part excepting where the artery separates them, that it requires a skilled dissector to remove the one from the other in a continuous layer. Both of these structures must be turned down over the groin, like the muscles. During the course of this dissection it will have become evident that the spermatic cord traverses the abdominal muscles obliquely, just as the nerves, arteries, and veins have been found to do higher up the belly wall. When the spermatic cord enters the abdominal cavity it is soon lost to view in the pelvis, and must be traced later on. The opening in the

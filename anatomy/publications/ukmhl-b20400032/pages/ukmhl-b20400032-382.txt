Usually the ganglion is in the intervertebral foramen, but in the case of the great occipital nerve (second) it is between the pos- terior arch of the atlas and lamina of the axis, and in the case of the sacral nerves, within the sacral canal. The upper nerve roots run almost horizontally from the cord to the ganglion on the posterior root. Owing to the fact that the cord ends at the second lumbar vertebra, and that the sacral ganglia are far off, near the sacral foramena, it follows that the roots which go to these ganglia are of immense length. The extreme length of the lumbar and sacral nerve roots is accounted for by the fact that at an early period of foetal life the cord was the same length as its canal. Afterwards, the bones forming the canal grew more quickly than the cord. The nerves and ganglia being fastened to the bones, were dragged away from the cord, and the nerve roots between the cord and ganglia elongated. The filum terminale has a similar origin, but is the remains of the spinal cord itself. The anterior and posterior roots of the nerves form the brush of nerve fibres (cauda equina), which fill the lower part of the subarachnoid space. The spinal cord should be examined, in order to see two small arteries, which, if well injected, can be seen to run down at each side of the posterior median fissure. They come from the vertebral, and receive reinforce- ment all the way down the cord from small arteries which run in towards the cord along the nerve roots. These reinforcements come from all the arteries which are in proximity to the cord. A single artery may afterwards be seen running in a similar manner, and similarly reinforced, along the anterior median fissure of the cord. The thickenings of the cord in the cervical and lumbar regions may be noted, and the

Chap. XI.] The Ear. 3^5 which it ends. If he has not already done so, the student should practice the manoeuvre of passing a probe up the Eustachian tube. As this does not in any way injure the subject for future dissection, any fresh body may be used. The end of a probe should be bent in a semicircle round the edge of a penny. It should be afterwards pushed along the floor of the nasal cavity, until it touches the back of the pharynx. When it will go no farther backwards, it should be withdrawn about half an inch, and its point turned outwards and slightly upwards. If the point be now pressed outwards towards the external auditory meatus,it will enter the trumpet-shaped orifice of the Eustachian tube. When this is accomplished, the probe can no longer be turned round between the fingers. It will be evident that the direction of the Eustachian tube is in a line drawn from the external auditory meatus to the tip of the nose. It lies behind the superior maxilla. In the remains of the skull the temporal bone is almost detached. The eighth pair of nerves, carotid artery, and jugular vein (if not already divided), and chorda tympani, should be cut through. The tensor and levator palati may be divided about half an inch from the temporal bone, in order to leave their attachments to the Eustachian tube. The internal carotid and sympathetic may be again divided near the apex of the petrous bone, and the petrosal nerves cut through. The temporal bone may now be pulled out, and any of the fibrous tissue which fills the middle lacerated foramen divided. The dissection of the temporal bone should be conducted in the follow- ing stages : (1) The pinna of ear. (2) External ear from front. (3) Tympanum, and Eustachian tube from above and in front.

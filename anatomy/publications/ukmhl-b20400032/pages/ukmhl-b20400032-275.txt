Chap. IX.] Anterior Triangle of Neck. 261 carotid, superior carotid, and digastric. A little later these triangles will be seen to have the following posi- tions and boundaries : the inferior carotid triangles lie between the lower ends of the sterno-mastoid muscles, and are divided from one another by the middle line of the neck. The omo-hyoid forms their upper limit. The superior carotid triangle lies with its base against the up23er part of the sterno-mastoid, and has the omo-hyoid below, the posterior belly of the digastricus above, and the sterno-mastoid behind. The digastric triangle is bounded above by the jaw^ below by the two bellies of the digastric muscle. To enable the student to mark in these triangles, it is necessary that he should know the relation of the omo-hyoid and digastricus to the surface. A chalk line made from the middle line of the neck, a little above the pomum Adami (the prominence of the thyroid cartilage), to the middle of the clavicle, will indicate the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid. It may be mentioned that it will be found to cross the common carotid artery at the level of the cricoid cartilage. A line drawn from the mastoid process past the edge of the angle of the jaw to the body of the hyoid bone, and thence to the symphysis of the jaw, will mark the position of the digastricus. The body of the hyoid bone is not easy to feel in a fat subject, but lies just above the thyroid cartilage. Altliough many structures are enumerated as being part of the contents of these triangles, yet it will be found that they do not lie actually within their boundaries, but beneath them. The skin should now be removed from the whole of the anterior triangle. An incision has already been made from the mastoid process along the lowxr jaw as far as the symphysis. Make another along the middle line of the neck. The skin should now be dissected in a thin layer backwards towards the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid. A few

Chap.XIV.] Fourth Ventricle. 359 the fourth ventricle is exposed. This will probably spoil the valve of Yieussens forming the anterior part of its roof. A probe may be again introduced from the third ventricle through the aqueduct of Sylvius. The superior and inferior peduncles of the cerebellum form the superior and inferior boundaries of the ven- tricle (Fig. 45). The cerebellum is united to the cerebrum above by bands of white fibres, which go to the testes, and are its superior peduncles, or crura, or processus a cerebello ad testes ; below, it is united to the medulla and spinal cord by fibres which are continuous with the posterior columns of the cord, and which are called its inferior peduncles, or crura, or restiform tracts. The pons Varolii joins the two lobes of the cerebellum together, and is called its middle peduncle or commissure. These peduncles converge when they join the spinal cord and cerebrum, but diverge where they enter the cerebellum. As they enter the cere- bellum they may be seen to cross, the inferior peduncle to go to the highest (most anterior) part of the cerebellum, the superior to go to the lowest part. The lozenge-shaped space which they inclose is the fourth ventricle. Upon its floor the following parts should be made out ; Fasciculi teretes. Taenia violacea. Striae transversae. Origins of nerves (grey Locus coeruleus. matter). A median fissure runs along the floor of the fourth ventricle, and ends above in the Sylvian aqueduct, below in an aperture (ventricle of Aurantius) which leads into the central canal of the spinal cord. Emerging from the middle line are a few transverse fibres, which should be traced round the inferior peduncles to end in the auditory nerve; they are called strise acusticse, or strise medullares or trans- versse. A longitudinal elevation runs from before

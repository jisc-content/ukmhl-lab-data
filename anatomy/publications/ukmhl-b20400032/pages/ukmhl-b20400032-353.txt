339 Chap. XIII.] The Eye, removing the anterior part of the vitreous. A fine blow-pipe must now be obtained. A piece of glass tubing may be warmed in the flame of a spirit lamp until almost melting. It may then be pulled out, and the most slender part broken through. If the point of this blow-pipe be pushed through the vitreous humour as far as the margin of the lens, and a little air blown through it, a circle of small air-bubbles appears all around the margin of the lens. This is the canal of Petit, and is probably the small chink left between the edge of the lens and the inside of its capsule, the circumference of the capsule being slightly greater than that of the lens. The constric- tions are caused probably by certain fibres of the lens capsule being shorter than others. The handle of the knife may now be pushed between the retina and vitreous, over the ciliary processes, and under the margin of the lens. The object of this is to turn the anterior part of the vitreous, with the lens imbedded in it, out of the anterior part of the globe. If this portion of vitreous and lens be floated in the water, the imprints of the ciliary processes can be seen upon the surface of the vitreous around the margin of the lens. A certain amount of pigment comes ofi* the edges of the processes and forms this pigment zone, usually called the zone of Zinn. Although spoken of as being upon the surface of the vitreous humour, this pigment is really upon a capsule which contains it, called the hyaloid membrane. This membrane is invisible to the naked eye, but in front, where it is strongest, it splits to inclose the crystalline lens, and form its capsule, or, as it is sometimes called, the suspensory ligament. The handle of the knife may now be used to detach the choroid, ciliary processes, and iris from the front of the sclerotic. In doing this the ciliary nerves can be seen, the smallest and most numerous ones

Ti8 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. v. What is seen nndemeatli tlse external oblique*â€”Underneath the external oblique will be seen the internal oblique, whose fibres run at right angles to those of the muscle, just as the fibres of the in- ternal intercostals decussate with those of the external. Besides this, some nerves and. vessels entering the external oblique will have been cut through, and some of the cutaneous nerves which have been already seen can be traced a little farther towards their origin, as they traverse the abdominal muscles obliquely. There is also the triangular ligament, which has just been described. The internal oblique having been cleaned, it now only remains to cut through it by exactly similar inci- sions, and turn it forward. On its under surface, separating it from the transversalis, is a small artery, which runs from the anterior superior spine towards the navel. It is a branch of the deep circumflex iliac, which will be exposed and dissected later on, and which also forms a guide to the line of separation between the two muscles. On reflecting the internal oblique, the trans- versalis is exposed. It is readily recognised by the transverse direction of its fibres. It must be cut through and reflected, precisely in the same manner as the preceding muscles. During the process of turning each of these muscles forward, a still further portion of the cuta- neous nerves will be exposed, and they will be easily traced back some distance farther towards their start- ing place. Dissect them carefully, and see that they supply these muscles as they pass through them. Some small vessels will also be seen accompanying these branches of the intercostal and lumbar arteries, and perhaps some also form the deep epigastric, which will be more fully exposed by and by.

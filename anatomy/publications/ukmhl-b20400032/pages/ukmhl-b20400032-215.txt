Cardiac Plexuses. Chap. VI.] 20I As has been before stated, when two corresponding structures in the body are not symmetrically placed, but are situated one in front of the other, it is almost the invariable rule that the one from the right side lies behind, whilst that from the left is in front. The cardiac plexuses form no exception to this rule. The right one, or rather that plexus which receives its nerve supply from the right side of the body, lies behind the transverse portion of the aorta and upon the bifurcation of the trachea, whilst the other cardiac plexus is situated in the concavity of the arch of the aorta. In reality these two plexuses are so intimately connected that they might with almost equal pro- priety be described as one; but custom has long sanctioned their division into two, so this mode of description v/ill be adhered to. Supplying the cardiac plexuses there are in all ten nerves, three from the cervical sympathetic on each side, viz., one from each ganglion, and two from each vagus, a thoracic and cervico-cardiac branch. Of these two, only the left superior cardiac branch of the vagus and the left inferior branch of the sympathetic supply the superficial plexus, whilst all the rest go to the deep plexus. Such is the ordinary description given of the cardiac plexuses, but the student must not expect to find this arrangement in every subject; and, indeed, if he take the trouble to examine many bodies, he will find that though this in the main is a correct description, yet the number and distribution of the nerves is subject to variation. The left vagus has already been found; it only requires to be traced downwards to the arch of the aorta, where it will be seen to give ofi" a good-sized branch that winds round the arch, the recurrent laryngeal. Coming off from the recurrent laryngeal,

298 CHAPTER X. DISSECTION OF THE PHARYNX, LARYNX, AND TONGUE. Structures seen Arteries: Ascending pharyngeal. Tonsilar. Ascending palatine. Pharyngeal plexus. Constrictors of pharjmx. Stylo-pharyngeus. (Esophagus. during its Dissection. Sinus of MorgagTii. Pharyngeal aponeurosis. Posterior nares, and other openings into pharynx. Pillars of fauces. Tonsils. Back of tongue. When the pharynx, oesophagus, and larynx have been separated from the vertebral column in the manner which has just been described, they will be more readily available for dissection. The cesophagus and pharynx must be carefully stuffed with tow, either through the mouth or cesophagus, so as to distend them, and make their walls tense and easy to dissect. The skull must be placed face downwards, and secured by string or hooks to a block, and likewise the lower end of the cut oesophagus and larynx ; or they can be nailed to the block, after being firmly stretched. Before the pharynx itself is dissected, it is best to make out the pharyngeal plexus of nerves which lies on its outer surface. In close contact, too, with its walls are some arteries, but as they lie partly in and partly outside the pharynx, their dissection must be deferred till the pharynx is opened. The student must not forget their existence, or they will be cut away during the dissec- tion of the nerve plexus.

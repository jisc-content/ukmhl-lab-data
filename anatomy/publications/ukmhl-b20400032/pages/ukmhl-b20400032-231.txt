217 Chap. VII.] The Scalp. canal and brain cavity. Whilst the injection of the brain with spirit is going on, the dissection of the scalp may be begun. At most medical schools the student does not have a whole head and neck to himself; he divides it with a friend. They must therefore arrange their times for work, so that they shall not interfere with one another. A very good arrangement is for one to read some manual of dissec- tion whilst the other dissects. Presuming, of course, that the scalp has been shaved and a block placed under the head^ the following incisions should be made through the skin only : One round the head from just above the eyebrows to the external occipital pro- tuberance, and a second starting from the occipital protuberance over the top of the head to join the -other in front. The student should begin to remove the skin in front, near the root of the nose, by dis- secting up one of the corners of the flap. Keeping very close to the surface, the integument should be taken off in one clean, thin layer. Owing to the presence of many hair-bulbs, the dissection of the scalp will be found to blunt the knives very easily. Beneath the skin is a firm and tough layer of sub- cutaneous tissue, consisting of fat, blood-vessels, nerves, and hair-bulbs. The parts which are to be dissected are the Upper part of orbicularis oculi and corruga^or supercilii. Occipito-frontaHs. Muscles of ear. Nerves: [Supratrochlear, Supraorbital. Lachrymal. Temporo-malar. Auriculo-temporal. Posterior auricular. Lesser occipital. Great occipital. Arteries: Frontal. Supraorbital. Temporal. Posterior auricular. Occipital. The arteries, being injected, will not be difficult to find, and will serve as guides to the nerves which

6o The Dissector^s Manual, [Chap. iv. blood, which will run about and mess the dissection if the vein is cut. If this does happen, the vein must be tied across above and below where the cut was made, to prevent the blood from flowing over the dissection. When the vein and artery have been traced down to the apex of Scarpa's triangle, and cleaned, they can be pulled with hooks slightly to the outer side. This will expose on their under surface the origin of a large vein and artery, the profunda, or deep femoral vein and artery. Their origins should be cleaned, so as just to indicate where they lie ; but no further dissection should be attempted in this direction at present, or important structures may be wounded. The student will bear in mind that three parts of the femoral artery and vein have now been exposed : (1) The common femoral (or that part of the artery which runs from Poupart's ligament to where the profunda is given off, and is usually from two to three inches in length). (2) The superficial femoral (which comprises the remainder of the artery, between the pro- funda and the popliteal, and the course of which has yet to be made out). (3) The profunda femoris (which has yet to be traced). Outside the femoral artery lies the anterior crural nerve. It consists, just below Poupart's ligament, of numerous small fibrils, bound together by a tough connective tissue, which is extremely difficult to strip off neatly so as to bring the nerve into clear view. It should be cleaned in the same fashion as the artery and vein, and its various branches, which it begins to give off almost at once, made out. It sup- plies all the muscle which can at present be seen, except the adductor longus, and gives off the middle and internal cutaneous nerves.

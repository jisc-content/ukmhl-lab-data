240 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. external to this, a fold of conjunctiva, the plica semi- lunaris, can be seized with the forceps. Either of these structures is best seen in the student's own eyes when he looks in the looking-glass. At the inner end of the eyelids, just where the eyelashes begin, there is a small elevation, the papilla lachrymalis ; a small dark dot can be seen at the apex of each. These dots are called the puncta lachrymalia, and lead into the canaliculi, which are ducts conveying tears into the nose. A fine probe should be passed into the puncta, and onwards through the canaliculi into the lachrymal sac. The probe having been passed on until its point touches the lachrymal bone, the other extremity should be raised until it crosses the inner angle of the orbit. Steady pressure should now be made in a direction downwards, outwards, and a little backwards, and the probe will be found to enter the nasal duct. This manoeuvre is not easy to accomplish on the dead body. The eyelids should next be everted, and the handle of the knife pushed beneath them as far as possible, in order to show the folds of the conjunctiva from the eyelid to the eye. In the dissecting-room, when the eyelids are everted, a number of light-coloured streaks indicate the positions of the meibomian glands. These latter should be carefully examined, and their naked-eye characters made out. The lachrymal glands open by several ducts towards the outer part of the superior conjunc- tival fold, but these ducts can only be seen in man when specially injected with mercury. The eyelids should now be fastened together, and stuffed with tow or cotton-wool, in order to complete the dissec- tion of the orbicularis oculi muscle. This muscle, which surrounds the eye like a sphincter, consists of two parts : a palpebral, which covers the eyelids ; and an orbicular, which is situated quite outside the lids, and covers the bony edges of the orbit cavity.

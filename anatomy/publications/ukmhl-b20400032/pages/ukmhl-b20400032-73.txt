Chap. IV.] The Dissection of the Leg. 59 The first three coverings (skin, superficial fascia, and cribriform fascia) have already been dissected ; the three latter must be verified when the dissection has proceeded further. When the hernia has emerged from the saphenous opening, it turns upwards towards the abdomen ; but even when this has occurred, it can readily be dis- tinguished from an inguinal hernia, as its neck is situated below and to the outer side of the pubic spine, whilst an inguinal hernia is above, and to the inner side. The fascia lata must now be removed by similar incisions to those which were employed in the case of the skin, care being taken not to cut away the ex- ternal middle and internal cutaneous nerves. Scarpa's triaiig-Ie will be exposed, and will be seen to be bounded on the outside by the sartorius, coming from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to meet the inner edge of the adductor longus, which passes down from the pubes to form the inner boun- dary, the base of the triangle being formed by Pou- part's ligament. When the fascia lata is removed, the femoral artery will probably at once be visible; if not, it can readily be felt as a rounded cord if the body is in- jected. The student should proceed to clean it at once, by laying hold of the areolar tissue, which sur- rounds it, with his forceps, and carefully dissecting it off", taking great care not to cut away any of the small branches. Those arteries which were seen on the superficial surface of the fascia lata must be traced to the femoral. On the inner side of the artery the femoral vein must be cleaned; there will not be the slightest difficulty in finding it, if the saphenous vein is traced upwards ; but considerable care must be exercised in cleaning its walls, as they are very thin, and may contain fluid

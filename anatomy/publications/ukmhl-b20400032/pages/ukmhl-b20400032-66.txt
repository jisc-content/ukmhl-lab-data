The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. III. l^liotBlder-jOBMt.—Conceming the slioulder-joint, it is necessary to ascertain its The openings into it. The range of movement of the shoulder-joint may best be studied upon the living subject. The relations of the joint have already been acquired, but the student should see upon a skeleton how the different muscles are attached around the joint, and examine their relations upon a dissected part. When the capsule of the shoulder has been cleaned, the apertures in it should be made out. The most important opening is situated beneath the tendon of the subscapularis. The muscle should be separated from the scapula, and lifted up to expose the aperture (foramen ovale) in the capsule. At this opening a prolongation of the synovial membrane finds exit from the joint, and the tendon of the subscapularis enters it to get to its insertion. The tendon of the biceps also enters the joint, and, to see it, the capsule should be divided by a vertical incision over its course. By widely opening the capsule, the tendon of the biceps may be seen to divide at the top of the glenoid cavity, to blend at each side with the glenoid ligament. Be- sides the openings for the subscapularis and biceps, there is usually another for a prolongation of synovial membrane beneath the infraspinatus. Ell>ow-joiiat.—The same directions apply to the elbow as to the shoulder, as far as the dissection of the ligaments is concerned. The bones which enter into its formation and its ligaments are to be studied. It may be taken as an excellent specimen of a hinge- ioint. If the rotatory movement of the radius be ignored, the joint only permits of hinge movements, viz., flexion and extension. Such joints as this are Movements. Ligaments. Nerve and blood supply.

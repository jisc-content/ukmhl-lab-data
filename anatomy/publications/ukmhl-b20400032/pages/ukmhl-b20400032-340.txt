The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. xii. 326 apertures (anterior and posterior nares) winch lead into tliein should be carefully ascertained. When this has been done, a vertical section must be made with a saw on one side of the septum of the nose. If two students are dissecting, it is to be remembered that the sections are for their mutual benefit. Above, the saw-cut should pass by the side of the crista galli, and backwards through the body of the sphenoid, to emerge at the side of the posterior edge of the vomer. In front, the saw-cut passes through one of the nasal bones into the anterior nares. The soft palate should be divided behind with knife or scissors, and then the hard palate sawn through on the same side of the septum as the cut above. Upon one side of the section the septum of the nose is to be dissected, upon the other the outer wall of the nose and Meckel's ganglion. Upon the septum the following parts are to be examined: The septal cartilage. Septal branch of naso-palatine Septal branch of naso-palatine artery. nerve. Septal branch of nasal nerve. If well injected, the septal artery is seen coursing beneath the mucous membrane, from the upper and back part of the septum to the anterior palatine foramen. The septal nerve (from the naso- palatine) runs close to it in a similar direction, but is small, and by no means easy to dissect. To see it perfectly requires a part which has been specially prepared in dilute nitric acid. However, upon a favourable dissecting-room part, the nerve may be traced, like the artery, from the upper and back part of the membrane to the anterior palatine fora- men. The nerve should be carefully searched for where it is thickest and strongest, that is, above and behind. When the septal nerve and artery

332 The Dissector's Manual, [chap.xii. with the bone forceps, and the canal exposed down to the palate. The next stage of the dissection is to trace the nerve out of the posterior palatine foramen to their distribution on the palate and roof of mouth. The posterior palatine foramen lies vertically below the posterior palatine canal, and if the mucous membrane of the palate be removed in this situation, the posterior palatine nerve and artery can be found emerging. Their branches are to be traced backwards into the soft palate, and forwards along the hard palate to the anterior palatine foramen, where communica- tions are formed with the anterior palatine vessels and nerves, which have been already traced down the septum of the nose. By this time it will be found that posterior, descending, and internal branches of Meckel's ganglion have been traced. The student should carefully recapitulate them, and see that he can roughly trace the course of each. (Branches have been described entering the orbit.) The only thing which remains to be done upon the portion of skull which remains is to dissect the anterior and posterior dental branches of the superior maxillary nerve. After the superior maxillary nerve has crossed the spheno-maxillary fossa, it goes into a groove on the orbital surface of the superior maxilla. As it enters this groove it passes through the spheno-maxillary fissure, and gives ofi' two branches ; one (the temporo-malar or orbital branch) has already been seen. The other descends to enter the zygomatic surface of the superior maxilla. It runs forward in a canal, situated just above the fangs of the teeth, until it joins the anterior dental nerve. The anterior dental is given off from the superior maxillary nerve just before it emerges upon the fa/^e to become the infraorbital It runs downwards in the front wall of the antrum to form a loop with the jiosterior dental nerve. From this loop branches are given off

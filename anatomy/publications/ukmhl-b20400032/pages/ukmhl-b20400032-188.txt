T74 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. v. psoas, close to the brim of the true pelvis, is the obturator nerve. If the peritoneum which descends into the pelvis be dissected away from the brain, the nerve will be found between the bifurcation of the iliac arteries, running round the cavity of the pelvis, about three-quarters of an inch below the brim to the upper part of the obturator foramen. Quite under- neath the psoas another nerve, the accessory ob- turator, may occasionally be found. It passes down into the leg, over the brim of the pelvis, and not through the obturator foramen. The best way to discover it is to turn up the inner edge of the psoas just where it crosses under Poupart's ligament, and look for the nerve, or else trace it downwards from the obturator nerve, or the lumbar plexus close to it. In order to dissect the lumbar plexus itself, it is better to trace one of its large branches upwards. The external cutaneous or anterior crural answer best for this purpose. The muscular substance of the ])soas must be gradually removed during the progress of the dissection, and the other branches which have been seen will be readily traced. Should any diffi- culty be encountered in finding their connections with the plexus, they can be gently pulled upon with the forceps so as to make out their whereabouts. The main branches of the plexus must be traced inwards to the intervertebral foramina, and when the psoas has been thoroughly removed from the sides of the vertebral column, a further piece of the lumbar arteries and veins, and their accompanying sympathetic nerves, will be seen. Arrangements should be made at this stage v/ith the dissector of the leg, so that the continuity of the structure reaching from the abdomen to the leg may be clearly made out. Poupart's ligament should be cut away from its attachments when the hypogastric, ilio-inguinal, and

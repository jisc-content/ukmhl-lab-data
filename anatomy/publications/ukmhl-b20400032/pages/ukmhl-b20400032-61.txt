ciiap. III.] Dissection of the Arm, 47 should be found running for some distance alongside the ulnar nerve. The substance of the triceps must be divided over the course of the musculo-spiral groove, in order to see the course of the nerve and artery through it. The nerve to the anconeus is given off in the middle of the groove, and runs down to the outer condyle in the Diiddle of the substance of the triceps. The muscle should be divided vertically along the course of the nerve, which can be traced behind the external condyle into the anconeus. Near the condyle, branches may be traced from it into the capsule of the elbow- joint. A branch of the profunda artery accompanies it down in the substance of the muscle, and has been already mentioned as entering the arch joined by the anastomotica magna round the back of the humerus. To see this arch the anastomotica magna should be traced from the front of the arm, where it has been already found, by cutting transversely through the internal intermuscular septum and triceps. The re- maining branches of the nerve were dissected with the front of the arm.

Lower end of radius (already Head of the ulna. seen). Olecranon process. The way to find the head of the radius has been described. (Tide page 29.) The remaining surface markings are very simple and require no description. If a circular incision was made completely round the fore-arm at the level of the styloid processes of the ulna and radius, nothing remains but to remove the skin. The posterior branches of the internal and external cutaneous nerves may be traced round into the subcutaneous tissue from the front of the arm,

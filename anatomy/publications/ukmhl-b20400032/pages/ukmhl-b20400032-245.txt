231 Chap. IX.] Cavernous Sinus. should be recognised, but at present require no dissection. The dissection of the cavernous sinus may be begun, and afterwards the nerves contained in its walls traced onwards into the orbit. ©issection of tlie cavernous sinus.—Before beginning the dissection, the student should obtain a skull, and make out the following landmarks : The sphenoidal fissure, anterior clinoid processes, posterior clinoid processes, carotid groove, groove for sixth nerve, depression for Casserian ganglion, foramen ovale, and foramen rotundum. It may be observed that this latter foramen is immediately beneath the anterior clinoid process. When these points have been distinguished, a piece of paper may be placed in the middle fossa, so as to touch the clinoid processes internally, and the greater wing of the sphenoid, near the foramen rotundum below. The space between the paper and the clinoid processes represents the caver- nous sinus. In the dura mater, which forms its outer wall, the third, fourth, and ophthalmic divisions of the fifth nerve lie in order from above downwards. The Fig. 32.—Cavernous Sinus.

236 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. should be traced forward as far as its insertion into the tarsal cartilage, afterwards the underlying muscle got at by pulling it to one side. Only the superior border and external surface of the outer rectus muscle should at present be cleaned; and when this has been done, the muscle quite at the inner side, upon which the fourth nerve lies, may be completed. This is the superior oblique, and at the inner angle of the orbit a little fibrous loop must be found, hanging down from the frontal bone. The tendon of the muscle passes through the loop to run outward to its insertion on the globe. If the superior oblique be lifted up from its position, the internal rectus is seen, but its dissection had better be deferred until the nasal nerve has been completed. To find the nasal nerve a quantity of the orbital fat requires to be removed. The little masses of fat should be gradually picked out with the forceps, and the knife used as little as possible. Avoiding the arteries, the knife should be gently worked backwards and for- wards amongst the fat, in order to loosen it. As all the nerves run from behind, forward, this manoeuvre is not likely to divide any of them. After the ophthal- mic artery and vein have been exposed, the nasal nerve will be seen crossing the optic nerve obliquely, in company with the ophthalmic artery and vein ; it must be traced between the superior oblique and internal rectus until it enters the anterior ethmoidal foramen. In order to trace it back to its origin, the superior head of the external rectus and a quantity of fibrous tissue require division. It is to be observed that all the branches of the nasal nerve are given off from its anterior border, and that therefore the knife should be used with great care in this situation. The branches of the nasal nerve which are to be found are the long root of the ciliary ganglion, two long ciliary nerves, and the infratrochlear. These branches

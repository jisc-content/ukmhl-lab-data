3 Chap. I.] How TO Learn Anatomy. belonging to that part, he can begin his work with these bones in front of him. The information which he must seek to obtain is twofold : first, an ^accurate J^nowledge of the course and ciistribution of the various structures; and secondly, a knowledge of exactly how and where tliey touch each~"other ; in^ other words^ ^fj^ieir rela- tions. ' A knowledge of the course and distribution of a vessel or nerve is of great importance; for by this means we are enabled to understand how it is that injury or disease of one part will render the remainder useless, just as the section or rusting of one part of a telegraph wire renders it incapable of transmitting a message. In the same way, a knowledge of relations enables us to understand how it is that affections of one part of the body react on the neighbouring parts. The method by which this knowledge is obtained is by a study of surface markings and by dissection. By the term surface markings is meant the marks which must be made upon the skin to indicate the exact position and size of the underlying structures. Some- times these surface markings must be taken for granted by the student until he has actually cut into the body and ascertained for himself that they are correct. This is the case with certain of the viscera ; but the surface markings with which he will first become familiar are those of the bones, outlines of which can be felt through the skin, and identified by the aid of the bones before him. This is a good opportunity of urging upon the student the importance of studying surface markings on the living body, as by this means he can learn an immense amount of anatomy. When the surface markings are mastered, it is then time to pass on to the dissection, or cutting up,

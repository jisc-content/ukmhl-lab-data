On a very good subject the suprarenal bodies may be seen to return their blood on the right side to the vena cava, and on the left to the renal vein. The student should put his hand into the two pleural cavities above the diaphragm, and see that he can by this means get to the back of the kidneys, both of which rest partially on the diaphragm. Having cleaned the renal arteries and veins, there will be seen coming out of the hilum of the kidneys, behind them, two tubes, the two ureters, which should be traced as far as the brim of the pelvis. Two small arteries, very long and thin, from the aorta, should next be traced (the spermatic). They can easily be followed as far as the internal abdominal ring, to form one of the constituents of the cord; and from the ring upwards their corresponding veins -will be traced, that on the right entering the vena cava, wlnlst the left pours its contents into the left renal vein. The kidneys must now be pulled away with the liand from the back wall of the abdomen, so that they are attached only by their vessels and ureters, and can be afterwards replaced, so as to show their relation to the diaphragm and ribs. This will enable the re- mainder of the diaphragm, comprising the crura, arcuate ligaments, and aortic opening, to be dissected. The crura have already been seen, one on each side of the aorta; they are muscular in structure above, and tendinous lower down, where they arise from the lumbar vertebras. They must be carefully cleaned, like any other muscle; their origins can usually be traced on the right side as low as the fourth lumbar-vertebra, and on the left side to the third. If the crura be traced upwards as far as the level of the last rib, they will be seen to join over the front

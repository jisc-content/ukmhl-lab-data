Chap. III.] Dissection of the Arm. of the wrist and back of the carpus. Its close proxi- mity to the joint between the thumb and the carpus (trapezium) should be noticed. The branches which the radial gives off should be carefully made out, and afterwards the extensor tendons removed to expose the posterior carpal arch, the branches of which should be made out. It may be observed that the little finger only gets a slip from the common extensor low down, but that the tendon of the extensor minimi is double. Elisisectioii of lig-sunents.â€”The upper extre- mity may now be denuded of its muscles in order that its joints may be studied. Should the part by this time have become very dry, it should be soaked in water for a day or two before the ligaments are dis- sected. In order to display these structures to the best advantage, the point of the knife should be dipped well between the fibres. Whilst doing this they are to be put well upon the stretch. When the ligaments have been cleaned in this way, the periosteum should be removed from the bone in their vicinity, in order to make their exact limits distinct. The joints which are to be dissected with the upper extremity include the Sterno-clavicular. Elbow. Acromio-clavicular hgaraents Wrist and carpus. of outer end of clavicle. Joints of the fingers. Shoulder. An early opportunity should have been seized to ex- amine the sterno-clavicular articulation. Its capsular ligament having been cleaned, it should be opened, and its fibro-cartilage examined. The rhomboid ligament (costo-clavicular) may be examined at this time. No particular directions are required for the dissection of the coraco and acromio - clavicular ligaments.

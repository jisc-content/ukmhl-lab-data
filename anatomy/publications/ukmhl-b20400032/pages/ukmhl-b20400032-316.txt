302 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. x. and of the front of the vertebral column, together with the glands of this region, perforates the con- strictor to supply the mucous membrane of the pharynx, Eustachian tube, and tonsil. It also gives off three sets of meningeal branches, which are often difficult to trace, as they are some- times not injected. They perforate the foramen lacerum medium and posticum, and the anterior condyloid foramen. The student will do well to remember that these three arteries, ascending pharyngeal, ascending pala- tine, and tonsilar, vary much in size and distribution, as one often takes the place of the other. The pharynx should now be opened by an incision along the middle of its posterior surface (median raphe). With the skull still before him, the student must carefully study the cavity of the pharynx. The pos- terior nares, mouth, pharynx, and oesophagus, will be at once presented to his view. On the outer side of the posterior nares, and coming through the sinus of Morgagni, will be seen the funnel-shaped oriiice of the Eustachian tube, with a small hole, perhaps a six- teenth of an inch in diameter, in its centre, leading up to the middle ear. The size, situation, shape, and relations of the openings into the pharynx must be carefully studied. Guarding the opening into the mouth, two folds of mvicous membrane will be seen on each side, one in front, passing from the palate to the side of the tongue, and another behind, passing down to the pharynx. These are called respectively the anterior and posterior pillars of the fauces ; in the depression between them are situated the tonsils, the surfaces of which are marked by a series of pits. The tonsils and pillars of the fauces should be carefully studied, by the aid of a looking-glass, in the student's own body, so that he may become familiar with them under all conditions.

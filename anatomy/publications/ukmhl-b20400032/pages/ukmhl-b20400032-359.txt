Chap. XIV.] The Brain-, 345 the bifurcation. These constitute the island of Keil; or, owing to the fact, that unless the fissure is opened they are concealed from view, it is sometimes called the operculum, and the convolutions gyri operti (con- cealed gyri). The things to be looked for in the Sylvian fissure are : Island of Reil. [ Middle cerebral arteries. Outer root of olfactory bulb. Processus cuneatus. Anterior perforated spot. ) All of these structures have been seen, except the last, which is simply a hill formed by a bundle of antero-posterior fibres, joining the temporo-sphenoidal to the frontal lobe. It is mentioned here in order that attention may be drawn to the fact that not only are the two sides of the brain united by fibres, but also that the lobes and gyri are connected with each other. After the optic tracts have been followed a little way round the crura cerebri, the space (inter- peduncular), which is bounded by the chiasma in front and the crura or peduncles of the cerebrum behind, may be examined. The structures found in the interpeduncular space are the Third pair of nerves. Corpora albicantia. Tuber cinereum and infundi- bulum. Posterior perforated spot. The superficial origins of the cranial nerves have been seen before (page 227). The two whitish lumps (corpora albicantia) are formed by a twist, which occurs in a bundle of nerve fibres called the fornix. The posi- tion of the corpora albicantia should be remembered, and later on the fornix traced to them. The tuber cinereum is easily recognised, especially if the pituitary body has been preserved, for it attaches the latter to the brain. The tube is pyramid-shaped. Its base is applied to the brain; its apex to the pituitary body.

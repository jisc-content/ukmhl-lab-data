Chap. IX.] Parotid Region, 247 lip serves as a guide to the duct. In cleaning it, a detached portion of parotid gland will be seen in close connection with it. This is the glandula socia parotidis, and it may be seen to lie on the masseter. Careful search should be made for twigs of the facial nerve emerging from the gland substance, and when one has been found, the gland substance should be gradually cut through, and the branch traced in towards the lobule of the ear. About this point, the main trunk of the nerve will be discovered, and its great divisions, temporo-facial and cervico-facial, made out. Radiating through the parotid from these divisions are all the branches of the nerve. The gland requires to be gradually removed, in order to display them. The temporo-maxillary vein and carotid artery are next to be cleaned. It has just been pointed out that they lie deeper than the nerves, so that these important structures will not be en- dangered until the nerve has been passed. The branches which the facial nerve gives off before its division into temporo-facial and cervico-facial should be sought for, but as the nerve lies at a considerable depth, this is not easy. Branches of the auriculo-parotidian nerve enter the parotid below the lobule of the ear, very near the place where the external regular vein leaves it. As by this time the posterior triangle of the neck has been dissected, the trunk of the nerve may be traced into the gland from below. The veins are next to be got out. Their formation will be seen to vary somewhat, but usually the temporal and internal maxillary veins unite to form a single short trunk, which divides into two again, one which joins the internal jugular, another which is the external jugular vein. The trunk of the external carotid will be found behind the posterior margin of the jaw and at the lobule of the ear; its division into temporal and internal maxillary should

122 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. v. The layer of subcutaneous tissue, together with the external oblique, have already been turned down over the region of the groin; the internal oblique and transversalis must follow suit, and be turned over in the same direction. Before doing so, however, the student should examine once more the position of tlie externa] abdominal and the femoral ring. He will easily see that the femoral ring is below, and to the outer side of the spine of the pubes, whilst the external abdominal ring is above and to the inner side of the spine. {Vide Fig. 17.) That the internal abdominal ring at the upper end of the inguinal canal lies midway between the spine of the pubes and the anterior superior of the ilium, he must at present take for granted; he can prove and verify this later on, when it is dissected. Between the columns (pillars) of the external abdominal ring he will find some thin fasciae, or at least the remains of some. This is called, from its situation, intercolumnar, and can be shown by a careful dissector to pass over the cord and envelop the scrotum, forming one of its coats, whilst it is continuous above with the margins of the ring. When the external oblique has been turned down, making use of Poupart's ligament as a hinge, a piece more of the spermatic cord and the inguinal branch of the ilio-inguinal nerve will be exposed. When the fibres of the internal oblique are cleaned, the spermatic cord will be seen to be crossed by the lower edge of the muscle, and some of the fibres can be traced down over the cord into the scrotum; and after this they pass up again behind the tes- ticle to the symphysis pubis, forming another of its coverings. These scattered fibres have received the name of the cremaster muscle, and the fascia that unites them

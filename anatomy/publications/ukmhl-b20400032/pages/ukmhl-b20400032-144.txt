130 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap.v. If the dissection be continued round the edge of the gluteus maxinius on to its deep surface, it will soon be evident that on either side of the rectum there is a deep fossa tilled mainly with fat (ischio- rectal fossa). If the student proceed carefully to remove this fat from the side of the rectum, keeping at the same time close to the sphincter, he will come upon a muscle which is inserted round the lower part of the rectum. It comes from the sides of the pelvis. This muscle is called the levator ani. If its fibres are followed to the tip of the coccyx, about three-quarters of an inch from the anus, a very slight cellular interval will be found separating it from the coccygeus. The lower fibres of the coccygeus, where it abuts upon the levator ani, may be recognised by their direction, which courses from the ischial spine to the tip of the coccyx. Emerging through the cellular interval between the levator ani and coccygeus is a branch of the fourth sacral nerve, which descends to supply the external sphincter and the integument, and which serves as a guide to the line of separation between the two muscles. By carefully scraping on the outer surface of the coccygeus muscle, the student will find the branch of the fifth sacral nerve, which pierces it close to the junction of the sacrum and coccyx. Perhaps also he may find the coccygeal nerve, sometimes called the sixth sacral, which emerges from the great sacrosciatic ligament, which it pierces, and joins with the fourth and fifth to form the coccygeal plexus. However, the nerves forming this plexus are very small, and can only be made out by experienced dissectors. In order fully to display them, the fibres of the gluteus maximus may be divided for about an inch close to the side of the coccyx.

Chap. IV.] Dissection of Front of Leg. 73 be found to terminate in the internal malleolus. A little behind the internal malleolus, on the onter side of the leg, is the outer malleolus (or lower end of the fibula), and stretching up from it the subcutaneous surface of the fibula. A line drawn from the inner side of the head of the fibula above down to a point midway between the internal and external malleoli, will indicate the line which the anterior tibial artery takes. List of Structures to be Dissected in Front of Leg. Internal saphenous vein and nerve. External saphenous vein and nerve (a few small branches). Musculo-cutaneous nerve. Deep fascia and annular liga- ment. Tibialis anticus. Extensor longus digitorum. Extensor longus pollicis. Peroneus tertius. Peroneus longus. Peroneus brevis. Anterior tibial artery, veins, and nerve, and branches. Anterior peroneal artery. Make an incision down the leg in the line of tlie anterior tibial artery, cutting through the skin, and a transverse one at its lower end, from one side of the leg to the other. Reflect the skin, taking care, as in the case of the thigh, to leave the subcutaneous fat, etc., behind. Trace downwards from the thigh the internal saphenous vein and nerve, to the front of the internal malleolus. Towards the outer side of the leg some veins will be found, which are winding round towards the back of the leg ; they are going to join the posterior (or external) saphenous vein, which will be dissected wuth the back of the leg. In close company with these will be found, if careful search be made, some small nerves which are branches of the external saphenous nerve. Midway between the spine of the tibia and the

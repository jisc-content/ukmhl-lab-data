Clinical Manuals For Practitioners ajtd Students of Medicine. Complete Monographs on Special Subjects. npHE object of this series is to present to the Practitioner and Student of Medicine original, concise, and complete monographs on all the principal subjects of Medicine and Surgery, both general and special. It is hoped that the series will enable the Practitioner to keep abreast of the rapid advances at present made in medical know- ledge, and that it will supplement for the Student the comparatively scanty information contained in the general text-books. The Series will form a complete Ency- clopaedia of Medical and Surgical Science in separate volumes. The Manuals will be written by leading Hospital Physicians and Surgeons, whose work on each special subject may be con- sidered to be authoritative. [P.T.O.

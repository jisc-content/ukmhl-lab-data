264 The Dissector''s Manual. [Chap. ix. anatomical relations are of the greatest importance. To dissect the common carotid, the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid should be defined, in order to see the point at which it crosses the artery. The sterno-mastoid should be pulled outwards with hooks ; when this is done, the loop formed by the descendens and communicans noni are to be looked for in the upper part of the space. When the position of these nerves has been made out, a tube of fascia will be seen beneath the border of the sterno-mastoid. This, having been opened by vertical incisions, will be found to contain the common carotid artery, in- ternal jugular vein, and pneumo-gastric nerve. Their relations should be studied and examined again and again, until the student is quite familiar with them. If the sterno-hyoid muscles be pulled in towards the middle line, and the cellular tissue between the common carotid and the trachea removed, the inferior thyroid artery and vein may be seen running beliind the common carotid from the lower part of the sterno-mastoid, to enter the under - surface of the lateral lobe of the thyroid body. On the left side the oesophagus is easily seen bulging from behind the trachea and in close relation with the carotid artery. In this part of its course the oesophagus looks not unlike ordinary voluntary muscle. By carefully dissecting between the oesophagus and trachea, the recurrent laryngeal nerves may be brought into view, and traced upwards to enter the larynx beneath the lower borders of the thyroid cartilage and inferior constrictor muscle. The lower part of these nerves must be left until a later period. No attempt should as yet be made to get out the sympathetic unless it lies superficial to the inferior thyroid artery, in which case its middle ganglion lies upon the arterial trunk ; it is sometimes called the thyroid ganglion. It will be found most convenient

Chap. XIV.] The Brain. 343 The optic thalami and corpora striata will also be seen to be joined together by commissures, called the anterior, middle, and posterior. It can easily be seen that there is no separation helow between the two sides of the medulla; but in front of the pons Varolii the crura cerebri can be seen diverging, so that where they are lost beneath the temporo-sphenoidal lobes they are nearly half an inch apart. The great ganglia which lie upon the crura diverge in a similar manner, so that there is an interval between the optic thalami, and a wider interval between the corpora striata. The space between the optic thalami is called the third ventricle, and if the position of the thalami be noted, it will be found to correspond to the interval between the diverging crura cerebri. The interval between the corpora striata is more in front, and would lie between the two anterior perforated spots. At a later stage it will be seen how it is occupied. Besides the space between the ganglia, there is also an interval (lateral ventricles) between their upper surface and the cere- bral hemispheres. When all these cavities are exposed, it will be seen that there is no real line of separation between them, that they are practically one space. Of course, if the brain is intact it is not possible to look into the space between the crura cerebri (interpeduncular space), and see into the third ven- tricle. A thin layer of grey matter is spread from one crus to the other, and forms the floor of the ventricle. This layer of grey matter is not quite a flat layer. In front, the optic chiasm a lies beneath it, and behind the chiasma it is prolonged in a funnel-shaped process (tuber cinereum), to attach the pituitary body to the brain. If a delicate incision be made into the infundi- bulum, it will be found to be hollow.

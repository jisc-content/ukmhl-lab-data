Chap, v.] Dissection of Lumbar Plexus. 173 Just below the last rib, and running parallel with the ligamentum arcuatum externum, are the last dorsal artery and nerve. Next to this follow two others, the ilio-hypogastric, and below it the ilio- inguinal. If this latter nerve is traced onwards, it will be seen to pass either just inside, or just over the top of the iliac crest. These three nerves should be traced into the sub- stance of the abdominal muscles, which they can be seen to supply; their cutaneous branches were made out when the abdominal wall was dissected. (Vide page 113.) Emerging from beneath the outer border of the psoas, about where it crosses the iliac crest, is the ex- ternal cutaneous nerve; it can be traced across the iliacus muscle to the inner side of the anterior superior spine of the ilium, to disappear under Poupart's liga- ment, and supply the outer side of the thigh. By tracing the psoas dowuAvards to where it disappears under Poupart's ligament, and lifting up its outer edge, a large nerve (the anterior crural) will be found. Lying in front, and a little to inner side of the psoas, and emerging from it somewhere about the level of the third lumbar vertebra, is the genito-crural nerve, which makes its way down to the region of the internal abdominal ring, lying generally in relation with the external iliac artery. One branch (the genital) can be traced into the internal abdominal ring, whilst the crural passes down into the leg under Poupart's ligament. The student must not be surprised if he calinot find this nerve exactly as it is here described, as it is subject to some variation, and its place may be partly taken by some other branch of the lumbar pleicus, Usually the ilio-inguinal. Emerging from the inner and under surface of the

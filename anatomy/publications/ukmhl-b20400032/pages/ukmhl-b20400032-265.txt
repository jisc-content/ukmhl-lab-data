Pterygoid Region. Cl^.ap. IX.] As seon as the saw-cuts have extended almost through the bone, the elevator should be used to prize up the outer table. If it comes off alone, so much the better. All risk of injuring the inferior dental nerve and artery will have been avoided. When the portion of the ramus of the jaw has been Fig. 36.â€”Lower Jaw, showing Position of Incisions described in the Text, removed, the nerves and arteries which emerge between the two pterygoid muscles should be cleaned. The buccal nerve is very frequently cut away as the external pterygoid is being cleaned. It pierces the muscle, and is cut as the fascia is removed from its surface. Another reason why the buccal nerve is divided is, that it not infrequently pierces the tem- poral muscle as well as the pterygoid. Therefore in cleaning the temporal muscle caution should be exercised as its anterior internal edge is approached. The following structures may now be seen : External pterygoid muscle. Inferior dental nerve. Internal pterygoid muscle. Internal lateral ligament. Buccal nerve and artery. Internal maxillary artery, Gustatory nerve. and its muscular branches. In order to see the most important branches of the internal maxillary artery the lower jaw requires

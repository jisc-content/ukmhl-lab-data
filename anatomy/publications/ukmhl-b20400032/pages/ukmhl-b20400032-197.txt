183 Chap, v.] The Pelvic Viscera. branch being seen to pass onwards behind the pubes to anastomose with a similar (pubic) branch of the opposite side. Yeins, corresponding with the arteries, will be seen forming a plexus round the prostate, and in the female round the vagina and neck of uterus. Some few sympathetic branches can sometimes be traced a little way down the arteries, but they cannot be followed far without special previous preparation of the part. Those branches of the sympathetic which were seen to pass over the common iliacs during the dissection of the abdomen, can be traced to form a plexus (hypo- gastric), situated on the front of the sacrum, just below its promontory. To clean this at all well requires much time and patience. The bladder, uterus if there is one, and rectum must next be entirely divested of peritoneum, and cleaned away from all connection with the pelvic wall, except at the lower outlet. They can then be pulled out of the pelvis, and its right inner wall cleaned and examined. The sacral plexus and the pyriformis must be cleaned, and the small nerves which enter the muscle on its front surface should be looked for coming from the sacral plexus. Running down the middle of the sacrum will be seen the sacra media artery, and on either side the sympathetic chain may be traced down from the abdomen. The pelvic cavity will now be about completed, excepting only the dissection of the viscera them- selves. Before removing the viscera, they should be re- placed once more in situ, and their relations again passed in review. The air should be allowed to escape from the bladder by making an incision into it above, the

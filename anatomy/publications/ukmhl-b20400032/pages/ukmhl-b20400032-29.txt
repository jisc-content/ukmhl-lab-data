Chap. II.] Preparation for Dissection. 15 For the coloured injection, take, for an average- sized body, Eed lead J lb. White lead J lb. Boiled linseed oil 12 ozs. Mix thoroughly with half a pound of best dryers, and strain through fine canvas. Then add turpentine varnish a pint, which must be previously warmed by standing the vessel which contains it in hot water; the mixture will set hard in about an hour or two. If it is desired to make a firmer injection, more dryers must be used. The ingredients of the preservative injection can be obtained at any chemist's \ the coloured injection, at an oil and colour shop. The body is usually injected through the aorta in the following manner : An incision is made from the top to the lower end of the sternum, and the bone sawed through in the middle line. The two halves of the sternum are next forcibly separated by means of a wedge, and the pericardium freely opened with knife or scissors. With a very large and strong iron aneurism needle, a thick string is passed round that part of the aorta which is within the pericardium. A cut having been made in the aorta, a large canula is introduced and fastened by means of the string, and the injection introduced through it. If it is desired not to injure the thorax, the body may be injected through the common femoral artery. The artery merely requires to be exposed and opened sufficiently to admit an up and down (^.e. double) canula. In England only a limited time is allowed, by the anatomy Acts, for the dissection of the body. It is therefore necessary to arrange the order in which the different parts should be examined. The following

271 Sub MA XIL LARV Region. Chap. IX.] and the structures which lie above and below it learnt. To see the muscle plainly, the submaxillary gland should be hooked well up, and the anterior belly of the digastricus removed from its attachment to the lower jaw, and turned downwards. The origin of the mylo- hyoid from the body of the hyoid bone and from a median raphe should be made out, and the fibres traced to their insertion into the mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower jaw. The muscle will be seen to be quadri- lateral in shape, and if one finger be placed in the mouth beneath the tongue, and another beneath the muscle, it will be found to form the floor of the mouth. Owing to this circumstance, it was formerly called diaphragma oris. It is now time to reflect the mylo-hyoid, and dissect the parts beneath it. In order to do this, the submaxillary gland should be pulled well out of the way, the facial artery being, if neces- sary, divided as it enters it below. When the gland is being turned up, its duct may be cleaned, as it winds round the posterior edge of the mylo-hyoid. The digastricus, having previously been cut away from its attachment and turned backwards, the symphysis of the lower jaw may be sawn through, and the body drawn well upwards with hooks. The pterygoid region having been dissected this can easily be done. The tip of the tongue should have a string fastened through it, and then it should be pulled well out of the mouth. Lastly, the mylo-hyoid muscle should be cut from its attachments to the body of the hyoid bone and median raphe, and turned upwards. The following structures are to be brought into view : Sublingual gland. Genio-hyoid muscle. Genio-hyo-glossus muscle. Hyo-glossus. Stylo-glossus and lingualis. Deep portion of submaxillary gland. "Wharton's duct. Hypoglossal nerve. Lingual nerve. Submaxillary ganglion. Lingual artery and some of its branches. Lingual vein.

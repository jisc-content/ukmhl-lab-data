70 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iv. Underneath the adductor longus will be seen the adductor brevis, upon which the anterior division of the obturator nerve lies. This muscle must be care- fully cleaned, and turned downwards from its origin, when the obturator externus will be seen hiding the obturator foramen and obturator artery from the view of the dissector. The remainder of the internal circumflex, so far as it can be traced from the front of the leg, can now be easily cleaned. Like the external circumflex, it will be seen to divide into three branches; one, which may be con- sidered to be its continuation, passes back trans- versely, lying on the obturator externus, to arrive at the back of the leg. The ascending branch runs along the upper border of the adductor brevis to the pubes. The descending branch runs downwards with the posterior division of the obturator nerve upon the adductor magnus. These branches, however, are not nearly so distinctly marked as those of the external circumflex. When the adductor brevis is turned down, the posterior division of the obturator nerve, piercing the obturator externus, will be clearly brought into view, and should be traced as far as possible. The branch to the hip-joint and obturator externus will not yet be traceable; but the branches of the anterior division to the pectineus and adductor brevis have already been seen, and those to the adductor longus and gracilis can be easily followed if the nerve is carefully dissected from above downwards. The posterior branch, on the deep surface of the adductor brevis, is distributed mainly to the adductor magnus, and sends a large branch to the obturator externus. The branch to the adductor magnus enters that muscle about the junction of the upper and middle

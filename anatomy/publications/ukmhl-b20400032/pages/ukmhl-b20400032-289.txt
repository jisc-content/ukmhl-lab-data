275 Chap. IX.] Styloid Process. process. The student should feel the transverse pro- cess of the atlas, and ascertain how far it protrudes beneath the mastoid process. Only a small part of the occipital can at present be traced, but in cleaning it care must be taken not to remove its meningeal branches, which are given off as it crosses the internal jugular vein, or a large branch (superior sterno-mastoid) which it sends to the sterno- mastoid. The artery may be completely followed between the atlas and mastoid process later on. As the whole of the external carotid artery has now been exposed; its relations should be examined and learnt; the places where it begins and where it ends determined; and, more particularly, the student should note what incisions would be required to expose it in any part of its course. The parts which lie between the two carotids are now to be dissected; they are Stylo-hyoid ligament, or Glosso-pharyngeal nerve. Styloid process itself. Pharyngeal branch of vagus Stylo - glossus and stylo- occasionally, and a por- pharyngeus. tion of parotid gland. The styloid process varies in length in different subjects. The stylo-hyoid ligament extends from its apex to the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone. This ligament becomes ossified as age advances, and adds greatly to the length of the process. Both the liga- ments attached to the styloid process (stylo-hyoid and stylo-maxillary) have been mentioned before, and partially seen ; the muscles may now be studied. Beginning from the apex of the process, they are the stylo-glossus, stylo-hyoid, and stylo-pharyngeus. The stylo-glossus is seen attached more to the stylo- maxillary ligament than to the process, and the stylo-hyoid has already been dealt with. The stylo- pharyngeus must be cleaned, but care must be taken to find the glosso-pharyngeal nerve winding round

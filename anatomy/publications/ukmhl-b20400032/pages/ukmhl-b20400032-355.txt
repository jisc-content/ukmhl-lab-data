Chap. XIV.] The Brain, 341 with its base upwards. A moist cloth should be wrapped round the hemispheres to afford them support. The student will be greatly assisted in understanding the brain if, before he begins to dissect it, he acquires a rough idea as to where its most important parts are situated, and their relative positions. If possible, he should endeavour upon a museum specimen to make out, with the aid of his text-book, the position of the great ganglia and ventricles. Specimens which have been in spirit or nitric acid do not show clearly the grey and white matter. It is not possible always to tell where one begins and where the other ends, but, in any case, there should not be much difficulty in making out the larger masses of grey matter. As far as concerns the functions of animal life, movement, and sensation, the parts along the base of the brain are the most important. The medulla oblongata is simply the continuation of the spinal cord \ and the two crura cerebri are the continuations of the medulla oblongata. The pons Varolii merely joins the two halves of the cerebellum together, and, in doing so, crosses beneath the continuation upwards of the medulla into the crus. The crura cerebri appear to enter the temporo- sphenoidal lobes, but if all the convolutions of the brain were taken away, the}^ would be seen to end in the ganglia at the base of the brain. These ganglia are placed one in front of the other, upon the upper surface of the crus: that in front is called the corpus striatum; the one behind, the optic thalamus. Behind, the optic thalami, but smaller and of less importance, are the corpora quadrigemina. If the tempero-splie- noidal lobe were lifted up, and a knife pushed into the crus cerebri beneath, it would enter the optic thalamus. If the fissure of Sylvius be opened, and a knife pushed through the anterior perforated spot, it will enter the corpus striatum. {Vide page 353). If

Chap. IV.] Dissection of the Thigh, 67 Just before passing through the adductor magnus, the femoral artery gives off a branch, the anastomotica magna, which almost immediately divides into two branches; a superficial, which can be seen to accom- pany the internal saphenous nerve, and help to form the patellar anastomosis, and a deep branch. The latter runs down in the substance of the vastus' internus in front of the tendon of the adductor magnus, and in order to trace it, some fibres of the vastus must be cut away. Its ultimate distribution to anastomose with the articular branches of the popliteal artery, must be left until a later stage of the dissection. The only other branches which the superficial femoral gives ofi" are muscular. When these branches have all been dissected, the adductor magnus must be cleaned, so far as it con- veniently can be. On its inner side a thin ribbon-like muscle (the gracilis) will be seen, which must be cleaned, from its origin on the pubes to its insertion on the inner side of the tibia just below the sartorius. Great care must be taken to avoid cutting away the nerves which supply these muscles. Small injected arteries usually form guides to the places where they enter the muscles. ]>issectioii of the profunda femoris and brandies.â€”This part of the dissection can be either proceeded with at once, or the front of the leg below the knee, with the dorsum of the foot, may be finished first. List of principal additional Structures to be seen during this part of the Dissection. circumflex and three per- Removal of tensor vaginae femoris from origin. Exposure of external cir- cumflex arteries. Reflection of adductor longus, brevis, and pectineus, and exposure of inter'- forating arteries. Obturator nerve and branches. Obturator artery.

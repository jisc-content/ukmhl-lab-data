64 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iv. found in the upper third. "When they have been cleaned, they will be seen to form a plexus over the patellar, which is joined by a branch (nervus cutaneus patellae) of the internal saphenous. The saphenous nerve, which comes from the anterior crural, does not pierce the fascia lata until it reaches the lower third of the thigh, where it can generally be found without much difficulty emerging from beneath the sartorius muscle and lying behind the saphenous vein. The branch which comes forward to join the patellar plexus often perforates some of the fibres of the sartorius muscle. Close to the nerve plexus, also lying over the patella, is an arterial anastomosis ; but this will be dissected later on. After the patellar plexus is completed, it can be cut away, care being taken not to injure the main trunk of the internal saphenous nerve, and the rest of the superficial fascia can be removed, care being taken not to injure the patellar arterial anastomosis, or the branches which go to form it. The fascia lata must then be removed over the same area as the skin, and by similar incisions, but the arterial anastomosis must be preserved. The student will observe that the fascia is inserted into the sides of the patella, thus helping to keep it in its place. The muscles of the front of the thigh will then be all exposed, and the remainder of the femoral artery and vein will be easy to get at. In tracing the muscles care must be taken not to cut away any of the nerves which enter them. The sartorius must first be followed downwards quite to the lower end of the skin incision, where it will be found to be inserted into the inner border of the tibia. It is best to clean portions of it at a time, and not to attempt to strip off its sheath all at once.

93 Chap. IV.] The Sole of the Foot. plantar arch; a line drawn transversely across the sole of the foot, about half an inch in front of the bases of the metatarsal bones, will mark out the line of the plantar arch. List of Structures to be Dissected on the Sole of the Foot. Plantar cutaneous nerve and artery. Cutaneous branches of ex- ternal and internal plan- tar artery and nerve. Plantar fascia, and intermus- cular septa. Abductor pollicis. Abductor minimi digiti. Flexor brevis digitorum. Flexor accessorius. Long flexor tendons, includ- ing peroneus longus, and long plantar ligament. Lumbricales. Flexor brevis pollicis. Flexor brevis minimi digiti. Adductor pollicis. Transversus pedis. Plantar and dorsal interossei. External and internal plantar arteries, veins, and nerves, and their branches. Plantar arch (arterial). The skin of the sole of the foot can be removed in one large flap exactly the size of the sole, by cutting all round its edges. The student will be surprised at the depth he is obliged to cut in order to remove this flap, as the skin of this part of the body is very thick; it must be turned forward as far as the bases of the toes, and cut away, after which the skin must be divided up the centre of each toe and reflected. Oftentimes the sole of the foot is not in a good condition for dissection by the time the student reaches it. This is owing to the fact that the injection has not reached the vessels of the foot, and thus it is not preserved as well as it should be. On a good foot the structures which are here described will be easily seen. The first thing to be done is to dissect out the internal annular ligament, the upper border of which has already been defined during the dissection of the leg. It must be traced downwards to see that it is only a thickened portion of the deep fascia, like the anterior annular ligament. Piercing this lisrament will be seen a small branch

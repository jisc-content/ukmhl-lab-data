Chap. IX.] Prevertebral Region, 297 as far as the superior intercostal. The vein which accompanies the artery may occasionally be made out. A number of short muscular fibres will be seen ex- tending from the front and back edge of one trans- verse process to the transverse process above and below. These intertransverse muscles should be cleaned, and those in front removed, in order that the contents of the vertebral canal may be exposed. To do this completely, the anterior portions of the transverse processes, from the second to the sixth, should be removed with bone forceps. In the canal is the vertebral vein in front, and behind it the artery, with the sympathetic surrounding it. The cervical nerves, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, lie in grooves upon the upper surfaces of the transverse processes. They pass out of the spinal canal trans- versely, going behind the vertebral artery and vein. The seventh and eighth pass out in a similar manner, but of course are not in relation with the vertebral artery, which enters the canal at the sixth vertebra. The attention of the student may be again directed to the first and second cervical nerves, and he should see how they differ from the others. There is one portion of the suboccipital nerve which has not been clearly exposed; this is the part of the anterior branch which crosses over the atlas. This may be exposed by carefully dividing the rectus lateralis from the outside, keeping the nerve itself well in view. By making the nerve tense with the forceps, its course will become apparent, and it may be sepa- rated from the connective tissue in which it lies. Be- hind, it disappears beneath the vertebral artery. The anterior branch of the suboccipital differs from the anterior branches of the other cervical nerves, because it winds round inside the vertebral artery, and not round its outside.

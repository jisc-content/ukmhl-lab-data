266 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. and then the descenclens noni should be sought for and traced upwards ; it will be found to lead to the hypoglossal nerve, which should be exposed as it crosses the external carotid. The structures of the greatest importance contained in this triangle are the common carotid artery and its two branches of division. The upper part of the carotid sheath should first be opened, and the common carotid traced upwards as far as the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, where it divides. From this point the external carotid may be traced until it is lost beneath the posterior belly of the digastricus. The precaution having been taken to find the hypoglossal nerve, and its descending branch, there will be no fear of cutting it away. The branches of the external carotid should now be followed from the main trunk. Usually the superior thyroid artery can be seen lying quite super- ficially in the triangle. The main trunk of this vessel should be cleaned until it ends on the thyroid body; but in doing this, particular care must be taken not to remove any of its small branches : viz., hyoid, internal laryngeal, sterno-mastoid, and external laryngeal or crico-thyioid. The hyoid branch should be looked for running close beneath the thyro-hyoicl muscle, and at the lower border of the hyoid bone. When this artery is being dissected, care must be taken not to cut away a very slender branch of the hypoglossal nerve, which runs across it to enter the thyro-hyoid muscle. This small nerve having been found, where it lies in the greater cornu of the hyoid bone, and traced to the thyro-hyoid, the muscle itself may be cleaned. The omo hyoid and sterno-hyoid may be pulled aside to permit this to be done. The internal laryn- geal branch of the superior thyroid artery should be traced, with its accompanying nerve, beneath the thyro-hyoid muscle to enter the membrane (thyro- hyoid) which stretches from the thyroid cartilage to

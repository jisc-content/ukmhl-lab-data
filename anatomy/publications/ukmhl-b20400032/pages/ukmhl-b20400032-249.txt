The Orbit. 235 Chap. IX.] danger of removal as the small nerves, wliicli, being very much the colour of the fat and fibrous tissue, are to be sought for with great caution. It is to be observed that, with the exception of the frontal nerve with its supratrochlear and supraorbital branches, the lachrymal and fourth nerve, all the other nerves of the orbit lie upon the inner or ocular side of the muscles, and will be in no danger until the inner surfaces of the muscles are reached. The fourth nerve, owing to its small size and superficial position, is oftenest cut away ; it should therefore be sought for as soon as the fascia of the orbit has been removed. It may either be traced forwards through the sphenoidal fissure from the cavernous sinus, where it has already been seen, or sought for lying upon the superior oblique. It lies very close to the muscle, and might easily be mistaken for some of its fibres or a bit of its sheath. The frontal nerve presents no difficulties, and its supratrochlear branch is easy to trace over the pulley of the superior oblique muscle, which will be mentioned presently. The lachrymal nerve lies close to the inner edge of the external rectus muscle, and if not easily brought into view, the small artery seen running towards the outer angle of the orbit (the lachrymal artery) may be found, and will serve as a guide ; the nerve and artery lie close together. These nerves having been found and their safety ensured, the muscles which lie above and on either side of the eye-ball may be begun. The muscles beneath the globe can only be seen with advantage later on in the dissection. All the muscles arise close together, around the optic foramen, and run forward to their insertions. The in- ferior oblique is the only exception. Lying be- neath the frontal nerve, and above the globe, two muscles require cleaning; they are the levator palpebrse and the superior rectus. The first muscle

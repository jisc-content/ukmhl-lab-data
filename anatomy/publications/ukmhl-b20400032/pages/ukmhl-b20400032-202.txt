J 88 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. vi. dissecting the thorax before any other part of the body has been touched. The account given in Holden's "Landmarks"* is accurate and concise. Before attempting to dissect the thorax, the student is strongly advised- to study well the bony framework in a skeleton. If possible, he should look at a body in which the thoracic and abdominal viscera have been removed, and the diaphragm left intact, so as to get a clear idea of its shape and situation. A very cursory glance at the skeleton will enable any one to see that the ribs slope downwards, and therefore that their anterior extremities will be lower down than the part which is attached to the vertebral column. It is very important to bear this in mind, and also to learn which vertebra the front end of each rib is opposite to. The three following points in front and behind will be found to be about opposite to each other, and can be seen to be so on a well-articulated skeleton. They should be carefully committed to memory. (1) The upper end of the sternum (episternal notch) is opposite the lower border of the second dorsal vertebra. (2) The junction of the first and second bones of the sternum is ojDposite the lower border of the fourth dorsal vertebra, (3) The junction of the sternum and ensiform cartilage is opposite the lower border of the eighth dorsal vertebra. The Fig. of the thoracic viscera (vide frontispiece) is intended to show their relationship to the chest wall. In the first diagram is seen their relation- ship to the front wall of the chest, and, in the * For further information on the situation of organs, consult Braune's "Atlas of Topographical Anatomy," Sibson's "Medical Anatomy."

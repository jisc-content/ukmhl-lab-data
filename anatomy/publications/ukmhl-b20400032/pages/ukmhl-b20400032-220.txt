2o6 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. vi. To display tlie cavities of tlie heart, the vena cava, inferior and superior, should be joined by an incision, and the front wall of the auricle, including that of the auricular appendage, which curls over the origin of the aorta, must be cut away with a pair of scissors. This will expose the right auricle. To display the right ventricle, push a knife in about a quarter of an inch outside the interventricular groove till it enters the ventricle, and then carry the incision down as far as the apex. The left ventricle must be opened by a similar incision, but as its wall is much thicker, the knife must be pushed in deeper before it reaches the cavity of the ventricle. To expose the left auricle, the apex of the heart must be turned upwards, and an incision made parallel with and just above the coronary sinus. This will open the auricle; to display its cavity completely, the back surface will need to be removed, and the openings of the two pulmonary veins of the left side will be removed at the same time. It is better to study the heart's cavities in the order in which the blood passes through them. Most of the interior of right auricle is smooth, but that portion (the auricular appendix) which ex- tends in front of the aorta presents a more or less lioneycomhed appearance, due to the presence of cer- tain muscular bands, called musculi pectinati. At the upper part of the back wall between the two cavse will be seen an oval depression, the fossa ovalis, which marks the situation of a communication which existed in foetal life between the two auricles. Below this, between it and the auriculo-ventricular opening, and stretching across the cavity, are the re- mains of another fcetal structure, the Eustachian valve. Its condition in adult life varies from a few fibres, which are scarcely perceptible, to a well-marked and very thin reticulated valve of considerable extent.

Chap. IV.] 95 The Sole of the Foot. The internal plantar artery will be seen to run along the inner side of the sole, after which the student must carefully dissect it to see whether it ends in the great toe, or has a more extensive dis- tribution. The corresponding nerve, which is very much larger than the artery, must be put on the stretch with hooks, and cleaned; it will then be readily traced to give off digital branches to three and a half toes, like the median in the hand. Careful dissection will display twigs from these digital branches to the flexor brevis pollicis, and two inner lumbricales. These muscles will be seen at this stage, but must be dissected later on. The external plantar artery and nerve must be carefully traced across the foot to the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, where they both are seen to divide into a superficial and a deep branch. The superficial branch of the nerve can be easily seen to form digital branches for the remaining toes, whilst the deep branch and the plantar arch must be left till more muscles are removed. The superficial branch of the external plantar artery is not usually so named, but is spoken of as the digital branch to the little toe ; but it is, as the student who dissects it will see, more superficial than the remaining digital branches which will be displayed later on. The long flexor tendons that descend from the back of the leg will be seen to form the next layer which is presented to view. They must be well in view by this time, and will be clearly indicated if the corresponding muscles in the leg be pulled upon. They must be well cleaned; when this is done there will be seen passing backwards from the long flexor of the toes, towards the heel, a short muscle, the flexor accessorius, which underlies the external

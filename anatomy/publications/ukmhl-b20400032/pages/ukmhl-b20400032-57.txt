Chap. III.] Dissection of the Arm. 43 dorsi. They may now be more completely traced ; the cutaneous branches of the posterior divisions of the cervical and dorsal nerves pierce the trapezius and latissimus dorsi a little external to the spines of the vertebrae. If they cannot be found in the sub- cutaneous tissue, their points of emergence will be found when the muscles are cleaned. The muscles of the back which belong to the arm are the Trapezius. Latissimus dorsi. Ehomboids. Levator anguli scapulcB (lower part). Each muscle is to be cleaned from origin to inser- tion, and its nerve supply made out (if not already done). The trapezius may be begun near its occipital attach- ment, and its connective tissue removed in the direc- tion of its fibres. The great occipital nerve piercing it close to the skull should be found, and traced upwards towards the scalp. The other nerves will be found emerging in a linear series belov/ it. The attachments of the latissimus dorsi may next be made out; and a small triangular interval, bounded by the anterior edge of the la,tissimus, the posterior edge of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen, and the crest of the ilium, made out. In this small triangular space the fibres of the internal oblique muscle of the abdomen can be seen. The trapezius should be divided about two inches from its insertion to the clavicle and spine of the scapula, dissected up and turned towards the opposite side. In doing thisj its nerve supply from the spinal accessory nerve, and the transversalis colli artery, are to be found and cleaned. If the spinal accessory nerve has not been found by the dissector of the neck, it should be looked for entering the upper and internal surface of the muscle. The latissimus dorsi should afterwards be cut through below the inferior angle of the scapula. When this has been

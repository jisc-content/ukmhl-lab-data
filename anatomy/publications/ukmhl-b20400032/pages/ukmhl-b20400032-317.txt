Chap. X.] The Palate. 303 Higher up the pharynx, in the neighbourhood of the sinus of Morgagni, will be seen a depression in the mucous membrane, in which a structure similar in appearance to the tonsils is seen. The pits which have been before described in connection with the tonsils are very readily seen in this structure, which has therefore received the name of the tonsil of the pharynx. When the inside of the pharynx has been well studied, the student must for a moment turn to con- sider its formation and shape, as it is not at first by any means easy to appreciate its exact relation and attachments. But these will not be so difficult to realise if the student will bear in mind that the pharynx is a tube without any front wall. Its sides and back are formed by the constrictors, but there is a hole in front to bring it into connection with the mouth, and consequently the buccinator is made continuous with the superior constrictor by means of the pterygo- maxillary ligament. This ligament can be very readily felt in the student's own mouth as a vertical band, if he pass his finger back about half an inch behind the ascending ramus of the lower jaw. In order to dissect the inside of the pharynx, the mucous membrane and pharyngeal aponeurosis must be removed. As this is being done, the stylo- pharyngeus will be seen passing downwards, and its fibres must be traced to their destination on the back of the thyroid cartilage and pharyngeal aponeurosis.

184 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. v. student should then observe the exact situation of the, mouth of the urethra. He will see that it is, when the body is erect, the most dependent part of tlie bladder. The parts will have been so altered in relation by dissection that this may not be so now. The best way to determine this point is to examine the bladder in a post-mortem room. The viscera must now be removed by carrying the knife close round the edge of the lower aperture of the pelvis. The bladder and urethra should be removed care- fully from the vagina or rectum, whichever it is that lies behind it. It should be carefully washed both inside and out, and laid upon a table. It is better not to remove the catheter until the urethra has been slit open with a pair of scissors on its upper surface, or there is oftentimes a difficulty in finding the urethra at all. The relationship of the bladder to the prostate and vesiculse seminales and vasa deferentia should then be carefully examined. The openings of the ureters should be looked for, and the valvular aperture, to which reference was made above, examined, A piece of the mucous mem- brane of the bladder should be stripped off, to see the inside of the muscular coat. The prostate, when divested of its fibrous coat, will be seen to consist of three lobes, a middle and two lateral. In a young and healthy prostate these lobes are not very well marked, but are in most old people. Some hard concretions may be found in the prostate gland substance. The urethra will be seen to pass through the prostate. On the floor of the prostatic portion of the urethra, which is about an inch and a quarter in length, will be seen the opening of the two vasa deferentia, between which is a larger depression, the

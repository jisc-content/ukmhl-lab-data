Chap. IV.] The Arches of the Foot. 107 taken to put the knees and hips in the position above alluded to. Many of the above facts can be demonstrated on the student's own body. If he will stand quite erect in an easy position, and then touch his thighs, he will find that the extensors and flexors are quite lax, but if he bend the least bit backwards or forwards they directly become tense and contracted. The same fact can be demonstrated, tliough less easily, of the back and abdominal muscles, and if the student examine a friend's leg, he will find that the muscles on the front and back of the tibia are scarcely at all contracted when he is standing quite erect. The arches of the foot.—A well-formed foot is clearly seen to possess a longitudinal and a transverse arch. These are represented in Figs. 11 and 12. The transverse arch may be said to occur either across the distal row of tarsal bones, or across the bases DORSAL LIG.

These bones, as will be seen in the Figure, can be readily examined by dividing the foot across between the first and second row of tarsal bones on the student's part. The ligaments will then be seen on the upper and lower surfaces of the bones, and the

Chap, v.] Dissection OF Liver. 163 If the body is a very good one, some small sym- pathetic nerves may be found by the side of the arteries and veins coursing up towards the coeliac axis. When all the above parts have been thoroughly made out, the stomach must be turned down once more, so as to trace the portal vein up to the liver, and likewise to demonstrate the fact that it is the junction of the cystic and hepatic ducts which forms the common bile-duct. The student should not be in a hurry to remove these parts if the abdomen is a good one, for their relations are difficult both to dissect and understand, and it is better to arrange with the dissector of the thorax {inde Dissection of thorax, page 186), to trace the continuity of the structures which pass from the thorax into the abdomen, which cannot be done until the thorax is almost completed, so that the diaphragm and lower ribs may be cut away, and thus give a better view of the parts which the student has before him. Hissectioii of liver.â€”Before the diaphragm can be cut away the liver must be dissected, so the student must for a while leave t}ie stomach and duo- denum, and dissect the liver. Those portions of it which are in relation with the greater and lesser peritoneal, sacs have already been made out; the portion which is not covered by peritoneum is in contact with the diaphragm, and cannot be seen till the liver is removed from the body The hepatic duct, portal vein, and hepatic artery, which lie in the lesser omentum, have all been traced up to the portal fissure. The relationship of the foramen of Winslow to the liver has been seen; and if the student feel with his finger behind the second part of the duodenum he will detect the right kidney, and can trace its upper border, and feel (if he cannot see") that it

Chap. IX.] Deep Cervical Fascia. 257 the sternum. Since the bone has a certain thickness, there is an interval between these two layers at the top of the sternum^ and at this point a lymphatic gland is frequently found. The great vessels of the neck, and all the deeper muscles, are surrounded by sheaths of fascia (Fig. 37). It may be laid down as a principle, that fascia are always continuous with one another. It therefore follows^ that the sheaths of the" great vessels and muscles of the neck are continuous with the deeper surface of the cervical fascia. Another way of ex- pressing the same fact would be, to say that the sheaths are prolongations from it. Later on it will be seen that slips of fascia bind down the digastric and omo-hyoid muscles to the hyoid bone, and to the cartilage of the first rib and clavicle, respectively. It will also be seen that another slip separates the parotid from the submaxillary gland, and is attached to the jaw and styloid process, forming the stylo- maxillary ligament. To see all the processes of fascia, a frozen section through the neck would be requisite. But if a general idea of their arrangement be obtained, as the dissection is progressed with, nearly all the prolongations can be made out. A very important one will be seen to pass down behind the sternum to the pericardium. At this stage of the dissection the sheath of the sterno-mastoid should be opened by a cut made a little in front of the posterior border of the muscle. The handle of the knife may be pushed in either direction until the limits of the sheath have been defined. The deep fascia should now be removed from the posterior tiiangle. As this is done, the slip which binds down the omo-hyoid should be preserved for a little while. Tlie omo-hyoid itself should be cleaned. It Avill be found to divide the posterior triangle into two. The upper and larger is called the occipital, and the lower and smaller the R

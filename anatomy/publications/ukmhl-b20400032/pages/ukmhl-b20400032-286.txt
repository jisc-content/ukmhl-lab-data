'272 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. A great many of these lie upon the hyo-glossus muscle, and when they have been cleaned and the muscle defined, the next stage of the dissection, to reflect the hyo-glossus and see the parts beneath it, may be begun. The hypoglossal nerve has already been found ; its dissection may now be completed, and its communications with the lingual nerve on the hyo- glossus made out. The lingual nerve lies upon the upper part of the hyo-glossus, and may be mistaken for Wharton's duct, which is crossed by it. Wharton's duct may be recognised by tracing it from the deep part of the submaxillary gland. To see the whole of its course, a small probe may be passed into it through an incision in its wall, and pushed on until it emerges on the floor of the mouth. It passes beneath the sub- lingual gland, which should be cleaned and lifted up, to display its relation to the duct and to the lingual nerve and ranine artery. In dissecting the lingual nerve, care must be taken not to remove the submaxillary ganglion. By care- fully cleaning along the lower border of the lingual nerve^ a small reddish lump will be found close to the posterior edge of the hyo-glossus. This is the ganglion, and it will usually be found attached to the lingual by small branches. When the body is thin and fresh, branches can usually be traced from the submaxillary ganglion to the submaxillary gland, but its other branches to the ducts and floor of the mouth require to be found upon a specially prepared part. The lingual nerve may now be traced to its termination upon the front and sides of the tongue. The relations of the sublingual gland should be studied, and in lifting it up an endeavour should be made to see its numerous ducts. They are very delicate, and often escape notice. The lingual vein, instead of running with the artery beneath the hyo- glossus, usually runs over the muscle just above the

50 The Dissector^s Manual. [Chap. iii. it seems desirable to acquire a knowledge of them before making the skin incisions. The skin may be removed by the following incisions : (a) across the heads of the metacarpal bones, and over the thumb as far as the radial side of the first joint; {h) a vertical incision from the circular incision at w^rist, along the dorsum of the middle finger ; (c) an incision along the dorsum of the thumb. The skin having been reflected, the dissection should be conducted in the following order: Cutaneous nerves and veins. Annular ligament. Tendons. Eadial artery. Dorsum of fingers and thumb. Posterior carpal arcli. The cutaneous nerve from the ulnar should be looked for coming out from under the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris ; that from the radial emerging from beneath the tendon of the supinator longus. When they have been found their distribution should be carefully made out. The veins at the back of the hand in the collapsed state are very small. They are so easily seen on the back of the student's own hand, that he need not waste much time in their dissection. The attachments of the posterior annular ligament should next be examined, and the fascia removed from the surface of the tendons. It will be found that tendons <jan most easily be cleaned by scraping them with the point of the knife. Upon one of the fingers the way in w^hich the interossii and lumbricales are attached to the extensor tendons should be examined. The radial is the principal artery at the back of the hand. The course of this artery from the front of the radius to the place where it passes between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle should be made out. The artery passes beneath the extensor ossis metacarpi, primi internodii, and secundi inter- nodii pollicis, lying upon the external lateral ligament

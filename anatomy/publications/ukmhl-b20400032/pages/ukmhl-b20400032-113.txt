99 The Hip, Chap. IV.] The glutei must be cleared away from behind, and the obturator internus from the inside of the pelvis. The capsule itself must be cleaned, care being taken to look for a small branch from the obturator nerve, which underlies the obturator externus muscle. If the joint is at all stiff it should be soaked in water for several hours, or longer, according to its condition. To demonstrate its movements the innominate bone must be held tight on the table and then rotated in all directions; this shows that its principal movement is rotation, and therefore that it is capable of motion in every direction ; but it is concerned, as will be seen later on, in maintaining the body in the erect position. To demonstrate this, the knee should be bent, and the leg placed on a table or the floor, in a kneeling position. If the thigh be grasped in one hand, and the innominate bone seized by the crest with the other, the student will find that he cannot rotate the innominate bone backwards farther than a certain point. This is owing to the front part of the capsule becoming tight, and also owing to the state of tension of the ligamentum teres (Fig. 8), which the student has not yet seen. To verify this, the aceta- bulum must be cut into from the inside, so as to display the working of all the ligaments at once. This is best done with a trephine, but can be ac- complished with a chisel and hammer. The point at which the bone should be perforated is as follows : Take a line from the centre of the anterior inferior spine of the ilium to the tip of the spine of the ischium, and make a hole in this line, beginning about half to three-quarters of an inch below the brim of the true pelvis. This will open the acetabulum without materially injuring the ligamentum teres. If the student repeat the experiments above mentioned, he can verify what has just been described. The part of the capsular ligament which is made

3i8 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. xi. part of its base, formed by its first turn, protrudes into the middle ear. To show the relations of the cochlea to the other parts of the ear, the second section requires to be made. This is the horizontal one, and should be made horizontally through the centre of the internal auditory meatus and centre of the external auditory meatus. In making these sections, an ordi- nary fretwork-saw will be found most convenient, and in order to make them the temporal bone should be fixed in a vice. Bristles may now be passed into the Fallopian aqueduct. Eustachian tube, canal for tensor tympani, and, if possible, the canal for Jacobson's nerve. If the student has any difficulty in recognising any of the cavities mentioned above, he should refer to the figures. He should consult his text-book in order to find a minute description of these cavities; but he may remember he has to learn concerning them, (1) Their relative positions. (2) Contents. (3) Openings into them. (4) Blood-supply. (5) Nerve-supply. Having in this way obtained a general view of the dry bones, the student may return to the temporal bone which he has obtained from his part. To ex- amine the external auditory canal, or external ear, the eminentia articularis and glenoid cavity should be cut away with bone forceps, until the Glasserian fissure is reached. When the Glasserian fissure is opened, the small tympanic branch of the internal maxillary artery will be seen, if injected (the chorda tympani, if not too internal), and sometimes a few muscular fibres (laxator tympani) running upwards.* The processus gracilis of the malleus lies in the fissure, but * Many anatomists regard this as a ligament rather than a muscle.

314 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. xi. mucous membrane, mucous glands, vessels, and nerves should now be removed, and these muscle fibres traced to the tip of the tongue. The intrinsic muscles of the tongue consist of superior and inferior longitudinal bands, separated by very numerous transverse fibres. The superior longitudinal fibres (superior linguales) should be exposed by removing the mucous membrane from the dorsum. The lingualis is the inferior band, and has been already seen. The transverse muscular fibres are best examined by making a transverse section of the organ. A median fibrous septum will be seen in the centre of the tongue, from which the transverse fibres may be said to arise : they are inserted into its sides. Mucous glands are abundant about the under- surface and near the tip of the tongue, and may be met with as the mucous membrane is removed. CHAPTER XI. DISSECTION OF THE EAR. The whole of the pharynx, larynx, and tongue have been removed from the front part of the skull, which now consists of the temporal bone and the bones which bound the nasal cavities. Before de- taching the temporal bone completely from the facial bones, the student should obtain a skull, and mark upon it the exact position of the Eustachian tube. Upon the under surface of the base of the skull there is a groove, about an inch long, situated between the greater wing of the sphenoid and petrous portion of the temporal bone. The cartilaginous part of the tube lies in this groove, and moreover indents slightly the posterior edge of the internal pterygoid plate at

Chap. XIV.] F/SSUI^ES AND CONVOLUTIONS, 347 cut be made into the olivary bodies, they will be seen to contain a capsule of grey matter (nucleus dentatus). The olivary bodies conceal from view the greater part of the continuation upwards of the lateral columns of the cord. These columns, like the anterior, become a little larger in the medulla, and are called the lateral pyramids, or lateral tracts. The nerves which arise from the medulla may now be examined. The sixth arise between the anterior pyramids and the pons. The ninth, or hypoglossal nerves, arise just in front of the olivary bodies; the eighth pair, exactly behind them. After their origin, the eighth nerves lie upon a very flocculent-looking portion of the cerebellum, called the flocculus or pneumo-gastric lobe. The eighth nerves may possibly be confused with the seventh pair, which arise close to, but just in front of, them. HemisptaereiS of tlie t^rsiiti.â€”The most im- portant of the fissures and convolutions which cover the surface of the brain should be studied first, after- wards the corpus callosum, and lastly its interior. If great care be taken, the fissures and convolu- tions can be all made out upon a brain which has not been divided in any way. But if possible a cerebral hemisphere should be used which has been separated from the brain in the following manner : Place the brain upon the table with its base downwards. Open the great longitudinal fissure, and divide the corpus callosum close to the hemisphere which is about to be removed. Afterwards, divide the posterior pillar of the fornix and velum interpositum. Continuing to draw the hemisphere away from the rest of the brain, dividq on the same side the corpora quadrigemina, crus cerebri, and the anterior, middle, and posterior commissures which lie internal to the optic thalamus and corpus striatum, and which are by this time in view. To separate the hemisphere, the remainder of

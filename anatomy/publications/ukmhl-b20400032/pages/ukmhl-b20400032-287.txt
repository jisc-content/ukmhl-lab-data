Chap. IX.] Submaxillary Region. 273 hypoglossal nerve. The stylo-glossus may now be cleaned, from its origins to its insertions, and the next stage of the dissection proceeded with. The hyo- glossus should be removed from its attachments to the body and greater and lesser cornua of the hyoid bone, and turned upwards. When this is done, the following structures must be dissected : Lingual artery, and its branches. ( Hyoid. \ Dorsahs lingual. \ Subungual. ( Ranine. Middle constrictor. Stylo-hyoid ligament. Glosso-pharyngcal nerve. Attachments of the genio-hyo- glossus into tongue and hyoid bone. The lingual artery should be first traced running just above the hyoid bone and along the side of the tongue to its tip. The more the tongue is dragged out of the mouth, the straighter the artery becomes, and the easier it is to dissect. Beneath the hyo- glossus and close to the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone, a small branch (the dorsalis linguse) may be seen ascending from the lingual. The finger may be pushed into the mouth over the back of the tongue and turned outwards, in order that the relations of the hyo-glossus to the tongue may be properly under- stood. Before passing beneath the hyo-glossus the lingual gives off a small hyoid branch, which may be followed along the upper border of the hyoid bone. After emerging from beneath the hyo-glossus and where it lies upon the genio-hyo-glossus, a branch (sublingual) may be traced from it into the sublingual gland. After it has been given off, the continuation of the artery is called the fanine. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve is not easy to find just at present. If not seen passing beneath the posterior edge of the hyo-glossus, the student should wait until the stylo-pharyngeus is dissected, when it

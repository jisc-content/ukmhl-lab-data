Chap. VII.] Head and Neck, 215 frequently gives off a branch which runs up in front of the tube to the thyroid body. It should be sought for amongst a quantity of connective tissue, which is usually present, and represents the remains of the thymus gland. In the same tissue a number of veins (inferior thyroid) descend from the thyroid body to open into the innominate veins. The trachea, and oesophagus, and thoracic duct should be carefully examined, to ascertain their relative positions. The thoracic duct should be searched for, ascending from the thorax, deep down between the left subclavian and left common carotid arteries. Its walls have about the same thickness as a small vein, with which it might easily be confused were it not for its white colour. When it has been discovered its course should be followed, arching above the left subclavian artery, and forming a similar curve, until it passes beneath the internal jugular vein, and over the scalenus anticus, to open into the junction of the sub- clavian and internal jugular veins. In doing this portion of the dissection the jugular vein requires to be pulled away from the carotid, and care should be taken not to injure the left vertebral vein, or the great nerves which the thoracic duct is in relation with, as it makes its arch. Before leaving the upper aperture the student should take the opportunity to review the subclavian arteries as a whole, and accurately determine what would require to be removed to expose them. CHAPTER YII. DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. It is desirable that the dissection of the head and neck should begin at the scalp, for until this is

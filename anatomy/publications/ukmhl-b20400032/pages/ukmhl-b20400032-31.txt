17 Dissection of the Arm, Chap. III.] to learn all the surface markings. If he is unable to find an J of the Bony prominences which are men- tioned, a properly articulated skeleton should be referred to; and if still in fault, he should call in the assistance of his teacher or of a senior student. The surface markings of this region are : The clavicle. Acromion process and Spine of scapula. Coracoid process. Angle of sternum (angle of Ludwig). Ribs and intercostal spaces. The nipple : its relation to the chest wall and inter- costal spaces. Outline of pectoralis major. Interval between the pecto- ralis major and deltoid. Interval between sternal and clavicular origins of pec- toralis major. At this period of the dissection the body is lying upon its back, with the arms extended at right angles upon boards; it should be raised to a convenient height from the table by means of blocks. The out- spread arms are fastened to the boards, with the palms upwards, by means of string. No difficulty should be experienced in tracing, with the tips of the fingers, the outline of the clavicle, acromion process, and spine of scapula. The angle of the sternum is about two inches below its upper border (in the adult), and at the junction of the first and second bones of the sternum. The coracoid process is situated in the interval between the pectoralis major and deltoid. Upon the dead subject this interval is not easy to discern, especially when the body is fat; but upon the living person is easily found by putting the muscles into action. The student may take an opportunity to see this upon his own person. The same remarks apply to the interval which usually exists between the sternal and clavicular attachments of the pectoralis major. A reference to the attachment of the muscles to the clavicle will aid in finding these intervals. To feel the coracoid, the shoulder should be firmly

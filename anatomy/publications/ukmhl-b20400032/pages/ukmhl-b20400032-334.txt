As tlie bone is removed from the upper part of the Eustachian tube, the fibres of the tensor tympani muscle are easily seen, and its tendon may be followed into the neck of the malleus. If the muscle be taken hold of with the forceps, it will be seen that the handle of the malleus is pulled inwards, and the membrana tympani made tight. The same move- ment rotates the incus inwards, and forces the stapes into the fenestra oval is. These bones, malleus, incus, and stapes, are the chief contents of the tympanic cavity, which also contains the terminations of the muscles which act upon them, viz., tensor tympani, laxator tympani, and stapedius. The first two muscles have been found; the last will be more easily seen later on. Between the handle of the malleus and descending (long) process of the incus, the chorda tympani can be traced crossing from the Glasserian fissure in front towards the back of the tympanum. The remaining contents of the tympanum are, the tympanic plexus of nerves, a number of blood- vessels, and a mucous membrane which lines it, and covers over all the contents which have been mentioned. Nearly all the boundaries or relations of the tympanum can be made out upon the moist speci- men ; but whenever the student is at fault he should refer to the dried sections which he has before him. Outside, the middle ear is separated from the ex- ternal ear by the tympanic membrane. The inner wall is formed by the cochlea and vestibule. The interval between the outer and inner wall of the tympanum is exceedingly small, and the bulge (pro- montory) which the turn of the cochlea makes almost touches the tympanic membrane. Owing to this, very little more can at present be seen on this dissec- tion of the cavity; but upon the dried specimens the

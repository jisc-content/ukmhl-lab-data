The Pelvic Viscera, Chap, v.] uterus masculinus (the homologue of the female uterus), which is situated at the top of an elevation, called the caput gallinaginis. Some small ducts, some twenty in number, open from the prostate gland at a depression (prostatic sinus) on the floor of this part of the urethra. This depression is situated at each side of the caput gallinaginis. Below the prostate, as has been already seen, the triangular ligament is situated, and lying between its two layers is the membranous portion of the urethra, about three-quarters of an inch in length. Beyond this again is the bulb, which has already been seen in the perinseum to be the bulbous end of the penile or spongy portion of the urethra. The rectum must be slit open and examined, just as the other portions of the intestine were. There is nothing special to see in it, except two or three folds of mucous membrane (Houston's folds). If the body is that of a female, the vagina and uterus, when separated from the body, need further examination. They should be washed and laid upon a board; the vagina must be opened with a pair of scissors along its upper surface. Internally it will be seen to be covered with rugae, probably not very well marked at this stage. The cervix and os uteri will be displayed by slitting open the vagina. The student should look to see if the orifice is that of a virgin, small, round, or transverse, or whether it is large enough to admit of his little finger, and irregular and torn in outline. If so, it is the os of a woman who has borne children. A pair of scissors should be passed up the os, and the cervix and cavity of the uterus laid open. The cervix (neck) will be found in the healthy uterus to be about an inch, and the cavity to be about an inch and a quarter, or inch and a half in length. A ready mode of recollecting these measurements, which

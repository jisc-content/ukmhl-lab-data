166 The Dissector's Manual. [Cbap. v. If an incision be made into the liver substance, tlie portal canals which have just been described may be seen, if carefully looked for, and some larger holes (the hepatic veins), which appear as open, and not as collapsed, tubes like the portal veins. The very small lobules will also be seen on the surface of the section, with a small vein (intralobulai-) in their centre. They are polygonal in shape, and about a sixteenth of an inch or more in diameter. Surrounding the Spigelian lobe he will trace the cut edge of peritoneum belonging to the lesser sac. On its upper surface he can see the two lateral and coronary ligaments, and in between the latter the rough surface, which was in contact with the diaphragm, and is uncovered by the peritoneum. The liver substance is not quite exposed, but is covered with a layer of connective tissue called Glisson's capsule. It is as well to remember that it is not usual to see so large a surface of the right lobe uncovered by peritoneum as is represented in this sketch. The student usually finds it difficult to make out where the lateral ligaments end and the coronary begin. In this sketch, where there are two layers of peritoneum in contact, they are called lateral liga- ments, but where layers are separated by a portion of uncovered liver the ligaments are called coronary. l>issecti®Bi of mider surface of diapSarag-iia as far as tlie ^sof^taag'eal opening', and re- moval of stOMiacla and dttodennm.—Now that the liver has been removed, the under surface of the diaphragm should be cleaned, as far as the level of the oesophageal opening. To effect this, the peritoneum must be carefully dissected off' from the circumference towards the centre. If a good start be made, the hand or some blunt instrument may be introduced between the peritoneum and the diaphragm, and it can be rapidly stripped oif.

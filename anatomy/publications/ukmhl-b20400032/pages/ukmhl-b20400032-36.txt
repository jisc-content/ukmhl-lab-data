[Chap. HI. 22 The Dissector's Manual. ■foFStiie.—The clavicular attachment of the pectoralis major should next be divided close to the clavicle, and turned downwards and outwards, to expose The costo-coracoid membrane, and piercing it,^ the Cephalic vein. Thoracic axis, and Anterior thoracic nerves. The costo-coracoid membrane or ligament is a layer of fascia which stretches from the cartilage of the first rib internally to the coracoid process externally. Above, it is attached to each side of the subclavian groove upon the clavicle, splitting to pass in front of and behind the subclavius muscle, which is inserted into the groove; below, it sends a thin prolongation between the pectoralis major and minor, and a thicker one beneath the minor into the axilla. These prolongations join again below the muscle, so that the costo-coracoid membrane may be said to form its sheath. The cephalic vein is most easily traced towards the membrane from the anterior margin of the deltoid. The thoracica - humeraria artery may serve as a guide to it. This artery comes either directly or indirectly from the axillary artery which lies beneath the costo-coracoid membrane. The branches of the axillary artery are given off very irregularly. It is usual to divide the course of the axillary artery into three parts : {a) above the pectoralis minor, between it and the clavicle; (p) beneath the pectoralis minor; and (c) below the lower edge of the pectoralis minor. In the first part of its course one branch,* the thoracic axis, is given off. This artery immediately divides into an ascending, descending, and transverse branch. These are the arteries which pierce the costo-coracoid membrane. * Afterwards it will he seen that in the second part of its course the axillary gives oif two branches, in the third three.

242 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. close to the margins of the lids. When the fibres of the muscle have been found, they should be traced to their attachment on the lachrymal bone, and its relations to canaliculi and lachrymal sac made out (Fig. 34). If well injected, the small palpebral arteries may be seen coming from the ophthalmic and lachrymal arteries to form a circle round the lids. I>issects®ii of nose.—The skin should now be removed from the nose in a thin layer, and the blood-vessels, nerves, muscles, and cartilages dissected. The central fibres of the occipito-frontalis muscle can now be traced down the middle line, to become the pyramidalis nasi. This muscle will serve as a guide to the compressor narium, which crosses over the nose just below the junction of the nasal bones and car- tilages. As it is cleaned it will be seen continuous above with the pyramidalis nasi, and care must be taken not to cut away the angular branch of the facial artery, which lies upon the side of the nose. The other muscles of the nose, which serve to dilate and close the nostrils, are of small size. The student should first learn from a diagram or dissection the direction which they take, and then make the alse of the nose tense with hooks, and dissect them. All the facial muscles should be studied before dissection. The bodies which find their way to the dissecting- room seldom have the muscles of expression well marked, so that disappointment need not be felt if endeavours to find any of them are unsuccessful. When the muscles have been cleaned and learnt, they should be removed when it is found necessary, and the cartilages made out. The terminal branch (naso- lobular) of the nasal nerve should be looked for coming out between the lateral fibro-cartilage of the nose and the nasal bone, and upon the septal cartilage a small branch of the superior coronary artery (vide below), the septal artery, traced. A few nasal

The Abdomen, Chap, v.] imagine tlie abdomen emptied of its contents, and in tlieir place certain isolated masses ; for example, the liver on the right side, and a mass of intestines in the middle. These organs, be it remembered, are lying quite loose, like a heap of books upon a floor, or a heap of stones in a street. In order to prevent them changing their situation, except to a very limited extent when the body alters its position, they require to be sup- ported, and this is effected by folding the peritoneum over them. The peritoneum is usually described as a closed sac ; that is to say, it is like a pillow-case with- out a hole through which to insert the pillow. If this sac, consisting, of course, of two layers, be placed over the organs in question, and fixed firmly to them and to the walls of the abdomen on either side, the organs will be securely maintained in position, and immovably fixed there. In order to get at them when so fixed it will be necessary to cut through two layers of pillow-case. Cutting through the first will bring us into the cavity which the pillow would occupy, and we shall then see the second layer firmly adherent to the organ in ques- tion on its anterior surface, and also to the body walls. It is clear from this description that the organ which has been referred to will only be covered on its anterior surface by the sac. This mode of arrange- ment will be more readily understood if reference is made to the Fig. of peritoneum in transverse section (page 119), where the colon will be seen to be covered in the manner just described. But many portions of the viscera are quite mov- able, and they do not touch the body wall at all; they are suspended in a fold of the sac, just as a man might be suspended in a sheet, the two sides of which are attached to the ceiling close together, and are ad- herent all the Avay down until they are separated by the man's body. In this case, the viscus will be

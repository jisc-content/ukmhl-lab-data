Chap. IV.] The Dissection of the Leg. 55 him, lying loose on the front of the knee. Farther back, two more prominences (the condyles of the femur) will be felt; and if the knee-joint is healthy, well-marked depressions will be seen at each side of the patella. They are of great importance, as their absence proclaims the presence of some abnormal con- dition (usually fluid in the joint). Next, at the upper part of the internal condyle of the femur, a well-marked prominence, the adductor tubercle is found, which is of considerable importance, as a line drawn from it up to a point midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis, marks the course of the femoral artery. The prominences of bone round the head of the tibia and fibula, being almost all of them subcutaneous, will readily be examined with the finger. The various surface markings must be carefully compared with the actual points on the bones them- selves, and when this has been done dissection can be started.

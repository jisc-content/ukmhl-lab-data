i8o The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. v. of the rectum and bladder, after being dissected off the levator ani, the upper surface of that muscle will be exposed, and should be cleaned. It can be traced downwards to the side of the rectum, and farther in front some of its fibres pass beneath the prostate, under the name of the levator prostatas. These should be carefully cleaned. They will be seen represented diagrammatically in Fig. 25 of the pelvic fascia. Underneath this muscle a very thin fascia (anal) can be seen, which passes down to the sides of the anus, and can be traced, though with difficulty, to form the inner boundary of the ischio-rectal fossa. The triangular ligament, which has already been found and put on the stretch, should next be dissected. Its front surface has already been cleaned. Passing through both its layers, the student will readily feel the sound that indicates the situation of the urethra. He must carefully clean away the tissue that lies be- tween the two layers of the triangular ligament, and he may perhaps find, if his part is a good one, a round body about the size of a pea (Cowper's . gland), lying between the layers of the compressor urethrse, which should be looked for passing above and below the urethra. When these structures are cleaned, it will be clearly seen that the posterior layer of the trian- gular ligament is directly continuous with the recto- vesical fascia, and is therefore described by some authors as being formed from it. From the upper part of the prostate the recto- vesical fascia can be traced on to the back of the pubes (pubo-prostatic ligaments). The folds of recto-vesical fascia at the side of the bladder form its lateral true ligaments, and the ter- mination of these in front (over the prostate) form the two anterior true or pubo-prostatic ligaments. The urachus forms the fifth true ligament of the bladder. To understand these folds of fascia, if he cannot make

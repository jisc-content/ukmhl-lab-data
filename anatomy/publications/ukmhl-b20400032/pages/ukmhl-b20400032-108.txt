94 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iv. of the posterior tibial artery, the plantar cutaneous, and, accompanying it, a small nerve of the same name, which is derived from the post-tibial nerve. This should be traced as far as possible into the sole of the foot. If the foot is really a good one, some small arteries (plantar cutaneous) will be seen coming through the superficial fascia along two lines, about three-quarters of an inch from the inner and outer sides of the foot. By careful dissection some corresponding nerves from the external and internal plantar respectively will be seen. All these branches are small, and liable to be overlooked. When the superficial fascia has been removed, the deep glistening dense fascia, the jylctntar fascia, will be seen. It is not at all easy to clean, but can be readily traced covering each of the subjacent muscles. Near the divisions of the toes there will be seen to be some well-marked transverse fibres. When this fascia is removed by cutting it away from the os calcis and turning it forwards, the three subjacent muscles, abductor pollicis and minimi digiti, on either side, and flexor brevis digitorum in the middle, will be exposed. On either side of this last muscle some branches of the plantar nerve and artery will be seen. The superficial muscles must be cleaned, examined, and all turned forward like the plantar fascia. In so doing, their nerves and arterial supply will be divided, if care be not taken to look out for the branches of the external and internal plantar nerves and arteries which enter them upon their deep surface. The posterior tibial artery and nerve can now be seen, as they emerge from under the annular liga- ment, to divide into external and internal plantar. They must be traced onward some distance.

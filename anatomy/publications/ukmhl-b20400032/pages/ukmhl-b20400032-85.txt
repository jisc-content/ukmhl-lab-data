Chap. IV.] Dissection of the Thigh. 71 thirds of the thigh, and sends a small branch down in the substance of the muscle, which usually emerges at the opening in adductor magnus made by the femoral artery, and is then found in the popliteal space. This branch is not easily seen, unless a special dissection is made for it in a part which has been preserved in spirit. To follow its course the trunk of the nerve should be found above, and followed through the adductor from above downwards by cutting away its fibres. It enters the knee with the azygos artery. The pectineus, adductor longus and brevis^ must now be replaced in position; and on the under surface of the profunda femoris, when it is pulled upwards and to the outer side of the leg by hooks, three or four arteries (the perforating) will be seen. These can be easily traced to perforate the adductors, and so reach the back of the thigh. The three upper arteries vary somewhat, but usually run as follows : The middle perforates both the adductor brevis and magnus, the upper perforates the adductor magnus above the adductor brevis, and the lower one perforates it below the adductor brevis. The fourth perforating is often spoken of as the terminal branch of the profunda, and usually per- forates the adductor magnus close to the opening for the femoral artery, and ends in the second head of the biceps. The student must not be in the least surprised to find variations from the above description, as the internal, and sometimes the external circumflex, come off from the common femoral, or the perforating arteries may be fewer in number.

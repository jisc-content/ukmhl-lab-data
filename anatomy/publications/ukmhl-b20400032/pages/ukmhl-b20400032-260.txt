246 The Dissector's AIanual. [Chap. ix. have been found entering the posterior margins of the muscles, and converging towards the lobule of the ear. It will be found convenient at this stage to begin the dissection of the parotid region, and afterwards to complete the buccinator muscle and lips. Farolid reg-ioM.â€”By the parotid region is meant the part of the face which is occupied by the parotid gland. It is limited above by the zygoma, below by a line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process ; behind, it is bounded by the ear and mastoid process; and in front it extends some distance over the masseter, roughly speaking to its anterior border. When the skin has been removed, the following structures are to be sought for in their order : Lymphatic glands. Pai^otid fascia. Parotid gland and glandula socia parotid is. Stenson's duct. Facial nerve. Auriculo-parotidian nerve. Temporo-maxillary and ex- ternal jugular veins. External carotid artery and its terminal branches. Transverse facial artery (from temporal). Masseter muscle. As a rule, the parotid lymphatic glands are small, and easily escape observation, but they are of con- siderable importance. Beneath them is the strong parotid fascia; its attachments and its continuity with the fascia of the neck should be made out. It is necessary to remove this fascia in order to see the limits of the parotid gland. This must be done with great care, to avoid cutting through the branches of the facial nerve which pierce it. When the front border of the gland is defined, care must still be taken of the nerves and of Stenson's duct. As soon as this latter structure has been found, it should be traced into the buccinator.

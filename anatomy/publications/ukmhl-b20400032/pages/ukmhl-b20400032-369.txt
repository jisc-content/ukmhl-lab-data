Chap. XIV.] Ventricles of Brain, 355 white fibres from corpus callosum, which joins the occipital lobes together (posterior peduncle of corpus callosum), should be divided upon each side. The corpus callosum should then be turned forwards from off the posterior pillars of the fornix, to which it is adherent, as far as the junction of its middle and anterior thirds. Beneath the middle of the corpus callosum the posterior pillars of the fornix, which ascend in an upward curve from tlie descending horn of the ventricle, unite to form a single bundle called the body of the fornix. Soon it will be seen that the body divides again to form the anterior pillars. Where the posterior pillars of the fornix converge behind, they form rather an acute angle. This angle, situated just beneath the splenium, is bridged over by a few transverse fibres, and is called the lyra. (By some authors the transverse fibres are said to belong to the fornix, others say they are fibres detached from the corpus callosum.) The posterior pillars of the fornix should be divided, and the body and lyra lifted up, to display the velum interpositum which is beneath it. The veins of Galen should be noted, running along the centre of the velum. They may be seen to collect the blood from the choroid plexuses, and when the plexuses themselves are lifted up, other veins will be seen entering them from the corpora striata. The veins of Galen open into the straight sinus. In the middle line the velum interpositum should be lifted up, to expose the corpora quadrigemina lying beneath it. The corpora quadrigemina are four small masses of grey matter, lying just below the splenium, and upon the crura cerebri. The fissure between the splenium and corpora quadrigemina is the fissure of Bichat. Evidently, the velum interpositum enters the brain through it. The fissure of Bichat, however, is only the central part of a much larger fissure, which is

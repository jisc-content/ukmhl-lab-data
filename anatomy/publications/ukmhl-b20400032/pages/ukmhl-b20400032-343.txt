Chap. XII.] Meckel^s Ganglion, 329 spheno-palatine foramen. The branclies to tlie middle and inferior spongy bones enter the nose through foramena which lead into the posterior palatine canal. To dissect these nerves, and the small arteries which run close to them, the student should probe the mucous membrane of the superior meatus with the point of his knife, in order to find the naso- palatine foramen. Where the bone is deficient, the knife will meet with no resistance. Once found, the foramen should be cleaned of mucous membrane, and divided ends of the naso-palatine nerve and artery, already seen upon the septum, made out. The small nerve and artery which go to the superior meatus may also be seen. The posterior palatine canal descends quite vertically from the spheno-palatine foramen, but is still concealed by the mucous membrane and the vertical plate of the palate bone. The strip of mucous membrane, extending from the lower border of the spheno- palatine foramen to the palate, should be care- fully removed, and the nerves searched for coming out of apertures in the bones. They may be traced forwards on to the middle and inferior spongy bones. At quite the front part of the nasal cavity, and upon the inner surface of the nasal bone, the only portion of the nasal nerve which has not been seen may be looked for. Trace the nerve downwards from the nasal slit, where it has already been seen, as far as the anterior nerves, where it emerges between the nasal bone and lateral cartilage. If the nasal slit has been destroyed upon this side of the head, the nerve may be traced upon the opposite side by cutting away the crista galli and as much of the septum as is necessary. I>iS!§ectioii of Meckel's g^ang^lion.—Meckel's ganglion lies external to the spheno-palatine foramen, and, therefore, external to the palate bone. It lies in

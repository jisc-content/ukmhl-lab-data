336 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. xiii. chamber the posterior chamber of the eye. This is the sense in which it is used here. Most books on anatomy apply the expression posterior chamber to the space between the posterior surface of the iris and the front of the lens. The entrance of the optic nerve is towards the inner side of the axis. In the bullock's eye the entrance of the optic nerve in the interior is indicated by the diverging fibres, and by the passage through its centre of the central artery and vein of the retina, but in human eyes it presents the appearance of a white circular disc, slightly elevated, called the optic disc. Upon the antero-posterior section, the following points also require to be studied: (1) The way in which the sclerotic overlaps the edge of the cornea. (2) The attachments of the iris. (3) Boundaries of the anterior chamber. (4) Boundaries of the posterior chamber. (5) Ciliary bodies. (6) Position of the crystalline lens. The back part of the bullock's eye looks very like the interior of a mussel-shell, owing to the presence of glistening white pigment in the choroid. This mother-of-pearl-looking membrane is called the tapetum. For a full description of all these points the student should refer to his text-books. The handle of the knife should be passed under the inner edge of the iris, to show the posterior part of the anterior chamber. The withdrawal of the handle of the knife will probably bring away a quan- tity of pigment (uvea) from the back of the iris, which is abundantly covered with it. In the posterior chamber the different parts can be studied, either upon the vertical section, or upon a horizontal one made through the middle of the globe. The student should take another of the eyes which he has cleaned, and,

Muscles of the Face. Chap. IX.] 243 branches of the infraorbital nerve may have been seen upon the side of the nose, but being very small are frequently overlooked. Muscles of the face; muscles of expres- sion.â€”This group consists of the Zygomaticus, major and minor. Orbicularis oris. Musculus risorius. Frontalis. Corrug-ator supercilii. Orbicularis oculi. Elevators of the upper lip, viz. : Levator labii superioris pro- prius. Levator labii superioris et alae nasi. Levator anguli oris. Depressors of lower lip, viz.: Depressor labii inferioris. Depressor anguli oris. Quadratus menti. Buccinator. Platysma (a few fibres). The first of these, viz., frontalis, orbicularis oculi, and corrugator supercilii^ have already been completed, so that the muscles of the mouth may be begun. The arteries and most of the nerves of the face lie beneath the muscles, and may be dissected afterwards. Com- mence with the muscles attached to the angle of the mouth. The skin having been reflected, it is probable that the fibres of the zygomatici can be seen extend- ing amongst the fat from the malar bone towards the angle of the mouth. They should be cleaned, and their nerve supply, from the facial, which enters their posterior border, be sought for. In front of the zygo- matici, and nearer the nose, are the levator labii superioris proprius, and levator labii superioris et alse nasi. These muscles run almost parallel to the last, and should be sought for by incisions in the fat below the orbit, and extending from its lower margin towards the angle of the mouth. In cleaning them, they should be put on the stretch by pulling down- wards the angle of the mouth with hooks. The dis- section of the levator anguli oris had better be de- ferred awhile. The musculus risorius of Santorini radiates from the an^le of the mouth over towards the

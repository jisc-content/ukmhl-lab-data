324 The Dissector's Manual, [chap. xi auditory canal, vestibule and cochlea. The internal auditory meatus can be seen to be far too large for its contents. The extra space is filled with cerebro- spinal fluid. Its contents are : Dura mater. Arachnoid. Portio mollis. Portio dura. Portio-inter-duram et moUcm (nerve of Wrisberg). Auditory artery and vein. Unless the temporal bone has been preserved in spirit, the small nerves can hardly be made out. The facial is the highest nerve, and is rounder and whiter than the auditory. The small nerve of Wrisberg lies between them. The auditory artery can be seen, if injected, dividing at the bottom of the meatus into a cochlear and vestibular division. The auditory vein opens into the superior petrosal sinus. The vestibule contains the greater part of the membranous labyrinth, which, in a very good specimen, may be partially seen. The upper part of the horizontal section of the petrous bone should be looked at, in order to see the two depressions in the roof of the vestibules, and the small apertures of the semicircular canals. It may be seen that their vestibular ends have dilations, called ampullse. In order to see the cochlea well (upon the moist specimen), more of the petrous bone requires to be removed. It will be remembered that the cochlea lay with its base applied to the front of the end of the internal auditory meatus, and to the front of the vestibule. The intumescentia ganglioformis should therefore be lifted up, and the bone removed with the bone forceps, one blade of the forceps being applied in the internal auditory meatus, the other below and in front, just about the level of the tensor tympani. The petrous bone, being very brittle, will most probably snap off, and leave the cochlea in section. Upon this

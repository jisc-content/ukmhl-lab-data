Chap. IX.] Posterior Triangle, 255 in removing the skin, not to injure the platysma myoides, which lies immediately beneath it. The fibres of the platysma should be cleaned; below, it can be seen spreading over the upper part of the pectoralis major; above, many of its fibres have already been traced into the depressor anguli oris. The external jugular vein can be seen beneath it, lying on a layer of strong fascia, the deep cervical fascia. The platysma should be stripped from the fascia and turned upwards, care being taken not to injure the jugular vein or its branches. Only a portion of the deep fascia of the neck can be examined at present, but it is a structure of such importance that its anatomy should be clearly made out; roughly speaking, it makes a sheath for the neck. This sheath is attached above to great bony prominences, the jaw and mastoid process, and is continuous with the parotid fascia already dissected. At the lower part of the triangle the deep cervical fascia is attached to the clavicle, but sends a prolonga- tion beneath it to surround the axillary vessels and nerves. The fascia does a little more than make a ring round the neck. It forms sheaths for the muscles and great vessels. If it were examined in a transverse section made at the situation of the cricoid cartilage, which is opposite the fifth cervical vertebra, it would have, broadly speaking, the follow- ing arrangement: behind, it will be found attached to the vertebral spines; traced round, it crosses the trapezius and posterior triangle of the neck. At the pos- terior border of the sterno-mastoid it splits, to embrace and form a sheath for it. Uniting again at its anterior border, it becomes continuous at the middle line of the neck with the fascia, which is continued from the other sterno-mastoid muscle. In the middle line the fascia is attached to the hyoid bone above; and below, it splits to be attached to the front and back edge of

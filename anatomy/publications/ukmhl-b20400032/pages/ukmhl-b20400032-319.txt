The Larynx. 3^5 Chap. X.] If branches of the ascending palatine and pharyn- geal arteries get in the way in the first part of the dissection, they must be removed. In order completely to display the palato-glossus fibres, pull the palate to the opposite side, and clean the mucous membrane from the anterior pillar of the fauces, tracing its fibres upwards into the palate, and downwards into the tongue. The branch from the otic ganglion to the tensor palati can sometimes be found entering the muscle on its outer surface, if the body is a good one, but the nerves to the other palate muscles are rarely if ever seen without special preparation. The larynx: its appearance before dissection; its movements, and their effects upon the vocal cords and glottis.â€”When the pharynx has been completed, the larynx will be brought into view. Hemove with a pair of scissors the tongue, and what remains of the pharynx, from their attachments to the lower jaw and skull, cutting close to the bone. The larynx will of course be removed v/ith the tongue, and will now be easy to manipulate. Its construction must be studied before any attempt is made to dissect it. It is advisable, if possible, that the student should first examine a dried larynx; just as he examines the bones, and learns the muscular attachments upon them, before attempting any dissection whatsoever. Whether he has been able to study a dried larynx or not, by this time the hyoid bone, thyroid and cricoid cartilages^ and the epiglottis will have been recognised. If all the remains of the pharynx and oesophagus have not been removed from the larynx behind, they must be carefully dissected ofi*, great care being taken not to injure the muscles which lie on the cricoid cartilage behind, or the recurrent laryngeal nerve, u

i64 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. v. touches the back part of the right lobe. He will also remember that the duodenum and hepatic flexure of the colon also touch the under surface of the right lobe, in the order in which they have been mentioned, from behind forwards. To remov(^ the liver, divide the falciform and round ligaments with a knife or pair of scissors ; pull the liver out from the concavity of the diaphragm, and cut through the other folds of peritoneum (its lateral and coronary ligaments) which connect it with the diaphragm. Divide the vena cava at its upper and back part, and again about an inch lower down as it runs through a little piece of liver. Its whereabouts on the right side of the vertebral column will have been made out, and a little care will avoid any mishap. Cut through the structures which were contained in the lesser omentum, about an inch from the liver, which can be lifted out of the body for further dissection. Hissectioai of liver wlieii removed from toody.â€”More properly speaking, the liver requires rather to be examined than dissected after it has been removed from the body. If the student will refer to the accompanying sketch of the liver, which has been copied frOm Quain's " Anatomy," with slight additions, he will have no difficulty in making out its various parts. He must trace upwards the round ligament along the umbilical fissure to join the portal vein, and also its continuation (a fibrous cord), along the fissure of the ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava on its upper surface. The cut ends of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and duct should be traced right into the portal fissure, and the liver cut open (when all the rest of its surface is finished), in order that these structures may be seen

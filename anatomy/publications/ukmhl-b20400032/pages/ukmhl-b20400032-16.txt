The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. t. 2 In the first place, the student must provide himself with a good set of bones. He should possess piimself of a skull which is cut in two in a vertical tantero-posterior direction, and likewise of one which (is dis-articulated.

In a word, his osteology must always march in advance of his dissection. Taking for granted that this is the case, he may go into the dissecting-room, where he will be taught to cut the body up, and see how the soft parts are fitted on to the bony framework. In the ensuing pages, full directions are given as to the method of procedure in all parts of the body; but a few general directions, including a description of some of the commoner terms in use, will not be found out of place. A body is supposed to have been prepared for dissection by some such method as is described in chapter ii.^ and the student is supposed to have pro- vided himself with some instruments, which are fully described in the same place. When thus provided, a portion of the body ("a part probably an arm or leg, will be allotted him ; and, having provided himself with a set of bones

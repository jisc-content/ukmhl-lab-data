76 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iv. and nerve will be seen to pass through tlie tibialis anticus above, to join the patellar plexuses. By tracing the musculo-cutaneous nerve upwards, it will be seen to pass under the inner side of the peroneus longus, and, if it be traced through the fibres of this muscle as far as the head of the fibula, it will be seen to give off muscular branches, to supply the peroneus longus and brevis. Before going farther the student should look for the small anastomosing branches in front of the ankle, which can be seen at this stage; they come from the anterior tibial. Under the outer border of the peroneus tertius is usually seen the anterior peroneal, which perforates the interosseous membrane from behind, and is the continuation of the peroneal artery. These branches can be left for the present, and the whole anastomosis round the ankle dissected at a later stage. The whole of the leg below the knee must be learnt by the aid of some work on descriptive ana- tomy, and the thigh again gone over. The student will learn a great deal by showing his part to his friends, and losing no opportunity of seeing each structure, especially the smaller ones, upon as many bodies as possible. By this means he will gain great advantages in a large dissecting-room, as he will often see on a friend's part that which he has cut away on his own. THE DORSUM OF THE FOOT.

97 Chap. IV.] The Sole of the Foot. of the plantar interossei, which lie between it and the adductor pollicis. At the distal ends of the metacarpal bones some transverse muscular fibres (the transversalis pedis), often very ill-developed, are seen. All these muscles must be cleaned as well as they can be, and learnt. If the adductor pollicis be cut away from its origin, there will be seen underneath it the deep branch of the external plantar nerve and artery, with its digital branches. The main artery runs inwards across the foot to the outer side of the great toe, to form the plantar (arterial) arch, and should be clearly seen to join with the dorsalis pedis, between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. If possible the nerve branches should be traced to all the neighbouring muscles. Underlying the plantar arch are the interossei. They are usually so flabby that it is often a matter of great difficulty to dissect them. The student should refer to a descriptive anatomy for an account of them, and must clear away all the structures of one of the middle toes in order to make out their exact insertion into the e_:^tensor tendons and pha- langes. If he clear everything else away, he will be able to make out the insertion of both dorsal and plantar interossei at the same time. It is better to choose the third or fourth toes for the purpose. If the student turns his attention once more to the peroneus longus tendon, he will see its sheath carried back to the under surface of the os calcis as a white glistening structure, the long plantar ligament. This ligament, together with the insertion of the tibialis posticus and the deep part of the foot, will be considered when the arches of the foot and the structures that support them are dissected. H

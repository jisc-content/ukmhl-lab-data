no The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. V. Crest of puhes. Poupart's ligament. Linea alba. External abdominal ring Position of navel. Added to this is the perinseum. The deeper muscles of the back are usually included with the head and neck. Surface Markings. Tip of sternum. Edges of ribs. Crest of ilium. Anterior superior spine of ilium. Symphysis pubis. Spine of pubes. Before any dissection is started, the principal sur- face-markings must be mastered. The body is sup- posed to be lying on its back, with a block or two placed in the hollow of the back, so as to make the abdomen prominent in front. The student must feel with his fingers the edges of the ribs, and the tip of the sternum. At the lower ])art of the abdomen, the crest of the ilium should be felt, terminating in front in the anterior superior spine of the ilium, which is usually very plain, even in the very fattest bodies, and forms a well-marked promi- nence on the outer side of the upper end of the thigh. In the middle line, just above the penis or vagina as the case may be, the symphysis pubis can be easily made out, and if the body is not too fat, about | inch outside this the spine of the pubes (Fig. 14). The space between these two points is called the crest. It is very important to bear in mind the exact position of the crest, spine, and sympliysis. Running up the middle line of the body, from the symphysis to the sternum, is a line generally well marked on the skin, the linea alba; and from the symphysis outwards to the anterior superior spine is a well-marked depression, which indicates the line of Poupart's ligament. If the student lay hold of the lower part of the scrotum, and invert it from below towards the crest of the pubes with his little finger, he will feel his finger

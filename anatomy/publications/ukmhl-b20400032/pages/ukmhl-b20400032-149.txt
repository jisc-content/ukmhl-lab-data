Chap, v.] The Testicles and Cord. 135 cord only, and must be turned up out of the way on to the abdomen. It will be quite evident that the penis consists of three portions, a central and two lateral. The centre one contains the urethra; to make this clear pass a catheter down from the orifice. If the student has no catheter at hand, he can employ the blow-pipe in his dissecting case, and if he compress the urethra as far back as he can, he will be able, with his blow-pipe, to distend the bulb with air, and so under- stand how it has acquired its name. This portion of the penis is called the corpus spongiosum. The student should notice that it forms the expanded end of the penis, called the glans. The portion of the urethra just described is called the penile portion. To understand the relationship of the two side pieces (corpora cavernosa penis), which are placed side by side, and attached behind, as is readily seen, to the rami of the pubes, the student must cut off the penis in front of the symphysis, and look at it in section, when he will readily understand the arrangement of the several parts. Separating the two corpora cavernosa is the septum pectiniforme. To get a side view of this, one corpus cavernosum must be quite cut away, when the dense fibres of the septum, arranged more or less like a comb, will be brought clearly into view, especially if the parts be put upon the stretch.

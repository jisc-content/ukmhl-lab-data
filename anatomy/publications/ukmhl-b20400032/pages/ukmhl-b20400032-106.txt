92 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iv. nerve-supply from the popliteal nerve. This nerve is given off high up in the popliteal space, and runs over the popliteus to wind round its lower edge, to end at last in its anterior surface, as will be seen later on. The posterior tibial artery and nerve should now be hooked a little to one side, and the popliteus, flexor longus pollicis and digitorum, cleaned. When these two muscles are a little separated, they will display the tibialis posticus, which they overlap. After cleaning, and learning with great care the structures at the inner ankle, already enumerated, the peroneal artery may be traced downwards by cutting into the substance of the flexor longus pollicis. At the lower part of the muscle it divides into anterior peroneal and external calcanean. The anterior peroneal pierces the interosseous mem- brane to appear beneath the peroneus tertius, where it has been already seen. The external calcanean emerges from the lower edge of the flexor longus pollicis to run behind the external ankle, and anasto- mose with the tarsal branch of the dorsalis pedis and the internal calcanean branch of the posterior tibial, which runs beneath the tendo Achillis. At the lower part of the interosseous membrane a transverse artery should be looked for, joining the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries. The sole €>f tlie foot.—By this time the leg will have been removed from the body, and must be placed knee downwards, and the sole turned upwards, and nailed or tied to a block. The surface markings of the sole of the foot present little difficulty. The bony prominences of importance have been already ialluded to. {Vide page 77.) The external plantar artery is the chief continua- tion of the posterior tibial. A line drawn from midway between the inner malleolus and the os calcis to the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, will denote its course, until it turns to form the

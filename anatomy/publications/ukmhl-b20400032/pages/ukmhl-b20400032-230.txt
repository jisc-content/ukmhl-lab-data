The Dissector's ATantial. 2l6 [Chap. VII. accomplished it is not possible to remove the brain. To obtain a brain in the best possible state it is absolutely necessary to remove it at once, and place it in a proper hardening solution. Instead of doing this, another method may be adopted, which has the advantage that it hardens beau- tifully all the nerves at the base of the brain and pre- serves the spinal cord. This is a most important point, as unless the following plan"* be carried out a good spinal cord is never seen in the dissecting-room. Obtain a vessel which will contain about a pint and a half (an old teapot answers very well); an indiarubber tube, about twelve feet long ; and a strong glass or metal tube, about six inches long and a quarter of an inch in diameter. A block having been placed under the neck, a hole should be drilled through the skull in the following manner: Make a crucial incision down to the bone, about three-quarters of an inch above the centre of the orbit. With a drill make an aperture a quarter of an inch in diameter through the skull, and with a long thin knife continue it through the membranes. The metal or glass tube, as the case may be, should now be pushed into the brain until it is estimated to have gone in horizontally as far as the external auditory meatus. When it has been fixed in position a wire should be passed into it to clear its end, which, if possible, should reach the lateral ventricle of the brain, and the elastic tube can then be fitted on. The teapot should next be filled with spirit, and the other end of the tube fastened to its spout. The last thing no^' remains to be done, which is to elevate the vessel and tube to a height of about ten feet. Left for a day or two (the longer the better), the spirit gra- dually finds its way through the whole of the spinal * This method is used by Mr. Cook, who kindly showed it to the writer.

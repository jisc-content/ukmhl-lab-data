56 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iv. Make an incision in the line of the femoral artery, carrying it down to the junction of the upper third with the middle third of the thigh. At the upper end of this incision make another, following the line of Poupart's ligament, and at the lower end carry an incision half way round the limb horizontally. Care must be taken not to cut deeper than the skin, and to leave all the fat and subcutaneous tissue still attached to the limb, as it contains the sub- cutaneous vessels and nerves, which are the first structures to be looked for. The fat connective tissues which underlie the skin vary greatly in amount in different people, and ob- viously where the fat is greatly in excess, the sub- cutaneous vessels and nerves are more difficult to find. If the body is a thin one, on the inner side of the thigh, running down towards the inner side of the knee, will be seen a large vein, the internal saphenous. If the body is a fat one, the student must lay hold of the fat with his forceps, and, carefully removing it by vertical cuts, he will come upon the commence- ment of the vein, about an inch and a half outside the spine of the pubes. Some very small veins, which can be traced inwards till they empty into the large one, may serve as guides. If the leg is the first part which the student has undertaken, and any difiiculty is experienced, he should seek the aid of a Demonstrator, When the internal saphenous vein is once found, it should be followed until it disappears under the deep fascia (fascia lata). Close by where it disap- pears, some oval bodies (inguinal lymphatic glands) about the size of cherry-stones will be seen, about an inch below Poupart's ligament. The upper edge of the hole (saphenous opening) through which it dis- appears will probably be brought into view first. If the fascia be seized close to its edge, and dissected

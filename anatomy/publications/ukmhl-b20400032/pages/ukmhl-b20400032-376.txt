362 CHAPTER XV. DISSECTION OP THE LIGAMENTS OF THE SPINE AND SPINAL CORD. The student may now return to the vertebral column, which has been completely stripped of its muscles. It includes the sacrum below, and at the upper part the occipital bone, or what is left of it. The vertebral extremities of the ribs also remain attached by their ligaments. The dissection should be per- formed in the following order : (1) Ligaments which unite the ribs to spine. (2) Ligaments which unite the vertebrae ex- ternally. (3) Spinal cord and membranes. (4) Ligaments which unite vertebrse internally. (5) Ligaments which unite the head to the spine. Before any dissection is performed, the different curves of the spinal column should be examined, and its range of movement noted. It should be seen where flexion, extension, and rotation are freest. Nearly all of these movements may be ascertained upon the student's own person. Afterwards the occipital bone should be flexed and extended (nodding) on the atlas, and afterwards rotated. Kotation will be seen to occur between the atlas and axis. A spinal column removed from its connections loses many of its peculiarities, and, owing to the time it has been preserved, its range of movement may have become altered. The ribs are attached to the bodies, and to the transverse processes of the vertebrae, by the following ligaments.

The Dissector's Manual. (chap. v. i68 toiicttisi, and ©f (lifiplira.g'm l>eliaii«l ces^plia- g^eal ©s>eBiita§-.—The branches of tlie sympathetic system which accomj)any tlie intestinal vessels have already been dissected as far as it is possible, but the principal plexuses of the abdomen still remain. In order to discover the solar plexus, the peritoneum and connective tissue should be carefully dissected off the right crus of the diaphragm, the divided lower end of the vena cava being drawn downwards. Passing through the right crus (almost underneath it) will be found a white cord, nearly as large as the vagus (the great splanchnic nerve). If any difficulty be experienced in finding the splanchnic, it is better to lay hold of it in the thorax, where it ought to have been already dissected, and pull upon it; no difficulty will then be experienced in tracing it down to the large semilunar ganglion of the solar plexus which lies at the sides of the aorta, behind the vena cava. The solar plexus consists of the two semilunar ganglia on each side of the coeliac axis. They receive the splanchnic nerves at their upper ends, and at their lower ends are united below the coeliac axis by numerous nerve fibres. There is no difficulty in tracing the right vagus from the back of the oesophagus to the right semilunar ganglion, and seeing it make a loop with the right splanchnic (tlie loop of Wrisberg). If the body is a good one the student will have no difficulty in making out the plexus, and tracing numerous branches (if he spend time enough) along the various arteries, to the renal, suprarenal, and diaphragmatic plexuses, along the corresponding arte- ries. By tracing these nerves onwards, he will find a plexus situated around the renal vessels, to which the lesser splanchnic nerves usually go, whilst other nerves can be traced down the aorta; and from it

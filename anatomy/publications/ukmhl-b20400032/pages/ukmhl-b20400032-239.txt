225 Chap. VIII.] Removal of the Brain. are lifted up with the brain; their branches are too delicate to hold the lobes down. As the student continues to draw the brain backwards and support it behind, the optic nerve comes into view. This must be divided with a long, thin, and very sh irp knife, cutting downwards on the skull. The internal carotid artery is next divided, and afterwards the third nerve. When this has been accomplished the pituitary body must be removed from its fossa. To do this, push the point of the knife into the fossa all round the margin of the gland, and then with the handle of the knife turn it out, leaving it in connection with the brain by means of a delicate process, the infundibulum. It may be as well to remember that the circular incision opens the circular sinus. At this stage it will be found impossible to draw the brain farther back, owing to the way in which the cerebellum is held down beneath the tentorium cerebelli. This structure will readily be distinguished, as a process of dura mater stretching from the ridge of the petrous portion of the temporal bone underneath the posterior lobe of the brain, and separating it from the cerebellum. In order to divide it, push the point of the knife against its inner edge, close to the posterior clinoid process, and cut outwards along the margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. This incision should be continued as far outwards and backwards on each side as is possible. The fourth nerve will be divided just beneath the inner edge of the tentorium, where it lies concealed, and may be readily seen by everting the margin. Continuing to draw the brain backwards, the remaining cranial nerves should be divided in their turn : the fifth nerve where it lies upon the apex of the petrous bone; the sixth, in front of the basilar process of the occipital bone (here it runs forward at the side of the basilar artery, and may be seen piercing the dura mater nearly an inch behind the p

Chap. IV.] Dissection of the Thigh. 63 funnel becoming continuous with the sheath of the femoral artery and vein and the saphenous opening. This funnel-shaped process of fascia is divided by two partitions into three separate canals. The outer contains the femoral artery, the middle contains the vein, and the internal transmits the lymphatics of the leg into the abdomen. It generally contains a lymphatic gland, and constitutes the femoral or crural canal. It therefore follows that each of these three structures may be looked upon as being surrounded by subdivisions of the large funnel (femoral sheath). If the abdomen has not been opened when the student reaches this stage of his dissection, he must wait until it is in order to verify the deeper parts of femoral hernia which have just been described. DISSECTION OF MIDDLE AND LOWER THIRDS OP THIGH. The skin must be removed exactly in the same manner as it was in the upper third of the thigh. An incision must be continued along the line of the superficial femoral artery as far as the inner edge of the tibia, and a transverse incision made half round the limb at its lower end. In the superficial fascia the saphenous vein will be easily traced downwards, passing behind the knee, and receiving several unnamed tributaries. The external, middle and internal cutaneous nerves will likewise be easily traced down, having been List of Structures, Saphenous vein. External ) Middle > cutaneous nerves.

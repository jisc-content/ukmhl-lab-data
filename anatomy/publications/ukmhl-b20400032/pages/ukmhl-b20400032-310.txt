I>issectioe of prev^rtetoral reg-ioii. NecK. â€”The anterior detached part should be wrapped up in a damp cloth and guttapercha tissue, and kept for examination. The superior aperture of the thorax, if not already dissected, and the vessels and nerves more particularly belonging to it, still form part of the posterior portion. Upon it the following parts require dissection: Prevertebral muscles (longus Vertebral artery and vein. colli, rectus capitis anticus Spinal nerves (cervical). major and minor). Profunda cervicis artery. Scalene muscles. ISTo particular directions are required for the dissection of the rectus capitis anticus major and minor, and longus colli. They are merely to be cleaned from origin to insertion. The dissection of the superior intercostal artery was performed with that of the superior aperture of the thorax, and the greater part of its important branch, the profunda cervicis, was dissected with the back of the neck. It still remains to trace the profunda, beneath the scalenus medius and posticus, to the back. The scaleni should therefore be completed; the nerves which pierce the medius, viz., nerve of Bell and nerve to rhomboids, have already been seen. They may at this stage be traced through the muscle to their point of origin. To expose the profunda beneath the scalene muscle, the trunk of the artery, as it appears behind, will serve as a guide, and the muscle fibres should be cut through transversely, until the artery goes under the tranverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. The transverse process may now be removed with bone forceps, and the artery cleaned

As many of the muscles are partially attached to it, it is almost im- possible to avoid leaving their surfaces a little rough. The dissection should be conducted in the following order: Superficial extensor muscles. Deep extensors. Posterior interosseous nerve Anconeus. and artery. Supinator brevis. The superficial extensors should be cleaned one by one from the external condyle as far as the wrist. They should be separated, to show the posterior inter- osseous nerve emerging from the substance of the supinator brevis. This nerve should be traced down- wards between the superficial and deep extensors, until it passes underneath the extensor secundi inter- nodii pollicis to run down on the back of the inter- osseous membrane. When the back of the hand has been dissected the nerve may be followed to the back of the carpus, where it ends in a gangliform enlarge- ment (usually situated beneath the tendon of the extensor indicis). The posterior interosseous artery pierces the interosseous membrane at the lower- border of the supinator brevis. It immediately gives off a large branch (recurrent interosseous), which runs up between the supinator brevis and anconeus, to anas- tomose with the posterior branch of the profunda and the anastomotica magna. The continuation of the artery runs with the posterior interosseous nerve as far as the upper margin of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis; at this point it ends in the anterior inter- osseous artery, which runs through the interosseous membrane from the front of the arm, and accompanies the posterior interosseous nerve down the membrane until it ends in the posterior carpal arch.

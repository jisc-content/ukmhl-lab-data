2 74 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. ix. can easily be seen winding round its posterior edge. The stylo-hyoid ligament may be traced upwards from the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone. The lesser cornu can be felt with the finger, but it may be remarked that it is better to avoid touching the dissection with the fingers, as it dirties and obscures the different tissues. OissectioM of the posterior part of the suh- maxillmT triangle,â€”The dissection of this region is difficult, and will greatly tax the skill of the dissector. The lower jaw has by this time been manipulated in such a manner that its angle can easily be pulled forward with hooks. The sterno- mastoid should be pulled strongly backwards by means of hooks fastened to about its middle. If this muscle be very fleshy, a later stage of the dissection may be anticipated, and it may be divided about its centre, and its ends pulled backwards. The head itself should not be thrown too far back, but have a block beneath it, and be inclined slightly away from the dissector. To bring the external carotid into complete view, any remaining portions of the parotid gland should be removed, and the posterior belly of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid cleaned. When this has been done, they should be removed from their attachments to the hyoid bone, and drawn backwards to expose the external carotid as it passes beneath them. As these muscles are dissected back, branches from the facial nerve should be looked for entering their upper part. The remaining branches of the external carotid may now be completed. The posterior auricular has already been mentioned, and its origin from the carotid, just above the digastricus, will be seen as the parotid is taken away. Immediately below the digastricus the occipital arises from the carotid. It is crossed at its origin by the hypoglossal nerve, and runs upwards to pass between the atlas and mastoid

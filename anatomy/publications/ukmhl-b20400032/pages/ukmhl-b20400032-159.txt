Chap, v.] 145 The Peritoneum. vertebra. The vertebral column can be readily felt through it with the fingers. From this point it starts again and makes a bag for the small intestines, the neck of which is attached to the vertebral column from the second lumbar vertebra on the left side to the right iliac fossa, and is called the mesentery. To demonstrate this point, turn the small intestines to one side, and place a piece of string against their mesentery, taking care that it extends well above the upper end and well below the lower. Now turn the small intestines to the opposite side, and tie the two ends of the string together ; it will be found to en- circle the mesentery, and can be left for the present. Turn the small intestines upwards so as to display the under surface and border of the mesentery; the peritoneum will be seen to bulge down into the pelvis over its brim. It almost merits a separate descrip- tion, as it is quite a separate part, and liable to a separate inflammation, pelvic peritonitis. The pelvic peritoiietim can be traced from the rim behind, over the rectum, to form at first a mesentery for it, and permitting its movement, and lower down covering it only on its anterior surface. It is then reflected over the top of the bladder, to the abdominal wall, and runs up again to the umbi- licus, forming the parietal layer. The student will readily see, if he distend the bladder with air or water through the urethra, that when the organ is full, that portion of it which is not covered by peritoneum extends at least two inches above the pubes in the adult; hence, as will be seen presently, there is no anterior peritoneal ligament attaching the bladder to the pubic bones (Fig. 14, page 112.) Where the peritoneum passes from the bladder to the sides of the pelvic brim, its folds have received the name of the lateral ligaments ; and so, again, K

Chap. X.] The Larynx. 309 The crico-thyroid muscle has already been dis- sected from the front. The larynx must be tied or nailed to a block, with its front surface downwards, and its back surface facing the dissector. Connecting the two arytenoid cartilages behind, and probably exposed during the removal of the pharynx, is tlie arytsenoideus muscle, the fibres of which will be seen to decussate, i.e., cross each other very abundantly. Immediately below this muscle, situated on the back of the cricoid cartilage, are two muscles, one on each side, the crico-arytgenoidei postici. These muscles pass up to the posterior and outer angles of the arytenoid cartilages. If these muscles have not been already dissected, they must be carefully cleaned. One half of the thyroid cartilage must now be removed, by dividing it just to the side of its pro- jecting angle in front (the pomum Adami), and cutting it away from its attachment to the cricoid. Any other structures which still hold it can then be cut through close to the cartilage. Whilst doing so, look for the crico-thyroid muscle on its outer surface, and see that this muscle is partially attached to its lower border and inner side. If the handle of the knife be inserted into the ventricle of larynx on that side from which the thyroid cartilage has been removed, its extent and direction will be easily made out. Just in front of the insertion of the crico-arytse- noideus posticus, the crico-arytsenoideus lateralis will be discovered. Its fibres must be traced downwards and forwards. Just above the crico-arytsenoideus lateralis, and contained in the aryteno-epiglottic folds above the ventricle, are some muscular fibres, which will be seen, when the mucous membrane is removed, stretching

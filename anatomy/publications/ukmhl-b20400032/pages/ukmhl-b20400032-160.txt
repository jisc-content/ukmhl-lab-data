146 The Dissector^s Manual. [Chap. v. where it passes from the rectum to bladder the folds are termed the posterior ligaments of the bladder, and form the sides of the recto-vesical pouch. In the female there is seen between the bladder and the rectum an additional prominence, formed by the projection of the uterus. Folds of peritoneum will be seen passing from it to the rectum behind, and to the bladder in front. The pouch which is formed between the uterus and rectum in the female, is termed Douglas' pouch, and it is of great importance to bear this pouch in mind in connection with diseases of the uterus. Stretching from the side of the uterus to the sides of the pelvic brim are two well-marked folds, the broad ligaments; and quite at the back of these ligaments, situated on the edge of brim, two masses (the ovaries) about as large as a thrush's egg. Peritoneum in transverse section.â€”Just above the iliac crests and umbilicus (see Fig. 16) the continuity of the peritoneum should again be traced transversely. Beginning in the centre of the parietal portion behind the recti, it can be traced backwards along the wall of the abdomen, till it reaches the ascending colon, which it covers on its anterior surface ; it is then reflected over the small intestines forming the mesentery, and subsequently invests the front surface of the descending colon, after which it again returns along the abdominal wall to the point we started from. The next transverse section, which is taken through the stomach, will be found to be far more complicated, owing to the fact that the stomach has, during the process of development, turned over on to its right side, and by so doing shut ofl" a portion of the peri- toneal cavity, which has received the name of the lesser cavity of the peritoneum. The entrance into the lesser cavity has been so narrowed by the hepatic

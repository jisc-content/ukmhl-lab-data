The Pharynx, 299 Chap. X.] In order to display this, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve must be looked for; one or more branches (the pharyngeal) will be found coming off from it high up, and can be traced to the side of the pharynx. To about the same situation, a branch or two can be traced from the ganglion of the trunk of the vagus. These nerves can be shown by a little dissection to form a plexus, which in a very good body can be seen to receive branches also from the sympathetic, and some- times from the superior laryngeal nerve. From this plexus, or from the glosso-pharyngeal nerve itself, branches can be traced, with a little care, to the constrictors and stylo-pharyngeus, and, it is said, to the palato glossus and palato-pharyngeus. Amongst the branches of this plexus are numerous veins, which have been alluded to at an earlier stage of the dissection as the pharyngeal plexus of veins, which usually open into the internal jugular. Covering over the pharynx will be seen a very thin layer of connective tissue, which is derived from the deep cervical fascia. It must be carefully cleaned off, so as to expose the underlying muscles (the constrictors) which form the wall of the pharynx. If the student begins to dissect the constrictors near the pharyngeal spine, and works downwards, when he arrives about at the level of the lower jaw he will find that he is getting into the wall of the pharynx, instead of keeping on the outside. The reason of this is, that the pharynx is surrounded not by one con- strictor muscle, but by three ; the lowest of the three overlaps the middle, and the middle the superior, and it is in between the middle and superior that the student will find himself dissecting, if he does not take care. The stylo-pharyngeus muscle also separates the middle and superior constrictors. About an inch and a half lower he will find the inferior constrictor, which terminates at the level of

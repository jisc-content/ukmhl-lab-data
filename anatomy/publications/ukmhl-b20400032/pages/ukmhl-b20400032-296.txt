282 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. Koughly speaking, the jugular foramen lies beneath the mastoid process, and is concealed from view by the vaginal process of the temporal bone. It also lies behind the temporal bone, and in the suture between it and the occipital bone. In order to expose it, the muscles attached to the mastoid process are to be detached in their order, and the occipital artery com- pleted. Afterwards the skull must be sawn in such a manner as to enable the dissector to force the tem- poral bone well forwards, and so open the lacerated foramen through the temporo-occipital suture. If the parotid, pterygoid, and styloid process regions have l)een dissected according to the rules laid down in previous paragraphs, the dissection may be proceeded with in the following way. The sterno-mastoid should be stripped from the mastoid process and superior curved line of the occipital bone. The upper half of the muscle may now be completely removed, all except a piece about the size of a shilling, left where the spinal accessory enters it. The splenius trachelo-mastoid and digastricus are to be removed close to the bone. The occipital artery is to be com- pletely cleaned as it passes over the rectus lateralis, and, if necessary, removed. Before taking any part of the vessel away, it should be seen what its exact relations are, what it crosses, and what would have to be removed to expose it. All its branches are to be noted. The princeps cervicis is the most important, and by this time will probably have been dissected with the back of the neck. The bones require the following sections: the greater wing of the sphenoid should be cut away with the forceps until the foramen ovale is reached. Part of the squamous portion of the temporal may be removed in a similar manner, if it prevents the rest of the bone being displaced. A saw- cut should be made behind the mastoid pi ocess into

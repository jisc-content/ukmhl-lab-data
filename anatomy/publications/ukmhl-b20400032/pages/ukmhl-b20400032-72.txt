58 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iv. The genito-crural nerve comes forward external to the femoral artery and vein, and must be sought for by carefully scraping, in a vertical direction, with the scalpel in that situation; whilst the inguinal branch of the ilio-inguinal emerges at the external abdominal ring, just over the pubic crest, and passes down on the part of the leg, over that part of the upper edge of the saphenous opening which is attached to the spine of the pubes. The larger portion of this nerve goes to the scrotum, and is dissected with the abdomen. The external middle and internal cutaneous nerves all pierce the fascia lata, several inches below Poupart's ligament. No very definite rules can be given for finding them, except that it is advisable to begin dissecting at the outer side of the leg above, and clean the fascia lata downwards and inwards, watching very carefully on its under surface for the nerves, and only making very small cuts, otherwise the nerve will be cut away before the dissector knows where he is. The middle cutaneous nerve usually emerges about in a line with the femoral artery ; the external, close to the outer side of the limb; and the internal, which is small, just external to the saphenous vein. The position of the saphenous opening should be carefully borne in mind, as it is the passage by which a femoral hernia escapes. The coverings of a femoral hernia from without inwards will be as follows : Skin. Superficial fascia. Cribriform fascia. Crural sheath (femoral sheath), Subperitoneal fat (septum crurale *), Peritoneum. 1 fascia propria J of Astley Cooper. * Some regard this as an extra layer of fascia superficial to the subperitoneal fat.

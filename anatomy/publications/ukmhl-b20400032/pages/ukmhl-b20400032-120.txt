io6 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iv. experiment in the case of the hip, he will remember that he was able to lock the joint in position when the crest of the ilium was pulled back, owing to the tension that was exerted on the ilio femoral and ligamentum teres, and that the knee could be locked by ligaments situated principally behind, and not in front, like those of the hip. The crucial, lateral, and posterior ligaments bring about this result. If the student's part be placed with its foot on the ground, and the knee be fully extended, and pressure be made on the back of the iliac crest, he will find that there is no tendency for the knee or hip-joints to give at all; in other words, they remain automatically fixed. The ankle-joint cannot be fixed automatically, and so the leg will not stand of itself. To demonstrate all these facts requires a little care and patience ; but any one who has tried it several times will find no diffi- culty in doing so. The ligaments which produce this result are marked diagrammatically as black lines in Fig. 10. The weight of the body resting on the arches of the foot throws all these parts into a state of tension, and thus very little muscular power is called into l^lay, even in the case of the foot. The body can be very nearly balanced on the legs, and therefore, though the muscles up and down the front and back of the spine are in action whilst we stand up, they are not by any means in a state of powerful contraction. A corpse propped against a wall requires but a mere touch of the finger to keep it upright, if care be

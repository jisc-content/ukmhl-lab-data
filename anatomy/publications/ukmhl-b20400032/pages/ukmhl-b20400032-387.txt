Chap. XVI ] 373 Dissecting Questions. The structures should l)e removed as much as 2)ossible layer by layer. If muscles require to be reflected, they should, if it is possible, be removed by cutting through their attachments, as in this way an opportunity is afforded to display a knowledge of them. It should be also mentioned whether the nerve or arterial supply of the muscle requires to be divided during its removal. One example carefully worked out will illustrate these principles. Suj)pose the question is how to expose the popliteus muscle. This muscle is in contact with the tibia and femur almost over the whole of its anterior surface. Any student with a fair knowledge of bones, who had dissected a leg, could, if given a piece of paper cut to the shape of a popliteus, put it in its proper position, and a knowledge of the bony prominences about the knee-joint would enable him to draw its surface markings on the back of the knee. We may take it for granted that no one in his senses would attemj^t to expose it from the front, unless specially asked to do so. The structures to be removed are simply those which would be cut away in dissecting the lower part of the popliteal space and origin of gastrocnemius, with the addition of the division of the lateral and capsular ligaments of the joint, and the biceps tendon. The details of the answer would be more as follows : Make an incision from the external tuberosity of the femur, sloping slightly downwards and inwards, as far as the upper edge of the inner tuberosity of the tibia. From the extremities of this incision make a vertical one along the inner edge of the tibia, which can easily be felt, as far as the junction of the upper and middle thirds. The remaining incision should begin at the lower end of the last, and pass

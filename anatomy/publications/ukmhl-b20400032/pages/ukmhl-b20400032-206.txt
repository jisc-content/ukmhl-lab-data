192 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap.vi. The boundaries of the anterior mediastinum will be as follows : In front, the back of the sternum ; on either side, the two pleurae ; behind, the pericardium in the lower part of the chest, whilst above there is no distinct boundary line between it and the middle mediastinum. The deep layer of cervical fascia which passes down behind the sternum to the pericardium is looked upon by some people as forming the posterior boundary of the anterior mediastinum above. ©issectiom of toacR of steriium.—The student must now begin to dissect that portion of the chest wall which has been removed. The pleural must be carefully dissected off from the inner surface of the chest wall, care being taken not to wound the vessels or muscles which lie under- neath them. In the middle, attached to the sternum, with its fibres radiating upwards and outwards, a muscle will be seen. This is the triangularis sterni. Its fibres must be cleaned ; where this has been done there will be seen, about three-quarters of an inch outside the sternum, on either side, an artery and two vensB comites. There will be no difiiculty in seeing that they course between the cartilages of the ribs and the triangularis sterni. These vessel are the internal mammary artery and veins. If they are traced upwards it will be rendered clear that the vessels of the left side are contained in the anterior mediastinum, whilst those of the right are not, owing to the fact that the anterior medias- tinum is not quite in the middle line. The fascia must next be removed from the inter- costal muscles of one space, and when this has been dissected and learnt the muscles can be removed. On the superficial surface of the internal intercostal between it and the external intercostal) the inter- costal vein, artery, and nerve will be found. Towards

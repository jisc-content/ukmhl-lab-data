The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. 234 of these incisions are to be joined. With a mallet or hammer the orbital process of the frontal bone should be knocked forward. The roof of the orbit may be displaced with it, but usually requires to be removed with the bone forceps. The chief object in displacing the orbital process of frontal bone forwards in this manner is to preserve the pulley of the superior oblique. It is usual at this stage of the dissection to inflate the eye-ball. To do this, a blow-pipe (vide Fig. 6) must be forcibly pushed along the centre of the optic nerve. Considerable force is required to push it through the sclerotic (lamina cribrosa) into the globe. When it has been felt to enter the vitreous chamber, a wire must be passed along to clear its canal, and then the globe may be inflated. A ligature should be placed round the nerve as the blow-pipe is withdrawn, and the air retained. The most ditlicult part of the dis- section is now met with. Before endeavouring to make out the various structures, the student is strongly advised to make himself familiar with their relations. The diagrams contained in his anatomical text-books should be consulted, and, if possible, a dissected specimen carefully examined. The pre- sence of a large quantity of fine fat obscures the nerves, arteries, and veins. As soon as the orbit is opened, it will be seen that all the important parts are contained within a bag of fairly strong fasciu, which lines the cavity. This is the orbital fascia, and its upper part requires removal. When this has been done, the following structures require dissection . The muscles which move the eye and eyelid. The fourth nerve. Fifth nerve. Third nerve. Ophthalmic ganglion. Sixth nerve. Ophthalmic vein. Ophthalmic artery branches. The lachrymal gland. and ita The arteries, being injected, are not in so mucli

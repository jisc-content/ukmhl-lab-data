The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ii. How to prepare a body for dissection.— As soon as possible the body should be placed in a tank and thoronghlj washed with warm water. All the bair should afterwards be shaved off the head, face, axilla, and pubes, etc. To enable it to be kept the time requisite for dissection it must be injected with a proper embalming or preservative fluid. A fluid made after the following receipt has been shown by a considerable experience to answer admirably. White arsenic . . . , » 60 ozs. Salts of tartar 32 ozs. Carbolic acid (common black) . . 2 pints Glycerine ...... J gallon Water \ gallon Let the above ingredients gently simmer over a fire till the whole is in solution. A little less water can be used if it is desired to keep the body for some months, but much less must not be employed, or the fluid will not remain soluble when cold. This fluid will keep any length of time. It is usual to inject about three pints of the above fluid into a body (a large body will take consider- ably more); and if the subject is to be kept for some time, more fluid will be easily taken up if a day or two be allowed to elapse before a second attempt is made. Instead of a syringe, a can or old teapot raised up about ten feet, with an indiarubber tube attached to it, makes a good injector. When a day or two has been allowed to elapse to allow the preservative fluid to be absorbed by the tissues, the colouring matter should be injected. For this purpose a syringe must be employed, as it sets rapidly.

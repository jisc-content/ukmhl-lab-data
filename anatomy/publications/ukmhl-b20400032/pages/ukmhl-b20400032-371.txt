Chap. XIV.] Ventricles of Brain. 357 The student should begin by making out the boundaries of the third ventricle, and the openings into it. Unless the brain has been manipulated with considerable care, the middle soft commissure which crosses it will have been broken. If this has occurred, it is still possible to see the remains of it upon the middle part of the optic thalami, which it joins. The posterior commissure, which also joins the optic thalami and corpora quadrigemina, is small and white, and is often concealed from it by the pineal gland, which may be drawn backwards to expose it. The peduncles of the pineal gland are the two delicate strands which can be seen to emerge from it, and run along the optic thalami at the upper margin of the third ventricle. The anterior white commissure joins the corpora striata together. It is situated just in front of the anterior pillars of the fornix, so that at present it can only be partially seen at each side of them. The anterior pillars of the fornix will be seen descending towards the base of the brain. When the optic thalami and corpora striata have been completed, they will be removed from one side in order to see the anterior pillars descending to the corpora albicantia. Both the anterior pillars of the fornix and the corpus callosum descend towards the base of the brain, but the curve of the corpus callosum is some distance anterior to the curve of the anterior pillars of the fornix. At the base of the brain they meet again. The interval between the fornix and corpus callosum is occupied by two very thin layers of brain substance (septum lucidum). One side of the septum lucidum should be gently scraped with the handle of the knife, in order to expose an interval, the fifth ventricle, which is between them. A probe should next be passed under the posterior commissure into a canal, which leads from the third ventricle beneath the corpora quadrigemina to another ventricle (the fourth) which

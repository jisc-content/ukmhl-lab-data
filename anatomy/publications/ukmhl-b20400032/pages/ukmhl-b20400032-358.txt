344 Dissector's Manual. [Cbap. xiv. The different portions of the brain may be studied in the following order : (1) Base of brain. (2) Hemispheres. (3) Interior of the brain, and its ventricles. (4) Cerebellum. (5) Medulla oblongata and fourth ventricle. The anterior portion of the cerebral hemispheres is called the frontal lobe. Separating the frontal lobes is the anterior part of the great longitudinal fissure which divides the hemispheres. This fissure should be opened, in order to see within it the corpus callosum, which has already been stated, and will afterwards be seen to be the great commissure, or bridge of fibres, which joins the cerebral hemispheres together. In front it does not extend as far as the anterior extremity of the cerebrum, but presents a rounded edge, called its genu. Behind it is seen continuous, beneath the optic chiasma, with the layer of grey matter already mentioned as joining the crura cerebri together. The small area of grey matter in front of the optic chiasma is called the lamina cinerea. Upon the under surface of the frontal lobes a number of convolutions may be seen, and the olfactory bulbs. The latter are joined to the brain by three roots. As tlie arachnoid and pia mater have been taken away, no further dissection is required to show the inner root running towards the lamina cinerea, and the outer into the Sylvian fissufe. To see the middle root, the bulb must be lifted from the brain with forceps, and the root looked for entering the posterior and under extremity of the olfactory bulb. Between the tempore-sphenoidal and frontal lobes is one of the deepest and best-marked fissures (Sylvian) of the brain. If the Sylvian fissure be opened and traced outwards, it will be seen to bi- furcate. About five convolutions of average size lie in

All of these parts require to be dissected, but as nearly all of tliem have been found either in the thorax or higher up in the neck, they merely require to be followed upwards and downwards, and their relative positions determined. A proper knowledge of their relations is most important. The accompanying diagram may assist the student in gaining a proper idea (Fig. 28). The sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles are to be cleaned, and then divided and turned upwards and downwards. The great veins lie ante- rior to the great arteries. They are to be dissected in turn. The pneumo-gastric (vagus) and phrenic and cardiac nerves may then be followed between the subclavian artery and veins. The first and second portions of the subclavian arteries and their branches are most conveniently dissected along with the upper aperture. Their relations and branches are to be accurately noted. The vertebral arteries and veins can be followed to their entrance into the vertebral canals; as this is being done, another artery, the inferior thyroid, and its accompanying vein and right recurrent laryngeal nerve, are again met with. The artery and vein may be traced to the thyroid axis and subclavian veins respectively, and the nerve to the pneumo-gastric. The thyroid axis is given off from the subclavian just before it passes under the scalenus anticus. Two of its branches, transversalis colli and suprascapular, have been dissected in the posterior triangle. They may now be completed. The internal mammary artery should be

84 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iv. to all the neighbouring muscles, etc., whilst the sciatic is small, and runs down to be lost on the back of the thigh. Accompanying the gluteal artery are vense comites, and branches of the superior gluteal nerve, which should be traced beneath the gluteus medius, and to the gluteus minimus. It runs along on the outside of the gluteus minimus, just at its upper part, and between it and the gluteus medius, to end in a small nerve to the tensor fascia femoris, which was seen during the dissection of the front of the thigh. At the lower border of the pyriformis will be seen the great sciatic nerve, which is as thick as one's little linger; and close beside it, usually on its inner side, the small sciatic nerve, the branches of which to the gluteus maximus and skin have already been severed. Farther internal, and deeper down, another nerve and artery will be seen if a little cleaning is done. These are the pudic nerve and artery, and close by them is another small nerve to the obturator internus. These last three lie on the spine of the ischium, and ought to be traced under the great sacro-sciatic ligament through the lesser sciatic notch into the ischio-rectal fossa. To do this, the remains of the gluteus maximus, which was left behind at its origin from the sides of the sacrum and coccyx, may require to be cut away, and under it a large ligament, the great sacro-sciatic, will be seen pierced by a small artery. Accompanying this artery is a small nerve, which helps to form a plexus, the coccygeal, which is dissected with the ischio-rectal fossa. ( Vide page 130.) Emerging from underneath the great sacro-sciatic ligament the pudic vessels and nerve will be seen in the ischio-rectal fossa. (Vide Dissection of perinseum, page 131.) The lesser sacro-sciatic ligament stretching from the ischial tuberosity must be dissected at the same time.

With the naked eye nothing more can be seen of the structure of the choroid, ciliary processes, or iris. At the place where the cornea and sclerotic meet, there is a whitish line, about one-fifth of an inch wide. This is the so-called ciliary ligament. It is, as a matter of fact, composed of unstriped muscular fibres, and is now called the ciliary muscle. Some more of it can be seen upon the detached portion of iris and choroid at the point where they meet. The mass of tissue formed by the ciliary muscle and ciliary processes was formerly called the ciliary body, owing to an imperfect conception of its use and structure. This region should be studied upon proper microscopic sections. The last thing which remains to be done is to displace the crystalline lens by tearing through its capsule in front, and squeezing it between the fingers. Two facts concerning it will be demonstrated : that it is elastic; and that it consists of an outer soft and an inner hard part, called the nucleus. The arterial and nervous supply of the iris are subjects of great practical importance, and the student should endeavour, with the aid of his text-books and properly-prepared anatomical and microscopical speci- mens, to make himself quite familiar with them. He should also ascertain what the ciliary zone of blood- vessels is, and how it is formed. CHAPTER XIV. DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. The brain should be removed from the fluid in which it has been kept, and placed upon a clean board,

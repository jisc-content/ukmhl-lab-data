57 Chap. IV.] The Dissection of the Leg. outwards in thin layers, the nature and shape of the aperture will be better seen, and a thin layer of fascia will be visible uniting its edges. The fascia can be seen, in a thin body, to be perforated by numerous small holes, which give exit to numerous small arteries, veins, and nerves, and it is therefore called the cribriform fascia. In a fat body these holes are m filled up with fat that the fascia can only be made out by an experienced dissector. When once the cribriform fascia is made out, the edges of the ring should be farther traced, in order to make out their attachment. The upper edge (falci- form process) must be traced inwards to the spine of the pubes, whilst externally it curls downwards to pass under the vein, and becomes continuous with that por- tion of the fascia lata called the pubic, whilst the part of the fascia lata which lies over the vein is called its iliac portion. The Fig. at page 121 will explain the formation of this opening if any further difficulty exists. Entering the saphenous vein, close to the saphe- nous opening, are two or three subcutaneous branches, which, if they contain blood, can be readily traced to their sources. Descending from the abdomen, and usually dissected more by the dissector of the abdomen than of the leg, is the superficial epigastric vein. Passing upwards and outwards towards the anterior superior spine of the ilium is the superficial circum- flex iliac ; and in a contrary direction towards the pubes, the superficial external pudic. All these veins accompany small arteries, which, if injected, serve as guides to them, but if not injected will not be very easy to find. The first nerves to be sought for are the crural branch of the genito-crural, and the inguinal branch of the ilio-inguinal. They are very small, and are often not found, especially by inexperienced dissectors.

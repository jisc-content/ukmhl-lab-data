90 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iv. An incision must be made through the skin in the line of the posterior tibial artery, and a transverse incision belowj and the skin reflected. The external saphenous vein which has been seen in the popliteal space must be traced down and cleaned. For some little distance down the calf, the small sciatic nerve may perhaps be traceable. About the middle of the calf, the student will find, by dissecting carefully, the external saphenous nerve, and must follow it down to behind the outer ankle. If he cannot find it in this way, he should carefully trace downwards the external and internal popliteal nerves, and he will find that they each give a cutaneous branch. These two unite usually four or five inches below the knee-joint to form the external or posterior saphenous. The branch from the internal popliteal is usually the larger ; it is called the com- municans poplitei, whilst the branch from the peroneal is called the communicans peronei. The latter is sometimes absent. Some cutaneous branches from the internal saphenous should be looked for on the inner side of the leg. The superficial fascia must now be cleaned ofi*, the saphenous nerve and vein being hooked aside and pre- served. The rest of the gastrocnemius and plantaris should afterwards be exposed and cleaned. Immediately underlying the gastrocnemius, and blending with it in the middle of the calf to form the tendo Achillis, is the soleus, which is best displayed by cutting through the heads of the gastrocnemius. Branches of the popliteal artery and internal popliteal nerve can readily be traced into these muscles. The peroneal or external popliteal nerve should now be followed round the head of the fibula, lying at first internal to the biceps tendon, until it disappears under the peroneus longus

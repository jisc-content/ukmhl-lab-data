Cliap. v.] The Abdominal Wall. "5 The two lower branches which emerge in this line are perhaps the largest, and for that reason easier to find. The upper or hypogastric branch of the ilio-hypo- gastric emerges about two inches above the external abdominal ring and the inguinal branch of the ilio- inguinal at the external abdominnl ring, immediately over the crest of the pubes. It then passes downwards to supply the penis and scrotum in the male, and the labia in the female. The lateral branches will be found emerging in the mid-axillary line (a perpendicular line drawn from the centre of the armpit downwards, when the body is erect). They are rather larger than the anterior branches, but it is the lower one or two which are most readily found, viz., the descending branch of the last dorsal and the iliac branch of the ilio-hypogastric. The former of these passes over the crest of the ilium, slightly in front of the mid-axillary line. No very definite rules can be laid down for finding them, and it is only by diligent and careful scraping in the direction in which they run, and by taking care to remove the fat in a series of thin layers, as if it consisted of a number of superimposed sheets of paper, that they can be found with any approach to certainty. Kenaoval of fat-â€”The fat will now require to be removed wherever it still remains after the search for cutaneous nerves is completed. Kemove it by the same incisions as were employed in the case of the skin ; the tissue in which it lies forms a con- tinuous layer all over the body, immediately under- lying the skin. It is sometimes called the superficial fascia ; in reality it is a subcutaneous network, which, if distended with fat, is of considerable thickness; or may, in emaciated subjects, consist of nothing but a thin layer, resembling in appearance the deep fascia, which will next be seen.

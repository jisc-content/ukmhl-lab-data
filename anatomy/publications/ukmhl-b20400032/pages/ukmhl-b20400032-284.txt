270 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. In the meantime, the dissection of the front part of the triangle will be proceeded with. This dissection includes the following stages : (1) Structures above the mylo-hyoid. (2) Reflection of mylo-hyoid. (3) Structures beneath mylo-hyoid lying upon hyo-glossus. (4) Reflection of hyo-glossus. (5) Structures beneath hyo-glossus. In dissecting the parts above the mylo-hyoid, the facial vein should first be traced from the anterior edge of the masseter towards the internal jugular vein. It receives many important branches, but being small and collapsed, the student is not likely to make them out. It will be observed that the facial vein does not run with the artery. No difficulty will be experienced in tracing the facial artery, either down- wards from the groove on the lower jaw into the sub- maxillary gland, which it pierces, or upwards from beneath the digastricus. As the facial lies in the substance of the submaxillary gland, it gives off* numerous branches to it; these are the submaxillary arteries. Just before passing over the jaw, the facial gives off a branch which runs under the cover of bone and upon the mylo-hyoid muscle as far as the chin. This is the submental artery, and in cleaning it care should be taken lest a small nerve, the mylo-hyoid, be cut away. The artery serves as a guide to this small nerve, which, being carefully dissected, will be seen to give off" branches to the mylo-hyoid muscle, and to terminate in the anterior belly of the digastricus. Immediately beneath the angle of the jaw the facial artery gives ofi* a small branch to the internal pterygoid muscle, and before entering the submaxillary gland it gives off" the palatine and tonsillar branches, which may be left until the dissection has progressed a little farther. The mylo-hyoid muscle may now be cleaned,

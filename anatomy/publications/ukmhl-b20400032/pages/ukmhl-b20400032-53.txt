Chap. III.] Dissection of the Arm, 39 direction. When these structures have been found, the dissection may be conducted in the following order : Structures crossing the annu- lar ligament, viz. : Palmaris longus, XTlnar artery, Ulnar nerve, Palmar cutaneous nerves. Palmar fascia. Muscles of ball of thumb. Muscles of little finger. Keflection of palmar fascia. Superficial palmar arch, and superficialis volae. Nerves, median and ulnar. Lumbricales. Tendons and structures which pass beneath the annular ligament. Deep branch of the ulnar nerve. Deep palmar arch. Deep muscles of palm. A finger. All the structures which cross the annular liga- ment will have been seen, and only require to bo followed down into the palm. The palmaris longus ends in the palnlar fascia, which should be cleaned, ^ and its divisions followed between the fingers. The palmar fascia is very difficult to clean, but if the point of the knife be dipped well in amongst the fibres which compose it, less difficulty will be experienced in re- moving the fat and fibrous tissue from its surface. The muscles of the ball of the thumb, abductor, super- ficial head of flexor brevis and opponens pollicis, should be cleaned from origin to insertion. In doing this, care must be taken not to remove the recurrent branch which they receive from the median. It lies close to the radial edge of the palmar fascia, and close to where the muscles arise from the annular ligament. To dissect the muscles of the little finger (abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti) the palmaris brevis should be removed. The deep branch of the ulnar nerve, and artery, are to be carefully preserved, as they descend between the two muscles. The palmar fascia should be divided close to the annular ligament, and turned towards the fingers. The superficial palmar arch, median nerve^

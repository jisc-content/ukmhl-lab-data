34^ The Dissector^s Manual, [Chap. xiv. The apex near the pituitary body is slighly elongated, and is called the infundibnlum. The small apertures near the convergence of the crura cerebri are called the posterior perforated spot. The arteries which pass through them come from the posterior cerebral, and go to the third ventricle, crura, and optic thalami. If great care was taken in removing the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries from the crura, the slender fourth nerves may be seen winding round the crus in a similar manner to the optic tracts. The pons Varolii requires hardly any more dis- section. The fifth nerve should be observed piercing in, and the small white motor root of the nerve searched for. The groove along the centre of the pons is for the basilar artery. The under surface of the medulla oblongata, and the nerves which arise from it, are next to be dissected. This surface has upon it the Anterior pyramids. Lateral tracts. Decussations of pyramids. Foramen cascum. Median fissure. Olivary bodies. Arciform fibres (of Rolando or Soli}'). Sixth nerves. Eightli nerves. Ninth nerves. The two halves of the medulla are separated by a deep median fissure. Near the pons this fissure ends in a small pit (foramen csecum). Below, it is inter- rupted, about an inch below the pons, by a bundle of fibres, which cross from one side of the medulla to the other. The rounded cords at each side of the median fissure are called the anterior pyramids. They are merely the continuations upwards of the anterior columns of the cord, somewhat thickened. Just below the pons Varolii, and external to the anterior pyramids, are two small lumps (olivary bodies), one on each side ; the delicate fibres which wind round their lower ends are the arciform fibres of Kolando.

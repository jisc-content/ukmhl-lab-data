Chap. IV.] The Dissection of the Leg. 6i If the nerve be traced from Poupart's ligament downwards, its branches will be readily made out, with a little care. The student should notice that the middle cutaneous pierces the sartorius. If by any chance he has not found the middle and internal cutaneous nerves, he should endeavour to rectify his error by tracing all the branches of the anterior crural with redoubled care, and he may then discover the cut ends of these nerves, probably where they pierce the fascia lata. Whilst dissecting the anterior crural nerve, the student will probably come upon an artery (the ex- ternal circumflex) which courses outwards to wind round the leg between some of the cords of the nerve; if so, the artery had better be touched as little as possible at present. When the femoral artery and vein and the anterior crural nerve are cleaned, the floor of Scarpa's triangle will be fairly in view. Whatever connective tissue still remains to obscure its floor must be carefully removed from the subjacent muscles. The iliacus is the most external, and underlies the anterior crural nerve; next to it, underlying the femoral artery, and therefore invisible at present, is the psoas; and under- neath the femoral vein, and to its inner side, the pec- tineus. Lying on this muscle, a small artery (the deep external pudic) runs transversely, and should have been found in the course of the dissection. If injected, it can be traced to the scrotum. The adductor longus completes the boundaries of the triangle. On the inner side of the vein some more femoral glands, similar to those which were seen in the saphenous opening, will be seen, and may now be removed. If the body is an ill-developed one, between the pectineus and adductor longus, especially if the outer border of the pectineus be pulled inwards, will be seen

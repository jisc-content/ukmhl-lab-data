£hap. III.] Dissection of the Arm. 37 interosseous nerve and artery looked for between them, lying upon the interosseous membrane. The nerve may be followed into the pronator quad- ratus; the artery through a hole in the interosseous membrane. When the long- extensors have been dis- sected be- lltlyxl low the external condyle a ngiSSi small mus- Orl.iculai cle (supina- ^^s--'^--^- tor brevis) is to be seen, almost encircling the upper end of the radius. The mus- culo-spiral nerve ends upon it in the radial and ° posterior interos- seous nerves; the latter pierce the muscle. The rela- tions, origin and insertion, and mode of action of the supinator brevis should be accurately learnt. The student may be assisted by Fig. 7. The posterior part of the supinator brevis may be dissected when the arm is turned over. The pronator quad- ratus may now be dissected, and the palm of the hand bei^un. rig-. 7.—Supinator Brevis Muscle (Arm).

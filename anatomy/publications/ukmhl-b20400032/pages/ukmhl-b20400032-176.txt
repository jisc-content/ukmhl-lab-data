The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. V. l62 Winslow, towards the pyloric end of tlie stomach, at which point it turns upwards, round the stick which was inserted into the foramen of Winslow, to get between the layers of the lesser omentum. It will be seen to give off a branch that descends slightly on the duodenum, the gastro-duodenalis. The gastro-duode- nalis divides almost immediately into the gastro- epiploica-dextra, which has already been alluded to as coursing along the greater curvature of the stomach, and into a small branch, the pancreatico-duodenalis superior, which lies between the head of the pancreas and the duodenum, and anastomoses with the pan- creatico-duodenalis inferior from the superior mesen- teric. To expose these arteries the peritoneum simply requires to be stripped off. Porta,! veifi.â€”To the right side of the superior mesenteric artery, and almost behind it, is the corre- sponding vein, which, like the artery, has been cut across. If the student push a probe or his blow- pipe gently up its open mouth, it will pass behind the pancreas and reach the portal vein, which will probably need a little more dissection to expose it completely. By pulling the pancreas down a little with forceps or hooks, and tracing the portal vein downwards, the splenic vein, which lies behind the pancreas, will be found to join it. In fact, it is the junction of the superior mesenteric and splenic which forms the portal. Trace the splenic vein outwards, and about midway between it and the spleen another vein, the inferior mesenteric, will be found to enter it. The pancreas will need to be almost removed before the junction can be clearly seen. Corresponding with the pyloric branch of the hepatic artery and the coronary artery of the stomach, two veins will be found which usually emjDty into the portal.

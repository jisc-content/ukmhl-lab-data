The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. iv. 96 plantar artery. This muscle should be cleaned, and traced back to its origin on either side of the cal- caneum. It is often flabby, and easily broken across. The long flexor tendons must be cleaned and traced to their insertions, the tendo:i of the flexor brevis being cut away from one toe to show the rela- tions of the two flexors. This generally involves a good deal of trouble, as the tips of the toes are often dry and hard by this stage of the dissection. The lumbricales which are attached to the deep flexor tendons may be cleaned at the same time. A little more of the external plantar artery and nerve will be displayed when the tendons are pulled aside, but they are to be left alone a little longer. It is quite possible, by cutting away the flexor ac- cessorius, and by pulling the long tendons to one side or the other with hooks, to display the deep structures without actually dividing the tendons. But if the student finds any difficulty in doing this, he can divide the long tendons close to the annular ligament, and then he will easily get at the following muscles. If he then pulls upon the peroneus longus, he will see how it runs under the foot to make its insertion into the great toe. Just along the superficial sur- face of this tendon three small muscles will be seen arising, all more or less taking origin from the sheath of the tendon. In a good foot not the slightest dif- ficulty is experienced in seeing them; no foot is better than that of a negro, who is accustomed to run about barefoot. On the side of the great toe is seen the flexor brevis poUicis with two insertions., like the correspond- ing muscle in the hand; external to this the adductor poUicis; and running u]^ the outer side of the little toe, the flexor brevis minimi digiti. The latter is only a single muscle, and has not two heads like the pollicis. It is often mistaken by the student for one

Chap. IX.] Posterior Lacerated Foramen. 281 muscle of the pharynx, and a very delicate one to join the cardiac nerves. The sympathetic has already been seen lower down in the neck. It lies behind the carotid sheath, but very near the vagus, for which it may be mistaken. However, the sympathetic is much thinner, and ends above in a larger ganglion. The trunk of the sympathetic should be followed upwards to its superior ganglion, which will be found opposite the first, second, and third cervical vertebrae, almost concealed by the internal carotid artery. This ganglion sends numerous slender twigs to all the nerves in its vicinity. If the part has been hardened in spirit or nitric acid, these branches may be made out, but upon an ordinary subject only the largest can be found emerging from the ganglion. The internal carotid artery may now be cleaned, and lying between it and the pharynx the ascending pharyngeal artery may be found, but its complete dis- section may be left until the dissection of the pharynx. It will be remembered that the student was advised to defer the dissection of the tonsilar and palatine branches of the facial artery. They may now be found, and traced up. The palatine branch lies between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus; the tonsilar branch runs over the stylo-glossus, and dis- appears into the constrictors. I>issecti®ii of posteriw lacerated fos'ameii and carotid caiaal.—There now remains for dissection the structures which leave the skull by the posterior lacerated foramen, and, after this has been done, the carotid canal and its contents. This dissection includes The upper part of the spinal accessory nerve. Superior ganglions of the vagus. Both gangiia of the glosso- pharyngeal. Anterior branch of sub- occipital nerve. Carotid canal and contents.

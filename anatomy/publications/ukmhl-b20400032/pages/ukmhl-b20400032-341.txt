Chap.XII.] Nasal Cavities, 327 have been found, the mucous membrane should be carefully removed, in order to expose the septal car- tilage. The attachments of the cartilage to the bones are to be made out, and also, if not already done, the way in which the lower lateral cartilages of the alse turn in to form part of the septum. The fibres of the olfactory nerve are distributed to rather more than a third of the upper part of the septum, but are so very delicate that they are not likely to be seen. The grooves in which they lie can easily be seen upon the dried bones, and should be examined upon them. Upon the outer portion of the section the following things are to be made out : Nasal duct. Opening of antrum. Sinuses: frontal, sphenoidal, and ethmoidal. Spongy bones. Meatuses (three). Nerve supply. Blood supply. Infundibulum. Openings of ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses. Meckel's ganghon. There should be no difiiculty in recognising the three turbinated bones, one above the other. It should be observed that the inferior turbinated bone is about on a level with the infraorbital foramen ; the middle, with the inner canthus; the superior, just above and behind the middle. A small blood-vessel runs from behind forward along each spongy bone, and may be seen through the mucous membrane, if well injected, coming from the naso-palatine branches of the internal maxillary artery. There is a very abundant plexus of veins lying in the grooves of the inferior spongy bones. To demonstrate them in a proper manner would require a careful injection; being collapsed, the grooves in which they lie are quite apparent, and serve to indicate their number and position. Before removing any of the mucous membrane, probes or bristles

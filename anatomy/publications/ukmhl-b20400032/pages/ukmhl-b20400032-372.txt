The Dissector's Manual. [Chap.xiv. 358 is concealed from view by the cerebellum. Two flat bands are seen passing from the corpora quadrigemina (testes) to the cerebellum; they are the superior peduncles of the cerebellum, or processus a cerebello ad testes. Stretched in the interval between them is a thin layer of brain substance (valve of Yieussens, or superior or anterior medullary velum), from which the fourth nerve arises. This delicate nerve should be traced round the crus cerebri to its front, where it has been already seen. If the optic nerves be also followed backwards round the crus, they can usually be seen to divide. The divisions go to the corpora quadrigemina, but before reaching them they have small elevations upon them, called the corpora geni- culata. The fbiiFtli ventricle may next be dissected. This cavity is smaller in size than the others, and is situated between the back of the medulla oblongata and under surface of the cerebellum. Before cutting through the cerebellum from above to display this ventricle, its posterior margin should be raised and the medulla depressed, in order to see that the fourth ventricle can be entered in this manner. (This opening is sometimes called the foramen of Majendie.) It seems probable that the arachnoid and a layer of grey matter are torn through in doing this, and there- fore the foramen of Majendie is artificial. The names of the different parts of the cerebellum which form the roof of the ventricle may be learnt from a text- book by the more advanced student. Most of them can be seen at this stage. Concerning the fourth ventricle there should be seen (1) Its boundaries. (2) Openings into it. (3) Things seen upon its floor. Its roof having been examined, the cerebellum should be accurately divided in the middle line until

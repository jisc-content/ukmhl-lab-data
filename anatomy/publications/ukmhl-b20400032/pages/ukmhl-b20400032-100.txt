The nerve to the obturator internus, after leaving by the great sciatic notch, enters the pelvis again by the lesser, and supplies the muscle within the pelvis. Before passing through the lesser sciatic notch it lies almost in con- tact with the gemellus inferior and gives a branch to it. The student need not be very much disappointed if he does not see them, as they are easily overlooked; DISSECTION OF BACK OF THIGH. Surface Markings of Bach of Thigh. Great sciatic nerve. I Hamstring tendonSi Popliteal artery. | Peroneal nerve. A line drawn from midway between the greater trochanter and ischial tuberosity to the middle of the back of the knee (the ham), will represent the line of the great sciatic nerve. The popliteal artery runs almost in the saine line, from about four inches above the knee-joint down to about three inches below it. Just above the knee, on the outer side, the tendon of the biceps and peroneal nerve will be readily felt, and on the inner side of the knee the semimem- branosus, with the semitendinosus outside it; these are especially noticeable on the living body.

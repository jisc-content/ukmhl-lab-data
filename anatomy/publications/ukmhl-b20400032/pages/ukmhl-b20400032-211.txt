Chap. VI.] Posterior Mediastinum. 197 In order that the posterior mediastinum may be dissected, the right lung, or what remains of it, should be pulled forward slightly and turned over towards the left side, without cutting anything whatever. Through the transparent pleura which still re- mains on those ribs that were cut off at their angles will be seen the continuation of the intercostal vein, artery, and nerve that have been already traced in the front part of the intercostal spaces. When they reach the vertebral column, the nerve will be lost. It goes towards the spinal cord, and can be traced later on; but the artery and vein are seen through the pleura to ascend, the former to the aorta, the latter to the vena azygos major. This vein, which is of con- siderable size, will be seen passing upwards to wind round the root of the right lung, and when the pleura is removed, will be seen to enter the vena cava superior, whilst below it can be traced down to pierce the diaphragm. About the middle of the dorsal region, a whitish cord, or perhaps more than one, will be seen passing obliquely downwards and forwards on the vertebrse under the pleura. This is the great splanchnic nerve, and very possibly it can be seen to come from the sympathetic ganglia. These ganglia are greyish-white masses, a little larger than an apple-pip; they lie on the necks of the ribs, and are seen to be connected by nerve fibrils. If the left lung be lifted out of its situation, just as the right has been, the aorta, full three-quarters of an inch in diameter, will be seen lying on the left side of the bodies of the vertebrae. The other structures that have been already seen on the right side will be seen on the left, excepting the splanchnic nerve, which is concealed by the aorta and the vena azygos, which only comes up as high as the sixth dorsal vertebra, and is not very noticeable

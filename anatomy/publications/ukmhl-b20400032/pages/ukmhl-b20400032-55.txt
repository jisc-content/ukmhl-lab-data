Chap. III.] Dissection of the Arm. 41 enters the palm, coming from the back of the hand, between the deep head of the flexor brevis and ad- ductor pollicis, to uiiite with the deep branch of the ulnar to form the deep arch. The deep head of the flexor brevis pollicis and abductoT pollicis should be traced from origin to in- sertion, and the thecal sheath of one of the fingers dissected. The arrangement of the fibres of the theca should be examined. The part opposite the middle of phalanges, where the theca is strongest, is called vaginalia. Opposite the phalangeal joints the fibres form a cross, constituting the ligamenta cruciata. The thin part of the vaginalis, that near the joints, is sometimes called annularis. The theca should afterwards be split open, in order to examine the arrangement and attachment of the flexor tendons. The synovial sheath which surrounds them is, in the case of the thumb, derived from a very large synovial sac, which surrounds the flexor tendons in the arm. The sac extends from the junction of the lower with the middle third of the arm into the palm, and is called the great carpal bursa. After passing beneath the annular ligament, it sends, as was said before, prolongations along the thumb and little finger. The synovial sheaths which surround the tendons of the index, ring, and middle fingers, come from a common sac, which is situated opposite the base of the fingers. I>issecti®ii ©f tlie superficial msiscles of tlie back.—The muscles of the back which act upon the upper extremity are usually dissected by the stu- dent in dissecting the arm. The time at which the body is turned over to permit their dissection, varies in diflerent dissecting-rooms. (Vide table, page 16.) The body should be turned over upon its abdomen, and blocks placed under the chest and pelvis. The head should hang down somewhat, in order to put the

The student will then see how different a piece of intestine is which is covered with peritoneum from, one which is not so covered. Kow that the small intestines with their mesentery- are removed, the student should examine once more the attachment of the mesentery, which he can easily get at; and clean with a piece of tow or a sponge the peritoneal cavity. I>issecti®ia of Istrge mtestme.—To get at this portion of the intestinal tract the great omentum must be turned upwards and stretched as far as it can be, without tearing it, over the edges of the ribs; a good view will then be obtained of all the large intes- tine as far as the rectum. The right half of the large intestine is all supplied by the superior mesenteric artery, from which the ilio-colic, colica dextra, and media are derived, whilst the colica sinistra, sigmoidea, and superior hsemorrhoidal are derived from the inferior mesenteric artery. These vessels will all be seen, almost certainly before the peritoneum is divided, supplying those portions of the intestine which their name indicates, and they must be cleaned along with the accompanying veins, and also the nerves if they can be found. If the nerves were found in the mesentery they ought also to be found here. If the subject is so fat that the vessels cannot be seen through the fat, they must be traced downwards from the trunk of the superior mesenteric, which was found when the small intestines were dissected. The colica media will be found to anastomose so freely with the sinistra and dextra, that it is difficult to know exactly where one ceases and the other begins. When the dissection of the large intestine, in- cluding the csecum and sigmoid flexure, is complete, its position and relations should be once more passed

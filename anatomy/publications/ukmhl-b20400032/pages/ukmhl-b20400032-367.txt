Ventricles of Brain. 353 Chap. XIV.] choroid plexuses. At present the choroid plexus can be seen externally disappearing from view into the descending, or middle, horn of the ventricle. Internally its pia mater (velum interpositum) is lost to view beneath the posterior pillars of the fornix and corpus callosum. The finger (or handle of knife) may now be introduced into the anterior horn of the ventricle, and its length and direction ascertained, and its roof taken away. J^ext, the posterior horn should be opened in a similar way. There is a spur-shaped elevation upon its inner wall, called the hippocampus minor, or calcar. The handle of the knife should be introduced into the calcarine fissure, to see that the eminence is caused by the closeness of the bottom of the fissure to the interior of the ventricle. If the knife be pushed well in, the calcar becomes more prominent. Before touching the choroid plexus, the descending horn of the lateral ventricle should be examined. The direction of the posterior pillar of the fornix, or of the choroid plexus, will serve as a guide. Although they lie beneath the choroid plexus and velum interpositum, two lumps, about as big as a pigeon's egg, may be easily seen protruding into the lateral ventricle. The most anterior one (corpus striatum), which is dark- grey in colour, has been already mentioned. The point already noticed may be confirmed, that a needle passed through the anterior perforated spots pierces it. Another pin may be passed through the posterior elevation (optic thalamus) in order to see that it pierces the crus. The middle, or descending horn, of the lateral ventricle descends, at first backwards and outwards, then forwards and inwards, around the posterior edge of the optic thalamus, until, at its termination, it is quite beneath it. The brain substance should therefore be cut away from the side of the hemisphere external to the optic thalamus, in such a manner as to expose the descending horn. The X

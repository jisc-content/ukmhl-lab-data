98 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iv. During the dissection of the leg, which has just been described, it has probably been removed from the trunk, to suit the convenience of the dissector of the abdomen {vide page 175), so that it can now be turned over in any direction or position by the stu- dent who is working at it. Before proceeding to examine the joints and liga- ments, it will be better thoroughly to master the soft parts which have been dissected, as they Avill shortly need to be cut away. Points to which attention may now be easily directed are the various anastomoses of arteries round joints, which, though alluded to before, have not been thoroughly dissected out. The annular liga- ments, too, which bind down the tendons round the ankle-joint, must be carefully examined, and the sheaths themselves laid open by pushing a knife on scissors through them, from above downwards. In this way the student will easily see for himself which tendons occupy separate sheaths, and which do not. In examining those sheaths over the front of the ankle, the student should be very careful not to injure the anterior tibial nerve. It requires to be dissected very carefully if the nerve to the ankle-joint is to be found. The nerves of the joints of the foot are not likely to be seen in a dissecting-room body. DISSECTION OF LIGAMENTS OF LEG. The Mp.â€”The iliacus, psoas, and pectineus must be cleared away from the front of the hip-joint. Underneath the psoas a bursa is often seen, the extent of which must be determined by passing into it the handle of the knife, and exploring its size. Care should be taken to make out whether it communicates with the hip-joint; it does so sometimes by a small aperture.

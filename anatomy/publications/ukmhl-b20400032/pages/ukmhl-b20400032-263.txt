249 Chap. IX.] Pterygoid Region. Zygoma. ^ Lower jaw and temporo- maxillary articulation. Masseter; its nerve and artery. Temporal muscle and fascia. Pterygoid muscles. Internal lateral ligament of the jaw. Remainder of parotid gland. Internal maxillary artery branches in first and second parts of its course. Internal maxillary vein. Inferior division of fifth nerve. Otic ganglion. The masseter has been by this time fairly-well exposed, but before doing more at it the student should carefully note the various structures which lie upon it. When this has been done, they should be removed one by one from its surface. Stenson's duct may be cut and turned forwards, and the other vessels and nerves backwards. The student must provide himself with a Hey's saw, bone forceps, and an elevator. The first two have been already mentioned; the latter is simply a slightly-curved bar of steel, with somewhat sharpened and roughened ends. This instrument is by no means essential, but will be found convenient for levering up detached portions of bone. With the Hey's saw divide the zygoma first, in front of the tubercle which is found at its inner end ; tubercle of zygoma, next the malar bone, must be divided in front of the origin of the masseter. This cut should slope downwards a little below and external to the orbit (i and 2, Fig. 35). The arch of the zygoma, with the masseter at- tached to it, may now be turned down. Before this is done, the masseteric nerve and artery should be cleaned and afterwards divided. As the masseter is turned down, its deep fibres attached to the inner surface of the zygoma are brought into view. The coronoid process is next to be cut ofi" in such a manner as to take away with it all the insertion of the temporal muscle. This may be accomplished by an oblique incision from the middle of the sigmoid notch

200 T'he Dissector's Manual. [Chap. vi. dissected. Their general course, including their relationship to the roots of the lungs, will have been sufficiently made out. The middle medisistiimm occupies the re- mainder of the chest. The anterior and posterior mediastina have been so thoroughly dissected and learnt, that the student will have no difficulty in making out the relations, position, and contents of the middle mediastinum. The smaller structures which are contained in it, and the dissection of the heart and trachea, will be returned to later on. The phrenic nerve.â€”Unlike the vagus, which passes behind the root of the lung, the phrenic nerve though entering the chest close to it, passes in front of the root of the lung, courses down the outer wall of the middle mediastinum, lying on the outside of the pericardium, and then pierces the diaphragm. There will be no difficulty in finding it on the side of the pericardium, and then tracing it upwards and down- wards. There is a small artery, comes nervi phrenici, which accompanies it, and which forms a ready guide to its position. If the pericardium is still untouched, it must be opened by a longitudinal incision extending upwards from the apex of the heart. If the body be perfectly fresh a few spoonfuls of fluid will be found in it; but it is rare to see this in the dissecting-room. Examine carefully the position in which the heart lies in the body, as the subsequent dissection to display the nerve plexuses will render this impossible later on. The nerve plexuses of tlie thorax will be dissected next. They are as follows, and may be dis- sected in the following order : Cardiac plexuses (superficial and deep) Coronary plexus. Pulmonary plexuses (anterior and posterior). (Esophageal plexus.

78 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. iv. great and second toe, and a transverse incision across the bases of the toes. An additional central incision should be made down one or two of the toes. The internal saphenous vein is easily seen, forming an arch over the base of the metatarsal bones, and should be followed outwards until it joins the external saphenous below the outer malleolus. The internal saphenous nerve must next be traced to its destination on the ball of the great toe, and the two branches of the musculo-cutaneous to supply the inner side of the great toe, and the second, third, and fourth clefts. The first cleft is supplied by a branch of the ante- rior tibial, which becomes cutaneous at the base of the cleft. With a little care it can be found by scraping carefully at the base of the cleft or on the outer side of the great toe. If the student fail to find it in this way, he will be obliged to wait till he has traced the anterior tibial downwards to this point. On the outer side of the foot, close by the external saphenous vein, will be found the external saphenous nerve, which supplies the outer side of the little toe and outer side of foot. If possible, cutaneous nerves and veins should not be cut away, as they are a little complicated, and therefore difficult to learn. The subcutaneous fat and areolar tissue should be all carefully cleaned away, and the deep fascia ex- posed. The thickened part of this fascia, which forms the annular ligament above the ankle, has already been dissected and preserved ; there is another portion of the annular ligament below the ankle. This por- tion of the so-called annular ligament is Y-shaped. The tail of the Y is attached to the upper surface of the OS calcis. The upper limb of the Y to the internal

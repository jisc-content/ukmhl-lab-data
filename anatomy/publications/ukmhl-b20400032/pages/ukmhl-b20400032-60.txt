46 The Dissector's Manual. [Ch.ap. iii. turn. The acromion process should be sawn through at its junction with the spine of the scapula, and turned out of the way to permit the insertion of the supraspinatus to be seen. When this has been cleaned, this muscle and the infraspinatus should be removed from their attachments to the scapula, in order that the suprascapular artery and nerve and the dorsalis scapulae artery may be seen anastomosing. The suprascapular artery usually passes over the supra- scapular ligament which bridges over the suprascapular notch. The suprascapular nerve usually passes under the ligament, and therefore through the notch. They both wind round the edge of the spine of the scapula, the artery anastomosing with the dorsalis scapulae, which emerges from beneath the teres minor. This artery was previously found in front, and appeared to pass through the triangular muscular interval. Evi- dently it does not pass completely through. JDissectioii ©f tlie fesaclc of the OTm.—The skin may now be stripped from the back of the arm as far as the elbow. A few small cutaneous branches may be traced from the musculo-spiral nerve into the subcutaneous tissue of this region. The triceps should first be completely and carefully cleaned from origin to insertion, and then the nnisculo- spiral nerve and superior profunda artery dissected. The branches of the musculo-spiral have been nearly all made out; they may be classified as follows: Branches given off before the nerve enters the musculo-spiral groove, viz., internal cutaneous nerve and branches, to inner and middle heads of triceps. In the musculo- spiral groove is given off a large branch to the triceps and anconeus; externally, and outside the groove, are given off two cutaneous branches, and branches to the supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior, and sometimes the brachialis anticus. The nerve to the inner head of the triceps (ulnar collateral nerve)

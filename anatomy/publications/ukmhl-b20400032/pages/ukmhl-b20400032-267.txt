Chap. IX.] Triangles of the Neck. 253 internal pterygoid, be traced up towards its origin from the trunk of the inferior division of the fifth, a swelling will be found upon it. This is the otic ganglion. Upon the ordinary dissecting-room parts it is not usual to be able to discover the branches which enter and leave the ganglion; if this is desired to be done, the pterygoid region must be specially hardened in spirit or nitric acid. The gustatory and inferior dental nerves may now be traced, run- ning downwards and forwards from between the two pterygoid muscles. Carefully following the posterior border of the gustatory nerve, the chorda tympani will be found, and may be seen passing upwards until it disappears close to the spinous process of the sphenoid. The inferior dental nerve should be traced by cutting away the outer table of the body of the jaw with Hey's saw, and bone forceps. It can easily be made out ending in mental and dental branches, and with a little pains it may be seen to give off a branch to each tooth fang. Triang-les of ttie necl£.—The body still lying upon its back, the shoulders and neck should be raised to a convenient height with a block, and the head pulled very strongly over to the opposite side by hooks. These latter may be conveniently fastened through the septum of the nose and into the table. The face and pterygoid region must be covered with a damp cloth, and kept for frequent examination. The student will find that if he shows the different structures to his friends he will soon become familiar with them himself. The surface markings of the neck should first be made out. The lower jaw and mastoid process require no further mention. The student should make his finger familiar with the outline of the sternum, clavicle, and acromion process. The anterior edge of the trapezius should be traced, and the sterno-mastoid seen. To make this muscle

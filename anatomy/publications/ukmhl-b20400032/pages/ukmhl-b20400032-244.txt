The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. 230 The meningeal arteries in the anterior fossa are very small, and may be seen close to the cribriform plate. They come from the ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic. The most anterior one serves as a guide to the nasal nerve, which at this point crosses the cribriform plate, to disappear down the slit (nasal) by the side of the crista galli. The dura mater should be removed by transverse cuts in order to display this nerve, of which only about an eighth of an inch can be seen. The most important artery in the middle fossa is the middle meningeal. In cleaning it care should be taken not to remove its accompanying veins. The branch which it sends forward to the orbit is easily seen, and another may be made out running back- wards and outwards to enter the petrous bone through the hiatus Fallopii. If another delicate artery is seen accompanying the petrosal branch of the middle meningeal it is a branch of the Vidian, which enters the ear by the same apertures. These arterial twigs, which are often small and uninjected, serve as guides to the great petrosal nerve, which may now be very carefully traced from the hiatus Fallopii, until it passes beneath the gasserian ganglion. Great care must be taken not to mistake fine bundles of dura mater for this nerve. Sometimes the small and external petrosal nerves can be found a little external to the greater, but much depends upon the way in which they happen to leave the petrous bone. (Vide page 331.) In the posterior fossa of the skull some small meningeal arteries 'may be seen entering at the jugular foramen and anterior condyloid foramena, but no special directions are required for their dis- section. The meningeal branch of the vertebral arteries is of larger size and easily distinguished. The nerves in the posterior fossa of the skull

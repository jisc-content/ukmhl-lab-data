The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. 278 over the atlas, lying at first between the occipito- atloid articulation and the vertebral artery, internal to the artery ; afterwards it emerges in front between the rectus capitis lateralis and the rectus capitis anticus minor, and external to the rectus capitis anticus major. After emerging, this anterior branch of the suboccipital nerve turnb downwards over the front of the lateral mass of the atlas, to communicate, or form a loop, with the anterior division of the second cervical nerve. Before endeavouring to dissect either the first or the second cervical nerve the student should get an atlas and a skull, and carefully marking in the loop formed by the first and second cervical nerves, he will then see how very near the loop is to the anterior condyloid and posterior lacerated foramena, and the carotid canal. The second cervical nerve may also have been seen, if the suboccipital triangle has been dissected ; the great posterior branch will have been dissected, and is called the great occipital nerve. The second cervical nerve difiers from those below in this, that it does not emerge from the spinal canal at the intervertebral foramen, but between the posterior arch of the atlas and lamina of the axis. The anterior division of the second winds outside the vertebral artery to the front; the anterior divisions of other cervical nerves wind round to the front in a similar manner; and each, when it has passed the vertebral artery, divides into a branch which ascends in front of the transverse process to the nerve above, and one which descends in front of the transverse process to the nerve below. These loops constitute the deep cervical plexus. The upper end of the sterno-mastoid having been pulled upwards and backwards, no difficulty will be experienced in making out the second, third, and fourth, and in tracing the communicantes noni and phrenic to them.

Chap. XI.] 3^9 The Ear, is not easily seen. The next step is to remove tlie upper and front part of the auditory process, and a portion of the roof of the external auditory canal, great care being taken not to injure the bone to which the tympanic membrane is attached. Any remains of the cartilage of the pinna and the integuments of the external meatus being cut away, the length and shape of the external ear and the constriction which it pre- sents about its middle, may be examined. The con- striction will be found to be due to an elevation of its floor. Next, the outer surface of the tympanic mem- brane is seen, with the handle of the malleus running down between its layers. The processus brevis of the malleus protrudes into the external ear at the upper part of the membrane, but covered by its outer layer. The biconcave shape and very oblique position of the membrane should be remarked. The middle ear is now to be opened both above and in front. Upon the upper border of the petrous bone, and about half an inch from the squamous portion of the temporal bone, there is an elevation due to the prominence of the superior semicircular canal. As the semicircular canal is, roughly speaking, above the vestibule, its prominence serves to indicate the position of that cavity. It has already been ascertained upon the dried sec- tions that the tympanum lies external to the vestibule, and that it extends some distance farther forward. To remove the roof of the tympanum, the sharp point of the bone forceps should be forced into the bone about one half to three-quarters of an inch in front of the prominence of the semicircular canal. In doing this, great care must be taken lest the forceps slip and injure the contents of the tympanum. If the student begins by drilling a hole, such an accident is less likely to occur. When once a start has been made, the roof of the tympanum may be taken away bit by bit, until the mastoid cells are exposed behind and the Eustachian

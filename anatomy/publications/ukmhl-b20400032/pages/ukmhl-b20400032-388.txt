The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. xvi. 374 upwards and outwards to the styloid process of the lii3ula, and onwards to the commencement of the first incision at the outer tuberosity of the femur. Remove the skin thus marked out. There will be exposed in the subcutaneous tissue the small sciatic nerve, posterior saphenous vein, and perhaps also some small branches from the external and internal popliteal nerves, and likewise from the internal cutaneous and saphenous nerves; cutaneous veins from internal saphenous and the main trunk, and cutaneous arteries from the popliteal or articular branches ; some lymphatics, and a lymphatic gland. The superficial fascia, with all these structures, must be removed. The relative positions of these structures should be mentioned in the answer. The deep fascia would then be exposed, and must be removed over the exact area of the incision. The gastrocnemius and plantaris, with the ham- strings, would then be exposed and cleaned; the nerves and arteries to the gastrocnemius and plantaris are seen, as also are the popliteal artery, vein, and internal popliteal nerve in the popliteal space ; the corresponding veins will be also visible. The communicantes peronei and poplitei would be seen. If the gastrocnemius and plantaris, with their arterial and nerve supply, be now removed at the edges of the pit which the student is making, the popliteus will be exposed, with more of the popliteal artery, vein, and external and internal popliteal nerves crossing over it. The biceps tendon, and the long and short external lateral ligaments, and capsular ligament^ should then be divided at the outer side * Students often ask whether they are supposed to remove the structures, which must be cut through in answering a dissection question, or reflect tliem. It is quite immaterial which they do, but it is perhax^s easier to adopt the former pLan.

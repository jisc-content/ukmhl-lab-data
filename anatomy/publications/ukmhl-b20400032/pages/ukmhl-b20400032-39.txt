Chap. III.] Dissection of the Arm. 25 be dissected downwards in a thin layer, and, after tlie axillary fascia has been removed, the cutaneous nerves must be searched for amongst the mass of fat which fills the space. Before attempting to dissect the cutaneous nerves an idea of their course and direction is essential. They come from the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves. Each of the intercostal nerves, except the first, which is very small, gives oif in the middle of its course (i.e.^ almost in the axillary line) a lateral cutaneous branch. As soon as these nerves emerge from the intercostal spaces, they divide into a branch which runs forward and a branch which runs backwards. Some of the anterior branches have been seen already running over the border of the pectoralis major. The posterior branches run back- wards over the latissimus dorsi. The upper two posterior branches, however, instead of running backwards over the latissimus dorsi, run down the inner side of the arm, and are called intercosto- humeral nerves. These nerves, coming out of the intercostal spaces, run outwards across the axilla, embedded in its fat. The anterior branches of the lateral cutaneous nerves have to be found, and, as the fat of the axilla is removed, should be traced to the origins. The posterior branches may afterwards be traced as far as the edge of the latissimus dorsi. The intercosto-humeral nerves lie rather high in the axilla, at the level of the second and third intercostal spaces. As they run transversely, they should be looked for by incisions made in that direction. When traced to the arm, they are usually found communi- cating with the small internal cutaneous branches of the inner cord of the brachial plexus. The only cutaneous artery found in the axilla is a long un- named branch of the axillary, which runs down the centre of the space. Before completely tracing the nerves the student should endeavour to obtain some

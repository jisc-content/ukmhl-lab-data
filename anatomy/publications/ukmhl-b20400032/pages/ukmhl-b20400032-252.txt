238 The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. ix. optic nerve to the inner angle of the orbit. Tlie ophthalmic artery and its branches should be dissected. No special directions are required to enable the student to do this. It can only be followed as far as the inner angle of the orbit at present, but its terminal branches, frontal and nasal, will be seen when the face is dissected. The lachrymal nerve and ai'tery are to be followed into the lachrymal gland, which may now be cleaned. With care, the nerve and artery may be seen to pass beyond the gland into the upper eye- lid. The student^ having made himself quite familiar with all the structures he has found in the orbit, may now divide the levator palpebrse, superior rectus, and optic nerve, and lift the globe upwards and forwards in order to see more completely the inferior division of the third nerve and the inferior oblique muscle. The last thing which remains to be done is to look on the outer wall of the orbit, close to the bone, for a small branch of the superior maxillary nerve, the temporo-malar, which enters the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure. There is no particular guide to this nerve, but it may usually be seen lying on the malar bone, and when it has been found a communication between it and the lachrymal may be seen. The orbit having been completed, the block be- neath the head should be lowered, and the dissection of the ocular appendages and muscles of the face begun. l>isgectioi& of the ocular appenclag^eis and naiflscles of tiie face.â€”In order to consult the convenience of those who are dissecting the arm, it is the custom in many dissecting-rooms to pass on to the dissection of the posterior triangle of the neck immediately after the brain has been removed, the orbit and face being completed afterwards. At present the appendages of the face will be gone on

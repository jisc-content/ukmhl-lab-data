Spinal Cord. 369 Chap. XV.] lower end of the cord followed down until it becomes exceedingly thin and tapering, and continuous with a very delicate white fibre, called the filum terminale. The filum terminale lies amongst the fibres of the Cauda equina, from which it may be distinguished by its whiter colour. It may be traced as far as the middle of the sacrum, but is easily broken. In the dorsal and cervical regions, if the nerve roots be separated and the cord itself drawn towards the opposite side, some (twenty-five) triangular pro- cesses of pia mater (ligamenta dentata) can be seen (Fig. 47). They are attached by their base to the cord, and after passing across the subarachnoid space, their apices pierce the arachnoid, to be attached to the dura mater. Besides the ligamenta dentata, the spinal portion of the spinal accessory nerve runs upwards between the anterior and posterior roots of the upper five or six cervical nerves. The dissection should now be continued, in order to see the ganglia upon the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. It is quite sufficient to dissect one or two. The bone (articular process) should be cut away, until the intervertebral foramen is exposed from behind. The nerve roots may then be traced from the cord, the dura mater being divided to expose their exit. The ganglia are situated in the posterior root, and the anterior root may be seen joining the nerve trunk beyond it. If well injected, the small arteries previously mentioned may be seen entering the canal with the nerve trunks. They are especially well marked in the lumbar and dorsal regions. The roots of the spinal nerves may be divided within the canal, in order to remove the cord, and see its anterior surface and the anterior spinal artery running down it. Sections may afterwards be made transversely through the cord, in order to see the grey matter in the interior. Unless the cord be fresh, Y

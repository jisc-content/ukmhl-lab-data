33^ The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. xiii. handle of the knife may be gently introduced beneath the retina to detach it from the deeply pigmented choroid beneath it. The pigmentary layer of the choroid really belongs to the retina, as developmental considerations show. {Bee Klein's Elements of Histology," p. 315.) The retina is attached only at the yellow spot, and around the entrance to the optic nerve, but this attachment cannot be seen in the dissecting-room. If the handle of the knife be now introduced between the choroid and sclerotic a number of small white nerves may be seen piercing the sclerotic, and running forwards upon its inner surface. They lie in a certain amount of greyish pigment (lamina fusca), which remains upon the sclerotic when the choroid has been detached. These are the ciliary nerves, which were traced as far as the sclerotic when the orbit was dissected. The two long ciliary, which are of larger size than the others, run along the right and left sides of the sclerotic to reach the cornea. The dissection of the front of the globe may now be begun. It includes the Eetina and ora serrata. Iris. Vitreous humour and zone Ciliary nerves (terminations). of Zinn. Ciliary ligament. Crystalline lens. Cornea. Canal of Petit. The retina can easily be seen in the human eye extending as far forwards as the ciliary processes, where its edge is slightly irregular, and is called the ora serrata. This serrated edge does not exist in bullocks' eyes. The ciliary pro- cesses are folds or pleats of the choroid, and are situated all round the edge of the crystalline lens. They radiate from before backwards, and are about fifty in number (fifty to eighty). Both the ciliary processes and the ora serrata can be seen without

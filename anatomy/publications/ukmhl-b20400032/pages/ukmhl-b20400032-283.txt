Chap, ix.i Submaxillary Triangle. 269 belly should be cleaned.* The superior boundaries of the triangle are the lower border of the inferior maxilla, and a line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process. It will be remembered that this was the line which defined the lower margin of the parotid gland. In most cases the parotid extends into the posterior part of the submaxillary triangle. It is very convenient to divide the submaxillary triangle into an anterior and a posterior part. The stylo-maxillary ligament, which separates the sub- maxillary from the parotid gland, forms a natural boundary. The front part of the triangle con- tains the Hyo-glossiis. Mylo-hyoid. (?) Anterior belly of digastri- cus. Submaxillary gland (saliv- ary). Submaxillary glands (lymph- atic). Facial artery and its cervical branches. ( Submental. \ Submaxillary. 1 Ascending palatine. ( Tonsillar. Facial vein. Mylo-hyoid nerve and artery. The posterior part of the triangle may be said to contain the structures given in the list below; but the same remark applies to this space as was applied to the inferior and superior carotid triangles, that many of the things are not really contained in them, but lie just outside. It will be found convenient to dissect the structures in the posterior part of the triangle in the following order : (1) The external carotid. (2) Parts between the external and internal carotid, including the styloid process and things attached to it. (3) Structures beneath the styloid process. * Some authors, instead of giving the jaw, and bellies of the digastric muscles, as the boundaries of the submaxillary triangle, give the middle line of the neck as the froiit boundary, and iticlude the anterior belly of the digastricus in the floor.

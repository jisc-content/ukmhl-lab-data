Chap, v.i The External Oblique, 123 is called cremasteric. To trace the muscular fibres up to the pubes again, the scrotum must be lifted up; but the student must not be disappointed if he does not find them, as they are often very rudimentary. They are greatly increased in size when an old hydro- cele or scrotal hernia is present. The internal oblique must now be turned down like the external. The student will note that he is quite unable at the inner part nearest the symphysis pubis) to separate the internal oblique from the subjacent transversalis, because they are blended to form the conjoined tendon. The conjoined tendon is the lower end of the anterior sheath of the rectus, which is inserted into the crest of the pubes, and prolonged some distance outwards along the linea ilio-pectinea. The rectus, as has been already seen, has no posterior sheath in the lower third. Towards the crest of the ilium the internal oblique and trans- versalis are easily separated by a thin layer of fat or areolar tissue, which is rarely absent. But if any difficulty is experienced in separating them, the deep circumflex iliac artery, mentioned above, will serve as a guide. The transversalis will be next turned down, taking care to dissect off from it, and to leave behind, the thin fascia which lies on its under side (the fascia transver- salis), and which is continued, under the name of the infundibuliform fascia, over the cord down into the scrotum. It is so called from its funnel shape, which can be easily seen wdth care from the inside of the abdomen, but is not so easily recognised on the out- side. In order to demonstrate the fact that the infundi- buliform fascia passes down to form one of the constituents of the scrotum, the cremaster muscle and fascia must first be removed. The layers of the external oblique, internal oblique,

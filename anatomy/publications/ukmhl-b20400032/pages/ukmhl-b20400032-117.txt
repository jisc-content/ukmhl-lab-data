103 The Ankle-joint. Chap. IV.] that wliicli he can observe so well on his own body, that the knee-joint is capable of flexion and extension, and, to a limited extent, of rotation. All this he can demonstrate on the leg before him, by holding the femur firmly, and swinging the tibia and fibula. He will find out another fact by endeavouring to rotate the tibia and fibula on the femur, viz., that he can do it only when the knee is bent. This will be readily demonstrated on his own body. Again, though he can flex the leg upon the thigh, he cannot extend it beyond the points at which the femur and tibia are in the same straight line. When the leg is fully extended the posterior ligament, lateral ligaments, and crucial ligaments, will be found to be all tight, hence, it is they which prevent rotation in this position. The action of the lateral ligaments is best shown in Fig. 9, from which it will be seen that the more extended the leg is, the more the lateral liga- ment is on the stretch ; this is owing to the fact that the distance A B is greater than the distance A c. The articulations of the tibia and fibula above and below are almost fixed, and need but little dissec- tion to display the ligaments in front and behind them. The saiikle-joiiat.â€”Having removed all struc- tures from the ankle-joint and foot, except the tendons of the tibialis posticus, peroneus longus, and brevis, the ankle may be studied. The joints of the foot must be made as supple as possible by soaking them in water. The external and internal lateral ligaments must be carefully cleaned. There will be no difiiculty in finding them, starting at the tips of the malleoli, and stretching backwards, forwards, and downwards. The student should take care to trace the three fasciculi of the external lateral ligament.

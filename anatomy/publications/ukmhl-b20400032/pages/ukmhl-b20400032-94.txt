8o The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. iv. In between the metatarsal bones the dorsal interossei muscles are seen when the fascia which covers them is removed. They cannot be at present traced to their insertions. The dorsum of the foot having been learnt so far, must be covered up with its own skin, or with some guttapercha tissue, so as to keep it moist and avail- able for future inspection. l^isseetion of fottttocM a^nd back of thigfi. â€”Place the body on its face, and raise the pelvis some two feet from the table with blocks, so that the legs hang downwards. The legs should be crossed, so as to make the skin and underlying structure tense. Surface Markings. Crest of ilium. Coccyx. Posterior superior spine of Tuberosit}^ of ischium. ilium. Great trochanter of femur. Spines of sacral vertebrae. Fold of buttock. The crest of the ilium has already been felt from the front: there will be no difficulty, therefore, in finding it behind, and tracing it round as far as its termination in the posterior superior spine, of course with a bone at hand as well. In the middle line of the body the spines of the sacral vertebrae w'll be felfc, and just above the anus the coccyx, which can usually be felt to be movable. On either side of the anus, the two prominences of bone (ischial tuberosities) on which the body rests in the sitting position, will be very well seen, and more easily felt. Outside these again, and a little above them, quite at the outer side of the leg, the great trochanter of the femur must be felt. Stretch a piece of string from the anterior superior iliac spine in front, to the ischial tuberosity behind, it will be found to pass directly over the great trochanter. This is called

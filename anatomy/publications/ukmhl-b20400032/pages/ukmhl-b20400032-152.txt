138 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. v. divided scrotum at once proclaims its homology with the labia, and the small retracted penis assumes the appearance and position of the clitoris. Before commencing the dissection of the female perinseum, the student will have no difficulty in recognising the labia majora, or outer lips of fche vagina, and the labia minora, or inner lips. Just at the juncture of these, in front, is situated a small body, the clitoris, and immediately below it the orifice of the urethra. Into this a probe or catheter should be passed, so as to determine its direction. At each side of the vagina, and just internal to the labia minora, are the openings of the ducts of the glands of Bartholin. There is one duct on each side, and in a fresh body they can usually be found after a careful search, and a probe or bristle passed into them. The glands themselves are situated a little way up the wall of the vagina. Uniting the labia majora and minora of the two sides behind, the student should look for a transverse fold of mucous membrane, which is called the four- chette. It is of considerable importance in determining whether a woman has borne children, as it is usually ruptured at the birth of the first child. Stretching across the mouth of the vagina, im- mediately inside the labia minora, is the hymen. A ragged edge of mucous membrane is sometimes seen in this situation, after the hymen has disappeared. It has received the name of carunculce imjrtiformes. The skin incisions will correspond with those in the m.ale, except that the one near the middle line starts from the symphysis, and passes all round the vagina, as well as the rectum, both of which cavities must be well stuffed with tow. The ischio - rectal fossae must be dissected, and the nerves sought for in the same manner as in the male.

The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. vi. 214 looked for coming from the subclavian close to it. The phrenic nerve crosses the internal mammary at its origin, and may be used as a guide to the artery. All of these branches, vertebral, internal mam- mary, and thyroid axis, come from the subclavians in the hrst part of their course, which is internal to the scalenus anticus. The second part of the subclavian lies behind the scalenus anticus. Only one branch, the superior in- tercostal, is given olff at this point. This artery, after arising from the subclavian, lies in front of the neck of the first rib, along with the first dorsal nerve and the first dorsal ganglion of the sympatlietic.'* If the thorax be well tilted, so that the student can look upwards into the dome of the pleura, these structures can be seen without any dissection, but to expose them the pleura should be removed. The sympathetic may be traced down to where it has already been dissected, and the intercostal artery cleaned where it lies, in the first and second intercostal spaces. As it crosses the neck of the first rib it gives ofif a branch (profunda cervicis), which will be afterwards traced to the back of the neck. The first dorsal nerve should be dissected and cleaned as it passes upwards behind the subclavian artery, where it has been already seen. It gives off a most important and greatly-overlooked branch, fi.rst intercostal, as it lies upon the neck of the rib. This branch can be seen, before the pleura is removed, running between that membrane and the under surface of the first rib, which it grooves. It does not really become an intercostal nerve until it has almost got as far forward as the front of the intercostal space, where it pierces and supplies the intercostal muscles and becomes cutaneous. The in- nominate artery, as it lies in front of the trachea, * The last cervical and first dorsal ganglion are usually joined, and lie in front of the neck of the first rib.

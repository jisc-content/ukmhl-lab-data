204 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. vi. heart, before attempting to dissect the cardiac plex- uses ; but this plan so destroys the relations of the parts which the student needs always to bear in mind, that it is better to adopt the above-described plan, which, though harder to do, is far more effectual when once completed. The piiliiaonary plexuseis are so close at hand, lying in front and behind the roots of the lungs, that to display them the vagi require only to be traced on- wards from the cardiac plexuses, and carefully cleaned. Considerable care is requisite if they are to be well cleaned. They will be seen to surround the roots of the lungs, and to send branches to their substance, which follow the ramifications of the blood- vessels. The posterior plexuses of the two sides are so closely connected behind the roots of the lungs, that they form in reality but one plexus, and afford the best instance in the whole body of a complete communication between plexuses situated on different sides. Sympathetic branches from the thoracic ganglia can be readily traced to these plexuses by exerting a little tension on the plexuses themselves, when the course of the nerves will be rendered more clear. The cesophag-eal pSexMS.â€”After the vagi have broken up to form the pulmonary plexuses, they re-form into single trunks, which are situated on the back and front surfaces of the oesophagus, and, fol- lowing the above-mentioned rule, the right is situated behind. This plexus begins about an inch below the roots of the lungs, and is of considerable size, ex- tending almost as far as the diaphragm. By exerting a little tension upon it, some sympathetic nerves from the thoracic ganglia will be demonstrated to exist. On emerging from this plexus, the two vagi main- tain their position, and should be traced on to the oesophageal opening of the diaphragm.

Chap. I.] 7 Glossary. The term relations is often used in an ambiguous sense, and needs therefore a little more explanation. Structures are said to be in relation which touch one another; but oftentimes where a structure is over another, but not touching it, it is said to be in rela- tion with it. In the following pages the word relations will be used only of parts that are in actual contact, and the body will always be supposed to be standing up cmd facing the person who is describing it. We shall therefore speak of the parts which touch any structure, as being " in front," " behind," " on its inner side," and "outer side." The term "middle line " always means the middle line of the body ; and in the case of a limb, the terms " inner side " and " outer side" will be spoken of with strict reference to the middle line of the body, and not to that of the limb. In the case of a limb it is advisable, if possible, to avoid using the words inner and outer sides at all_, and speak of them rather as the radial and ulnar sides in the arm, or the tibial and fibular sides in the leg. Any other commonly used terms about which the student may be in doubt, he will find explained in the Glossary which follows. GLOSSAKY. Anastomosis (Gr. avaaroiucoo-is, an opening).

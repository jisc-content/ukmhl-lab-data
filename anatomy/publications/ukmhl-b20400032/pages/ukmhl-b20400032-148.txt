The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. v. 134 consisting of a deep and superficial portion, the deeper fasciculus being situated in between the layers of the triangular ligament. Bj scraping along the fibres of the transversus perinsei muscle, there will be found an artery and nerve of the same name, which can be readily traced back to the pudic ; a bit more of the superficial perineal artery and nerves will be exposed, and several other smaller nerves and arteries. The next thing to be done is to remove the accelerator urinse, which completely covers and hides the bulb of the urethra, and likewise the erector penis, which covers and hides the crus penis. The anterior layer of the triangular ligament, which was referred to before, will then be exposed. It is, on the whole, better not to attempt a deeper dissection of the perinaaum at this stage, otherwise it is impossible to obtain a good side view of the pelvis, and to understand clearly the relations of the pro- static and the membranous portions of the urethra. The continuity of the walls of the scrotum and abdomen has already* been made out in the dissec- tion of that part. It now only remains, therefore, to remove the remnant of the scrotum, and so make out the structure of the penis. To efiect this, the scrotum, with its skin and fascia, must be turned upwards. The testicles, which can be easily felt lying in their sacs (the tunica vaginalis), should be cleared, with their sac unopened, from the surrounding skin and fascia, and cut away all remains of the structure along each side of the ascending ramus of the pubes, and the under side of the penis. The two testicles, each in their own tunica vaginalis, will now be connected with the body by the spermatic * If the scrotum has not been dissected, the student must turn to page 122, and dissect its various layers before attempting their j-ernoval.

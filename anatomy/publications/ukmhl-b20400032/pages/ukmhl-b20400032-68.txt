The Dissector's Manual, [Chap. iv. 54 the back of the leg should be begun and continued until the body is turned on to its back again, when dissection of the front will be resumed. Upper tliird of tliag-Ii in front.â€”Before making any incisions, the principal surface-markings as far as the knee should be mastered. The student may examine the whole of these upon his own body. The crest of the ilium. The anterior superior spine of ilium. Great trochanter. The spine and crest of the puhes. Poupart's hgament. The patella and condyles of femur. The adductor tubercle situated just above the inner con- dyle. The line of the femoral artery. The tubercle of tibia and head of fibula. The student who knows his bones will hardly find any diihculty in identifying the above-named surface-markings. Forming a well-marked prominence at the upper and outer extremity of the leg, even in the fattest bodies, is the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and the bony ridge which can be traced backwards and outwards from this to the iliac crest. Just below the spine is another prominence of bone, the great trochanter of the femur, which will be readily felt, as it alters its position when the leg is moved. Just above the penis or vagina, as the case may be, is a bony mass, formed by the pubic bones. The place in the middle line where the two bones join is called the symphysis. About three-quarters of an inch outside the symphysis another prominence (the spine of the pubes) can be felt if the body is not very fat. Hunning from this point to the anterior superior spine of the ilium, a band can be felt (Poupart's ligament). The patella will readily be recognised, either on the student's own body or on the part before

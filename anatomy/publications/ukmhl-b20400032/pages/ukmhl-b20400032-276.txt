262 The Dissector's Manual. [Chap. ix. cutaneous twigs id ay be seen emerging from the platysma-myoides, already described, with the posterior triangle; but when the muscle has been reflected upwards and forwards from the posterior triangle, the following structures come into view : Deep cervical fascia. Suj^erficial (tranverse) cervi- External jugular vein. cal nerve. Anterior jugular veins. Cervico-facial nerve. Auriculo-parotidean nerves. Sternal branches of cervical plexus. The deep cervical fascia has been already described, but as the dissection progresses the student must remember to verify the description. The cervical branch of the facial nerve should be traced down from the trunk, and its communications with the superficial cervical nerve made out. This can easily be done if the body is a lean one. The branches of the superficial cervical plexus were found before emerging from the posterior border of the sterno- mastoid. If not already exposed, the superficialis colli or transversalis colli nerve will be found just at the place at which the external jugular vein leaves the posterior border of sterno-mastoid. The nerve, which is sometimes of small size, hooks round the vein, and may sometimes be seen to pierce it. The auriculo - parotidian nerve will be found running upwards with the external jugular vein. A small unnamed nerve will generally be found also running with the vein on the sterno-mastoid. The sternal branches of the cervical nerve run downwards over the sterno-mastoid, but are smaller and more difficult to find than those already mentioned, Nothing more need be said about the external jugular vein. The anterior jugulars will be seen in the anterior triangles, almost in the middle line. If there is only one vein, it usually occupies the middle line and may be of considerable size. Usually there are two, beginning

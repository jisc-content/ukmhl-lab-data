The origins of the external cutaneous branches of the musculo-spiral nerve and its branches to the supinator longus and extensor carpi radialis longior, should be made out, coming off where the nerve lies in contact with the muscles. The arterial anastomosis around the elbow-joint may next be dissected. There is always an abundant arterial anastomosis around joints, but nowhere so free as round the elbow. If the student flexes his own elbow very strongly, and, whilst doing so, keeps his finger upon his radial artery, he will find that when the joint is completely flexed the pulse stops. The anastomosis around the joint is so free, that if the flexion were continued the lower part of the arm would not cease to have a sufficient supply of blood. The anastomosis is carried on by arteries, which ascend and descend before and behind each condyle. There must therefore be four ascending and four descending arteries. Nearly the whole of this anastomosis will be seen to be linked together by an artery (anasto- motica magna), which rises from the brachial and runs round just above the condyles. Before endeavouring to make out any of the anastomosis, it will be found easier to complete the dissection of the front of the fore-arm in the following order: Muscles attached in inner I Eadial artery and nerve. condyle. Ulnar artery and nerve. Muscles attached to front of Median nerve and its artery, outer condyle. I Comes nervi mediani. When these have been accomplished, the super- ficial flexors should be replaced, and the dissection continued in the following order : Anastomosis around joint. Anterior interosseous artery- Deep flexors. and nerve. Common interosseous artery. Supinator brevis. Pronator quadratus.

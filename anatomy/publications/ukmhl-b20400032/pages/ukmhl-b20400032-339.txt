Chap.XII.] Nasal Cavities, 325 section the modiolus and lamina spiralis ossea may be seen, and possibly the scala media. A pocket magni- fying glass will be of aid in recognising the scala media. The student is advised to keep this preparation for frequent reference. However, if he wishes to see the inner wall of the tympanum and the tympanic plexus, it will have to be sacrificed. To expose the tympanic plexus, the incus should be removed. The floor and posterior wall of the tympanum should be sawn through, so as to leave the membrana tympani and malleus upon the external portion; the inner wall of the tympanum and stapes, together with the facial nerve and pyramid, should belong to the inner portion. The promontory may easily be re- cognised, and upon it the branches of Jacobson's nerve can be seen. Their presence will rather be indicated by the grooves they make on the bone than by the nerve branches themselves. These grooves may be seen leading towards the fenestra ovalis and rotunda, and others in the direction of the ganglion intumescentiaformis. The stapes has already been seen filling the fenestra ovalis. The fenestra rotundum, which is greatly concealed by the promontory, is not quite so easy to see; it is filled in by a membrane, the membrana tympani secundaria, which separates the cochlea from the tympanum. CHAPTER XII. DISSECTION OF THE NASAL CAVITIES, MECKEl's GAN- GLION, AND SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. The bones which surround the nasal cavities still remain intact. Before making any sections through them, the shape and size and boundaries of the

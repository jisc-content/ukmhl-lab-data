286 THIRD TUNIC. — RETINA. zonula ciliaris between its processes, and thus establishes a connection between the choroid and hyaloid membrane. The ciliary processes are covered by a thick layer of pigmentum nigrum, which is more abundant upon them and upon the anterior part of the choroid than upon the posterior. When the pigment is washed off, the processes are of a whitish colour. 3. The Third tunic {fig. 31.) of the eye is the retina, which is prolonged forwards to the lens by the zonula ciliaris. Dissection. — If after the preceding dissection the choroid mem- brane be carefully raised and removed, the eye being kept under water, the retina will be seen very distinctly. The Retina {fig. 31. l.,fig. 32. 8.) is composed of three layers : — External, or Jacob’s membrane, Middle, Nervous membrane, Internal, Vascular membrane. Jacob’s membrane is extremely thin, and is seen as a flocculent film when the eye is suspended in water. It is the supporting membrane to the nervous substance of the second layer. Dr. Jacob considers it a serous mem- brane. The Nervous membrane is the expansion of the optic * Fig. 31. The third tunic of the eye. No. 1.

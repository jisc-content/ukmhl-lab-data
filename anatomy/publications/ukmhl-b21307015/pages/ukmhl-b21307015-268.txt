238 ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. and derives its blood from the internal carotid and verte- bral arteries. Its Nerves are the minute filaments of the sympathetic, which accompany the branches of the arteries. The Arteries of the brain maintain a remarkable com- munication at its base, which is called the Circle of Willis. If the arachnoid membrane be removed, and the connec- tions of the pia mater slightly separated, these vessels may be distinctly seen and examined. At the fissure of Sylvius the internal carotid artery will be seen to divide into three branches : â€” Anterior cerebral, Middle cerebral, Posterior communicating. The Anterior cerebral artery passes forwards in the great longitudinal fissure between the two hemispheres of the brain ; then curves backwards along the corpus callo- sum, and inosculates with the posterior cerebral artery. It gives branches to the inner surface of the hemispheres. The two anterior cerebral arteries are connected soon after their origin by a short anastomosing trunk, the an- terior communicating. The Middle cerebral artery passes outwards along the fissure of Sylvius, and divides into several large branches, which supply the anterior and middle lobes. Near its origin it gives off the numerous small branches which enter the substantia perforata. The Posterior communicating artery, very variable in size, sometimes double, and sometimes altogether absent, passes backwards and inosculates with the posterior cere- bral, a branch of the basilar. Commencing at the posterior extremity of the base of the brain, the two Vertebral arteries will be seen con- verging to the inferior border of the pons Varolii, where they form the Basilar. The vertebrals are often unequal in size, one being much larger than the other. Their branches within the skull are, Anterior spinal, Posterior spinal, Posterior meningeal, Inferior cerebellar.

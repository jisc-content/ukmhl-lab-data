POSTERIOR REGION OF THE FORE-ARM. 104* The branches of the Musculo-spiral nerve may be thus arranged: — Upper arm Fore-arm { { Muscular, Spiral cutaneous. Radial, Posterior interosseous. If we make an analysis of the supply of nerves to the muscles of the upper extremity, from the various sources above described, we shall find them disposed according to the following arrangement: — Deltoid muscle — Circumflex nerve. Upper arm Fore-arm Hand ffront — External cutaneous. \ back — Musculo-spiral. Xfront — Median, ulnar, and radial. \ back — Radial and posterior interosseous. Xfront — Median and ulnar. \ back — Radial and ulnar. Posterior Region of the Fore-arm. No new dissection is required for this region: the integument already thrown back from the anterior region is now to be removed altogether, and with it the super- ficial fascia: in this proceeding the posterior ulnar vein may be seen throughout its course, taking its origin in- feriorly from the vein of the little finger, “ vena salva- tella.” On the radial side, the radial vein may be ob- served commencing by the veins on the back of the hand, and winding around the radial border of the fore- arm to the bend of the elbow. The posterior branches of the internal cutaneous nerve are distributed along the course of the posterior ulnar vein, and the external cuta- neous and spiral cutaneous, on the radial border of the fore-arm. At the lower third of the fore-arm, the radial nerve is seen piercing the fascia, to reach the back part of the hand ; and, just above the wrist, the dorsal branch of the ulnar emerges from the fascia to the same destination. On removing the deep fascia, the superficial layer of muscles is brought into view.

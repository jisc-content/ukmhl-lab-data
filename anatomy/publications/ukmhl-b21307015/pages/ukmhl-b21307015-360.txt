330 SPERMATIC CANAL. Dissection.—One side of the abdomen having been reserved for the study of hernia, the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle should now be carefully dissected and turned down. The abdominal pa- rietes, in the inguinal region, should in the next place be cut through, and the flap drawn forwards, so that the internal surface of the region may be examined. When the peritoneum is removed from this suf- face, it will be found adherent at a part corresponding with the en- trance of the spermatic cord into the spermatic canal. The vessels composing the cord will be seen converging to this point, the spermatic artery from over the psoas muscle, and the vas deferens from the side of the bladder. The epigastric artery will also be seen ascending obliquely to the sheath of the rectus. Beneath the peritoneum, and immediately investing the transversalis muscle, is the transversalis fascia (Jiff. 39. 2.), a dense layer of cellular fibrous membrane, continuous with Poupart’s ligament, 1., below, and on the inner side with the edge of the sheath of the rectus : above and upon the outer side it is gradually lost in the subserous cellular tissue. In this fascia, which is an important defence to the occurrence of hernia in the inguinal region, is situated the opening for the transmission of the spermatic cord, the internal abdominal ring, 3. The Internal abdominal ring (tfig. 39. 3.) is an ob- lique opening in the fascia transversalis, situated mid- way between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the spine of the pubis, and about half an inch above Poupart’s liga- ment. The border of the ring invests the spermatic cord with an infundibiliform sheath in its passage through it, and the hernial protru- sion taking the same course obtains necessarily the same sheath or covering. The Spermatic canal is the oblique space in the ab- * Fig. 39. The transversalis fascia, the abdominal muscles being removed.

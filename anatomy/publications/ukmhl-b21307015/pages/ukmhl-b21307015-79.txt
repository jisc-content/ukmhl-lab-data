ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY.—BRANCHES. 49 The relations to the veins are the same j the nerve lies to its outer side. The Branches of the anterior tibial artery are the fol- lowing : — Anterior tibial Recurrent, Muscular, External malleolar, Internal malleolar. The Recurrent branch passes upwards to the front of the knee-joint upon which it is distributed, anastomosing with the articular arteries. It pierces the origin of the tibialis anticus muscle. The Muscular branches supply the muscles of this region. The Malleolar arteries are distributed to the ankle joint; the external passing beneath the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius, and inosculating with the anterior peroneal artery ; the internal beneath the tendons of the extensor proprius pollicis and tibialis anticus, inosculates with branches of the posterior tibial artery. The Anterior tibial nerve (fig- 6. 13.) commences at the bifurcation of the peroneal upon the head of the fibula, and passes beneath the upper part of the extensor longus digitorum, to reach the outer side of the anterior tibial artery, just as that vessel has passed through the opening in the interosseous membrane. It descends with the artery, lying at first to its outer side, and then in front of it, and near the ankle becomes again placed to its outer side. It supplies the muscles of the anterior tibial region, and terminates in the dorsalis pedis nerve. Dorsal Region of the Foot. The deep fascia in this region is extremely thin, and can hardly be said to exist: the muscles on the dorsum of the foot are, Extensor brevis digitorum, 4 Dorsal interossei | bicipital | * abduckn’s The Extensor brevis digitorum muscle arises from a tubercle on the outer side of the os calcis, crosses the

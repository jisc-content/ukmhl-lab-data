MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX. 316 several muscles, under the names of transversi and obliqui. The three muscles of the epiglottis are the Thyro-epiglottideus, Aryteno-epiglottideus superior, Aryteno-epiglottideus inferior (Hilton’s muscle). The Thyro-epiglottideus appears to be formed by the upper fibres of the thyro-arytenoideus muscle : they spread out upon the external surface of the sacculus laryngis, on which they are lost; a few of the anterior fibres being continued onwards to the side of the epi- glottis. The Aryteno-epiglottideus superior consists of a few scattered fibres, which pass forwards in the fold of mucous membrane, forming the lateral boundary of the entrance into the larynx, from the apex of the arytenoid cartilage to the side of the epiglottis. The Aryteno-epiglottideus inferior. — This muscle was discovered by Mr. Hilton, and is very important in rela- tion to the sacculus laryngis, with which it is closely connected. It may be found by raising the mucous mem- brane immediately above the ventricle of the larynx. It arises by a narrow and fibrous origin from the arytenoid cartilage, just above the attachment of the chorda vocalis; and passing forwards, and a little upwards, expands over the upper half, or two thirds of the sacculus laryngis, and is inserted by a broad attachment into the side of the epiglottis. Actions. — The crico-thyroid and arytenoid muscles are contractors of the rima glottidis : the crico-aryte- noideus posticus and lateralis, and the thyro-arytenoideus, are dilators. The crico-thyroid muscles elongate, and thereby bring together the chordae vocales, by drawing the thyroid cartilage downwards and forwards; their posterior attach- ment at the arytenoid cartilages being fixed. The ary- tenoid muscle approximates the arytenoid cartilages, and consequently the chordae vocales, directly. The crico-tliyroidei postici being attached to the outer side of the base of the arytenoid cartilages, draw them

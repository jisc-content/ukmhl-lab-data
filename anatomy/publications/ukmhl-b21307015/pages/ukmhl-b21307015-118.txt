88 AXILLARY ARTERY BRANCHES. Branches. — The branches of the Axillary artery are seven in number : — Thoracico-acromialis, Superior thoracic, Inferior thoracic, Thoracico-axillaris, Subscapular, Circumflex anterior, Circumflex posterior. The thoracico-acromialis and superior thoracic, are found in the triangular space above the pectoralis minor. The inferior thoracic and thoracico-axillaris, below the pectoralis minor. And the three remaining branches below the lower border of the subscapularis. The Thoracico-acromialis {fig. 7.) is a short trunk that ascends to the space above the pectoralis minor muscle, and divides into three branches, — thoracic, 10., which is distributed to the pectoral muscles and mammary gland ; acromial, 12., passing outwards to the acromion; descend- ing, li., to the space between the deltoid and pectoralis major that lodges the cephalic vein. The Superior thoracic, 9. (short) runs along the upper border of the pectoralis minor, and is distributed to the jiectoral muscles and mammary gland. The Inferior thoracic, 13. (long), runs along the lower border of the pectoralis minor, and is distributed to the pectoral and serratus muscles, and mammary gland. The Thoracico-axillaris, 14., is a small branch distri- buted to the plexus of nerves and glands in the axilla. The Subscapular artery, the largest of the branches of the axillary, runs along the lower border of the sub- scapularis muscle, to the inferior angle of the scapula, where it inosculates with the posterior scapular, a branch of the subclavian. It supplies the muscles on the under surface, and inferior border of the scapula, and side of the chest. At about an inch and a half from the axillary, it gives off a large branch, the dorsalis scapula;, which passes backwards through the triangular space bounded by the teres minor, teres major, and scapular head of the triceps, and beneath the infra-spinatus to the dorsum of

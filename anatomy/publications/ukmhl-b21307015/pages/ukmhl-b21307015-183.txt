AURICULAR GROUP. MAXILLARY GROUP. 153 H 5 Before proceeding to examine the maxillary group, it would be desirable to dissect the three small muscles belonging to the external ear. For this purpose a square of integument should be removed from around it, and the muscles will then be exposed. 7. Auricular Group. Attollens aurem, Attrahens aurem, Retrahens aurem. The Attollens aurem (superior auris), the largest of the three, is a thin triangular plane of muscular fibres arising from the temporal fascia, and inserted into the upper part of the concha of the ear. The Attraliens aurem (anterior auris) arises from the temporal fascia immediately above the zygoma, and is inserted into the anterior part of the concha. The Retrahens aurem (posterior auris) arises by three or four muscular slips from the mastoid process. They are inserted into the posterior surface of the concha. 6. Maxillary Group. Masseter, Temporalis, Buccinator, Pterygoideus exterrius, Pterygoideus internus. The remaining group consists of the masticatory muscles. The first of these is the masseter : it has been already exposed by the dis- section which has been directed for the other muscles. The Masseter ([/.aao-do^ai, to chew,) muscle is composed of two planes of fibres, superficial and deep. The super- ficial layer arises from the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, and the lower border of the malar bone and zigoma, and passes backwards to be inserted into the ramus and angle of the inferior maxilla. The deep layer arises from the posterior part of the zigoma, and passes forwards to be inserted into the upper half of the ramus. 1 his muscle is tendinous and muscular in its structure. It is crossed by the duct of the parotid gland, by the transverse facial artery, and by several branches of the facial nerve.

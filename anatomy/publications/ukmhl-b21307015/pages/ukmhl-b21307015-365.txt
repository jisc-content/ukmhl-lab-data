335 REGIONS OF THE ABDOMEN. guinal glands, and those from the upper ascending to the mediastinal glands. The Nerves are the inferior in- tercostal and musculo-cutaneous branches of the lumbar plexus. The student should now lay open the abdomen by means of a crucial incision, and study its division into regions, the position of the viscera, and the perito- neum. The Cavity of the abdomen is bounded in front and at the sides by the lower ribs and abdominal mus- cles ; behind, by the vertebral co- lumn and abdominal muscles; above by the diaphragm ; and, below, by the pelvis. Regions. — If two transverse lines be carried around the body, the one parallel with the convexities of the ribs, the other with the highest points of the crests of the ilia, the abdomen will be divided into three zones. Again, if a perpendicular line be drawn at each side from the cartilage of the eighth rib to the middle of Poupart’s ligament, the three primary zones will each be subdivided into three compartments or regions, a middle and two lateral. The middle region of the upper zone being immediately over the small end of the stomach, is called Epigastric (£7r<—yaar-rif, over the stomach). The two lateral regions being under the cartilages of the ribs, are called Hypo- the testicle; the tunica vaginalis of the testicle forming the sac of the hernia. Nos. 1. 1. The tunica vaginalis testis, continuous superiorly with the peritoneum, of which it is a part. 2. The testicle. 3. The sper- matic cord. * Fig. 42.

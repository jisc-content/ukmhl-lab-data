298 OSSICULA AUDITUS. surface to the handle of the malleus. It is depressed towards the centre, and is concave towards the meatus, and convex towards the tympanum. It is composed of three layers, an external cuticular, middle fibrous and mus- cular, and internal mucous, derived from the mucous lining of the tympanum. The tympanum contains four small bones, ossicula anditus, viz. the Malleus, Incus, Orbiculare, Stapes. The Malleus (hammer) consists of a head, neck, handle (manubrium), and two processes, long (processus gracilis) and short (processus brevis). It is attached by the manu- brium to the membrana tympani, the extremity of the handle extending to the centre of that membrane. Its connection is effected by being inserted between the mucous lining and the fibrous and muscular layer. Its long process descends to the fissura Glaseri *, and gives attachment to the laxator tympani muscle. Into the short process is inserted the tendon of the tensor tym- pani, and the head of the bone articulates with the incus. The Incus (anvil) is named from an imagined resem- blance to an anvil. It has also been likened to a bicuspid tooth, having one root longer, and widely separated from the other. It consists of two processes, which join each other nearly at right angles, and at their junction form a flattened body, which articulates with the head of the malleus. The short process is free ; the long process descends nearly parallel with the handle of the malleus, and curves inwards, near to its termination, to articulate with the os orbiculare. The Os orbiculare is a small spherical bone, distinct in the foetus, but anchylosed to the long process of the incus in the adult, and appearing only as a process of that bone. It articulates with the head of the stapes. The Stapes is shaped like a stirrup, to which it bears a * John Henry Glaser.

HEPATIC ARTERY. — SPLENIC ARTERY. 351 ture to the pylorus, where it inosculates with the pyloric branch of the hepatic. It is distributed to the lower end of the oesophagus, and the lesser curve of the stomach. The Hepatic artery curves forwards and ascends along the right border of the lesser omentum to the liver, where it divides into two branches (right and left) which enter the transverse fissure, and are distributed to the right and left lobes. The branches of the hepatic artery are the Pyloric. y. j , . f Gastro-epiploica dextra, Gastro-duodenahs | Pancrea£c£.duodenaUs. Cystic. The Pyloric branch is distributed to the pylorus and lesser curve of the stomach, and inosculates with the gastric. The Gastro-duodenalis descends behind the pylorus, and divides into two branches, the gastro-epiploica dextra and pancreatico-duodenalis. The gastro-epiploica dextra runs along the great curve of the stomach, and inoscu- lates at about its middle with the gastro-epiploica sinistra, a branch of the splenic artery. It supplies the great curve of the stomach, and the great omentum, hence the derivation of its name. The pancreatico-duodenalis curves along the fixed border of the duodenum, and is distributed to it and to the head of the pancreas : it anastomoses with the first jejunal branch of the superior mesenteric artery. The Cystic is a small branch distributed between the coats of the gall bladder. The Splenic artery passes outwards along the upper border of the pancreas to the spleen, where it divides into five or six large branches, which are distributed to that organ. It usually makes several serpentine bends in its course, and sometimes a complete circular curve upon itself. Its branches are, — Pancreaticae parvae, Pancreatica magna, Vasa brevia, Gastro-epiploica sinistra. The Pancreaticce par vex are small nutrient branches

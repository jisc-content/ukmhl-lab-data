GLUTEAL REGION.— MUSCLES. £2 The muscles of the gluteal region are, Gluteus maximus, medius, minimus, Pyriformis, Gemellus superior, Obturator internus, Gemellus inferior, Obturator externus, Quadratus femoris. The Gluteus maximus (yXovro;, nates) is the thick, fleshy mass of muscle, of a quadrangular shape, which forms the convexity of the nates. In structure, it is ex- tremely coarse, being made up of large fibres, which are collected into fasciculi, and these again into distinct mus- cular masses, separated by deep cellular furrows. It arises from the posterior fifth of the crest of the ilium, from the border of the sacrum and coccyx, and from the great sacro-ischiatic ligament. It passes obliquely out- wards and downwards, to be inserted into the rough line leading from the trochanter major to the linea aspera, and is continuous by means of its tendon with the fascia lata, covering the outer side of the thigh. After this muscle has been sufficiently studied, it must be turned down from its origin. Its dissection, however, from the parts beneath demands considerable care, as a number of arteries and nerves are situated immediately below it. The Gluteus medius is placed in front rather than be- neath the gluteus maximus, and is covered in by a pro- cess of the deep fascia, which is very thick and dense. It arises from the outer lip of the crest of the ilium for four fifths of its length, from the surface of bone between that border, and the superior curved line on the dorsum ilii, and from the dense fascia above mentioned. Its fibres converge to the upper part of the trochanter major, into which its tendon is inserted. This muscle should now be removed from its origin and turned down, so as to expose the next which is situated beneath it. The Gluteus minimus [Jig. 4. 1.) is a pretty, radiated muscle, arising from the surface of the dorsum ilii, be-

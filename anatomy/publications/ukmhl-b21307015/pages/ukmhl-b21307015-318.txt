288 HUMOURS OF THE EYE. of the zonula will then be seen to be drawn out from between the folds of the ciliary processes. The Humours of the eye are each provided with its proper membrane. The Aqueous humour is situated in the anterior and pos- terior chambers of the eye. The Anterior chamber {Jig. 32. 12.) is the space inter- vening between the cornea in front, and the iris and pupil behind. The Posterior chamber, smaller than the anterior, is the narrow space bounded by the posterior surface of the * Fig. 32. A longitudinal section of the globe of the eye. No. 1. The sclerotic, thicker behind than in front. 2. The lamina cribrosa; the thin layer of the sclerotic, which is pierced with holes for the passage of the nervous substance of the optic nerve. 3. The cornea, which is seen to be inserted into the border of the sclerotic coat. 4. The choroid membrane (the dark layer). 5. The ciliary ligament. 6. The iris. * The pupil. 7. The ciliary pro- cesses. 8. The retina (the white layer). 9. The dotted line repre- sents the zonula ciliaris, which is continued from the anterior border of the retina to the capsule of the lens. 10. The innermost line is the hyaloid membrane, which may be followed behind the lens. 11. The canal of Petit. 12. The anterior chamber of the eye. The narrow space between the iris and the ciliary processes and lens is the pos- terior chamber. 13. The lens inclosed in its capsule. 14.

A minute artery, a branch of the arteria centralis retince, which traverses the centre of the vitreous humour to reach the capsule of the lens.

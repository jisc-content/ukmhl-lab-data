163 MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE. larynx. The genio-hyo-glossus is, moreover, a muscle of the tongue ; its action upon that organ shall be considered with the next group. Fourth Group. — Muscles of the Tongue. Genio-hyo-glossus, Hyo-glossus, Lingualis, Stylo-glossus, Palato-glossus. These are already exposed by the preparation we have just made ; there remains, therefore, only to dissect and examine them. The Genio-hyo-glossus, the first of these muscles, has been described with the last group. The Hyo-glossus is a square-shaped plane of muscle, arising from the whole length of the great cornu of the os hyoides, and inserted into the side of the tongue. This muscle is remarkable from being crossed by two large nerves, the gustatory and lingual, and by the duct (Wharton’s) of the submaxillary gland. See fig. 15. The lingual artery and glosso-pharyngeal nerve pass behind it. The Lingualis.— The fibres of this muscle may be seen towards the apex of the tongue, issuing from the space between the hyo-glossus and genio-l^o-glossus. It is better examined, however, by removing the preceding muscle. It consists of a small fasciculus of fibres, running longitudinally from the base, where it is attached to the os hyoides to the apex of the tongue. The Stylo-glossus arises from the apex of the styloid process, and from the stylo-maxillary ligament, and is inserted into the side of the tongue, nearly as far as the tip, intermingling its fibres with those of the hyo-glossus. Ihe Palato-glossus passes between the soft palate, and the side of the base of the tongue, forming a projection of the mucous membrane, which is called the anterior pillar of the soft palate. Actions.— Ihe genio-hyo-glossus muscle effects se- veral movements of the tongue, as might be expected from its extent. When the tongue is steadied and pointed by the other muscles, the posterior fibres of the

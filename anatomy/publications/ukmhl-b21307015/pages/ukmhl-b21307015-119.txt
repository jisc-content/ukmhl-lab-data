BRACHIAL ARTERY. RELATIONS. 89 the scapula, where it is distributed, inosculating with the supra-scapular and posterior scapular arteries. The Circumflex arteries wind around the neck of the humerus. The anterior, very small, passes beneath the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps, and sends a branch upwards along the bicipital groove to supply the shoulder-joint. The Posterior circumflex, of larger size, passes back- wards through the quadrangular space bounded by the teres minor and major, the scapular head of the triceps and the humerus, and is distributed to the deltoid muscle and joint: sometimes this artery is a branch of the superior profunda of the brachial. It then ascends be- hind the tendon of the teres major, and is distributed to the deltoid without passing through the quadrangular space. Brachial Artery. The Brachial artery runs down the inner side of the arm, from the lower border of the latissimus dorsi to the bend of the elbow. Relations.â€” In its course downwards, it rests upon the coraco-brachialis muscle, internal head of the triceps, and brachialis anticus. To its outer side are the coraco- brachialis and biceps muscles, and in front it has the basilic vein, and is crossed by the median nerve. Its relations, within its sheath, are the vense comites.

210 NERVES OF THE ORBIT. give the pupil that slight degree of eversion which enables it to receive the largest field of view. The opposite orbit should now be opened in the way already directed, with a view to study the distribution of the nerves and vessels. Nerves of the Orbit. The student should remove with a chisel as much of the outer wall of the orbit as possible, and break away the anterior clinoid process. Then let him remove the thin layer of dura mater that forms the outer boundary of the cavernous sinus. He will thus expose the four nerves passing by the side of the “ sella turcica ” to enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure. These should be separately and carefully traced through their course : they are the Third or motor oculi (fig. 21. 3.), Fourth or patheticus, 4., Ophthalmic or first division of the fifth, 13., Sixth or abducens, 6. They are placed in the above order from above down- wards, at their entrance into the cavernous sinus ; but the ophthalmic nerve soon divides into its three branches, frontal, lachrymal, and nasal, and the relative situation of the others is also changed with regard to each other. At the sphenoidal fissure, the six nerves are disposed in two sets, a superior consisting of Fourth (fig. *2,1. 4.), Frontal, 16., Lachrymal, 17., which enter the orbit above the origin of the levator palpebrae muscle ; and an inferior set, the Nasal (fig. 21. is.), Third, 3., Sixth, 6., which enter the orbit between the two heads of the external rectus muscle. While passing by the side of the sella turcica, the third (fig. 20. 5.), fourth, 6., and ophthal- * Fig. 20. A transverse section of the cavernous sinus of the right side. No. 1.

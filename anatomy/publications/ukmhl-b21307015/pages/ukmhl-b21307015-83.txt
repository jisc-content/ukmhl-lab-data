53 FIBULAR REGION NERVES. D 3 There is no artery in this region; but if the peroneus longus be carefully turned down from its origin, the peroneal nerve and its branches will be exposed. The Peroneal nerve {Jig .6. 8.) descends from the division of the great ischiatic nerve, along the tendon of the biceps, to the head of the fibula, where it pierces the origin of the peroneus longus muscle. At this point it divides into two branches, anterior tibial, 13., and musculo-cutaneous, 14. The Anterior tibial nerve, 13. passes through the upper part of the extensor longus digi- torum muscle, and accompanies the anterior tibial artery, lying at first to the outer side and then resting upon that vessel. Upon the dorsum of the foot it lies by the side of the dorsalis pedis artery, and is distributed to the adjoining sides of the great and second toes, after having supplied the muscles on the dorsum of the foot. The Musculo-cutaneous nerve, 14. passes for a short distance between the peroneus longus and extensor longus digitorum, both of which muscles it sup- plies ; hence its title “ musculo.” At the lower third of the leg it * Fig. 6.

271 COLUMNS. On the posterior surface another fissure (jig. 28. 11.) exists, which is so narrow as to be hardly perceptible without careful examination. This is the sulcus longitu- dinalis postei'ior. It extends much more deeply into the cord than the anterior sulcus, and terminates in the grey substance of the interior. These two fissures divide the medulla spinalis into two lateral cords, which are con- nected to each other only by the white layer, 9., which forms the bottom of the anterior longitudinal sulcus. On either side of the sulcus longitudinalis posterior is a slight line, which bounds on either side the posterior median columns {jig* 28. 15.). These are most apparent at the upper part of the cord, near to the fourth ventricle, where they are separated by the point of the calamus scriptorius. Two other lines are observed on the medulla, the an- terior and posterior lateral sulci, corresponding with the attachment of the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves. The Anterior lateral sulcus is a mere line, marked only by the attachment of the filaments of the anterior roots. The Postei'ior lateral sulcus is more evident ; and is formed by a narrow greyish fasciculus derived from the grey substance of the interior. These sulci divide the medulla into four fasciculi or cords, viz Anterior columns, Lateral columns, Posterior columns, Median posterior columns. The Anterior {jig. 28. 12. 12.) are the motor columns, missure, connecting the Uvo lateral halves of the cord. 10 The grey commissure connecting the two semilunar processes of grey substance. 11.

178 EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. pharyngeus and stylo-glossus muscles, glosso-pharyngeal nerve, 20., and part of the parotid gland. Its relations may be thus arranged : — In Front. Platysma. Digastricus. Stylo-hyoid. Lingual nerve. Facial nerve. Parotid gland. External Carotid Artery. jBehind. Stylo-pharyngeus. Stylo-glossus. Glosso-pharyngeal nerve. Parotid gland. The External carotid artery is intended for the supply of the organs in the neck and the external part of the head. If we reflect upon what these organs and parts should be, we shall find, that taking them in succession, from below upwards/they are, in front—1st. The thyroid gland and larynx. 2d. The tongue. 3d. The surface of the face. Behind—4th. The mastoid muscle. 5th. The external ear. 6th. The occiput. And above—7th. The pharynx. 8th. The side of the face. 9th. The temple and side of the head; and 10th. The deep parts in the face. These are so many arterial regions on the exterior of the head, and upper part of the neck : they are ten in number, and a branch of the external carotid is destined to the supply of each. The branches, therefore, are, — Anterior. Posterior. ]. Superior thyroid. 4. Mastoid. 2. Lingual. 5. Posterior auricular. 3. Facial. 6. Occipital. Superior. 7. Ascending pharyngeal. 8.

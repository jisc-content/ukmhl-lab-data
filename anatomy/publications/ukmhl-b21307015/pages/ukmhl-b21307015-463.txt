DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKELETON. 433 During the ninth and tenth iveeh, it commences in the condyles and basilar process of the occipital bone, in the body of the sphenoid, in the upper sacral vertebrae, and in the external auditory process of the temporal bone. During the eleventh and twelfth iveeks it commences in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, in the ischium, and in the internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid. At about the middle of the fourth month, in the ossicula auditus. During the fifth month, in the pubis, calcaneum, last phalanges of the toes, ethmoid, and sternum. At birth, the first vertebra of the coccyx, the ante- rior arch of the atlas, and the condyloid epiphysis of the femur. At one year after birth, the coracoid process of the scapula, the os magnum, os unciforme, and internal cu- neiform bone. At three years, in the patella, and cuneiform bone of tthe carpus. At four years, in the external and middle cuneiform Ibone. At five years, in the scaphoid of the tarsus, in the t trapezium and os lunare. At eight years, in the scaphoid of the carpus ; at nine tears, in the trapezoides ; and at about the twelfth year, in the pisiform bone. The ossicula auditus are the only bones completely ormed at birth. Vertebrae. — Each vertebra is developed from three irimitive centres — two lateral, for the arches; and one nedian, for the body: the former are the first deposited. To these are added five additional centres, which appear fterwards ; they are, one for each transverse process; ne for the spinous process; and one for the upper and nder surface of the body. The ossification of the arches commences from the pper part of the spinal column, and proceeds gradually ownwards; hence the imperfect development of the •ches occurs in the lumbar region, as in spina bifida, hat of the bodies commences in the middle of the dorsal gion, and spreads upwards and downwards as from a ?ntre, u

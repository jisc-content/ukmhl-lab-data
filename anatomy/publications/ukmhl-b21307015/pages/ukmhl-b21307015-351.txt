ABDOMEN. i>\ a The dissection of the abdomen is to be commenced by making three incisions : â€” The first, vertical, in the middle line, from over the lower part of the sternum to the pubes ; the second, oblique, from the umbilicus, upwards and outwards, to the outer side of the chest, as high as the fifth or sixth rib ; and the third, oblique, from the um- bilicus, downwards and outwards, to the middle of the crest of the ilium. The three flaps included by these incisions should then be dissected back in the direction of the fibres of the external oblique muscle, beginning at the angle of each. In the two upper flaps, the integu- ment and superficial fascia should be dissected off toge- ther, so as to show the muscle at once. The integument alone should be dissected from the lower flap, leaving the superficial fascia. Between the two layers of the super- ficial fascia, at the lower part of the abdomen, is the superficial epigastric artery and vein ; and, near the crest of the ilium, some branches of the superficial circumflex ilii artery and vein. When these have been examined, the superficial fascia may be removed from the lower part of the aponeurosis of the muscle. In turning back the flaps, several superficial nerves will be cut across ; these are cutaneous branches of the lower intercostal and' lumbar nerves. If the flaps be in the way, they may be removed altogether. One side of the abdomen should be dissected exclusively for the muscles ; the other should be reserved for studying the relations of hernia. The Muscles of the abdomen are the External oblique, descendens, Internal oblique, ascendens, Cremaster, Transversalis, Rectus, Pyramidalis, Quadratus lumborum.

7 CHAPTER I. THE LOWElt EXTREMITY. Before commencing the dissection of the lower ex- tremity, the student will carefully l-eflect upon the objects of his proposed dissection, and particularly upon the prac- tical application of the information which he is seeking to acquire. The lower extremity comprises all that portion of the body which forms the lower limb, and is bounded above by the external surface of the pelvis. It consists of a thigh, leg, and foot — of the hip, knee, ankle, tarsal, metatarsal, and digital joints — of a complicated appa- ratus of muscles — of the femoral, popliteal, tibial, pedal, and plantar arteries — of veins, lymphatics, nerves, bones, and ligaments. Now all these structures are liable to injury; and the surgeon, upon such an occurrence, is called upon to remedy the accident — to apply the knowledge that he shall have gained, through tue aid of his eyes and hands, in the dissecting room. Suppose the accident be one involving deep and important parts without affecting the surface, or exposing to the eyes the structure which may be injured : in such a case the surgeon has recourse to the comparative form and position of the adjoining limb; but circumstances may render this comparison unavailing; and he is then obliged to recal the observations he may chance to have made during his anatomical studies. De- pend upon it, that a sound knowledge of the relations of the different portions of the limbs will ever be found of the highest possible value to the practitioner who is sud- denly called to the aid of a wounded fellow-creature. Indeed, such a knowledge should be considered as the leading characteristic of the accomplished surgeon. Starting with reflections such as these, the student will perceive that other observations are necessary to him in addition to those which arise out of the mere dissection b 4 I

The urachus, proceeding from the apex of the bladder, and covered by peritoneum. 4. The umbilical artery at the point where it becomes obliterated, and forms a fibrous cord which passes forwards by the side of the bladder, and then ascends to the umbilicus. 5. The ureter. 6. The base of the bladder. 7. The fold of peritoneum formed between the rectum and bladder. 8. The anterior ligaments of the bladder. 9. The testicle. 10. 10. The vas deferens. 11.

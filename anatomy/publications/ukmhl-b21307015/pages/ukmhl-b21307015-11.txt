PREFACE. Vll For the correctness of the anatomical descriptions, the author pledges himself, and claims the entire confidence of the student;—they have not been copied from the works of his predecessors, but have been penned from the great book of Nature. Another object which the Author has kept in view, is, to place before the student the recent improve- ments that have been made in anatomical Science by modern and contemporary discoverers ; — for these he has consulted the works of Sir Astley Cooper, Dr. Grant, Kiernan, Swan, Guthrie, Stanley, Solly, Arnold, Horner, King, Hilton, Cocks, &c. The Author has a pleasing duty to perform in the public expression of his thanks to Mr. Liston, who kindly revised the surgical notices contained in the work; to Mr. Kiernan, for facilities in the examin- ation of his researches on the Liver; to Sir Astley Cooper, for the liberal display of his beautiful pre- parations of hernia, of the testis and of the thymus gland; to Mr. Guthrie, for a view of his preparations illustrating the deep perineal fascia, and compressor urethrae muscle ; to Mr. Dalrymple, for the demon- stration of his investigations upon the anatomy of the eye; and to Dr. Grant, for his friendly instruction on every point relating to comparative anatomy. The illustrations are principally derived from the class diagrams of the Author, and from designs made expressly for the work : — for the accuracy of deline- ation and delicacy of engraving, he is indebted to the skill of the eminent anatomical artists, the Messrs.

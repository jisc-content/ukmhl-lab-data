129 GREAT VESSELS OF THE HEART. G 5 The Veins accompany the arteries, and empty them- selves by the common coronary vein into the right auricle. The Lymphatics terminate in the glands about the root of the heart. Nerves. — The Nerves of the heart are derived from the cardiac plexuses, which are formed by communicating filaments from the sympathetic and pneumogastric. Great Vessels of the Heart. The Vessels at the root of the heart may be thus ar- ranged : — Superior and inferior cava, Pulmonary artery, Four pulmonary veins, Aorta. As all these vessels bear a certain relation to the aorta, we shall therefore commence by describing that trunk. The Aorta {fig. 12. 21, 22.) arises from the left ven- tricle, at the middle of the root of the heart. It ascends at first to the right, then curves backwards and to the left, and descends on the left side of the vertebral column to the fourth lumbar vertebra. Hence it is divided into the ascending, arch, and descending aorta. Relations. — The Ascending aorta has in relation with it, in front, the trunk of the pulmonary artery, thoracic fascia, and pericardium ; behind, the right pul- monary veins and artery ; to the right side, the right auricle and superior cava ; and to the left, the left auricle and trunk of the pulmonary artery.

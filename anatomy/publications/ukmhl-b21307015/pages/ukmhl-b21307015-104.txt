74 ANTERIOR THORACIC REGION MUSCLES. fibres of the upper portion of the muscle are inserted into the lower part of the ridge, and those of the lower portion into the upper part. The pectoralis major muscle is separated from the del- toid by a deep cellular interspace, in which are seen the cephalic vein and the descending branch of the thoracico- acromialis artery. (.Fig. 7. 11.) Dissection. â€” The pectoralis major is now to be removed by divid- ing its fibres along the lower border of the clavicle, and then carrying the incision perpendicularly downwards, parallel to the sternum, and at about three inches from its border. Divide some loose cellular tissue, and several small branches of the thoracic arteries, and reflect the muscle outwards. We thus bring into view a region of consider- able interest, from which the fat and cellular tissue must be carefully removed. In the middle of this region is the pectoralis minor muscle {fig- 7. 4.), and above it a triangular space bounded * Fig. 7. The vessels and nerves of the deep pectoral region. No. 1.

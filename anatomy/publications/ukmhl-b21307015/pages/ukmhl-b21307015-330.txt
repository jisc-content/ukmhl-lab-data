OPENINGS IN THE TYMPANUM. 300 The opening of the Meatus auditorius has been already described. The Fenestra ovalis {jig. 34. 3.) is an oval opening, situated in the upper part of the inner wall of the tym- panum, directly opposite the meatus ; it is the opening of communication between the tympanum and vestibule, and is closed by the foot of the stapes and by the lining membranes of both cavities. The Fenestra rotunda {jig. 34. 5.) is somewhat trian- gular in its form, and situated in the inner wall of the tympanum, below and rather posteriorly to the fenestra ovalis, from which it is separated by a bony elevation, called the promontory, 4. It serves to communicate the tympanum with the cochlea. In the fresh subject it is closed by a proper membrane, as well as by the mucous lining of both cavities. The Mastoid cells are very numerous, and occupy the whole of the interior of the mastoid process, and part of the petrous bone. They communicate by a large irregular opening {jig. 34. 12.) with the upper and posterior cir- cumference of the tympanum. The Eustachian tube {jig. 34. 6.) is a canal of commu- nication extending obliquely between the pharynx and the anterior circumference of the tympanum. In structure it is partly fibro-cartilaginous and partly osseous, is broad and expanded at its pharyngeal extremity, and narrow and compressed at the tympanum. Fig. 34.* * Fi". 34.

LOBES. FISSURES. 353 It is divided into five lobes, two principal and three minor lobes; they are the Right lobe, Left lobe, Lobulus quadratus, Spigelii, caudatus. The lobes are separated from each other by fissures, of which there are also five, viz., the Longitudinal fissure, Fissure for the ductus venosus, Transverse fissure, Fissure for the gall bladder, Fissure for the vena cava. The Bight and Left lobes are separated by the longitu- dinal fissure, and in front by the notch which lodges the round ligament. The right is much larger than the left, and presents the subdivisions which give rise to the minor lobes. The Lobulus quadratus is bounded in front by the free border of the liver, and, behind, by the transverse fissure; to the right by the gall bladder, and to the left by the longitudinal fissure. The Lobulus Spigelii* is a small triangular lobe, which is bounded in front by the transverse fissure, and on the sides by the fissures for the ductus venosus and vena cava. The Lobulus caudatus is a small tail-like appendage to the lobulus Spigelii, from which it runs outwards like a crest into the right lobe. In some livers it is extremely well marked, in others it is small and ill defined. The Longitudinal fissure runs from before backwards, commencing at a deep notch in the anterior border of the liver. At about half way between the anterior and posterior borders, it is joined by the transverse fissure which originates in the right lobe.

He assigned considerable importance to this little lobe, but it was described by Sylvius full si*ty years before him,

VENA AZYGOS. â€”THORACIC DUCT. 134 the right bronchus, and terminates in the superior cava. It receives all the intercostal veins of the right side, to- gether with the bronchial and vena azj'gos minor. The Vena azygos minor (fig. 13. 9.) commences in the lumbar region, on the left side, by a communication with the lumbar or renal veins. It passes beneath the border of the dia- phragm, and ascending upon the left side of the vertebral column, crosses the fifth or sixth dorsal vertebra to open into the vena azygos major, It receives the six or seven lower intercostal veins of the left side. The azygos veins are said to have no valves. The Superior intercostal vein {Jig. 13. 7.) is the trunk formed by the union of the five or six upper intercostal veins of the left side. It communicates be- low with the vena azygos minor, and ascends to terminate in the left vena innominata. The Thoracic duct {Jig. 11. 12.) arises in the abdomen from the receptaculum chyli, which is situated on the second lum- bar vertebra. It enters the tho- rax through the aortic opening in the diaphragm, behind and between the aorta and vena azygos. Then ascends per- * Fig. 13. The veins of the trunk. No. 1.

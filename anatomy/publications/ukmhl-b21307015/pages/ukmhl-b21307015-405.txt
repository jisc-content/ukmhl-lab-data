37 5 LUMBAR PLEXUS. BRANCHES. The Lumbar plexus of nerves is formed by the anterior branches of the last dorsal and four upper lumbar nerves. The posterior branches passing backwards, to be distri- buted to the muscles and integument of the loins. The anterior branches increase in size from above downwards, and the posterior diminish in like proportion. The plexus is connected by communicating branches passing from one nerve to the other at their exit from the intervertebral foramina, besides which, each trunk receives one or two filaments from the lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic. Hie Branches of the lumbar plexus are the Musculo-cutaneous, External cutaneous, Genito-crural, Crural, Obturator. The Musculo-cutaneous nerves {Jig- 2. 3.), two in number, proceed from the first lumbar nerve. They cross the quadratus lumborum muscle, and, piercing the transversalis, divide into two branches; a cutaneous branch, which pierces the muscle, and is distributed to the integument over the hip and buttock ; and a muscular branch, which winds along the crest of the ilium, and is distributed to the abdominal muscles, lying first between the transversalis and internal oblique, and then between the internal and the external oblique muscle. The supe- rior nerve, after piercing the fibres of the internal oblique muscle, passes through the external ring with the sper- matic cord, and is distributed to the scrotum; hence it is often called ilio-scrotal. The inferior nerve supplies the abdominal muscles. The External cutaneous nerve {Jig. 2. 4.) (inguino-cu- taneous) proceeds from the second lumbar nerve. It pierces tbe posterior fibres of the psoas muscle, and crossing the iliacus obliquely to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, passes into the thigh be- neath Poupartâ€™s ligament, and distributes cutaneous branches to the integument of the groin and of the outer side of the thigh : see page 12.

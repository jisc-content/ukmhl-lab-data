67 CHAPTER II. THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The upper extremity is the member developed from the upper part of the thoracic arch, as the lower ex- tremity is the member developed from the pelvic arch. It consists of an apparatus of bones, joints, muscles, vessels, and nerves, and is covered by the common in- vestments of the entire body, viz. the deep and super- ficial fascia, and the integument. The bones of the upper extremity are the clavicle, scapula, humerus, radius and ulna, carpal, metacarpal, and phalanges. The clavicle is the medium of connection between the upper extremity and the rest of the skeleton ; it is the fulcrum of action of the entire limb, and is prominently characteristic of animals possessing great power in their arms, as man, the bat, the mole, birds, &c. The scapula is a flat bone, and affords by its construction peculiar advantages; giving origin, by its extensive sur- face, to a number of muscles, and being itself movable on the convexity of the thorax. This is the bone which secures the connection of the arm to the trunk, and provides for all that diversity of movement so charac- teristic of the upper extremity, and which entitles it to the designation of an “universal joint.” The next bones, the humerus, radius, and itlna, have for their office the extension of the limb, for the purpose of supplying to the beautiful apparatus of the hand all the advantages which are to be obtained by a voluntary approximation or extension from the body. They are, therefore, denomi- nated loruj bones, and like all bones of this class are divisible into a shaft, an upper and a lower extremity. The shaft is more or less cylindrical and smooth, whilst the extremities are projected into processes which serve as levers for the attachment and action of muscles. The carpus is an assemblage of small bones belonging to the

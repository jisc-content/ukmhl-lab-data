4-52 ARTICULATION OF THE LOWER JAW. attached to its root, and others pass upwards to be at- tached to the basilar process of the occipital bone ; hence the ligament has a cross-like appearance, and is sometimes called cruciform. A synovial membrane is situated be- tween the transverse ligament and the odontoid process; and another between that process and the inner surface of the anterior arch of the atlas. 5. Articulation of the lower jaw. — The ligaments of this articulation are three in number ; to which may be added, as appertaining to the mechanism of the joint, an inter-articular fibro-cartiiage, and two synovial mem- branes : — External lateral, Internal lateral, Capsular. Inter-articular fibro-cartiiage, Two synovial membranes. The External lateral ligament is a short band of fibres, passing from the tubercle of the zigoma, to the external surface of the neck of the lower jaw. The Internal lateral ligament is a thin band of liga- mentous fibres, extending between the extremity of the spinous process of the sphenoid bone to the margin of the dental foramen. It is pierced at its insertion by the mylo- hyoidean nerve. A triangular space is left between the internal lateral ligament and the neck of jaw, in which are situated the internal maxillary artery and auricular nerve, and inferior dental artery and nerve. The Capsular ligament is thin and loose, and completely surrounds the joint. It is lined upon its inner surface by the synovial membranes, and is firmly connected with the inter-articular cartilage, which it serves to keep in its place. The Liter-articular fibro-cartiiage is a thin oval plate, thicker at the edges than in the centre, placed horizontally between the head of the condyle of the lower jaw and the glenoid cavity. It is connected by its circumference with the capsular ligament, and is sometimes incomplete in the centre. It divides the joint into two distinct cavities, one above and the other below the cartilage, which are each

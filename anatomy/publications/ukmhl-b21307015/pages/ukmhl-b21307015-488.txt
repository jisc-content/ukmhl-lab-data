458 LIGAMENTS. UPPER EXTREMITY. The Obturator ligament or membrane is not a ligament of articulation, but simply a tendino-fibrous membrane stretched across the obturator foramen. It gives attach- ment by its surfaces to the two obturator muscles; and it leaves a space in the upper part of the foramen for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve. Ligaments of the Upper Extremity. The Ligaments of the ripper extremity may be arranged in the order of the articulations between the different bones ; they are, the 1. Sterno-clavicular articulation. 2. Scapulo-clavicular articulation. 3. Ligaments of the scapula. 4. Shoulder joint. 5. Elbow joint. 6. Radio-ulnar articulation. 7. Wrist joint. 8. Articulation between the carpal bones. 9. Carpo-metacarpal articulation. 10. Metacarpo-phalangeal articulation. 11. Articulation of the phalanges. 1. The Sterno-clavicular articulation. The ligaments of this articulation are, Anterior sterno-clavicular, Posterior sterno-clavicular, Interclavicular, Costo-clavicular (rhomboid), Interarticular fibro-cartilage. Two synovial membranes, The Anterior sterno-clavicular ligament is a broad liga- mentous layer, covering the anterior aspect of the articu- lation. The Posterior sterno-clavicular ligament is a broad fas- ciculus covering its posterior surface. The Interclavicular ligament crosses from the extremity of one clavicle to the other, and is closely connected with the upper border of the sternum. The Costo-clavicular ligament (rhomboid') is a thick fasciculus of fibres connecting the sternal extremity of

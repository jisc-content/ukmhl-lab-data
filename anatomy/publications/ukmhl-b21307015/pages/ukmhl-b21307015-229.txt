199 BRANCHES. of the lung to the oesophagus, which it accompanies to the stomach, lying on its posterior aspect. The left enters the chest parallel with the left sub- clavian artery, crosses the arch of the aorta, and descends behind the root of the lung, and along the anterior surface of the oesophagus, to the stomach. The two nerves communicate freely with each other on the stomach, and with the solar plexus. The Branches of the pneumogastric nerve are the fol- lowing : — Communicating branches with the Facial, Glosso-pharyngeal, Spinal accessory, Lingual, Sympathetic. Pharyngeal, Superior laryngeal, Cardiac, Inferior or recurrent laryngeal, Pulmonary anterior, Pulmonary posterior, CEsophageal, Gastric. The Branches of communication are the same, with the addition of the lingual, as those we before noticed in connection with the glosso-pharyngeal. The Pharyngeal nerve {fig. 19. 11.) arises from the pneumogastric, close to the foramen lacerum posterius, and descends behind the internal carotid artery to the upper border of the middle constrictor, upon which it forms the pharyngeal plexus {fig. 19.*), assisted by branches from the glosso-pharyngeal, superior laryngeal, and sympathetic. I he Superior laryngeal nerve {fig. 19. 12.) arises from the inferior ganglion of the pneumogastric, of which it appears almost a continuation ; hence the ganglion has been named by Sir Astley Cooper the “ ganglion of the superior laryngeal branch." The nerve descends behind K 4>

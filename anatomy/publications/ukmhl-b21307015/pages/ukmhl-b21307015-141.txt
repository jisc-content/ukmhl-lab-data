Ill INTEROSSEI MUSCLES. Fig. 10.* third (Jiff. 9.5. 5., fig. 10. 5.5.) are inserted into the middle finger, compensating its exclusion from the palmar group; the fourth (Jig. 10. 7.) is attached to the ring finger; so that each finger is provided with two interossei, with the exception of the little finger, as may be shown by a table. T j f one dorsal (abductor indicis), fig. 10. 3. J * ** l one palmar, Jig. 10. 4. Middle Jinger, two dorsal, Jig. 10. 5. 5. * Fig. 10. A diagram showing the abductor and adductor mus- cles of the hand, and the attachments and actions of the interossei. The middle finger is made longer than the rest, in order to mark the central axis of the hand, to which the movements of abduction and adduction are referrible. The dotted lines represent the six ab- ductor muscles, and the plain lines the four adductors. No. 1. The abductor pollicis, arising from the scaphoid bone. 2. The adductor pollicis, arising from the whole length of the middle metacarpal bone. 3. The first dorsal interosseous, the abductor of the index finger: all the dorsal interossei arise by two heads, as is seen in the diagram. 4. The first palmar interosseous, the adductor of the index finger. 5. 5. The second and third dorsal interossei muscles, both abductors of the middle finger. 6. The second palmar interosseous, adductor of the ring-finger. 7. The fourth dorsal in- terosseous, abductor of the ring-finger. 8. The third palmar inter- osseous, adductor of the little finger. 9. The abductor of the little finger, arising from the pisiform bone.

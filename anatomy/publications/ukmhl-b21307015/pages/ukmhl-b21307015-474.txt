444; RENAL CAPSULES. URACHUS. rapidly after birth, probably from the obliteration of the umbilical vein. The Kidneys present a lobulated appearance in the foetus, which is the permanent type amongst some animals, as in the bear. The Re?ial capsules are organs which appear, from their early and considerable development, to belong especially to the economy of the foetus. They are distinctly formed at the second month of embryo life, and are greater in size and weight than the kidneys. At the fourth month they are equalled in bulk by the kidneys, and at birth they are about one-third less than those organs. Viscera of the Pelvis. The Bladder in the foetus is long and conical, and is situated altogether above the upper border of the pubis, which is as yet small and undeveloped. It is, in point of fact, an abdominal viscus. It is connected superiorly w ith a fibrous cord, called the urachus, of which it almost appears an expansion. The Urachus is continued upwards to the umbilicus, and becomes connected with the umbilical cord. In ani- mals it is a pervious duct, and is continuous with one of the membranes of the embryo â€” the allantois. It has been found pervious in the human foetus, and the urine has been passed through the umbilicus. Calculous con- cretions have also been found in its course. The Uterus, in the early periods of embryo existence, appears to be bifid, from the large size of the Fallopian tubes, and the small development of the body of the organ. At the end of the fourth month, the body assumes a larger bulk, and the bifid appearance is lost. The cervix uteri in the foetus is larger than the body of the organ. The Ovaries are situated, like the testicles, in the lumbar region near to the kidneys, and descend from thence gradually into the pelvis. Organs of Generation. The Testicles in the embryo are situated in the lumbar regions immediately below the kidneys. The spermatic

ENCYSTED HERNIA. 334 of the sac of the tunica vaginalis ; the intestine, in its descent, passes along the open canal left by the transit of the testicle, and enters the tunica vaginalis, being in actual contact with the testicle. The sac of congenital hernia is, therefore, the tunica vaginalis itself. In other respects it exactly resembles com- mon oblique hernia. In Encysted hernia f (fig- 4-2.) (hernia infantilis of Hey) the neck of the pouch of the tunica vaginalis is closed only at the upper part, and the hernia carrying with it a peritoneal sac descends behind the tunica vaginalis, so that, in operat- ing, the surgeon opens first the tunica vaginalis, and, finding no hernia, cuts through its other side until he reaches the hernial sac. He thus divides three layers of serous membrane, before arriving at the intestine. In other respects the hernia resembles common ob- lique inguinal. The Arteries of the abdominal parietes are the superficial and deep epigastric, superficial and deep circumflex ilii, internal mam- mary, inferior intercostal, and lum- bar. The Lymphatics accompany the veins, those from the lower part of the abdomen passing into the in- * Fig. 40. Common oblique inguinal hernia.

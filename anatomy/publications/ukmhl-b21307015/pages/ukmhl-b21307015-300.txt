270 SPINAL CORD. position of the spinal cord in the midst of the fluid by which it is surrounded. The Spinal cord extends from the pons Varolii to opposite the second lumbar vertebra, where it terminates in a rounded point: it is not of the same thickness through- out, but presents three enlargements. The uppermost of these is the medulla oblongata, the next corresponds with the origin of the nerves destined to the upper extremities; and the lower enlargement is situated near to its termi- nation, and corresponds with the attachment of the nerves which are intended for the supply of the lower limb. In form the spinal cord is a flattened cylinder, and presents on its anterior surface a groove (fig- 28.8.), which extends into the cord to the depth of one third of its diameter. This is the sulcus longitudinalis anterior. If the sides of the groove be gently separated, they will be seen to be connected at the bottom by a layer of medullary substance, 9. * Fig. 28.

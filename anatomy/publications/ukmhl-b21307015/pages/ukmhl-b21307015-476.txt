446 CHAPTER XIII. ON THE LIGAMENTS. The mechanism by which the different bones of the ske- leton are connected with each other is called a “joint.” Every bone in the body articulates with one or more bones, and as each differs from the other in its form and in its use, we are prepared to expect a great variety in the forms of joints. They may all, however, be reduced to three classes—1. Synarthrosis; 2. Amphi-arthrosis; and 3. Diarthrosis. Synarthrosis (<rw, together; apQpuan;, articulation,) is that form of joint in which the bones are intimately and immoveahly connected with each other. There are four kinds of synarthrosis. 1. Harmonia (apu, to adapt,) in which the bones merely lie in opposition with each other; as in the palate pro- cesses of the superior maxillary and palate bones with those of the opposite side, and with each other; the ba- silar process of the occipital bone with that of the sphe- noid ; the nasal bones with each other, and with the superior maxillary bones. 2. Schindylesis (erxivdvXvja-K;, a fissure,) in which a pro- jection of one bone is inserted into a groove or fissure in another; as in the articulations of the vomer with the rostrum of the sphenoid, and with the central lamella of the ethmoid bone. 3. Gomphosis (yog<po$, a nail,) a mode of articulation, of which the insertion of the teeth into the alveolar pro- cesses is the only example; their roots being fixed into the alveoli, like nails into a board. 4. Sutura (sutura, a seam,) is the most solid of the four forms of synarthrosis; it is that which is employed for the articulation of the flat bones of the skull with each other. It presents two varieties, sutura serrata, which is illustrated in the serrated union of the frontal with the parietal bones, the parietal bones with each

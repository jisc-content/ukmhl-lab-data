FACIAL ARTERY. 181 The Dorsalis linguae ascends along the posterior border of the hyo-glossus muscle to the dorsum of the tongue, where it is distributed, anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side. The Sublingual branch runs along the anterior border of the hyo-glossus, and is distributed to the sublingual gland and muscles of the tongue. 3. Facial artery. {Fig. 15. 14.)—The facial artery as- cends obliquely to the submaxillary gland, in which it lies embedded. It then curves around the body of the lower jaw, close to the anterior inferior angle of the masseter muscle, ascends to the angle of the mouth, and thence to the angle of the eye, where it is named the angular artery. Relations.— Below the jaw it passes beneath the digastricus and stylo-hyoid muscles, and at the angle of the mouth beneath the zigomatic muscles. Its branches are divided into those which are given off below the jaw and those on the face : they may be thus arranged, — (3.) Facial artery. — Branches. Below the jaw. Inferior palatine, Submaxillary, Sub-mental. On the face. Masseteric, Inferior labial, Inferior coronary, Superior coronary, Lateralis nasi. The Inferior palatine branch ascends between the stylo-glossusandstylo-pharyngeus muscles, to be distributed to the tonsil and soft palate. The Submaxillary are the numerous small branches supplying the submaxillary gland. rl he Sub-mental branch runs forwards upon the mylo- hyoid muscle, under cover of the body of the lower jaw, and anastomoses with branches of the sublingual and inferior dental arteries.

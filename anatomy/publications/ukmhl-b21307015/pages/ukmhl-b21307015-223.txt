VERTEBRAL ARTERY. BRANCHES. 193 The branches of the Vertebral artery are, — Branches. 'Lateral spinal, Anterior spinal, Vertebral- Posterior spinal, Posterior meningeal, Inferior cerebellar. ' Transverse, Basilar - Superior cerebellar, _ Posterior cerebral. The Lateral spinal branches enter the intervertebral foramina, and are distributed to the dura mater of the spinal cord. The Anterior spinal is a small branch which unites with its fellow of the opposite side, on the front of the medulla oblongata. The artery formed by the union of these two vessels descends along the anterior aspect of the spinal cord, to which it distributes branches as far as the cauda equina. The Posterior spinal is a small branch running down the posterior surface of the spinal cord, parallel with its : fellow of the opposite side, and distributing branches as far as the cauda equina. The Posterior meningeal is a small branch to the dura mater, lining the inferior occipital fossae. The Inferior cerebellar artery is distributed to the under surface of the cerebellum. Basilar Artery. — Branches. The Transverse branches of the basilar artery supply ! the pons Varolii, and adjacent parts of the brain. The Superior cerebellar and Posterior cerebral arteries are the terminal branches of the basilar. The superior cerebellar is distributed to the upper surface of the cere- bellum, and the posterior cerebral to the posterior lobes of the cerebrum, inosculating on the corpus callosum with the anterior cerebral arteries. They are separated from each other at their commencement by the third nerve. The Thyroid axis (fig. 18. 8.) is a short trunk which immediately divides into its four branches.

264 AUDITORY NERVE. 7th pair, Auditory (portio mollis). — This nerve (jig- 27.) arises from the anterior wall or floor, 4., of the fourth ventricle, by means of the white fibres, linece transverse, * Fig. 26. The origin and distribution of the optic nerves. Nos. 1. 1. The thalami optici, their upper surface. 2. The mid- dle commissure of the third ventricle, connecting the two thalami. 3. The posterior commissure of the third ventricle. 4. The foramen commune posterius. 5. The corpus geniculatum internum. 6. The corpus geniculatum externum. 7. The corpora quadrigemina: the anterior pair are the nates, the posterior the testes. 8. One root of the optic nerve, arising from the corpus geniculatum externum. 9. The other root, arising from the nates. 10. The commissure. 11. The expansion of the optic nerve into the retina. 12. A section of the retina, showing its three layers : the external is Jacob’s mem- brane, the next the nervous, and the internal the vascular, formed by the ramifications of the arteria centralis retina;, which is seen at 13. piercing the optic nerve, and running forwards in the centre of that nerve.

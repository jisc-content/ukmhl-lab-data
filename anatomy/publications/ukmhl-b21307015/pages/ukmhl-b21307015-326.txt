296 ORGAN OR HEARING. The Pinna presents a number of folds and hollows upon its surface, which have different names assigned to them. Thus the external folded margin is called the helix a fold). The elevation parallel to and in front of the helix is called antihelix (avrt, opposite). The pointed process, projecting like a valve over the opening of the ear from the face, is called the tragus (rpayos, a goat), probably from being sometimes covered with bristly hair like that of a goat; and a tubercle oppo- site to it is the antitragus. The lower dependent and fleshy portion of the pinna is the lohulus. The space between the helix and antihelix is named the fossa inno- minata. Another depression is observed on the upper extremity of the antihelix, which bifurcates and leaves a triangular space between its branches called the scaphoid fossa; and the large central space to which all the channels converge is the concha, which opens directly into the meatus. The pinna is composed of integument, fibro-carlilage, and muscles. The Integument is thin, and closely connected with the fibro-cartilage. The Fibro-cartilage gives form to the pinna, and sur- rounds the commencement of the meatus. It is firmly attached to the external auditory process, and is deficient in the lobulus. The proper Muscles of the pinna are the Major helicis, Minor helicis, Tragicus, Antitragicus, Transversus auriculae. The Major helicis is a narrow band of muscular fibres situated upon the anterior border of the helix, just above the tragus. The Minor helicis is placed upon the posterior ex- tremity of the helix. The Tragicus is a thin layer of muscular fibres, situated upon the tragus. The Antitragicus arises from the antitragus, and is in* serted into the posterior part of the helix.

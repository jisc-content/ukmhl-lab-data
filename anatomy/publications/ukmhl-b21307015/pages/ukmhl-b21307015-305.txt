275 n 6 CHAPTER VII. ORGANS OF SENSE. The Nose and Nasal Fossae. The organ of smell consists essentially of two parts : one external, the nose; the other internal, the nasal fossai. The Nose is the triangular pyramid projecting from the centre of the face, immediately above the upper lip. Superiorly, it is connected with the forehead, by means of a narrow bridge ; inferiorly, it presents two openings, the I nostrils, which overhang the mouth, and are so constructed that the odour of all substances must be received by the nose, before they can be introduced within the lips. The septum between the openings of the nostrils is called the columna. Their entrance is guarded by a number of stiff I hairs (vibrissce), which project across the openings, and act as a filter in preventing the introduction of foreign substances, such as dust, or insects, with the current of air intended for respiration. The anatomical elements of which the nose is composed are,â€”1. The integument; 2. Muscles; 3. Bones ; 4. Fibro- cartilages; 5. Mucous membrane ; 6. Vessels and nerves. 1. The Integument forming the tip (lobulus) and wings (alee) of the nose is extremely thick and dense, so as to be with difficulty separated from the fibro-cartilage. It is furnished with a number of sebaceous follicles, which by their oily secretion, protect the extremity of the nose in excessive alternations of temperature. The sebaceous matter of these follicles becomes of a dark colour upon, the surface, from the attraction of the carbonaceous matter floating in the atmosphere : hence the spotted appearance which the tip of the nose presents in large cities. When the integument is firmly compressed, the inspissated sebaceous secretion is squeezed out from the follicles, and retaining t e orm of their interior, has the appearance of small white maggots with black heads.

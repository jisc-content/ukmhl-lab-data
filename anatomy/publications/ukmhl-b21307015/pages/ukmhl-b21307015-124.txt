94 FORE-ARM. MUSCLES. other, forming the anterior annular ligament; posteriorly it forms another band less thick than the anterior. It is attached to the bones by each extremity of the posterior annular ligament, and binds down the extensor tendons as they pass forwards to the hand. In the palm of the hand is a dense tendinous fascia, the palmar, which is analogous to the dense layer which we previously examined in the sole of the foot, the plantar fascia. The Palmar fascia is narrow towards the wrist, and attached to the annular ligament. Approaching the base of the fingers it becomes broad, and divides into four slips, each of which is subdivided into two smaller slips, which are inserted into the sides of the bases of the first phalanges, giving passage to the flexor tendons. The point of division of these slips is strengthened by a strong interlacement of transverse fibres. Muscles of the Fore-arm. The deep fascia of the fore-arm may now be divided and turned aside, and the superficial layer of muscles of the fore-arm examined. There are eight muscles on the anterior aspect of the fore-arm, all flexors and pronators, five in the superficial layer, and three in the deep. The superficial muscles in their order, from radius to ulna, are Anterior Aspect.â€” Superficial Group. Pronator radii teres, Flexor carpi radialis, Palmaris longus. Flexor sublimis digitorum. Flexor carpi ulnaris. The Pronator radii teres arises by two heads, one from the inner condyle of the humerus and fascia of the fore- arm, the other from the coronoid process of the ulna; the median nerve passing between them. Its tendon is inserted into the middle third of the oblique ridge of the radius. The two heads of this muscle are best seen, by cutting away that which arises from the inner condyle, and turning it aside. The second head will then be seen with the median nerve lying across it.

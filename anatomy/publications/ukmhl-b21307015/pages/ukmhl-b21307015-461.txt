SACRAL GANGLIA. 431 form and mode of connection, although they are much smaller in size. The Superior and inferior branches communicate with the ganglia above and below. The External branches communicate with the sacral and coccygeal nerves. The Internal branches communicate very freely with the lateral divisions of the hypogastric plexus, and are distributed to the pelvic viscera. The last sacral ganglia of opposite sides give off branches which join a small ganglion, situated on the first bone of the coccyx, called the ganglion impar, or azygos, 18. This ganglion resembles in its position and function the ganglion of Ribes, serving to connect the inferior extremity of the sympathetic nerve, as does the former ganglion its upper extremity. It gives off a few small branches to the coccyx.

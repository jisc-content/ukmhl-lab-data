BOUNDARIES OF THE TYMPANUM. 302 2. In the Inner wall (Jig. 34.), from above downwards, are the Ridge of the aqueductus Fallopii, 2., Fenestra ovalis, 3., Promontory, 4., Grooves for Jacobson’s nerve, Fenestra rotunda, 5. 3. In the Posterior to all are the Opening of the mastoid cells, 12., Pyramid, ll., Opening for the stapedius, Apertura chordae (entrance), lo. 4. In the Anterior ivall are the Eustachian tube, 6., Opening for the tensor tympani, 7., Opening for the laxator tympani, 8., Apertura chordae (exit), 9. The tympanum is lined by a vascular mucous membrane, which invests the ossicula and chorda tympani, and forms the internal layer of the membrana tympani. From the tympanum it is reflected into the mastoid cells, which it lines throughout, and passes through the Eustachian tube to become continuous with the mucous membrane of the pharynx. Vessels and nerves. — The Arteries of the tympanum are derived from the internal maxillary, internal carotid, and posterior auricular. Its Nerves are — I. Minute branches of the facial, which are distributed to the muscles. 2. The chorda tympani, which leaves the facial nerve near the stylo- mastoid foramen, and arches upwards to enter the tym- panum at the root of the pyramid ; it then passes forwards between the handle of the malleus and long process of the incus, to the opening in the fissura Glaseri. 3. The tympanic branches of Jacobson's nerve, which are distri- buted to the membranes of the fenestra ovalis and fenestra rotunda, and to the Eustachian tube, and form a plexus by communicating with the carotid plexus and otic gan- glion.

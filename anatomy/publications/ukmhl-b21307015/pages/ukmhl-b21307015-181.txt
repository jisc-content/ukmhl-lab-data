NASAL GROUP. SUPERIOR LABIAL GROUP. 151 H 4 The Tensor tarsi (Horner’s # muscle) is a thin plane of muscular fibres, about three lines in breadth and six in length. It is best dissected by separating the eyelids from the eye, and turning them over the nose without disturbing the tendo oculi; then dissect away the small fold of mucous membrane called plica semilunaris, and some loose cellular tissue under which the muscle is con- cealed. It arises from the orbital surface of the lachrymal bone, and passing across the lachrymal sac divides into two slips, which are inserted into the lachrymal ducts as far as the puncta. 3. Nasal Group. Pyramidalis nasi, Compressor nasi. The Pyramidalis nasi is a pyramidal slip of muscular fibres sent downwards upon the nose by the occipito- frontalis. It is inserted into the tendinous expansion of the compressores nasi. The Compressor nasi muscle arises from the canine fossa on the superior maxillary bone, and spreads upon the side of the nose into a thin tendinous expansion, which is continuous across its ridge with that from the opposite side. 4. Superior Labial Group. Orbicularis oris, Levator labii superioris ala^que nasi, Levator labii superioris proprius, Levator anguli oris, Zigomaticus major, Zigomaticus minor, Depressor labii superioris alaeque nasi. To obtain a complete view of the Orbicularis oris muscle, the integument should be raised from the whole circumference of the mouth. It is, however, sufficient for our present purpose to see only a part of the muscle. It is the sphincter of the mouth, and encircles it entirely, * \V. E Ilorner, M.

460 LIGAMENTS OF THE SHOULDER-JOINT. ginous surfaces of the two bones between which it is placed. The synovial membranes are very delicate. Dislocations.— The scapular end of the clavicle can be dislocated in one direction only, viz. upwards. If the dislocation be severe, the coraco-clavicular ligament is completely ruptured. It is a more frequent accident than dislocation of the sternal end of the clavicle. 3. The Proper ligaments of the Scapula are, the Coraco-acromial, Transverse. The Coraco-acromial ligament is a broad and thick band, which is attached to the coracoid and acromial processes of the scapula, and forms a protecting arch over the shoulder joint. The Transverse or coracoid ligament is a narrow fas- ciculus which crosses the notch in the upper border of the scapula, and converts it into a foramen. 4. The Shoulder joint. — The ligaments of the scapulo- humeral articulation are, the Capsular, Coraco-humeral, Glenoid. The Capsular ligament completely encircles the arti- culating head of the scapula and the head of the humerus, and is attached to the neck of each bone. It is thick above, where resistance is most required, and is strength- ened by the tendons of the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis muscles : below it is thin and loose. The capsule is incomplete at the point of con- tact with the tendons of the muscle, so that they obtain upon their inner surface a covering of synovial membrane. The Coraco-humeral ligament is a broad band which descends obliquely from the coracoid process to the neck of the humerus, and serves to strengthen the capsular ligament. The Glenoid ligament is formed by the splitting of the tendon of the long head of the biceps, which divides at its origin into two slips, which are attached around the margin of the glenoid depression, and deepen its cavity. The cavity of the articulation is traversed by the long

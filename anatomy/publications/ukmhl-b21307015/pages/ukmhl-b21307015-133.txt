103 MUSCULO-SPIRAL NERVE. and divides into branches which supply two fingers and a half on the posterior aspect of the hand, and communicate with the radial nerve. The Superficial palmar branch divides into four fila- ments, which are distributed to the ulnar border of the hand, to the ulnar side of the little finger, to the adjoining borders of the little and ring fingers, and a communicating branch is sent to join the median nerve. The Deep palmar branch passes between the abductor and flexor minimi digiti, to the deep palmar arch, supplying all the deep parts in the palm of the hand. Musculo-spiral Nerve. The Musculo-spircd nerve, at the bend of the elbow, divides into two branches of nearly equal size, the radial and posterior interosseous. The Radial runs along the radial side of the fore arm to the commencement of its lower third; it then passes beneath the tendon of the supinator longus to the back of the wrist and hand, where it supplies two fingers and a half, and communicates with the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve. It gives off a few branches to the muscles on the radial side of the fore arm. Relations. â€” In the upper third of the fore-arm it lies beneath the border of the supinator longus muscle. In the middle third it is in relation with the radial artery, lying to its outer side. It then quits the artery, ancl passes beneath the tendon of the supinator longus, to reach the back of the hand. The Posterior interosseous nerve separates from the radial at the bend of the elbow, pierces the supinator brevis muscle, and emerges from its lower border on the posterior aspect of the fore-arm, where it divides into branches which supply the whole of the muscles on the posterior aspect of the fore-arm. One branch, longer than the rest, descends to the posterior part of the wrist- joint, where it forms a large gangliform swelling (the common character of nerves which supply joints), from which numerous branches are distributed to the wrist- joint.

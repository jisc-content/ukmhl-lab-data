22 PROFUNDA ARTERY. ceal the artery from view. The adductor longus would also be dissected from its insertion with advantage. The Course of the profunda artery is downwards and backwards, and a little outwards, behind the adductor longus muscle ; it then pierces the adductor magnus, and is distributed to the ham-string muscles. Relations.â€” It rests successively upon the conjoined tendon of the psoas and iliacus, the pectineus, adductor brevis, and adductor magnus muscles. To its outer side, the ten- dinous insertion of the vastus internus muscle intervenes beween it and the femur, and in front it is separated from the femoral artery above by the profunda vein and femoral vein; and below by the adductor longus muscle. Plan of the relations of the profunda artery. In Front. Profunda vein. Adductor longus. Outer Side. Vastus internus femur. Behind. Tendon of psoas and iliacus. Pectineus. Adductor brevis. Adductor magnus. The branches of the profunda artery are the external circumflex, internal circumflex, and three perforating ar- teries. The External circumflex artery passes outwards between the divisions of the crural nerve, then between the rectus and crureus muscles, and divides into three branches; ascending, which inosculates with the terminal branches of the gluteal artery; descending, which inosculates with the superior external articular artery ; and middle, which continues the original course of the artery around the thigh, and anastomoses with branches of the ischiatic, internal circumflex, and superior perforating arteries. It supplies the muscles on the anterior and outer side of the thigh. The Internal circumflex artery winds around the inner side of the neck of the femur, passing between the pec- Profunda artery.

MUSCLES. 229 The Scalenus anticus appears like a continuation of the rectus anticus major ; it arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the tubercle upon the first rib. The phrenic nerve and subclavian vein lie upon the scalenus anticus, and the subclavian artery behind it. The Scalenus posticus arises from the posterior tuber- cles of all the cervical vertebrae excepting the first. It is inserted by two fleshy slips into the first and second ribs. The Longus colli consists of two portions. The upper arises from the anterior tubercle of the atlas, and is in- serted into the transverse processes of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebrae. The lower portion arises from the bodies of the second, third, and fourth, and transverse processes of the fourth and fifth, and passes down the neck to be inserted into the bodies of the three lower cervical and three upper dorsal vertebrae. We ; should thus arrange these attachments in a tabular ; form : — Origin. Upper \ I j portion. J Atlas Insertion. 3d, 4th, and 5th transverse pro- cesses. Lower portion. 2d, 3d, and 4th bodies 4th and 5th transverse processes ' 3 lower cervical vertebras, bo- dies. 3 upper dorsal, bodies. 1 h v In general terms, the muscle is attached to the bodies and transverse processes of the five superior cervical ver- tebrae above, and to the bodies of the three last cervical and three first dorsal below. Actions. — The rectus anticus major and minor pre- serve the equilibrium of the head upon the atlas. The longus colli flexes, the anterior part of the vertebral column, and the scaleni are inspiratory muscles raising the first and second ribs.

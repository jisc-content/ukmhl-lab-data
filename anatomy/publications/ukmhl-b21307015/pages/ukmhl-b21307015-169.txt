139 CHAPTER IV. REGION OF THE BACK. It is customary in most dissecting-rooms to turn the body upon its face after the lapse of a few days, that the student may have an opportunity of studying the muscles of the back and the posterior parts of the limbs. The student must, therefore, endeavour to accommodate his dissection to these rules. The region of the hack is, from its extent, common to the neck, the upper extremities, and the abdomen. The muscles of which it is composed are numerous, and may be arranged into six layers. First Layer. Transversalis colli, Trapezius, Trachelo-mastoideus, Latissimus dorsi. Complexus. Second Layer. Levator anguli scapulae, Fifth Layer. (Dorsal Group.) Rhomboideus minor, Rhomboideus major. Semi spinalis dorsi, Semi spinalis colli, Third Layer. Serratus posticus superior. Rectus anticus major, Rectus anticus minor, Rectus lateralis, (Cervical Group.) Serratus posticus inferior, Splenius capitis, Splenius colli. Obliquus inferior, Obliquus superior. Fourth Layer. (Dorsal Group.) Sixth Layer. Sacro lumbalis, Longissimus dorsi, Spinalis dorsi. Multifidus spinae, Levatores costarum, Supra-spinales, Inter-spinales, Inter-transversales. (Cervical Group.) Cervicalis ascendens,

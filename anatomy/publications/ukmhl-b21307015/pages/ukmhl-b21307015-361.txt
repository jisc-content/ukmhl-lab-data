OBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA. 331 ♦ Idominal parietes, near to Poupart’s ligament, which trans- mits the spermatic cord. It is about an inch and a half in length, is terminated at one extremity by the internal ring, and at the other by the external ring. It is bounded in front by the aponeurosis of the external oblique, and behind by the fascia transversalis {fig- 38.5.) and conjoined tendon, 6.; above by the lower margins of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, and below by the folded edges of Poupart’s ligament. It is along this oblique canal that the hernial protrusion travels in its passage from the abdomen : hence it is named Oblique inguinal hernia. The intestine, pushing before it a sac of peritoneum, enters the internal ring, and receives from it the infundibilform process of the trans- versalis fascia, which, in the absence of hernia, invests the spermatic cord alone. It then passes beneath the lower border of the transversalis muscle, but without any immediate relation. It next passes beneath the lower border of the internal oblique, and receives the cremaster muscle as a covering. Lastly, emerging from the external abdominal ring, it obtains the inter-columnar fascia, and becomes placed beneath the superficial fascia and inte- gument. The different layers which it thus obtains in its progress, and which the surgeon must cut through, were he called to operate on a strangulated hernia of this kind, the coverings of the hernia,, as they are technically called, are, the Integument, Superficial fascia, Inter-columnar fascia, Cremaster, Fascia transversalis, Peritoneal sac. If the hernia be small and become strangulated while situated within the spermatic canal, the external wall of No. 1. Poupart’s ligament. 2. The transversalis fascia. 3.

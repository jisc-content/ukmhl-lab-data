369 INFERIOR CAVA. R 5 in the chest; they are five in number on each side, and curve around the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, beneath the psoas muscles, and divide into two branches; one of which passes backwards between the transverse processes, and is distributed to the muscles of the back, whilst the other supplies the abdominal muscles. In passing be- tween the psoas muscles and the vertebrae, they are pro- tected by a series of tendinous arches, which defend them and the communicating branches of the sympathetic from pressure during the action of the muscle. The Sacra media arises from the aorta at its bifurcation into the two iliacs ; it descends along the front of the sacrum, giving branches on either side, which enter the anterior sacral foramina, and supply the sacral nerves. The Inferior vena cava {fig. 13. 10.) commences at the fourth lumbar vertebra, being formed by the union of the two common iliac veins, 11. 11. It ascends along the front of the vertebral column on the right side of the aorta, and reaches the posterior border of the liver. It then passes through a groove in that organ, and through the opening in the central tendon of the diaphragm, and terminates in the under part of the right auricle. Relations. — It is crossed in front by the pancreas transverse duodenum and mesentery, and behind by the right renal and lumbar arteries. To its left is the aorta, and on the right the sympathetic nerve. Branches. — The branches which the inferior vena cava receives in the abdomen, are the Vena-sacra media {fig. 13. 14.) Lumbar - - 15. Right spermatic - - 16. Renal - - 17. 18. Hepatic - - 19. The Vena-sacra media {fig. 13. 14.) terminates at the junction of the two common iliac veins. The Lumbar veins, 15. 15., return the venous blood rom the muscles of the posterior part of the abdomen, ind from the spinal veins. The upper lumbar branches communicate with the azygos veins.

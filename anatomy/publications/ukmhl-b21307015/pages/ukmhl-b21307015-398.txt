368 ABDOMINAL AORTA. BRANCHES. Branches. â€” The branches of the abdominal aorta, in their order of origin, are the Phrenic, ' Gastric, Coeliacaxis- Hepatic, _ Splenic, Superior mesenteric, Supra-renal, Renal, Spermatic, Inferior mesenteric, Lumbar, Sacra-media. The Phrenic are two small arteries which are distri- buted upon the under surface of the diaphragm. The Cceliac axis is destined to the supply of the sto- mach and duodenum, liver, spleen, pancreas, and omen- tum : page 350. The Superior mesenteric artery is distributed to the jejunum, ileum, coecum, ascending and transverse colon : page 348. The Supra-renal are two small vessels, sometimes branches, of the phrenic or renal arteries, distributed to the renal capsules. The Penal arteries are two large trunks given off on each side of the aorta to the kidneys ; the right is longer than the left, from the position of the aorta, and crosses behind the vena cava to reach the kidney. The Spermatic arteries are two small vessels given off from the front of the aorta ; they pass outwards to the ureters, which they accompany for a short distance, then leave them, and cross the iliacus muscle on each side to the internal abdominal ring, through which they descend along the spermatic canal to the testicle. They are each accompanied by two spermatic veins. These arteries, in the female, are distributed to the ovaries. The Inferior mesenteric artery supplies the descending colon, sigmoid flexure, and upper part of the rectum : page 349. The Lumbar arteries correspond with the intercostals

DEPRESSORS OF THE LARYNX. 160 clavicle (k\e3iovs), and passes obliquely upwards and backwards to be inserted into the mastoid process and superior curved line of the occipital bone. The sternal portion arises by a rounded tendon, increases in breadth as it ascends, and spreads out to a considerable extent at its insertion. The clavicular portion is broad and fleshy, and separate from the sternal portion below, but becomes gradually blended with its posterior surface as it ascends. Actions. — The platysma produces a muscular traction on the integument of the neck, which prevents it from falling so flaccid in old persons as it would if the exten- sion of the skin were the mere result of elasticity. It draws also upon the angle of the mouth. The sterno- mastoid muscles are the great anterior muscles of con- nection between the thorax and the head. Both muscles acting together will bow the head directly forwards. The clavicular portions, acting more forcibly than the sternal, give stability and steadiness to the head in sup- porting great weights. Either muscle acting singly would draw the head towards the shoulder of the same side, and carry the face towards the opposite side. The anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle is the guide for the incisions in ligature of the carotid artery. The sterno-mastoid may now be removed, by dividing it through the middle, and turning aside its ends. The upper end will be seen to be pierced by a large nerve, the spinal accessory of the eighth pair. The deep layer of fascia is then to be dissected from off the side of the larynx and trachea, towards the middle line, in order to bring into view the second group of muscles of the neck. Second Group.—Depressors of the Os Hyoides and Larynx. Sterno-hyoid, Sterno-thyroid, Thyro-hyoid, Omo-hyoid. The Sterno-liyoideus is a narrow riband-like muscle, arising from the posterior surface of the first bone of the sternum and sterno-clavicular articulation, and from the

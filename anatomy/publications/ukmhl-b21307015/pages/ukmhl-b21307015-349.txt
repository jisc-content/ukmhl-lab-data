BRONCHI. 319 TRACHEA. p 4 are the superior laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal; both branches of the pneumogastric. The two nerves com- municate with each other freely ; but the superior laryn- geal is distributed principally to the mucous membrane at the entrance of the larynx; the recurrent, to the mus- cles. In children, and in the female, the larynx is less deve- loped than in the adult male ; the thyroid cartilage forms a more obtuse angle, and is less firm : in the male the angle is acute, and the cartilages often converted into bone. The Trachea extends from opposite the fifth cervical vertebra to opposite the third dorsal, where it divides into the two bronchi. The right bronchus, larger than the left, passes off nearly at right angles, to the upper part of the corresponding lung. The left descends obliquely, and passes beneath the arch of the aorta, to reach the left lung. The Trachea is composed of Fibro-cartilaginous rings, Fibrous membrane. Mucous membrane, Muscular fibres, Glands. The Fibro-cartilaginous rings are from fifteen to twenty- in number, and extend for two-thirds around the cylinder of the trachea. They are deficient at the posterior part, where the tube is completed by fibrous membrane. The last ring has usually a triangular form in front. The rings are connected to each other by a membrane of yellow elastic fibrous tissue, which in the space between the extremities of the cartilages, posteriorly, forms a dis- tinct layer. The Muscular fibres form a thin layer, extending trans- versely between the extremities of the cartilages. On the posterior surface they are covered in by a cellule- s'0118 lamella m which are lodged the tracheal glands. These are small flattened ovoid bodies, situated in great num ti etween the fibrous and muscular layers of the membranous portion of the trachea, and also between the

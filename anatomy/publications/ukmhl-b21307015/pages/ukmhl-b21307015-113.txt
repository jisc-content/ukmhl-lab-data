POSTERIOR SCAPULAR REGION. — MUSCLES. 83 e 6 The latissimus dorsi is occasionally thrown off the in- ferior angle of the scapula, a painful and puzzling acci- dent, and not easy of reduction. The bursa too is liable to become inflamed, when a tumour of very large size may be found in this situation resulting from the disten- sion of the synovial sac. The trapezius muscle may now be removed, by cutting it away from its insertion, and turning it to the opposite side; and the latis- simus dorsi, by dividing it near to its tendon, and turning it down. Posterior Thoracic Region. — Second Layer. We thus bring into view a group of three muscles, forming the second layer of muscles of the back, which belong in their actions to the scapula : — Levator anguli scapulae, Rhomboideus minor, Rhomboideus major. The Levator anguli scapidce arises by distinct slips from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the four upper cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the upper angle and posterior border of the scapula, as far as the triangular smooth surface at the root of its spine. The Rhomboideus minor (rhombus, a parallelogram with four equal sides) is a narrow slip of muscle detached from the Rhomboideus major by a slight cellular inter- space. It arises from the spinous processes of the two last cervical vertebrae and ligamentum nuchae, and is inserted into the edge of the triangular surface on the posterior border of the scapula. The Rhomboideus major arises from the spinous pro- cesses of the four upper dorsal vertebrae and their supra- spinous ligaments, and is inserted into the posterior border of the scapula as far as its inferior angle. Posterior Scapular Region. We now proceed to examine a group of muscles, situated upon the dorsum of the scapula, the posterior scapular region: these are the Supra-spinatus, Infra-spinatus, Teres minor, Teres major.

148 , 7 - CHAPTER V. , " HEAD AND NECK. The Head may be considered as an expansion of the superior part of the vertebral column, for the reception of the brain and the principal organs of sense. The Neck is the medium of communication and con- nection between the head and the rest of the body: — communication, by means of the trachea and oesophagus, with the internal organs ; connection, by means of the muscles and vertebral column, with the superficies and osseous fabric of the trunk. The head may be divided into the cranium and face, the former being the osseous recipient of the brain, and the latter the apparatus for the development and pro- tection of the principal organs of sense. The exterior of the cranium presents but little for the study of the anatomist : the face is more varied, compre- hending — 1. The orbits for the organs of vision ; 2. The nose or external organ of smell; 3. The mouth, containing the organ of taste ; 4. The jaws or apparatus of mastica- tion ; and, immediately behind the jaws on the sides of the base of the skull, 5. the external organ of hearing. We shall commence the dissection of the head and neck, by devoting one side to the learning of the mus- cles, reserving the other for the study of the vessels and nerves. The Muscles are associated into certain natural groups, which correspond with the divisions of the head and face which we have just established : thus we find — 1. Cranial group, 2. Orbital group, 3. Nasal group, 4. Superior labial group, 5. Inferior labial group, 6. Maxillary group, 7. Auricular group.

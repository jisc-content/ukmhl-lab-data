60 SOLE OF THE FOOT. toes. It thus serves a double purpose, being mainly instrumental in preserving the convexity of the arch of the foot, while it protects from injurious pressure the soft parts between it and the bones. This fascia is divided into three portions, a middle and two lateral. The middle •portion is very dense, and is made up of strong tendinous fibres, closely interlaced with each other. It occupies the middle of the sole, and terminates towards the toes in five slips. Each of these slips is subdivided into two smaller slips, which are inserted into the sides of the base of the first phalanx of each toe, and give passage to the flexor tendons. The lateral portions are compar- atively thin. They cover the muscles on the sides, and are continuous with the deep fascia on the dorsum of the foot. At the junction of the middle with the lateral portions, two septa are sent inwards, and are attached to the under surface of the tarsal bones. These two par- titions divide the muscles into three groups, a middle and two lateral. The lateral portions of the plantar fascia are easily removed from the muscles. The middle portion must be divided through its middle, and each extremity raised separately; the anterior towards *the toes, from which it may be divided; the posterior towards the os calcis: this, however, cannot be effected without dividing many of the muscular fibres of the flexor brevis digitorum, which arise from the surface of the fascia. The muscles of the sole of the foot may be arranged in four layers : — First Layei'. Abductor pollicis, Abductor minimi digiti, Flexor brevis digitorum. Second Layer. Tendon of the flexor longus pollicis, Tendons of the flexor longus digitorum, Accessorius, Lumbricales (4). Third Layer. Flexor brevis pollicis, Adductor pollicis,

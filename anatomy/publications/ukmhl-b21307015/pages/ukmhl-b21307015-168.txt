138 RELATIONS OF THORACIC VESSELS. forwards between the aorta and pulmonary artery, and are distributed principally to the right auricle, com- municating with the anterior coronary plexus; 2. Pos- terior, more numerous, which follow the course of the right coronary artery, and form the posterior coronary plexus. The branches of this plexus are distributed to the left auricle and posterior surface of the ventricle. Besides those to the heart, numerous branches are sent from the cardiac plexuses to the pulmonary plexuses, particularly to the anterior. When these nerves have been examined, the student should apply himself to observe the relations of the large vessels and tubes at the upper part of the thorax. He will find the left vena innominata the most superficial, lying obliquely across the three branches of the arch of the aorta, as it descends to form the superior cava with the vena innominata of the right side. It receives the superior intercostal and inferior thyroid veins. The vessels at the upper part of the thorax may be thus arranged in their order from before backwards: â€” Left vena innominata, Right vena innominata, Arteria innominata, Left carotid, Trachea, (Esophagus, Left subclavian artery, Thoracic duct. Having completed the study of the thorax, the student should now continue his dissection of the upper ex- tremity, page 75.

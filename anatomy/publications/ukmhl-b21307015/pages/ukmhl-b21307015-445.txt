FEMALE PERINEUM. 4-15 Lower fasciculus of the compressor urethrae muscle, Posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia, A few fibres of the levator ani, Prostate gland, Neck of the bladder. Perineum in the Female. The structures in the female perineum are the same as in the male, but somewhat modified to suit the dif- ference of form in the organs of generation. The in- tegument and superficial fascia are thrown into folds, called labia, to prepare for the enormous distension to which this part is submitted in parturition. The entrance of the vagina is encircled by a sphincter, which is not unlike the accelerator urinae of the male. The clitoris is the penis of the female, composed of its two corpora cavernosa, and therefore provided with erectores clitoridis analogous to the erectores penis. The transversus perinei, sphincters, and levator ani, are precisely the same as in the male. The Muscles of the female perineum are the Constrictor vaginae, Transversus perinei, Erector clitoridis, Compressor urethrae, Sphincter ani. The Constrictor vagince is analogous to the accelerator urinae of the male: it arises from the tendinous centre of the perineum, where it is continuous with the sphincter ani, and passes forwards on each side of the entrance of the vagina, to be inserted into the ramus of the pubis and corpus cavernosum clitoridis. The Transversus perinei is a small muscle arising on each side from the ramus of the ischium, and inserted into the side of the constrictor vaginae. The Erector clitoridis arises from the ramus of the -schium, and is inserted on each side into the crus cli- oridis. The Compressor urethrae has the same origins and in- ertions, and exercises the same functions in the female -.s in the male. t 4<

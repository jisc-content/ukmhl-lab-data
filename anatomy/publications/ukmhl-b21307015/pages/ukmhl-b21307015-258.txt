r 228 PREVERTEBRAL REGION. The two next muscles are brought into view by raising the mucous membrane from off the pillars of the soft palate at each side. The Palato-glossus (constrictor isthmi faucium) is a small fasciculus of fibres that arises in the soft palate, and descends to be inserted into the side of the tongue. It is the projection of this small muscle that forms the anterior pillar of the soft palate. It has been named constrictor isthmi faucium from a function it performs in common with the palato-pharyngeus, viz. of constricting the open- ing of the fauces. The Palato-pliaryngeus forms the posterior pillar (Jig. 23. 6. 6.) of the fauces; it arises from the soft palate, and is inserted into the muscular structure of the pha- rynx. Actions.â€” The azygos uvulae shortens the uvula. The levator palati raises the soft palate, while the tensor spreads it out laterally so as to form a septum between the pharynx and posterior nares during deglutition. The palato-glossus and pharyngeus constrict the opening of the fauces, and press the food from the dorsum of the tongue into the pharynx. The larynx is described in Chap. VII., on the organs of sense. Prevertehral Region. The remaining region of the neck is the prevertebral, which is provided with a group of five muscles. They have been already exposed by the removal of the pharynx; they are the Rectus anticus major, Rectus anticus minor, Scalenus anticus, Scalenus posticus, Longus colli. The Rectus anticus major arises from the anterior tuber- cles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone. The Rectus anticus minor arises from the anterior border of the atlas, and is inserted into the basilar process.

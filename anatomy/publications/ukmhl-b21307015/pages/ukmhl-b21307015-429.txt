399 UTERUS. STRUCTURE. side of the uterus are the broad ligaments, 6. They con- tain several important parts. The Cei'vix, 3., gives attachment to the vagina, and the os uteri, 2., projects into the upper part of the vagina, and presents a transverse opening. Within and around the os uteri are occasionally found some small vesicles, which are called the ovula of Naboth. These are dilated mucous follicles, having the openings closed by adhesion. The posterior lip of the os uteri is thicker and more projecting than the anterior. The Cavity of the uterus is triangular in its form, the upper angles corresponding with the commencement of the Fallopian tubes. In the cervix of the organ is an arborescent arrangement of folds, which is called arbor vita; uterina. Structure. — The uterus has three coats — an in- ternal, or mucous, a fibrous, or muscular, and a peritoneal coat. In the unimpregnated state the fibrous structure is dense and pale, and very indistinct; but in the impreg- * Fig. 47. The female internal organs of generation. No. 1.

EYE. â€” TUNICS. 280 curve into the posterior part of the mouth ; the thread bearing the sponge is passed through the eye of the spring, and the instrument with the thread is withdrawn through the nose. The sponge is then carefully directed beneath the soft palate, and drawn gently against the posterior openings of the nose. Growths of various kinds (polypi) proceed from the mucous membrane, and increase to a great size, impeding nasal respiration, forcing the bones out of their places, and doing great mischief. They are generally attached by a narrow pedicle, and may be removed with the polypus forceps. In performing this operation, the direction of the meatuses must be recollected, otherwise there would be danger of entangling the instrument, and pulling away one of the spongy bones. When the tube of the stomach-pump cannot be passed through the mouth, it may be introduced into that viscus by passing it along the inferior meatus of the nose. Patients, with extensive injury to the jaws, have been nourished for a long time solely by liquid food poured into the stomach in this way. In obstruction of the nasal duct, it is often of great consequence to introduce a probe into it from the inferior meatus. This operation should therefore be practised upon the subject. The Eye, with its Appendages. The form of the eyeball is that of a sphere, having a segment of a smaller sphere ingrafted upon its anterior surface, which increases its antero-posterior diameter. The axes of the two eyeballs are parallel with each other, and do not correspond with the axes of the orbits, which are directed outwards. The optic nerves follow the direction of the orbits, and therefore enter the eyeballs to their nasal side. The Globe of the eye is composed of tunics and humours. The tunics are three in number, the ]. Sclerotic and cornea, 2. Choroid, iris, and ciliary processes, 3. Retina and zonula ciliaris.

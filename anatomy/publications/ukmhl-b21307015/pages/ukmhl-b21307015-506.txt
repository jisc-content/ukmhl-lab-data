476 TARSO-METATARSAL LIGAMENTS. caneo-astragaloid interosseous ligament, must be rup- tured. 2. Dislocation of the five anterior bones of the tarsus from the astragalus and os calcis. 3. Dislocation of the internal cuneiform bone. 6. Tarso-metatarsal articulation. — The ligaments of this articulation are, Dorsal, Plantar, Interosseous. The Dorsal ligaments connect the metatarsal to the tar- sal bones, and the metatarsal bones with each other. The Plantar ligaments have the same disposition on the plantar surface. The Interosseous ligaments are situated between the metatarsal bones of the four lesser toes, and also be- tween the base of the second metatarsal bone, and the internal and external cuneiform bones. The metatarsal bone of the great toe has a distinct synovial membrane. The metatarsal bone of the second toe is implanted by its base between the internal and external cuneiform bones. This disposition must be recollected in ampu- tation at the tarso-metatarsal articulation. Dislocations. — These bones are not dislocated, ex- cept by extreme violence^ 7. Metatarso-phalangeal articulation. — The ligaments of this articulation, like those of the articulation between the first phalanges and metacarpal bones of the hand, are,— Anterior or plantar, Two lateral, Transverse. The Anterior or plantar ligaments are thick and fibro- cartilaginous, and form part of the articulating surface of the joint. The Lateral ligaments are short and very strong, and situated on each side of the joints. The Transverse ligaments are strong bands, which pass transversely between the anterior ligaments.

412 LAYERS OF THE PERINEUM. above description, as appearing to us the more consistent with the general connections of the muscle, and with its actions. The internal pudic artery {fig. 48.12.) lies behind the transverse portion of the muscle at each side, near its at- tachment to the ischium. The artery of the bulb, 13., is given off from the pudic above the transverse portion, and passes inwards in front of the muscle, to enter the posterior part of the bulb. Actions. — Taking its fixed point from the ramus of the ischium at each side, “ it can,” says Mr. Guthrie, “ compress the urethra so as to close it; I conceive com- pletely, after the manner of a sphincter.” The transverse portion will also have a tendency to draw the urethra downwards, whilst the perpendicular portion will draw it upwards towards the pubis. The inferior fasciculus of the transverse muscle, enclosing Cowper’s glands, will assist them in evacuating their secretion. Coivpers * glands {fig. 48.11 .fig. 45. 16.) are two small clusters of mucous follicles, which pour their secretion by two slender ducts into the bulbous portion of the ure- thral canal. They are enclosed by the fibres of the com- pressor urethrae muscle, by which they are assisted in the excretion of their proper fluid. The rest of the anatomy of this region belongs to the viscera of the pelvis. The summary of the structures in the perineum may be thus expressed in a tabular form.

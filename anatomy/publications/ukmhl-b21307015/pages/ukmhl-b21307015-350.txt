320 THYROID GLAND. two layers of elastic fibrous tissue connecting the rings. They pour their secretion upon the mucous membrane. Thyroid Gland. The Thyroid gland consists of two lobes, which are situated one on each side of the trachea, and are con- nected with each other by means of an isthmus, which crosses its upper rings. There is considerable variety in the situation and breadth of this isthmus; which should be recollected in the performance of operations upon the trachea. The gland is larger in young subjects, and in females, than in the adult and males. It is the seat of an enlargement called bronchocele, goitre, or the Derby- shire neck. A muscle is occasionally found connected with its upper border or with its isthmus, and attached, superiorly, to the body of the os hyoides. It was named by Soemmering the “ Levator glandules thyroidece.” Vessels and Nerves. — It is abundantly supplied with blood by the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. Some- times an additional artery is derived from the arteria innominata, and ascends upon the front of the trachea to be distributed to the gland. The wound of this vessel in tracheotomy, might be fatal to the patient. The Nerves are derived from the superior laryngeal and sympathetic.

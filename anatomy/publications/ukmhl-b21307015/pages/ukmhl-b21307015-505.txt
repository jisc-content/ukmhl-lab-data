475 PLANTAR LIGAMENTS. ii the plantar surface of the foot; three of them, however, are of large size and have especial names, viz. the Calcaneo-scaphoid, Long calcaneo-cuboid, Short calcaneo-cuboid. The Calcaneo-scaplioid ligament is a broad and dense band of ligament which passes forwards, from the anterior border of the os calcis to the edge of the scaphoid bone. In addition to connecting the os calcis and scaphoid bone, it supports the astragalus, and forms part of the cavity in which its rounded head is received. It is lined upon its upper surface with the synovial membrane of the astra- galo-scaphoid articulation. The Long calcaneo-cuboid, or ligamentum longumplantce, is a long band of ligamentous fibres, which proceeds from the under surface of the os calcis to the rough surface on the under surface of the cuboid bone, its fibres being con- tinued onwards to the bases of the third and fourth meta- tarsal bones. It forms the inferior boundary of a canal in the cuboid bone, through which the tendon of the peroneus longus passes to its insertion into the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The Short calcaneo-cuboid, or ligamentum, breve plantce, is situated beneath the long plantar ligament; it is broad and extensive, and ties the under surfaces of the os calcis and cuboid bones firmly together. The Interosseous ligaments are short and strong liga- mentous fibres situated between the adjoining bones, and attached to all their rough surfaces. One of these, the Calcaneo-astragcdoid, is lodged in the groove upon the upper surface of the os calcis, and the lower of the astra- galus. It is large and very strong, and serves to unite the calcis and astragalus solidly together. The Os calcis articulates with two bones ; the external cuneiform with six ; and the five other bones of the tarsus with four each.

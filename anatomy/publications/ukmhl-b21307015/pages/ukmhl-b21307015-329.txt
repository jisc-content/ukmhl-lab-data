299 MUSCLES OF THE TYMPANUM. very close resemblance. Its head articulates with the os orbiculare, and the two branches are connected at its extremity by a flat oval-shaped plate, representing the foot of the stirrup, which fits accurately the opening from the tympanum into the vestibule, the fenestra ovalis. The neck of the stapes gives attachment to the stapedius muscle. The Muscles of the tympanum are also four, the Tensor tympani, Laxator tympani, Laxator tympani minor, Stapedius. To these Mr. Tod has added five others, the posterior mallei, superior capitis mallei, obliquus incudis externus posterior, triangularis incudis, and musculus, or structural stapedius inferior; for the history of which we must refer the lover of minute anatomy to the work previously quoted. The Tensor tympani arises from the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and from the Eustachian tube, and passes forwards in a distinct canal separated from the tube by the processus cochleariformis, to be inserted into the short process of the malleus. The Laxator tympani arises from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, and passes through an opening in the fissura Glaseri, to be inserted into the long process of ; the malleus. The Laxator tympani minor arises from the upper margin of the meatus, and is inserted into the handle of the malleus. The Stapedius arises from the interior of the pyramid, and escapes from its summit to be inserted into the neck of the stapes. The openings in the tympanum are ten in number, five large and five small; they are the Laige openings. Small openings.

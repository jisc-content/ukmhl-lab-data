196 NERVES OF THE NECK. The operation for ligature of the subclavian artery has been already described. This operation can only be per- formed in the third part of its course. The first part lies too deeply, is surrounded with important relations, and is giving off the five branches; and the second lies behind the scalenus anticus muscle. The third part of the artery is, however, comparatively super- ficial, and the operation may be performed upon it with perfect security. Nerves of the Neck. Having now considered all the vessels of the neck, we must next turn our attention to the nerves which occupy this region ; they are the eighth and ninth pairs of cere- bral, the sympathetic, and the eight cervical nerves. The Eighth pair (yf^.19.) of cerebral nerves consists of the glosso-pharyngeal, 6.,pneu- mogastric or vagus, 10., and spinal accessory, 21. They arise from the respiratory tract of Bell, the two former, 5. 8., between the corpus olivare and restiforme; the latter, 20., from the spinal cord, opposite the fourth cervical vertebra: hence its cognomen, spinal. The spinal accessory ascends from its origin between the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves, to join the # Fig. 19.

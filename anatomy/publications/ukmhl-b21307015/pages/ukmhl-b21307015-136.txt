106 POSTERIOR REGION OF THE FORE-ARM. The Extensor minimi digiti (auricularis) is an off-set from the extensor communis. It as- sists in forming the tendinous expansion on the back of the little finger, and is inserted into the two last phalanges. It is to this muscle that the little finger owes its power of separate ex- tension, and from being called into action when the point of the finger is introduced into the meatus of the ear for the pur- pose of removing unpleasant sensations, or producing titilla- tion: the muscle was called by the older writers “ auricularis.” The Extensor carpi ulnaris arises from the external condyle and the upper two thirds of the border of the ulna. Its tendon passes through the posterior groove in the ulna, to be inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. The Anconeus arises from the outer condyle, and is inserted into the olecranon and triangular surface on the upper extremity of the ulna. When these muscles have been examined, the extensor communis digitorum and extensor minimi digiti should be removed, and the extensor carpi ulnaris drawn aside, to * Fig. 9.

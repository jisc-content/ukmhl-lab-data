The mediastinum is divided into the anterior, middle, and posterior. The Anterior mediastinum (Jig. 11. 6.) is a triangular space, bounded in front by the sternum, and on either side by the pleura. It contains a quantity of loose cellular tissue, in which are found some lymphatic glands and vessels passing upwards from the liver ; the remains of the thymus gland, the origins of the sterno-hyoid, and sterno- thyroid muscles, and the internal mammary vessels. * Fig. 11.

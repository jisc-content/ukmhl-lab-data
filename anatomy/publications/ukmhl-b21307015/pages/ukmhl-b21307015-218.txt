188 INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. The Internal carotid artery ascends perpendicu- larly from its bifurcation, opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, to the carotid foramen in the petrous bone. It then curves inwards along the carotid canal, passes forwards by the side of the sella turcica, and at the anterior clinoid process pierces the dura mater and divides into three branches. Its course is naturally divided into four portions : — 1. Cervical, situated in the neck; 2. Petrous, occupying the carotid canal; 3. Cavernous, lying by the side of the sella turcica; and 4?. Cerebral, after it has pierced the dura mater. Relations. — The cervical portion rests upon the rectus anticus major, and superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and partly on the internal jugular vein, lingual and pneumogastric nerves. It is crossed behind by the pharyngeal and superior laryngeal nerves. To its inner side it has the pharynx, tonsil, and ascending pharyngeal artery ; to its outer side the jugular vein, commencement of the eighth pair, and lingual nerve. And it is crossed in front by the stylo glossus and stylo- pharyngeus muscles, and glosso-pharyngeal nerve, being covered in by the parotid gland.

387 SACRAL PLEXUS. BRANCHES. s 2 two layers of the deep perineal fascia, giving off branches to the perineum and penis, and terminates in the dorsalis penis artery. Its branches within the pelvis are the middle hemorrhoidal. In the female it is distributed in the same manner to the perineum and external organs of generation. The Ilio-lumbar artery ascends beneath the psoas mus- cle to the posterior part of the crest of the ilium, along which it takes its course, supplying the adjoining muscles. It inosculates with the lumbar arteries and with the cir- cumflexa ilii. The Obturator artery passes forwards a little below the brim of the pelvis, to the upper border of the obturator foramen. It enters the thigh through an opening in the obturator ligament, and is distributed to the muscles of the upper and inner part of the thigh, and to the hip joint: see page 24. The Lateral sacral is a small artery which runs by the side of the anterior sacral foramina, and sends branches into them for the supply of the sacral nerves. It anas- tomoses with the sacra-media. The Gluteal artery passes directly outwards through the upper part of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, above the pyriformis muscle, and is distributed to the gluteal muscles : see page 35. Sacral plexus of nerves The Sacral plexus is formed by the anterior branches of the last lumbar and four upper sacral nerves, and receives filaments from the sympathetic ganglia. The last lumbar nerve is called lum- bosacral; it gives origin to the gluteal nei've. The Branches of the sacral plexus are, the visceral, which are distributed to the viscera of the pelvis, viz., the bladder, prostate gland, uterus, rectum, &c., and commu- nicate very freely with the termination of the hypogastric plexus ; and the external, which are three in number. Internal pudic, Lesser ischiatic, Greater ischiatic. The Gluteal nerve passes out of the pelvis with the jluteal artery, through the great sacro-ischiatic foramen,

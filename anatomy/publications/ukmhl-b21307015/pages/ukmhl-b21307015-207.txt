COMMON CAROTID ARTERY. 177 nerve ; and in front the sterno-thyroid, sterno-mastoid, omo-hyoid and platysma muscles, and the descendens noni nerve. The Left carotid (Jig. 17. 9.) is smaller than the right, and more deeply seated. In addition to the relations just enumerated, which are common to both, it is crossed near its commencement by the left vena innominata; lies upon the trachea; then gets to its side, and is in relation with the oesophagus and thoracic duct: to facilitate the study of these relations, we have arranged them in a In Front.

453 COSTO-VERTEBRAL ARTICULATION. lined by a synovial membrane ; hence the two synovial membranes. Besides the lower jaw, there are several other joints provided with a complete inter-articular fibro-cartilage, and, consequently, with two synovial membranes : they are, th e stemo-clavicular articulation, the acromio-clavicular, and the articulation of the ulna with the cuneiform bone. The inter-articular fibro-cartilages of the knee-joint are partial, and there is but one synovial membrane. The articulations of the heads of the ribs with the vertebrae have two synovial membranes, separated by an inter-articular ligament without fibro-cartilage. Dislocations. — The dislocations of the lower jaw are three — 1. Complete; 2. Partial; and, 3. Subluxation. In Complete dislocation, both condyles are thrown for- wards into the zigomatic fossae. In Partial dislocation, one condyle is thrown forwards into the zigomatic fossa. In Subluxation, the condyle is displaced from its inter- articular fibro-cartilage. 6. Articulation of the ribs with the vertebrce.— The ligaments of these articulations are divisible into two groups— 1st, those connecting the head of the rib with the vertebrce ; and, 2d, those connecting the neck and tubercle of the rib with the transverse processes. They are, 1st Group. Anterior costo-vertebral, or stellate, Capsular, Inter-articular ligament, Two synovial membranes. 2d Group. Anterior costo-transverse. Middle costo-transverse, Posterior costo-transverse. The Anterior costo-vertebral or stellate ligament consists of three short bands of ligamentous fibres that radiate from the anterior part of the head of the rib. The superior band passes upwards and is attached to the vertebra above;

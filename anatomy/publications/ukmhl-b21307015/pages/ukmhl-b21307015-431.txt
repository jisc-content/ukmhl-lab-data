CORPUS LUTEUM. ROUND LIGAMENTS. 401 upper angles of the uterus at each side by a rounded cord, the ligament of the ovary. The Structure of the ovary is a spongy vascular tissue, containing serous vesicles ( Graafian), and enclosed in a dense, fibrous tissue, covered by peritoneum. These vesicles are simple cysts containing a limpid fluid, of various size,, and from ten to fifteen in number in each ovary. They are the ova in which the future embryo is developed. Bauer states, that the vesicles which are nearest the surface have a minute floating body in their interior, which is the rudiment of the germ. After conception, a yellow spot is often found in one or both ovaries, and has been named the corpus luteum. It is formed of yellow, condensed substance, deposited in the place of the ovum, which has escaped. This was formerly considered a certain evidence of conception having taken place ; but nothing can be more fallacious. It does not always exist in women who have borne children, and it has been found in virgins, and even in a child five years of age. Vessels and Nerves.â€” The Arteries of the ovaries are the spermatic. Its Nerves are derived from the spermatic plexus. The uterus is held in its place by two round ligaments, which are connected with the angles of the uterus, and pass forwards beneath the peritoneum to the internal abdominal ring: they then follow the course of the spermatic canal on each side to the labia majora. While in the spermatic canal, they have the same relations as the spermatic cord, which they represent in the female. They are accompanied by a small artery, and several filaments of the spermatic plexus of nerves.

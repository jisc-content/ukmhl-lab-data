57 POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. D 5 the interosseous membrane, between the two bones of the leg. It arises by two beads from the adjacent sides of the tibia and fibula their whole length, and from the inter- osseous membrane. Its tendon passes inwards beneath the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, and runs in the same sheath, but internal to it, into the sole of the foot, to be inserted into the tuberosity of the scaphoid and internal cuneiform bone. The student will observe that the two latter muscles change their relative position to each other in their course. Thus, in the leg, the position of the three muscles from within outwards, is flexor longus digitorum, tibialis posticus, flexor longus pollicis. At the inner malleolus, the relation of the tendons is tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, both in the same sheath ; then a broad groove, which lodges the posterior tibial artery, venae comites, and nerve; and lastly, the flexor longus pollicis. The arteries of the posterior tibial region are, — , f anterior peroneal, * ‘ \ posterior peroneal, muscular. Posterior tibial The Posterior tibial artery runs down the tibial side of the leg, from the lower border of the popliteus muscle to the inner ankle. Relations. — It rests, 1st. upon the tibialis posticus ; 2dly, upon the flexor longus digitorum; Sdly, upon the tibia, and is covered in by the intermuscular fascia.

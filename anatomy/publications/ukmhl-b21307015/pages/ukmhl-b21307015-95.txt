65 AND ACTIONS OT MUSCLES. trunk is the fixed point from which arise the muscles that move the thigh. The articulation of the hip is an uni- versal joint; hence the movements are very numerous, but they may all be referred to the four primary direc- tions, foriuctrds, backwards, inwards, outwards, to which is added rotation on its axis. The articulation of the femur with the tibia is a hinge joint, and is therefore applicable only to flexion and ex- tension: the muscles performing these actions, arise from the pelvis and femur. But as we descend, we find the length of the bones diminishing while their numbers in- crease. The foot is a compound organ made up of a num- ber of parts, each part performing distinct movements. We are therefore prepared to find a number of muscles destined to supply these demands. But numerous as they really are, they may, by a careful analysis, be arranged and grouped under a few simple actions. The movements of the tarsus may be referred to four heads,flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, the two latter actions being very imperfect. The muscles performing these movements are the following : — Flexion. Extension. Tibialis anticus, Tibialis posticus, Peroneus tertius. Peroneus longus, brevis, and where forcible action is required as in walking, Gastrocnemius, Plantaris, Soleus. Adduction. Abduction. Tibialis anticus, Peroneus longus, posticus. «— brevis. The movements of the toes may in the same manner be reduced to precisely the same simplicity of action thus : — Flexion. Extension. Flexor longus digitorum, Extensor longus digitorum. brevis digitorum, ,— brevis digitorum. ‘ accessorius, minimi digiti.

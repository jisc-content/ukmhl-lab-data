441 STRUCTURE. VESSELS AND NERVES. U 5 the cellular capsule and vessels, and dissecting away the reticulated cellular tissue, which retains the lobules in contact, the reservoir, from being folded in a serpentine manner upon itself, admits of being drawn out into a length- ened tubular corcl*, around which the lobules are clus- tered in a spiral manner, and resemble knots upon a cord, or a string of beads. The reservoir, pouches, and cells, contain a white fluid “ like chyle,” or ‘Mike cream, but with a small admix- ture of red globules.” In the human foetus this fluid has been found by Sir Astley in too small proportion to be submitted to chemical analysis. But the thymic fluid of the foetal calf, which exists in great abundance, gave the following analytical f results : — one hundred parts of the fluid contained sixteen parts of solid matter, which con- sisted of, ' i| Incipient fibrine, Albumen, Mucus, and muco-extractive matter, Muriate and phosphate of potass, Phosphate of soda, Phosphoric acid, a trace. The Arteries of the thymus gland are derived from the internal mammary, and from the superior and inferior thyroid. The Veins terminate in the left vena innominata, and some small branches in the thyroid veins. The Nerves are very minute, and are derived chiefly through the internal mammary plexus, from the superior thoracic ganglion of the sympathetic. Sir Astley Cooper has also seen a branch from the junction of the pneumo- gastric and sympathetic pass to the side of the gland. The Lymphatics terminate in the general union of the lymphatic vessels at the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian veins. Sir Astley Cooper has injected them only once in the human foetus, but in the calf be finds two large lymphatic ducts, which commence in the upper extremities of the glands, and pass downwards to • See the beautiful plates in Sir Astley Cooper’s work, t This analysis was conducted by Dr. Dowlor of Richmond.

PELVIO-VERTEBRAL ARTICULATION. 455 This articulation is provided with a synovial mem- brane. The sixth, seventh, and eighth, and sometimes the fifth and ninth costal cartilages, have articulations with each other, and a perfect synovial capsule. They are con- nected by ligamentous fibres which pass from one car- tilage to the other external and internal ligaments. The ninth and tenth are connected at their extremities by ligamentous fibres, but have no synovial membranes. 8 Articulation of the vertebral column with the pelvis. — The last lumbar vertebra is connected with the sacrum by the same ligaments with which the various vertebrae are connected with each other ; viz., the anterior and pos- terior common ligaments, inter-vertebral substance, liga- menta subflava, capsular ligaments, and inter and supra- spinous ligaments. There are only two proper ligaments connecting the vertebral column with the pelvis ; they are, the Lumbo-sacral, Lumbo-iliac. I The Lumbo-sacral ligament is a thick triangular fas- ciculus of ligamentous fibres, connected above with the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra, and below with the upper border of the sacrum. The Lumbo-iliac ligament passes from the apex of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra to the pos- terior part of the crest of the ilium. 9. The Articulations of the pelvis. — The ligaments be- longing to the articulations of the pelvis are divisible into four groups—1st., those connecting the sacrum and ilium ; 2d., those passing between the sacrum and ischium ; 3rd, between the sacrum and coccyx; and 4th., between the two pubic bones. 1st. Between the Sacrum and Ilium. Sacro-iliac anterior, Sacro-iliac posterior, Sacro-iliac interosseous. 2d. Bctiveen the Sacrum and Ischium. Sacro-ischiatic anterior {short). Sacro-ischiatic posterior {long).

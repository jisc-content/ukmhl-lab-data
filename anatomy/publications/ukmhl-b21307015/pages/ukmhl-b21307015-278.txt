248 HIPPOCAMPUS MAJOR. spoken of as the contents of the middle cornu: these are the Hippocampus major, Pes hippocampi, Pes accessorius, Corpus fimbriatum, Choroid plexus, Fascia dentata, Transverse fissure. The Hippocampus major or cornu Ammonis, so called from its resemblance to a ram’s horn, the famous crest of Jupiter Ammon, is a considerable projection from the in- ferior wall, and extends the whole length of the middle cornu. Its extremity is likened to the clubfoot of some animal, from its presenting a number of knuckle-like ele- vations upon the surface : hence it is named pes hippo~ campi. The hippocampus major is the termination of the lateral edge of the hemisphere, which in this situation is very much attenuated and rolled upon itself. If it be cut across, it will be seen to resemble the extremity of a convoluted scroll, consisting of alternate layers of white and grey substance. The hippocampus major is continuous supe- riorly with the fornix and corpus callosum. The Pes accessorius is a swelling somewhat resembling the hippocampus major’, but smaller in size: it is situated on the outer wall of the cornu, and is frequently absent. The Corpus fimbriatum is the narrow white band which is prolonged from the central cavity of the ventricle, and is attached along the inner border of the hippocampus major to its termination. Fascia dentata.—If the corpus fimbriatum be carefully raised a narrow serrated band of grey substance will be seen beneath it: this is the fascia dentata. Beneath the corpus fimbriatum will be likewise seen the transverse fissure of the brain, which has been before de cribed as stretching from the fissure of Sylvius on one side, across to the same fissure on the opposite side of the brain. It is through this fissure that the pia mater com- municates with the choroid plexus, and the latter obtains its supply of blood. The fissure is bounded on one side

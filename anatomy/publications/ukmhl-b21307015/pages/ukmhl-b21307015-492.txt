RADIO-ULNAR LIGAMENTS. 462 In the two latter dislocations the annular ligament of the head of the radius is ruptured. 6. The Radio-ulnar articulation.â€”The radius and ulna are firmly held together by ligaments which are connected with both extremities of the bones, and with the shaft; they are, the Annular, Oblique, Interosseous, Anterior inferior, Posterior inferior, Interarticular fibro-cartilage. The Annular ligament (orbicular, coronary') is a firm band that surrounds the head of the radius, and is attached by each end to the extremities of the lesser sigmoid cavity. It is lined on its inner surface by the synovial membrane of the shoulder joint, and gives attachment to the external lateral ligament of that articulation. The rupture of this ligament permits of the dislocation of the head of the radius. The Oblique ligament is a narrow slip of ligamentous fibres, descending obliquely from the base of the coronoid process of the ulna, to the side of the radius. The Interosseous ligament is a broad and thin plane of ligamentous fibres passing obliquely from the sharp ridge on the radius to that on the ulna. It is perforated at its lower part for the passage of the anterior interosseous artery. The Anterior inferior ligament is a thin fasciculus of fibres passing transversely between the radius and ulna. The Posterior inferior ligament is also thin and loose, and has the same disposition on the posterior surface of the articulation. The Interarticular or triangular fibro-cartilage acts the part of a ligament between the lower extremities of the radius and ulna. It is attached by its apex to the inner surface of the styloid process of the ulna, and by its base to the edge of the radius. This fibro-cartilage is lined upon its upper surface by a synovial membrane, which forms a duph-

LIGAMENTS. VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 448 the bones. The anterior and posterior are thin and loose in order to permit of the required extent of movement. 3. Enarthrosis (ev, in ; apOpucru;) is the most extensive in its range of motion of all the moveable joints. From the manner of connection and form of the bones in this articulation, it is called the ball and socket joint. There are three instances in the body, viz. the hip, the shoulder, and the articulation of the metacarpal bone of the thumb with the trapezium. The ball and socket joint has a circular form, and, in place of the four distinct ligaments of the ginglymus, is enclosed in a bag of ligamentous fibres, called a capsular ligament. The Joints may, for the convenience of the student, be divided into those of the trunk; those of the upper ex- tremity; and those of the loiver extremity. Ligaments of the Trunk. The Ligaments of the trunk will be considered and described in the following order : — 1. Of the Vertebral column. 2. Of the Atlas, with the Occipital bone. 3. Of the Axis, with the Occipital bone. 4. Of the Atlas, with the Axis. 5. Of the Lower jaw. 6. Of the Ribs, with the Vertebrae. 7. Of the Ribs, with the Sternum, and with each other. 8. Of the Vertebral column, with the Pelvis. 9. Of the Pelvis. 7 1. Articulation of the vertebral column. — The vertebra; are divided into — body, arches, articular, spinous, and transverse processes ; and their ligaments admit of pre- cisely the same arrangement. The ligaments of the bodies are the Anterior common ligament, Posterior common ligament. Of the arches, Ligamenta subflava.

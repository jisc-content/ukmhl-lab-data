464 LIGAMENTS OF THE CARPUS. 8. Articulation betiveen the Carpal bones. — The liga- ments connecting together the different bones of the carpus, are, the Dorsal, Palmar, Interosseous, Anterior annular. The Dorsal ligaments are ligamentous bands that pass from bone to bone in every direction, upon the dorsal surface of the carpus. The Palmar ligaments are fasciculi of the same kind, and having the same disposition upon the palmar surface. The Interosseous ligaments are situated between the ad- joining bones in each rank: in the upper rank they close the upper part of the spaces between the scaphoid, semi- lunar, and cuneiform bones; in the lower rank they leave spaces through which the synovial membrane is continued to the metacarpal bones. The Anterior annular ligament is a firm ligamentous band which connects the bones of the two sides of the carpus. It is attached by one extremity to the trapezium and scaphoid, and by the other to the unciform process of the unciform and the base of the pisiform bone, and forms an arch over the anterior surface of the carpus, be- neath which the tendons of the long flexors and median nerve pass into the palm of the hand. The Articulation of the pisiform bone with the cunei- form, is provided with a distinct synovial membrane, which is protected by ligamentous fibres which form a kind of capsule around the joint. Synovial membranes. — There are five synovial mem- branes entering into the composition of the articulations of the carpus : — 1. The first is situated between the lower end of the ulnar and the interarticular fibro-cartilage; it is called sacciform, from forming a sacculus between the lateral articulation of the ulna with the radius. 2. The second is situated between the lower surface of the radius and interarticular fibro-cartilage above, and the first rank of bones of the carpus below. 3. The third is the most extensive of the synovial

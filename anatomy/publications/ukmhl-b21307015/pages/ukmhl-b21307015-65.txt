The gluteal artery and nerve {fig. 4-. 11.) are found immediately above the py- riformis muscle; the other vessels and nerves, 12. 14., immediately beneath that muscle. The Gluteal artery is a branch of the internal iliac; it passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro- ischiatic foramen, above tbe pyriformis muscle, and im- mediately divides into three branches. 1st. A superficial branch, directed backwards, and distributed to the glu- teus maximus. 2. A deep st^morbranch,which passes along the superior curved line of the dorsum of the ilium, between the gluteus * Fig. 4.

PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE. 198 The Tympanic is a remarkable branch described by Jacobson, and hence called Jacobson's nerve. It arises from the ganglion of Andersch, and passes through a small canal in the petrous bone to tbe internal wall of the tympanum, where it divides into six branches, which are thus distributed : â€” 1. To the fenestra rotunda, 2. To the fenestra ovalis, 3. To the Eustachian tube, 4. To the carotid plexus, 5. To the cranial branch of the Vidian, 6. To the otic ganglion. These filaments are extremely small, and cannot be seen in the adult tympanum, unless by a lucky section. They are best dissected in the ear of the foetus. In the cat they are very distinct and easily demonstrated. The Muscular branch divides into filaments, which are distributed to the stylo-pharyngeus and to the posterior belly of the digastricus and stylo-hyoideus muscle. The Pharyngeal branches, 7., are two or three fila- ments sent to the side of the pharynx and pharyngeal plexus. The Pneumogastric nerve (vagus) forms a short rounded ganglion (fig. 19. 9.) as it passes through the foramen lacerum posterius. Having escaped at this open- ing, it presents a second gangliform swelling, io., nearly an inch in length, and surrounded by an irregular plexus of white nerves, which communicate with each other, with the other divisions of the eighth pair, and with the trunk of the pneumogastric below the ganglion. This second, or plexiform ganglion (ganglion of the superior laryngeal branch of Sir Astley Cooper), is situated, at first, behind the internal carotid artery, and then between that vessel and the internal jugular vein. The pneumo- gastric nerve then descends the neck within the sheath of the carotid vessels, lying behind and between the artery and vein to the root of the neck. Here the course of the nerve at opposite sides becomes different. The right passes between the subclavian artery and vein to the posterior mediastinum, then behind the root

201 LINGUAL NERVES. k 5 aorta, it gives branches {fig. 19. 16.) to the heart and root of the lungs ; and, as it ascends the neck, it gives branches to the oesophagus and trachea, and communicates with the external laryngeal nerve and sympathetic. In function it is the proper motor nerve of the larynx. The remaining branches of the pneumogastric have been described with the anatomy of the thorax, page 136. The Spinal accessory nerve, on escaping from the foramen lacerum posterius, passes backwards behind the internal jugular vein, and descends obliquely to the upper part of the sterno-mastoid muscle, which it pierces {fig. 19. 21.). It then passes obliquely across the side of the neck to the trapezius muscle, to which it is distributed, 22. It communicates, like the preceding nerves, with the other branches of the eighth pair, and with the sym- pathetic. Its branches supply the sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscles. The Lingual nerve (ninth, hypo-glossal), the true motor nerve of the tongue, arises by several filaments from the side of the corpus pyramidale of the medulla oblongata, and escapes from the skull through the ante- rior condyloid foramen. It then passes forwards behind the internal jugular vein, and descends along its outer border to a point parallel with the angle of the lower jaw. It next curves inwards around the occipital artery, with which it forms a loop, and crosses the lower part of the hyo-glossus muscle to the genio-hyo-glossus, in which it terminates. It is distributed to the muscles of the tongue, and principally to the genio-hyo-glossus. It is separated from the lingual artery by the hyo-glossus muscle, and, while resting on this muscle, presents a flattened appearance. The Branches of the lingual nerve are, â€” Communicating branches with the Pneumogastric, Sympathetic. Descendens noni, Hyoidean branch, Communicating filaments with the Gustatory nerve.

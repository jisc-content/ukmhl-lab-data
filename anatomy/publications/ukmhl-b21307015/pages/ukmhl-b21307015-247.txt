217 SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. the dura mater at the insertion of the tentorium into the extremity of the petrous bone, and forms the large gan- .glion of a semilunar form called Ccisserian (Jig* 21. 12., • fig. 22. 1.). The ganglion immediately divides into the : three large nerves, the ophthalmic, superior maxillary, and inferior maxillary. The Ophthalmic has just been described with the con- tents of the orbit. We must now examine the maxillary nerves. The Superior maxillary nerve (fig- 22. io.) passes : forwards to the foramen rotundum, crosses the spheno- maxillary fossa, and enters the canal in the floor of the orbit, along which it runs to the infra-orbital foramen. 1 Emerging on the face, beneath the levator labii superioris i muscle, it divides into a lash of branches, 16., which are idistributed to the muscles and integument of the cheek, ind form a plexus with the facial nerve. Branches: — In the splieno-maxillary fossa. Two from Meckel's ganglion, fig. 22. 12. Orbital - - - 11. Posterior dental - - 13. In the infra-orbital canal. Middle dental - - - 14.

The Tico branches {fig. 22. 12.) from Meckel’s ganglion ocend from that body to join the nerve, as it crosses the oheno-maxillary fossa. The Orbital branch (fig. 22.11.) enters the orbit through le spheno-maxillary fissure, and divides into two branches; xhrymal, which ascends along the outer wall of the orbit » the lachrymal gland, and communicates with the chrymal nerve; temporo-malar, which passes forwards id divides into two branches, one piercing the malar >ne, and distributed to the integument of the cheek; * L

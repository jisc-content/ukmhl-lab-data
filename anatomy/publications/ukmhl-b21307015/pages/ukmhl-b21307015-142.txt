112 PALMAR MUSCLES. ACTIONS. T-,- jj T one dorsal, fin. 10. 6. Ring finger ( one palmar^. 10. ! Little finger, remaining palmar, fig. 10. 9. The radial artery passes into the palm of the hand between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle and the perforating branches of the deep palmar arch, between the heads of the other dorsal interossei. Actions. — The actions of the muscles of the hand are expressed in their names. Those of the radial group be- long to the thumb, and provide for three of its movements, abduction, adduction, and fiexion. The ulnar group, in like manner, are subservient to the same motions of the little finger, and the interossei are abductors and adductors of the several fingers. The lumbricales are accessory in their actions to the deep flexors : they were called by the earlier anatomists, fiducinae, i. e. fiddlers’ muscles from an idea that they might effect the fractional movements by which the performer is enabled to produce the various notes on that instrument. In relation to the axis of the hand (fig. 10.), the four dorsal interossei are abductors, and the three palmar, ad- ductors. It will therefore be seen that each finger is pro- vided with its proper adductor and abductor, two flexors and (with the exception of the middle and ring fingers) two extensors. The thumb has moreover a flexor and extensor of the metacarpal bone; and the little finger a flexor of the metacarpal bone without an extensor.

The Right ventricle, lo., is triangular and three- sided in its form. Its anterior side is convex, and forms the larger proportion of the front of the heart. The inferior side is flat, and rests upon the diaphragm ; and the inner side corresponds with the partition between the two ventricles, septum ventriculorum. The right ventricle is to be laid open by making an incision parallel with, and a little to the right of, the middle line, from the pulmonary artery in front, to the apex of the heart, and thence by the side of the middle line behind, to the auriculo-ventricular opening. It contains, to be examined, two openings, the auriculo- ventricular and that of the pulmonary artery ; two ap- paratuses of valves, the tricuspid and semilunar ; and a muscular and tendinous apparatus belonging to the tri- cuspid valves. They may be thus arranged : — Auriculo-ventricular opening, Opening of the pulmonary artery, Tricuspid valves, Semilunar valves, Chordae tendineae, Carneae columnae. The Auriculo-ventricular opening (fig. 12. 9.) is sur- rounded by a fibrous ring, covered by the lining mem- brane of the heart. It is the opening of communication between the right auricle and ventricle. The Opening of the pulmonary artery, 13., is situated close to the septum ventriculorum, on the left side of the right ventricle, and upon the anterior aspect of the heart. The Tricuspid valves (fig. 12. ll.) are three triangular folds of the lining membrane, strengthened by a thin la}rer of tendinous fibres. They are connected around the auriculo-ventricular opening by their base. Their sides and apex are thickened, and give attachment to a number of slender tendinous cords, called chordae ten- dineae. The chordce tendinece are the tendons of the thick muscular columns (columnce carnecef 12. which stand out from the walls of the ventricle, and serve as g 2

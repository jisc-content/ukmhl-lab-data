329 ANATOMY OF HERNIA. The internal oblique of one side draws the chest down- wards and outwards : both together bend it directly for- wards. Either transversalis muscle, acting singly, will diminish the size of the abdomen on its own side, and both together will constrict the entire cylinder of the cavity. The recti muscles, assisted by the pyramidales, flex the thorax upon the chest. The abdominal muscles are the chief agents of expul- sion ; by their action the foetus is expelled from the uterus, the urine from the bladder, the faeces from the rectum, the bile from the gall-bladder, and the ingesta from the stomach and bowels in vomiting. To produce these efforts they all act together. Their violent and continued action produces hernia; and, acting spasmo- dically, they may occasion rupture of the viscera. Anatomy of Hernia. The herniae occurring in the parietes of the abdomen have been divided by Sir Astley Cooper into four spe- cies ; namely, umbilical, ventral, inguinal, and femoral: to which may be added, as occasionally occurring, phrenic, obturator, ischiatic, gluteal, perineal, and, in the female, vaginal. Umbilical hernia occurs at the umbilicus from weaken- ing of the linea alba, either by over-distension, as in utero-gestation, or from congenital deficiency. Its cover- ings are, the Integument, Superficial fascia, Distended aponeurosis, Peritoneum. Ventral hernia occurs chiefly in the linea semilunaris, and from the same causes: its coverings are the same; but it has usually three layers of aponeurosis. Inguinal hernia is of two kinds, oblique and direct: the former takes the course of the spermatic canal, descend- inS by the s,de of the spermatic cord. The latter (direct) pushes directly through the external abdominal ring, carrying before it the conjoined tendon of t ie internal oblique and transversalis muscles.

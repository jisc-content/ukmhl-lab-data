RADIAL ARTERY. BRANCHES. 98 Hand Princeps pollicis. Radialis indicis. Interosseae. Perforantes. The Recurrent branch turns upward in the space between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus to supply the structures about the joint. It inosculates with the superior profunda artery. The Muscular branches, as in every other part of the body, supply the muscles adjacent to the artery. The Superjicialis voice is given off from the radial artery while at the wrist. It passes between the fibres of the abductor pollicis muscle, and inosculates with the termina- tion of the ulnar artery, completing the superficial palmar arch. The Carpal branches are intended for the supply of the wrist, the anterior carpal in front, and the posterior, the larger of the two, behind. The Metacarpal branch runs forwards on the second dorsal interosseous muscle, and is distributed to the adjoin- ing sides of the index and middle fingers. Sometimes it is of very large size. The I)orsales pollicis are two small branches, running along the sides of the dorsal aspect of the thumb. The Princeps pollicis descends along the border of the metacarpal bone, between the abductor indicis and adductor pollicis to the base of the first phalanx, where it divides into two branches, which are distributed to the two sides of the palmar aspect of the thumb. The Radialis indicis is also situated between the abductor indicis and adductor pollicis, and runs along the radial side of the index finger, forming its collateral artery. The Interossece and perforantes are branches of the deep palmar arch, the former supplying the interosseous muscles, the latter passing between the two heads of the dorsal interossei, to inosculate with the carpal and metacarpal branches. Ulnar Artery. The Ulnar artery crosses the arm obliquely to the commencement of its middle third, it then runs down the

22-t SACRAL PLEXUS AND ITS BRANCHES. 3. OBTURATOR NERVE. This arises principally from the third lumbar nerve; it descends on the inner side of the psoas, near the brim of the pelvis, then passes through the obturator foramen, and, like the artery, divides into an Internal and an External Branch. 4. LUMBO-SACRAL NERVE. This large nerve is formed from the fourth and fifth lumbar ; it descends into the pelvis, where it divides into two branches; the Communicating, which joins the sacral plexus, and the Superior Glu- teal Nerve; this escapes with the gluteal artery through the upper part of the sacral notch, above the pyriformis muscle, and divides into branches to be distributed with the artery to the gluteal muscles. SACRAL PLEXUS. This plexus consists of the communicating nerve, and the anterior branches of the five sacral nerves; these escape through the anterior sacral foramina, and, like the other spinal nerves, receive twigs from the sympathetic; the three upper are very large

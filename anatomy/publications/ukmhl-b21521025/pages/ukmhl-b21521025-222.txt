202 SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. 2. Infra-orbital, 3. Sphenopalatine. 1st. The Alveolar, or Superior Dental Nerve, passes out of the fossa with the superior dental artery, and supplies the molar and bicuspid teeth of the upper jaw. 2nd. The Infra-orbital branch continues along the floor of the orbit, and appears in the face at the infra-orbital foramen; between the levator labii superioris alaquse nasi and the levator anguli oris muscles ; previous to which, it gives off two twigs,— one passes through the malar bone, the other—the Anterior Dental, supplies the incisor and canine teeth by passing down the fore part of the antrum, to the lining membrane of which it also gives branches. 3rd. The Spheno-palatine portion consists of two or three short branches, which join (or form) the small ganglion of Meckel, or the Spheno-palatine, which is placed within the spheno-maxillary fossa : from this ganglion three branches are given off:— 1st. The Spheno-palatine, or Lateral Nasal, which enters the nose through the foramen of the same name; 2nd. The Palato-mamillary, or Posterior Pala- tine, which passes to the roof of the mouth by the canal of the same name; some of its branches run as far as the foramen incisivum, where they join with twigs of

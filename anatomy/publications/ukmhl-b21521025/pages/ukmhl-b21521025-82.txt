62 MUSCLES OF FACE. MUSCLES UPON THE SIDE OF THE FACE,â€”FOUR PAIRS. 1. Masseter, 2. Temporalis, 3. Pterygoideus Interims, 4. Pterygoideus Externus. The Masseter consists of superficial and deep portions; the superficial arises from the malar bone and the tuberosity of the upper maxilla; the fibres pass obliquely backwards to be inserted into the outer surface of the angle of the jaw. The deep portion arises from the zygomatic arch, as far back as the glenoid cavity ; the fibres pass obliquely forwards to be inserted into the outer surface of the ramus of the jaw. The Temporalis arises from the temporal apo- neurosis, and the temporal fossa; (this extends from the external angular process of the frontal bone to the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and from the semicircular ridge upon the parietal to the crest at the root of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone;) it is inserted into the coronoid process of the lower jaw. The Pterygoideus Internus fills the pterygoid fossa, it arises from the inner surface of the external pterygoid process, and from the pterygoid process of the palate bone; it is inserted into the inner surface of the angle of the lower jaw.

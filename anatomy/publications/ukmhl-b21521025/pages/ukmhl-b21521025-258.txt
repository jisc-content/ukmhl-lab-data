* ANALOGY BETWEEN THE VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE UPPER AND LOWER EXTREMITIES. ARTERIES. The very close and interesting resemblance between the vessels and nerves of the upper and lower ex- tremities, cannot have failed to have attracted the attention of the student. The Brachial artery in the arm corresponds with the Femoral in the thigh. The Radial of the fore- arm, which supplies the dorsum of the hand, the whole of the thumb, and the radial side of the index * In making this comparison the fore-arm should not be in a state of supination, as it is usually supposed to be in descriptive anatomy, but completely prone, with the hand placed upon the palm; when the analogy, not only in the vetsels and nerves, but also in the muscles, becomes much stronger than in a state of supi- nation. It will then be evident, that the terms flexion and extension of the wrist joint, might with propriety be reversed in their appli- cation, and what is usually called extension be denominated flexion: at least if flexion be the active state (so to speak) of a limb, and extension be the return of it to a straight or to a line but slightly bent with the part above; as the motion of the hand backwards, is, I believe, both more extensive, important, and useful, than it is in the forward direction.

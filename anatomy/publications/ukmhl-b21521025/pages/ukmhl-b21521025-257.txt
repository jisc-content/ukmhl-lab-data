SEMILUNAR GANGLION AND ITS BRANCHES. 237 ded with minute ganglia, in the midst of which the cceliac axis is situated; this is the solar plexus: it is placed upon the aorta and above the pancreas; it receives branches from both pneumo-gastric nerves. From the solar plexus filaments pass upon the three divisions of the cceliac axis, which are respec- tively named the Gastric, the Splenic, and the Hepatic plexuses ; numerous other filaments pass be- tween the layers of the mesentery, with the superior mesenteric artery, to form the Superior Mesen- teric plexus; while others again pass with each renal artery, constituting the Renal plexus, which, on each side, receives a part of the smaller splanchnic nerve : the renal plexus gives off the Spermatic plexus. The filaments which are found at the root of the meso-colon form the Inferior Mesenteric plexus, which, like the others, accompanies the ra- mifications of the blood vessels of the same name. Many filaments pass from the inferior mesenteric plexus into the pelvis, these, with branches from the lumbar and sacral ganglia, form plexuses round the divisions of the internal iliac artery, consti- tuting the Hypogastric and Pelvic plexuses.

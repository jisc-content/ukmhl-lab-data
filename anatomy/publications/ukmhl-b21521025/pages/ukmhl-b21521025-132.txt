CLASSIFICATION OP MUSCLES 112 MUSCLES OF THE HEAD. Direct motion of the head is performed through two articulations; extension and flexion are accom- plished by the motion of the occipital condyles upon the atlas; lateral or rotatory motion, by the atlas moving upon the vertebra dentata; to both joints are attached proper muscles; but the extensive motion which the head enjoys is the result of the combined movements of different portions, or even of the whole vertebral column, through the medium of most of the muscles attached to the trunk. Flexors forwards—four. Platysma Myoides, Sterno-cleido-mastoideus, Recti Capitis Antici, Major et Minor, Flexors laterally,—three. Rectus Capitis Lateralis, Obliquus Capitis Superior, Upper part of Trapezius. Extensors,—seven. Upper part of the Trapezius, Splenius Capitis, Trachelo-mastoideus, Complexus, Recti Capitis Postici, Major et Minor, Obliquus Capitis Superior.

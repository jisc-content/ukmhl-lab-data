221 DORSAL NERVES. humerus, internally, by the long head of the triceps, superiorly, by the edge of the sub-scapularis muscle, and inferiorly, by the teres major and latissimus dorsi muscles. DORSAL NERVES. There are twelve pairs of dorsal nerves; their posterior branches pass between the transverse pro- cesses of the vertebrae to the dorsal muscles. Each anterior branch is joined by one or two filaments from the thoracic ganglions of the sympathetic. The first nerve, the anterior branch of which has already been described as entering into the brachial plexus, is by far the largest; it escapes from the canal between the first and second dorsal vertebrae ; the last nerve escapes below the twelfth, and com- municates with the first lumbar nerve. The remaining eleven pairs pass outwards ; at first between the external layer of intercostal muscles and pleura; from the angle of the ribs they lie between the two layers of muscles. The nerves not only supply the intercostal muscles, but the upper also supply the integuments and parietes of the thorax, and the inferior assist in supplying the diaphragm and abdominal muscles. The second and third dorsal nerves, as they pass round the thorax, send each a branch across the axillary space to the integuments u 3

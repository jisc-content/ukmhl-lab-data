235 ABDOMINAL PORTION OF SYMPATHETIC. The Greater Splanchnic Nerve is formed by the union of filaments from the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth ganglia; these all pass inwards and unite in one cord upon the eleventh dorsal vertebra. The cord enters the abdomen either through the aortic opening in the diaphragm, or separated from it by a few fibres of the cms. It terminates in the semilunar ganglion. The Smaller Splanchnic Nerve is formed by filaments from the two last ganglia; it pierces the crus of the diaphragm, and divides into two branches, one of which joins the greater splanchnic nerve; the other enters the renal plexus. ABDOMINAL PORTION OP THE SYMPATHETIC. The branches of this portion of the sympathetic are derived from the chain of ganglia placed upon the lumbar and sacral portion of the vertebral column, and from the splanchnic nerves ; those from the latter form numerous and most intricate plexiform ar- rangements. The Lumbar Ganglia are four or five on each side the vertebrae, they are internal to the psoas muscle; from each ganglion one or two branches pass through the muscle to join the lumbar nerves, others

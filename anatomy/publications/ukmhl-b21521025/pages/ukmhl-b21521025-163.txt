DEEP FASCTjE. 143 fascia of the perinseum, or the triangular ligament of the urethra. The Deep Fascia of the Perin&um is of a trian- gular form; the apex, thin and weak, is under the symphysis pubis, with the ligaments of which it is connected; the base of it is towards the rectum, at the central point of the perinseum it is joined by the superficial fascia, and becoming cellular, is lost upon the outer surface of the levator ani and upon the rectum; laterally, it is attached to the rami of the ischium and pubis. This fascia is very strong and consists of two layers, between which, at the base of it, the artery of the bulb runs to the urethra. The fascia gives passage to the urethra, and in so doing its two layers divide and separate; the anterior envelopes the bulb with a strong covering and retains it in situ, the posterior layer is continued backwards upon the membranous part of the urethra to the prostrate gland, to which it gives a capsule, and is lost at the neck of the bladder.

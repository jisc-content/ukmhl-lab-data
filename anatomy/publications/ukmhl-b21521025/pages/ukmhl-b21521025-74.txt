54 ARTICULATIONS OF LOWER EXTREMITY. FIBULO-TIBIAL ARTICULATIONS. The tibia and fibula are united firmly together superiorly and inferiorly, in each situation by a syno- vial membrane and two ligaments, in the intervening space by the inter-osseous ligament. Upper Articulation. The Anterior and Posterior Ligaments are similar, the one passes on the anterior, the other on the pos- terior surface, from the tibia to the fibula. The Inter-osseous Ligament consists of a series of fibres which pass between the tibia and fibula throughout the greater part of their course, it is sometimes called the Middle Articulation. Lower Articulation. The Anterior and Posterior Ligaments are each of a triangular form, and pass from the outer mal- leolus to the tibia. ARTICULATION OF THE ANKLE JOINT. In this articulation the head of the astragalus is received into the cavity formed by the libia and fibula; there is a synovial sac and five ligaments. 1. The Anterior Ligament passes from the fore part of the tibia to the anterior surface of the astra- galus. 2. The Internal Lateral, or Deltoid Ligament, is

FASCIJE OP AN APONEUROTIC CHARACTER. 133 layer passes over the clavicle and the origin of the sterno-mastoideus, before the sternum, where it is lost upon the pectoralis major ; in the median line, the fascia is closely connected to the sternum and inter-clavicular ligament. The deep layer passes behind the clavicle and sternum, covers the subcla- vius muscle, and sends a process, both externally and internally, along the great vessels. As it passes from the subclavius outwards, it becomes very strong, and arches over the subclavian vessels to be connected to the coracoid process of the scapula, constituting the costo-coracoid ligament. The upper part of the fascia continues in two layers ; the super- ficial passes upwards over the parotid gland, to which it gives a dense covering, and is attached to the zygoma, and to the cartilaginous portion of the ex- ternal auditory tube: the deep layer passes inwards and upwards, being attached to the styloid process of the temporal bone, and to the angle of the jaw, between the parotid and submaxillary glands, forming the stylo-maxillary ligament. Upper Extremity.â€”The fascia of the arm forms a sheath for the muscles, and also sends processes in between them, but it is neither so strong nor so intimately connected with the muscles as that of the fore-arm. It arises from the spine and acro- mion of the scapula with the deltoid muscle, over which it passes; it receives a considerable accession of strength from the insertion of this muscle, as well N

209 PNEUMO-GASTRIC NERVE. 10. PNEUMO-GASTRIC NERVE. The Par Vagum is connected by eight or ten filaments, with the same tract of the medulla oblon- gata as the last nerve, and immediately below it. This large nerve also leaves the cranium through the lacerated opening, in a distinct fibrous sheath, ante- rior to the jugular vein; it passes down within the carotid sheath, and enters the thorax, on the left side of the body, anterior to the aorta, on the right side, between the subclavian artery and vein â–  it descends behind the roots of the lungs, in the pos- terior mediastinum, and applies itself to the oesopha- gus, upon which it passes into the abdomen, to be distributed to the stomach. Immediately under the cranium the pneumo-gastric is closely connected with the lingual, spinal accessory, glosso-pharyn- geal, and sympathetic nerves; at this point the nerve presents a gangliform enlargement. The branches given off are very numerous : they are the 1st. Pharyngeal Nerve, 2nd. Superior Laryngeal Nerve, 3rd. Cardiac Branches, 4th. Inferior or Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve, which, on the right side, winds round the subclavian artery; upon the left, round the arch of the aorta, close to the remains of the ductus arteriosus. 5th. A few branches to form the Anterior Pul- monary Plexus. t 3

INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. 203 the lateral nasal nerve, forming a slight enlargement, called the ganglion of Cloquet; 3rd. The Vidian, or Pterygoid, which passes to the base of the cranium, through the vidian canal, and divides into an Inferior and Superior branch. The inferior enters the carotid canal, where it joins, upon the carotid artery, with filaments from the superior cervical ganglion. The superior twig enters the cranium through the anterior lacerated opening, and passes along the hiatus Fallopii, where it joins with the facial nerve, from which it again separates, to pass across the tym- panum, under the name of the chorda tympani; it leaves this cavity by the glenoid fissure, to become connected with the gustatory nerve, and finally terminates in the sub-maxillary ganglion, and is distributed to the sub-maxillary gland. 3rd Division. The Inferior Maxillary Nerve.â€”That por- tion of the fifth which passes behind the semilunar ganglion forms a part of this nerve; it passes out of the cranium through the foramen ovale, and is, at its exit, placed between the tensor palati and the pterygoideus externus muscles; it divides into two branches. 1. Superior or External, 2. Inferior or Internal. 1. The External is the smaller branch, and

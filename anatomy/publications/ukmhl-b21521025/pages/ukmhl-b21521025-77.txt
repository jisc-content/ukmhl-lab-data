ARTICULATIONS OF LOWER EXTREMITY. 57 connected to each other by transverse dorsal and plantar ligaments. ARTICULATION OF THE METATARSAL BONES ANI> PHALANGES. The three inner metatarsal bones are articulated with the cuneiform bones, and the two outer with the cuboid; dorsal and plantar bands of fibres, cor- responding to each metatarsal bone, connect them with the tarsal bones. The bases of the four outer metatarsal bones are connected to each other by synovial sacs, inter-osseous, dorsal, and plantar transverse ligaments. The distal ends of all the five metatarsal bones are connected together by transverse ligamentous bands. The articulations of the metatarsal bones with the phalanges, and these with each other, as in the hand, are formed by an anterior and two lateral liga- ments.

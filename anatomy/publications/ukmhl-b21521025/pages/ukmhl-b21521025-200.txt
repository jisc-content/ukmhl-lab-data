INOSCULATION OF ARTERIES. 180 with vessels on the same side of the body, and con- sequently are only concerned in those cases where the obstruction occurs in the subclavian from which they arise. If the obstruction occurs in either the Common Carotid or the Subclavian, in the first stage of their course, before they have given off any branches, and especially in the latter vessel; then, not only would blood flow from the opposite side, but the communication between the branches of the subcla- vian and external carotid of the same side is so extensive that much blood would necessarily pass from one vessel into the other. Thus, if the common carotid or trunk of the ex- ternal carotid be obliterated, then blood will pass into it from the branches of the opposite external and internal carotids, and from the inferior thyroid of the opposite side; also from the inferior thyroid, ascending cervical, and superficial cervical branches of the same side. If it be the subclavian in the first stage of its course which is obliterated, then the blood will find its way into the vessel beyond this point, by the inferior thyroid anastomosing with the two thyroid arteries of the opposite side and the superior thyroid of the same side; the ascending, superficial, and deep cer- vical branches, will convey blood from the carotid of the same side; the internal mammary and the superior intercostal, from the branches of the tho- racic aorta, and even from the deep epigastric artery ;

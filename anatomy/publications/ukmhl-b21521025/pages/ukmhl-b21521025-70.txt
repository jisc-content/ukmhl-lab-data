ARTICULATIONS OF PELVIS. 50 1. The Sacro-lumbar Ligament, which extends from the transverse process of the last lumbar ver- tebra to the upper part of the sacrum. 2. The Ilio-lumbar Ligament, which extends be- tween the transverse process of the last lumbar ver- tebra, and the superior posterior spinous process and crista of the ilium. The coccyx is united to the sacrum by a continu- ation of the anterior and posterior ligaments of the ver- tebral column, and by a thin layer of fibro-cartilage. The ilium on each side is firmly united to the sacrum, by a thick layer of cartilage and by four liga- ments. 1. and 2. The Anterior and Posterior Sacro-iliac Ligaments, which extend, the one on the anterior, the other on the posterior surface, between the ilium and the two upper pieces of the sacrum. 3. The Posterior, or great Sacro-sciatic Ligament, extends from the posterior inferior spine of the ilium, and from the side of the sacrum and coccyx, to the inner margin of the tuber ischii; and under the name of falciform ligament, it is attached to the ascending ramus of this bone. 4. The Anterior, or smaller Sacro-sciatic Liga- ment, arises in common with the last, and is inserted into the spine of the ischium. The symphysis pubis is formed by the thick tri-

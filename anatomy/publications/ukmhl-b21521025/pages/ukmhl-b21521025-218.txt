OPTIC NERVE. 198 nerve terminates in a bulbous enlargement, from whence a great number of fine filaments arise, which pass through the foramina into the nose. This should be regarded as the proper attachment of the nerves themselves; the bulbous enlargement and cord is the olfactory ganglion or tubercle. The olfactory filaments are lost in the pituitary membrane lining the nose, and principally in that portion of it which covers the upper part. The branches are arranged into three sets :â€”1st. An internal, distributed upon the septum nasi; 2nd. An external, distributed upon the turbinated bones; 3rd. A middle, distributed upon the roof of the nostrils. 2. OPTIC NERVE. The optic nerve is attached to the natis, the testis, and the corpora geniculata; it forms a flattened band, the Tractus Opticus, which passes under the crus cerebri, and converging to the median line, anterior to the sella turcica and corpora mammillaria, it forms with its fellow the Optic Commissure- This is placed upon the olivary process of the sphenoid bone, and receives some fibres from the tuber cine- reum. In the commissure there appears to be a mingling of fibres from the opposite nerves. The nerve leaves the cranium by the foramen opticum with the optic artery, and passes through the scle-

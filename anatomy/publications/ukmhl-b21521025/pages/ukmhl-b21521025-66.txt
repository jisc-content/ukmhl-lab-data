46 ARTICULATIONS OF UPPER EXTREMITY. RADIO-CARPAL ARTICULATION. In this articulation the under end of the radius and inter-articular cartilage form a shallow cavity, which receives the scaphoid, lunar, and cuneiform bones. The synovial sac is large, and as it passes over the three small bones dips in between them. There are four ligaments. 1. The Anterior Ligament extends from the lower end of the radius to the first row of carpal bones. 2. The Posterior Ligament extends from the radius to the lunar and cuneiform bones. 3. The Internal Lateral Ligament extends from the styloid process of the ulna to the cuneiform bone. 4. The External Lateral Ligament extends from the styloid process of the radius to the scaphoides and trapezium. At the wrist two ligaments are found, which tie down the flexor tendons on the anterior surface; and the extensor tendons on the posterior surface; they are the Ligamentum Carpi Annulare Anterior, which ex- tends from the pisiform and the projecting hook-like portion of the unciform, across the wrist, to the sca- phoides and trapezium.

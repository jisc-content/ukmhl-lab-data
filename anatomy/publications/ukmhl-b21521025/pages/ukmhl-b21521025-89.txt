69 MUSCLES OF LARYNX. MUSCLES OK THE LARYNX, FOUR PAIRS, AND ONE SINGLE. 1. Crico Thyroideus, 2. Crico Arytenoideus Lateralis, 3. Crico Arytenoideus Posticus, 4. Thyro Aryteniodeus, 5. Arytenoideus, (single.) The Crico Thyroideus arises from the cricoid cartilage; it is inserted into the lower margin of the thyroid. The Crico Arytenoideus Lateralis arises from the upper border of the cricoid cartilage ; it is inserted into the base of the arytenoid. The Crico Arytenoideus Posticus arises from the posterior surface of the broad portion of the cri- coid cartilage; it is inserted into the outer side of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. The Thyro Arytenoideus arises from the angle between the two alse of the thyroid cartilage; it is inserted into the anterior border of the arytenoid cartilage. The Arytenoideus fills up the posterior concave surface of the two arytenoid cartilages, some of the fibres pass transversely, others pass obliquely from the base of one cartilage to the apex of the other; from this circumstance this muscle is sometimes divided into three, the transverse and two oblique.

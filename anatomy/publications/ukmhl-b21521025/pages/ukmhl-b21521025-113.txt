MUSCLES ON ANTERIOR PART OF THIGH. 93 The Vastus Internus arises from the inter-tro- chanteric line, from the inner lip of the linea aspera, i and from the inner surface of the femur ; it is inserted into the patella by the common tendon. The CrurjEUS arises from the anterior and outer surface of the femur, (not from the inner surface), below the trochanters; it is inserted by the common tendon into the patella. The Gracilis arises from the lower part of the body of the pubis, close to the symphysis, and from its descending ramus; it is inserted into the inner surface of the tibia, directly below the tube- rosity. The Pectineus arises from the anterior surface i of the body of the pubis; it is inserted into the line which leads from the lower trochanter to the linea aspera. The Triceps Adductor consists of three distinct muscles; the adductor longus arises from the body of the pubis, between the symphysis and spinous pro- cess ; it is inserted into the middle third of the linea aspera: the adductor brevis arises from the body of the pubis below the adductor longus, between the thyroid foramen and the symphysis; it is inserted into the oblique line below the small trochanter, and into the upper part of the linea aspera: the adductor magnus arises from the tuberosity and ramus of the ischium, and from the descending ramus of the pubis; it is inserted into the ridge extending from trochanter major to the linea aspera, into the

129 SUPERFICIAL FASCIiE. in others it is very distinct and strong; it envelopes the neck immediately under the integuments, super- ficial to all the muscles, except the platysma myoides, which is developed within its tissue ; it passes down- wards over the clavicle and sternum, where it is lost in the subcutaneous membrane ; above, it is attached to the ramus of the jaw and is lost upon the face, while at the side of the neck it passes backwards over the trapezius and is gradually lost. Superficial Abdominal, Perineal, and Fe- moral Fasciae.â€”This is an important portion, in consequence of its relation to parts concerned in capital surgical operations. When the integuments are dissected off the anterior abdominal parietes, there is found over the whole of the external oblique muscle, a very thin fibrous covering: this, at the upper part, near the cartilages of the ribs, is indis- tinct and little more than cellular membrane, but as it passes downwards it becomes much stronger and more evident; it is within its structure that the superficial epigastric, circumflex ilii, and pudic vessels ramify; laterally, the superficial abdominal fascia becomes lost in the subcutaneous cellular membrane ; inferiorly, in the median line in the male, it sends a process to envelope the penis and assist in forming a suspensory ligament for it; on either side, as the spermatic cord escapes from the external abdominal ring, it carries with it a prolongation of this fascia; this process envelopes the cord and passes to the

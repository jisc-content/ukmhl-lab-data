FCETAL CIRCULATION. 193 of its contents into the right ventricle, through the auriculo-ventricular opening; but the largest por- tion passes at once from the right into the left auricle through the foramen ovale. The younger the foetus the greater is the proportion of blood sent, through the foramen ovale, directly into the left auricle ; and the position of the Eustachian Valve, with regard to the opening of the inferior cava, renders it toler- ably certain, that it is principally the blood from this vessel which is so directed. From the right ventricle the blood is forced into the pulmonary artery, which divides into two small branches, the right and left pulmonary arteries, and one large branch, the Ductus Arteriosus ; through the latter the greater part of the blood passes directly into the aorta, while that smaller part which enters the pulmonary arteries and passes through the lungs, is returned by the pulmonary veins to the left auricle: it there mingles with that sent through the foramen ovale, with which it passes into the left ventricle, through the auriculo-ventricular opening; the valve of the foramen ovale not allowing blood to pass from the left into the right auricle ; from the ventricle it is propelled into the aorta. The aorta distributes its branches as in the adult, but in the iliacs there is a remarkable difference. In the adult the external iliac artery is larger than the internal, in the foetus the contrary obtains. The inter- nal iliac runs along the brim of the pelvis, and passes up the side of the bladder under the name of hypo- s

206 AUDITORY AND FACIAL NERVES. also supposed to be the identical filaments received in the cavernous sinus, by these three nerves from the sympathetic, and by which the lenticular is put in communication with the first cervical ganglion. The lenticular ganglion gives off the two fasciculi of ciliary nerves; these consist of from ten to twenty filaments; they pierce the sclerotic coat, and are distributed to the ciliary ligament and iris. 7. PORTIO MOLLIS, OR AUDITORY NERVE. The Portio Mollis and Portio Dura are very closely connected together, but their separate attach- ments to the brain is evident. The Auditory Nerve is attached to the floor of the fourth ventricle (calamus scriptorius) by three or four white striae, and also to the anterior part of the restiform body, immediately below the pons Varolii; it forms a large soft nerve, which enters the internal auditory foramen, where it divides into an anterior branch for the cochlea, and a posterior branch for the vestibule and semicircular canals. 8. PORTIO DURA, OR FACIAL NERVE. This nerve is attached to the upper part of the tractus respiratorius, between the olivary and resti-

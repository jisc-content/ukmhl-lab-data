LENTICULAR GANGLION. 205 to the artery. Superiorly is the third, then the fourth, next the ophthalmic division of the fifth, and lastly, to the inner side of the fifth and close to the artery, is the sixth nerve. Upon the artery several filaments of the sympathetic nerve are found, which have mounted upon it into the cranium from the superior cervical ganglion ; these filaments are connected with the nerves in the sinus, particularly with the fifth and sixth. As these nerves are about to enter the orbit through the lacerated opening, they have not the same relation to each other as in the middle of the sinus; the third has divided into its two branches, and the fifth into its three. Most superiorly is the fourth nerve, then the frontal branch of the fifth, the upper or smaller division of the third follows, then the lachrymal, next the nasal, below which is the lower branch of the third, and beneath all is the sixth nerve. LENTICULAR GANGLION. The Lenticular Ganglion is a very small nervous mass situated within the orbit, on the outer side of the optic nerve, between it and the external rectus muscle; it is supposed to belong to the sympathetic system, and to be formed by small twigs which pass to it, from the sixth, from the lower branch of the third, and from the nasal nerves; which twigs are T

240 NKBVES. divides into the radial and the posterior inter-osseal nerves to supply the extensors of the wrist, (flexors in the state of pronation) the extensors of the fingers, and the dorsum of the hand. The Peroneal at the head of the fibula divides into the Musculocutaneous and Anterior Tibial nerves to supply the flexors of the ankle, the extensors of the toes, and the dorsum of the foot. The Median and Ulnar nerves supply the flexors (extensors in a state of pronation) of the wrist and the flexors of the fingers; the Median also furnishes branches for the whole of the thumb, the first and second fingers, and the radial side of the third; the Ulnar for the ulnar side of the third, and the whole of the fourth finger. In the leg, the Posterior Tibial supplies the extensors of the ankle and the flexors of the toes; also, by means of the Internal Plantar branch (the Median), the whole of the three inner toes, and the tibial side of the fourth; by the external Plantar (the Ulnar) the fibular side of the fourth, and the whole of the fifth toes. Were it in this place desirable to do so, this comparison might easily be carried out more into detail, so as to comprehend even the smaller branches of the blood vessels and nerves. A.

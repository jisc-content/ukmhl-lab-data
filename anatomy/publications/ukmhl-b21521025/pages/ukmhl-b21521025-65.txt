ARTICULATIONS OF UPPER EXTREMITY. 45 composition of it, and the synovial sac is common to both. The head of the radius is received into the smaller sigmoid cavity of the ulna. There is only one ligament, The Coronary, which is attached to the anterior and posterior edges of the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, it passes close round the neck of the radius, but is not connected to it. The opposed edges of the radius and ulna are connected by two ligaments, which are sometimes called the middle radio-ulnar articulation. 1. The Oblique Ligament extends in a cord-like form, downwards and outwards, from the coronoid process of the ulna to the tubercle of the radius. 2. The Interosseal Ligament consists of a broad expanded series of fasciculi, which pass obliquely inwards, from the radius to the ulna throughout the greater part of their extent. In the inferior radio-ulnar articulation the ulna is received in a concave surface of the radius. The bones are retained in situ by the inter-articular carti- lage, which extends from the inner edge of the radius to the styloid process of the ulna and separates this bone from the carpus, by a synovial sac which is called the sacciform ligament, and by a series of anterior and posterior transverse fibres which pass from one bone to the other.

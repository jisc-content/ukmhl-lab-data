ARTICULATIONS OF LOWER EXTREMITY. 51 angular interposed plate of fibro-cartilage and two ligaments. 1. The Anterior Ligament is composed of trans- verse fibres, which pass from one pubic bone to the other. 2. The Posterior Ligament is in like manner composed of transverse fibres; it is the stronger of the two, and extends between the rami, below the arch of the pubis, under the name of the sub-pubic ligament. The Obturator, or Thyroid Ligament, fills up the foramen of the same name. ILIO-FEMORAL ARTICULATION. The acetabulum is, in the recent state, consider- ably deepened by the cotyloid ligament passing round the margin of it. The bones are connected by a synovial membrane and three ligaments. 1. The Capsular Ligament is the strongest in the body, it encircles the head of the femur, passing from the circumference of the acetabulum to the base of the neck of the femur. 2. The Accessory Ligament, like that of the shoulder joint, scarcely deserves a distinct name; it is a strong layer of fibres which passes from the infe- rior anterior spine of the ilium to the fore part of the capsular ligament.

183 INOSCULATION OF ARTERIES. blood through the exceedingly numerous inosculations between the visceral branches of the opposite iliacs would be very considerable. If the External Iliac be obstructed, the communication would be free and direct, through the internal mammary, with the epi- gastric artery : the circumflex ilii with the ilio-lumbar and lumbar: the obturator and internal pudic, with the internal circumflex and external pudic : and the gluteal and ischiadic, with the external circum- flex and perforating branches of the profunda. When the obstruction takes place in the Femoral below the profunda, as in the ordinary operation for popliteal aneurism, all the branches of the profunda are free, and pour their blood into branches of the anastomotica magna, the tibial recurrent, the supe- rior muscular branches, and the articular branches of the popliteal. In the leg and foot, as in the fore-arm and hand, the communication is so free, that to prevent the blood from entering into any given portion of these vessels, it is necessary to tie it at both ends.

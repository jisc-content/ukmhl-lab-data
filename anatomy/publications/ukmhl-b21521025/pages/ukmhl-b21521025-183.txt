In this course the artery rests upon the short head of the triceps, and upon the insertion of the coraco-brachialis and the brachialis anticus muscles. It is covered by the integuments, the fascia, the coraco-brachialis, and the biceps; numerous branches are given off, only four of which are commonly distinguished by names. 1.

FASCIiE OP AN APONEUROTIC CHARACTER. 135 and forms a sheath for the flexor tendons; it is attached internally, to the cuneiform bone, exter- nally, to the scaphoid and trapezium. From it arises the very dense and strong Palmar Fascia, posteriorly this is narrow, and is strengthened by the insertion of the palmaris longus; it expands over the palm, becomes much broader, and divides into four fasci- culi, which pass to the heads of the metacarpal bones of the four fingers, where they split to give passage to the flexor tendons, with the digital blood vessels and nerves; they are then inserted into the flexor sheaths and into the lateral ligaments of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints. Lower Extremity. â€” When the integuments, cellular membrane, and superficial fascia, have been removed from the inferior extremity, it is found to be enveloped in a very strong, dense covering, the Fascia Lata. As is seen in the arm, the fascia lata not only covers the muscles, but in some places sends processes between them, and is also attached to the femur ; it is much stronger on the anterior and outer parts of the thigh than posteriorly or inter- nally. The fascia lata arises, behind, from the crest of the ilium, from the sacrum, and from the coccyx ; internally, from the pubis and ischium; anteriorly, from the whole of poupart's ligament: as it passes downwards upon the thigh it sends a process to form a partial sheath for the sartorius, by which the muscle is retained in situ ; it is also attached

/ CLASSIFICATION OF MUSCLES ACCORDING TO THEIR ACTIONS. In the foregoing pages the origin and insertion of muscles are given as briefly as possible; it is how- ever, not only useful, but absolutely essential, con- stantly to bear in mind their combined actions. In the following tables those muscles are grouped together, which from position or function, should be studied at the same time. It will be observed that many muscles are mentioned more than once, this is because they have more than one simple direct action, while the functions of others are not enumerated, because their names and positions suffi- ciently call to mind their uses ; or else, that the actions of several are rather to be regarded as one compound whole, (as in those of the back), to at- tempt to analyze the individual actions of which, would be too complicated and tedious for the plan of this work, and at the same time attended with little benefit. For the same reason, only those muscles which act more directly on any part are given; but it must not be forgotten that, in most cases, these are much assisted in delicacy and variety of action by r ^1

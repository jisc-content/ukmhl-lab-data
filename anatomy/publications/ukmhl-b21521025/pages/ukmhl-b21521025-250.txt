230 GANGLIA OF HEAD. t supposed to belong to this system, as the Lenticular, Cloquet's, Meckel's, Arnold's, and Ribes's. GANGLIA OF THE HEAD. Five small ganglia are found in the head and face, the larger of these have been described. They communicate with the other parts of the sympathetic system, by means of two or three small filaments which pass upon the internal carotid artery, from the superior cervical ganglion. These filaments form a plexus round the artery, and in the cavernous sinus join the cerebral nerves which pass through it. 1. The Ganglion of Ribes is placed upon the small branch which in the inter-cerebral fissure com- municates between the two anterior cerebral arteries. This, like Cloquet's, is a single ganglion. 2. The Lenticular or Ophthalmic Ganglion is within the orbit, between the optic nerve and the abductor muscle. 3. The Spheno-palatine or Meckel's Gan- glion is placed in the spheno-maxillary fossa. 4. The Palato-maxillary or Cloquet's Gan glion is found in the foramen incisivum.

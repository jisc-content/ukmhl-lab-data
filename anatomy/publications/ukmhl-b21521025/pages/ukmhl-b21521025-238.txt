218 Axillary plexus and its branches. 4. INTERNAL CUTANEOUS NERVE. Below the elbow this nerve becomes cutaneous, and accompanies the basilic vein; it supplies the integuments on the inner side of the fore-arm, down to the wrist and hand. 5. EXTERNAL CUTANEOUS NERVE. This nerve is also called the musculo-cutaneous, from its piercing the coraco-brachialis muscle, and supplying the muscles on the anterior surface of the humerus; in the fore-arm it becomes cutaneous, and descends with the cephalic vein, on its radial side ; it may be traced as far as the thumb. 6. MEDIAN NERVE. This is a very large nerve ; it arises by two roots between which is the brachial artery; at the upper part of the arm this vessel is on the inner side of the nerve, but in the middle of the arm the nerve crosses over the vessel, and at the bend of the elbow lies to its inner side. The nerve descends in the fore-arm between the two layers of muscles, and passes under the annular ligament, where its size is increased; in the palm of the hand it divides into five digital branches, to supply the thumb, the first, the second, and the radial side of the third

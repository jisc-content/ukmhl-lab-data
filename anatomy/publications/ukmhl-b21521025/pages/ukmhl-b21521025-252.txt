232 CERVICAL PORTION OF SYMPATHETIC. 4. Anterior Branches, which are very numerous ; they join with the pneumo-gastric and facial nerves, and form plexuses round the divisions of the exter- nal carotid artery. 5. Inferior or Descending Branches, are those which connect the first to the second ganglion, and also one or two filaments which constitute the superior cardiac nerve. The Middle Cervical Ganglion is not always present, it is smaller than the superior, and is placed upon the fifth vertebra, behind the carotid, near the spot where the superior thyroideal artery passes posterior to the sheath : it sends 1. Internal Branches to the larynx and oeso- phagus. 2. External Branches to the cervical nerves and their divisions. 3. Anterior Branches to form the middle cardiac nerve. 4. Inferior Branches to connect it with the infe- rior ganglion. The Inferior Cervical Ganglion is found between the scalenus anticus and the longus colli muscles, near the transverse process of the seventh vertebra, and immediately behind the origin of the vertebral artery : its branches are 1. Superior Branches, which are numerous, and pass with the vertebral artery.

PULMONARY CIRCULATION. 145 heart contains dark or venous blood, the left florid or arterial. PULMONARY CIRCULATION. The pulmonary artery conveys the venous blood from the heart to the lungs ; it arises from the right ventricle, immediately in front of the aorta, on a level with the cartilage of the fourth rib of the left side at its junction with the sternum; it also cor- responds with the body of the fourth dorsal vertebra. It forms a large short trunk, about two inches and a half long; passing backwards and to the left, it divides into the right and left pulmonary arteries, of which the right is the longer and larger : this divides into three branches, the left divides into two only, corresponding with the lobes of the respective lungs. Each artery afterwards divides into an infinity of branches, from which the pulmonary veins arise; these are two on each side, they are placed before and somewhat below the corresponding artery, which is between the vein and the bronchial tube, the latter being above and behind the artery, while the veins are below and before.

â€¢210 SPINAL ACCESSORY. 6th. Behind the root of the lung the nerve itself divides and subdivides into numerous branches, to form the Posterior or Larger Pulmonary Plexus. 7th. Below the root of the lung most of the branches re-unite and gain the aesophagus upon which they run; those of the left side constituting the Anterior (Esophageal Plexus; those of the right side, the Posterior (Esophageal Plexus. 8th. Having gained the stomach, the filaments of the two nerves unite upon the larger end of it to form the Cardiac Plexus, the twigs from which are distributed upon both surfaces of this organ, be- tween the muscular and mucous coats. Some few twigs of the pneumo-gastric nerves pass into the Hepatic and Splenic Plexuses. 11. SPINAL ACCESSORY. Although this nerve arises from the spinal marrow, and as such, does not properly belong to the cerebral nerves, yet the fact of its origin so closely resembling the two last, and its entering into the cranium to pass again out with them, entitle it to be spoken of in this place. It is attached, by several filaments, to the side of the cervical portion of the spinal marrow, from the second to about the sixth vertebra; (a part, which is considered by Sir C. Bell, to be a continuation of the tractus respiratorius) its filaments are between the anterior and posterior

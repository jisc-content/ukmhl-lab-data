CERVICAL PLEXUS. 214. posterior and an anterior branch; these are of* nearly equal size, the former is distributed to the small muscles at the back of the head, the latter appears between the rectus capitis anticus minor and rectus lateralis muscles; it joins with the other nerves in this situation, as the par vagum, sympathetic, &c., and is distributed to the muscles of this region ; by joining with a branch of the second cervical nerve, it forms a nervous loop round the transverse process of the atlas. The posterior branch of the second cervical nerve is a considerable trunk, being much larger than the anterior; it passes upwards and backwards, between the obliquus capitis inferior and the complexus mus- cles; which latter, as well as the trapezius, it pierces and becomes subcutaneous, ramifying upon the back of the scalp with the branches of the occipital artery. It is called the Great Occipital Nerve. CERVICAL PLEXUS. The Cervical Plexus it situated at the side of the neck, and is formed by the anterior branches of the four (sub-occipital, and three) superior cervical nerves, which unite into loops, from whence branches arise; these are embedded in much loose cellular membrane, between the sterno-mastoideus and the trapezius muscles.

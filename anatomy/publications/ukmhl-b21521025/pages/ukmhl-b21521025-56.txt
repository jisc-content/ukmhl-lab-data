36 AMPHIARTHROSIS. cartilage, but synovial membrane also, are necessary. The bones themselves are not in contact but are held together by these tissues. This genus contains four species:â€” 1. Enarthrosis, or the ball and socket joint. 2. Ginglimus, or the hinge joint, in which the chief motion is limited to extension and flexion 3. Trochoides, or the pulley form of joint, where one bone rotates upon another; as the radius upon the ulna. 4>. Arthrodia, in which the plane, or almost plane, surfaces of bones are opposed to each other; in this form of joint but little motion is allowed; as is seen in the transverse processes of the ver- tebrae, and the carpal and tarsal articulations. 3. AMPHIARTHROSIS. This genus of articulation is intermediate between the other two, the union between the bones being ac- complished by the interposition of a thick plate of car- tilage or fibro cartilage, assisted by ligaments which pass from one bone to another. It is seen in the arti- culations of the bodies of the vertebra with each other, and the ossa ilia with the sacrum. It has no subdivision.

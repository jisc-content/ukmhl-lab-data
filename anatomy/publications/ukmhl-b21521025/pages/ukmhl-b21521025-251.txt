CERVICAL PORTION OP SYMPATHETIC. 231 5. The Otic or Arnold's Ganglion is found under the base of the skull, between the foramen ovale and the origin of the circumflexor palati muscle. CERVICAL PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC. The Cervical Ganglia are three in number on each side of the neck; the superior, the middle, and the inferior. The Superior Ganglion is of a long, oval figure, and is placed behind the internal carotid artery, the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumo-gastric, spinal-accessory, and lingual nerves, with all which it is very intimately connected; it lies upon the rectus capitis anticus major muscle, and extends over the second vertebra. The branches arising from it are classed into superior, internal, external, anterior, and inferior. 1. Superior Branches, which generally consist of two or three twigs; they mount upon the carotid artery into the cranium. 2. Internal Branches, these are numerous; they enter into the pharyngeal plexus, which they assist in forming, and one or two join the superior laryn- geal nerve. 3. External Branches, which join the superior cervical nerves.

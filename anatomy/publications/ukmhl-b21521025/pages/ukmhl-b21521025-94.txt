74 MUSCLES OP BACK. their insertion that they can be distinguished into sepa- rate muscles; the origin is from the side and spinous processes of the sacrum, from the transverse and spi- nous processes of the lumbar vertebra;, and from the sacro-iliac ligament and posterior part of the crista ilii. The sacro-lumbalis is inserted into all the ribs near their angles: from the six or seven inferior ribs small muscular fasciculi arise, which terminate in the inner side of this muscle, (the musculi accessorii). The longissimus dorsi is inserted into all the ribs near the tubercles, and also into the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebra;. The Spinalis Dorsi arises from the spinous pro- cesses of the two upper lumbar, and three lower dorsal vertebrae; it is inserted into the spinous processes of the eight or nine superior dorsal vertebra;. The Cebvicalis Ascendens arises from the four or five superior ribs, between their tubercles and angles; it is inserted into the transverse processes of the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae. The Tbansvebsalis Colli arises from the five superior dorsal transverse processes ; it is inserted into the four or five inferior cervical transverse pro- cesses. The Tbachelo Mastoideus arises from the trans- verse processes of the four inferior cervical, and three or four superior dorsal vertebra;; it is inserted into the back part of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. The Complexus arises from the articular and

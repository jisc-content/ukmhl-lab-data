THYROID AND LINGUAL ARTERIES. 151 3. Ascending Set. Arteria Pharyngea Ascendens, Arteria Temporalis Superficialis, Arteria Maxillaris Interna. The transverse facial is frequently classed as one of the ascending branches of the external carotid, making- the tenth branch, but as it is as often given off by the temporal, I prefer the above enumeration as quite correct, and more easily recollected. The Anterior set of Branches are considerable trunks. 1. The Superior Thyroideal Artery gives off four branches. 1. Ramus Hyoideus, 2. Ramus Superficialis, 3. Ramus Laryngeus, 4. Ramus Thyroideus. 2. The Lingual Artery gives off four branches. 1. Ramus Hyoideus, 2. Arteria Dorsalis Linguae, 3. Arteria Sublingualis, 4-. Arteria Ranina.

150 EXTERNAL CAROTID. EXTERNAL CAROTID. This is more superficial and rather smaller than the internal carotid artery. It passes upwards, at first inclining inwards and then backwards, into the sub- stance of the parotid gland; where, mid-way between the angle of the jaw and zygomatic process, it divides into the temporal and internal maxillary arteries. The external carotid is covered by the integu- ments, the platysma, the cervical fasciae, the lin- gual nerve, the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, and near its termination by the portia dura. It lies upon the pharyngeal plexus and glosso-pha- ryngeal nerves, the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyn- geus muscles, and upon part of the parotid gland, by all which parts it is also separated from the internal carotid artery. The branches of the external carotid are nine in number; they are divided into three sets; each set contains three branches. 1. Anterior Set. Arteria Thyroidea Superior, Arteria Lingualis, Arteria Facialis vel Labialis. 2. External Set. Arteria Muscularis vel Sterno-mastoidea, Arteria Occipitalis, Arteria Posterior Auris.

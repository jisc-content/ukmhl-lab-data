233 CARDIAC NERVES AND PLEXUS. 2. Internal Branches ; these join the pneumo- gastric and recurrent laryngeal nerves. 3. External Branches, some of which form a plexus round the subclavian artery, others, which join the inferior cervical nerves. 4. Inferior Branches, which join the first thoracic- ganglion. 5. Inferior Cardiac Nerves. CARDIAC NERVES AND PLEXUS. The three cardiac nerves are not of equal size on each side the body. The right middle cardiac is usually the largest of the nerves, while that of the left side is often small or wanting; on the contrary, the inferior left is considerable, and the inferior right small. These nerves all descend into the chest and form a most intricate net-work, which is consider- ably increased by branches from the pneumo-gastric and recurrent laryngeal nerves. The filaments pass along the three great arteries to the arch of the aorta; most of them posterior to the vessel, between it and the bifurcation of the trachea, to join the posterior cardiac plexus. A small number of filaments pass anterior to the aorta; these constitute the Anterior Cardiac Plexus. The Posterior Cardiac Plexus or Ganglion is placed between the aorta, the right pulmonary artery, x 3

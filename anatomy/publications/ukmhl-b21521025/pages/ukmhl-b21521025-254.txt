234 THORACIC PORTION OF SYMPATHETIC. and the trachea; it forms a most complicated web, which is increased by branches from the superior tho- racic ganglion and the pulmonary plexuses; within the meshes of this web several minute ganglia are enclosed. From the cardiac plexus very many branches pass with the coronary arteries to the ven- tricles, others upon the cava to the auricles, some accompany the pulmonary arteries to the lungs, and others mount upon the aorta and ductus arte- riosus. THORACIC PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC. The Sympathetic, in the chest, consists of a chain of eleven or twelve ganglia on each side of the ver- tebral column, situated either upon, or between the heads of the ribs; they are covered by the pleura, being just external to the posterior mediastinum. Sometimes the last cervical and first thoracic ganglia are confounded together; the ganglia are connected by one or two filaments. From each, two or three branches pass outwards to join the spinal nerves, and other small branches pass inwards, across the ver- tebral column, from whence filaments enter the pul- monary and cardiac plexuses, and others accompany the aorta and oesophagus. Two important nerves arise on each side from the thoracic ganglia,â€”the greater and smaller splanchnic nerves.

134 FASCIAE OP AN APONEUROTIC CHARACTER. as from the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and coraco-brachialis, particularly the latter. On each side of the arm it is closely connected with the con- dyloid ridges, thus forming the inter-muscular septa ; as it passes over the condyles on to the fore-arm, it is attached to them as well as to the olecranon process; posteriorly, it is strengthened from the insertion of the triceps ; anteriorly, it receives a remarkable process from the tendon of the biceps, called, from its shape, the falciform process. This process, which passes upwards and inwards, and is connected with the inner condyle as well as with the fascia of the fore-arm, separates the median basilic vein from the lower part of the brachial artery. The Fascia of the fore-arm not only closely invests the muscles but sends down between them (particularly on the anterior surface) very strong inter-muscular septa, from which they in part arise ; it is also connected to the edges of the radius and ulna; above it is continuous with the fascia of the arm, below it is inserted into the annular ligaments of the wrist. The Posterior Annular Ligament consists of a transverse band of fibres, which passes across the extensor tendons, between the styloid processes of the radius and ulna; from its digital edge a thin broad expansion passes over the extensor tendons, and is lost upon the phalanges. The Anterior Annular Ligament is a very strong, dense fibrous structure, which binds down

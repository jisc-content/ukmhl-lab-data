INOSCULATION OP ARTERIES. 182 rior mesenteric artery, without death being the con- sequence, but below this point it appears to be by no means an impossibility to place a ligature round the aorta, and the circulation in the inferior extremi- ties still go on.* If the Aorta be obliterated below the inferior mesenteric artery, the blood will flow into the iliacs, by the chain of inosculations upon the abdominal and pelvic viscera, through the ramifications of the superior and inferior mesenteric, particularly the latter, and the spermatic arteries, with the visceral branches of the internal iliacs : by the lumbar arte- ries with the ilio lumbar, circumflex ilii, and gluteal arteries: and by the internal epigastric with the internal mammary from the subclavian. Should the Common or Internal Iliac be tied in addition to the branches mentioned above, the flow of * On the 11th of August, 1834, I tied the right femoral artery in a young dog; on the 15th, the left common carotid; on the 19th, the right axillary; on the 22nd, the left external iliac; on the 26th, the right carotid low down; on the 1st of September, the left brachial; on the 9th, not being quite satisfied that I had secured the right carotid, I tied it again high up; on the 16th the aorta was tied, just above its bifurcation. After more than a year from this time the dog was killed; unfortunately the person who undertook to inject it, neglected to immerse the body in warm water, so that the wax was scarcely forced into any of the vessels; this was not discovered until after it was too late to be remedied; it was, however, found on careful examination, that all the ligaturee had been properly and securely placed.

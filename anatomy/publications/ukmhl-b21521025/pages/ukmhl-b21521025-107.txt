87 SUPERFICIAL ABDOMINAL MUSCLES. pubis. Poupart's ligament is formed by the inferior cord-like boundary of the tendon of the external oblique muscle, and extends from the superior ante- rior spine of the ilium to the pubis. The Obliquus Intebnus arises from the lumbar vertebrae by the fascia lumborum, from nearly the whole of the crista ilii, and from the external half, or rather more, of poupart's ligament; it is inserted into the cartilages of the seven inferior ribs, into the ensiform cartilage, into the whole of the linea alba, and with the transversalis into the pubis. The Cbemasteb arises from poupart's ligament, and appears like a few fibres given off from the lower edge of the internal oblique; it is inserted into the tunica vaginalis. The Tbansvebsalis arises from the lumbar ver- tebrae by the fascia lumborum, from the inner surface of the six inferior ribs, from nearly the whole of the inner lip of the crista ilii, and from the outer half of poupart's ligament; it is inserted with the posterior layer of the tendon of the internal oblique, which it joins at the linea semilunaris, into the whole length of the linea alba, from the ensiform cartilage to the pubis, and also into the linea ilio-pectinea. From the ensiform cartilage to mid-way between the umbilicus and pubis, the rectus is enclosed in the combined tendons of the internal oblique and trans- versalis, one layer passing before, the other behind the rectus; below this point the whole tendon passes anterior to the rectus.

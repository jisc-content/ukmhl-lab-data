208 GLOSSO-PHARYNGEAL NERVE. 2. Superior Facial, 3. Middle Facial. The Cervico-facial twigs are the 1. Inferior Facial, 2. Sub-maxillary. 3. Cervical. 9. GLOSSO-PHARYNGEAL NERVE. This is connected, by three or four filaments, with the same tract as the facial nerve, below it, between the olivary and restiform bodies; it leaves the skull through the posterior lacerated opening, and passes down anterior to the jugular vein and the internal carotid artery, between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscles, to the side and base of the tongue. In this course the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, on leaving the cranium, sends two or three small twigs into the temporal bone; it is then inti- mately connected with the facial, pneumo-gastric, and sympathetic nerves ; as it passes inwards, be- tween the internal and external carotids, it gives off many filaments, which, uniting with the pharyn- geal branch of the pneumo-gastric, constitute the Pharyngeal Plexus. The nerve terminates by its branches supplying the muscles and mucous mem- brane of the root of the tongue, the fauces, and the pharynx.

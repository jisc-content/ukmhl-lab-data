212 SPINAL NERVES. The lingual nerve on the fore part of the neck sends off the Descendens Noni and the Thyro- hyoideal branch: the latter is small; the former passes down the neck upon the carotid sheath ; at first it lies upon its outer side, then upon the inner; it receives some filaments from the pneumo- gastric and cervical plexus ; it is distributed to the omo-hyoideus, sterno-hyoideus, and stemo-thyroi- deus muscles. SPINAL NERVES. There are thirty pairs of spinal nerves, beside the accessory, each of which is connected to the spinal marrow by a double attachment,â€”the Anterior or Motor filaments, and the Posterior or Sensatory fila- ments. The motor filaments are smaller than the sensatory. They are connected with the anterior or motor tract of the spinal marrow at the antero-late- ral fissure ; this corresponds with the anterior heirs; of the crescentic-shaped cineritious matter, which is contained within the external white fibrous portion of the medulla spinalis. The sensatory filaments are the larger, and are connected with the posterior or sensatory tract at the posterior lateral fissure, which corresponds with the posterior horn of the crescentic- shaped mass. The ligamentum dentatum is placed between the anterior and posterior filaments; these

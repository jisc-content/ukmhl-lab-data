ABDUCENT NERVE. 204 immediately subdivides into four sets of twigs; the Deep Temporal, the Masseteric, the Buccal, and the Pterygoid. These twigs are accompanied by the second set of branches from the internal maxillary artery. 2. The Internal is by far the larger portion, and subdivides into three branches; 1st. The Auricular Nerve; 2nd. The Inferior Dental Nerve, which as it enters the posterior mental foramen gives off a branch to the mylo-hyoideus ; part of this nerve escapes by the mental foramen, between the de- pressor anguli oris and the depressor labii inferioris ; 3. The Gustatory Nerve for the tongue. 6. ABDUCENT NERVE. This nerve is connected with the corpus pyra- midale, immediately behind the pons Varolii; it passes through the cavernous sinus, to enter the orbit, between the two heads of the external rectus muscle, to the ocular surface of which, after giving a filament to the lenticular ganglion, it is distributed. POSITION OF THE NERVES IN THE CAVERNOUS SINUS. If we take the middle of the cavernous sinus, the position of the four nerves which pass through it, is this, remembering that all of them are external

ABDOMINAL AORTA. 166 contained within the posterior mediastinum, is called the Aorta Thoracica; at the upper part, it is to the left of the vertebrae, but at the lower, where it passes between the crura of the diaphragm, it lies in the median line. To the right of the artery are placed the thoracic duct and the vena azygos ; and before it, the left bronchial tube, the root of the left lung, the aesophagus, and the pericardium with the base of the heart. The branches of the thoracic aorta, though nume- rous are not large; they may be divided into two sets, a posterior or parietal, and an anterior or visceral. The Posterior Set are the ARTERiiE Intercostales Inperiores ; of which there are generally nine on the right side, and ten upon the left. The Anterior Set are the 1. Arteri^; Bronchiales, which are generally four in number; 2. Arteri^e iEsopHAGEALEs: these are very un- certain in number, and vary from one to six. ABDOMINAL AORTA. The opening between the crura of the diaphragm is considerably larger than the aorta itself, so that no compression can take place ; the thoracic duct and

CERVICAL PLEXUS. 215 The branches arising from the plexus are divided into an ascending and a descending set. The Ascending Set turn over the posterior edge of the stemo-mastoid muscle, and pass obliquely upwards; three of them are distinguished by names. 1. The Auricular Branch or Ascendens Colli, accompanies the external jugular vein to the parotid gland. 2. The Transverse or Superficial Cervical, passes towards the chin, and joins with the submaxillary branches of the facial. 3. The Small Occipital ascends towards the mas- toid process. The Descending branches from the cervical plexus are several, and may be divided into a deep and superficial set; the latter are called from their direction, 1. Supra-clavicular Twigs, 2. Supra-acromial Twigs, 3. Sub-clavicular Twigs. The deep, are two important nerves, which pass from the lower portion of the plexus, chiefly, but not entirely, from^ the fourth cervical nerve. 1. The External Respiratory Nerve, which is distributed almost exclusively to the serratus mag- nns. 2. The Internal Respiratory or Phrenic Nerve, which descends upon the scalenus anticus, and enters

The Mylo Hyoideus arises from the mylo-hyoid ridge on the inferior maxilla, extending from the last molar tooth to the symphysis; it is inserted into the body of the os hyoides, and into the median apo- neurotic line (formed by the union of the opposite muscles) which extends from the symphysis menti to the os hyoides. The Genio Hyoideus arises from the inferior tubercle on the inner side of the symphysis, above the insertion of the digastricus; it is inserted into the body of the os hyoides. The Hyo Glossus arises from the greater cornu and part of the body of the os hyoides ; it is inserter/ into the side of the tongue, forming part of its sub- stance. The Genio Hyo Glossus arises from the sym- physis menti under the frenum linguae ; it is inserted into the median line of the tongue, from the tip to the base, and into the os hyoides. The Lingualis consists of a series of muscular fibres which run along the whole length of the tongue, forming part of its substance; they are placed between the genio-hyo-glossus and the hyo-glossus. The Stylo Hyoideus arises from the outer side of the base of the styloid process; it is inserted into the greater cornu and body of the os hyoides.

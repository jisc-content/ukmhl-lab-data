ARTICULATIONS OF STERNUM AND CLAVICLE. +1 The Ligamentum Arcuatum is a ligamentous band, which proceeds from the transverse processes of the first and second lumbar vertebrae to the inferior edge of the first rib j by some anatomists this is called the false ligamentum arcuatum, and the term true, given to some ligamentous fibres which extend from the transverse process of the first, to the body of the second lumbar vertebra. STERNAL ARTICULATIONS. The anterior and posterior ligaments which con- nect the ribs with the sternum, form a fibrous envelope for it; but in addition to these, the three bones of which in the adult it is composed, are connected together by two series of longitudinal fibres called from their situation theâ€” 1. Proper Posterior Ligament of the Sternum. 2. Proper Anterior Ligament of the Sternum. STERNO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION. This articulation is formed by the inner extre- mity of the clavicle and the first bone of the sternum; in this joint there is an inter-articular cartilage, two synovial sacs, and four ligaments. 1. and 2. The Anterior and Posterior Ligaments, run from the clavicle to the sternum, the one on the e 3

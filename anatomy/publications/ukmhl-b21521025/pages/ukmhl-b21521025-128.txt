108 CLASSIFICATION OF MUSCLES MUSCLES OF THE OS HYOIDES,—NINE. Levators,—-five. Digastricus, Stylo-hyoideus, Mylo-hyoideus, Genio-hyoideus, Genio-hyo-glossus. Depressors,—four. Sterno-hyoideus, Sterno-thyroideus, Thyro-hyoideus, Omo-hyoideus. The depressors of the os hyoides are important in the motions of the lower jaw, by fixing the os hyoides, they afford a firm point for the action of the muscles between it and the jaw. Deglutition is accomplished by the combined action of the muscles of the tongue, palate, os hyoides, and pharynx. MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX, FIVE. Dilators of the Rima Glottidis,—two.

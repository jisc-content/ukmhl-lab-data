This nerve passes out of the pelvis beneath the pyriformis muscle, and is principally distributed to the greater glutaeus muscle. 7. PUDIC NERVE. The pudic escapes with the last, but immedi- ately passes round the spine of the ischium, and re- enters the pelvis through the smaller notch. It divides into two branches; the Inferior pierces the obturator fascia, and is distributed to the muscles of the perinseum ; the Superior pierces the sus- pensory ligament, and passes on to the dorsum of the penis, along which it runs to the glands. 8. POSTERIOR CUTANEOUS NERVE. This escapes from the pelvis with the two last nerves, and descends under the integuments to the ham and calf of the leg. 9. GREAT SCIATIC NERVE. The sciatic is by far the largest nerve in the body; it arises from all the sacral nerves, and

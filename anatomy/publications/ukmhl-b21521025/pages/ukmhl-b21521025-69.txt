49 ARTICULATIONS OF PELVIS. ARTICULATION OF THE PHALANGES WITH THE META- CARPAL BONES, AND WITH EACH OTHER. The articulation between the head of the meta- carpal bone and the first phalanx, and between each of the phalanges, is similar: into each joint there enters a synovial sac, and three ligaments which form an imperfect capsular ligament. 1. The Anterior Ligament is a half annular liga- ment, it covers the fore part and sides of the joint. 2. and 3. The two Lateral Ligaments extend on either side, from one bone to the other. LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. The ligaments of the pelvis may be arranged into four sets:—1st. Those which connect the Pelvis with the Vertebrae: 2. Those which connect the Sacrum and Os Coccygis: 3. Those which unite the Sacrum with the Ossa Ilia: 4. Those which unite the Pubes. The sacrum is connected to the last lumbar ver- tebra by all the ligaments which are common to the vertebral column, as the anterior and posterior, the crucial, the articular, the inter-transverse, and inter- spinous, the ligamentum subflavum, and the inter- vertebral substance; also by two other ligaments which are proper to it and the ilium, viz :— r

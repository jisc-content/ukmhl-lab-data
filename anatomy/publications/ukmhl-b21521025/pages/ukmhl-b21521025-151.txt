FASCIjE of an aponeurotic character. 131 1â€”FASCIA INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH, AND PRINCIPALLY DERIVED FROM, MUSCLES. Many of these deep fasciae are very strong, and generally present a more distinct and aponeurotic character than the superficial; for the most part they are intimately attached to the projecting pro- cesses of bones, and apparently are derived from the tendinous origins and insertions of the muscles which they cover, or assist in giving origin to. The Ligamentum Nuch^i is scarcely to be regarded as a fascia, it consists of a band of elastic fibres, attached superiorly to the occipital protube- rance, and extends inferiorly to the spinous process of the sixth or seventh cervical vertebra, forming a division between the muscles of the two sides; continuous with the inferior end of the ligamentum nuchse is the cervical aponeurosis, a thin layer of fibres of an oval form, stretched between the supe- rior angles of the two scapulae, and extending from about the fifth cervical to the fifth dorsal vertebra. The Fascia Lumborum is a very strong, impor- tant fascia; it may be described as consisting of three layers, which can be traced backwards from the internal oblique and transverse abdominal muscles. The inner layer assists in giving origin to the trans-

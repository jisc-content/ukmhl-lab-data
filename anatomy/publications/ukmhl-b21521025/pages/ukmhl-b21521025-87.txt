MUSCLES OF PALATE AND PHARYNX. 67 The Stylo Glossus arises from the apex of the styloid process, and from the stylo-maxillary liga- ment ; it is inserted along the side of the tongue. The Stylo Pharyngeus arises from the base of the styloid process; it is inserted into the thyroid cartilage, and into the side of the pharynx with the middle constrictor. MUSCLES OP THE PALATE AND PHARYNX,â€”EIGHT PAIRS. 1. Levator Palati, 2. Tensor vel Circumflexus Palati, 3. Motor vel Azygos Uvulae, 4. Palato Glossus, 5. Palato Pharyngeus, 6. Constrictor Pharyngis Inferior, 7. Constrictor Pharyngis Medius, 8. Constrictor Pharyngis Superior. The Levator Palati arises from the petrous bone, in front of the carotid foramen ; it is inserted into the velum palati. The Tensor Palati arises from the spine of the sphenoid bone, from the fossa navicularis, and from the eustachian tube; it winds round the hamular process: by expanding, it forms with the opposite muscle the aponeurotic fibres of the velum palati, which are attached to the posterior edge of the palate bone.

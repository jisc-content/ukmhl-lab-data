Coccygeus.* The Sphincter Ani Externus surrounds the anus as an orbicular muscle; it arises from the apex of the coccyx, and is inserted into the common tendinous point of the perinseum, and into the integuments. The Sphincter Ani Internus surrounds the lower end of the rectum, and consists of the cir- cular fibres of the gut more developed than they are above. The Erector Penis arises from the inner surface of the tuber ischii; it is inserted into the fibrous mem- brane of the corpus cavernosum. The Accelerator Urin^; arises, in common with that of the opposite side, from the median fine under the bulb of the urethra, from whence the fibres pro- ceed in three directions. The posterior pass outwards to be inserted into the triangular ligament near to the ramus of the pubis ; the middle fibres pass round the urethra on to its upper surface, to join with those of *A few fibres, which are attached to the descending ramus of the pubis above the erector penis, pass upwards and inwards over the root of the penis, and unite under the symphysis in a common tendon with the corresponding muscle of the opposite side; this tendon, from its position, can compress the dorsal vein; the fibres have recently been described as a distinct muscle, under the name of Compressor Venae Dorsalis Penis.

207 FACIAL NERVE. form bodies, immediately below the inferior edge of the pons; it accompanies the auditory nerve into the internal foramen, but soon separates from it to pass along the canal of Fallopius, which opens externally at the stylo-mastoid foramen; its passage through the petrous bone is very tortuous, to avoid the organ of hearing; it is, while within this canal, that it receives, and again gives off, the vidian or chorda tympani nerve. The facial nerve sends off many branches. While behind the tympanum., two or three minute twigs pass to the small muscles of the ear ; on escaping from the stylo-mastoid fora- men three branches are given off. 1. Posterior Auricular Nerve, 2. Stylo-hyoid Nerve, 3. Sub-mastoid or Digastric Nerve. The Facial trunk then enters the parotid gland, passes over the external carotid artery, and over the angle of the jaw ; it divides into two branches, an upper or Temporo-facial, and a lower or Cervico- facial, each of which subdivides into three sets of twigs; all these, however, unite so frequently upon the face as to form a complete plexus,â€”the Paro- tidean or Pes Anserinus. These twigs of the facial freely communicate with the three divisions of the fifth nerve. The Temporo-facial twigs are the 1. Temporal,

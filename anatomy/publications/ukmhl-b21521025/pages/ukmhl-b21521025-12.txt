PREFACE. viii. understand the muscular system well is consider- ably more difficult than any other part of anatomy; it, however, repays any application, not only on account of its own importance, but also, because this understood, the course and distribution of the Blood Vessels and Nerves are most easily compre- hended. Though this book is more particularly intended for those who have paid some degree of attention to anatomy, it is not improbable that the student who is about entering upon the study might find it useful as an introduction; and it is thought, in the dissecting room it may be consulted not with- out advantage, by impressing the dissections in a clearer and more definitive manner upon the memory. Lengthened descriptions of the connec- tions and relative anatomy of parts under dissection are much better fitted for study at home, than by, the dissecting table, where the subject itself should be considered, whereas short references are not onby useful, but often absolutely necessary to assist the memory at the moment, respecting the part under the eye.

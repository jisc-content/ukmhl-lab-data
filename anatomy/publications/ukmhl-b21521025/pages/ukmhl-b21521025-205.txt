SINUSES OF BRAIN. 185 SINUSES OF THE BRAIN. The veins of the brain do not accompany the arteries, but are enclosed between the layers of the dura mater, and are called sinuses ; they are fifteen in number. The Superior and Inferior Longitudinal Sinuses; the first is much the larger; it commences at the crista galli, and runs along the convex edge of the falx major ; the latter passes along its concave edge, and opens into the straight sinus. The Straight Sinus is formed by the inferior longitudinal sinus, and the veins of Galen which return the blood from the inner surface of the brain; it runs upon the tentorium between the layers of the base of the falx major. The Two Cerebellic Sinuses run in the margins of the falx minor. The Two Large Lateral Sinuses are situated at the convex margin of the tentorium. The Two Cavernous Sinuses are placed at the side of the sella turcica; they commence from the ophthalmic veins, and open into the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses on each side. The Circular Sinus connects the two cavernous sinuses. The Petrosal Sinuses consist of a superior and an inferior on each side the cranium ; they commence at the apex of the petrosal bone, from the termination of the cavernous sinus ; the superior runs along its r 3

132 FASCIAE OF AN APONEUROTIC CHARACTER. versalis muscle; it passes anterior to the quadratus lumborum, to be attached to the bodies of the lum- bar vertebrae, and is there connected with the fascia iliaca. The second layer of the fascia assists in giving origin to the internal oblique muscle; it is attached to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, posterior to the quadratus lumborum. The third portion of the lumbar fascia is by far the strongest, it gives origin to the latissimus dorsi and serratus posticus inferior, and is separated by the long lumbar muscles from the second layer ; it is attached to the spinous processes of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, and externally to the abdo- minal muscles and crista ilii. The Deep Cervical Fascia does not cover the platysma myoides or trapezius; it arises from the ligamentum nucha? and cervical spinous processes, under the trapezius, and over the splenius and leva- tor anguli scapulae, which it binds down as it passe? forwards to the posterior edge of the stemo-mastoi- deus, where it is split into two layers, to enclose this muscle and the omo-hyoideus. The anterior layer passes before the two muscles, while the posterior passes behind them over the carotid sheath, to which it is connected ; at the anterior edge of the sterno- mastoideus, in the middle of the neck, the two layers join, and on the median line over the trachaea, become continuous with the fascia of the opposite side. At the lower part of the neck the superficial

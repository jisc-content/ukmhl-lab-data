196 CEREBRAL NERVES. commonly divided into those attached to the brain, and those attached to the spinal marrow. CEREBRAL NERVES. Some authors speak of nine, others of eleven or twelve pairs of cerebral nerves, all understanding the same nerves, but adopting a different numerical clas- sification ; the latter I consider more correct. Nine pairs, (commencing anteriorly). 1. Olfactory, 2. Optic, 3. Common Motor Nerve of the Eye, L. Trochleator or Pathetic, 5. Trifacial or Trigeminal, 6. Abducent, or External Motor of the Eye, 7. Portio Dura or Facial, and the Portio Mollis or Auditory Nerve, 8. Glosso Pharyngeal, Pneumo Gastric, and Spi- nal Accessory, 9. Lingual or Hypo-Glossal. sions, and simply to state facts as briefly as possible, I give the attachment of nerves as usually found in recent anatomical works, and which are very evident to the eye, although, from investiga- tions in which I have been long engaged, and from the late work of Mr. Solly, I am convinced that the nervous fibrilai may be traced much farther into the central masses than is generally supposed.

SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 158 The right subclavian passes upwards and out- wards, behind the scalenus anticus muscle, then bending downwards, it passes over the first rib, under the clavicle and subclavius muscle, into the axillary space ; in this course the vessel forms a convexity which looks upwards, a concavity which looks down- wards and embraces the apex of the pleura, upon which it lies. The course of the subclavian artery is usually divided into three stages—1st. Between its origin and the innez edge of the scalenus anti- cus muscle; 2nd. While behind the scalenus; 3rd. From the outer side of the scalenus to the edge of the first rib. In its first stage it has behind it, the sympathetic and the recurrent laryngeal nerves, some lymphatic glands, and the longus colli muscle. It is covered by the sterno-mastoid, hyoid, and thyroid muscles, the par vagum, and some branches of the sympa- thetic nerves, the internal jugular and vertebral veins, and by a strong fascia, which extends from the arteria innominata to the scalenus anticus,—a continuation of the deep cervical fascia. In the second stage it lies upon the pleura and middle sca- lenus, and is covered by the platysma, the cervical fascise, the clavicular portion of the sterno-mastoi- deus, and the scalenus anticus muscles, the last of these separates the artery from the subclavian vein and the phrenic nerve. In its third stage it lies upon the middle scalenus and first rib, and is covered by the platysma myoides, both cervical fasciae, some

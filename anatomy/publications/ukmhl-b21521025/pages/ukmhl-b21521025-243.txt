LUMBAR PLEXUS, AND ITS BRANCHES. 223 and one long branch, the External Spermatic, to the spermatic cord and scrotum. The Middle Branch passes along the outer side of the psoas muscle to the superior anterior spinous process of the ilium, where it passes under the crural arch, and is dis- tributed to the integuments of the thigh. The Third or Internal Branch, near poupart's ligament, divides into two twigs : one passes to the thigh exactly over the femoral vessels, the other accom- panies the spermatic vessels to the cord. 2. ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE. This nerve is of very great size ; it arises from the four superior lumbar nerves, and passes down- wards, on the outer side of the psoas muscle, between it and the iliacus, and under the fascia iliaca; as it passes beneath poupart's ligament it is about one inch and a half to the outer side of the artery ; it divides in the groin into many branches, which are classed into a Superficial and a Deep Set, and supply the muscles of the thigh. One of the latter branches descends with the vessels as far as the opening in the abductor magnus tendon ; it then passes between the gracilis and sartorius, over the inner condyle of the knee, and accompanies the saphena vein down the leg, as far as the inner side of the foot, it is called the Internal Saphenus Nerve.

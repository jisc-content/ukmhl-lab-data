172 INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. 1. The Obturator Artery gives off within the pelvis several small branches, and having escaped through the foramen of the same name, divides into an Anterior or Internal, and into a Posterior or External Branch. 2. The Gluteal Artery is the largest branch of the internal iliac, it escapes through the upper part of the gluteal notch accompanied by the supe- rior gluteal nerve, and divides into a smaller or Superficial Branch, and a larger or Deep Branch, which again, but particularly the latter, subdivide into many branches to supply the glutaei muscles. 3. The Ischiadic Artery escapes from the pelvis with the pudic, between the pyriformis and the levator ani muscles; it divides into three branches. 1. Arteria Coccygea, 2. Arteria Comes Nevi Ischiadici, 3. Rami Musculares. 4. The Internal Pudic Artery escapes with the ischiadic through the lower part of the great sciatic notch, and again re-enters the pelvis through the smaller, as the obturator is passing out; this latter

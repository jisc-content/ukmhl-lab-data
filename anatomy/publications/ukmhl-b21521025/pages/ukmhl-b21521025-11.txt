PREFACE. vii. arise that a small work would be referred to, when a large work could or would not be consulted; and there are many spare minutes (as between lectures, &c.) which might often be profitably employed by the practice of carrying such hooks as may readily be consulted, especially such as contain facts, where no lengthened train of reasoning is required, which must necessarily be destroyed by broken and in- terrupted applications. It is for this reason that, the Viscera are not introduced ; any description of them, to be useful, must be of considerable length, as their importance depends, not so much upon mere outward forms, as upon their minute texture and relative connections.

VEINS. The venous system consists of four sets of vessels ; 1st. The Deep, which accompany the arteries; 2nd. The Superficial, which run immediately beneath the skin ; 3rd. The Sinuses of the Brain ; and, 4th. The Portal System: all which ultimately open into the two venffi cavse. The deep veins of the head and neck, the vena azygos, the pelvic veins, and the branches of the portal system, are not furnished with valves; the other veins contain many, particularly those of the extremities. DEEP VEINS. All the arteries of large size, as the axillary, carotid, femoral, &c, are accompanied by a single vein, while the smaller arteries have two veins each ; the course of them is identical with that of the cor- responding arteries.

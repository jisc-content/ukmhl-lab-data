BLOOD VESSELS. ARTERIES. The heart is the centre of the circulatory system, since from it the arteries commence, and at it the veins terminate. It is placed in an oblique posi- tion, to the left of the median line. The base is backwards, upwards, and towards the right side, nearly opposite to the fourth dorsal vertebra; the apex, which is downwards, forwards, and towards the left, corresponds to the intercostal space between the fifth and sixth ribs. Of the eight vessels connected with the heart, six are veins, and two are arteries: of these, five—the pulmonary artery, and the four pulmonary veins, belong to the lesser or pulmonic circulation; three—the aorta and two venae cavse, to the larger or systematic circulation. Three vessels, besides the small cardiac vein, are connected with the right side of the heart, the two cavse open into the auricle ; the pulmonary artery arises from the ventricle. With the left side, five vessels are connected, the four pul- monary veins open into the auricle; the aorta arises from the ventricle. The right or anterior side of the to

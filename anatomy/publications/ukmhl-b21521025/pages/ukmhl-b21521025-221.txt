SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. 201 vernous sinus, to enter the orbit by the lacerated opening-; just before entering the orbit it divides into three branches, 1. Frontal Nerve, 2. Lachrymal Nerve, 3. Nasal Nerve. The Frontal Nerve subdivides into two twigs, the Supra-trochlear, and the Supra-orbital nerves. The Lachrymal Nerve gives off a small twig, which passes through the spheno-maxillary fissure, to join the second division of the fifth; it sends a second twig through the malar bone, which joins the facial; after this the nerve terminates in the lachry- mal gland, in the conjunctiva, and in the eye-lids. The Nasal Nerve divides into four twigs, one to the Lenticular Ganglion; one or two Ciliary nerves, the Infra-trochlear branch, and the Proper Nasal nerve. 2nd Division. The Superior Maxillary Nerve escapes from the cranium, through the foramen rotundum into the spheno-maxillary fossa, where it sends off a small twig into the orbit, through the spheno-maxillary fissure, and then it divides into three portions. 1.

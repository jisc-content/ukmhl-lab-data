149 COMMON CAROTID. COMMON CAROTID. The two common carotid arteries differ from each other at their origin, in other respects they are similar. The right, arising from the innominata opposite to the sterno-clavicular articulation, is not within the chest. The left, arising from the arch of the aorta, is at first within the thorax, and is covered by the sternum, the left vena innominata, and the remains of the thymus gland ; it lies upon the tra- chaea, the sesophagus, and the thoracic duct. The carotids pass up to the space between the cornu of the os hyoides and thyroid cartilage, or to about the third cervical vertebra, where they divide into the external and internal carotids. In this course no branches are usually given off by them. The artery is enclosed in a sheath with the jugular vein and par vagum nerve, the vein lies to the outer side, the nerve between and posterior to the artery and vein. The sheath of the vessel lies upon the cervical vertebrae, the rectus capitis anticus major and longus colli muscles, the sympathetic and recurrent nerves, and the inferior thyroid artery; it is covered by the integuments, the platysma myoides, sterno-mastoid, hyoid, thyroid, and omo-hyoid muscles, with the cervical fasciae. The descendens noni passes down upon the sheath; above this nerve lies on its outer side, below on its inner. o 3

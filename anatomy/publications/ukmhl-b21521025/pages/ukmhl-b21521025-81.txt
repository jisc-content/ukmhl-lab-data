MUSCLES OF FACE. 61 canine fossa immediately below the infra-orbital foramen; it is inserted into the commissure of the lips. The Depressor Labii Superioris Al^que Nasi arises from the alveolar process of the upper jaw, above the canine and incisor teeth; it is inserted into the upper lip and into the cartilage of the nose. The Depressor Anguli Oris arises from the oblique line on the outer side of the lower jaw, between the masseter muscle and the mental foramen ; it is inserted into the commissure of the lips. The Depressor Labii Inferioris arises from the fore part of the inferior maxillary bone ; it is inserted into the under lip. The Levator Labii Inferioris arises from the alveolar process of the inferior maxillary bone near the symphysis; it is inserted into the integuments of the chin. The Buccinator arises from the alveoli of the molar teeth, both of the inferior and superior jaws, and also from the pterygo-maxillary ligament; (this ligament is a band of fibres which extends between the internal pterygoid process and the coronoid process) ; it is inserted into the commissure of the lips. The Orbicularis Oris consists of two fasciculi of fibres, one for each lip, which surround the opening of the mouth; they are completely blended with, and partly derived from, the other muscles which termi- nate in the lips.

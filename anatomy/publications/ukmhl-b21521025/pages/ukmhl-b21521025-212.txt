FOETAL CIRCULATION. It may be well to notice the chief peculiarities of the foetal circulation, which arise from the blood being neither formed nor aerated within the body of the child; but being conveyed from the mother by the umbilical vein, which enters through the umbilical opening, and passes along the falciform ligament of the liver to the horizontal fissure; where it gives off branches to the right and left lobes, but particularly to the latter, which at this period of life is of considerable size: having arrived at the transverse fissure it divides into two branches; the right one is the larger, and joins the vena portse, of which it makes a component part at this period of life. The left branch of the umbilical vein passes along the posterior portion of the longitudinal fis- sure, between the left and spigelean lobes, it consti- tutes the Ductus Venosus, and opens into the hepatic veins just as these are entering into the vena cava, where it meets that part of the blood which has circulated through the liver by the vena portse. Both vena cavse, as in the adult, open into the right auricle, which contracts and propels a portion

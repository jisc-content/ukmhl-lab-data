VEINS OF LOWER EXTREMITY. 188 to the origins of the three large arteries; having received several branches from the mediastinum and the thyroid gland, it joins the vein of the right side. The junction of the two venae innominatae is posterior to the cartilage of the first right rib, and forms the vena cava descendens. The Vena Cava Descendens very soon enters the pericardium, anterior to the root of the right lung, and after a short course opens into the right auricle; immediately as it enters the pericardium it receives the vena azygos, which winds round the root of the right lung. The Vena Azygos commences on the first lum- bar vertebra, passes through the aortic opening in the diaphragm, and conveys the blood which has circulated in the thoracic parietes. The principal superficial veins of the lower extre- mity are two, the greater and lesser saphena. The latter commences on the outer side of the dorsum of the foot, passes behind the outer ankle, and runs along the outer side of the leg to the popliteal space, where it opens into the popliteal vein. The greater saphena begins on the inner side of the foot, passes over the internal malleolus, and along the inner side of the leg, then behind the internal condyle, and mounts upon the inner and fore part of the thigh, to the saphenic opening in the fascia lata, where it joins the femoral vein.

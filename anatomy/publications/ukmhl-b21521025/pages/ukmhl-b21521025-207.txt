187 VEINS OP UPPER EXTREMITY. The superficial veins of the fore-arm are three, the Cephalic, the Basilic, and the Median. The Cephalic runs along the outer side of the fore-arm and arm to near the shoulder; it com- mences on the radial side of the dorsum of the hand, and between the great pectoral and deltoid muscles it joins the axillary vein. The Basilic Vein commences on the ulnar side of the fore-arm, along which it runs; it passes over the inner condyle, and ascends to the upper part of the arm, where it joins one of the deep brachial veins. The Median Vein commences in the palm of the hand; it runs upon the middle of the fore-arm to the bend of the elbow, where it divides into two branches, which join the other two veins (the median cephalic and median basilic) ; sometimes a third branch joins one of the deep veins. The Axillary Vein receives the veins which correspond to the arterial branches given off by the axillary artery ; it passes upwards, before the artery, and under the clavicle, where it is called Sub- clavian ; this is separated from the artery by the anterior scalenus muscle, and having received nume- rous branches, it forms, with the internal jugular, the vena innominata. The Vena Innominata on the right side is a short trunk: that on the left is much longer, and passes across the thorax, anterior to the trachea and

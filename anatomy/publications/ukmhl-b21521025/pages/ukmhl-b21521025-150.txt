SUPERFICIAL FASCIAE. 130 scrotum, from which, after giving it a covering, it is reflected posteriorly upon the perinaeum, forming the Superficial Fascia of the Perinceum. This peri- neal portion, on either side, is attached to the rami of the pubis and ischium, and is continuous with that covering the inner side of the thigh; while posteriorly, immediately behind the transversalis perinsei muscle, it passes above the superficial sphincter ani, and joins the deep fascia of the peri- naeum, and with it, is lost upon the rectum and the external surface of the levator ani. The Superficial Abdominal Fascia is then, external to the abdominal ring, intimately attached to the whole of poupart's ligament by a process which it sends to be connected with it, as the fascia itself is continued downwards on to the upper part of the thigh, where it assumes the name of Superficial Femoral Fascia, and becomes still thicker, so that it may be divided into several layers, between which are placed the superficial lymphatic glands; this fascia, on the outer and inner sides of the thigh, is separate and distinct from the fascia lata, but in the middle, over the vessels, it is very intimately connected with the fascia lata, and as it passes over the saphenic opening becomes almost identified with it. This part of the superficial fascia is called the Cribriform Fascia, on account of the numerous fora- mina in it for the transmission of blood vessels and lymphatics; lower on the thigh the fascia loses its character and becomes cellular.

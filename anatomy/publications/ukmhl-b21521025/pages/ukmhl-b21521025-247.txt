SACRAL PLEXUS AND ITS BRANCHES. 227 generally escapes from the pelvis below the pyri- formis muscle, but which it sometimes pierces. It lies upon the small rotator and the abductor magnus muscles; it is covered by the ham-string muscles and the fascia lata; at the lower part of the leg it divides into the Peroneal or External, and the Tibial or Internal Branches. The Peroneal is the smaller of the two nerves; it descends obliquely outwards, behind the external condyle, and winds round the head of the fibula, previous to which, it gives off the Posterior Cuta- neous branches : it then pierces the peronseus longus muscle, and divides into the Musculo-cutaneous, and Anterior Tibial nerves. The Musculo-cutaneous nerve passes downwards, between the peronseus longus and the extensor digi- torum communis; a little above the ankle it pierces the fascia, and divides into the External and Internal Tarsal nerves to supply the dorsum of the foot. The Anterior Tibial nerve passes down between the extensor communis and the tibialis anticus, and runs under the annular ligament to the tarsus, which, with the metatarsus, it assists in supplying; one branch passes as far as the two inner toes, and communicates with the plantar nerves. The Posterior Tibial nerve is the larger branch; it descends posterior to the poplitaeus muscle, where it gives off a cutaneous branch, the External Saphe-

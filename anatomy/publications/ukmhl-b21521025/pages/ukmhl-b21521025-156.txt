136 FASCIAE OF AN APONEUROTIC CHARACTER. to the whole extent of the linea aspera and to the condyles. The Fascia Lata consists of two sets of fibres, the circular and longitudinal, which in some places are separated, as where the tensor vaginae is inserted between them. In the upper and fore part of the thigh this fascia is of the utmost importance, in con- sequence of its connection with femoral hernia. About an inch and a half below poupart's liga- ment is the saphenic opening, for the passage of the superficial vessels as they join the deeper. That part of the fascia which lies to the inner side of the opening is much thinner than the outer portion, and is on a plane posterior; it covers the pectineus muscle, and is called the pubic or pectineal portion. This arises from the ischium, from the ramus and body of the pubis, and also from the linea innomi- nata of the latter bone, anterior to gimbernat's liga- ment. It passes outwards behind the femoral vessels to the psoas magnus, where it splits into two por- tions, one of which passes behind the psoas, and is connected to the capsular ligament of the hip joint; the other passes anterior to the psoas, and becomes continuous with the iliac or outer portion of the fascia lata. The outer or iliac portion of the fascia lata, in consequence of covering the tensor vaginae, rectus, and sartorius muscles, is on a plane anterior to the pubic portion and to the femoral vessels, over which it passes ; it is attached to the superior anterior spine

38 ARTICULATION OP VERTEBIME. 2. The Crucial Ligaments are short decussating fibres which pass from one vertebra to another, be- neath the anterior ligament. 3. The Common Posterior Ligament extends from the second cervical vertebra to the sacrum, on the posterior surface of the column. 4. The Inter-vertebral Substance connects the bodies of the two adjoining vertebrae, from the second to the sacrum. 5. The Ligamenta Subfiava form a series of elastic ligaments, connecting the arches of adjoining vertebra, from the second to the sacrum. 6. The Articular, or Oblique Processes, are con- nected together by imperfect capsular ligaments and synovial membranes. 7. The Inter-transverse Ligaments extend between the transverse processes. 8. The Inter-spinous Ligaments extend between the spinous processes. 9. The Ligamentum Nucha, or Cervical Liga- ment, extends from the spine of the occipital bone, to the spines of the five superior cervical vertebra. Ligaments proper to particular bones. Articulation of the Occiput with the Atlas and Axis. The occipital bone is united to the first vertebra by two synovial membranes and four ligaments. 1. and 2. The two Capsular. 3. The Anterior Portion of the Circular Ligament.

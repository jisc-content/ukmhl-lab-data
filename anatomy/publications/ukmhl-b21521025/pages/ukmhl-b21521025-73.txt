ARTICULATIONS OP LOWER EXTREMITY. 53 tibia, and is connected with the internal articular cartilage. 4. The long External Lateral Ligament passes from the external condyle to the head of the fibula. 5. The short External Lateral Ligament is pos- terior to the long, it also passes from the external condyle to the head of the fibula. The Internal Ligaments of the knee joint are, 6. The Anterior Crucial Ligament, which extends from the back part of the external condyle to the depression anterior to the spine of the tibia. 7. The Posterior Crucial Ligament passes from the internal condyle of the femur to the tibia poste- rior to the spine. 8. and 9. The Alar Ligaments are merely folds of the synovial membrane, where it is reflected from the tibia upon the edges of the ligamentum patellae. 10. The Mucous Ligament is also a fold of the synovial membrane, where it is reflected from the tibia to the depression between the condyles of the femur. 11. The Transverse Ligament connects the ante- rior cornua of the two semilunar cartilages; of these two bodies, the inner is the .longer from before to behind, and embraces the external, which is more circular than the inner, they are held in situ by their attachment to the tibia near its spine, and to the lateral ligaments.

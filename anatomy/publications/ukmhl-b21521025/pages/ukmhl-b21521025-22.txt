BONES OF THE HEAD AND FACE. 2 the Temporalis behind the external angular process. The Occipito Frontalis is sometimes said to be in- serted into the frontal bone, but it is rather inserted into the integuments with the Orbicularis and Cor- rugator than into the bone. The pulley round which the superior oblique muscle of the eye plays, is attached to the internal angular process. The Parietal Bone has only one muscle attach- ed; it arises. The Temporalis. The Temporal Bone has sixteen muscles attach- ed ; of these thirteen arise, three are inserted. Arise the Occipito Frontalis, Attrahens Aurem, Retrahens Aurem, Temporalis, Masseter, the origin of a muscle is in general less tendinous than the inser- tion, the reverse often is seen, consequently the two alleged dis- tinctions between the origin and insertion of a muscle not by any means of universal application; yet I consider the term attach- ment, to render it definite, requires so many different explicatives (as superior, inferior, internal, external, posterior, anterior, &c.) that it involves the use of longer explanations, or not more accurate expressions, than the old words origin and insertion. The muscles are enumerated, as far as possible, in the order of their attachment, and those which have only a partial origin or insertion into individual bones are put in italics.

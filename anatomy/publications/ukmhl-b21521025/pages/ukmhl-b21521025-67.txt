ARTICULATIONS OF UPPER EXTREMITY. 47 Ligamentum Carpi Annulare Dorsale, which ex- tends from the styloid process of the radius to that of the ulna. ARTICULATION OP THE CARPAL BONES WITH EACH OTHER. The three bones which form the first carpal row are connected together by three ligaments. 1. The Interosseal Ligaments are short strong fibres which pass from one bone to another. 2. The Anterior Ligament passes transversely across the bones, on their palmar surface. 3. The Posterior Ligament passes transversely across the bones, on their dorsal surface. The pisiform bone has a distinct capsular liga- ment and synovial sac, by which it is attached to the cuneiform bone. The four bones of the second carpal row are connected together by three ligaments in the same manner as those of the first row. Three distinct joints are said to be formed be- tween the first and second row of carpal bones, the trapezium and trapezoid with the scaphoid; the magnum with the scaphoid and lunar bones; and the unciform with the cuneiform bone; the first and last are arthrodial, and the second an enarthrodial, arti-

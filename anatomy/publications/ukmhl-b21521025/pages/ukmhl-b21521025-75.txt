ARTICULATIONS OF LOWER EXTREMITY. 55 of a triangular form, it extends from the internal mal- leolus to the inner side of the astragalus and calcis. 3. 4. and 5. There are three External Lateral Ligaments, all of which pass from the outer malleolus; the middle descends vertically to the upper part of the calcis; the anterior passes to the side and fore part of the astragalus; the posterior passes back- wards to the ridge on the back of the astragalus. ARTICULATION OF THE TARSAL BONES WITH EACH OTHER. The astragalus is connected to the calcis by two articulatory surfaces, each of which has a synovial sac ; there are three ligaments. 1. The Inter-osseous Ligament is attached to the fossae of these bones, between their articulating sur- faces. 2. The Posterior Ligament is attached to the ad- joining surfaces of the two bones. 3. The External Ligament passes from the outer surface of the astragalus to the calcis, under the middle external lateral ligament of the ankle joint. The astragalus is connected to the navicular bone by a synovial membrane, and a superior broad liga- ment, which covers the upper surfaces of the two bones.

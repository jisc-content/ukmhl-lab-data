12 ARTICULATIONS OF UPPER EXTREMITY. anterior, the other on the posterior surface of the joint. 3. The Inter.clavicular Ligament is a strong band of fibres, which passes from one clavicle to the other, immediately above the upper edge of the sternum, with which it is connected. 4. The Costo-clavicular, or Rhomboid Ligament, extends from the small tubercle, on the under surface of the sternal end of the clavicle, to the cartilage of the first rib. SCAPULOCLAVICULAR ARTICULATION. The external end of the clavicle forms with the acromion process of the scapula an arthrodial articu- lation, which is maintained by a synovial sac and two ligaments ; it is also connected to, but not in contact with, the coracoid process by two ligaments. 1. and 2. Superior and Inferior Ligaments pass between the clavicle and acromion process. 3. and 4. The Conoid and Trapezoid Ligaments: â€”the two have a single attachment to the coracoid process, but are separately inserted into the clavicle ; the conoid is the internal, the trapezoid the external and anterior. LIGAMENTS PROPER TO THE SCAPULA. These ligaments are two; the one which passes

DEEP FASOIiE. HI On the outer side of the spine of the pubis, from gimbernat's ligament to the femoral artery, it passes under poupart's ligament into the thigh, forming the anterior part of the sheath of the femoral vessels. From the remainder of poupart's ligament, and from the crista of the ilium, the fascia is reflected up- wards and inwards, towards the brim of the pelvis, behind the peritoneum and over the iliacus internus and psoas muscles, it is here called the Fascia Iliaca. This Fascia is on a plane posterior to the external iliac artery and vein; as these vessels pass under poupart's ligament into the thigh it sends a process behind them to form the posterior part of the sheath, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as the fascia transversalis does in front, by which the sheath is completed. This sheath is of a funnel shape, the base above, the apex below, it is straight on the outer side, and is in contact with the artery ; on the inner side, the vein being at some little distance from the base of gimbernat's ligament, which forms the inner boundary of the sheath, it is oblique, and gradually becomes narrower in the upper part of the thigh, where the reflected portion of the margin of the saphenic opening is lost upon it. Upwards the iliac fascia is continued upon the psoas muscle anterior to the quadratus lumborum, where it merges with the inner layer of the fascia lumborum, and is lost upon the crura of the dia- phragm. Internally the iliac fascia passes to the brim of the pelvis, and at the fore part, on the inner

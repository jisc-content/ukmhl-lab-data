ARTICULATIONS OF UPPER EXTREMITY. 43 between the coracoid and acromion processes, is broad where it is connected to the coracoid, and narrow where it is connected with the point of the acromion process. The other converts the posterior notch of the scapula into a foramen : they are— 1. The Anterior, Deltoid, or Coraco-acromial Ligament. 2. The Posterior, or Coracoid Ligament. HUMERO-SCAPULAR ARTICULATION. The shoulder joint forms a very perfect enarthro- dial articulation, in which the head of the humerus is received into the glenoid cavity of the scapula; this cavity is deepened by a rim of fibro-cartilage,—the glenoid ligament, which is partly derived from the biceps tendon. In this joint there is a synovial sac and two ligaments. 1. The Capsular Ligament encircles the joint, being attached to the necks of the scapula and hu- merus. 2. The Accessory, or Coraco-humeral, extends from the coracoid process to the greater tuberosity of the humerus, where it is confounded with the capsular ligament: it scarcely deserves to be consi- dered as distinct from the capsular.

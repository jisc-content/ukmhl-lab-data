The Semi Spinalis Colli arises from the five or six superior dorsal transverse processes ; it is inserted into the spines of the second, third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebrae. The Semi Spinalis Dorsi arises from the trans- verse processes of the dorsal vertebrae, (from the sixth to the eleventh) : it is inserted into the spinous pro- cesses of the four superior dorsal, and two inferior cervical vertebrae. The Rectus Capitis Posticus Major arises from the spinous process of the axis; it is inserted into the inferior transverse ridge of the occipital bone. The Rectus Capitis Posticus Minor arises from the posterior part of the atlas; it is inserted into the occipital bone, behind the foramen magnum. 'TheOBLiQuus Capitis Inferior arises from the spinous process of the axis; it is inserted into the transverse process of the atlas. The Obliquus Capitis Superior arises from the transverse process of the atlas; it is inserted into the occipital bone, between its transverse ridges, immedi- ately behind the mastoid process. The Multifidus Spin/e extends from the sacrum to the axis, passing obliquely between the transverse and spinous processes. The Inter-spinales and Inter-transversales

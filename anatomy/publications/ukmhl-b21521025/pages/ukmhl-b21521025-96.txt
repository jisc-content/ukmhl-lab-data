MUSCLES ON PARIETES OF THORAX. are respectively placed, as the names imply, between the spinous and transverse processes. The Levatores Cost arum arise from each of the dorsal transverse processes; they are inserted into each lower rib, between the tubercle and angle. MUSCLES UPON THE PARIETES OF THE THORAX, SIX PAIRS. 1. Pectoralis Major, 2. Pectoralis Minor, 3. Subclavius, 4. Serratus Magnus, 5. Intercostales, (i. Triangularis Sterni. The Pectoralis Major arises from the sternal half of the clavicle, from the whole of the anterior surface of the sternum, and from the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs; it is inserted into the anterior edge of the bicipital groove of the humerus. The Pectoralis Minor arises from the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, external to their cartilages; it is inserted into the coracoid process of the scapula. The Subclavius arises from the cartilage of the first rib ; it is inserted into the under surface of the acromial half of the clavicle. The Serratus Magnus arises from the eight or

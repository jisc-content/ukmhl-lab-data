NERVES. The nerves of the human body are usually consi- dered as belonging to two distinct systems: 1st.— Those which are for the purpose of volition, motion, and sensation whether general or particular, and which are all connected with the brain or spinal marrow;— constituting the Cerebro-spinal System; the nerves of relation, or those by which we are connected with ex- ternal things : and.—Those which are supposed more particularly to preside over secretion, assimilation, &c.; —■ constituting the Ganglionic or Sympathetic System; the nerves of organic or vegetative life. * The nerves of the cerebro-spinal system are * I speak of the attachment of nerves, in preference either to the old method of considering all nerves as arising from the brain and spinal marrow, or that which is now gaining ground, of describing the nerves of motion as arising from those of sensation as inserted into these parts; for as the nerves of motion, equally with those of sensation, are found throughout the body altogether independent of the central masses, as seen in acephalous monsters, it is, in point of fact, as incorrect to speak of the one, as arising from the brain or spinal marrow, as of the other; although I readily allow the function of the two orders of nerves is more studied in the latter than in the former. As it is my purpose at present to avoid physiological discus-

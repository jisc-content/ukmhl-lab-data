SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 157 4. The Anterior Cerebral Artery passes in- wards and forwards, above the optic, and beneath the olfactory nerve, to the commencement of the longitudinal fissure of the cerebrum; where it joins with its fellow of the opposite side by a short branch called the anterior communicating artery, by which the circle of Willis is completed. The anterior artery then winds round the corpus callosum, and divides into branches which are distributed upon the corn- mutual region of the hemispheres. SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. This artery supplies the whole of the upper extremity with blood. From its origin to the lower edge of the first rib, it retains the name of subcla- vian ; from thence, to the inferior edge of the tendons of the teres major and latissimus dorsi, it is called the axillary artery ; from this point to the bend of the elbow, where it divides into the radial and ulnar to supply the fore-arm and hand, it is named the brachial artery. The right subclavian artery is much shorter than the left, in consequence of its rising from innominata opposite to the sterno-clavicular articulation, while the left subclavian arises from the arch of the aorta, opposite to the second dorsal vertebra.

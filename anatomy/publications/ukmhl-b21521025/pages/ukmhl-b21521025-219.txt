MOTOR OCULI AND TROCHLEATOR NERVES. 199 rotic and choroid coats of the eye to expand into the retina. 3. MOTOR OCULI. The common motor of the eye is attached to the inner side of the cms cerebri, anterior to the pons Varolii; it passes through the cavernous sinus; as it enters the orbit through the superior lacerated opening, it divides into two branches, a superior or smaller, and an inferior or larger, which supply five of the seven muscles of the orbit. 1. The Superior Branch divides into two twigs, one for the levator of the upper eye-lid, and the other for the supe- rior straight muscle of the eye-ball. 2. The Lower or Larger Branch divides into three twigs ; an Internal, for the inner ^straight muscle ; a Middle, for the inferior straight ; and an Outer, for the inferior oblique muscle of the eye-ball: from this latter a minute twig passes to the lenticular gan- glion. 4. TROCHLEATOR NERVE. This nerve is attached to the processus a cere- bello ad testem, and to the valve of Vieussens; it runs between the layers of the tentorium to the caver- nous sinus, through which it passes, to enter the

FASCIjE op an aponeurotic character. 137 of the ilium, to the whole of poupart's ligament down to the spine of the pubis, and also to gimbernat's ligament; from it thus stretching over the femoral vessels, it necessarily forms a crescentic fold, the lower limb of this is joined with the pubic portion of the fascia to constitute the lower margin of the sa- phenic opening; the upper limb joins with gimber- nat's ligament, so that the concavity looks downwards and inwards, forming the falciform process of the fascia lata. The fascia, at the margin of the saphenic opening, does not terminate abruptly as at first sight appears, but is reflected downwards upon the sheath of the artery and vein, thus completely preventing any thing passing from above through the saphenic opening down upon the sheath; this is readily seen by dividing the fascia transversely two inches below the opening, and carefully raising it, when the re- flected layer will be very evident. At the lower part of the limb the fascia lata is strengthened by its connection with the origin of the short head of the biceps; it is stretched across the popliteal space, and is attached to the condyles of the femur, and to the heads of the tibia and fibula ; from the muscles inserted into these points it receives an addition of fibres. It closely envelopes the muscles on the anterior and outer part of the leg, sends inter- muscular septa between them, and is connected to the spines of the tibia and fibula as far as the ante- rior annular ligament. On the posterior surface of the leg there are two layers of this fascia; the super- N 3

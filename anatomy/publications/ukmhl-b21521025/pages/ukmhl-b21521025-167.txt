ARCH OF AORTA. 1*7 ARCH OF THE AORTA. This is divided into three portions, the ascending, transverse, and descending. The ascending extends from the origin of the aorta to the cartilage of the second right rib, it is the most dilated portion of the aorta; it is directly behind the sternum and between the pulmonary artery and descending cava; from it arise two branches only, the right and left coronary, which supply the heart. These are given off from two of the small pouches, or sinuses of morgagni, imme- diately above the semilunar valves. The Right or Anterior Coronary Artery appears between the pulmonary artery and right auricular appendix; it runs in the depression be- tween the auricle and ventricle, and divides into three branches: the Superior, Inferior, and Posterior. The Left or Posterior Coronary Artery is the smaller, it appears between the pulmonary artery and left auricular appendix, and divides into two branches, the Superior and Inferior. The transverse portion of the arch extends from the cartilage of the second right rib to the second dorsal vertebra; it lies upon the lowest part of the trachsea, and is somewhat overlapped by the left

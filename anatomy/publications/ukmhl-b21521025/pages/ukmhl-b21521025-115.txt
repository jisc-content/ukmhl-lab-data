MUSCLES OP HIP AND BACK OF THIGH. 95 smaller glutseus into the upper and outer part of the great trochanter. The Gluteus Minimus arises from the dorsum of the ilium, between the superior semicircular ridge and the brim of the acetabulum ; it is inserted with the last muscle into the great trochanter. The Pyriformis arises within the pelvis, from the second, third, and fourth pieces of the sacrum, and slightly from the posterior part of the ilium; it is inserted into the upper part of the trochanteric fossa. The Gemelli ; the superior arises from the spine of the ischium, the inferior from the upper part of its tuberosity ; they are inserted with the obturator inter- nus into the trochanteric fossa. The Obturator Internus arises within the pel- vis, from the obturator ligament and surrounding margin of the obturator foramen, also from the obtu- rator fascia; the tendon passes out of the pelvis at the lesser sciatic notch, between the two gemelli, to be inserted with them into the trochanteric fossa. The Obturator Externus arises from the outer surface of the obturator ligament, and from the sur- rounding margin of bone; it is inserted into the lower part of the trochanteric fossa. The Quadratus Femoris arises from the exter- nal surface of the tuber ischii; it is inserted into the lower part of the great trochanter, and into the inter-trochanteric line. The Biceps has a double origin: the long head arises from the upper part of the tuber ischii in com-

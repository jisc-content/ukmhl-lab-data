LUMBAR PLEXUS AND ITS BRANCHES. 222 on the upper and inner part of the arm ; these are called the nerves of Wrisburg. LUMBAR NERVES. These correspond in number with the lumbar vertebrae ; the first receives a branch from the lowest dorsal, the last sends a branch to join the sacral plexus. The posterior branches are small, and escape between the transverse processes to the muscles of the back; the five anterior cords receive twigs from the sympathetic, and unite with each other in the substance of the psoas muscle, to form the lumbar plexus, from which the four following nerves pass off:â€” 1. Inguino-cutaneous, 2. Anterior Crural, 3. Obturator, 4. Lumbo-sacral. 1. INGUINO-CUTANEOUS. The inguino-cutaneous consist of three branches, which arise from the two first lumbar nerves. The External passes obliquely over the quadratus lum- borum muscle to the middle of the crista of the ilium, where it sends branches to the abdominal muscles, to the outer and upper part of the thigh,

SUPERFICIAL FASCIiE. anatomical and surgical importance and relations of the various fasciae, as well also of the numerous and most important parts with which they are connected, it is essential not to regard each portion which pos- sesses a name as a distinct part, but to trace, as far as may be, its continuity with neighbouring fasciae; by so doing the difficulty is much simplified, and more readily overcome. 1.—SUPERFICIAL FASCIiE. Under the integuments throughout the body a subcutaneous cellular tissue is found; the inner surface of this, by which it is connected to the sub- jacent parts, assumes more the appearance of a thin membrane than the cutaneous does. This structure, which is universal, in particular parts is consider- ably more distinct and evident than in others; to these portions the name of superficial fascia; is given , to distinguish them from similar structures more deeply seated. This being premised, and it being always recollected that these individual portions never arise or terminate abruptly, but gradually merge in the continuous cellular tissue, they may separately be described. Superficial Cervical Fascia.—This Fascia in some persons is weak and scarcely discernible, while

INOSCULATION OF ARTERIES. Before passing from the arteries it may be advan- tageous to reflect for a few moments upon what branches the maintenance of the circulation must principally depend, in case the main trunk becomes obliterated. Now, although those arteries, which are of sufficient size and regularity of origin and distri- bution to have received names, must be of infinite importance, and ought always to be most carefully considered by the anatomist and surgeon, as those which must be chiefly relied upon for carrying for- ward the blood; yet it should never be forgotten, that in every part of the body, and in almost every tissue, there is a constant and intimate connection, by means of the free inosculation of blood vessels, which, though individually small in the natural state of parts, must, even then, when taken collectively, be of the greatest use in the proper conveyance of blood; but when the main channel becomes ob- structed, these small vessels become so much enlarged as to play, scarcely a secondary part, in carrying the blood to the parts beyond the obstruction. It must also be borne in mind that, when a ligature is placed

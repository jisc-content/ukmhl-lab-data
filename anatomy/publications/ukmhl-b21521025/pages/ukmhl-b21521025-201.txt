INOSCULATION OP ARTERIES. 181 and above all, the vertebral will asist in keeping up the supply through the vessels of the brain. If the Subclavian artery is closed on the outer side of the scalenus muscle, the communication will be principally through the subdivisions of the supra- scapular and transverse cervical arteries, two branches of the thyroid axis, which form a complete chain of inosculations round the shoulder, with the subsca- pular, the thoracic, and the circumflex arteries; or should the obstruction involve the origins of these latter vessels, by affecting the axillary also, then the former would pour their blood into the branches of them, and these again into the profunda and mus- cular ramifications of the brachial artery. If the Brachial Artery be tied, then the inos- culation between the thoracic, circumflex, and sub- scapular branches, and those of the two profunda, and the numerous muscular twigs of the brachial artery, and these again with the four recurrent arte- ries at the elbow, is so free as to convey the blood almost as readily as through the usual channel. And so frequent is the union between branches of the ulnar and radial arteries in the fore-arm and hand, that, in order to prevent the flow of blood through any particular portion of either of these vessels, it is necessary to tie it at both ends. It is scarcely probable that any complete ob- struction can take place in either the Thoracic or in the Abdominal Aorta above the origin of the infe- R

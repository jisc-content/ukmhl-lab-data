ARTICULATIONS OF RIBS. 40 fibro-cartilage by two complete synovial sacs and two ligaments, except the first, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, which only articulate with one vertebra each, and where consequently there is only one synovial sac and no inter-articular ligament. 1. The Anterior Ligament surrounds the anterior surface of the head of the rib, and divides into three fasciculi, to be attached to the two vertebrae and to the connecting inter-vertebral substance. 2. The Inter-articular Ligament attaches the emi- nence between the two articular surfaces on the head of the rib to the inter-vertebral substance. The tubercle of each rib, except the eleventh and twelfth, is articulated with the transverse process of the inferior of the two vertebrae, to the bodies of which its head is united. In this articulation there is one synovial membrane and three ligaments. 1. and 2. The Posterior and Internal Costotrans- verse Ligaments, which extend from the transverse process, to the neck of the rib. 3. The External Oblique Ligament, which extends from the neck of the rib below, to the transverse and oblique processes immediately above. The anterior extremity of each rib is united with its corresponding cartilage by fibres which pass on both surfaces; each of the seven superior ribs is also connected with the sternum by a small synovial membrane, and Anterior and Posterior Ligaments.

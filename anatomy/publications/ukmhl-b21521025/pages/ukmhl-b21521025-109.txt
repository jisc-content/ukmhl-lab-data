PERINEAL MUSCLES. Hit I 3 these are called the decussating fibres, (the right fasci- culus is the larger), and separate the aortic from the lesophageal opening; the crura are inserted into the posterior border of the cordiform tendon. The Quadratus Lumbobum arises from the pos- terior fourth of the crista ilii, and from the ilio-lumbar ligament; it is inserted into the transverse processes of the four upper lumbar vertebrae, and into the last rib for about half its length. The Psoas Parvus arises from the side of the bodies of the last dorsal and the first lumbar ver- tebrse; it is inserted into the linea ilio-pectinea, behind the femoral vessels. The Psoas Magnus arises from the body of the last dorsal, and from the bodies and transverse pro- cesses of all the lumbar vertebrae, and their inter- vertebral substances ; it is inserted into the lesser trochanter, and into the ridge below it. The Iliacus Intebnus arises from the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra, from the greater part of the crista of the ilium, from the two anterior spinous processes, and from the iliac fossa ; it is inserted, with the psoas magnus, into the lesser tro- chanter, and into the oblique ridge below it.

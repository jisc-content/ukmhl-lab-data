138 FASCI2E OP AN APONEUROTIC CHARACTER. ficial is weak, and is external to the gastrocnemius muscle; the deeper is placed between the deep and superficial muscles, and is stronger than the superfi- cial portion, receiving an aponeurotic expansion from the semi-membranosus muscle; at the lower part of the leg, on each side of the tendo achilles, these two layers join, and are inserted into the malleolar pro- cesses, into the sheath of the peronsei muscles, and into the internal annular ligament. The Anterior Annular Ligament, which is attached to the outer malleolus and calcis, passes over, and forms sheaths for, the extensor tendons, and is there connected with the inner malleolus. The Inner An- nular Ligament is attached to the inner malleolus, and sheath of the flexor tendons, and passes to be connected with the tuberosity of the calcis. From the anterior annular ligament a thin aponeurotic ex- pansion passes over the dorsum of the foot; this, in the middle, is attached to the phalanges; on the inner side, to the margin of the plantar fascia ; and on the outer, to the fifth metatarsal bone, and to the outer margin of the plantar fascia. The Plantar Fascia is an exceedingly strong, dense layer of longitudinal fibres, interwoven with transverse, it extends from the tubercles of the os calcis to the phalanges of the toes ; at its origin it is narrow, but as it passes forwards it expands and divides into three portions, which are not only upon different planes, but separated from each other by two inter-muscular septa.

216 BRACHIAL PLEXUS. the chest between the subclavian artery and vein; it then passes upon the sides of the pericardium to the diaphragm, where it is distributed. Two or three filaments from the cervical plexus also pass towards the carotid sheath, to join the descendens noni. BRACHIAL PLEXUS. This Plexus is formed by the large anterior branches of the four inferior cervical and the first dorsal nerve; the posterior branches being very small. The nerves emerge between the scalenus medius and anticus muscles; they are placed above, and to the outer side of the subclavian artery, in the small, deep triangular space formed by the omo- hyoideus, the scalenus anticus, and the first rib. At first the fifth and sixth cervical unite, as do the eighth cervical and the first dorsal, leaving the seventh cervical separate; they pass, with different degrees of obliquity, over the first rib, where they all join in a single large flattened cord, and again separate in the axillary space to form the plexus of the same name. The Axillary Plexus in the middle of the cavity completely surrounds the artery ; the branches derived from it are nine in number, or rather, they

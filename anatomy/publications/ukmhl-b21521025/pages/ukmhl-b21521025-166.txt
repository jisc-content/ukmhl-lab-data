146 SYSTEMATIC CIRCULATION. SYSTEMATIC CIRCULATION. The aorta arises from the highest part of the right side of the left ventricle, immediately behind the pulmonary artery, consequently opposite to the .junction of the cartilage of the left fourth rib with the sternum, and also to the left of the body of the fourth dorsal vertebra; at first the aorta is placed between the pulmonary artery and the vena cava descendens, the former being before and to the left, the latter behind and to the right; like the roots of all the other vessels it is at first covered by the peri- cardium. It passes forwards, upwards, and to the right, as high as the cartilage of the second rib upon the right side; it then curves to the left and passes transversely across the upper part of the thorax, lying upon the lower part of the trachaaa, to the left side of the body of the second dorsal vertebra; it then proceeds downwards through the thorax, enters the abdomen between the crura of the dia- phragm, and at the lower edge of the fourth lumbas vertebra, it divides into the two common iliacs. From its origin to the third dorsal vertebra, it is called the Arch of the Aorta; from thence to the twelfth dorsal vertebra, the Thoracic Aorta; and through the remainder of its course, the Abdominal.

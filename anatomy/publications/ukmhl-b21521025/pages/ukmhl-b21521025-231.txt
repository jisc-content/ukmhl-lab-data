LINGUAL NERVE. The Lingual Nerve is attached by several fila- ments (six or eight) to the groove between the olivary and pyramidal bodies; it passes out of the cranium, through the anterior condyloid foramen, when it com- municates with the nervous loop of the atlas, with the ninth, tenth, and eleventh pairs of nerves, and also with the sympathetic. It is here behind the internal carotid artery and jugular vein, but descends along their external side; it turns forwards and becomes superficial to both carotids, hooks round the occipital artery, and passes parallel, but superficial, to the lingual artery; it then runs between the hyo- glossus and mylo-hyoideus, as far as the tip of the tongue, to the muscles of which organ it is prin- cipally distributed.

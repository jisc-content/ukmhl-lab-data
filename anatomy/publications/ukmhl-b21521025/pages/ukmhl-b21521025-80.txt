60 MUSCLES OF PACE. The Orbicularis Palpebrarum arises from the internal angular process of the frontal bone, and from the superior edge of the tarsal tendon; it is inserted into the inferior edge of this tendon, and into the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. The Corrugator Supercilii arises from the internal angular process of the frontal bone; it is inserted into the integuments of the eye-brow. The Pyramidalis Nasi arises (when present) from the occipito-frontalis; it is inserted into the fibres of the compressor nasi. This small muscle is formed by a few of the fibres of the occipito-frontalis being continued down the nasal bone. The Compressor Nasi arises from the canine fossa of the superior maxillary bone; it is inserted into the dorsum of the nose by a thin aponeurosis common to the two muscles. The Levator Labii Superioris Al^eque Nasi arises by a double origin: 1st, from the edge of the orbit above the infra-orbital foramen; 2nd, from the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone ; it is inserted into the cartilage of the nose and into the upper lip. The Zygomaticus Minor (often wanting) arises from the upper part of the malar bone; it is inserted into the upper lip near the commissure. The Zygomaticus Major arises from the zygo- matic process of the malar bone; it is inserted into the commissure of the lips. The Levator Anguli Oris arises from the

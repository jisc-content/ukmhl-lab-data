88 MUSCLES WITHIN THE ABDOMEN. The Rhctus arises from the upper part of the body of the pubis ; it is inserted into the ensiform car- tilage, with its external ligament, and into the fifth and sixth ribs. The Pyramidalis arises from the pubis; it is inserted into the linea alba, mid-way between the umbilicus and pubis. MUSCLES WITHIN THE ABDOMEN, FOUR PAIRS AND ONE SINGLE. 1". Diaphragma, (single) 2. Quadratus Lumborum, 3. Psoas Parvus, 4. Psoas Magnus, 5. Iliacus Internus. The Diaphragm consists of the superior or greater muscle, and the two crura. The superior muscle arises from the posterior surface of the ensi- form cartilage, from the cartilages of the seven inferior ribs, and from the ligament which extends from the first lumbar vertebra to the last rib; the fibres con- verge to be inserted into the central cordiform tendon. The right crus or appendix is the larger, it arises from the bodies and inter-vertebral substances of the four upper lumbar vertebra ; the left crus arises from the three upper lumbar vertebrae. These crura ascend on either side the aorta, across which, each crus sends a fasciculus of fibres to the opposite side;

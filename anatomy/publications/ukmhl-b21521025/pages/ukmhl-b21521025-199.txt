179 INOSCULATION OF ARTERIES. upon a large artery, the obliteration does not gene- rally extend farther than the part from whence the next large branch arises. If the Arteria Innominata should become oblite- rated, the right side of the head and neck, and the right upper extremity must, for their supply of blood, depend entirely upon the vessels of the other side. Thus, the superficial parts of the face, head, and neck, will be supplied through the junction of the branches of the two external carotids; while the brain, &c, will be as freely supplied as before, in consequence of the very free communication between the vessels of opposite sides through the circle of Willis ; by these channels the right internal, external, and common carotids will be filled. The right sub- clavian will also become filled; principally from the vertebral, the inferior thyroid, the deep cervical, the internal mammary, and the superior intercostal branches, conveying the blood into it which they receive from the various arteries with which they inosculate. Should the Carotid and Subclavian on the left side by any chance become obliterated, the commu- nication would be through the same vessels as if the innominata were obstructed, only the blood would flow from right to left, instead of from left to right; except that which passes through the intercostal and mammary arteries, which inosculate principally

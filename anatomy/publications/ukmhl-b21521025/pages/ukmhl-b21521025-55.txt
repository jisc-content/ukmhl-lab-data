35 DI ARTHROSIS. This genus of articulation includes three spe- cies :â€” 1. Sutura, by which the bones of the cranium and face are united; it contains three varieties. 1. The Serrated Suture, where the serrated edge of one bone is received into that of another ; as in the sagittal, coronal, and lambdoidal suture. 2. The Squamous, where the edge of one bone overlaps that of another; as the squa- mous portions of the temporal and the parietal bones. 3. Harmonia, where the serrations are very- slight, the edges of the bones being nearly flat; as in the tranverse suture of the face. 2. Schindylesis, or Furrowing, where the edge of one bone is received into a groove in another; as the median spine of the sphenoid into the vomer. 3. Gomphosis, where a portion of one bone is inserted into a cavity in another; as the teeth into the alveolar processes. 2. DIARTHROSIS. It is in this kind of articulation that the most per- fect form of joint is seen, where not only ligament and

The Ulna, with its inter-osseal branch, supplying the flexors of the fingers, and by the palmar arch the whole of the three inner fingers and ulnar side of the index, has its counterpart in the Posterior Tibial, which, with its peroneal branch supplies the flexors of the toes, and by its outer plantar branch, forming the Plantar Arch, the whole of the three outer toes, and fibular side of the second toe. NERVES. The analogy between the nerves of the upper and lower extremities is perhaps not altogether so striking as that of the arteries, but it is still very evident. Thus the External Cutaneous nerve (if the hand be prone, the internal) of the fore-arm, accom- panies the cephalic vein to the radial side of the hand, the Inner or Greater Saphenus nerve accompanies the internal saphena vein (the cephalic of the leg) to the tibial side of the foot. The Internal Cutaneous nerve (external, in a state of pronation) of the fore- arm accompanies the basilic vein to the ulnar side of the hand; the External Saphenus nerve, accom- panies the smaller saphena vein (the basilic of the leg) to the fibular side of the foot. The Radio-spiral nerve at the bend of the elbow

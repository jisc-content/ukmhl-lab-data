e SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM. The Sympathetic or Ganglionic System, consists of a series of ganglia arranged on each side the vertebral column, and connected together by nervous cords. From both the ganglia and the connecting cords nu- merous branches pass off; these are principally distri- buted to the organs of assimilation and secretion, or pass with the blood vessels ; each of the spinal nerves and many of the cerebral nerves, (perhaps all, except those of special sensation) are joined by filaments of the sympathetic. From the frequent union, separa- tion, and re-union of the branches of this system many plexuses are formed ; these are variously named, either from their situation, or the nerves which com- pose them. The two sympathetic nerves are united together, so as to constitute an unbroken chain; superiorly, upon the anterior communicating cerebral artery, by the Ganglion of Ribes; inferiorly, upon the coccyx, by the Ganglion Impar. For the purposes of description, the sympathetic is divided into the Cervical, Thoracic, and Abdominal portions; but besides the ganglia in these regions, several small ganglia are found in the head and face, which are x

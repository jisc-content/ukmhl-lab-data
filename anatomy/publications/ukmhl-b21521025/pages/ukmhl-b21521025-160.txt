140 DEEP FASCI.fi. versalis and Iliaca are found investing the exterior surface of the peritoneum, the one under the trans- versalis muscle, the other above the psoas and iliacus muscles. When the transversalis muscle is removed, the peritoneum, at the upper part of the abdomen, is found to be covered by a thin cellular tissue, which as we proceed downwards, gradually becomes stronger and denser, though still very thin; if traced, it is seen to be attached to the crista of the ilium, to the whole of poupart's ligament, and behind the rectus to be continuous with that of the opposite side. About midway between the superior anterior spine of the ilium and the symphysis of the pubis, and rather less than an inch above poupart's ligament, the vas deferens and spermatic vessels meet on their passage through the inguinal canal; at this point they pass through a fissure in the fibres of the fascia transversalis, carrying a prolongation of it with them, (the fascia spermatica interna of anatomists, fascia propria of inguinal hernia of sur- geons), by which this opening is rendered indistinct, and unlike a ring, as its common name implies, (internal abdominal ring). If the Fascia Transversalis be divided across the lower part of the abdomen, carefully dissected down, and the peritoneum then pushed upwards, it will be seen that this fascia does not terminate abruptly at its attachments. In the median line, behind the recti muscles, it continues downwards, posterior to the symphysis pubis, where we shall afterwards trace it.

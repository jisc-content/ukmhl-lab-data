OPHTHALMIC NERVE. 200 orbit by the lacerated opening; it is distributed ex- clusively to the superior oblique muscle. 5. TRIGEMINAL. The fifth is a very large nerve ; it is apparently attached to the pons Varolii, but may be traced through this, dividing into a larger or posterior fasciculus of fibres, to be connected with the restiform body, or posterior column of the spinal marrow; and a smaller anterior fasciculus, to be connected with the pyramidal body, or anterior column of the spinal marrow. The two fasciculi, closely connected together, run immediately under the tentorium, and over the ridge of the petrosal bone, to its anterior surface, upon which, the posterior fasciculus forms the Semilunar or Gasserian Ganglion. The anterior bundle passes between it and the bone, to form part of the inferior maxillary nerve. From the ganglion proceed the three large divisions of the fifth nerve : each of these gives off numerous branches. 1st Division, or Ophthalmic Nerve, 2nd Division, or Superior Maxillary Nerve, 3rd Division, or Inferior Maxillary Nerve. 1st Division. The Ophthalmic Nerve passes through the ca-

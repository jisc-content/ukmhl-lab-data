In this course it lies upon the tibi- alis posticus and flexor longus communis muscles, and is covered by the deep layer of fascia, the super- ficial muscles and fascia, and the integuments. As it passes behind the inner ankle, the tendons of the tibialis posticus and extensor communis run close to the malleolar process, then the artery, veins, and nerve, and lastly the tendon of the flexor pollicis. Many muscular twigs arise; the only branch of im- portance given off by this vessel is, the Arteria Peronsea, which at the lower part of the leg subdivides into two branches, Arteries Peronece, Anterior et Posterior. PLANTAR ARTERIES. Between the two origins of the abductor pollicis

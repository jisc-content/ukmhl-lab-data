44 ARTICULATIONS OF UPPER EXTREMITY. HUMERO-CUBITAL ARTICULATION. The elbow joint is a perfect example of the hinge articulation, it is formed by the expanded convex condyles of the humerus being received into the heads of the ulna and radius ; the connection is maintained by a synovial sac and four ligaments. 1. The Anterior Ligament extends from the lower part of the humerus, to the coronary ligament of the radius and coronoid process of the ulna. 2. The Posterior Ligament is not so distinct as the anterior, it extends from one condyle to the other, behind the olecranon process. 3. The External Lateral Ligament extends from the external condyle to the coronary ligament of the radius. 4. The Internal Lateral Ligament extends from the internal condyle, to the olecranon and coronoid processes of the ulna. RADIO-ULNAR ARTICULATIONS. The radius and ulna are connected throughout their extent by ligament. Two joints of the trochoi- dal kind are formed; these are distinguished as the superior and inferior radio-ulnar articulations. The superior properly forms a part of the elbow joint, since the head of the radius enters into the

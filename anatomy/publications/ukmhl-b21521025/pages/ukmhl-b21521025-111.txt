PERINEAL MUSCLES. 91 the opposite muscle, while the anterior fibres are inserted into the side of the corpus cavernosum. The Transvebsalis Perin^-ei arises from the tuber ischii; it is inserted into the central point of the perinaeum; in some there is a second small muscle pursuing a similar course,â€”the transversalis perineal alter. The Levator Ani arises from the posterior sur- face of the pubis, near the symphysis, from the ilium above the obturator foramen, from the ischium and its spinous process, and also from the obturator fascia; it is inserted into the common central point of the perinseum, beneath the membranous part of the urethra and prostrate gland, into the sides of the rec- tum, into the ligamentous expansion between the rectum and coccyx, and also into the side of the coccyx itself. The anterior fibres which surround the urethra are described by some as a distinct muscle, under the name of Compressor Urethra. The Coccvgeus arises from the spine of the ischium ; it is inserted into the side of the coccyx and into the lower part of the sacrum. In the female, instead of the erector penis, there is a smaller muscle, the erector clitoridis; and in place of the accelerator urinae, there is the constrictor vaginas, which embraces the vagina, extending from the central perineal point to the clitoris. The other muscles are similar to those in the male.

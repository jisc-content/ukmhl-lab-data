56 ARTICULATIONS OF LOWER EXTREMITY. The calcis and navicular bones, though not in contact, are connected by two ligaments; 1. The External Ligament, which passes between the outer surfaces of these bones. 2. The Calcaneonavicular, or Sub-astragalar Ligament, extends from the smaller tuberosity of the calcis to the inferior surface of the navicular bone, and supports the astragalus. The calcis and cuboid bones form an arthrodial articulation, which is strengthened by a synovial sac and two ligaments. 1. The Superior Ligament passes from the upper surface of one bone to that of the other. 2. The Inferior Ligament is very strong, and consists of a deep and superficial layer; it extends from near the tuberosity of the calcis to the inferior surface of the cuboid bone, and also to the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. The navicular and cuboid bones are connected by dorsal and plantar transverse fibres. A dorsal and a plantar band of fibres connect the cuboid and external cuneiform bones together. The three cuneiform bones are connected to the navicular by a common synovial membrane, and by dorsal and plantar ligamentous fibres:â€”they are also

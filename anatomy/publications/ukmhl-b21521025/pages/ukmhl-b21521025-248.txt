228 SACRAL PLEXUS AND ITS BRANCHES. nus, which is joined by a branch from the musculo- cutaneous; it runs down upon the outer side of the leg, with the smaller saphena vein, and passes be- hind the outer ankle to the external side of the foot. The posterior tibial nerve then proceeds downwards, between the deep and superficial layer of muscles, covered by the deep fascia, and on the external side of the artery, to the space between the heel and the inner ankle, where it divides into the internal and external plantar nerves. The Internal Plantar nerve is the larger, (the outer artery is the larger) ; it passes above the ab- ductor pollicis, and divides into four digital branches, which supply the whole of the three internal toes and the inner side of the fourth. The External Plantar nerve passes above the flexor brevis communis to the little toe, which, as well as the outer side of the fourth toe and the deep plantar muscles, it supplies.

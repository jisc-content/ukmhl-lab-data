AXILLARY PLEXUS AND ITS BRANCHES. 8. RADIAL NERVE. This is the radio or musculo-spiral nerve; it takes a spiral direction round the humerus, passing with the superior profunda artery between the three portions of the triceps muscle; it appears on the outer side of the arm, between the brachialis ami- cus and the supinator longus muscles, and descends to the elbow, where it divides into the proper radial, and into the inter.osseal nerves. 1. The Radial nerve runs along the fore-arm, on the outer side of the radial artery, and winds round the lower end of the radius, under the supi- nator bngus tendons, to the back of the wrist, where it divides into branches to supply the radial side of the dorsum of the hand and fingers. 2. The Posterior Inter-osseal nerve winds round the head of the radius, upon the supinator brevis muscle, and runs down the fore-arm, with the pos- terior inter-osseal artery ; it divides into branches to supply the extensors and supinators of the fore- arm. 9. CIRCUMFLEX NERVE. This nerve passes round the humerus in company with the posterior circumflex artery, under the deltoid muscle; it escapes from the axillary space by a large quadrangular opening, formed, externally, by the

AXILLARY PLEXUS AND ITS BRANCHES. 219 fingers; in this course the nerve gives off the following branches:— 1. Muscular Branches in the arm, 2. Anterior Inter-osseal Nerve, 3. Muscular Branches to the pronators and flex- ors, but not to the supinator or extensor muscles of the fore-arm; 4. Superficial Branch at the wrist, 5. Five Digital Branches. 7. ULNAR NERVE. In the arm this nerve descends upon the short head of the triceps, and passes behind the inner con- dyle, to continue along the fore-arm, on the inner side of the ulnar artery, between the flexor digi- torum sublimis and the flexor ulnaris; it passes over the annular ligament into the palm of the hand. In this course the ulnar gives off the fol- lowing branches :— 1. A few Muscular Branches in the arm, 2. Several Branches to the muscles of the fore- arm, 3. Posterior Ulnar Branches of the wrist, to supply the inner side of the dorsum of the hand, 4. Deep Palmar Branch, to the interossei muscles, 5. Superficial Branch, which subdivides into three, to supply the whole of the Jittle finger and the ulnar side of third finger.

The Transverse Sinus connects the two inferior petrosal sinuses, across the basilar process of the occipital bone. The torcular Herophili is placed opposite to the tuberosity of the occipital bone, and is a sort of pouch, where the superior longitudinal, the straight, and the two cerebellic sinuses pour their blood, which the two lateral convey away, so that six sinuses open into it. The Lateral Sinus on each side passes out of the cranium, through the posterior lacerated opening, and takes the name of Internal Jugular Vein ; this accompanies the carotid artery, and in its course down the neck receives part of the facial vein, the laryngeal, the thyroideal, and many muscular branches. Opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation the inter- nal jugular and subclavian veins join, to form the vena innominata. The principal of the superficial cervical veins is the External Jugular, which com- mences in the parotid gland by the union of the temporal and the internal maxillary veins; near the angle of the jaw a branch of the facial vein joins it. The external jugular passes down the neck over the sterno-mastoid muscle, parallel with the fibres of the platysma myoides, and opens, behind the cla- vicle, into the subclavian vein.

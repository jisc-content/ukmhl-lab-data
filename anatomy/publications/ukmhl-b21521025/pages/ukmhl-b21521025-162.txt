DEEP FASCIAE. 142 side of gimbernat's ligament, it becomes continuous with that portion of the fascia transversalis which passes behind the symphysis pubis; it now loses the name of fascia iliaca and is called the pelvic fascia. The Pelvic Fascia proceeds from the brim of the pelvis to the upper edge of the levator ani muscle, where it divides into two layers, one of which passes internal to this muscle, the other external. The in- ternal layer proceeds on the surface of the levator ani, between it and the peritoneum, to a line drawn from the lower edge of the symphysis pubis to the spine of the ischium, forming the Vesical Fascia; it is then reflected upon the bladder, on the muscular coat of which it is lost; anteriorly, as it passes over the upper part of the prostrate gland, it forms the anterior true ligament of the bladder, (the false being the reflec- tion of the peritoneum) ; laterally, as it is reflected upon the side of the bladder, it forms the true lateral ligament; posteriorly, it is lost upon the sides of the rectum. The external layer of the pelvic fascia passes between the outer surface of the levator ani and the obturator internus muscles, to which it closely adheres; this constitutes the Obturator Fascia. Infe- riorly, the obturator fascia is attached to the tuber ischii, to the rami of the ischium and pubis, and also to the falciform process of the greater sciatic ligament, from which it receives an increase of strength; it is then continued across the perinseum, to join with the opposite fascia, constituting the deep

The Teres Minor arises from the dorsal surface of the scapula, immediately above the inferior costa; it is inserted into the lower part of the greater tube- rosity of the humerus. The Teres Major arises from the dorsal surface of the inferior angle of the scapula; it is inserted with the latissimus dorsi, into the posterior ridge of the bicipital groove of the humerus. The Subscapulars arises from the whole of the subscapular fossa, and adheres very closely to the capsular ligament of the shoulder joint ; it is inserted into the smaller tubercle of the humerus.

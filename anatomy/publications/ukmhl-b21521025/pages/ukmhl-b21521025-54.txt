LIGAMENTS. The extent and direction of motion possessed by different joints is very various, depending upon three causes:â€”1st. Upon the form of the articulatory sur- faces of the bones entering into the joint. 2nd. Upon the form and position of the ligaments by which these are held together. 3rd. Upon the number, force, and direction of the muscles which move them. All joints may be classed under three genera. 1. Synarthrodia!,, or immoveable. 2. Diarthrodial, or moveable. 3. Amphiarthrodial, or those intermediate be- tween the other two genera. 1. SYNARTHROSIS. This form of articulation is only found between flat bones, where the two neighbouring bones are articulated by an intervening cartilaginous plate, (sometimes very small) which is strengthened by the continuation of the periosteum over it.

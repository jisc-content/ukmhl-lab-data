52 ARTICULATIONS OF LOWER EXTREMITY. 3. The Inter-articular, or Round Ligament, ex- tends from the bottom of the cotyloid cavity to the fossa at the head of the femur. FEMORO-TIBIAL ARTICULATION. The knee joint is formed by the condyles of the femur, the upper extremity of the tibia, and the patella. It is a most complicated joint, and has more ligaments than any other in the body. In consequence of some of them being partially enveloped by the synovial membrane, they are divided into the external and internal; all are however, in reality external to the synovial sac. The ligaments are sometimes enu- merated as fourteen, including the synovial sac, and the two semilunar cartilages. The External are 1. The Ligamentum Patella, wbich attaches the patella to the tubercle of the tibia; it is a continuation of the tendons of the four extensor muscles. 2. The Posterior Ligament is intimately con- nected with the tendon of the semi-membranous muscle; it passes from the external condyle of the femur to the inner and back part of the tibia. 3. The Internal Lateral Ligament, like the exter- nal, is posterior to the centre of motion: it passes from the inner condyle of the femur to the head of the

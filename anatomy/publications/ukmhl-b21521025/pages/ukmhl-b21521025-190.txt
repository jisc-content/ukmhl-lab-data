They are short large trunks, and seldom give off any branches; that on the right side is rather the longer, and passes over the termination of the left iliac vein and the com- mencement of the vena cava ascendens. They are behind the peritoneum, and consequently poste- rior to all the viscera; they divide into two large branches. 1. Arteria Iliaca Interna vel Hypogastrica, 2. Arteria Iliaca Externa. INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. This short branch extends from the sacro-iliac synchondrosis to the sacral notch j the accompanying vein is posterior to the artery, and the pyriformis muscle and sacral plexus of nerves internal to it. The ureter passes anterior to it at its commencement, and the vas deferens at its ligamentous termination upon the bladder. The branches of the internal iliac are exceedingly irregular in number and origin; in the male they are usually enumerated as nine, in the female as eleven ; they may be divided into two sets, one which supplies the parts within the pelvis, the

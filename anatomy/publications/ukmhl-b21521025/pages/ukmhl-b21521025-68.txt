48 ARTICULATIONS OF UPPER EXTREMITY. culations. There is a synovial membrane common to the whole, and four ligaments connect them toge- ther. 1. and 2. The Anterior and Posterior Ligaments are short fibres which pass from one row to the other. 3. and 4. The External and Internal Lateral Ligaments are properly continuations of the lateral ligaments of the radio-carpal articulation. ARTICULATION OP THE METACARPAL WITH THE CARPAL BONES, AND WITH EACH OTHER. The first, or metacarpal bone of the thumb, is connected to the trapezium by a distinct synovial membrane and capsular ligament. The other four metacarpal bones are connected to the carpus by continuations of the anterior and posterior carpal ligaments. The four last metacarpal bones are connected at their carpal ends by small synovial sacs, and by transverse dorsal and palmar ligaments; at their distal extremities there are transverse palmar and dorsal ligaments and also inter-transverse, which pass from one bone to another.

OPTHALMIC ARTERY. 155 the two carotids, have already been mentioned, (vide external carotid, p. 150.) In the neck the internal carotid does not usually give off any branches; in the temporal bone it only gives twigs to the tympanum. The relative position of the parts within the cavernous sinus is as follows: —the artery lies next the sella turcica, the venous blood to the outer side of this, the third pair of nerves above, the fourth next, then the first division of the fifth, lastly the sixth; while in the sinus it gives off small branches, called the Arterise Recep- taculi. As it leaves the sinus, and after it has pierced the dura mater, it has the optic nerve to its inner side, and the motor oculi to its outer. Four branches are derived from the internal carotid. 1. Arteria Ophthalmica, 2. Arteria Communicans Posterior, 3. Arteria Cerebri Media, 4. Arteria Cerebri Anterior. 1. The Ophthalmic Artery, having entered the orbit through the foramen opticum with the optic nerve, gives off eleven branches, which are divided into—1st. Those which are given off on the outer side of the optic nerve; 2nd. Those given off above the nerve; 3rd. Those given off on the inner side of the nerve.

ARTICULATIONS OF RIBS. 39 4. The Posterior Portion of the Circular Liga- ment. The occipital bone, though not in contact with, is connected to, the second vertebra by three liga- ments. 1. The Perpendicular, which is properly a conti- nuation of the common posterior ligament; it extends from the odontoid process, or rather from the trans- verse ligament, to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. 2. and 3. The Alar or Moderator Ligaments, which extend from the odontoid process to the sides of the foramen magnum. The atlas and dentata are connected to each other by the capsular ligaments common to the other vertebrae, and also by the odontoid process, which is attached to the atlas by two synovial sacs and the Transverse Ligament* ARTICULATIONS OF THE RIBS. The head of each rib is connected to the bodies of the two adjoining vertebrae, and the intervening * The anterior and posterior ligaments, which connect the bodies of the Atlas and Axis, are by some described aB the ante- rior and posterior atlo-axoid ligaments; they are, however, only continuations of the common anterior and posterior ligaments.

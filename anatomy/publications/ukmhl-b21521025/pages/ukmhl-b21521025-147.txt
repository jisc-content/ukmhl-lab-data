F A S C I JE. I am induced to give a short description of the dif- ferent Fasciae, not only on account of their impor- tance, but because I know of no part of anatomy which students generally find more difficult to under- stand. This arises not so much from the abstruse- ness of the subject itself, as from the plan which is usually adopted in the description of these various parts, and the distinct names given to each of them, by which the student is apt to consider the fasciae as so many separate and unconnected structures, precisely as he does so many muscles, with distinct origins and insertions; whereas, for the most part, they form portions of one continuous tissue, different names being necessary for describing and localizing each division. All fasciae form a part of one of three series: 1st.—The Superficial Fasciae; 2nd.—Fasciae of a denser and more aponeurotic character, inti- mately connected with muscular fibre, and in a great measure derived from it, as the fascia lumborum, and those of the extremities ; 3rd.—Fasciae deeply seated, but in structure nearly resembling the superficial, as the fascia transversalis, fascia iliaca, &c. To comprehend with clearness and accuracy the

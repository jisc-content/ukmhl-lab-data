236 SEMILUNAR GANGLION AND ITS BRANCHES. pass inwards and form a plexus upon the aorta ; they also send branches to enter the various plexuses, formed principally from the solar plexus. The lum- bar ganglia are connected to each other by small filaments, the first being united to the last thoracic ganglion, and the last lumbar being connected to the first sacral. The Sacral Ganglia are three or four in num- ber ; they occupy the anterior sacral holes, conse- quently converge as they pass downwards ; they all send branches to communicate with the sacral nerves, and to enter into the hypogastric and pelvic plexuses, which they assist in forming. The inferior ganglion on each side sends branches, which, in the median line, on the sacro- coccygeal ligament, unite in a small ganglion (Gan- glion Impar); thus completing the chain inferiorly, as the ganglion of Ribes does superiorly. SEMILUNAR GANGLION AND ITS BRANCHES. The Semilunar is by far the largest of the sym- pathetic ganglia, it is situated upon the crus of the diaphragm, to the inner side of the supra-renal capsule, and lies partly upon the aorta; the two semilunar ganglia communicate with each other by many filaments, which form an areolated web stud-

CERVICAL NERVES. 213 converge as they proceed obliquely downwards and outwards to the inter-vertebral foramina; within this, the posterior root swells out into a small oval gan- gliform enlargement, to which the anterior root is closely applied. Immediately to the outer side of this ganglion the two portions are completely united into one cord, constituting the proper spinal nerve. The nerves having passed out from between the vertebrae, divide into anterior and posterior branches; the latter of which, (except the first and second cervical), are very much smaller than the anterior, and are distributed to the muscles and integuments upon the posterior surface of the body. All the spinal nerves communicate with each other and with the sympathetic. The spinal nerves are classed according to the vertebrae between which they issue from the canal ; thus we have eight cervical, twelve dorsal, five lumbar, and five sacral nerves. The first cervical escapes between the occipital bone and the first vertebra, and is frequently called the sub-occipital, in which case the cervical nerves will be enumerated as only seven. CERVICAL NERVES. The First Cervical or Sub-occipital Nerve leaves the spinal canal between the atlas and occipital bone, and like the other spinal nerves divides into a

190 VENA VORTM. VENA VORTM. The Vena Portae in many respects resembles an artery, for though it contains venous blood, yet, unlike all other veins, it conveys the blood for minute distribution. All the blood which has circu- lated through the chylopoietic viscera, except the liver, by the three great arteries which arise from the abdominal aorta, viz; the celiac axis, and the supe- rior and inferior mesenteric arteries, is poured into it. Within the root of the meso-colon, upon the second dorsal vertebra, the inferior and superior mesen- teric veins join, the trunk passes upwards with the superior mesenteric artery behind the pancreas, where it meets with the large splenic vein, which returns the blood from the stomach, spleen, pancreas, and duodenum. The union of these two veins constitutes the Vena Portae ; this takes a transverse direction before the aorta, and behind the pancreas; it reaches the smaller omentum, within the folds of which, it mounts in company with the hepatic duct and artery, (the duct being to the right, the artery to the left, and the vein in the middle, but posterior to both,) surrounded by Glisson's capsule, to the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into two branches ; to this portion of the vein the term sinus of the vena portae is given ; one branch enters into the right, the other into the left lobe of the liver, to be

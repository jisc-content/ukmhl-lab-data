177 PLANTAR ARTERIES. the posterior tibial artery divides into the internal and external plantar arteries. The inner of these branches is small, and runs above the abductor pol- licis to supply the inner side of the foot. The exter- nal plantar artery is much larger and more deeply placed among the muscles in the sole of the foot; it forms an arch by passing, at first, towards the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, then inwards, to the space between the first and second bones; from it several branches arise to supply these muscles, and also four digital arteries, which supply the outer side of the second, and the whole of the three outer toes with blood; the great and the inner side of the second toe are supplied by the anterior tibial artery.

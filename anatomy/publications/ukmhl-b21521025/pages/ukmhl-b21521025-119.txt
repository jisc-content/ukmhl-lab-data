MUSCLES ON POSTERIOR PART OF LEG. 99 condyle; the muscle forms, with the solffius, a com- mon tendon (tendo achillis), which is inserted into the tuberosity of the os calcis. The Plantaris arises from the femur, above the external condyle; it is inserted into the posterior part of the os calcis. The SoLiEus has a double origin: the outer or larger head arises from the posterior surface of the head, and upper third of the fibula ; the inner head arises from the posterior surface of the tibia, below the insertion of the poplitaeus; it is inserted by the tendo achillis into the lower and hinder part of the calcis. The Poplit^us arises from a depression on the outer and lower part of the external condyle; it is inserted into the posterior and upper part of the tibia, above the popliteal ridge. The Flexor Digitorum Longus arises from the posterior surface of the tibia, below the insertion of the poplitaeus; it becomes tendinous, and passes behind the inner malleolus with the tibialis posticus, into the sole of the foot, where it expands and receives the insertion of the musculus accessorius; it then divides into four tendons, which, after passing through fissures in the short flexor tendons, are inserted into the last phalanges of the four outer toes. The Tibialis Posticus arises from the upper part of the tibia, from the upper and inner part of the fibula, and from a great portion of the inter-osseous ligament ; it is principally inserted into the os sea-

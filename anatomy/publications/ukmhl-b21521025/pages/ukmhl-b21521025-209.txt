VEINS OF LOWER EXTREMITY. 189 The veins which accompany the anterior and posterior tibial arteries unite together in the ham to form the popliteal- vein, which is somewhat super- ficial and external to the artery; having passed through the opening in the adductor muscle to the fore part of the thigh, it constitutes the femoral vein. At the groin, as this passes under poupart's ligament, it becomes the external iliac, which lies to the inner side of the artery, having, in its passage up the thigh, gradually acquired this position. The INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ILIAC VEINS, with their branches, correspond to their respective arteries; they unite upon the sacro-iliac synchondrosis to form the common iliac vein. The left common iliac vein is somewhat longer than the right, and passes under the right common iliac artery, to join with the right vein at the lower edge of the fourth lumbar vertebra; this junction forms the ascending cava. The Vena Cava Ascendens passes on the right of the aorta, upon the left psoas muscle, and the left crus of the diaphragm, through a fissure in the liver, to the large tendinous opening of the diaphragm; having traversed which, it immediately opens into the right auricle. In this course it receives the Middle Sacral, Lumbar, Spermatic, Renal, Hepatic, and Phrenic Veins.

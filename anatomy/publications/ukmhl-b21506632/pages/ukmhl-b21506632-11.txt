PEEFACE. The value of drawing as a training for the hand and the eye has scarcely been sufficiently recognised by our medical schools. Some years ago the Author ventured to draw attention to the value of drawing, as a means of acquiring and retaining that exact knowledge of detail which each year more and more over- taxes the student.1 These ' Outlines' are a first endeavour to bring these views to a test, and to supply an existing want. The object of the present work is to enable the student of Human Anatomy to record in simple outline the more important structures his scalpel lays bare in the course of his dissections. By the plan here suggested, the patience and skill he displays in making a good dissection are at once turned to practical account, for a few lines made with his pencil will preserve the results of his labour in a permanent form. Facts in anatomy should be impressed on the mind by appeal- ing to the eye, and the practice of drawing a dissection is among the best of all methods for attaining this end. It impresses in a clear and definite manner the numerous details it is necessary to remember. In reading an anatomical description, the mind of the student instantly creates an image. An illustration therefore becomes of the first importance in helping him to shape it aright. He will remember more surely by depicting his dissections, and his knowledge will be more complete and lasting. ' Lancet, Oct. 24, 1868.

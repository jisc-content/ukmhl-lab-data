L'LATE LXX11 FRONT VIEW OF THORAX WITH VISCERA. I. The heart may be mapped out in the following man- ner :â€”A line drawn across the sternum about the level of the third costal cartilages, passing half an inch to the right and one inch to the left, will indicate the position of the base from which the great vessels arise. The apex usually strikes the chest wall between the fifth and sixth ribs on the left side, at a spot about a couple of inches below the nipple, and one inch to its sternal side. The lower border is formed by the right ventricle, and rests on the central tendon of the diaphragm. It is defined by a line curving downwards, commencing at the apex and crossing close to the sterno-xiphoid articulation, and terminating at the right edge of the sternum near its junction with the sixth cartilage. The lateral borders of the heart may be completed by drawing curved lines upwards from the points last named to the ends of the basal line. The right border consists entirely of right auricle and the left of the left ventricle.

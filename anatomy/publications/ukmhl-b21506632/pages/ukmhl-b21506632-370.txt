FLATE LXXXV. The prostate is a muscular and glandular body surrounding the neck of the bladder and the prostatic urethra. It is of a rounded three-sided shape, measuring about one inch and a half across, one inch and a quarter from base to apex, and one inch in thickness. Its base, which is thick and notched in the middle, is directed backwards, being situated between the apex of the trigone and the bend at the junction of the second and third pieces of rectum. Its apex passes as far forwards as the middle of the base of the triangular ligament. The prostate consists of two large lateral lobes and a smaller middle lobe, which is placed between these and the neck of the bladder. In old men this lobe often becomes hypertrophied, and projects forwards so as to narrow or almost close the urethral orifice. In this condition it impedes the passage of an instrument. The urethra passes through the gland near its upper surface, and the ejaculatory ducts pierce it obliquely to open into the urethra. This organ consists chiefly of plain muscular fibres, in which the sacculated glands and their elongated ducts are imbedded. Running backwards from the sinus pocularis for about a quarter of an inch beneath the middle lobe of the prostate is a cul de sac called the prostatic sinus. This is named also uterus masculinus, being homologous with the female uterus. The prostate has a capsule of its own as well as a special sheath, derived from the recto-vesical fascia. Between these investments there is a quantity of loose areolar tissue and the prostatic plexus of veins, which receives in front the dorsal vein of the penis. Its upper surface is in relation with the neck of the bladderâ€” with the pubo-prostatic ligaments and dorsal vein of the penis. About two inches behind its base and rather above it is the lower end of the recto-vesical pouch. Its base is placed on the fore part of the rectum, at the bend between its second and third portions.

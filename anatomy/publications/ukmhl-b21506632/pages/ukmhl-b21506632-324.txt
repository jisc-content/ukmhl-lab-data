PLATE LXXIII. in length. It passes obliquely downwards into the lung below the corresponding pulmonary artery. The duodenum is the largest part of the small in- testine. It describes a curve somewhat resembling a horseshoe with the convexity to the right. The head of the pancreas is included within its curve. The first portion is in contact with the liver, which overlaps it, and terminates at the neck of the gall-bladder. The second portion descends to about the level of the third lumbar vertebra, having the colon in front and the right kidney behind. The common bile duct opens into this part of the duodenum in common with the pancreatic duct. The third portion crosses the spine and great vessels obliquely, the superior mesenteric artery passing down- wards in front. It terminates on the left side of the body of the second lumbar vertebra. The pancreas is placed obliquely across the abdomen opposite the second lumbar vertebra. Its head is em- braced by the duodenum. The body is in contact with the spine, crura of diaphragm, and aorta, and its tail passes in front of the left kidney and supra-renal capsule, and touches the spleen. The pancreas lies behind the stomach. In this plate the spleen and splenic artery, the pyloric opening of the stomach, common bile &ndpancreatic ductst are also indicated.

PREFACE. viii The Author believes that a student who follows the advice here given will find his labour lightened, and seldom wasted. He will dissect with more care, and will remember with greater ease. The importance of surface anatomy in its relation to surgery cannot be over-estimated. The learner anxious to commence his dissection is apt to neglect superficial landmarks. These are the guides, however, which lead the surgeon surely and safely to the deeper structures which he exposes in operations. They are, moreover, of the highest importance in the diagnosis of fractures and dislocations. These ' Outlines,' it is hoped, will assist in train- ing the eye to a correct knowledge of this branch of anatomy. It bears directly on the success of future work, and it is well when this is early recognised. To those who have finished their work in the dissecting-room, who are learning the practice of surgery in the hospital ward and in the operating theatre, the ' Outlines,' it is believed, will be of service. The curved incision commonly used for removal of the wrist-joint, for example, requires a knowledge of the parts beneath. This can be shown by a line, and its exact relation to the bony points clearly perceived. The structures which are cut through, and those which should be avoided during the operation, can all be filled in. An operation is thus seen, as it were, and the student can appreciate its anatomical bearings, almost as thoroughly as if he had performed it on the dead subject. Such practice cannot fail to be useful to him when his skill is called for in the removal of actual disease. Surgery should never be divorced from anatomy, as it too often is. From the first, the two should rather go hand in hand. A practical teacher would desire to hear more of surgery in the dissecting-room and more of anatomy in the ward. The highest aim and the real endeavour of all anatomical teaching should be to send into the world sound practitioners rather than accomplished

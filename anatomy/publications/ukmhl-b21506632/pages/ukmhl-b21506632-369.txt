PLATE LXXXV. but when distended it is conical, with the base below resting on the rectum, and the apex inclined upwards towards the abdominal wall. The top of the bladder is usually below the level of the pubes ; but when distended it rises out of the pelvis, and may- reach as high or even higher than the umbilicus. The front part is not covered by peritoneeum, so that when distended it may be cut into without wounding the membrane. In the female the bladder is separated from the rectum by the vagina and uterus ; but in the male, its base rests on the front of the middle portion of the rectum. This part of the viscus has a triangular shape, and corresponds with the smooth trigone of the inner surface. Its boundaries are described in connection with the rectum. The ureters pass obliquely through the walls of the bladder, opening into it at the extremities of the base of the trigone. There is an elevation of the mucous membrane and subjacent tissue, at the apex of the trigone, called the uvula vesicae—it is caused by the projection of the middle lobe of the prostate. The median ridge of the veru montanum is prolonged forwards from the uvula. At its front end is the sinus pocularis, leading into the prostatic vesicle (uterus masculmus). Just within the margins of the sinus are the slit-like openings of the ejacidatory ducts—one on either side. There is a shallow groove (prostatic sinus) on each side of the veru montanum ; at the bottom of this are numerous (12 to 20) small openings of the prostatic ducts ; those of the middle lobe open behind the uvula. The neck of the bladder is a term rather loosely applied to the narrow anterior'part adjacent to the urethra, where it is sur- rounded by the prostate. At the junction of its floor with the arethra is a well-marked projection, causing a narrowing of the urethra. This is the widest of the three urethral narrowings.

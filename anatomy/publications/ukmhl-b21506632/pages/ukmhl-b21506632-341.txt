I'LATK LXXVIH. FRONT VIEW OF ABDOMEN, WITH VISCERA. II. The liver is the largest of the abdominal organs. It occupies the three upper regions of the abdomen; its convex upper sur- face being chiefly covered by the vault of the diaphragm, but in front in the middle line it comes in contact for a variable dis- tance with the abdominal parietes. Above the diaj)hragm the liver is overlapped by the thin margin of the right lung. It is in con- tact below with the pyloric extremity of the stomach, but if this organ be empty it covers it as far even as the cardiac end. The first portion of the duodenum, hepatic flexure of colon, the right kidney and its supra-renal capsule, are all in contact with the under surface of the right lobe. The liver descends an inch or more in the upright position. In the recumbent position it ascends, and is almost hidden behind the lower ribs and their cartilages except in the middle line. This organ is depressed in inspiration, but it is raised upwards when the stomach or intestines are distended. The fundus of the gall bladder corresponds to the ninth costal cartilage of the right side. The highest part of the liver on the right side is level in front with the fifth rib cartilage at the n^jpple line. In the mid- axillary line it comes to the surface at the level of the ninth rib. Halfway between these points its upper border is level with the seventh rib. Behind, in the line of the inferior angle of the scapula, it comes to the surface at the level of the eleventli rib.

I'LATF, LXXII. joint fairly indicates the line of the left carotid artery. The pulmonary artery is a short trunk proceeding from a point opposite the junction of the third left cartilage with the sternum towards the upper border of the second left cartilage (pulmonary cartilage). The kidneys are placed at the back of the abdomen, occupying the right and left lumbar regions. Their anterior surfaces look somewhat outwards as well as forwards. Their upper ends are the larger, and are nearer to the middle line. The right kidney is in relation with the duodenum and colon in front, and touches the liver above. The left kidney is covered by the colon and the tail of the pancreas, and touches the spleen above. They are each surmounted by a supra-renal capsule, and are in contact posteriorly with the pillars of the diaphragm, psoas, and quadratus lumborum muscles. The kidneys correspond in height to the two lower dorsal and two upper lumbar vertebra?. The left reaches as high as the upper border of the eleventh rib, whilst the right only reaches to the lower border. They are movable organs, being slightly depressed by the diaphragm during a deep inspiration. In this plate the lungs are represented with the diaphragm as they would appear in the dead body. The aorta, supra-renal capsules are also indicated.

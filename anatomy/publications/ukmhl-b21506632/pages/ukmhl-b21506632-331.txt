This may be mapped out on the front of the chest by a line drawn from the fourth rib at the midaxilla to the midsternal line at the third costal cartilage. The diaphragm and its levels.â€”The central tendon of the diaphragm supports the heart, portions of the right and left ventricles equally sharing this connection. This part of the muscle is lower than either of the lateral arches, and the right arch is about an inch higher than the left. The sur- face line of attachment proceeds from the tip of the xiphoid cartilage along the seventh cartilage and those of the remaining ribs to the first lumbar spine. The lungs being slightly dis- tended, the'central tendon is on a level with the sterno-xiphoid articulation. Measured from the front, the right arch reaches as high as the fifth cartilage. In the midaxillary line it is level with the ninth rib. Halfway between these points it reaches as high as the seventh rib ; and behind, in the scapular line, it is as low as the eleventh : 5, 7, 9, 11 is a useful clinical formula for this arch as well as for the upper limit of the liver, which fits into the concavity of its under surface. The left arch in the midaxillary line is level with the tenth rib ; in front it reaches as high as the sixth cartilage. In tranquil inspiration the arches descend for about half an inch, the central tendon remaining nearly stationary. In forced expiration the right arch extends upwards in front as high as the fourth cartilage. The left arch reaches up to about the fourth interspace. The. spleen is placed on the left side, between the great end of the stomach and the diaphragm. It corresponds, when not enlarged, to the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs in the lino of the axilla, but it varies in size perhaps more than any other organ in the body. The thin edge of the left Lung overlaps il above. The

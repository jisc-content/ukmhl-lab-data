PLATE LXXll. The pulmonary semilunar valves, which are anterior in position to the aortic, are placed behind the junction of the cartilage of the third rib with the sternum on the left side. The aortic semilunar valves, more deeply placed, cor- respond to the third space close to the sternum. The tricuspid valve is situated behind the sternum, near the middle line, about the level of the fourth costal cartilage. The mitral valve lies deeply behind the third intercostal space, one inch to the left of the sternum. The aortic arch in the first part of its course extends from the left to the right behind the sternum. Starting from the third left interspace close to the sternum, it passes to the upper border of the second right cartilage (aortic cartilage) close to the sternum. The second or transverse part of the arch passes backwards, and to the left from the point last named to the left side of the body of the third dorsal vertebra. It crosses the trachea just above the bifurcation. At the middle of this course it reaches its highest point, about one inch below the toj:> of the sternum. The third or descending passes to the lower border of the fourth or fifth dorsal vertebra on the left side, where it is arbitrarily said to become the thoracic aorta. The innominate artery may be traced by a line passing from about the middle of the junction of the first and second piece of the sternum to the right sterno-clavicular articulation, where it divides into subclavian and common carotid branches.

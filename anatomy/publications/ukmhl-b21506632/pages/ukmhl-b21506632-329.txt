PLATES LXXJV. LXXV. LXXVI, FRONT, BACK, AND SIDE VIEWS OF THORAX AND ABDOMEN, WITH VISCERA. The lungs, when distended by an ordinary inspiration (as seen in those figures in which they are shaded), may be described as follows :â€” The apex extends upwards for about one inch above the sternal end of the clavicle, fitting into the concavity of the arch of the subclavian artery. In this situation it is covered by the anterior scalene and sterno-mastoid muscles. The anterior edge passes from the apex to the sternal end of the clavicle ; thence it inclines inwards, reaching the median line at the junction of the first and second pieces of the sternum, i. e. on a level with the second rib cartilage. At this point it comes into close contact with the edge of the opposite lung, and the two run together behind the sternum as far as the level of the fourth costal cartilage. In this extent they arc not quite parallel, for the right lung com- monly bulges over to the left side. The edge of the right lung continues nearly in the midsternal line as far down as the Level of the sixth cartilage, behind which it passes abruptly outwards, forming the commencement of the base. The left lung leaves the midsternal line at the level of the fourth cartilage, passing obliquely downwards and outwards to 1 he junction of (he fifth cartilage with its rib ; thence it proceeds

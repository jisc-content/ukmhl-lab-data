PLATE LXXVIII. In the median line, and to the left, the upper border of the liver is contiguous to the lower border of the heart, only the tendon of the diaphragm intervening. On percussion, the areas of hepatic and cardiac dulness are continuous. When the stomach is undistended it is covered by the left lobe of the liver, the lower edge of which is placed behind the linea alba, about halfway between the xiphoid cartilage and the umbilicus. The lower edge of the liver may be marked on the surface by a line drawn from the tip of the tenth right cartilage, across the linea alba, at the level just mentioned, upwards to the tip of the ninth left cartilage. The large intestine, about Jive feet in length, commences in the right iliac fossa, and terminates on the surface at the anus. In its arched course it surrounds the convolutions of the small intestine. It has been arbitrarily divided into coscum—ascending, transverse, and descending colon, sigmoid flexure, and rectum. The coscum and ascending colon are placed superficially in the right iliac, lumbar, and hypochondriac regions. The descending colon lies more deeply at the back of the abdomen, hi the corresponding regions of the left side. The transverse colon (arch of the colon) crosses the umbilical region in its passage from the left to the right hypochondriac regions. Here it is covered by the ribs, and is overlapped on the right side by the liver, and on the left comes in contact with the spleen. The sigmoid flexure occupies the left iliac fossa, and the rectum is confined to the true pelvis. The large intestine is capable of undergoing considerable dis- tension. The transverse colon is very movable, so again is the sigmoid flexure. According to Dr. Bright,1 of all the viscera of the abdomen the colon is the one which varies most in its position. 1 ' Observations on Abdominal Tumours.'—Guy's Ilosjrital Reports.

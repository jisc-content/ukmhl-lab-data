PLATE LXXIII. FRONT VIEW OF THORAX WITH VISCERA. II. The oesophagus is about nine inches long. It com- mences in the middle line opposite the lower border of the fifth cervical vertebra. In its course downwards it deviates slightly to the left at the root of the neck, but regains the middle line opposite the fifth dorsal vertebra. From this position it passes again to the left, and curving forwards reaches the opening in the diaphragm on a level with the ninth dorsal vertebra. The oesophagus, more- over, whilst in relation with the spine follows its curves. It is a closed tube when at rest, being flattened from before backwards. The trachea is from four to five inches in length. It extends from the cricoid cartilage opposite the lower part of the body of the fifth cervical to the corresponding part of the fourth or even fifth dorsal vertebra. Here it divides into the two bronchi. The right bronchus is the larger, and about one inch in length. It passes almost trans- versely outwards, being the highest constituent of the root of tli*' righl lung. The left bronchus is about two inches

PLATE LVII. LIGAMENTS, ETC., OF HIP-JOINT AND THYROID FORAMEN. Hip-joint. Cotyloid. Transverse. Teres. Capsular (posterior portion to neck of femur). Thyroid Foramen. Obturator membrane. Note.â€”The figures indicate the position and number of the centres of ossifica- tion, and the average time at which these make their appearance. The upright figures denote years, the sloping figures months, except when followed by a W, when weeks are intended. All sloping figures therefore refer to a period before birth. A solid arrow serves to show the manner in which the chief centres coalesce ; the time at which this union takes place being shown by figures between their points. The dotted arrows > point to the period at which the epiphyses join these or the shaft.

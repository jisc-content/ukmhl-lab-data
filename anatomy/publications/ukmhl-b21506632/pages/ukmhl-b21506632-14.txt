SCHOOL ADVICE. The student is advised, after commencing the dissection of a region, to indicate on the ' outline ' the incisions he has made in order to reflect the skin. In this way the part he is ahout to fill in is marked out, and he follows with his pencil the incisions he has previously made with his scalpel. It will be well, as his dissection progresses, first to outline the muscles, having previously ascertained as far as possible their exact attachments by dissection. Their general shape and superficial limits may be shown by continuous lines ; their attachments beneath, which are often ascertained best after division, may be shown by dotted lines. The arteries, important veins, and nerves may then be added. Wherever these are hidden by overlying structures, tbeir course can be in- dicated by dotted lines. At his leisure he may complete his drawing. This is most satisfactorily done by using for the muscles thin washes of transparent colours. The arteries and veins may be shown in darker tints. The ligaments and tendons may be coloured with gamboge, and the nerves afterwards picked out with Chinese white, or with some other colour. If the deeper muscles be coloured in with a wash of blue, and those more superficial with a wash of lake, a transparent drawing is made, which will show not only the origin and insertion of the muscles, with their deeper connections, but the relation of all these to the skeleton beneath, and often their bearing on surface form. The structures which it is thought expedient to portray in each

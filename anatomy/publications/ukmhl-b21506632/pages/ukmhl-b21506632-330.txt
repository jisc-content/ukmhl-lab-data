PLATES LXXIV. LXXV. LXXVI. inwards to the middle of the sixth, behind which it slopes out- Avards, forming the basal line. This notch in the left lung is of a quadrilateral shape, its lower boundary being formed by the liver (the diaphragm intervening). It leaves a considerable portion of the anterior wall of the right ventricle uncovered by lung and separated from the chest wall only by the pericardium. This is the prajcordial region. The base of the right lung passes outwards behind the sixth cartilage in front, reaching the level of the ninth rib in the mid- axillary line. Behind, in the line of the inferior angle of the scapula it passes downwards as low as the tenth rib ; being- buoyed up by the liver, it does not extend so low down as the left base. This is level with the tenth rib in the midaxillary line and behind in the scapular line as low as the eleventh rib. The posterior borders are separated along their whole length by a considerable interval, the front of the bodies of the vertebrae projecting, as it were, between them. A line drawn along the vertebral groove, about an inch external to the line of the spines from the first to the eleventh dorsal spinous processes, will map out the posterior border. The main sulcus, dividing the lung into two lobes, passes from the anterior border near the base to the posterior border near the apex. To mark this on the surface of the body a line should be drawn from the junction of the sixth cartilage with the sternum obliquely upwards and outwards, crossing the fourth rib in the midaxilla. Thence it is to be prolonged upwards and inwards along the back, so that it may hit the posterior edge of the lung at the level of the third dorsal spinous process, the guide to which is the obtuse angle at the root of the scapular spine. The upper division of the right lung is subdivided into two lobes by a fissure passing from the middle of the anterior border

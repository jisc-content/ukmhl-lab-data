The student who fills in and completes these ' Outlines,' guided by his actual dissections, will easily manage to illustrate nearly all he sees of an operation—and he will be doing much to place anatomy and surgery in their true relations one to the other in the system of medical study. The Author wishes to express his great obligations to his friend Mr. Arthur E. Fisher, whose patience, artistic knowledge, and careful work have so largely contributed to the value of these ' Out- lines.'

Stuart, of the Liverpool School, for several valuable suggestions. •33 Harley Street, Cavendish- Square, W. January 1st, 1878. a

1'LATK LX.WII. FRONT VIEW OF ABDOMEN WITH VISCERA. I. The stomach varies very much in size. It occupies the three upper regions of the abdomen, but only a small portion of the left hypochondrium. It is placed beneath the diaphragm, the left lobe of the liver intervening near the pyloric end. When distended the stomach comes in contact with the abdominal walls in the epigastric region (pit of the stomach). The spleen lies to the left, the pancreas behind, and the colon below. The cardiac orifice is comparatively fixed. It lies more deeply, and at a higher level than the pyloric orifice, which is much more movable. As the stomach becomes distended the great curvature is earned forwards and upwards. The lesser curvature is subject to very limited movements, being steadily held in position by the lesser omentum. The cardiac orifice lies to the left of the middle line, a little below the sternal end of the seventh costal cartilage.

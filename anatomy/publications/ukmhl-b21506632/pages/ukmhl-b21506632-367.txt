PLATE LXXXV. SIDE VIEW OF PELVIS WITH VISCERA {MALE). The rectum is about eight inches long, extending from the sigmoid flexure of the colon to the anus. For convenience of description it is divided into three parts. The upper portion is about three and a half inches long. It passes from the left sacro-iliac joint to the middle of the sacrum (third vertebral segment), and is the narrowest part of the gut. It is completely invested by a fold of peritoneum (meso-rec- tum) which connects it to the sacrum. In the female the recto- vaginal peritoneal pouch separates it from the back of the uterus and the upper part of the vagina. Below this the vagina is separated from the front of the rectum only by some loose oreolar tissue. In the male the recto-vesical pouch intervenes between it and the back of the bladder. The lower end of this pouch is usually situated about two inches behind the base of the prostate, and double the distance from the anus. It is well, however, to remember that its position is not constant, for it is often much nearer the prostate. Hence puncture of the bladder per rectum is a hazardous operation, for should the pouch be pierced, death usually results. It is for these reasons many surgeons prefer supra-pubic aspiration to relieve the over-distended organ. Near the end of this portion of the gut on the right side is a projecting fold of mucous membrane, enclosing muscular fibres named Houston's Fold.

The dissection or the teacher's own outline will serve as a copy, or the tracings may be used by those students who possess but slight knowledge of drawing. The outlines may be coloured in or more highly finished before the class meets again. By this plan, when a student commences his dissections, he has already overcome many of his difficulties, and he will be better able to fill in the outlines from his own dissections. The author must express his best thanks to Messrs. Longman and Co. for their willing efforts to issue the work at a very moderate cost, and to Messrs. Leitch and Co. for the care they have bestowed on the plates. He must again express his obli- gations to his friend Mr. A. E. Fiseier for his generous assistance, without which the cost of the Parts must have been largely in- creased. To his friend and colleague in the dissecting-room, Mr. J. Bland Sutton, he owes much for his valuable assistance and advice. 33 Harley Street, Cavendish Square, W. April 12th, 1880.

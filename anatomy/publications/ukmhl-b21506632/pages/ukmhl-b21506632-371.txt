PLATE LXXXV. At the apex of the trigone it is in contact with the vesicular semi- nales and the vasa defermtia. On passing the finger into the gut for about two inches, the prostate can be felt as a hard projection through the front wall of the rectum. Its apex surrounds the urethra, and is connected to the pos- terior deep layer of the triangular ligament. A little distance in front of it is the bulb of the corpus spongiosum. Its under surface corresponds to the central perinatal raj)he and central point of perinaauni. It is supported by the anterior fibres of levator ani (levator prostataj). On each side the anterior fibres of the levator ani pass down to unite beneath it in the middle line.

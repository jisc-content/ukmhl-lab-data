PLATE LXXXV. The middle portion of the rectum is continued downAvards for about three inches, following the curve of the sacrum. It is covered by peritoneum for a short distance in front, and on each side, beyond this and in front, is the trigone of the base of the bladder, which is bounded behind by the end of the recto-vesical pouch ; on each side by the vas deferens with the seminal vesicle ; and in front, at its apex, by the base of the prostate. In tapping the bladder by the rectum, the point of the trochar is thrust through its upper wall and the trigone just behind the prostate. This part of the gut is usually distended. At its commencement, on the left side, is the second of Houston's folds. The first projects from the fore part of the middle of this portion of the gut, opposite the base of the bladder, and about three inches from the anus. In passing an instrument up the bowel, the position of these folds should be borne in mind. The lower portion is about an inch and a half in length. From the anterior part of the prostate it curves backwards, round the tip of the coccyx to the anus. Here it is narrowest, but it is unduly dilated above. It has no peritoneal investment. Its lower end is surrounded by the sphincter and slung up by the levator ani. It presents several longitudinal folds (columns of Morgagni), due to the heaping up of longitudinal muscuLir fibres. At the junction of the skin and mucous membrane is a thickened white line. It corresponds to the interval between the internal and external sphincter muscles. The internal sphincter extends upwards beneath the mucous membrane for about an inch above the white line. The lower three inches of the rectum is supported and surrounded by a sheath derived from the recto- vesical fascia. The bladder is placed in the fore part of the pelvis, close to its anterior wall. In the empty state it has a triangular shape ;

THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH s T. 0. & E. C. JACK; and M HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. UPPER LIMB. ARTICULATIONS—No. 2. LIGAMENTS OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW, SEEN FROM BEHIND. THREE SPECIMENS. A. The acromio-clavicular capsular ligament (1) requires no further description. (See No. 1). The suprascapular, or transverse, ligament (2) bridges over the suprascapular notch, and forms a foramen which transmits the suprascapular nerve. The posterior band of the coraco-clavicular ligament, or conoid band (3) passes from the root of the coracoid to the conoid tubercle of the clavicle. The glenoid ligament (5) is a rim of fibro-cartilage which surrounds and deepens the glenoid fossa, and gives attachment to the capsular ligament of the shoulder (6). B. The posterior ligament of the elbow-joint is attached above to the back of the humerus above the olecranon fossa, and to the back of the condyles on either side, and passes down to be attached to the olecranon process around the margin of the articular surface. C. The internal lateral ligament is triangular in shape, passing from the lower part of the internal condyle above to the inner aspect c)f the olecranon process (9), while another band passes to the inner margin of the coronoid process (10). A third band passes from the olecranon to the coronoid process, and joins the lower ends of the former bands to one another, bridging over a small channel which transmits some small articular vessels. The figures indicate ligaments and tendons— In A. 1. Superior acromio-clavicular. 6. Capsular ligament of shoulder. 2. Suprascapular. 7. Infraspinatus. 3. Conoid. In B. 8.

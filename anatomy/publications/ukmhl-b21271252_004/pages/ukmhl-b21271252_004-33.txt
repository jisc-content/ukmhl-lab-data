THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH , T. C. & E. C. JACK ; ant. 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. UPPER LIMB. AXILLA.—No. 4. THE ANTERIOR WALL OF THE AXILLA HAS BEEN REMOVED, TO SHOW THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE STRUCTURES WITHIN THE CAVITY. The axillary vessels, which are directly continuous with the subclavian, commence at the outer border of the first rib, and run down to the lower border of the teres major tendon. The lower part of the vein has been removed, in the region where it overlaps the artery, but the vein has been left in the upper part, where it lies at a lower level than the artery and on an anterior plane. The vessels rest upon the first intercostal space in the upper part, then on some areolar tissue, by which they are separated from the subscapulars muscle, and then they lie on the latissimus dorsi and teres major tendons. They are covered in front by the pectoralis major and minor muscles and by the costo-coracoid membrane. The great nerve cords of the brachial plexus lie at first above the artery, but they soon come to lie on different sides of that vessel, the inner cord on the inner side, the outer cord external to, and the posterior cord behind the artery. It will be seen, however, that the position of the posterior cord of the plexus is, at first, rather at a higher level than the other cords. The external and internal anterior thoracic nerves form a plexus around the artery. The figures indicate— Muscles. 1. Deltoid. 8. Axillary artery. 2. Pectoralis major. 9. Outer cord. 3.

THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.O. PELVIS. FEMALE PERINEUM—No. 3. THE PUBIC AKCH HAS BEEN REMOVED, WITH A PORTION OF THE PUBIC SYMPHISIS; PART OF THE OBTURATOR INTERNUS MUSCLE ON EACH SIDE HAS BEEN CUT AWAY, AND THE UPPER MARGIN OF THE LEVATORES ANI CUT SHORT. The inferior surface of the bladder is seen, with the venous plexus which surrounds the neck, from which the urethra emerges. The levator ani supports the neck of the bladder anteriorly,—some of its fibres are inserted, behind that, into the wall of the vagina, while still further back, the muscle on each side forms a thick rounded mass Avhich passes down to the central point of the perineum, and to the anal canal. The deep layer of the triangular ligament is formed by the fascia which invests the levator ani, passing across the middle line from the muscle of one side to that of the other. The fascia on the outer, or parietal, aspect of the levator ani is thin and weak, but that on its inner, or pelvic, surface is of some strength. The apex of the ischio-rectal fossa is seen, and the vessels which lie in the fascia forming the outer wall of the fossa—the internal pudic and dorsal artery of the clitoris—are seen divided. The figures indicate— 1. Urinary bladder. 7. Pubo-vesical ligaments. 2. Levator ani. • 8. Pelvic fascia. 3. Levator ani, anal fibres. 9. Alcock's canal. 4. Levator ani, anterior fibres. 10. Vesical venous plexus. 5. Obturator internus muscle. 11. Peri-urethral vascular tissue. 6. Urethra.

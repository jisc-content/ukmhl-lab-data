THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH : T. C. & E. C. JACK ; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C, UPPER LIMB. SURFACE ANATOMY—No. 5. BACK OF FOREARM. The muscular elevations and hollows here are numerous and somewhat difficult. Taking first the bony points, we find first the tip of the olecranon (1), and the external condyle of the humerus (8), below which is a depression in which the head of the radius lies. In complete extension, the tip of the olecranon process passes up as far as to a line joining the external and internal condyles of the humerus. In flexion, the olecranon passes down below this line. These facts assist greatly in differentiat- ing between a dislocation of the elbow and a fracture through the lower end of the humerus. At the wrist are the tubercle on the back of the radius (Lister's tubercle), and the lower end of the ulna. Passing down from the external condyle are the supinator longus and the two radial extensors, forming a single mass, and adjacent to them, but separated by a groove, is the common extensor of the fingers. Between these two groups in the lower part emerge the two deep extensors of the thumb (extensor ossis metacarpi and extensor primi internodii pollicis), which form an elevation on the radial border of the forearm. To the ulnar side of these muscles lies the extensor carpi ulnaris and a groove separating this muscle from the flexor carpi ulnaris. The bottom of this groove corresponds to the subcutaneous surface of the shaft of the ulna. The prominence of the anconeus muscle lies external to the outer border of the olecranon process, and passes down by the side of the shaft of the ulna. Between 3 and 4 is a small ridge, due to the belly of the extensor proprius minimi digiti. The figures indicate— 1. Olecranon process. 6. Flexor carpi ulnaris. 2. Supinator longus and radial extensors. 7. Triceps. 3. Extensor communis digitorum. 8. External condyle. 4. Extensor carpi ulnaris. 9. Lower end of ulna. 5. Anconeus. 10. Lister's tubercle on the radius.

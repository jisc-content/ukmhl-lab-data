THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY EDINBURGH: T. C. k E. €. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. UPPER LIMB. SCAPULAR REGION.—No. 2 THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE DELTOID HAS BEEN REMOVED, TO SHOW THE MUSCLES, ETC. WHICH IT COVERS. On the dorsal aspect of the scapula, below the spine of that bone, lie the infraspinatus, teres minor, and teres major muscles, while the latissimus dorsi also gains a slight origin from this surface of the bone at the lower angle. The infraspinatus muscle arises from the infraspinous fossa, excepting a small part near the neck, and from the investing fascia. The teres minor arises from an elongated flat surface on the dorsal aspect of the axillary border of the scapula, and from the adjacent intermuscular septum, while the teres major arises from an oval area on the dorsal aspect of the lower angle of the scapula. The infraspinatus and teres minor muscles pass upwards and outwards to the greater tuberosity of the humerus, covering the back of the shoulder-joint, while the teres major passes in front of the long head of the triceps and the humerus, to reach the inner lip of the bicipital groove of that bone. Those three muscles receive their nerve supply from different sources, the infraspinatus from the suprascapular nerve, the teres minor from the circumflex, and the teres major from the lower subscapular nerve. Access to the shoulder-joint from behind can be gained by separating or by dividing the infra- spinatus and teres minor muscles after reflecting the deltoid muscle. The nerves and vessels of this region are more fully exposed in the next view. The figures indicate— Muscles. 1 Trapezius. 2. Deltoid. 3. Infraspinatus. 4. Teres minor. 5. Teres major. Muscles. 6.

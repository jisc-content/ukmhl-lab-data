THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, WJL LUMBAR REGIONâ€”No. 2. ON THE RIGHT SIDE, MUSCLES AND APONEUROSIS HAVE BEEN REMOVED TO SHOW THE ERECTOR SPINjE, WHILE ON THE LEFT, THE GREATER PART OF THE ERECTOR SPINM HAS BEEN REMOVED TO SHOW THE MULTIFIDUS SPIN^E. The erector spinse muscle and prolongations from it fill up the hollow on either side of the vertebral column. The muscle itself consists of a flattened tendinous portion which lies superficially in the lumbar and sacral regions, and of a mass of fleshy tissue which lies on its anterior surface. From the origin of the muscle bands pass in different directions to gain insertion into ribs and vertebrae. The three principal columns into which the muscle divides are shown here. They are the ilio-costalis on the outer side, the longissimus dorsi in the centre, and the spinalis dorsi close to the vertebral spines. Cutaneous nerves emerge between the first two. The multifidus spinae in this region is a thick fleshy mass, covered by the erector spinse, the bundles of which it is composed passing upwards and inwards to be inserted into the vertebral spines. In front of these structures lies the quadratus lumborum, its outer margin projecting beyond that of the vertebral muscles. The lumbar aponeurosis, the middle lamella of which covers the quadratus lumborum, and which gives origin to the internal oblique and transversalis abdominis muscles, has been removed, so that the descending colon is visible, with some nerves. The figures indicate Muscles. 6. Quadratus lumborum. 1. Posterior superior iliac spine. 3. Last rib. 4. Transverse process of first lumbar vertebra. 5. Spine of second lumbar vertebra. 10.

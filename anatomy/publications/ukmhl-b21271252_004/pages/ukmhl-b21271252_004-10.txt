THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. PELVIS. FEMALE PERINEUM. —No. 4. THE SAME DISSECTION HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT AS IN NO. 3, AND A VIEW HAS BEEN TAKEN TO SHOW THE RELATION OF THE DEEPER PARTS TO THE PUBIC ARCH AND SYMPHISIS. The bladder in the female lies at a somewhat lower level in the pelvis than in the male, and the neck is situated on a plane which passes from the lower margin of the pubic symphisis in front backwards to the lower end of the sacrum. Looked at from the front, the neck of the bladder lies just below the lower margin of the symphisis pubis. The large venous plexus which lies behind the lower part of the symphisis is very liable to be injured in operations for division of the symphisis pubis. Hence it is preferable to make any division of the bone some distance to the side. The pubic arch in this specimen is a particularly good specimen of the wide female pubic angle. The figures indicate— 1. Urinary bladder. 2. Levator ani. 3. Pubo-vesical ligament and veins. 4. Urethra. 5. Levator ani, anal fibres. 6. Central point of perineum. 7. Alcock's canal.

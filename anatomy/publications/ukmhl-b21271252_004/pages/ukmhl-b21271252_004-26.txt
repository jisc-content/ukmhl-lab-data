THE SPLEEN AND LEFT KIDNEY AND POKTIONS OF THE AORTA AND (ESOPHAGUS HAVE BEEN REMOVED, TO SHOW THE HEART, ROOTS OF THE LUNGS, (ESOPHAGUS, PANCREAS, AND STOMACH, FROM BEHIND. (Esophagus. Below the bifurcation of the trachea, the oesophagus passes rather to the right, and then curves gradually forwards, and to the left side. Just above the point where it pierces the diaphragm, there is a well-marked dilatation, which is known as the ampulla phrenica. This ampulla is not invariably present, but on the other hand it may become very much enlarged, and contain fluids and food which do not reach the stomach. Between this ampulla and the stomach is a deep groove in which lay a strong muscular band, which formed part of the diaphragm, and which can probably act as the sphincter for the cardiac orifice of the stomach. The ampulla fills up the small angular interval between the diaphragm and the pericardium. The right vagus is seen passing on to the back of the oesophagus in its course to the posterior surface of the stomach. Bronchi. The left bronchus is longer, narrower, and more horizontal than the right one. Heart. The portion of the heart which is seen, includes the basal surface—the greater part of this being composed of the left auricle—and the left border, formed by the left ventricle. The great cardiac yein lies in the auriculo-ventricular groove. Stomach. The fundus of the stomach arches up above the level of the cardiac orifice. At a lower level lie the splenic vessels and the tail of the pancreas. The figures indicate— 1. Aortic arch. 2. (Esophagus. 3. Eight bronchus. 4. Left bronchus. 5. Vena azygos major. 6.

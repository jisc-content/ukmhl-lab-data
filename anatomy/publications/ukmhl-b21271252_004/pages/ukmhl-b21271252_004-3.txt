THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. PELVIS. MALE PERINEUM—No. 4. STRUCTURES BETWEEN THE LAYERS OF THE TRIANGULAR LIGAMENT. The superficial, or true, triangular ligament has been removed. Under cover of the triangular ligament is a small triangular space containing the deep transversns perinei muscle, Cowper's glands, some nerves and vessels, and the membranous portion of the urethra. The deep transversns perinei or compressor urethral muscle consists of a number of muscle fibres which arise from the pubic arch at the junction of the ischial and pubic portions, pass inwards towards the mesial plane, and are inserted into a mesial raphe, enclosing the urethra, and acting as a voluntary sphincter muscle. Cowper's glands are two small glandular structures which lie embedded in the muscle, one on each side, a short distance behind the urethra. The portion of the urethra in this region is called the membranous portion, and measures about half an inch in length. Traced inwards, the urethra passes through the deep layer of the triangular ligament, which is a portion of the pelvic fascia stretching across the pubic arch, and supporting the under part of the prostate gland. This portion of the urethra is apt to be injured in accidents causing fracture of the pelvis, and the extravasated urine is limited by the margins of the space, and often passes deeply inwards. At the sides the dorsal nerve of the penis and the internal pudic artery pass forwards, the latter giving off the artery to the bulb. The figures indicate— 1. Urethra. 2. Cowper's gland. 3. Compressor urethral 4. Levator ani. 5. External sphincter. 6. Dorsal artery of penis. 7. Transverse perineal artery. 8. Dorsal artery and nerve of penis. 9. Dorsal vein of penis. 10. Prostate plexus of veins. EDINBURGH : T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.O. Q.

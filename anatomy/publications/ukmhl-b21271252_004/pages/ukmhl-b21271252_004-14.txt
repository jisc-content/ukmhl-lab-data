THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. PELVIS. FEMALE PELVIS—No. 2. IN ADDITION TO THE PREVIOUS DISSECTION, THE RECTUM HAS BEEN DIVIDED ABOUT ITS MIDDLE, AND THE LOWER PART REMOVED WITH THE ANAL CANAL, THE LATTER HAVING BEEN SHELLED OUT FROM THE LEVATORES ANI MUSCLES. The peritoneum should be observed, and especially its reflection in the middle on to the posterior wall of the vagina. Between the rectum and the vagina is a large venous plexus, which is most distinct at the sides, and the mesial plane is comparatively avascular. There is no fold immediately in front of the rectum comparable to the recto-vesical septum of fascia, which is so distinct in the male. The ureter lies at some distance, and is shown in a small part of its course on the right side. The large vessels—internal pudic and sciatic—emerging through the great sacro-sciatic foramen are well seen on the left side. The bone has been divided through the fourth piece of the sacrum—a level higher than can be done with safety in surgical operations, but it is not essential to go so high up in order to obtain good access to the rectum. The figures indicate— 5. G-reat sacro-sciatic ligament. 1. Posterior wall of vagina. 2. Vaginal venous plexus. 3. Levator ani. 4. Peritoneal reflection on to posterior vaginal wall. G. Superior hemorrhoidal vessels. 7. Ureter. 8. Third sacral nerve. 9. Rectal fascia. 10. External sphincter. 11. Rectum divided.

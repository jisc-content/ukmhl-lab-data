THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and U HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. UPPER LIMB. SURFACE ANATOMY.—No. 2. SHOULDER AND SCAPULAR REGION FROM BEHIND. With this view, the dissections of the scapular region should be studied. The bony points which are of service in this region are the spine (1) and the acromion process (2) of the scapula, both of which lie at the bottom of a slight depression between the trapezius and deltoid muscles. The muscular elevations here also are of great use. The posterior border of the deltoid is distinct, passing down to the hollow on the outer aspect of the upper arm which marks the insertion of the muscle. 5 In the arm itself are found the different portions of the triceps muscle, the long head passing down from the scapula, the outer head forming a prominence to its outer side, covering over the musculo-spiral groove and its contents, while the inner head shows itself on a small area rather lower down. The deltoid here overlaps the scapular muscles and the circumflex nerve and posterior circumflex vessels, as they wind round the neck of the humerus. The figures indicate— 1. Spine of scapula. 4. Outer head of triceps muscle. 2. Acromion process. 5. Long head of triceps muscle. 3. Deltoid muscle. 6. Inner head of triceps muscle.

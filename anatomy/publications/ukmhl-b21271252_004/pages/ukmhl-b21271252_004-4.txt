THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. PELVIS. MALE PERINEUM.—No. 2. IN ADDITION TO THE PREVIOUS DISSECTION, THE ROOT OF THE PENIS HAS BEEN EXPOSED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE EJACULATOR URIN^E FROM THE SURFACE OF THE BULB, AND OF THE ERECTOR PENIS FROM THE CRUS PENIS. The cut surface of the body of the penis shows that that organ is made up of two corpora cavernosa lying side by side dorsally, and of a corpus spongiosum which contains the urethra, lying ventrally. At the root of the penis these three portions separate from one another and diverge, the corpus spongiosum being continued back into the bulb, while the corpora cavernosa become continued into the crura, which lie on the sides of the pubic arch, to which they are attached. These three struc- tures rest upon the triangular ligament. The bulb is a rather cylindrical mass of spongy tissue, which enlarges as it passes back, and is sometimes notched at its extremity. The crura are more irregular in shape, being flattened for attachment to the pubic arch and tapering away in front. They are also composed of cavernous tissue, and have a strong fibrous capsule. The transversus perinei is a small muscle, arising from the inner aspect of the ascending ramus of the ischium, and inserted into the central point of the perineum. This muscle is often pierced by the superficial perineal nerves and vessels in their course to the surface. The figures indicate :— 1. Ramus of Ischium. 6. Transversus perinei. 2. Bulb. 7. Superficial perineal nerves and vessels. 3. Erector penis (divided). 8. External sphincter of anus. 4. Crus penis. 9. Corpora cavernosa. 5. Triangular ligament. 10. Urethra in corpus spongiosum.

THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. UPPER LIMB. SCAPULAR REGION—No. 1. THE SKIN AND LAYERS OF FASCIA HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE SURFACE OF THE DELTOID, THE BACK OF THE SCAPULA, AND THE BACK OF THE ARM. The cutaneous nerves in this region are derived from some descending branches of the cervical plexus, which have been removed, and from the circumflex nerve, of which some branches wind round the posterior border of the deltoid, and some pierce the muscle, accompanied by small branches of the posterior circumflex artery. The prominence of the shoulder is formed by the deltoid muscle, which has a wide origin from the outer third of the clavicle, the acromion process and the spine of the scapula, from which the fibres converge to the insertion into the outer aspect of the shaft of the humerus about its middle. The deltoid covers the shoulder joint, and the muscles arising from the dorsal aspect of the scapula. The quadrilateral space is concealed by the deltoid, but the triangular space is seen to be a small intermuscular interval lying between the teres major and teres minor—the latter being at present indistinguishable from the infra-spinatus muscle—below the long head of the triceps. Muscles—1. Deltoid. 2. Triceps, outer head. 3. Triceps, long head. 4. Teres major. 5. Latissimus dorsi. The figures indicate— Muscles—6. Infra-spinatus, and teres minor, with fascia. 7. Trapezius. Nerves and Vessels—8 and 9. Cutaneous branches of circumflex nerve and posterior circumflex artery. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C.

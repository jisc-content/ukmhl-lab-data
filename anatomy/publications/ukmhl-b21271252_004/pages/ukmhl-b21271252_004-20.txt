THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and U HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. LUMBAR REGION.—No. 3. THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK HAVE BEEN REMOVED DOWN TO THE QUADRATUS LUMBORUM ON THE LEFT SIDE AND TO THE PSOAS ON THE RIGHT, TO SHOW THE KIDNEYS AND THE PLEURAL MEMBRANES. The left kidney is normal, the right is somewhat atrophied, and displaced downwards. The position of the kidneys from behind is as follows (see left side): In a vertical direction the kidney extends from the level of the eleventh dorsal spine to that of the lower margin of the third lumbar spine, and the outer border lies about 3f ins. from the mesial plane, and the inner border about 1 in. The upper portion is concealed from view by the last rib, by the diaphragm, and by the pleura, Lower limit of pleura. At the back the pleura is here found to pass as far down as to the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra. Frequently it is about h in. higher, i.e. between the neck of the last rib and this transverse process. It should be noted that the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra is almost at the same level as the lower margin of the spine of the last dorsal vertebra. The diaphragm has been cut away on the left side, but on the right the ligamentum arcuatum externum is seen stretching from the last rib towards the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra. Laterally, each kidney is in close relation to the colon, the right to the ascending, and the left to the descending. The figures indicate- Large numbers—corresponding dorsal and lumbar vertebrae. The small numbers— 1. Quadratus lumborum. 7. Ascending colon. 2. Psoas. 8. Descending colon. 3. Diaphragm 9. Pleura approaching spine. 4. Iliolumbar ligament. 10. Pleura in eleventh interspace. 5. Right kidney. 11. Peritoneum covering liver. 6. Left kidney. 12. Nerve, artery, and vein in intercostal space.

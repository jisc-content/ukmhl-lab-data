THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. PELVIS. FEMALE PELVIS.—No. 4. IN ADDITION TO THE PREVIOUS DISSECTION, THE URETERS HAVE BEEN DIVIDED, AND THE BLADDER REMOVED. THE ANTERIOR WALL OF THE VAGINA HAS BEEN DIVIDED AT ITS ATTACHMENT TO THE UTERINE CERVIX, AND AT THE SIDE, AND REMOVED. The vagina is about three inches long, and forms a canal which leads from the uterus to the surface. It is in the form of a transverse slit, the anterior and posterior walls being in contact, and on transverse section in some cases it appears to be H-shaped. The cervix of the uterus is, as it were, invaginated into its upper end, so that a hollow runs round the cervix, and this hollow in different regions forms the fornices. As the axis of the uterus does not correspond with that of the vagina, but is more vertical, and the anterior wall of the vagina is shorter than the posterior, the anterior fornix is very shallow, and the posterior is deep, while the lateral fornices are intermediate. The lateral aspect of the vagina in nearly its whole length is enclosed in a large mass of very highly vascular tissue, forming a large venous plexus on either side. The long axis of the vagina is almost parallel with that of the pelvic brim. The figures indicate— 1. Posterior vaginal wall. 2. Cut margin of wall. 3. Vaginal venous plexus, 4. Cervix uteri. 5. Attachment of vagina to uterus. 6. Ureters. 7. Uterine venous plexus. 8. Peritoneum.

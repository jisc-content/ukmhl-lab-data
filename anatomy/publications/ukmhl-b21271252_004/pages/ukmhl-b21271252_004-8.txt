THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. PELVIS. FEMALE PERINEUM—No. 2. IN ADDITION TO THE PREVIOUS DISSECTION, THE SUPERFICIAL LAYER OF THE TRIANGULAR LIGAMENT AND THE STRUCTURES SUPERFICIAL TO IT HAVE BEEN REMOVED, AND IN THE LEFT SIDE THE DEEP TRANS VERSUS PERINiEI MUSCLE HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY, TO SHOW THE LEVATOR ANI MUSCLE. The deep transversus perinaei arises as in the male (compressor urethne) from the inner aspect of the pubic arch, and spreads out upon the surface of the urethra in front and the vagina behind. The deep layer of the triangular ligament is formed in the same manner as in the male, and on its deep surface there is a large amount of very vascular tissue, which surrounds the upper part of the urethra and rests upon the anterior part of the levator ani, very much in the same position as the prostate in the male. The dorsal nerve of the clitoris has been left on the left side, and is similar to the dorsal nerve of the penis in the male in its course and distribution. The accompanying vessels have been removed. The figure 1. Central point of perineum. 2. Levator ani, anal fibres. 3. Levator ani, vaginal fibres. 4. Deep transversus perinsei. 5.

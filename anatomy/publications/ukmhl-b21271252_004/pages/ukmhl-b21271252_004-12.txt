IN ADDITION TO THE PREVIOUS DISSECTION, THE LOWER PART OF THE RECTUM AND THE ANAL CANAL HAVE BEEN SHELLED OUT FROM THE LEVATOR ANI MUSCLES, AND THE RECTAL FASCIA AND THE GREATER PART OF THE RECTO-VESICAL FASCIA HAVE BEEN REMOVED. The dissection now shows, below the level of the peritoneum, the back of the bladder, the vasa deferentia and seminal vesicles, and the back of the prostate, while below the prostate is a small interval between the anterior margins of the levator ani muscles which is filled in by the deep layer of the triangular ligament. External to the levator ani muscle on each side, is the apex of the ischio-rectal fossa, and it will be noticed that the seminal vesicles lie immediately above the apex of this fossa. The cut margin of the recto-vesical fascia has been left in position above, below, and at the sides, in order to show its extent and attachments. The figures indicate— 1. Rectum. • 6. Prostate. 2. Peritoneum. 7. Levator ani muscle. 3. Recto-vesical fascia investing the seminal vesicles, divided. 8. Sphincter externus. 4. Seminal vesicle. 9. Anterior margins of levator ani. 5. Vas deferens. 10.

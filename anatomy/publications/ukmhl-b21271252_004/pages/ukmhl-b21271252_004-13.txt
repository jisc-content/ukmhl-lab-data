THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY, EDINBURGH : T. C. & E, C. JACK; and 34HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.O. PELVIS. FEMALE PELVIS.—No. 1. The rectum has been exposed from behind, by removal of the superficial structures and of portions of the levator ani and coccygeus muscles, and a view has been taken to show the lower part of the sacrum and the coccyx in relation to it. The sacrum has been divided through the fourth piece. This view should be compared with the corresponding view of the male pelvis (No. 10). The principal differences between the two views arise from the much greater width between the ischial tuberosities in the female, so that there is considerably greater room for access surgically. The peritoneum on each side, where it forms the posterior wall of the pouch of Douglas, is some- what nodular, but its relation to the rectum is the same as in the male. In front it passes on to the posterior wall of the vagina. In this specimen, as in the other, the rectum is empty, and the lateral flexures are not very large, but the angle between the anal canal and the lower end of the rectum is well brought out. S and C indicate the lower part of sacrum, and the upper part of coccyx respectively. The figures indicate— 1. Eectum. 6. Superior hemorrhoidal vessels. 2. Anus. 7. Ureter. 3. Levator ani. 8. Sacral nerve. 4. Peritoneum. 9. Kectal fascia. 5. Great sacro-sciatic ligament. The sacrum has been sawn across through the fourth piece.

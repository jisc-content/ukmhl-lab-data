THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. PELVIS. FEMALE PERINEUM—No. 1. THE SUPERFICIAL STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN REMOVED, DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF THE TRIANGULAR LIGA- MENT, RUT LEAVING THE CLITORIS AND THE BULB AND CRUS CLITORIDIS ON THE BIGHT SIDE, AND THE ISCHIO-RECTAL FOSSA HAS BEEN CLEARED OUT, AND THE LEVATOR ANI EXPOSED. The orifice of the vulva is seen to be quadrilateral or lozenge shaped, and the urethral orifice lies at the anterior angle on a slight elevation, while the aperture of the vagina is a transverse slit, some- what concealed by two caruncuke. The anterior portion of the vulva has on each side the bulb, a large flattened mass of erectile tissue, wide behind but narrowing in front, while outside the posterior half of the vulva is seen a deep depression, in which lay a mass of large thin-walled veins. This venous plexus lies near the anal canal, and communicates with the inferior hemorrhoidal plexus, and is of importance in operations in this region. The crus clitoridis lies along the inner margin of the arch of the pelvis and is similar to the crus penis. The anterior layer of the triangular ligament extends across the arch of the pelvis, as in the male, but is weakened by the large aperture in the centre for the vagina, and it did not extend back to the posterior end of the vaginal orifice. The subject from which this preparation was made had been parous, and there may have been some tearing of the gynecological perineum, which has prolonged the vaginal aperture in a backward direction. Comparing this view with those of the male perineum, the clitoris and its crura are similar to the penis, while the bulb in the male is represented by the two bulbs of the vestibule. There is, as it were, a division of the bulb into two halves, and the genital and urinary tracts open on the surface between them. The ejaculator urinae muscle of the male is therefore repre- sented by the sphincter vaginas. The figures indicate— 1. Central point of perineum. 7. Triangular ligament. 2. Margin of vaginal orifice. 8. Superficial perineal vessel divided. 3. Caruncle. 9. Levator ani. 4. Meatus urinarius. 10. Clitoris. 5. Bulb of vestibule. 11. Sphincter vaginse divided. 6. Crus clitoridis.

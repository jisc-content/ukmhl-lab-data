Hence it happens that the number of the re- ticulations is smaller on the interior than on the exterior of the layer ; their size, on the contrary, being greater. The 'prisms are seen to be marked by delicate transverse striae, closely resembling those observable on the prisms of the enamel of teeth, to which this kind of shell-structure may be considered as bearing a very close resemblance, except as regards the mineralising ingredient. If a si- milar section be decalcified by dilute acid, the membranous residuum will exhibit the â– walls of the prismatic cells viewed longitudi- nally ; and these will be seen to be more or less regularly marked by the transverse striae just alluded to.

A group of three such prisms, found in a fragment of chalk, is shown in ^g. 411.: it is seen that these also exhibit transverse stria of a si- milar aspect.

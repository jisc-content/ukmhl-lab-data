Skeleton of the Paca ( Ccelogenys Paca). The Rodentia have the Jibjila situated quite behind the tibia ; in rats, voles, jerboas, the beaver, the helamys, and the rabbit, it becomes consolidated with the tibia towards the lower third of its length, a wide triangular space being left between the two bones at the upper part of the leg ; the anterior crista of the tibia in all the above genera is remarkably prominent, as is the internal edge ; and upon Fig, 266. that, viewed from behind, the tibia exhibits, in the upper half of its length, two deep fossae for the attachment of the tibialis posticus and the flexor longus pollicis. This struc- ture is more particularly remarkable in the 07idatm. In the beaver the fibula gives off from its upper extremity a strong recurrent apophysis, which is directed slightly outwards. In some genera the fibula is excessively slender, and does not reach so low down as to become connected with the lower extremity of the tibia. In those Rodents which have the fibula con- solidated with the tibia towards its tarsal ex- tremity, the tarsus seems to be articulated with the latter bone only ; but if very young Skeleton of the Jerboa (^Dipus hersipes). (^Altered from Pander and D^Alton.^ individuals are examined carefully, it is per- ceptible that the external malleolus is tbrraed by the fibula. In Rodentia the os calcis is very much elorg ted posteriorly. In such genera as have five complete toes the following circumstances may be remarked : In the beaver the os scaphoides is divided into two portions, one placed in front of the astragalus, which supports the second and third cuneiform bones, and one placed inter- nal to the astragalus, to which is attached the cuneiform bone that supports the great toe,

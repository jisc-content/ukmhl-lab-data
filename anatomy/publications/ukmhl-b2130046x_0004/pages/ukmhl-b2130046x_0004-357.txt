RESPIRATION. 341 z 3 spiration about 135; in a state of natural expiration about 118 ; and in a state of forced expiration 41 .* Goodw vn-|-, in his experiments on the capacity of the lungs upon four indi- viduals after a natural death, found the resi- dual air in the lungs to vary from 90 to 125 cubic inches, giving an average of 109, and as the chest, after a natural death, may be re- garded as in a state of natural or ordinary expiration, this result differs very little from that of Davy. Allen and PepysJ, in one experiment on the capacity of the lungs in a middle-sized man after death, also obtained a little more than 100 cubic inches of residual air. Vierordt^ supposes that the residual air in the lungs, after the deepest expiration, is about 600 cub. cent. (36-600 Eng. cub. in.), which differs but little from the estimate of Davy. Herbst || made experiments upon 11 males, between 16 and 30 years of age, with the view of ascertaining the quantity of air drawn into the lungs in forced inspiration. The smallest quantity observed was in a Jew aged 22, of small stature, and feeble muscular sys- tem. He inspired between 60 and 70 Parisian cubic inches (between 72'635 and 84*738 Eng. cub. in.) after an ordinarv expiration ; be- tween 102 and 118 (123-476 and 142-844 Eng. cub. in.) after a strong expiration ; and 120 (145-266 Eng. cub. in.) after the strong- est expiration. The largest quantity inspired was by a young man of 25 years, of middle height with a broad chest and large and powerful muscles, who inspired by a forced inspiration, about 169^ English cubic inches, without any previous voluntary expiration; about 290|- after a strong expiration; and about 290h or 295^ after the strongest ex- piration. A young man of 23 years of age, 6 feet high, with broad chest and large mus- cles, inspired, without any previous voluntary expiration, 121 English cubic inches, and 280-72 after the fullest expiration. The quan- tities of air drawn into the lungs in forced inspiration in the other eight males, were in- termediate between the highest and lowest mentioned above, and the average was about 202 English cubic inches.Herbst also sa- tisfied himself that the lungs of females have a considerably smaller capacity for air than those of males. He states that robust fe- males, about the age of 30, may inspire with- out a previous voluntary expiration, 72^ English cubic inches, after an ordinary ex- * Sir H. DavA- states that this capacity is most probably below the medium, as his chest was nar- row. t Op. cit. p. 26. J Philos.

Another boy of 13 years,'but of the size of one of 15, likewise 'expired' 116-16, while a boy of 11 years inspired withoiit a pre^-ious expiration, 36-30; after a strong expiration he inspired 72*60 English cubic inches,"aud expired the same quantity after a full inspiration. piration nearly 109, and after the strongest expiration, from about 157^ to 174^ English cubic inches.* Herbst had an opportunity, in two of these experiments on males, of ascertaining the effects of tight clothing on the extent of the respiratory movements. One individual who inspired 128 and another 116-16 English cubic inches, without a pre- vious expiration after the clothes were loos- ened, could before this only inspire 96-80 and 60.V English cubic inches, t The most extensive experiments by far, made with the view of ascertaining the quantity of air which can "be thrown out of the lungs b}' forced expiration, after the deepest inspiration, are those of Mr. Hutchinson. ^ These experi- ments were performed upon 1923 males, and they were made to breathe into an instrument constructed for the purpose, and which he has called a spirometer. He has inferred from the data he has collected on this point, the rule, that " for every inch of height (from 5 feet to 6) 8 additional cubic inches of air at 60° Fahr. ai-e given out by a forced ex- piration ;" so that he believes that from the height alone of an adult male, he can tell what quantity of air he should breathe to constitute him healthy, and that this method may be turned to important practical appli- cation in ascertaining disease of the lungs, * Bourgen* (op. cit.) states, that in well formed and healthy incli\iduals, a man at 30 ^^ill, by a forced inspiration, draw into the lungs 2-50 to 4-30 litres (or 152-567 to 262-416 English cubic inches), and a woman from 1-10 to 2-20 litres (or 67-129 to 134-259 English cubic inches), and has inferred from his experiments, that at the same age the amount of forced respiration of the male doubles that of the female, and this con- clusion accords with the results of Mr. Thackrah (The Effects of Arts, Trades, and Professions, &c., on Health and Longe^-ity, 2nd edit. p. 181, 1832), who states that " extensive examination shows us that, while healthy men exhale by the pulmometer 200 cubic inches and upwards, women rarely exceed 100, and often do not reach that amount." Mr. Thackrah supposes that this diflerence is duC; to a considerable extent, to tight lacing by females. t The condition of the stomach as to fulness, also affects the extent of the respiratory muscular movements. Mr. Hutchinson says, " I have found a dinner diminish the \-ital capacity (by which he means the greatest volimtary expiration foUoAv-ing the deepest inspiration) to the extent of 12 and even 20 cubic inches." The position of the body has also, according to Mr. Hutchinson (opus cit. p. 197), a considerable effect upon the vital capacity of the chest. In experiments upon himself he found that when standing he could throw out 260 cubic inches ; sitting, 255 ; and when recumbent (supine), 230, (prone) 220, so that position effected a difference of 40 cubic inches. In a fit of dyspnoea a person can breathe easier in the erect or sitting than in the re- cumbent postiu-e, as the dorsal movements that attend difficult respiration, are freer in the former than in the latter position.

The memoir in the last publication contains a more extensive series of experiments than that in the former. These researches would require to be still farther extended upon both sexes at the various periods of life, and imder varied circumstances, be- fore they can jield all the information on thii; subject that is desirable.

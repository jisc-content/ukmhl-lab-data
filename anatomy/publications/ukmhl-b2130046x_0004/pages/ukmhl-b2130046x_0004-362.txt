346 RESPIRATION. The results obtained by Brunner and Valen- tin, and by Vierordt, appear especially trust- worthy ; and though the number of experiments is too small to enable us to deduce averages w ith any confidence, yet we may in the meantime consider that, in an adult male of middle age, the average quantity of carbonic acid in the expired air is about 4'3o per cent.* The quan- tity of carbonic acid gas in the expired air is not uniform in the same individual, but varies repeatedly, even in the course of the twenty- four hours, and these variations are deter- mined by certain conditions of the body and of the surrounding media. Period of the day. — Dr. Prout believed that he had discovered that the quantity of car- bonic acid formed during respiration is always greater at one and the same period of the day than at any other ; that this maximum occurs between 10 a. m. and 2 p. m., or generally be- tween 11 A. M. and 1 p. 31.: and that the minimum commences about 8^ 30' p. m., and continues nearly uniform till about 3^ 30' A. M. The beginning and end of the period of minimum evolution of carbonic acid he believed to be connected with the beginning and end of twilight, and he adduces some experiments in favour of this opinion. In these experiments Prout attended only to the percentage of the carbonic acid in the expired air, and took no means to ascertain the volume of air passing through the lungs at the time,— an omission which seriouslv diminishes their value.f Prout's results do not accord with the previous experiments of Brande|, nor ments were 124 in number, and performed upon himself at abnost every hour of the day between 8 A. M. and midnight. The difference between the maximum and minimum percentage is great in Coathupe's experiments; but this was only found in single cases. § Opus cit. p. 546. These experiments were 34 in number, and performed upon three adult males between 33 and 53 years of age. II Article Respiration in "Wagners Handwbrter- buch, p. 853. Yierordt's experiments were performed upon himself, were nearly 600 in number, were ccai- tinued over a period of nearly 15 months, and were chiefly made between 9 A. m. and 7 r. 3i.

Apjohn (Dublin Hospital Reports, vol. v. 1830), and Macgregor (TransactioiLS of British Sci- entific Association for 1840, p. 87), estimate it at 3-6 and 3*5 per cent. The esrimate of Allen and Pepys (Opus cit.), and Dr. Fyfe (Dissert. Chemico- Physiol. Inaug. de Copia Acidi Carbonici e Pulmo- nibus inter respirandum evoluti. Edinburgh, 1814)^ making the average quantity 8- to 8-5 per cent., is undoubtedly considerably too high ; and they were led into this error by the impediment to the free respiration occasioned by the imperfect apparatus employed. t Thomson's Annals of Philosophy, vols. ii. and iv.

It is, however, proved by the experiments of Schariing:}: upon the human species, by Bous- singault § upon the turtle dove, and by Mar- chand j| upon frogs, that the absolute amount of carbonic acid exhaled is very considerably less during the night than during the day. Scharling gives in the following table the relative proportion of the carbon exhaled during the day and night in six individuals upon M hom he experimented : — Xight. Day. 1. Scharling 1 1-237 2.

A Gi^l - \ 1-225 The average proportion is 1 during the night to 1"237 during the day, or, in other words, nearly a fourth part more carbonic acid gas is evolved during the day than during the night.T How much of the diminished evolution of carbonic acid during the night is dependent upon the languor and drowsiness incident to that period, and how much upon the absence of the sun's rays and other causes, it is at present impossible to determine. It appears that this diminished evolution of car- bonic acid during the night does not require the occurrence of sleep, though no doubt it is increased by sleep. Digestion. — Seguin and Lavoisier **, in their experiments upon Seguin found that when he was in a stare of repose and fasting he vitiated only 1-210 cubic inches of oxygen gas in an hour, while, during digestion, this was raised to between ISOO and 1900 cubic * Opus cit. t Physiologie des Athmens, Sec, S. 66. % Aniialen der Chemie und Pharmacie, band xlv. s. 214. 1843.

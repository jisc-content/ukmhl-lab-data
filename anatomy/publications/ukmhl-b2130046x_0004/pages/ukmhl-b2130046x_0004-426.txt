The tail is used as a rudder, an oar, and a hold-fast. When styli- form, it seems used as a rudder, although in some cases apparently employed to propel the animal. When furcated it has the power of opening and closing the processes on each side, and apparently holding on to any object by their means. Many genera, as ConochUiiSy Floscularia, Stephanoceros, and others, have no fork, but remain fixed by their tails. Even in species which have forked tails, as in the Philodinaea, the creatures seem to have the power of fixing themselves independently of their fork. It would thus seem not impro- bable that the tail in these cases acts as a kind of sucker. Fig. 299. Rotifer vulgaris. (^After Ehrenherg.')

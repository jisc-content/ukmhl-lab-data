PULSE. 186 published 1796, investigated the subject more carefully, and states, that " the result of twenty-one accurate trials, made on different days and at different times of the day, all coincided to prove the greater frequency of the pulse standing, than sitting or lying." The greatest difference observed was 13 beats in a minute, and the least difference one beat. Each of these, however, occurred once only. The average difference between the above postures was about six and a third in a minute." He adds, " The pulse in health is, as far as I can find, the same in a sitting as in a horizontal posture." Dr. Knox of Edin- burgh*, however, has examined the effect of posture on the pulse still more closely than the authors just mentioned. In his first memoir, published in 1815, he says> " During the morning, the mere change of posture, from the horizontal to the erect, shall increase the pulse by about 15 or 20 beats. At mid- day this increase shall be 10 ; and in the evening 4, or 6." In his second essay, pub- lished in 1837, Dr. Knox gives the results of actual experiment. Nickf, in 1826, and Dr. Graves:}:, in 1830, also examined the subject experimentally. It is unnecessary to pursue the history of this department of the pulse into greater detail, as the fact that the pulse is greatly influenced by posture is now familiar to all medical men. The exact amount of the change due to this cause will, perhaps, be best displayed in the average results obtained by the writer from a large number of facts ob- served by himself. § The following averages were derived from observations on 100 healthy males of the mean age of 27 years, in a state of rest, unex- cited either by food or exercise, and, for the most part, between the hours of 12 and 2 p. M.: — Standing, T 8-90 ; sitting, 70-05; lying, 66'62.1| Difference between standing and sitting, 8'85 ; between sitting and lying, 3-43 ; and between standing and lying, 12*28. These are the average results, from which, however, the extremes are very widely sepa- rated ; for the difference between standing and sitting ranges from 26 to 0 ; that between sitting and lying, from 18 to 0 ; and that be- tween standing and lying, from 44 to 0. The numbers in the observation, at the highest extreme of the scale, were as follows : — Age, 20. Standing, 98 ; sitting, 72 ; lying, 54 : differences, 26, 18, and 44. To the general rule that the pulse is more frequent standing than sitting, sitting than Advancement of Science, Dublin Meeting, 1835, p. 97. * Ed. Med. and Surg.

II It is a remarkable coincidence that Dr. Harden, as the average of sc/eral experiments on his own person, obtained the same numbers, viz. 80, 70, and 66. See American Journal of Med. Science, vol. v. p. 342. lying, and, a fortiori, standing than lying, there are several exceptions. Thus there were 5 instances in which there was no difference between standing and sitting ; 19 in which there was no difference between sitting and lying ; and 2 in which the pulse had the same frequency standing and lying. Again, the pulse was more frequent sitting than standing in 3 instances ; lying than sitting in 11 instances ; lying than standing in 5 in- stances. The total number of instances, in which exceptions to the general rule occurred, was 34, or one-third of the whole. If we exclude all exceptions to the general rule, and deduce an average from the 66 ob- servations in which the pulse had what may be termed its normal character, we obtain the following numbers: — Mean age, 27; standing, 81-03; sitting, 71-12; lying, 65-62: differences, 9-91,5-50, and 15-41. The female pulse presents some pecu- liarities worthy of note, as will appear from the following average results of 50 observa- tions made under the same conditions as those just recorded : — Mean age, 27. Standing, 89-26; sitting, 81-98 ; lying, 80-24 : differences, 7-28, 1-74, and 9-02. The extreme results, in the female as in the male, are very wide of the averages ; for the difference between standing and sitting ranged from 24 to 0 ; between sitting and lying, from 11 to 0 ; and between standing and lying, from 28 to 0. The exceptions to the general rule are still more numerous in the female than in the male, the total number of exceptions being 60 per cent., and the number of observ- ations in which exceptions occurred 46 per cent. Of course the rule here referred to is the general rule established by observations on the male pulse. If, then, we compare the effect of change of posture on the male and female pulse, we discover that the effect is greater, and the exceptions to the rule less numerous, in the male than in the female. This part of the subject will repay a somewhat close examina- tion. In the following table, the numbers of the pulse, and the differences due to change of posture, are given, in round numbers, the averages being deduced from 66 observations in the male, and 27 in the female, from which all exceptions to the rule are excluded. The mean age in both sexes is 27. Standing. Sitting. L}ing. Differences.

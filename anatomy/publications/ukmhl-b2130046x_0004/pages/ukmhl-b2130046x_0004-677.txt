SKELETON. C61 u u .3 is altogether obliterated. By this circum- or post sphenoid vertebra, the cranial basis stance of the body of the sixth or occipital is contracted in its longitudinal axis, while cranial vertebra joining the body of the third the cranial vault {fig. 481.) fashioned of the expanded neural arches, affords ample space wherein to locate the crescent organ of the intellect. Prop. XL. The scapulari/ or fore-limbs of all the vertebrated animals are homologous to one another. The variety among these organs occurs by a metamorphosis or omission of ele- mentary quantity.â€” The right scapulary organ is perfectly identical with the left in the same animal body. Both the fore-limbs of the human body are identical; those of other mam- mals are identical ; those of a bird are iden- tical ; those of a reptile are identical ; and those of a fish are also identical. Os- seous quantity is equal for both fore- limbs of the same animal. But the fore- limbs of all animals are not quantitatively equal, far from it. The fore-limbs of a mam- mal differ by quantity from the fore-limbs of a bird, those of a bird from those of a reptile, and those of a reptile from those of a fish. The mammal fore-limbs manifest a quantitative difference amongst all species of that class; the avian fore-limbs the same; the reptilian fore-limbs the same ; the piscean fore-limbs the same also. The ana- tomist who would undertake the task of re- cording the quantitative difference manifested amongst all the fore-limbs of the vertebrated classes, would require a chart as free as space and a leisure as unconfined as time. As quantitative difference is of such infinite ac- count, I shall not therefore record it by the numerical method ; but my task shall rather be to develop that idea in generalisation, which will interpret the infinity of variety as

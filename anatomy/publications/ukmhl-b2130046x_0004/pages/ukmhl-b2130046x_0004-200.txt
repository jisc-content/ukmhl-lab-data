The following table presents, in septennial periods, the results ot the observations of the writer during the whole of life. Each average is founded on 25 observations, made with great care, in apparently healthy per- sons, fasting, in a state of rest, in the middle of the day, and in a sitting posture. Age. Max.

Under 2 years, 28 and 21 facts ; 2 to 5 years 27 and 23 facts: 5 to 8 years, 32 and 33 facts; 8 to 12 years, 46 and 59 facts. + This is in accordance with the observations of M. Talleix. (Op. cit.)

The sufficiency of the averages for practical purposes may also be fairly inferred from the result of a simple process of elimination adopted in the case of the female pulse. By taking 26 observa- tions, and excluding the three maxima and the three m.inima, as being possibly due to a de- parture from perfect health, an average of 20 observations was obtained, which gave the following regular series of niunbers for the twelve septennial periods of the table — 98, 94. 81, SO, 79, 78, 75, To. 77, 78, 81, 82, showing a steady and progressive decrease during the first eight periods, and an equally progressive increase during the last four periods. The difference between the male and female pulse continues to be well marked in advanced ages. Thus, in the observations of Leuret and Mitivie, the average frequency in 27 ajed men was 73, and in 34 aged women 79. The average obtained by Drs. Hourmann and Des- chambre, by observations on 235 aged females, was 82. Dr. Pennock's averages are 72 for aged males, and 78 for aged females. The general results deducible from the fore- going tables, in reference to the influence of sex on the pulse, may be thus expressed : — 1. The female pulse differs little from the male pulse during the first seven years of life; but after seven years of age the mean pulse of the female exceeds that of the male by from 6 to 14 beats ; the average excess being 9 beats.

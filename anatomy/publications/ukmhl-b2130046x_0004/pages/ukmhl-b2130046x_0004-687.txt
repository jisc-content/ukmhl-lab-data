SKELETON. 671 the crests of the iliac bones (c) are bordered with epiphyses ; and this also illustrates a similarity between them. Now, having before demonstrated the fact that the sterno-costo-vertebral quantity was a proportional of the dorso-ventral archetype, it must follow that, while a structural homo- logy exists between the scapulary or pelvic pairs and the costo-vertebral quantity, so, likewise, should the limbs themselves prove to be the proportionals of the dorso-ventral archetype; and this we shall next consider. In fig. 490. I represent the dorso-ventral ar- chetype (a), the scapulary pair of members Fig, 490. Showing the homological relation between the dorso-ventral archetype (a), the scaptilary organs (b), and the sterno-costo-vertebral quantity (c), and that the difference between these three figures is merely quantitative. (b) , and the sterno-costo-vertebral quantity (c) . What are the corresponding points and the differential characters between these three figures ? Is the difference between them one of quantity merely ? Evidently it is so, and therefore I have marked the corresponding parts of each with the same letter. In the dorso-ventral archetype (a), the laminae (4) enclose the neural space (5). In the symmetrical form, constituted of both scapulary limbs (r), the opposed scapulae (4) enclose the space (5) between them. In the sterno-costo vertebral form (c), the laminae (4) enclose the neural space (j). In A we find the ventral arches 8 (call these either haemal arches, costae, or what you will) enclosing the ventral space (9). In b the symmetrical humeri (8) enclose the space 9. In c the opposite ribs (8) enclose the space 9. In a the neural laminae (4) and the haemal laminae (8) project dorsad and ventrad from the centrum (5). In b the scapulae (4) and the humeri (8) project in the same way from the coracoid bodies (6), which I consider

That portions of the posterior roots of the spinal nerves distributed in the external cutaneous surface do act as excitors of respiration under certain circumstances, is proved by the effects of dashing cold water on the sur- face of the body, especially on the face. It is also probable that the circulation of venous blood in the arteries of the medulla oblongata may also cause the transmission of the motive influence outwards to the respiratory muscles. What are the excitations which lead to the performance of the muscular movements of expiration'? Do the same excitations that occasion the muscular movements of inspira- tion, operate in the production of the expira- tion which immediately follows, so that they are to be considered two stages of the one and the same muscular action ? These are questions which we are not prepared to answer. When the functions of the medulla oblongata are arrested, the motive influence of volition cannot pass downwards from the encephalon to the motor nerves that move the chest in respiration; and as all the ex- cited or mvoluntary movements of respiration of the same muscles must, for the reasons already stated, instantly cease, immediate death is the consequence. Destruction of a portion of the spina) chord below the medulla oblongata and above the origin of the phrenic nerve will also produce the same result, for though the excitations that lead to the per- formance of the respiratory muscular move- ments reach the medulla oblongata, the motive influence cannot pass downwards to reach the motor nerves distributed in the muscles which act on the thorax. Frequency of the respiratory muscular move- ments. — The frequency of the respirations varies in different individuals, and at different ages, and is so much influenced by the condi- tion of the body and the mind at the time, even when the individual is in perfect health, that it is a much more dif&cult matter to determine their average frequency than may at first be imagined. Quetelet* has con- structed the following table on the frequency of the respirations, at different ages, per minute, from observations made on £00 individuals. Inspiration Average. Max. Mi:i.

According to Mr. Hutchin- son §, "the prevailing numbers run as four beats of the heart to one respiration."

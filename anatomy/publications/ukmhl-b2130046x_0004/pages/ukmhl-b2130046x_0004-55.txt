As in the preceding genera these mem- branous septa support the organs of repro- duction, which are constructed after the fol- lowing manner.* The whole interior of the Actinia, between the stomach and the muscular parieties of the body, is divided by means of the septa into numerous longitudinal cavities, each of which communicates with the bases of two or three of the tentacula around the mouth "j" and encloses an ovary. Each ovary is composed of three or four cylindrical and coherent tubes of extreme delicacy, which, towards the base of the * Spix, Annaks dw Museum d'Hist.

RESPIRATION. 348 A strong infusion of tea has, according to Prout, an effect simihir to alcohol. According to Dr. Fyfe, when a person has taken mercury or nitric acid for some time, the quantity of carbonic acid is diminished. Conditions of the mind. — Prout found that anxiety and the depressing passions diminish the percentage of carbonic acid in the expired air ; and Vierordt, on two occasions, observed this effect, for a short time at least, from mental emotions, both of a joyful and of an opposite nature. Scharling remarked that in those persons who felt very anxious on being enclosed in the box used by him in his expe- riments, the evolution of carbonic acid gas from the body was much diminished. Exercise. — Prout states that moderate ex- ercise, as walking, seems always at first to increase the evolution of carbonic acid, but when continued it ceases to produce this effect, and when carried the length of fa- tigue the quantity is diminished : that violent exercise appears to lessen the quantity from the first, or if any increase occurs, this is trifling and transitory ; and that, after violent exercise, the quantity is much lessened. In Prout's mode of experimenting, the percen- tage of carbonic acid having been alone ascer- tained, we have no certain means of judging of the changes in the absolute quantity of carbonic acid evolved, as the increase in the number of respirations and in the bulk of the air respired, occasioned by exercise, was not taken into account. In the experiments of Seguin and Lavoisier already referred to, it was found that Seguin, when fasting and at rest, vitiated in the hour 1210 cubic inches of oxygen gas: by an amount of exercise equal to raising 15 lbs. to a height of 613 feet, this was increased to 3200 while still fasting, and to 4600 cubic inches, while digesting food. In Scharling's experiments, where the absolute quantity of carbonic acid gas evolved from the whole body in a given time was ascertained, the quantity of carbonic acid was increased during exercise. Vierordt ascertained that during the increased respiratory movements occasioned by moderate exercise, that on an average there w-as an increase per minute of 18*978 English cubic inches in the expired air, containing an increase of 1*197 cubic inch of carbonic acid gas, giving, however, an in- crease of carbonic acid gas in the expired air of only 0*140 per cent. There can, therefore, be no doubt that the evolution of carbonic acid gas from the lungs can be considerably increased by exercise.* Temperature. — The effects of low tempera- tures upon the respiratory process, as ascer- tained by Spallanzani and Treviranus upon snails and insects, by Marchand upon frogs, and by different observers upon the hyber- nating warm-blooded animals, are not appli- * G. R. Treviranus (Zeitschrift fiir Physiologic, vierter baud, S. 29. 1831) and Newport (opei-a cit.) in their experiments upon insects, observed a mark- ed increase in the exhalation of carbonic acid gas in these animals during active voluntar}^ move- ments. cable to the human species, since the re- duction of the temperature to a certain extent induces in these animals a lethargic condition, well known under the term hy- bernation, altogether different from its effects upon man and the other warm-blooded animals. Seguin and Lavoisier state that in their ex- periments, Seguin, in a temperature of 82° Fahr., fasting and at rest, consumed, in the space of an hour, 1210 French cubic inches of oxygen ; while in a temperature of 57° Fahr., he consumed in the same time 1344 cubic inches.* Crawford f, in experiments upon guinea-pigs, ascertained that these animals, in a given time, deteriorate a greater quantity of air in a cold than in a warm medium. The most perfect experiments on this point, at least on the human species, are those of Vierordt.J He ascertained, by numerous trials upon himself, the effects of temperature from 37°*4 to 75°*2 Fahr. From a t.ible, showing the results obtained, both upon the respiration and the pulse, at each degree of the centigrade thermometer within the limits mentioned, he has constructed the following shorter table, where the first table is arranged in two divisions,—the one containing the aver- age of all the lower, and the other the average of all the higher temperatures. In the follow- ing table the measures of the expired air and carbonic acid have been reduced to English cubic inches.

REPTILIA. — A very extensive and im- portant class of vertebrate animals, inter- mediate in their organization and general eco- nomy between fishes and the warm-blooded, air-breathing birds and quadrupeds, from both of which reptiles are distinguished by the following characters*: — Reptiles have the heart disposed in such a manner, that, on each contraction, it sends to the lungs only a portion of the blood which it has received from the various parts of the bod}^ and the rest of that fluid returns to the several parts without having under- gone the action of respiration. From this it results, that the oxygen acts on a less portion of the blood than in the mammifera. If the quantity of respiration in the latter animals, in which the whole of the blood passes through the lungs before returning to the parts, be expressed by unity, the quantity of respiration in the reptiles must be expressed by a fraction of unity. In consequence of this low^ degree of re- spiration, reptiles have cold blood, and their muscular power is less than that of quad- rupeds, and, d fortiori, than that of birds. Accordingly, they do not often perform any movements, but those of creeping and of swimming; and though many of them leap, and run fast enough on some occasions, their general habits are lazy, their digestion slow, their sensations not acute, and in cold and temperate climates they pass almost the entire winter in a state of lethargy. Their muscles preserve their irritability much longer than in the higher classes. Their heart will beat for several hours after it has been plucked out, and its loss does not hinder the body from moving for a long time. In many of them, it has been observed that the cere- bellum is remarkably small, which perfectly accords with their little propensity to motion. Reptiles are provided with a trachea and larynx, though the faculty of an audible voice is not accorded to all of them. Not pos- sessing warm blood, they have no occasion for integuments capable of retaining the heat, and they are covered with scales, or simply with a naked skin. The females have a double ovary, and two oviducts. The males of many genera have a forked or double organ of intromission. Reptiles do not sit upon their eggs ; hence the latter have generally onl}^ a membranous envelope. In many of the reptiles which lay eggs, especially in the colubri, the young one is already formed, and considerably advanced in the egg at the moment when the mother lays it; and it is the same with those species which may, at pleasure, be rendered vivipa- rous by retarding their laying. The quantity of respiration in reptiles is not^fixed, like that of mammifera and birds, * Cu\-ier, E^gne Animal, t. ii.

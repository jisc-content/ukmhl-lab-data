The coecum terminates in an elongated, conic point, which ought not to be confounded with the vermiform appendix of the ccecuro in man and in the apes. The coecum is very large, and thecolonhas also a great extension. The colon is in general larger in the Lemurince than in the SimicB. It is said by Cuvier to want cells. In Lemur murinus it is short and ample. Duver- NOY and ScHR(EDER VAN DER KoLK describe alternating constrictions and expansions in the intestinal canal of Slenojis, which, how- ever, I did not find in the three Loris 1 had the opportunity of dissecting. About the organs of voice and respiration I have, first, to mention the complete osseous disposition of the laryngeal cartilages ; se- condly, their small development ; and thirdly, the bifurcated disposition of the epiglottic. All these points are proofs of imperfection, by which may also be explained the total want of voice in Stenoj:>s. The hyoid bone is different from the hyoid bone in the monkeys, and ap- proaches to that of the inferior ManimaUa. Its body is a transverse arch, slender, and united at the two extremities with the two pairs of horns. The anterior horns aFe composed of two distinct bones, of which the first is broad and flat, the second long and slender. The thyroid or posterior horns are broad and flat, and melting away with the basis of the bone, while the anterior have a free articulation. The hyoid with its horns has the form of a transversely inclined X, viz. X.

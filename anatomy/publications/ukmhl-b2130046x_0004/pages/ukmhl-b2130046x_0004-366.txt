RESPIRATION. 350 acid evolved from the lungs to one hour, being perfectly aware of the fallacy of at- tempting to estimate from experiments so limited as to time, the quantity given off in the twenty-four hours. Scharhng conducted his experiments in a different manner. He en- closed the individuals experimented on in a box, perfectly air-tight, and so large as to permit a person to work, read, or even sleep, during the experiment. Tubes were fixed in the box, to admit the external air freely, and to conduct the expired air into an apparatus fitted for determining the amount of the car- bonic acid. The individuals experimented on remained in the box generally for an hour at a time, sometimes an hour and a half, but also often from thirty to forty minutes only ; and precautions were taken to keep up a free circulation of atmospheric air through the box during the whole of the experiment. His experiments were performed upon six persons, of different ages and of both sexes. Andral and Gavarret have drawn the fol- lowing conclusions from their experiments: 1. The quantity of carbonic acid gas ex- haled from the lungs, in a given time, varies according to the age, the sex, and the consti- tution of individuals ; and that, independently of the weight of the body. 2. At all periods of life extending from 8 years (the earliest age subjected to experiments) up to the most advanced old age, the quantity of carbonic acid evolved from the lungs differs in the two sexes, but, cceteris paribus, the male exhales a considerably larger quantity than the female. This difference is most marked between 16 and 40 years of age, during which period the male generally evolves nearly twice as much as the female. 3. In the male, the quantity of carbonic acid exhaled goes on conti- nually increasing from 8 to 30 years of age, and becomes suddenly very great at the age of puberty. After 30 years of age it begins to decrease, and this so much the more de- cidedly as the person approaches extreme old age, at which period it may be reduced to the quantity evolved at 10 years of age. 4. In the female also, the evolution of carbonic acid increases from infancy up to puberty ; but at this period, contrary to what takes place in the male, it remains stationary, so long as the menstrual secretion continues natural. At the time the menses cease, the evolution of carbonic acid gas from the lungs undergoes a marked augmentation ; but after a while it begins to decrease, as in the male, and pro- portionally as she advances towards old age. 5. In the female, during gestation, the exhala- tion of carbonic acid from the lungs equals the quantity exhaled at the period of the ces- sation of the menses. 6. In both sexes, and at all ages, the quantity of carbonic acid is so much the greater, as the constitution is stronger and the muscular force more deve- loped. The most important of the data upon which the above inferences are founded are as follows : — In the male child, in his progress upwards from his 8th to his 15th years, the quantity of carbon given off by the lungs was raised, on an average, from 5 grammes (77-165 Troy grains) to 8*7 grammes (134-267 Troy grains) per hour; while in the female at the same age it was on an average 1 gramme (15-433 Troy grains) less per hour. In the male at 16 years of age, or soon after puberty, it sud- denly increased to 157"416 Troy grains, on an average, per hour; and from this period up to the age of 20 and 25 it gradually increased, on an average, to 172*849 and 191-369 Troy grains per hour. At this {)oint it remained nearly stationary until about 40 years of age, when it began to undergo a slight diminution, but not to any great extent until 60 years of age. Adult females, who menstruated regu- larly, lost, on an average, 98*771 grains only of carbon, by the lungs, in an hour,—a quan- tity not greater than that lost by girls. Take the average loss of carbon, by the lungs, in the male at 174*392 grains between the ages of 15 and 20 years, it is, on an average, 155*873 grains between 40 and 60 years; and 141*953 grains between 60 and 80 years. In the fe- male, at the period of the cessation of the menses, the loss of carbon is suddenly ele- vated from an average of 98-771 to 129*637 grains per hour; and a similar elevation, and nearly to the same extent, was observed in four females during pregnancy. In females between 50 and 60 years of age, the loss was 112*660 grains, and between 60 and 80 it was, on an average, 104*944 grains in an hour. In one female of 82 years, it was 92*595 grains, and in a male of 102, but remarkably hale for his years, it was 91*590 grains. In a male, aged 26, and remarkable for his muscular de- velopment, the loss was as high as 217*105 grains, while in another male, aged 45, of mo- derate height, but extremely feeble muscular development, it amounted on an average only to 132*723 grains an hour.* Scharling, after allowing seven hours for sleep to an adult, and nine for a child, calculates, from his experiments on six individuals, the amount of the loss of carbon from the body as follows: — Male - Average of men Boy Girl - Aver, of cliildi-en "Woman 73 r 9 fcJD < 1 Quantity of carbon Weight exhaled in grains.

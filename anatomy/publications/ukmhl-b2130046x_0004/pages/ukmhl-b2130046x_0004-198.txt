I82 PULSE. It is true that there is no want of rough esti- mates, or of calculations founded on theoretical data ; but there is in this, as in most kindred subjects, a great lack of careful observations, and correct average results. This deficiency it is the object of this article to supply, by presenting in succession the number of the pulse, as influenced by the principal causes already specified. Age. — In treating this part of the subject no distinction is made between the sexes, nor is any notice taken of the influence of pos- ture, and time of day. The average results are based on the observations made by dif- ferent authors on healthy persons of both sexes iK a state of rest, and on those of the writer oi this article, which, with the excep- tion of \ei'y young children, were taken in the sitting posture in the middle of the day, and in a state of rest and abstinence. As these latter facts form the majority of those from which the averages are calculated, it will be correct to state that the tables pre- sent a near approximation to the frequency of the pulse in persons of different ages in a state of rest and abstinence, in the sitting posture, and at or about the middle of the day. The pulse has its maximum frequency in early infancy, and its minimum in robust old age. From infancy to adult age it continues to fall, and probably attains its lowest point at or about the age of 50, to rise again, if feeble as well as robust persons are included in our observations, in the aged. hifancy. — The frequency of the pulse is very variable at this period of hfe. According to Quetelet *, the numbers are as follow. Max. 165 ; min. 104 ; mean 135 ; range 61. Other authorities estimate it at 130 to 140, or at the last of these nS^ibers; but it will assist the memory to fix the average at 140. During the first few weeks or months of life, the frequency of the pulse in healthy children is rapidly diminished, as appears from the following Table, based on the observations of Billard, in which table the averages must be understood to be approximations. Age. Max. Min. Mean. Range. 1 to 10 daysf 1 to 2 months 2 to 3 months 180 150 100 less than 80 70 70 106 103 87 100 80 30 * Op. cit. vol. ii. p. 86. t M. Yalleix (Memoires de la Societe Medicale de Paris, vol. ii. p. 312.) gives, as the average fre- quency of the pulse in thirteen healthy infants from 2 to 21 days old, 87 beats, the maximum being 104, and the minimum 76. As these observations were made with singular care, they are entitled to much attention. Mr. Gorham (London Med. Gaz. vol. xxi.) obtained from sixteen observations on sixteen infants, less than one day old, a mean of 123 beats, a maximum.,of. 160, and a miuimimi of 100; and from forty.-'ttto'observations on infants, from one to seven days old—128 as the average, 160 as the maximum, and 96 as the minimum. The average of three experiments on childi'en asleep was 108. M. Trousseau (Journal des Connaissances Medicales et Chirui-gicales, Juillet, 1841) obtained, as the Hence, then, between the first and tenth day there is a range of 100 beats ; between the first and second months, of 80 beats ; and between the second and third months, of 30 beats, with an average fall in the first three months of about 20 beats. The numbers of observations on which these averages are founded are, between 1 and 10 days, 56 ob- servations ; between 1 and 2 months, 36 ob- servations ; and between 2 and 3 months, 20 observations.* It would answer no good purpose to enter more minutely into the fre- quency of the pulse at these early periods of life ; it will suffice to present it year by year during the first twenty-five years of life, as is done in the following table, based upon be- tween 600 and 700 observations made chiefly by the writer of this article, each average being deduced either from 20 or 25 facts.

Yalleix. Thus, the mini- mum during the first day is 104; nor does the pulse fall in any instance lower than that nimiber till the eighth week, when the least number is 90. If, again, the facts are grouped by months, the pulse is found in no case to fall below 104, except in one instance in the second month, till the eighth mouth, whea the minimum is 96. The minimum observed by M. Yalleix, occurred in a male infant, a year old, ad- mitted into the infirmary of the Hopital des Enfants Trouve's, in a state of languor, but free from disease. In a week from the date of admission the pulse had risen to 108: on the folloAving day it was 117 ; and the day after that it Avas 113. There is reason to believe, therefore, that these low frequencies of the pulse of infants occur in that state and degree of de- bihty without disease which gives rise to" an infre- quent pulse in the adult, and'that they do not occur in strong and vigorous health.

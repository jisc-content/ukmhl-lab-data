They generally swim with the convex part forwards, and with the greatest rapidity. Sometimes they simply rotate upon their axis or they tumble over and over, or, selecting a fixed point, they whirl round it in rapid cir- cles, carrying every loose particle after them. Others creep along the bottom of the watch- glass upon one end with a waddling gait; but generally, after a few hours, all motion ceases, and they are found to have attached themselves to the bottom of the glass. At the expiration of forty-eight hours the rudi- Fig. ments of a cell were observed extending be- yond the margin of the body, but at this stage the animals invariably perished, and Dr. Farre had no opportunity of witnessing their further metamorphosis.* Reproduction by ova. â€” In the genus Pedicel- Una Van Beneden discovered in most of the individuals he examined, situated immediately above the stomach, some rounded opaque cor- puscles of a lactescent appearance {Jig. 65, which seem to be attached to that viscus ; this he considers to be the ovary, containing ova in various stages of development. In the same situation he perceived an organ that he * Phn. Trans. 1837, p. 410. 65. Pedicellina Belgica. A. Section. B. A group of individuals in various states.

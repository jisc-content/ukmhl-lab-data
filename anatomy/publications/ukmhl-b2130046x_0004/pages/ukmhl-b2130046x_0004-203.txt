187 PULSE. existing between the pulses of the two sexes in this respect, it is necessary to compare equal things with equal. This is done in the following table, where the pulse in the erect posture, as deduced from 101 observations on males of the average age of 27 years, and 74 observations on females of the average age of 251 years, is in either sex 86. Standing. Sitting. Lying. Differences. Male I (77 72 9 5 14 Female j 86 {81 80 5 16 So that for the same frequency of pulse the effect of change of posture in the male is more than twice as great as in the female. The difference is still more strongly marked in early youth. The instances in which one or more ex- ceptions to general rules occurred are, as already stated, more numerous in the female than in the male, the exact proportions being 46 per cent, and 34 per cent. The next question connected with the effect of change of posture on the pulse is, whether that effect is the same at all ages '? The following table answers this question for both sexes in the negative. The averages are deduced from 30 observations at each age in the male, and 20 in the female. iding. .S &b p srences. ft MALE.

The exceptions to the general rule are also more frequent in the young subject. Another question connected with the effect of posture on the pulse requires to be exa- mined, namely, does that effect vary with the frequency of the pulse ? The following tables will be found to furnish an answer in the affirmative. The averages in the first table are founded each on 15, and in the second table on 10, observations. It will be seen that these tables concur in establishing the general rule, that the effect of change of posture increases with the frequency of the pulse; in the male as the numbers 9, 15, 27, 39 J in the female as the numbers 8, 12, 18. 50 to 70 70 to 90 bb a fcb ,c bb .5 bb .S bb c 1 '■C -i-> G -2 ■tj in i/2 j« 61 55 52 81 68 66 Differences. 6 3 9 13 2 15 90 to 110 110 to 130 bb a bb u bb c bb G bb 13 '-*-> xn m w. 101 82 74 120 93 81 Differences. 19 8 27 27 12 39 60 to 80 80 to 100 bb bb P! •-3 bb .S bb PI s J3 bb .c bb 5- a -3 m m CO m 71 67 63 92 85 80 Differences. 4 4 8 7 5 12 Differences. 100 to 120 bb bb S bb ,c Xfl 108 97 90 11 7 18 Another fact bearing on the effect of posture on the pulse, is established by the observa- tions of the writer, in confirmation of less accurate experiments previously made by Dr. Knox and others, viz. that that effect is not the same at all periods of the day. The only satisfactory way of ascertaining this fact is by contrasting the same frequency of the pulse at different periods of the day. This was done by the writer, who employed an average of twenty observations on his ow^n pulse, made before noon, twenty between 12 and 5^ p.m., and twenty between 5i p. m. and mJdnight. The greatest average difference between stand- ing and lying (10 beats) occurred before noon, the number in the afternoon being 8, and in the evening 9. The cause of the different frequency of the pulse in different postures of the body is a question of some interest, in examining which

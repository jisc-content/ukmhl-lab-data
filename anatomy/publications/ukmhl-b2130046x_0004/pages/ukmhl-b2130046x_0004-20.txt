POLYGASTRIA. 4 appendages, and with the body uniform, similar to the monads, but provided with an external en- velope or shell, and dividing by complete spon- taneous fissure beneath the common envelope into a number of animals which take the form of a polypary. At length the envelope beconies ruptured, and gives passage to the divided animals, which in their turn renew the same process of developement. Gyges. Pandorina. Gonium, (7, 8, fig. 1.) Syncrypta.

Animals dis- tinctly or most probably polygastric, without alimentary canal, and without external appen- dages; body uniform, resembling the Crypto- monadinidag in their envelope or shell, and dividing, together with their envelope, by spon- taneous, transverse fissure, into a bacilliform or fusiform polypary ; provided with moveable papillae situated in the aperture of the shell.

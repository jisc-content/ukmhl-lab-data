TOLYPIFERA. 56 thickened lining membrane of the cell. This cavity once formed, the development of the different organs proceeds rapidly. First, in the middle of the cavity there appears a longi- tudinal fold resembling two lips {fg. 62. 2), which, as they approach each other, divide the cavity of the body into an anterior and a posterior compartment. The two lips, which have a valvular appearance, become indented very regularly along their margins, and are soon recognisable as the rudiments of the tentacular circle (_/?g. 62 3). At this epoch, it must be remarked, the polype presents two cavities distinct from each other. There is a space between the ■walls of the body and the parietes of the Fig. Gl.

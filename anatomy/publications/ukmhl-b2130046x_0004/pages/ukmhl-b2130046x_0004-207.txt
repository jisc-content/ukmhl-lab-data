This law derives some confirmation from the fact that the only series of experiments on females which the writer has met with (those of Friedrich Hohl on pregnant women f) yielil averages in conformity with it; for on comparing the mean of 25 observations made * American Journal of Medical Sciences, vol. v. p. 341. •j- Die Geburtshiilfliche Exploration, bey Anton Friedrich Hohl. on the pulses of pregnant women in the morfi!»^P ing with a mean of the same number made on the same women in the evening, the pulse in the morning was 83'28, and in the evening 80 88, being a difference of 2'40. The same author also states that the pulse of the new- born infant, and of the foetus in utero are more frequent in the morning than in the even- ing.* The interval between the morning and evening is filled up by pulses of very variable frequency, where the experiments are not made with due precaution; but where, as in the second series of experiments by Nick, and in those of Knox, and of the present writer, the body remains in the same posture, in a state of rest, and unexcited by stimu- lating food, the fall in the frequency of the pulse is for the most part progressive, and free from those accelerations at noon and in the evening of which Double and Cullen have made mention. The diminished frequency of the pulse to- wards the afterpart of the day seems to de- pend altogether on the exhaustion of the strength, and is a less degree of that marked diminution of frequency which often accom- panies a convalescence from severe disease. That it is not dependent merely on the ab- sence of exertion ; in other words, that it is not the effect of continued rest, is proved by the facts now to be mentioned. It has been experimentally proved, both by Dr. Knox and by the writer of this article, that the pulse is not only less frequent in the evening than in the morning, but that it is also less excitable. So marked is the dif- ference in this respect, that in some experi- ments recorded in the Guy's Hospital Re- portsf, the very same food, which in the morning increased the frequency of the pulse from five to twelve beats, and kept it raised above its natural number from one to two hours, produced no effect whatever in the evening. This fact is in strict keeping with the well known effect of spirituous liquors in the early part of the day, as compared with their action on the system in the evening. The pulse in males appears to follow the same rule in disease as in health. The rule is inverted in females ; but in both sexes the exceptions are very numerous. J Rest. — From what has already been stated it will be inferred that the absence of exertion has the effect of diminishing the frequency of the pulse. Sleep.—The pulse falls during s'eep, slightly in adults, but considerably in young children. In six observations made by Nick on as many young adults, the mean decrease was some- what more than three beats. Quetelet, in a girl from three to four years of age, found a * An average of twenty-five observations on the morning pulse of the foetus in utero gave 138-08 beats, and on the evening pulse 135-76, a difference of 2-32 beats. Hohl himself recognizes this fact, and distinctly states that the pulse of the foetus is more frequent in the morning than in the evening. f Xo. \-iii. X Ed. Med. and Surg. Journal, No. 146.

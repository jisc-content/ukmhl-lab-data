165 PROTEIN. M 3 It is tolerably soluble in water and alcohol, but quite insoluble in ether ; and when heated to about 340° it sublimes without decomposition. When treated with nitric acid, a crystalhne nitroleticic acid is formed, consisting of H,, NO^ + NO, + HO. 2 Equivts.

The action of potash on protein and its com- pounds derives additional interest from the cir- cumstance that it may afford a clue to the man- ner in which the gelatinous tissues of the body are formed from protein compounds, a problem at present very far from being satisfactorily solved. Both protid and erythroprotid are somewhat similar in composition to chondrin and glutin ; and leucin, which Mulder considers to be actually a constituent of protein, may be obtained also from gelatine, clearly showing some connection to exist between the protein and gelatine compounds : moreover we find the gelatinous tissues formed in the herbivora, though not a trace of any analogous substance can be detected in their food. These circum- stances tend to the conclusion that the chondrin and glutin of the herbivora at least, are in some way derived from the proteinaceous matters of the food, and Mulder has suggested that it may be owing to a change produced by the free alkali of the serum, not unlike that which I have described as the effect of the action of potash on the protein compounds. Glutin con- sists, accordingto that chemist,of 3 H^^ N^ O5, and it is easy to represent by a chemical equation how such a compound maybe formed from either protid or erythroprotid. When these latter substances are formed in the labo- ratory by the decomposition of protein by potash, it is probable that two equivalents of ammonia are at the same time produced ; and we may conceive that in the living body the elements which, when not so circumstanced, unite to form ammonia, remain combined with those of protid and erythroprotid ; in that case we should have compounds containing protid ammonia, C^g Hg NO^ + NH3 = 0,^3 ^12 ^2 ^4 • and er} throprotid ammonia, C,3H,NO, + NH3 = C,3H„ O,. If now we suppose that these two hypothetical substances, C^g H^^ '^2 ^4 ^^^^ ^13 N^ O- become united, the one to three equiva- lents, and the other with one equivalent of oxygen, a supply of which is always present in the arteries, we should have in the case of protid, C,3 H,, N, O, or C,3 H,, N, O, + 2 HO ; and in that of ervthroprotid C ^ 3 H ^ ^ N, O, or C, 3 H,^ N, 6, + HO, so that in both cases glutin 7nig/it be formed. This hypo- thesis is highly ingenious and interesting, though the probability of its correctness is somewhat lessened by the circumstance that neither leu- cin, protid, nor erythroprotid, have yet been detected in the animal organism ; and more- over it is uncertain whether the alkaline re- action of the blood is owing to the presence of free alkali, or of tribasic phosphate of soda. We now come to the consideration of the natural modifications of protein, which we find composing the chief bulk of the bodies of animals, \\z. fibrin, albumen^ and casein. Fibrin. — This is a substance of the highest importance in the animal economy, since it is the material of which the solid framework of the muscles and some other tissues mainly consist ; and it is also found dissolved in the blood, from which it separates spontaneously after removal from the body, forming the clot or crassamentum. The following table shows the average proportion of fibrin in several animal products. 100 parts Fibrine.

Fibrin may be obtained from lean animal flesh by cutting it into thin sHces and washing with water till it is colourless ; it is, however, impossible to obtain it pure in this way, as it is always associated with fatty matters,"nerves,

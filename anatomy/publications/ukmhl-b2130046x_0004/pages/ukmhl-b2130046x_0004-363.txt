RESPIRATION. inches. Spallanzani* observed that snails, after a redundant repast, exhaled considerably more carbonic acid gas than when fasting. Similar observations have been made upon insects by Sorg-j- and Newport:};, upon the Mammalia by Zimmermann §, and upon the human species by Scharling ||, Valentin^, and Vierordt. The most complete experiments on this point are those of Vierordt, performed on himself, the results of which are contained in the following tables.

In Scharling's experiments the total quantity of carbonic acid exhaled from the body during a given time was determined, and they are, therefore, not liable to the en-ors of those experi- ments where the percentage only Avas ascertained. ^ Opus cit. p. 566. Valentin states that an hour after he had taken a meal of bread and butter, the quantity of carbonic acid given off by the lungs was raised from 616-085 to 627-505 English Troy grains per hour, while after a fast of 16 hours it fell to 579-972 grains per hour. ** Physiologie des Athmens, &c. S. 91 und 94. Notwithstanding, therefore, that Prout failed to observe any decided increase in the quantity of carbonic acid gas thrown off by the lungs during digestion, and that Mr. Coa- thupe maintains from his experiments that the carbonic acid in the expired air increases with increased abstinence from food, and that its maximinn quantity is before breakfast and hnmc- diately before dinner *, we must consider the evidence detailed above perfectly conclusive in proving that the quantity of carbonic acid evolved in respiration is considerably in- creased after a full meal. Fasting. — In describing the effects of di- gestion upon the quantity of carbonic acid evolved from the lungs, we were led to refer to the maimer in which the opposite condition of the body, or that of fasting, operates. That fasting diminishes the quantity of carbonic acid in the expired air is not only proved by the facts already mentioned, but also by the experiments of Scharling upon the human species, of Boussingault upon the turtle dove, and of Marchand upon frogs. The tw'O last experimenters found that in very prolonged fasting the quantity of carbonic acid was greatly diminished. Alcohol. — Dr. Prout states that alcohol, and all Hquors containing it which he had tried, have the remarkable property of diminishing the quantity of carbonic acid gas in the expired air much more than any thing else he had made the subject of experiment, and its effects were most remarkable when taken on an empty stomach. Vierordt mentions, in confirmation of Prout's observations on this point, that in four experiments, after having taken from one half to a bottle of wine, the percentage of carbonic acid had fallen, a quarter of an hour after this, from 4"54 to 4*01, and it continued to exercise this effect from one to two hours.f The quantities of atmospheric air and carbonic acid are calculated in the original tables in cubic centi- metres. In reducing these to English cubic inclicv;, one cubic centimetre has been considered tn lie ((jual to -06102523 of an English cubic inch. * London, Edinburgh, and iJublm^Philoi*. ]Magaz. vol. xiv. p. 409 and 413. The number of meals and the times at which they were taken explain the re- sults obtained by Mr. Coathupe. He lunched at 1 o'clock p. M., and at 2 p. m. the average percentage of carbonic acid gas was raised from 3-92 to 4-17, and thus so far in accordance with the experiments mentioned above. At 5^ p.m. he took a good dinner, with a pint of wine. Kow, as alcohol diminishes the quantity of carbonic acid evolved from the lungs, this might have counteracted the effects of diges- tion for a time. It must also be remembered that Mr. Coathupe ascertained only the pei'centage, not the absolute quantity of carbonic acid evolved ; and Vierordt ascertained by experiment (Physiologie des Athmens, &c. S. 93) that when he drank wine at dinner the percentage of the carbonic acid in the expired air was diminished ; and that, though its ab- solute quantity was increased, this was not nearh' to the same extent as when no "vWne was taken. Were experimenters ahvays to detail minutely the circum- stances under which they performed their experi- ments, it would frequently be found, as in the present case, that results, apparently most discord- ant, are not so in reality. t Wagner's Handw'brterbuch, band ii.

PULSE. 193 it is most probable that it was the recumbent posture; for it is in that posture that the breathing is most easily counted; and as it is possible, when the subject of the observation is lying down, to place the hand on the abdo- men, still retaining the hold upon the wrist, and to count the breathing while he remains unconscious of the object of the observer, the true number of the respirations, as compared with that of the pulse, may be ascertained with tolerable accuracy. Eighteen such ob- servations, made by the writer on as many healthy young men, gave as the average pro- portion 3-72 to 1, and thirteen observations on as many more healthy and adult females, the proportion of 3-61 to 1. The extremes, in the observations on males, were 2*54 to 1, and 5'33 to 1 ; and in females, 3*10 to ], and 4'33 to 1. In these observations the re- spiration was counted, immediately after the pulse, for two consecutive minutes. Bryan Robinson, as the result of three observations on the same number of healthy males in the sitting posture, obtained numbers of the pulse and respiration, from which the calcu- lated proportions are 3*82 to 1, 3-79 to 1, and 3-86 to 1. Quetelet*, from a series of 300 experiments on males of different ages, ob- tained the following proportions : — At birth, 3-09 to 1. 5 years of age, 3*38 to 1. 15 to 20 - - 3-72 to 1. 25 to 30 - - 4-43 to 1. 30 to 50 - - 3-88 to 1. In his own case, the average proportion was 4" 19 to 1. From a smaller number of observations on females, the following pro- portions were obtained : — At birth, 3*09 to 1. 15 to 20 years of age, 4*10 to 1. 20 to 25 - - 4-52 to 1. 30 to 50 - - 3-92 to 1. From other observations by the same author, it would appear that the proportion of the pulse to the respiration during sleep is lower than in the same persons awake, in consequence of the respiration being more affected during sleep than the pulse. Thus, in a girl from 3 to 4 years of age, the mean proportion of the pulse to the respiration was 3*40 to 1 awake, and 3*68 to 1 asleep; in a boy from 4 to 5 years old, 3-21 to 1 awake, and 3*50 to 1 asleep ; and in a female in her 27th year, 2*85 to 1 awake, and 3*19 to 1 asleep. The averages are deduced from " iin assez grand nombre d'observations" and were probably made in the recumbent posture. Drs. Hourmann and Deschambre obtained, as the result of 255 observations on aged females, 3*41 to 1, or, excluding extreme fre- quencies both in excess and defect, 3'65 to 1. Dr. Pennock, from 146 observations on aged males, obtained a mean of 3-51 to 1, and from 143 observations on aged females, 3-53 to 1. As the respiration is greatly under the control of the will, to obtain the requisite ac- curacy in observations of this nature it would be necessary to adopt some measures by which it might be counted for several minutes at least in succession, the subject of the ob- servation being either unconscious of what is going on, or having his attention diverted from it. This object the writer has accom- plished by converting the common pocket pedometer into an instrument for registering the respirations ; and by means of it, has made several hundreds of observations during pe- riods of half an hour each, the pulse being counted for one or two minutes before and after each registration of the respirations, and the average of the two or four minutes being taken to represent the frequency of the pulse during the whole period of the experiment. The greater number of the experiments were made in the sitting posture, with the back supported, the attention being diverted from the breathing by engaging in study.* The, following are the principal results obtained in this manner: — the average proportion from 238 experiments performed in the manner just described, the pulse varying from 44 to 85 beats, and the respiration from 15^^ to 20^^, was 3'47 to 1. The extreme proportions were 2*61 to 1, and 5 to 1. The average proportions varied with the number of the pulse, as shown in the following table :—• No. of Observations. False. Proportion. 8 45—50 2-75 to 1 87 50—55 3-05 to 1 50 55—60 3-31 to 1 50 60—65 3-52 to 1 50 65—70 3-59 to 1 27 70—75 3-82 to 1 12 75—80 4-18 to 1 4 80—85 4-31 to 1 * Vol. ii. p. 86. From the results of these experiments, then, it would appear that the proportion which the pulse bears to the respiration, in the same posture of the body, diminishes as the frequency of the pulse increases. Another fact established by these experi- ments is the different frequency of the respira- tion morning and evening for the same fre- quency of pulse. Thus, for a pulse of 63, being an average of 50 experiments in the morning and 50 in the evening, the number of respirations in the morning was 17*60, and in the evening 18'58, being as nearly as pos- sible as the numbers 17 and 18. The effect of posture on the respiration, and the proportion which it bears to the pulse, is, however, still more remarkable than that of the time of the day. Thus, to take the only instance in which it was possible to compare the proportion of the pulse to the * An abstract of the results of these experiments was first pviblished in the first part of Hooper's Phy- sician's Vade Mecum, edited by the writer early in the year 1842.

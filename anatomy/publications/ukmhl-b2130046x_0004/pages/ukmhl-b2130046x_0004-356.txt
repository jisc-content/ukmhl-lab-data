340 RESPIRATION. fifty males and twenty females*, with the view of ascertaining the relation between the inti- mate anatomical structure of the lungs, and the functional capacity of these organs in the 'two sexes, concludes that the volume of air required by an individual in ordinary respira- tion augments gradually with the age, being least in youth (from 5 to 15 years), in conse- quence of the extreme vascularity of the lungs ; increased from 15 to 30 years of age, in consequence of the proportional diminution in the closeness of the pulmonary capillary network of blood vessels; and to a much greater amount in old age, in consequence of the more rapid diminution of the extent of the respiratory membrane, which begins to take place after the lungs have arrived at their full development, or the age of 30. It is obvious that we are not yet in posses- sion of data to enable us to venture upon an estimate of the average quantity of air in- spired and expired at an ordinary respiration, when the body is at rest and the mind undis- turbed, at different periods of hfe, in the two sexes, and in different physical configurations of body. It is equally apparent that this is liable to considerable variation, and that the different results obtained by most experi- menters,— setting aside those where an obvi- ously faulty method was pursued, — depends as much upon the inherent differences in the extent of the respiratory movements in the individuals experimented upon, as upon errors in the mode of experimenting, and that the chief error committed by some of them consists in deducing averages from the few and insufficient experiments performed by themselves, and casting doubts upon the results obtained by others, simply because di%iduals, and are therefore of little value in enabling us to ascertain the average quantity of air taken into the lungs and again expelled in ordinary respiration. Besides, some of these experiments are liable to ob\'ious objections. Borelli (De Motu Animalium, Pars Secunda, p. 118. Lugdani, 1685) who appears to have been the first who attempted to ascertain this by experiment, estimates it at 15 cubic inches. Turin (Diss. p. 41, 42, as quoted by Haller), fi-om experiments on his own person, at 40 cubic inches; and this is the estimate also formed by Menzies (op. cit. p. 28,) from his experiments. GoodwA'n (The Connexion of Life "\\ith Respiration, &c., p. 36. 1788), from experiments on three individuals, esti- mates the quantity inspired at 12 cubic inches, which he supposes to be increased to 14 in the lungs by the increase of temperature. Sir H. Daw (Researches Chemical and Philosophical, &c., p\ 4.33, 1800) informs us that he threw out of his lungs at each ordinary inspiration nearly 13 cubic inches; ]Mr, Abernethy (Surgical and Physiological Essays, Part II. p. 142', 1793), that he inspired 12 cubic inches; Dalton (Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophi- cal Society of Manchester, 2nd Series, vol. ii. p. 26), also from experiments on his own person, esti- mates an ordinary inspiration at 30 cubic inches; Allen and Pepys' (London Phil. Trans, for 1808), from experiments on one individual, at 16^ cubic inches; and Thomson (Animal Chemistry, p. 612. 1843) estimates his own inspirations at 16 cubic inches. * Archiv. General, de Med. 4^ Serie, torn. i. p. 875, 1843, and Comptes Rendus, 23 Janvier, p. 182. 1843. they do not accord with their own. It also necessarily follows that we are not in a posi- tion to form an estimate of the average quan- tity of air which passes out and in from the lungs in twenty-four hours in ordinary respi- ration. Vierordt*, from experiments on his own person, calculates that he respires 603-t cub. cent. (368'074' English c. inches) of atmospheric air in one minute, or 8,688,960 cub. cent. (o30,026'560 Eng. c. in.) in the twenty-four hours. As, however, the respi- ration is rendered more energetic by speaking, walking, &c., any estimate drawn, as this by Vierordt is, from observations made when the body was in a state of rest, will be, as he was aware, too low ; and proceeding on some of the results of Scharling's experiments, he makes allowances for this increase, and esti- mates the quantity of air respired in the twen«:y-four hours at 624,087'401 Enghsh cubic inches. Valentin-j- calculates that in his own person, after making allowances for temperature and watery vapour, he respires 469'97o5 litres (28681 1948 English cubic inches) in an hour, and 688,348-6761 Eng. cubic inches, or nearly 398.| cubic feet of atmospheric air in the twenty-four hours.J The quantity of air drawn into the lungs during quickened or forced inspiration, and again expelled during expiration, also varies very considerably in different individuals of the same age. Sir H. Davy§, in many ex- periments upon himself, ascertained that at a temperature from 58° to 62° Fahr. he threw out of his lungs by a full forced expiration, Cubic Inches. After a full voluntary inspiration, from 189 to 191 After a natural inspiration, from 78 — 79 After a natural expiration, from 67 — 68 So that, making corrections for temperature, he calculates that his lungs, in a state of vo- luntary or forced inspiration, contained about 254 cubic inches ; in a state of natural in- * Op. cit. pp. 856, 857. t Op. cit. p. 570. The effects of exercise, diges- tion, &c., are included in this estimate. X Mr. Coathupe (London and Edinburgh Phil. Magaz. vol. xiv. p. 401, 1839), from experiments on his ovn\ person in a state of rest, estimates the number of respirations at 20 in the minute, the average bulk of each respiration at 16 cubic inches, and the quantity of air that passes through the lungs in 24 hours', at 460,800 cubic inches, or 266-66 cubic feet. Mr. Coathupe's estimate agrees pretty closely ■^^^th that of Dumas (Statique Chimique des Etres' Organises, 3" edit. p. 87), also formed from experiments on his ovra. person, in a state of rest. The estimate of the quantity of air that passes through the lungs, given by Bostock (System of Physiology, p. 321, 1836) is "in all probability above the" average. He proceeds on the supposition that in ordinary respii-ation a man respires 40 cubic inches of a'ir 20 times in a minute, so that he makes the quantity respired in the 24 hours, 1,152,000 cubic inches or about 666^ cubic feet. It is probable that between 25 and 30 cubic inches of air for each ordi- nary inspiration will be found to be near the average in an adult male when in a state of rest. § Researches Chemical and Philosophical, &c., p. 410. 1800.

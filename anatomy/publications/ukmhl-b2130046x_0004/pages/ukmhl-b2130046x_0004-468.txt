The tubes of one lobule are distinct from those of the neighbouring lobuli, or only communicate indirectly by means of the trunks or hepatic ducts, originating from the tubes, and lying in the interspaces of the lobuh. The secreting cells (fig. 320.) are irre- gularly angular or polygonal in form, from mutual pressure, and line the interior surface of the tubes. They vary in size in a moderate degree in different animals, and also in the same animal, appearing to depend upon cer- tain conditions of the animal and liver."* We have ourselves verified these important observations to a certain point, not having been able to obtain a view of the regular and complete plexus of ducts figured and described by Dr.Leidy,but having satisfied ourselves that a system of canals, prolonged from the bile- ducts, exists in each lobule. The recently published observations of Dr.Natalis Guillotf are to the same effect. He has not been able, any more than ourselves, to distinguish mem- branous parietes around these canals ; and he considers that they are simply channelled out in the parenchyma of the liver, the particles of which form its sole borders. It appears probable to us, however, that these canals correspond to the spaces left in the centre of the biliary tubuli of insects, &c.; and that the membranous walls, if they exist at all, would be found to invest the cells which immediately bound these passages. The biliary cells of the Mammalia (fig. 520.) usually contain a certain number of adipose particles; their size and number, however, vary considerably according to the food of the animal, the amount of exercise which it has been taking, and other circumstances. If an animal be very fat or well fed, especi- Fig. 320. Hepatic cells of human Liver. a, three secreting cells of ordinary aspect; b, a secreting cell much more highly magnified, show- ing the central nucleus, granular particles, and oil globules ; c, four secreting cells from a human liver in a state of fatty degeneration, showing a great increase of oil globules. (After Leidy.) ally with farinaceous or oleaginous substances, the proportion of adipose particles is much greater than in an animal moderately fed and taking much exercise. The size of the glo- bules varies from that of mere points, scarcely distinguishable from the granular contents of the cells but by their intense blackness, up to one-fourth of the diameter of the cell. The finely granular matter is the portion from which the colour of the cell is derived ; it seems to fill the space not occupied by the oil globules ; and it often obscures the nu- cleus, so that the latter cannot be distinguished until acetic acid is added, which makes the granular matter more transparent without affecting the nucleus.

The human cranio-facial and ceTvico-hyoid apparatus. Shelving tliat the liyoid apparatus relates to the cervical vertebrae, aud the facial apparatus to the cranial vertebra;, just as the thoracic or costo-stemal apparatus relates to the dorsal vertebra;. (f P*)' that hiatus or gap in costal series which is called the cervix, and it is this hiatus * In the " Homologies," the author names the maxillae the "inverted arches" of the cranial ver- tebrae. These inverted arches answer to the haema- pophyses of the author's ideal typical vertebra, and not to the pleurapophysial elements (the ribsj of that ideal foiiii. Now I confess, for my own part, that I do not see clearly why these maxillary arches are referred to the former rather than to the latter elements. There is e^^dently some mystery about this ideal typical vertebra tigured in the " Homo- logies," which I cannot penetrate, and for this reason, viz. that I find the author's " ideal tj-pical {q q q) which interrupts the idea of a con- tinuous serial costal order ; at the same time vertebra," while compared to the osseous segment taken from the bird's thorax, and which he terms the " natural typical vertebra," does not con-espond quantitatively. In this ideal form I tind the ribs (pleurapophyses) but as niere rudiments, whilst in the natural form I see that these ribs emljrace tho- racic space from the spine nearly to the sternum. Again, in the ideal form the hasmapophyses hang appended to the vertebral centrimi; Avhereas in the natural tji^ical form they articulate %vith the distal ends of the thoracic ribs.

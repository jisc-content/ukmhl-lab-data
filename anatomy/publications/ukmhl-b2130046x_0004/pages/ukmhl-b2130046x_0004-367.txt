351 RESPIRATION. In these experiments of Scharling the evo- lution of carbonic acid by the skin was in- cluded, with that evolved through the mouth and nostrils ; and the quantity is calculated for the twenty-four hours. But in some sub- sequent experiments, by uniting the use of the mask used by Andral and Gavarret with the box, he has been enabled to ascertain the relative amount of the loss by these two dif- ferent channels in an hour. In other respects, he has endeavoured to assimilate his experi- ments, in regard to the hour of the day, &c., to those of Andral and Gavarret, and has given the following comparative view of the results : — 1. Male aged 28 years 2. — — 16 — 3. Boy — 9| — 4. Young Woman 19 — 5. Girl - - 10 — Total quantity of carl)on from the Avhole body in Troy grains. Carbon from general sur- face of body. Carbon expired through the mouth and nostrils in Troy grains. >Scharling.

Vierordt endeavours to point out that the diminution in the per- centage of the carbonic acid gas in the ex- six experiments on themselves, calculate that 172-664 Troy grains of carbon were thrown off from the lungs in an hour. t This table is given in the form into which it has been thrown by Hannover (De Quantitate relativa et absoluta Acidi Carbonici ab homine sano et jegroto exhalati, p. 17. 1845) and the kilo- grammes and grammes in the original table have been reduced to Troy pounds and Troy grains. * As the boy upon whom Scharling experimented was of slender form, he has taken the average of the results of Andral and Gavarret upon two boys of 10 and 8 years as the standard of comparison in tliis case. t Wohler and Liebig's Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, band Ivii.

The operation of this law, according to Vierordt, may be illustrated as follows. Let us take the average number of respirations in a state of rest as 12, and suppose these to be doubled or increased to 24, the relative percentage of carbonic acid will be dimi- nished by 0*8 ; if the number of respirations be again doubled, or increased to 48, the carbonic acid will suffer a still further dimi- nution of 0*4 per cent. ; and if the respira- tion be again doubled, and increased to 96 per minute, the carbonic acid will suffer a farther reduction of 0 2 per cent. On the other hand, if the number of respirations be less than 12 (here taken as the normal number of respirations by Vierordt) by one half or reduced to 6 in the minute, the re- lative percentage of carbonic acid will be in- creased above what it is in the normal fre- quency by 1*6. If the percentage of carbonic acid in the expired air be 4*1, when the re- spirations are 12 in the minute, it will be 5"7 per cent, when the respirations are 6, and 2'7 per cent, when they are 96 in the minute. Proceeding upon the existence of this law, he supposes that if the respirations were increased from 96 to twice that number, or 192, the percentage of the expired air would suffer a farther reduction of only O'l per cent.; in other words, it would be reduced from 2'7 to 2*6 per cent. This last ratio, viz. 2 6, he believes to be the smallest percentage of carbonic acid gas that the expired air can present. If Vierordt be correct in supposing that the percentage of carbonic acid in the expired air has a fixed arithmetical proportion to the frequency or length of the respiratory movements, we could, after determining the normal number of respirations, the bulk of air expired, and the percentage of carbonic acid

343 RESPIRATIOX. under circumstances where the ordinary me- thods fail. Mr. Hutchinson has given the following table to show the quantity of air expelled by the strongest expiration after the deepest inspiration for every inch of height between 5 and 6 feet, as ascertained by actual experiment (column 1) by his spirometer, and as calculated according to the rule mentioned above (column 2).

He states that weight doe^ not atFect the respira- tory power of an individual of any height between 5 feet 1 inch and o feet 11 inches until it has increased 7 per cent, above the average weight of the body in persons of that height, but beyond this it diminishes in the relation of 1 cubic inch per pound for the next .35 pounds—the limit of the calculation. In males of the same height the respiratory power is increased from 15 up to 35 \ears of age, but from So to 65 years it decreases nearly li cubic inch for each year.f Bourgery * Med.-Chir. Trans, vol. xxix. p. 237. Experi- ments to ascertain the quantity of air that may be inspired or expired in forced respiration have also been perfonned by Hales (Statical Essays, vol. i. p. 243), Jiirin, Menzies, Goodw%-n, Dr. Bostock (Sys- tem of Physiology, p. 316. 183*6), Dalton (Opus cit, p. 26), Thomson (Animal Chemistry-, p. 610. 1843), Valentin (Opus cit. p. 540), and Thackrah (The Effects of Arts, Trades, and Professions, &c. on Health and LongeAity, 2nd edit. pp. 27, 30, 64, 76, 98,181, and 182). These experunents, however, are neither sufficiently numerous— several of them hav- ing been performed on a single indi%'idual only,— nor are they accompanied "with the details necessary to enable us to contrast them with those of Mr. Hutchinson; but the results obtained in the greater number of these do not differ much from those of IMr. Hutchinson Ujion men of middle stature. Va- lentin experimented on six males, and his estimates rest on the questionable supposition that the ex- pired air is fiilly satiu-ated vrith moisture. Thom- son experimented on 11 males and 1 female, from 14 to 33 years of age: and ]\Ir. Thackrah's experi- ments were considerably more extensive, and were made on individuals of different trades and pro- fessions. t Mr. Hutchinson has not observed any direct relation between the circumference of the chest and the respiratory power or Avhat he terms the vital capacity. According to the experiments of Herbst concludes from his experiments already re- ferred to, that the measure of respiration (by which he apparently means the quantity of air which may be drawn into the lungs by a forced inspiration) is greater the younger and thinner the person is ; that its maximum in both sexes occurs at the age of 30; that the relation of a forced and ordinary res[)iration diminishes with the age of the individual, being, he says, from 1 to 12 at three years of age, as I to 10 at fifteen, as I to 9 at'twenty, as 1 to 3 at sixty, and as 1 to ^ or -i- at eighty years; whence it follows that in youth there is an immense respiratory power in reserve for any violent exertion, while in old age the individual under such circumstances is at once out of breath.* Changes upon the atmospheric air in respi- ration.— One of the most obvious changes, under ordinary circumstances, upon the air that enters the lungs in respiration is an increase of its temperature, and consequently an augmentation of its bulk. As a quantity of water is readily supplied by the fluid secre- tions of the inner surface of the air-passases, and by the blood in the pulmonary capillary blood-vessels, this augmentation of the tem- perature of the air is also necessarily attended by an increase of its watery vapour, and con- sequently by an additional increase in its bulk and elasticity. The expired air, therefore, contains more caloric, more watery vapour, is more elastic, and is of less specific gra%-ity than the inspired air. Valentin performed 12 experiments on his own person by breathing through an apparatus invented by Brunner and himself, to ascertain the temperature of the expired air, and he obtained the following results. In breathing atmospheric air of a temperature varying from 8°-o to 33°'o Reau- mur (51°-12o to lO^T'^-ST.S Fah.), he observed a difference of l°-7o R. (3=-937 F.) in the temperature of the expired air, M'hile breath- ing in the lowest temperature, \\z. 51^'] 25 F., the temperature of the expired air was 96°* 687 F., and was warmer than the inspired air by 45°•562 F. ; and when breathing in the highest temperatm'e the expired was colder (Opus cit. p. 104), and Mr. Hutchinson, the mode of determining the quantity of air which the lungs are capable of containing during life in any parti- cidar case, by measuring after death the quantity of air which can be thro^^^l into them by inflation, is fallacious. This is probably chiefly due to the congestion of the depending parts of the hmgs by blood, so fi-equently foimd after death. Both Herbst and Mr. Hutchinson have performed experiments to show the extent to which the quantity of air in forced respiration is diminished in phthisis. * Among the proofs of these conclusions, ad- vanced by Bourgery, it is stated by him that the measure of respiration of a boy of 15 years of age is 2 litres (122-054 Eng. cubic inches), and a man of 80 years 1-35 litre (82'386 Eng. cubic inches) : that while a boy of 10 years and a man of 80 inspire by a forced inspiration the same quantity of air, viz. 1-35 Litre, yet the ordinary respiration of the former is only 1 decilitre (6402 Eng. cub. in.), while that of the latter is 9 decilitres (54-918 Eng. cub. in.); so that ynxh. a mass three times smaller, the child possesses an energy of hematose eight times greater.

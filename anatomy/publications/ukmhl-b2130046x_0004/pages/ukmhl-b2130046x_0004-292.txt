From these insertions it cannot but be regarded as the serratus antic us (costo coracoidien) (^/?g. 191. ,57). 2d. The elevator of the scapula is inserted at the middle internal portion of the scapula, and derives its origin by seven fleshy slips from the transverse apophyses of the seven last vertebras of the neck. 3d. Another small elongated muscle is at- tached beneath the carapax, near the sternal extremity of the first rib, and is inserted upon the dorsal extremity of the first bone of the shoulder: this is probably all that remains of the serratus magnus, for it must not be forgotten that here the muscles, as well as the bones, are in an inverse position. The above description is taken from the turtle; in the land-tortoises the second muscle is very strong, and occupies all the length of the border of the scapula. Bojanus considers it as representing the Scalenus. 4th. There is a thin muscle met with in the fresh-water tortoises, of which Bojanus makes no mention ; this is inserted upon the anterior margin of the acromion; it runs along the side of the neck, but without any attachment to the bones; it is lost in the general aponeurosis. If this be not regarded as a platysma, it can only represent the tra- pezius. In the emydes, vestiges of a dorsal cutaneous muscle are inserted into the apo- neurosis of the subscapularis. Muscles of the Ann. â€” In order to under- stand the arrangement of the muscles of the shoulder and arm in the Chelonian reptiles, it is necessary to bear in mind that their scapula is styliforra, that the acromion and the coracoid are singularly elongated, and that the entire scapula with the humerus are

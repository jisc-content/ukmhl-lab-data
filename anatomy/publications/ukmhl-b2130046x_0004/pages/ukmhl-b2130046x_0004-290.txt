So far, even as regards the small mus- cles of the neck, the analogies are suffi- ciently satisfactory; but it is not so with the long muscles coming from the dorsal or lumbar portion of the spine, which are re- placed by others having a totally contrary Fig. 191.

Of these, in the land tortoises, and in the fresh-water tortoises, the principal is a thin lamina attached within the carapax to the ribs of the fifth arid sixth dorsal vertebrae, and running together with its fellow of the opposite side obliquely forwards, and in the interval between the two lungs, on to the sides of the anterior or horizontal portion of the neck, where it is inserted by fascicuU to the transverse apophyses of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebrae : it terminates by a long fasciculus, which is inserted beneath the head to the basilar bone. This muscle draws the neck and head backwards, and to one side ; this is the retrahens capitis of Bojanus. A little more forward, and beneath the articulation of the fourth and fifth dorsal vertebrie, there is a similar muscle, which might indeed be regarded as a portion of the preceding, and which goes to be inserted into the side of the sixth cervical vertebra: this

A consideratioe of the large quantity of atmospheric air pass- ing through the lungs in the 24 hours, and the extent to which it is vitiated by this in the removal of a part of its oxygen and the sub- stitution of a quantity of carbonic acid gas, will assist us in acquiring definite information regarding the amount of ventilation required in the apartments of our private and public buildings. It appears that between 400 and 500 cubic feet of atmospheric air pass daily through the lungs of an adult enjoying mode- rate exercise; and the estimate of Dalton, that 23 cubic feet of oxygen gas are, during the same period, aborbed at the lungs, is pro- bably not far from the average. The same air cannot be breathed twice without in- ducing prejudicial effects, so that at each in- spiration entirely fresh air ought to be sup- plied, or the air ah'eady breathed ought to be so largely diluted by the admission of fresh air as to be restored very nearly to its original composition. Leblanc informs us, that in the Chamber of Deputies in Paris, where the system of ventilation is based upon the prin- ciple of furnishing to each individual from 10 to 20 metres cubes (353-316 to 706-331 English cubic feet) of air per hour, the air issuing from the apartment contained from 2 to 4 of carbonic acid gas in the 1000 parts by weight.* The quantity of pure atmospheric air here furnished is probably somewhat insuf- ficient, if the presence of 1 part of carbonic acid in the 100 of atmospheric air be likely to act prejudicially when breathed for a long time * Annales de Chimie et de Physique, troisieme se'rie, tom. v. p. 241. 1842. In the Model Prison at Pentonville from 30 to 45 cubic feet per minute, or from 1800 to 2700 cubic feet per hour, of pure fresh air is made to pass into every cell. (Report of the Surveyor-General on the Construction, &c. of Pen- tonville Prison. 1844.) continuously. From Dr. Snow's experiments, it appears that the prejudicial effects of breath- ing air deteriorated by respiration, is not en- tirely due to the presence of an increased quantity of carbonic acid gas, but also in a considerable degree to the diminution of the oxygen. He found that birds and mammalia introduced into an atmosphere containing only from 16 to lOi per cent, of oxygen soon died, though means were adopted for remov- ing the carbonic acid formed by respiration.* The increase of the carbonic acid gas to 12 and 20 per cent., provided the oxygen gas was still as high as 21 per cent., did not appear to enfeeble the vital actions more rapidly than the diminution of the oxygen to the extent above stated. Any notable diminution in the percentage of the oxygen gas, even when no carbonic acid is present, cannot take place without danger to the warm-blooded ani- mals-{-, and the carbonic acid in the air respired acts more or less energetically in destroying life, as it has been produced at the expense of the oxygen of the air, or been added to it already formed .J * Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, vol. Ixv. 1846. A green-linnet was confined in a vessel containing 2000 cubic inches of air, consisting of 16 of oxygen and 84 of nitrogen in the 100 parts by volume, and it died in ten minutes. A mouse was introduced into the same vessel filled with air con- taining 10 J per cent, of oxygen, and in five minutes it was no longer able to stand. f There is a marked difference in this respect be- tAveen the cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals. Vauquelin (Annales de Chimie, tom. xii. p. 271.1792) in his experiments upon some snails, found that when confined in a quantity of air, all the oxygen had disappeared at the time of their death; and Spallanzani observed the same thing in a few of his experiments on the same animals. Matteucci (Le- mons sur les Phenomenes Physiques des Corps Yi- vants, p. 115. 1847), obtained similar results on a torpedo confined in a limited quantity of water.

POLYPIFERA. 21 c 3 fluid; and, to an ordinary observer, no fibres of any kind are distinguishable in any part oi Fig. 25. HydrcB virides in different 'stages of extension and contraction, reproducing gemmiparoiisly, attached to the roots of duck-weed, (^From Roesel.) its body : nevertheless it is highly contractile, shrinking, when disturbed, into an almost in- visible jelly-like speck, and again slowly ex- panding itself when left quiet. Incapable as such a creature would appear to be of any active exertion, this little gelatinous bag is soon found to be gifted with a capability of locomotion, which is exercised in the fol- lowing manner: whilst attached to the side of the glass by the sucker at its closed extre- mity, which forms a minute foot, something like that of a Gasteropod Mollusk, the Httle polype gradually inflects its body until some of the tentacula around its mouth are brought in contact with the supporting surface, of which they take a firm hold; in this position it detaches its posterior sucker, and, advanc- ing it towards its head, again fixes it, and thus progresses, after the manner of a leech, by a repetition of the same manceuvres. It may, however, be easily imagined that, owing to the minute size of the Hydra, and the ex- treme slowness of its contraction, this mode of progression is by no means remarkable for its speed, and in fact a march of an inch will occupy it many hours in its performance ; accordingly the polype has been endowed with another mode of transit, of which it can avail itself at pleasure. Although its body is spe- cifically heavier than water, so that when de- tached from its hold it sinks helplessly to the bottom, it is able, when occasion requires, to row itself about in a very ingenious manner. In order to accomplish this feat, it first creeps to the top of the water, and protruding its sucker to a little distance above the surface, hollows it out into a saucer-like cavity, the buoyancy of which is sufficient to keep it afloat; and then, supported by this curiously- contrived boat, the little Hydra rows itself about by means of its tentacula in whatever direction it chooses. No traces of nervous matter are perceptible in the composition of the Hydra, which, in its whole structure, is completely acrite ; nevertheless it is evidently able to appreciate the presence or absence of light ; for if a number of these little animals are confined in a glass vessel, one side of which is exposed to light while the other is kept in the shade, they are always found to congregate on the illuminated side, and by turning the glass round it will be found that by changing their position, they will endea- vour to regain a situation exposed to the solar influences: seeing, therefore, that they are absolutely destitute of eyes, it would seem that they perceive light by the sense of touch alone. It might naturally be supposed that a crea- ture so low in the scale of organization would be compelled to subsist upon the simplest pos- sible aliment, yet, strange to say, this little polype is carnivorous in its propensities, and is moreover gifted with such terrible powers of destruction, that animals far larger, stronger, and more active than itself fall a prey to its voracity : the Entomostracous Crustaceans, the larvae of insects, and minute Annelidans, constitute its ordinary diet, and vainly endea- vour to escape from its clutches. Whilst watching for prey, the Hydra remains per- fectly at rest, suspended by its tail, and keep- ing its oral tentacula widely spread out in difl^erent directions, nor has it generally to wait long before some of the multitudinous animals that crowd the water in its vicinity impinge against its outspread lines, when im- mediately, as if the wand of an enchanter had been laid upon it, the career of its victim is arrested; though apparently only touched, not seized, it immediately sinks motionless as though paralysed by the contact, and only after some time recovers its former vivacitv. What is the benumbing power possessed by the tentacula of the Hydra it is difficult to conjecture; some writers attribute it to a tor- pifying secretion ; others surmise the dis- charge of an electric shock ; but whatever be its nature, its effects are sufficiently potent to prevent the escape of the animal subjected to its influences. No sooner is the prey thus stricken motion- less than the tentacle against which it im- pinged begins slowly to contract and drag it towards the orifice of the mouth. It would seem that the slightest eflfbrt on the part of the animal seized would be sufficient to tear off" the almost invisible gelatinous arm of the polype, yet not more surely does the angler land a trout by means of his silken line, than the Hydra succeeds by its tenacious hold in secLU-ing its victim ; tentacle after tentacle is brought to bear upon it, and slowly it is ap- proximated to the opening of the stomach of the polype in w hich it is about to be engulphed. When lodged in thp stomach of its de- vourer, so thin and diaphanous is the distended bag of the Hydra's body, that the animal swal- lowed is still distinctly visible, and the micro- scopical observer would scarcely suspect that the pellucid film which covers it was capable of producing much effect upon its substance. Gradually, however, the swallowed prey begins

19 Medical Journal,' July 8th, 1893) and has shown that this John Hunter is not the Burgeon. The heading in the Glasgow book runs thus: " Nomina diBcipuloruni Olassis quintas qui hoc anno Acaderniaui intrarunt." This fifth Class is " Latin," and not " Nat. Phil." as stated by Mr. Holden. The Hunter entry is " Joannes Hunter filius Joannis Hunter (natu secundus) Mercatoris quondam Glasguensis "; in the same year there appears the Matriculation of " Jacobus Hunter filius Joannis Hunter quondam Mercatoris Glasguensis, Natu maximus." There can be little doubt but that these two, James and John Hunter, were brothers and it is known that James the brother of the Surgeon died before this date. In the matriculation entry of William Hunter in 1731, of which there is also a photograph, he is described as " Gulielmus Hunter: F. Johan. Hunter inter Dominos de Long Oalderwood." The writing of " John Hunter " in the Glasgow book is very different from that of " John Hunter " in the Oxford Matriculation book. The latter is undoubtedly in the John Hunter's own writing.

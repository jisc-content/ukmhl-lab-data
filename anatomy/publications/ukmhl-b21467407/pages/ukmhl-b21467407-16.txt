The following extract from Sir Jaines Paget's Hunlerian Oration, p. 39, refers to the two preceding Catalogues :— " I am indebted to Messrs. Christie and Manson for the opportunity of reading the sale-catalogue of Hunter's collections and library. About 120 pictures were sold for ,£800. They were chiefly by old masters, including some of the best; and there were so\eral by Hunter's chief contemporaries, Hogarth, Reynolds, Loutherbourg, Zofl'any, and Zuccarelli. Among them, also, were some medical portraits, including one of Harvey, by Janssen. 'lhe engravings, including a large collection of Hogarth's, sold lor about £140; the ' curiosities' fetched about £200 ; and the books, including, I think, nothing significant, about £100. The proceeds of the four days' side, in January and February 1794, amounted to nearly £.1,300. Mr. Taylor, who was bo good as to show me the catalogue, thought that a similar collection would sell now for £10,000." Hoth these Catalogues have purchasers' names and the prices of the lots added.

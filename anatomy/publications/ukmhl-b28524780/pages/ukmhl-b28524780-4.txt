l2 Mr Wardropâ€™s Sketch of the Life and Writings intermingled and so closely linked with the happiness and pros=^ perity of mankind, that he who makes use of his best efforts and an honourable zeal in cultivating a liberal profession, and employs' the energies of his mind in devising means to alleviate the dis- tresses of his fellow-creatures, has a just claim on public gratitude and esteem. Impressed with these sentiments, 1 have thought that some account of the life and writings of the late Mr Gibson might not be unacceptable to the medical public, not only as offering a small tribute of respect to the memory of an individual, who must have been regarded as one of the brightest ornaments of his pro- fession ; but also as affording an opportunity of giving a sketch of his valuable writings, and of the interesting improvements he made in different branches of surgery. Mr Gibson was born in September 1774, at Newcastle upon Tyne, of most respectable parents, whose situation in life afford- ed him all the usual means of obtaining a liberal education. From the age of eight to that of seventeen, he remained at an excellent school kept by Mr Temple, at Richmond, in the north Riding of Yorkshire. Having there laid a good foundation* of classical and general literature, he began his medical pursuits by serving an apprenticeship of five years to Mr Ingham, a surgeon of Newcastle, whose celebrity was not confined to that town and neighbourhood, but extended over a wide circle of the surround- ing country; and who still enjoys the same honourable rank in his profession, though prevented by advanced years and impaired health from undergoing its more fatiguing duties. In this situa- tion, Mr Gibson had an opportunity of learning the rudiments of his profession, and acquiring that facility of discriminating diseases, and readiness in the application of the curative means employed in medicine, which seem only to be easily and eminent- ly obtained by practice in early life, a facility which those more advanced in years can never acquire but with unwearied dili- gence and labour. In the year 1796 he went to London, chiefly with a view to prosecute his anatomical studies under Dr Baillie, at that time the most eminent teacher in the metropolis. It was in this depart- ment of his pursuits that he first made a conspicuous figure amongst his contemporaries. From early youth he had evinced a very unusual mechanical talent, and possessed an extreme nicety in mechanical execution. These, with a most persevering and well-directed assiduity, were applied to anatomical researches, and it may be readily conceived, that thus gifted, the dissections which he performed, and the numerous preparations which he made, possessed a neatness, and displayed an anatomical skill almost

How this wonderful process of transformation is eftected, it is impossible to say; each secretion is formed in its own peculiar laboratory, and all have their separate and dis- tinct properties and uses. The human machine is, by necessity, subjected to perpetual decay, and of course, continual re- production is requisite to repair and preserve the perfect state of the structure. We have seen that this renovation is eflâ€™ected by the plenteous dis- tribution of blood but we have next to consider how the supply of blood is kept up.

Numberless other instances might easily be adduced in support of this point, but the next thing to be considered, is, upon which of these animals reason could have been more fitly bestowed than upon man? or, in other words, which structure is better adapted for the exercise of its dominion ? Let us imagine any one of these animals to have been gifted, instead of man, with his intellectual powers, and to have all his varied actions and objects in life to pursue and to fulfil; suppose an Elephant attempting to make a watch, or a Horse to write a letter, and the utter inefficiency must strike every one. No! the frame of man, and of man alone, was formed and calculated for the dominion and ex- ercise of reason! Look at the human being, during the period of infancy; he is at once the most helpless and the most dependant creature in the animal kingdom. There is no other animal so long in arriving at the maturity of his powers, —nay, even in attaining the period when he is capable of providing for his own immediate necessities. Look at the naturally erect position of the body—that noble attribute, which, not- withstanding the strange theories of Daubenton and Barthez, is now ascertained to be the peculiar characteristic of man. ^ D

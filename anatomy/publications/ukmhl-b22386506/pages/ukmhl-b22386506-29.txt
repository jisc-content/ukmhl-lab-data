21 at the same time it powerfully supports what has just been advanced. Where the bones are connected together to form joints, their opposing surfaces are coated with cartilage as smooth, as polished and as bright as the finest glass, and lubricated with an oily fluid, which is secreted there for the purpose; and thus the fatal effects of friction are obviated, and, to take an example, the knee joint, which, by the lowest computation, is used eight millions of times in a year, is at the expiration of that time as perfect as ever. The joints are duly con- fined, protected and strengthened by numerous ligaments, which prevent their exceeding the proper limits of their motion, and thus guard against dislocations. > To set these joints in play, and at the same time govern and direct their motion, is the office of the muscles. At their insertions near the joints the muscles terminate in tendons, by which means a condensation of power is obtained, and the beauty of the figure is consulted. This last object is still further enhanced by the cellular membrane, which fills up all the interstices be- tween the muscles, and rounds off the limbs. Over all is extended the highly elastic membrane of the skin.

20 instances. The hypothesis, therefore, which was formed on the supposed correctness of this theory, (and which is also anticipated by Soemmerring-,) must likewise fall to the ground. Let us next take a brief survey of the different parts and organs which constitute the Human Structure. As the basis and groundwork of the frame, we have the Bones; these are firm and unyielding in their texture, give support to the softer parts, furnish a fixed medium of attachment for the muscles and ligaments, and afford a valuable de- fence to the more delicate and vitally important organs. But firm and unyielding as the bones are, still from their exquisite arrangement and from the number and perfection of the joints, and other admirable contrivances by which they are connected together, the motions which man is capable of performing are collectively more free, more extensive, and more numerous than those of any other animal. The human skeleton consists of no less than 249 Bones, a number which cannot but strike us as amazing, though vero rccentiores anatomici exaclius earn proportionem per varia animantium genera examinarent, multa profecto inveniebaut animalia, imprimis inter simias minores, mures et aves, quoe pondere ciicephali, comparato cum reliqui coiporis pondere, hominem superarent.'^ Soemmerring de bas.

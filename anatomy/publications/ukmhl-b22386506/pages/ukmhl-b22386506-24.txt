16 sliort years back, would have believed that ships and carriages would ever have been propelled by vapour? or that oil or coal could have been made to yield the brilliant gaseous light with which this room is now illuminated? Yet these are but specimens of the many and wonderful, and yet common and daily proofs of his restless in- genuity and invention. It is not however in his intellect only (as many philosophers would have us believe) that man is so superior to the rest of the animal creation; he is also pre-eminently superior in his physical formationâ€”that is, in the admirable adaptation of his structure for the fulfilment of all the various purposes which his reason dictates. No one can pretend to deny that numberless animals are possessed of certain attributes and qualities in a far greater state of perfection and power than man: thus the mighty Elephant, the fierce yet noble Lion, or the huge Leviathan, have infinitely greater bodily force and strength: the Deer, the Horse, or the Grey- hound, possesses far superior swiftness of foot: the soaring bird of Jove, or the bright-eyed Hawk, has far greater capabilities for velocity of motion, and a far more piercing and powerful vision: the Pointer Dog excels man beyond comparison in acuteness of smell; and the Canary Bird not only surpasses him in natural melody.

PREFACE. It is almost unnecessary to state, that the following* pages contain but a brief and rapid sketch of the subject proposed. The observations are, principally, of an introductory nature, and their chief aim and end, the removal of certain prejudices prevalent against the prosecution of Anatomical and Physiological Science. With such an object in view, this pamphlet is, with confidence, presented to a discerning yet in- dulgent public. Albion-Street, ? Hull, Feb. 29, 1828.)

22 This then concludes the description of the parts which serve for the purposes of locomotion, but we have yet to enumerate other, if not more important, yet more vitally necessary, organs which lie concealed in the various cavities of the body. In the large and spacious hollow of the chest, confined and protected by the bony compages of the ribs, we have that indispensable part of the animal economy, the Lungs, hy which respiration is carried on, and in which the blood undergoes that peculiar process termed Oxydation, and is changed from a deep purple, to a bright scarlet colour. Here also we find the wonderful centre of the circulating system, the Heart, that living fountain which impels the healthful tide of life, through its mighty rivers and their innumerable branches, to every individual part of the micro- cosm, there to bestow its finer particles for the repair of all the various structures; the grosser portion is taken up by other communicating streams with their corresponding ramifications, is mingled with the chyle or new blood, poured in by the tributary branches from the absorbent system and returned in one vast purple current to the goal whence it set out; thence it is impelled through the lungs for the purpose of purification.

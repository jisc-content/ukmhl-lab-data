9 of (lig’estioii and absorption, of assimilation and secretion are still actively carried on, the three last with even greater vigour than when awake. This hypothesis is certainly supported by observ- ing the comparative duration of sleep at the different periods of life. In early childhood, when the most rapid evolution of the organs and the most active growth of the limbs is required, sleep occupies the greater part of the day; as we advance in years, less rest is required, and when arrived at maturity, about one-fourth or from that to one-third of the twenty-four hours is sufficient, and in old age the sleep is seldom sound or of long duration, and apt to be influ- enced by the slightest causes. To return from apoj)lexy. In proof of the latter theory, the case of the Parisian beggar was cited, who had a perforation in his skull, through w'hich the brain might be compressed. On the application of a finger to the part, and gentle pressure being made, the man fell into a kind of apoplectic sleep. It is needless to multiply theories on this subject, we know nothing of the actual nature of sleep, although it is pleasing to investigate and unravel the various phenomena which it manifests. Dreams and somnambulism, are amongst the most extraordinary of these phenomena—of the latter state, many wonderful cases are on record, and it is a state of extreme peril, from the absence of the senses to guide the sleepwalkers during the many and strange situations they are impelled to seek. The lovers of the marvellous have strange ideas of the dexterity of these somnambulists in avoiding danger, but when it is remembered that they are acting entirely from the remembrance of former impressions, and without the use of their senses, this opinion will at once be seen to be erroneous, and like many other marvels en- tirely without foundation.

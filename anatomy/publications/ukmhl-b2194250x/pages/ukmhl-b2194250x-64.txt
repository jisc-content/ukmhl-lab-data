50 01' THE EAR AND THE AUDITORY NERVE. sawing through the glenoid cavity, so as to leave the membrane of the tympanum and Eustachian tube perfect. In this portion the cavity of the tympanum may be laid open, by cutting away with a strong knife or chisel a thin piece of bone which is at the side, and opposite the middle of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and between its sharp edge and the squamous portion, which will expose the hammer and anvil. Then the Eustachian tube must be cut open quite into the tympanum. In this dissection, the tympanum will be seen communicating backwards with the mastoid cells, and at the same time the situations of the four small bones must be observed: that the hammer is fixed by its handle to the membrane of the tympanum, and that its slender process is articulated in a groove at the anterior part of the tympanum : that the body of the anvil is articulated with the head of the hammer, that its short leg is resting in a groove in the bone near the entrance of the mastoid cells, and after a little of the petrous portion, opposite to the anvil, has been cut away, that its long leg is joined to the very small orbicular bone: that the stirrup goes across the tympanum, its head being articulated with the orbi- cular bone, and its base with the oval fenestra. To have these bones separate, and at the same time perfect, it is necessary to macerate a temporal bone

For giving the natural appearance to the muscles water colours may be used, by mixing together a little lake and vermilion on a palette, as in the usual way of painting. It is desirable not to have the colour too deep. As by this mode of making preparations the parts very soon become stiff, and must then remain in the same position they have acquired, it is necessary at first, or at furthest within the first two or three days, to put every part in the exact place it is intended it should keep, and with this view it is proper to observe occa- sionally the progress of the preparation, until the parts have become so hard as to preserve by themselves their proper situation. Although a preparation may not frequently be spoiled by leaving the parts to dry in the situations they first acquired after being suspended, yet much may be added to the appearance by attending to this seemingly trifling circumstance ; for instance in the

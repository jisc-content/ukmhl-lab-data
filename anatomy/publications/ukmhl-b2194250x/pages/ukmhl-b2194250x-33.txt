19 ON THE PREPARATION OF AN ARM. CHAPTER V. ON THE PREPARATION OF AN ARM, AS A GENERAL ILLUSTRATION OF A NEW METHOD OF MAKING DRIED ANATOMICAL PREPARATIONS. A LIMB being chosen as free* from fat as possible, a solution of two ounces of oxymuriate of mercury in half a pint of rectified spirit of wine, is to be injected into the arteries ; and the next day as much as possible of white spirit varnish, to which one fifth part of tur- pentine varnish has been added, and some vermilion : the limb is then to be put into hot water, where it is to remain until properly heated, when the coarse injection is to be thrown into the arteries and veins, if required. If the veins are to be injected, it is better to wash the blood out of them with water before the solution of oxymuriate of mercury is thrown into the arteries, as some of this will return by the veins, and coagulate the blood contained in them, so as to prevent the injection from passing into the smaller branches. c 2

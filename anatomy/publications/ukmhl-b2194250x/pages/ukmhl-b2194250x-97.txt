THE NERVES OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. 83 for allowing the nerves placed behind these parts to be readily dissected. For the purpose of exhibiting all these nerves dry, either a series of preparations must be made or several small portions of the intestines only left, which must be distended with air. The stomach must have a con- siderable portion removed from its large curvature, the remaining part must then be filled with cloth or horse hair and sewed up in the form of a contracted stomach. Without these diminutions the nerves will be hidden. The rectum and bladder may be very moderately dis- tended, and a bougie passed into the urethra. When the parts are sufficiently dry, the end of each portion of the intestine, and the sewed edges of the stomach may be cut off, and the hair removed from the rectum ; the bougie cannot easily be drawn out, it may therefore be cut off close to the orifice of the urethra and left; all these parts must th-en be varnished, and the mus- cles, nerves, &c., treated according to the preceding directions. If the preparation be kept in spirits every part of the stomach and intestines should remain perfect. G 2

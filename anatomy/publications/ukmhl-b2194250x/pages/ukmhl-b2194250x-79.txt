PREPARATIONS OF THE FIFTH NERVE. 65 of the facial nerve may be dissected, and the commu- nications between these and the superficial temporal nerve will be particularly seen. If the arteries have been injected, branches may be traced upon these from the third of the fifth, to communicate with others from the spheno-palatine ganglion. Another preparation may be made in the following manner. Dissect the branches of the facial nerve, divide the lower jaw about an inch and a half from its median point, and then the zygomatic arch, and the attachment of the temporal muscle to the coronoid process; divide also the capsular ligament, and remove the upper branch of the jaw. Some of the branches of the third trunlTmay then be traced ; viz. the chord of the tympanum, as far as the foramen of Glaser; the filaments of the superficial temporal to the auricle, and the membrane lining the meatus; part of the bone forming the anterior boundary of this should be removed. The digastric branch of the facial nerve, giving filaments to the retracting and attollent mus- cles of the ear, and its communications with the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, may also be exhibited. F

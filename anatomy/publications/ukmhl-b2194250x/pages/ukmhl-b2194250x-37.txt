Another hole is to be made near the middle of the wood, by which it is to be tied to the screw. When the- limb is suspended it is to be wiped with a piece of clean linen, and a small bit of wood should be put between the tendons of the perforated and perforating muscles near the wrist, and then the nerves, tendons, and tendinous expansions

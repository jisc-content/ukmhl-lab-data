20 ON THE PREPARATION OF AN ARM. After the limb has been injected, it is to be dis- sected. Evei-y time it is left, and even sometimes during the dissection, it is advisable to cover those parts which have been exposed with a cloth made damp with water. If from change of weather or other circumstances it has become suddenly putrid, and it is probable the time required for finishing the dis- section will be so long as to lead to a supposition that many of the parts will be destroyed before this can be accomplished, it may be immersed in the solution for a day or two, according to the directions for stopping putrefaction. It is necessary that the dissection should be con- ducted in a different manner from that frequently adopted for making preparations, by exposing the blood vessels at the expense of every other part, but preparations made according to the directions herein- after detailed will most commonly be good or otherwise in proportion to the pains that have been taken in the dissection. All the fat and cellular membrane should be removed. The muscles*, tendons, arteries, veins, nerves, and ligaments, which it is intended to exhibit * The different portions of each muscle, as far as they are con- nected by celhilar membrane only, should always be separated except when the surrounding- parts will be injured by so doing-.

6 ON PREVENTING PUTREFACTION punctures should be made through the fascia, Sec. covering them with a sharp-pointed knife. If putre- faction appears to have stopped, and the subject is put into the solution or water, and if the cavities of the chest, &c. are filled with the fluid, and it does not sink, it may be concluded that putrefaction is still going on in the deep parts, and these will be entirely spoiled if not exposed so as to allow the solution to reach them sufficiently early. The cavities of the chest, &c., and spaces between the muscles, do not at once get filled with the fluid, and therefore by putting the hand into the cavities, or pressing the muscles whilst the subject is immersed in the fluid, the air will escape, and its place become occupied by the fluid, and it will then be properly known whether it be atmos- pheric air contained in those parts that prevents the sinking, or that arising from putrefaction, and con- tained in the cellular membrane, &c. When the body has been thoroughly impregnated with the solution, the flesh assumes a pale appearance, and there is no foetor arising from it. It is not after this necessary to put it into the solution, but only to keep it covered with wet cloths, whilst it is placed on the table ; and, when becoming too dry, to immerse it in cold water for a day or two, or if it be not wanted, even for several weeks, as no decomposition

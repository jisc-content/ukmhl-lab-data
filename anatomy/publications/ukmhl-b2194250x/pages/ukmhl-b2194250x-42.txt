Though a preparation will seldom be greasy if due care has been taken to remove all the fat, yet this will sometimes be the case. And the best method of cleaning it in such a state, and of preventing a further exudation of grease, will be to rub it as clean as pos- sible with a piece of soft rag, and then to wash it well with the solution of acetate of lead, which should the next day be applied by means of a brush, and, when perfectly dry, repeated in the same manner several times, after which the part must be covered three or four times with white spirit varnish. The preceding method of making preparations im- parts all the advantages detailed in the introduction, but if the shrinking of the muscles be not an object, much trouble will be saved by having a limb injected in the common way, first with a little varnish and red lead, and then with coarse injection: and, indeed, when it is wished to make a preparation of the minute arteries, the usual method will be found the best, because after the solution of oxymuriate of mercury has first been injected, the coarse injection will not generally fill the vessels so well as will thus be required.

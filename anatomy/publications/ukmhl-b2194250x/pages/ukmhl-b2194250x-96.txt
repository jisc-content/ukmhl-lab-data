82 THE NERVES OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. raising the colon may be easily destroyed. It must be carefully separated from this part along with the artery and vein, and when it has been sufficiently loosened, the cellular membrane and branches of veins may be easily removed from it, and particularly if a piece of card is placed behind it. Each hypogastric plexus passes into the pelvis at the back of the bladder, and communicates with some of the sacral ganglia; it receives branches from the third and fourth sacral nerves, and forms a membranous expansion towards the lateral and posterior part of the bladder, which gives off branches to terminate in the bladder, rectum, vesicula seminalis, vas deferens, and prostate gland. These nerves should be dissected as much as possible in the preceding order. Great care and nicety are required, for if the mesentery and mesocolon be de- stroyed, much confusion will be created and the dis- section made very tedious and unsatisfactory. It will be necessary to separate the peritoneum from the abdominal muscles on each side, and on proceeding towards the loins, the colon on each side will be raised from its cellular attachments, and thus every facility of turning the right portion of this intestine to the left side, and that of the left, to the right will be afforded

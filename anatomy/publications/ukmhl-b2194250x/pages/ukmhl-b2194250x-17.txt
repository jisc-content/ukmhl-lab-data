BY OXYMURIATE OF MEUCURY. 3 became again in the slightest degree putrid, altliougli the greatest part of the oxymuriate of mercury was thus washed away. Numerous dissections were made by putting subjects in the solution in different stages of putrefaction, and always with the effect of arresting its progress, and allowing those to be dissected that would otherwise have been entirely useless. For the sake of explanation it may be supposed that the skin of a portion of a subject has been removed, and the muscles, &c., separated in some degree, it may be placed in the solution of oxymuriate of mercury for two or three days; or if it be probable that the veins contain much blood, as many of these as possible should be opened, and the subject im- mersed in water for a few hours, for the purpose of removing the blood before it is put into the solution, as this coagulates the blood, which is then not only troublesome to remove, but produces much dis- colouration of the surrounding parts. When the sub- ject is taken out of the solution, it should be immersed in cold water for a few hours, both for preserving the instruments and preventing soreness of the hands, but these inconveniences may be obviated by smearing them with a little oil.

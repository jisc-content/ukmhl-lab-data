PREPARATIONS OF THE BRAIN. 41 orbital foi-araen should be cut away; and the third, fourth, and first trunk of the fifth and the sixth nerves should be traced to the orbit; the fifth should be traced to the Gasserian ganglion, and the second trunk to the round foramen, and the third to the oval one. The bone of the upper part of the internal auditory meatus should be cut away, and the auditory and facial nerves shown. The superior branch of the Vidian nerve should be exposed by removing the dura mater, on the outer surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, where it will be seen entering the aqueduct of Fallopius to join the facial nerve. By removing the inferior part of the lateral sinus, the glosso-pharyngeal, the par vagum, and the accessory^ will be also seen ; but it is still better to remove such a portion of the occipital bone as will open into the great foramen, care being taken not to destroy the ninth pair.

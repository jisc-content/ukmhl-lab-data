BY ALCOHOL. A A immersion in water for many days, so that the nerves and muscles do not become inordinately enlarged, whereas when a subject has been thoroughly saturated with alcohol, and is placed in water, all the cellular tissue becomes distended, and every part assumes a woolly appearance: the muscles and nerves conse- quently become enlarged beyond their original dimen- sions. The use of alcohol, therefore, requires more management and trouble than that of the solution ; but nevertheless, for the most minute dissections, it is to be preferred, because the terminations of the nerves in particular will admit of separation to a much e-reater degree of minuteness than the solution will allow. Common salt does not harden the cellular tissue like the oxyrauriate of mercury, and it may be used in the following manner, but only with the view of saving alcohol. Say that a subject has been procured for a dissection of the sympathetic nerve, and the nerves of the abdominal and thoracic viscera. After it has been opened in a manner that will hereafter be explained, and there is a tendency to putrefaction in the muscles, and a very offensive smell in the viscera, if it be at once immersed in alcohol, the whole of this fluid will be spoiled by the admixture of blood and the juices that had penetrated the coats of the viscera, and could

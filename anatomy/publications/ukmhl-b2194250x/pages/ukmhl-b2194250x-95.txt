THE NERVES OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. bi many of the brandies of this plexus are best observed and most easily dissected on the posterior surface of the emulgent artery. The aortic plexus is composed of branches of the semilunar ganglia, and those of the lumbar portions of the sympathetic nerve of each side. It is situated princii)ally upon, and at the sides of the aorta. It gives off the inferior mesenteric plexus to accompany the branches of the inferior mesenteric artery, to terminate on the left side of the colon and the rectum. It then divides on the last lumbar vertebra into right and left hypogastric plexuses: it forms communications with the emulgent and spermatic plexuses; it gives fila- ments to the ureters and the coats of the arteries j it communicates with the superior mesenteric plexus and sends branches on the colic branches of the superior mesenteric artery to terminate on the right side and the arch of the colon. The dissection of each spermatic plexus requires particular nicely ; it receives communications from the emulgent and the aortic plexuses. It follows the spermatic artery to the testicle and is joined neav this part by a filament from the hypogastric plexus accom- panying the vas deferens. It usually adheres in some degree to the posterior part of the mesocolon and in G

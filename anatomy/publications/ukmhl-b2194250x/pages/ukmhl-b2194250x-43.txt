ON PREPARATIONS OF THE MIxVUTE NERVES. S9 CHAPTER VI. ON PREPARATIONS OF THE MINUTE NERVES. 1 It is supi30sed by many that young children are better subjects for dissections of the nerves than those of more advanced age, but this is a great mistake. In a child the nerves are certainly larger in proportion to the other parts than in the adult, and the larger nerves may be conveniently enough dissected in them, but it is not so with the more minute branches. Even in a very thin child so much fat is always found in different parts, as to make the dissection very tedious, besides the nerves have not appeared so strong as in the adult, so that much disappointment has been occasioned by their frequent breaking. The minute nerves of the face and neck are gene- rally the largest and most distinct in the male, and one should be chosen who has been originally strong and well made, between twenty and fifty years old, and as free from fat as possible. The nerves are almost invariably found more delicate in the female than in the male, and in very advanced age so much so as to be totally unfit for dissection.

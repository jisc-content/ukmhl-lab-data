ON PREPARATIONS OF 30 Although it may not be in the power of the ana- tomist to choose such a subject as he desires, yet for a dissection of the sympathetic nerve and par vagum one emaciated, but not destroyed by a disease of the lungs, is to be preferred ; for it generally happens in cases of this sort, that besides the disease of these viscera, all the absorbent glands and vessels of the neck and thorax are so much enlarged, and there is frequently such a thickening of the parts at the bottom of the neck, as to create a degree of confusion, which renders the dissection of the sympathetic nerve and par vagum sometimes unsatisfactory. What has been said about the choice of human sub- jects, as far as respects the age, does not apply in the same manner to animals, for in many of these, and especially the larger ones, the nerves in general are never so conveniently dissected as they are within a week or two after birth, because at that age they are generally more free from fat in every part than at any later period, as it is so difficult to procure such as have been in a diseased state long enough for all the fat to have been absorbed. It is better to separate most of the nerves from the fat before attempts are made to remove much of it, but in hot weather it becomes very soft, so that much of it may be absorbed by blotting paper, and then the remaining

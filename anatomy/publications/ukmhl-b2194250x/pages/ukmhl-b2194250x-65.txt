Each auricle should be left perfect by beginning to open the external auditory meatus, where the concha terminates. All the skin may be removed that sur- rounds it, and likewise all the flesh from every part of the skull, care being taken to leave the Eustachian tubes perfect. These parts may be thus made into preparations. One half of the skull may show the Eustachian tube entire, and its exact situation in the pharynx ; the other may show it cut open into the tympanum. If it is wished to show the semicircular canals and cochlea in one of these preparations, it may be done ; otherwise both parts may be put into the solution of oxymuriate of mercury for some time.

The soft parts may be covered once with mastich varnish, and when dry the muscular parts, &c. may be coloured if necessary.

58 OF THE EAR AND THE AUDITORY NERVE. of the hammer to join the facial nerve just at the entrance of this in the stylo-mastoid foramen, filaments may be traced to the laxator muscle of the tympanum. The fiicial nerve will be found in a canal passing down- wards and backwards, but before entering this it gives a filament to the tensor muscle of the tympanum, and at the posterior part one to the muscle of the stapes; in tracing the facial nerve at the posterior part of the tympanum to the stylo-mastoid foramen much of this part of the petrous portion must be cut away, and great care will be required to preserve the junction with the chord of the tympanum. There is another small nerve termed tympanine given off by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve just after this has emerged from the posterior lacerated foramen at the base of the skull. The small canal in which it passes must be laid open, and the side of the temporal bone with the external auditory meatus and membrane of the tympanum removed, and the nerve will be found entering the tympanum, and placed on that surface of the petrous portion, forming one of the boundaries of the tympanum, when it divides into filaments, one of which is sent into the carotic canal to join the sym- pathetic nerve, and another at the upper part of the termination of the Eustachian tube to communicate with the superior branch of the Vidian.

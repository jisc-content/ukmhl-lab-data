THE MINUTE NERVES. 37 brush at one time, otherwise it settles in drops on the nerves, producing adhesions or a knotted appearance, or fills up the meshes formed by different branches, and thus constitutes a confused mass. In some situa- tions it is necessary to interpose some very small bits of wood to keep the branches asunder until the prepa- ration is entirely finished. The muscles when dry must be painted red, with water colours ; and when the paint is dry, the whole preparation must be varnished, two or three times, with white spirit varnish and the best copal varnish. In making preparations of the cutaneous nerves of the arm, it is a great advantage to have both the arteries and veins first filled with coarse injection, as these nerves are confined to their exact situations by the veins. It may be thought, from the number of directions detailed in the foregoing pages, that the making of dry preparations of the nerves is very laborious, and takes up a great deal of time, but it can be safely asserted, that when the dissection has been well performed, a preparation may be completed with very little trouble.

Air the tendinous parts must at the same time be varnished as is required for other preparations, which must be done according to the directions given in the general illustration for the preparations of tendons. The following day the same process of varnishing and separating the nerves must be repeated. Using the varnish twice is generally sufficient for the minute branches, but the process of separating them must be daily repeated, until they are so dry as to keep the situations they were placed in. If more varnish is required than has been used, it will be known by the nerves not shining as things always do that are satu- rated with varnish; on the contrary, if too much is used, the branches will not easily be kept sufficiently apart to be distinct, especially where they form a net- work. In about a week the nerves will be sufficiently dry for being painted, but this process may be deferred for any length of time to suit the convenience of the anatomist. White paint, with a little drying oil, must be used, as often as may seem necessary, but twice for the smallest branches will in general be sufficient.

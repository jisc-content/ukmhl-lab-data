BY OXYMURIATE OF MERCURY. 9 and also produces a permanent discolouration of the preparation. Another box should be provided for such preparations or finished dissections as are to be kept in proof spirits. For the purpose of washing the subject after it has been in the solution, a large tub of the same length and width as the box, should be procured and placed under a tap for filling it with water; and for letting this off again, there should be a hole and plug in the bottom. It may be observed that muriate of soda, nitrate of potash, and other substances, may be used for putting a stop to putrefaction, but none of these answers so well as the oxymuriate of mercury j and if the parts are to be dried, the attraction of moisture from the atmosphere is a serious objection to their employment. It is not presumed that the plan here proposed, is the only one capable of accomplishing the desired object, but it is the best that has hitherto been had recourse to : doubtless other processes are known to different anatomists, but until these are communicated to the public, or more efficient ones invented, the present may be advantageously employed.

2 ON PREVENTING TUTREFACTION the same distinctness as when putrefaction has been stopped by some chemical process. By unbiassed persons it cannot be questioned but that the same knowledge, acquired by the usual method of dissecting, may be obtained from a much smaller number of subjects, and in a shorter time, when the putrefactive process has by any means been prevented. The discovery of a method of not only preventing the putrefactive process, but putting a stop to it when far advanced, must be an object of the greatest import- ance to the practical anatomist, but it must in a still higher degree be valuable to those whose health is so much impaired by putrid effluvia, as to make anato- mical investigations a constant source of risk and danger, and, most of all, to those who practise medi- cine and surgery in hot climates. Under such consi- derations very numerous experiments have been made, and the results have allowed the formation of such a plan, as will be found productive of every advantage that is possible to be derived from any process for putting a stop to putrefaction. It was ascertained that a piece of flesh, immersed in a solution of oxymuriate of mercury until it was completely changed, and afterwards put into a large vessel containing cold water for some days, never

PREPARATIONS OF THE FIFTH NERVE. 59 CHAPTER XII. PREPARATIONS OF THE FIFTH NERVE. The vertex having been removed, cut away by means of a chisel the orbital plate of the frontal bone, and the portion of the sphenoid forming the upper part of the superior lacerated orbital foramen ; then saw off the outer side of the skull by carrying the saw a very little within this part and almost close to its inner table, but so that it may remove a portion of the outer side of the orbit. Then, by dividing the dura mater, trace the fifth to the Gasserian ganglion. Observe the three trunks sent off from this; then cut away a piece of bone so as to expose the second and third trunks; in doing this the saw must first be directed obliquely from the exterior angle of the orbit towards the margin of the round foramen, and then from the glenoid cavity towards the margin of the oval foramen, and the remaining parts should be cut away with a chisel. The first trunk will be perceived passing through the superior lacerated orbital foramen, and may be traced by removing the orbital plate of the frontal bone.

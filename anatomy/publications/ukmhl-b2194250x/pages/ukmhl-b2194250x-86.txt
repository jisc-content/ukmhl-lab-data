72 PREPARATIONS OF THE PHARYNGEAL PLEXUS portions of the pericardium may be removed when the phrenic nerves have been traced to the diaphragm. Tlie tendon of the digastric muscle should be divided near the hyoid bone, and at the same time the insertion of the stylo-hyoid muscle may or may not be divided. The digastric branch of the facial nerve may be preserved, w^ith the filaments given from this to the stylo-hyoid muscle, and to communicate with the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The ninth, the par vagum, and the superior laryn- geal nerve, the first cervical ganglion of the sympa- thetic, the glosso-pharyngeal, and the accessory, must all be separated and made apparent, as from all these, branches communicating together, and forming the pharyngeal plexus, are sent to accompany the branches of the external carotid artery, and to terminate in the muscles of the pharynx; from this plexus, however, one branch is given off, termed the external laryngeal, to the pharynx and the crico-thyroideal muscle. The descending branch of the ninth should first be dissected, and then the par vagum separated through its whole extent, and the filaments given from this traced a little way towards the cardiac plexuses : the superior cardiac nerve and the branches from the prolongation of the sympathetic and its ganglia should then be

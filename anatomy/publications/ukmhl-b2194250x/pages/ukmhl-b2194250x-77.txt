PREPARATIONS OF THE FIFTH NERVE. 63 For a preparation of the dental nerves, the head of a youth should be chosen; the eye should be removed, and a portion of the bone forming the exterior boun- dary of the orbit, and the second trunk of the fifth should be traced from the round to the infra-orbital foramen, the dental branches will be observed entering the bone; the whole of the posterior part of the head, as well as the flesh, may be removed, and then this portion immersed in diluted muriatic acid; the ex- terior portions of the alveolar processes must be then cut away and the nerves traced to the teeth. The dissection of the nerves of the teeth of the lower jaw is much more easy ; the dental nerve will be seen to enter the jaw, and then all the flesh must be removed, and the part placed in diluted muriatic acid, when all the bone may be cut away that lies below the dental nerve, as well as that forming the external surface of the alveolar processes. One ounce of muriatic acid mixed with eight ounces of water may be used. If the fluid be too acid, it destroys the texture of the nerves. The bone should be immersed in this, and when the hardness is suffi- ciently removed from the part to be particularly dissected, it should be placed in water for a few hours, as thus the acid will be considerably removed, and the hands and instruments not so much affected by it.

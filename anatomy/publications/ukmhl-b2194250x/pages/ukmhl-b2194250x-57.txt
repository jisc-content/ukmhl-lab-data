AND ITS NERVES. 43 The exact situation of the ganglia will thus be known and avoided in removing other portions of bone. If it be wished to save all the branches of the posterior trunks of the spinal nerves, the muscles must be only divided on each side of the spinous processes, and no portion of them removed except in tracing the branches of nerves to their terminations. If the sympathetic nerve is to be preserved for showing its exact situation, with respect to the ganglia of the spinal nerves, or for tracing its connection with them, the sternum should be divided perpendicularly through its middle, and the ribs of the right side at their angles j so that the right half of the sternum with the anterior portions of the ribs attached to it may be entirely removed; the abdomen should also be opened by an incision between the straight muscles, and the viscera of the chest and abdomen taken out ; the sympathetic and its connexions with the spinal nerves should then be dissected, so that when the spinal canal has been opened at its posterior part according to the preceding directions, the remaining portions of the ribs of this side may be easily removed. The left side may remain as it was, and the branches of the posterior trunks be dissected to their termi-

94 OF THE PARTS CONCERNED IN HERNIA. anatomist, but if it be intended entirely for a prepara- tion of the parts concerned in hernia, it will be best to divide the subject about the beginning of the lumbar vertebrae, and then divide the pelvis through the sacrum and symphysis pubis, leaving about eight or nine inches of the thigh. It is best to remove the largest gluteal muscle and most of the muscles on the thigh, but this may depend on the wish of the anatom ist. When the dissection is finished, the part must be put into the solution of oxymuriate of mercury for about a fortnight. When it is taken out it should be suspended by a string fixed to the vertebrae, another being fastened to the corner of the abdominal muscles, so as to keep these parts and the transverse fascia on the stretch, and likewise to prevent them from falling too much in contact with the spine. When it is suspended, the tendon of the external oblique muscle, the transverse, and iliac fascia are to be covered with mastich varnish on three succeeding days. The tendon and fascia must be finished ac- cording to the directions given in the general illus- tration for the preparation of tendons. The edges of the external ring, and the separated portion of the tendon of the external oblique muscle, should be put in a proper position before they are quite stiff.

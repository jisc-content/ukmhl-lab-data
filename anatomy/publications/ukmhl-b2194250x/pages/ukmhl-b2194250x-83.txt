PREPARATIONS OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. 69 peritoneum from the abdomen. The three cervical sansHa will be found at the sides of the cervical vertebrÂ£e; ten or eleven thoracic ganglia about the junctions of the ribs with the bodies of the dorsal vertebra; from three to six lumbar ganglia at the sides of the anterior part of the lumbar vertebrtB, and the. five sacral at the inner side of the anterior sacral foramina; and the single ganglion, in which the sympathetic of each side terminates, will be seen at the inferior part of the sacrum. There is a continua- tion from one ganglion to another termed the pro- longation ; the third cervical usually sends one part of this over and another under the subclavian artery to the first thoracic ganglion. From the outer side either of the ganglia or the prolongation all the branches are given to the spinal nerves ; from the inner side the principal branches are given to form and commu- nicate with the nerves of the viscera of the chest and abdomen, and to give filaments to the arteries, the cellular membrane, the absorbents and ligaments. From the cervical portion some branches pass between the fibres of the long muscle directly to the cervical nerves ; these branches must be first exposed by dividing the muscular fibres, and it will then be seen which of them enter the vertebral canal to accom- pany the vertebral artery; tlie part of the transverse

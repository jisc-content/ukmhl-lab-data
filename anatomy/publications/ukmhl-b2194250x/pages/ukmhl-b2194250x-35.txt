ON THE PREPARATION OF AN ARM. 21 distinctly in a dry preparation, must be made distinct before any attempts are made to dry it. It must always be recollected that this method of making preparations is entirely different from that generally adopted. For in this, after the dissected parts have been subjected to the influence of the solution of oxymuriate of mercury, the moisture con- tained in them is merely dissipated whilst they are drying, and no ulterior changes take place during this process, so that every part that has been left will remain; whereas in the old method, not only during the time of drying, but long after the dissection has been completed, the putrefactive process still goes on in some degree, so that portions of cellular membrane, &c., that have been left, become so much decomposed as to be in a great measure easily removed by washing. If the directions that have been given are attended to, it will be easy to make the limb into a dry prepa- ration ; but if, on the contrary, these are neglected, it will be found tedious and difficult, and the method itself will be condemned, when the fault is wholly attributable to the slovenly mode of dissecting. After the dissection is finished, the limb must be immersed in the solution of oxymuriate of mercury

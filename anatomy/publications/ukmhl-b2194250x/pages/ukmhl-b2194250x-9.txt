PREFACE. Vll physiology and pathology have remained in much obscurity. Hitherto, after the nerves had been dis- sected, if it were wished that a re-examination of them should be made, it was necessary to keep them in spirits, for otherwise, after having been dissected a few days, very little could be made out respecting them. But keeping a subject for the nerves in spirits, is not only very expensive, but likewise inconvenient, and after all very unsatisfactory, for whenever there is occasion to examine it, there is much confusion and trouble in searching about for the nerves, besides the risk of destroy- ing many of the small branches. As a remedy for this inconvenience, a method of exhibiting the nerves dry, equally as well as the arteries, detailed in the following pages, will, it is hoped, afford every advantage desirable in making preparations of this system, as by it every dissection of the nerves may be preserved for any length of time in a dry state. Examinations of them may be made at any time, and with the utmost facility, so that every one may easily become familiar with their distri- bution. It need not be urged how much it must be for the advantage of a student to have a general know- ledge of the distribution of the nerves before he begins his dissections, and this he can easily gain by examining dry preparations, where every part is distinct, whilst it would be impossible for him to obtain such knowledge

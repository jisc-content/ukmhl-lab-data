AND NERVES OF THE THORACIC VISCERA. 73 traced, by carefully separating the carotid from its cellular attachments, and holding it towards the trachea, and it will be necessary to draw the trachea and pharynx forwards, by means of the chain hooks, for the purpose of keeping the parts a little on the stretch. When the carotid has been separated on its outer side, it may be necessary to do the same on its tracheal side, and particularly for seeing the branches of the recurrent, and their communications with the lateral cardiac plexus. It is, however, difficult to lay down precise directions; the parts must be carefully separated with the pointed instrument, and the dissec- tion conducted with the utmost caution. From the pharyngeal plexus, or the first cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, one or more filaments will be found passing behind the carotid artery, and forming the nerve called the superior cardiac. This will be found to communicate with other branches given from the prolongation of the sympathetic and its ganglia, and from the par vagum and recurrent, to form the lateral cardiac plexus, and from this some branches arise to pass on the branches of the subclavian artery, some over this vessel, and some underneath it, and communicate with the first thoracic ganglion ; and on the right side some smaller branches pass over the arteria innominata, but by far the greater part passes behind it to communicate with the auricular, ventri-

AND NERVES OF THE THORACIC VISCERA. 7^ its bifurcation; it communicates with each recurrent and the ventricular plexus, and sends branches before and behind the pulmonary artery to unite with others from the anterior pulmonary plexuses, to terminate in the auricles. The pulmonary plexuses must next be traced, each anterior one consists of a few branches of the par vagum and recurrent; some filaments go from it to the anterior part of the lung, and others to communicate with branches of the auricular plexus to terminate in the auricles. The posterior pulmonary plexuses are given from the par vagum at the root of each lung, and may be traced to follow the ramifications of the trachea; these also communicate with each thoracic plexus, and the ventricular plexuses, and must be traced to their terminations in the lungs, by following the branches of the trachea from the posterior parts of the lungs, at the same time the branches of the pulmonary artery and veins must be preserved. The thoracic plexuses consist of filaments from the two or three first thoracic ganglia ; these communi- cate with each other, by sending branches across the spine, and with the pulmonary and ventricular plexuses. The terminations and communications of these nerves

OF THE EAR AND THE AUDITORY NERVE. 53 perforated by many minute holes, through which the branches of the nerve go to the cochlea, and in the back part of this hollow are several holes, through which the branches of the auditory nerve go to the vestibule and semicircular canals. In the superior hol- low are two holes, the lower or smaller one for the trans- mission of branches of nerves into the vestibule, the upper or larger one for the transmission of the facial nerve, which may now be traced through its extent; it goes from the internal auditory meatus, between the cochlea and outer extremity of the superior semi- circular canal, it then passes over the superior edge of the oval fenestra, and then backwards and downwards, and terminates at the stylo-mastoid foramen. The bone thus dissected may be kept to show the parts that have been already described, or those of the labyrinth may be exposed in it. For making a preparation of the labyrinth, it is ne- cessary to begin to file about the middle of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and between its ridge and the cavity of the tympanum, and the superior semi- circular canal will be opened, and by tracing it towards the tympanum, will be found terminating in the vesti- bule, nearly opposite to the head of the hammer; the other extremity will be found terminating in common with the upper extremity of the posterior semicircular

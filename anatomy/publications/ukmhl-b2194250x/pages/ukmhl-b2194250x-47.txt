THE MINUTE NERVES. - 33 all events the minute nerves should be moistened from time to time with spirit of wine or water, as otherwise if suffered to get very dry they will be very liable to break. For making a preparation of the minute nerves, and for illustration, the sympathetic should be chosen. The integuments should be removed, and such other portions as are not required j the muscles, arteries, nerves, &c., are then to be carefully and partially separated, and the subject immersed in cold water for twenty-four hours ; the nerves thus become larger, stronger, and more distinct. The dissection must then be proceeded with for some days, when the parts are to be immersed in alcohol, or salt may be used iirst, according to some preceding directions ; for if a subject be kept in water too long, the nerves become enlarged, and the cellular membrane attached to them swollen out, but by putting it into alcohol they are con- tracted again to their natural dimensions. On taking the subject out of the alcohol, the nerves dry so fast and contract so much, as to make it absolutely necessary to have the parts not under dissection covered with a wet cloth, and the subject placed in cold water for a few hours once in every four or five days. It is thus by alternating the use of the water and alcohol, that the subject is kept in the most proper state for dissec- tion. When the dissection is finished, about two D

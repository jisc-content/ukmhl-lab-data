iv PREFACE. are really interested in anatomical inquiries, and giving them such further information as the following pages may have failed to communicate. There is a considerable difficulty in giving direc- tions for the dissection of the most complicated parts of the nervous system, but these have been attempted in a manner that appeared the best calculated for facilitating the progress of the student, and are published because so little information is given in books on the subject. It must, hov^^ever, be confessed, that verbal directions alone must be unsatisfactory, but if along with those reference be made to plates, after a perfect knowledge of the bones, and particularly those of the head, has been previously obtained, the dissection will be completed with facility and certainty. 6, Tavistock Square, September 14, 1833.

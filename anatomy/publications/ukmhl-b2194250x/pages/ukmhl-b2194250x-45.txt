THE MINUTE NERVES. 31 membrane that inclosed it can be separated without much difficulty or the risk of destroying the minute branches of skin on the tip of the nose andmargin of the lips. In dissecting the nerves of the neck, and indeed those that are minute in every other part of the body, the scalpel must be very little used, except for removing the skin ; for when the nervous branches are very nume- rous, it is next to impossible to separate them from the surrounding parts with an instrument of this kind, let the care and knowledge of the anatomist be ever so great. In a general way, the most convenient instru- ment will be one similar to a separate blade of a pair of scissors, made to cut like a knife, which may be pro- cured at Mr. Laundy's, St. Thomas's Street, Southwark. The student is not to cut straight forward when he is following a nerve, but he must take hold of the trunk, and separate it from the surrounding parts rather by poking and tearing away these than by cutting, although he may frequently use the cutting edge advantageously when he can see that he shall do no mischief. The instrument should generally be used by keeping the back of it to the subject, and directing the point to enter the part obliquely down- wards, so that in cutting forwards he will only divide the parts lying over the nerve; these divisions should be made by frequent short cuts, for as a nerve or a

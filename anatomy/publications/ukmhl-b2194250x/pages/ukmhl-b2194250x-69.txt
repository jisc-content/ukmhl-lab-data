OF THE EAR AND THE AUDITORY NERVE. 55 the tympanum. It is three twelfths of an inch from the entrance of the outer extremity of the superior semicircular canal into the vestibule ; in the foetus it is two twelfths of an inch. It must be opened by care- fully cutting away the bone with a knife, the point being inclined a little downwards towards the tympa- num. Wlien the cochlea is laid open, something like a pillar in the middle, going from the base to the apex, may be observed; the lower two thirds of which have been called modiolus, and the upper third infundibulum. The spiral lamina, which is a thin ^jlate of bone with a membranous edge, winds round the pillar; it begins at the round fenestra, and divides the cochlea into two canals called scalas, these two canals communicate at the apex where the spiral lamina terminates in a sharp point. To have a more perfect knowledge of the labyrinth it will be necessary to separate the petrous portion from the rest of the temporal bone; the remaining part of the shell of the cochlea must then be carefully removed so as to expose the whole spiral lamina, when it may be observed that one of the canals called scala tympani terminates at the round foramen, and the other called scala vestibuli, at the vestibule. The vestibule may be laid open either by filing away the bone between the internal auditory meatus, and the common termination

24 ON THE PREPARATION OF AN ARM. must be done over with mastich varnish, on this and the three succeeding days. The nerves must be painted as often as appears necessary with the white paint and drying oil. Care must be taken to paint the under sur- face of the nerves, as well as that which is superficial, if it can be done without much inconvenience. In several preparations no paint has been used for the tendons, and these preserved their character in a considerable degree, and it is therefore better not to do more than varnish them until the preparation is quite finished, and it may then be determined whether the paint will improve their appearance. Several of the tendons would look very well without paint, but in drying they do not all preserve the same appearance, and some of them assume a very dark colour, and particularly their tendinous parts or fasciae connected with muscles, it was therefore thought neces- sary to paint these expansions as well as the tendons, and thus keep a uniform appearance. To accomplish this object by other means, a great variety of different trials was made with varnishes, but as the results were unsatisfactory, others were made by adding paints to the varnishes, both with a view of rendering the pro- cess as simple as possible, as well as retaining the most natural appearances j and the rules laid down for

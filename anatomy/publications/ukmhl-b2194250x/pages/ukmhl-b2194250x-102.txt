PREPARATION OF THE NERVES 88 exposed, or its inferior extremity separated, so as to allow of its being turned aside; part of the internal jugular vein may then be removed, and the descending branches of the ninth, and its communications with the first and second cervical nerves traced. The great pectoral muscle may next be divided at about one- fourth of its breadth from its insertion ; the fat, &c., must be carefully separated at the inner edge of the biceps muscle, and the nerves exposed upwards towards the axilla, and also downwards towards the hand. Each dorsal nerve passing between the ribs may be exposed to within about an inch of the spine, and this distance is mentioned, as without more care than can be used in this stage of the dissection, the communi- cations with the sympathetic may be destroyed. The branches of the lumbar nerves may next be separated, which pass to the abdominal muscles, the spermatic chord, and to the skin of the thigh, as well as to form the anterior crural, the obturator, and the sciatic nerves; and the finger may be carried between the side of the bladder and pelvis for separating the cellular membrane, so as to allow the solution to penetrate this part. The cutaneous branches from the lumbar nerves, as well as the anterior crural and obturator nerves, may be traced in the anterior part of the thigh.

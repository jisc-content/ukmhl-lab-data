ON DHIED ANATOMICAL PKEPARATIONS. CHAPTER IV. ON THE ADVANTAGES OF A NEW METHOD OF MAKING DRIED ANATOMICAL PREPARATIONS. Every one who has paid attention to anatomy, whilst he has been convinced of the utility of dried preparations, must have regretted the difficulty of preserving parts, after much time and expense have been employed in dissecting them. The plan detailed in the following pages will not only prevent many of the usual disappointments of the anatomist in this respect, but add many advantages which dried pre- parations never before possessed. These advantages are : 1st. That the muscles do not shrink so much as they do in the usual method. 2nd. The tendinous parts are preserved distinct from the fleshy, so that the muscles have nearly the same appearances as when first dissected.

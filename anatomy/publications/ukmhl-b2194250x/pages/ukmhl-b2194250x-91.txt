THE NERVES OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. 77 CHAPTER XV. PREPARATIONS OF THE NERVES OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. The subject must be injected with coarse injection, as the nerves are thus not only more easily traced, but the delicate parts, such as the mesentery, &c. acquire some firmness, and are not so easily destroyed; it is however disadvantageous to have the minute arteries filled, as these are so numerous, and become so much intermixed with the nervous filament, as to make their separation very difficult and almost impossible. A part of a subject divided at the seventh dorsal vertebra will be sufficient: the diaphragm should be separated from its attachments to the ribs so as to allow all these, except the last, to be removed near their angles. The diaphragm should be left attached to the spine and the last rib. The penis should be separated from the pubes, and the internal pudendal nerves care- fully preserved, and the bone of the pubes and ischium and a great part of the ilium removed by sawing through the lattera short distance from the sacrum. The thighs should be removed at the hip joint.

AND ITS NERVES. I'J of tlie rectum. The dorsal nerves should be suffi- ciently separated near the angles of the ribs on the left side, for allowing these to be divided with the bone scissors, so that the cut ends may be of nearly the same length, and thus have a neat and even appearance when the sternum is thrown back. The bodies of the vertebrae will now be fully exposed, and portions of these may be removed by a saw so as not to penetrate the spinal canal. The nerves on each side, just on emerging from the canal, should be separated, and then the remaining portions of the bodies removed by the cutting forceps, or a chisel. The canal being opened, the dura mater may be divided, and the anterior bundles of nerves traced over the ganglia to join the posterior just at the termination of the ganglia. The remaining parts of the ribs of the right side may be removed, and the posterior branches of the nerves traced to the muscles and integuments. The symphysis of the pubes should be divided, and the right ilium dis- jointed from the sacrum, but, previously, the crus of the penis should be detached by carrying the knife so close to the bone of the pvibes and ischium, that the inter- nal pudendal nerve may not be injured. The anterior branches of the spinal nerves may be traced from the ganglia of the left side of the spinal chord, to their terminations. For the purpose of seeing particularly

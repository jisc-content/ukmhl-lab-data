BY OXYMURIATE OF MERCURY. 7 will be produced. When it is placed on the table, and covered with wet cloths, it is necessary to observe that the parts are not becoming mouldy, and should spots of this sort be perceived, the cloths should be washed, and the subject immersed in water for a day or two. It has been observed that the subject must be kept in the solution until any foetor ceases to arise, but if it has been very putrid, there will be a fetid exudation from the bones, which the solution will not remedy by mere contact, although all the flesh may have been sufficiently impregnated. It is best, therefore, when an adult is chosen, and it is not required to have the minute arteries filled with colouring matter, to inject it with the solution by one of the femoral arteries, as then the contents of the cancellated portions of the bones will become sufficiently changed for preventing decomposition. Or if it be wished to have the arteries minutely injected, white spirit varnish, with the addi- tion of some oil of lavender and vermilion, will tend greatly towards the attainment of the same purpose. The dissecting table should have round it a ledge of about three quarters of an inch deep, for the purpose of keeping the water from running on the clothes, floor, &c.; but for smaller parts a well-painted tray, or a large earthen dish will suffice.

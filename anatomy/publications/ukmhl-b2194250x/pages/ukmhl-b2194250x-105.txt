OF THE WHOLE BODY. 91 subject in the solution, if necessary; but if every part has been completely changed by this, the dissection of any portion may be proceeded with, and entirely finished. At the termination of the cutaneous nerves small portions of fascia should be left attached to the muscles, as the nerves will be thus kept in their proper situation, and much trouble and confusion prevented. When the dissection has been finished and the subject treated according to the directions in a former chapter, by placing it in the solution, &c., two holes should be made in the vertex, through which a string may be put for suspending it. The hands should be treated as in the preparation of an arm, and then fixed to such convenient supports, by means of strings, &c., as will keep them in the required position. A heavy weight should be suspended from each heel, otherwise the spine will be much shortened by the shrinking of the intervertebral substances, and the knees so bent by the contraction of the muscles of the thigh as to spoil the appearance of the preparation. It might be expected that every nerve would be particularly noticed in this work, but this would not have answered any useful purpose, as the general distribution of a great part of the nervous system may be easily understood with the assistance of books on descriptive anatomy.

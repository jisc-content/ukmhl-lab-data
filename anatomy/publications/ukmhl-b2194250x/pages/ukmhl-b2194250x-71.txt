OF THE EAR AND THE AUDITORY NERVE. 57 internal auditory meatus should be cut open, when the facial nerve will be seen at the inner or posterior side of the auditory nerve, and a distinct nervous com- munication found between them. The auditory nerve then divides into two parts, one to pass through innu- merable perforations in the modiolus of the cochlea, to terminate on the spiral lamina, the other portion to divide into three principal branches, to enter the vesti- bule, to be distributed on the ampullae of the membra- nous semicircular canals and the sacs of the vestibule. For a preparation of the chord of the tympanum a portion of a head is required, in which the gustatory nerve has been dissected, with the chord of the tym- panum entering the foramen of Glaser. The internal auditory meatus must be laid open, and the facial nerve traced from this to the aqueduct of Fallopius, and the superior branch of the Vidian on the exterior and upper surface of the petrous portion, and joining the facial nerve just after this has entered the aqueduct; the superior part of the tympanum and the squamous portion of the temporal bone should then be cut away, so that the whole of the membrane of the tympanum may be brought fully to view. The chord of the tympanum should then be traced from the foramen of Glaser: by removing the bone at the anterior part of the tympanum, it will be seen crossing the handle

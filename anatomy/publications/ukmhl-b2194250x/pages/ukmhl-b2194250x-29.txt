This solution has been found to answer some purposes better than that made with water, as in the hardening of brains ; but for common preparations of the whole body or its extre- mities it is not necessary. It is, however, best for injecting the arteries of a putrid subject, and particu- larly if this state is far advanced. It cannot, however, be denied that the preparations made with this are, in some respects, superior to those made with the solution in water, but not in that degree to compensate for the great additional expense.

PREPARATIONS OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. 67 on the half of an adult head, cut by a perpendicular section through the nose and occiput; for so much of the bone is removed in laying bare the nerves, and this part is so much weakened in consequence that it is very apt to break. This dissection should be made therefore on one that has not been divided, and if it be afterwards wished to have the dissected side only left, a perpendicular section must be made rather beyond the middle line, and thus sufficient strength will be preserved. Having exposed the trunks of the fifth, according to previous directions, divide the third near the oval foramen, and trace the second towards the orbit until it gives off the branch to the spheno-palatine ganglion, and from this the Vidian nerve will be seen to pass backwards in the spheno-palatine canal, which must be opened by gradually cutting away with a chisel and mallet the base of the pterygoid j)rocess, in which it is situated. The Vidian nerve will be found inclosed in a sheath of membrane, which must be opened and the superior branch traced to cross underneath the third trunk of the fifth, and over the carotic canal to the aqueduct of Fallopius; the inferior branch will be traced into the carotic canal, to join filaments on the internal carotid artery, communicating with the sixth.

OF SOLUTIONS OF OXYMURIATE OF MERCURY. 13 CHAPTER in. OF SOLUTIONS OF OXYMURIATE OF MERCURY. In using solutions of oxymuriate of mercury for anatomical preparations, it must always be kept in mind that unless animal substances are entirely changed, it must not be expected they will either be preserved from putrefaction or retain the properties of prepara- tions made according to the rules which will be laid down. When this solution was first used for pre- parations, the animal bodies were not submitted to its influence for more than a few days; and the consequence was, that when they had been kept for some time in a damp place, all the deeper seated parts emitted an offensive smell, or became mouldy, and had a very different appearance from the superficial ones.

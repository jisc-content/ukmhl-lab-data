14 OF SOLUTION'S OF The oxymuriate of mercury and muriate of ammonia must be rubbed together in a mortar, and then the water must be added gradually until the solution is complete. Though this solution no longer contains oxymuriate of mercury in the same state as when dissolved in alcohol, yet it has the effect of hardening animal bodies in the same manner. I have supposed that preparations made with this solution might be more liable to be affected by damp air on account of the addition of muriate of ammonia, but from the appearance of those made several years ago it is not probable that any injury of this sort will be sustained. A white precipitate is thrown down during the time an animal body is immersed in it, and should occa- sionally be removed, for if it be suffered to collect at the bottom of the box it prevents the free access of the solution to the subject, and then the necessary changes are not so well accomplished. For the ordinary purposes of dissection a solution of oxymuriate of mercury of half the preceding strength will be sufficient, as it will arrest , the putrefactive

90 PREPARATION OF THE NERVES of the penis, the anus, &c., may be exposed by care- fully separating the fat in the perineum. The large gluteal muscle on one side may remain whole, and on the other be divided across its fibres, so as to show the nerves going to it. The sciatic nerve will be thus exposed, as well as the posterior cutaneous branches passing down the thigh, and care must be taken that these are not divided with the gluteal muscle. The branches passing to the middle and smallest gluteal muscles just above the pyriform muscle, may be separated, and it is necessary to take care not to divide a branch of the sciatic passing to the geminous and quadrate muscles. The sciatic nerve may be traced down the thigh, and dividing into its several branches to terminate on this part, and the leg and foot, but of these it is not necessary to speak particularly. The preceding outline of the dissection may be fol- lowed as far as possible before the subject is put into the solution, but if it should become putrid before so much has been effected, it may be immersed once or oftener. When so much of the dissection has been done it will not even yet be advisable to finish every separate portion, but to trace all the nerves a little further and separate the muscles more, and again immerse the

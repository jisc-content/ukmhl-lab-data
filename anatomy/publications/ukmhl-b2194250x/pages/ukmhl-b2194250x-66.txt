5S OF THE EAR AND THE AUDITORY NERVE. will be necessary, in a macerated temporal bone, to saw off the squamous portion just at the superior part of the external auditory meatus; and then to lay open this and the tympanum, by detaching a piece of bone with a saw, which is first to be directed from the inferior part of the external auditory meatus, between the styloid process and the stylo-mastoid foramen into the inferior extremity, or beginning of the carotic canal, and then from the superior part of the external auditory mea- tus, into the superior part of the carotic canal. In the bone thus prepared, on the outside of the petrous portion, and about its middle, within the cavity of the tympanum, the oval fenestra to which the stirrup is fixed will be observed, and immediately below this a projection of the bone called promontory, and at the under part of this the round fenestra which is about one twelfth of an inch below the oval fenestra, and which in a recent bone is closed by a membrane; be- hind the round fenestra may be seen a hollow, which is the cavern from which the muscle of the stirrup originates. On the posterior or inner surface of the petrous portion may be observed the internal auditory meatus, the bottom of which is divided into two hollows by a sharp ridge. The fore-part of the inferior hollow is

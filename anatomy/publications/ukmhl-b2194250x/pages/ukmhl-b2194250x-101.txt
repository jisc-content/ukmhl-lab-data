OF THE WHOLE BODY. 87 in the following manner :â€”An incision must be made by keeping the blade of the knife horizontal, for the skin alone must be removed, and the fat and cellular membrane left, as the cutaneous nerves are very much imbedded in these parts ; it must be done in the same manner as in paring the yellow part of the rind of an orano-e from the white. If this be not removed now, the parts beneath will become putrid, as the antiseptic liquors cannot penetrate the cuticle, and not easily through the perfect skin; in the scalp, also, the skin must be carefully pared off, as many of the nerves will be destroyed by cutting too near. It will be best now to trace the nerves, and to begin by following the branches of the second cervical to the ear and face, and the parts about the angle of the jaw, and communications will be found between these and branches of the facial nerve. The parotid gland must be carefully divided, or removed by picking it out with a pointed instrument and the forceps, until the different branches of the facial nerve are exposed, each of which must be traced only a short distance at a time, for if one branch were to be followed entirely across the face, many communicating filaments would be divided. Other branches from the second and third cervical nerves may be traced to the different parts of the neck, and the acromion and clavicle. The sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle may next be entirely

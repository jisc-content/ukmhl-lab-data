60 TREPARATIONS OF THE FIFTH NERVE. The second trunk of the fifth, having passed through the round foramen, goes towards the inferior part of the orbit, but first gives off a branch termed malar. The orbital plate of the frontal bone must be cut away, and the portion of the sphenoid forming the upper part of the superior lacerated orbital foramen; the second trunk must then be traced passing through the round foramen, and the portion of bone separating this from the superior lacerated orbital foramen must be very carefully removed, and the malar branch will be seen to come off directly from the second trunk, and pass through the inferior lacerated orbital foramen towards the outer boundary of the orbit in a process of the membrane lining the bone, and having proceeded a short way, to divide into two branches, the temporal and malar. The temporal divides into two more; one of these goes through a small hole in the malar bone, and then through some of the fibres of the temporal muscle, and communicates with the temporal branches of the facial nerve, passing through the temporal fiiscia; in tracing this branch the bone, forming the outer boundary of the orbit and placed above it, should be gradually cut down with the bone nippers, and as it passes rather obliquely through the bone, it is very easily divided in cutting away the bone. The other of the temporal branches goes forward to the lachrymal gland, communicates with the lachrymal nerve, and

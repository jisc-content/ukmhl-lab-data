612 THE SACRAL NEEYES. In the female the dorsal nerve of the clitoris is much smaller than the corresponding branch in the male ; it is similarly distributed. C.—The inferior limmorrhoidal nerve arises from the pudic nerve at the back of the pelvis, or it may come directly from the sacral plexus, and be transmitted throug^h the small sacro-sciatic foramen to its dis- tribution in the lower end of the rectum. Fig. 373. Fig. 373.—Dissection of the Perin^euji of the Male to show the Distribution of THE Pudic and other Nerves (after Hirsclifeld and Leveille). J On the right side a part of the gluteus maximus muscle and the great sacro-sciatic liga- ment have been removed to show the descent of the nerves from the great sacro-sciatic foramen. 1, great sciatic neiwe of the right side ; 2, lesser sciatic nerve ; 2', its muscular branches to the gluteus maximus (right side) ; 2", cutaneous branches to the buttock (left side) ; 3, continuation of the nerve as posterior middle cutaneous of the thigh ; 3, intei'nal and external cutaneous branches ; 4, 4, inferior pudendal branch ; 4', network of this and the perineal nerves on the scrotum ; 5, right pudic nerve ; 6, superior branch- or nerve to the penis ; 7, the external superficial i^erineal branch ; 7', the internal superficial perineal branch; 8, musculo-bulbal branches ; 9, hsemorrhoidal or cutaneous anal branches ; 10, cutaneous branch of the fourth sacral nerve. Some of the branches of this nerve end in the external sphincter and in the adjacent skin of the anus ; others reach the skin in front of that part, and communicate with the inferior pudendal branch of the small sciatic nerve, and with the superficial perineal nerves. Sum:mary.—The pudic nerve supplies the perin^eum, the penis, and part of the scrotum, also the urethral and anal muscles in the male ; and the clitoris, labia, and other corresponding parts in the female. It communicates with the inferior pudendal "branch of the small sciatic nerve.

(<:•) The tlurd pcrforatimj artery pierces the adductor mag-nus muscle, below the in- sertion of the adductor longus. and is distributed in a manner similar to the second perfor- ating- artery. (rO The fourth pn-foratinci artery, the termination of the deep femoral artery, passing backwards close to the linea aspera, is distributed to the short head of the biceps and to the other hamstring- mus- cles, and communicates with branches of the popliteal artery, and with the lower perforating arteries.

DOESAL MUSCLES OF THE TEUJN'K. short cranio-vertebral muscles. Of these muscles those included iu the first two groups may be considered as having their fibres passing out- wards from the middle : those in the third group as having their fibres passing inwards ; those of the fourth group as having their fibres pass- ing in a nearly vertical direction ; and those of the fifth group, confined to the upper part of the vertebral column and to the head, may be looked upon as combining some examples of the others. Seerati Muscles.—^The serratns posticus superior is a thin flat muscle, which arises from the lower part of the ligamentum nuch^e and from the spines of the last cervical and two or three upper dorsal vertebrae by a thin aponeurotic tendon forming about a third of the length of the muscle ; it is inserted by four fleshy digitations into the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs, a little beyond their angles. It is directed obliquely downwards and outwards, resting on the deep muscles and the angles of the ribs. The muscle is covered, excepting at its superior border, by the rhomboid and levator' anguli scapulae muscles. Fig. 216.—Dorsal Mus- cles OP THE Upper Part of the Trunk. (A.

The serratus posticus inferior, broader and stronger than the pre- ceding muscle, passes outw^ards and upwards to the four lowest ribs ; it arises, by a thin aponeurotic membrane from the posterior layer of the lumbar aponeurosis, and is inserted by four fleshy digitations into the lower borders of the last four ribs. The uppermost of those digitations is very broad, and covers in part the second ; the last, varying in size with the length of the twelfth rib, is entirely concealed by the rest of the muscle (see fig. IG5, p. 191). The serratus inferior is covered by

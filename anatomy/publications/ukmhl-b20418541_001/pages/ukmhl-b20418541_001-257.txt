237 QUADRICEPS EXTEXSOE CRURIS MUSCLE. Belations.—In this long course the muse of the thigh, obliquely inwards in the up] aspect of the limb as far as the knee ; below this it turns obliquely forwards to its place of attachment. The tendon of insertion, broad and expanded, covers the tendons of the gracilis and semitendi- nosus (a synovial bursa being interposed), and gives off one expansion which strengthens the capsule of the knee- joint by becoming incorporated with it, and another which blends with the fascia of the leg.

The sartorius is covered only l^y the fascia lata and the integument. It passes over the iliacus and rectus femoris mus- cles, the anterior crural nerve and fe- moral vessels, the pectineus, the adductor longus, adductor magnus, vastus intemus and semitendinosus muscles. The inner border of this muscle and the most pro- jecting part of the adductor longus form the sides, and Poupart's ligament forms the base, of a triangular space in the upper third of the thigh, through the middle of which the femoral artery passes. This usually receives the name of Scarpa's triangle. FayvV'f/V'.v—The sartorius has frequently been found divided into two parts similarly attached ; or the lower muscle is inserted into the femur or into the tendon of the normal one. The tendon of insertion has been found to end in the fascia lata or in absence of the muscle has also been noted. Le is directed over the anterior part i3r third, and vertically at the inner Fig, ISS, capsule of the knee-joint. Total The quadriceps extensor cruris, the extensor muscle of the knee, is divisible into four parts, one of which, the rectus femoris, descends from the hip-bone and remains distinct, while the other three,

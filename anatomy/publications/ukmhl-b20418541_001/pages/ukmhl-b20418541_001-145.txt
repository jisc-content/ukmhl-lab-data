COMPARISON OF THE ARM AND LEG BOXES. 12a Figs. 110 & 111.â€”Sketch OF THE Bones of the Thoracic and Pelvic Limbs so placed as to show corresponding parts in both. {A. T.) I The preaxial borders of both, limbs are towards the reader's right hand, and the dorsal or true ex- tensor surfaces are shown throughout the whole ex- tent of the limbs. The somewhat artificial repre- sentation given in these figxires cannot be obtained from a single view of the specimens in one position, but it is easily brought out by slightly shifting the bones or changing the point of view. The hu- meral tuberosities are separated so as to show them on the borders of the bone.

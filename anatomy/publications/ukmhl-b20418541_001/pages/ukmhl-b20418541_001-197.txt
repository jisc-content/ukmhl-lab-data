177 TAESAL AUTICULATIOXS. third and fourth metatarsal bones, after covering the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle. The short or deep-seated plantar liga- ment lies close to the bones, being separated Jrom the superficial part by some cellular tissue. Its breadth is considerable, its length scarcely an inch. One extremity is attached to the calcaneum in front of the long ligament, the other, somewhat expanded, to the under surface of the cuboid bone, internal to the tuberosity. The dorsal or superior ligament is a flat band of fibres which connects the anterior and upper surface of the calcaneum with the adjacent part of the cuboid bone. The internal or interosseous ligament is placed deeply in the hollow between the astragalus and os calcis, and is closely connected with the external calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. A separate synovial membrane lines this joint.

643 THE PELVIC NERVES AND PLEXUS. Separating" opposite the neck of the uterus, they are directed upwards with the blood-vessels along the side of this organ, between the layers of its broad ligament. Some very slender filaments form round the arteries a plexus, in which minute ganglia are found scattered at in- tervals, and these nerves continue their course in the substance of the organ in connection with the blood-vessels. But the larger part of the nerves soon leave the vessels ; and after dividing repeatedly, without communicating with each other and without forming any gangliform enlargements, sink into the substance of the uterus, penetrating for the most part its neck and the lower part of its bod}^ One branch, con- tinued directly from the common hypogastric plexus, reaches the body of the uterus above the rest ; and a nerve from the same source ascends to the Fallopian tube. Lastly, the fundus of the uterus often receives a branch from the ovarian nerve. (Fr. Tiedemann, Tab. Nerv. Uteri, Heidelberg, 1823 ; Robert Lee, in Phil. Trans, 1841, 1842, 1846, and 1849 ; and Snow Beck, in Phil. Trans., 1846, part ii. See also F. Frankenhiiuser, Die Nerven der Gebiirmutter, 1867.) The nerves of the gravid uterus have been frequently investigated, with a view to discover if they become enlarged along with the increase in size of the organ. It is ascertained that the increase wdiich takes place is confined, for the most part to the thickening of the fibrous envelopes of the nerves ; but it appears also, fi'om the researches of Kilian, that fibres furnished with a medullary sheath, which in the un- impregnated state of the uterus lose that sheath as they proceed to their distribution, in the impregnated condition of the uterus continue to be surrounded with it as they run between the muscular fibres.

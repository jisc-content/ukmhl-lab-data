so BONES OF THE THORAX. but on each side of the column a considerable extension of the cavity is produced by the backward direction of the posterior parts of the ribs, and thus the weight of the body is thrown further back and is more equally distributed round the vertebral column. At the same time a broad furrow is produced between the spines of the vertebrje and the angles of the ribs, in which are placed the erectores spinse muscles. The intercostal spaces are eleven in number, somewhat wdder above than below, and varying in width with the elevation or depression of the ribs. OSSIFICATION OF THE KIBS AND STERNUM. Tiie ossification of the ribs begins in cartilage posteriorly about the eighth week, and extends rapidly forwards, so as to reach the permanent cartilage about Fig. 25,—One of the Middle Ribs about eighteen or twen- ty years op age. (R. QUAIN.) 1, the principal piece or body ; 2, the epiphysis of the head; 3, that of the tuber- cle. the foui"th month. Subperiosteal ossi- fication contributes largely to their sub- sequent growth. After puberty the centres of two small epiphyses appear in the cartilage of the head and tubercle. These become united with the main bone before the twenty-fifth year. The ossification of the sternum begins about the sixoh month, and usually by Fig. 26. Fig. 26.—Ossification op the Sternum. (R. Quain.) A, the cartilaginous sternum before the middle of fcetal life.

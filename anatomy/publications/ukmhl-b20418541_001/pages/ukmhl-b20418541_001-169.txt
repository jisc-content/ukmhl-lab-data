THE SIIOULDER-JOINT. 149 down the humerus on the internal or inferior aspect, and is strongest on the superior aspect. It is so lax that the humerus separates from the glenoid cavity as soon as its muscular connections are detached. Superiorly and posteriorly the capsule is strengthened by the tendons of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor muscles, whicli are intimately connected with it as they pass over it to reach the great tuberosity of the humerus. Anteriorly the tendon of the subscapularis muscle comes into direct contact with the synovial membrane, which is prolonged upon it through an oval opening. The insertion of the capsule is likewise interrupted opposite the bicipital groove, to give passage to the long tendon of the biceps muscle. The coraco-humeral, or accessory ligament, is a broad bundle of fibres extending obliquely over the upper and outer part of the articu- lation ; it is attached to the root of the coracoid process, and thence descends towards the greater tuberosity of the humerus, intimately connected with the capsule. A few fibres of the coraco-humeral liga- ment project into the joint, and are inserted into the inner and upper part of the bicipital groove ; these have been called the gJeno-humeral ligament, and are supposed to correspond with the ligamentum teres of the hip joint.

The glenoid ligament is a firm fibrous band, about two lines thick, which is fixed to the edge of the glenoid fossa, and thus deepen;^

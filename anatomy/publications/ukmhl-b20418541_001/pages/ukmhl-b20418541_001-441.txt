421 THE INTERCOSTAL ARTERIES. and run outwards upon the bodies of the vertebrae, to reach the inter- costal spaces. They are usually ten in number—the upper intercostal Fig. 274. Fig. 274.—View op the Thoracic and Upper Part of the Abdominal Aorta, &c. ^ For the general descrip- tion of this figure, see p. 349. Tlie following numbers indicate the branches of the aorta; 1, placed between the origins of the right and left coronary arteries; 2, innominate; 3, left carotid ; 4, left subclavian ; 5, bron- chial ; 6, 6, oesophageal; 7, 7, intercostal arteries (sixth ^ind seventh) ; S, inferior phrenic ; 9, cceliac axis ; 10, below the superior mesen- teric and opposite the origin of the renal arteries; 11, 11, two of the lumbar ar- teries, space, and occasionally also the second, being supplied by the supe- rior intercostal branch of the subclavian ar- tery. Owing to the position of the aorta to the left side of the spine, the right aortic intercostals cross over the front of the verte- bra, furnishing small branches to their inte- rior, and are longer than the arteries of the left side. The vessels of both sides pass outwards behind the pleura, and are crossed by the sym- pathetic nerve : those of the right side also pass behind the oeso- phagus, the thoracic duct, and the azygos vein. In each intercostal space the artery, pass- ing outwards more ho- rizontally than the ribs, crosses the space obliquely, so as to gain the Icwer border of the upper rib near its angle.

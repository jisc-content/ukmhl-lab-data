VOMER. MALAR BONE. 51 maxillary fossa into the nasal cavity, and transmits the internal nerves from Meckel's ganglion and the nasal branch of the internal maxillary artery. THE VOMER. The vomer is a thin mesial bone, irregularly quadrilateral, and placed vertically between the nasal foss«. It articulates with the sphenoid, ethmoid, palate, and maxillary bones, and with the septal cartilage of the nose. It usually becomes united by anchylosis, at an early age, to other bones. The lower and back part of the vomer forms a thin mesial ]3late, while the upper and anterior part consists of two aU, rising on each side of a mesial groove, in which lies the septal cartilage of the nose. The al^ posteriorly are thick and expanded, and form the bifid posterior extremity of the bone, which rests beneath the sphenoid. The superior border of each ala articulates edge to edge with the lamella l^rojectiDg inwards at the base of the internal pterygoid plate, and Fig. 42.—The Vomer (A.

The inferior border articulates with the ridge or I crest which rises from the palate plates of the maxillary and palate bones. The posterior border, thin, smooth, and unattached, separates the posterior nares. THE MALAR BONE. The malar bone forms the most prominent part of the cheek, and divides the orbit from the temporal fossa. It articulates by a broad serrated surface near its anterior inferior angle witli the malar process ■of the superior maxillary bone, by a slender posterior process with the zygoma, by a superior process with the frontal, and, continuously with that, by the margin of its deep ]3late with the great wing of the sphe- noid bone. Between its sphenoidal and maxillary articulations a small portion of free margin generally intervenes, which doses the anterior

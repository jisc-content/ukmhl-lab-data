VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 480 (g) The middle tliyroid vein, likewise derived from tlie thyroid body, is placed lower than the superior thyroid. VENOUS CIRCULATION WITHIN THE CRANIUM. The part of the venous system contained within the skull consists of veins properly so called, and of certain channels called sinuses, which receive the blood from those veins, and conduct it to the internal jugular veins. The sinuses alluded to are spaces left between the layers of the dura mater, the fibrous covering of the brain. CEREBRAL VEINS. The veins of the brain are divisible into those which ramify upon its surface, and those which are placed within its ventricles. Yig. 305. Fig. 305.—Internal View of the Base of the Skull, showing the Sinuses op the Dura Mater, &c. (A. T.) 4 The sinuses of the dura mater have been opened, a small portion of the roof of the -orbit has been removed posteriorly on the left side, and the dura mater has been dissected so as to bring into view the arteries at the base of the skull, the venous sinuses and the trunks of the cranial nerves.

328 MUSCLES OF THE PERIX.EUM. The levator ani arises in front from the posterior surface of the pubis, near the symphysis and midway between its upper and lower Fig. 228. — Superficial view op THE Muscles of the Perin^eum IN the Male (modified from Bourgery).

Some of its fibres are also traceable upwards in the substance of the pelvic fascia above the level of the obturator. From this exten- sive origin the fibres of the levator proceed downwards and inw^ards towards the middle line of the floor of the pelvis. Its posterior fasciculi are inserted upon the side of the lower end of the coccyx ; the bundles immediately in front of the coccyx unite in a median raphe with those of the opposite sides as far forward as the margin of the anus ; the middle and larger portion of the muscle is prolonged upon the lower part of the rectum, where it is connected with the fibres of the external sphincter, and slightly with those of the internal; and lastly, the anterior muscular bundles pass between the rectum and the genito- urinary passages, and, descending upon the side of the prostate, unite beneath the neck of the bladder, the prostate, and the neighbouring part of the urethra, wdth corresponding fibres from the muscle of the o]opo- site side, and blend also with those of the external sphincter and deep transverse perineal muscles. The anterior portion of the levator ani, which arises from the ramus of the pubis, close to the symphysis and above the pubic arch, and also from the adjacent fascia?, is sometimes separated at its origin by areolar tissue from the rest of the muscle. From this circumstance, and from its connection with the prostate gland, it was described by Santorini, and since by Albinus and Soemmerring, as a distinct muscle, under the name of the levator irrostaiK. Its fibres- pass backwards parallel with the middle line. JRi'lailom.—The upper or pelvic surface of tlie levator ani is in contact with the recto-vesical fascia, the capsule of the prostate, and the lower end of the

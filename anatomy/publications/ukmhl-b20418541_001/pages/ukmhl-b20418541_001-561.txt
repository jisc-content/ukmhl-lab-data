511 THE SUPEEIOR MAXILLARY NEHVE. Internal branches.—These consist of the naso-palatine, and the upper and interior nasal, which ramify in the lining membrane of the nasal fossjB and adjoining sinuses. The V2)2)cv nasal are very small branches, and enter the back part of the nasal fossa by the spheno-palatine foramen. Some are prolong-ed to the upper and posterior part of the septum, and the remainder ramify in the membrane covering- the upper two spong-y bones, and in that lining- the posterior ethmoid cells. A branch, as has been already stated, forms a connection in the wall of the maxillary sinus, above the eye-tooth, with the anterior dental nerve. The naso-2>alatine nerve, nerve of Cotunnius (Scarpa), long- and slender, leaves the inner side of the ganglion with the preceding branches, and after crossing the roof of the nasal fossa is directed downwards and forwards on the septum nasi towards the anterior palatine canal, situated between the periosteum and the pituitary membrane. The nerves of opposite sides descend to the palate through the mesial subdivisions of the canal, called the foramina of Scar^ia, the nerve of the right side usually behind that of the left. In the lower common foramen the two naso-palatine nerves are connected with each other in a fine plexus ; and they end in several filaments, which are distributed to the papillce behind the incisor teeth, and communicate with the gi-eat palatine nerve. In its course along the septum, small filaments are furnished from the naso-palatine nerve to the pituitary membrane. (See fig. 402. This nerve was discovered inde- pendently by John Hunter and Cotunnius ; see Hunter's " Observations on certain parts of the Animal Economy; " and Scarpa, "Annotationes Anatomicte," lib. ii.) Posterior branches.—The branches directed backwards from the spheno-palatine ganglion are the Vidian and pharyngeal nerves. The Vidian nerve arises from the back pari; of the ganglion, which seems to Fig. 339.

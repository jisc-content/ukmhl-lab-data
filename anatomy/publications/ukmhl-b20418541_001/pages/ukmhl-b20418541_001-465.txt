445 THE INTERXAL PUDIC ARTERY. lies externally to the ischio-rectal fossa and internally to the obturator infeernns muscle, and beneath the triangular ligament it is crossed by the deep transverse perineal muscle. Branches. (r?) The 'mfcrlor or external hcrmovTlioulal arteries, two or three in number, incline inwards from the pudic artery as it passes outside the ischio- rectal fossa above the tuber ischii. These small vessels run across the ischio- rectal fossa, through the fat in that space, and are distributed to the sphincter and levator ani muscles, and to the parts surroiuiding- the anus. {h) The sv2>erjictul 2)erlneal artery, a long, slender, but regular vessel, supplies Fig. 285.

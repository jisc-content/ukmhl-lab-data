544 THE CEANIAL NEEVES. (e) Artlcnlar hrancli.—The nerve to the temporo-maxillaiy articulation comes from one of the preceding branches, or directly from the auriculo-temporal nerve. (/) Temporal 'brandies—One of these, the smaller and ijoster 'wr of the two, distributes filaments to the attrahens auriculam muscle, the upper part of the pinna and the integument above it. The anterior temporal branch extends with the superficial temporal artery to the top of the head, and ends in the integument. It is often united with the temporal branch of the upper maxillary nerve. Meckel mentions a communication between this branch and the occipital nerve. Lingual Herve.—The lingual branch (or gustatory nerve), descends under cover of the external pterygoid muscle, lying to the inner side and in front of the dental nerve, and sometimes united to it by a cord which crosses over the internal maxillary artery. It is there joined at Fig. 340. Fig. 340.—View of the Branches op the Inferior Maxillary Nerve from the OUTER SIDE (from Sappey after HirscMeld and Leveille). | The zygoma and ramus of the jaw have been removed, and the outer plate of the jaw taken off, so as to open up the dental canal ; the lower part of the temporal muscle has j been dissected off the bone, and the masseter muscle turned downa. { 1, Masseteric branch, descending to the deep surface of the muscle ; 2, a twig to the | temporal muscle ; 5, anterior, and 7_, posterior deep temporal nerves ; 3, buccal ; 4, its | union with the facial ; 6, filaments given by the buccal to the external pterygoid muscle ; [ 8, auriculo-temporal nerve ; 9, its temporal branches ; 10, its anterior auricular branches; j 11, its union with the facial ; 12, gustatory or lingual nerve ; 13,mylo-hyoid nerve ; 14, \ inferior dental nerve; 15, its twigs supplied to the teeth; 16, mental branches ; 17, ! branch of the facial uniting with the mental. 1

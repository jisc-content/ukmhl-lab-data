FEMORAL IIERNIiE. 341 is found to be divided into three compartments, by fibrous septa ; the outer compartment containing the femoral artery, the middle, the Fig. 239.—The Groin op the Right Side dissected so as to display THE Deep Femokal Arch. 1, the outer part of tlie femoral ■arch ; V, part of the tendon of the external oblique muscle, with external inguinal ring, projecting through which is seen a portion of the sper- matic cord cut ; 2, the femoral arch at its insertion into the spine of the pubis, and to the outer side the fibres of Gimbernat's ligament ; 3, the outer part of the femoral sheath ; 4, the spermatic cord ; 5, the deep femoral arch—its inner end, where it is fixed to the pubis; 6, internal oblique muscle ; 7, transversalis ; Tbelow this the transversalis fascia .continued into the femoral sheath under the deep femoral arch ; 8, con- joined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles ; 9, a band ■of tendinous fibres directed upwards behind the external abdominal ring. femoral vein, and the inner being occupied merely by lymphatic vessels, a, gland, and some fat. This inner compartment is about half an inch long, and from its being the passage through which the hernia descends, has been called the femoral or crural canal. The upper extremity of the canal presents a rounded aperture towards the cavity of the abdomen, usually of sufficient size to admit the point of the forefinger ; its size, however, varies in different persons, and it is larger in the female than in the male. This aperture is called the femoral ring, and is covered when viewed from the inside by peritoneum, and beneath that by the subperitoneal connective tissue, which here forms the crural septum (Cloquet). On three sides the ring is bounded by very un- yielding structures. In front are the femoral arches, the superficial being formed by Poupart's ligament, and the deep by a strong bundle of fibres, which, springing from the under surface of Poupart's ligament outside the femoral vessels, extends across the forepart of the femoral -sheath and widening at its inner end, is fixed to the pectineal line behind Gimbernat's ligament. Behind the ring is the hip-bone covered by the pectineus muscle and the pubic layer of the fascia lata ; on the -outer side lies the external iliac vein, but covered with its sheath ; and on the inner side are several layers of fibrous structure connected with the pectineal line—namely, Gimbernat's ligament, the conjoined tendon of the two deeper abdominal muscles, and the fascia transversalis, with the deep femoral arch. The last-mentioned structures—those bounding ■the ring at the inner side—present respectively a more or less sharp margin towards the opening. Relations to "blood-vessels.—Besides the femoral vein, the posi- tion of which has been already stated, the epigastric artery is closely connected with the ring, lying above its outer side.

THE SUPERIOR VENA CAVA. 473 the parts, and will be more fully referred to at p. 485, in connection with the description of the great cardiac vein. The superior vena cava in one case has been seen to be joined by one of the pulmonary veins (Meckel). In several cases two superior Fig. 302. venae cava? have been found, a rig-ht and a left, the left always opening- into the left auricle, and in one case being joined by a pulmonary vein.

"33 INNOMINATE OR BRACHIO-CEPHaLIC VEINS. The blood returned from the upper limbs through the subclavian veins, and from the head and neck by the jugular veins, is poured into two trunks, named the brachio-cephalic or innominate veins. These vessels, resulting from

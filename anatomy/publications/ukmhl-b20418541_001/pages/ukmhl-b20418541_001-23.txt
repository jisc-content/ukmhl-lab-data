PLAN OF ORGANISATIOX. 3 zng in almost all the animals formed upon this type the character of increased development of its constituent parts : and at the other the tail in which an opposite character or that of diminution prevails : while on the sides of the main part or trunk, there project in relation with some of the vertebral elements two pairs of symmetrical llinls in two situations, which are determinate and similar in different animals. The head and trunk contain the organs or viscera most important to iife, such as the alimentary canal and the great central organs of the sanguiferous and nervous systems, while the limbs, from which such principal organs are absent, are less constant and diff'er more in the degree of their development among the various animals formed upon the vertebrate type. The whole body may thus be regarded as being formed of an axial portion consisting of the head and trunk, and of appendicular portions comprising the limbs. In man and the higher animals especially, the trunk presents a division into the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The vertebrate form of skeleton is invariably accompanied by a determinate and comformable disposition of the other most important organs of the body—as first, by the existence on the dorsal aspect of the vertebral axis of an elongated cavity or canal which contains the brain and spinal cord, or central organs of the nervous system ; and second, by the existence on the ventral aspect of the vertebral axis of a larger cavity, the visceral cavity, in which are contained the principal viscera connected with nutrition, such as the alimentary canal, the heart and lungs, the great blood-vessels, and the urinary and genital organs. The general disposition of the parts of the body and of the more important viscera in their relation to the vertebral axis are shown in the accompanying figures of the external form and longitudinal and transverse sections of the human embryo at an early period of its •existence, when its structure resembles more closely that of the lower animals.

In the cranial part the divisions of the brain are indicated, together with the eye, and a u, the auditory vesicle ; near 6, the ventral plates of the head with the rudiments of the upper and lower jaws. These plates and the apertures between are represented in a state belonging to a somewhat earlier stage than the rest of the body.

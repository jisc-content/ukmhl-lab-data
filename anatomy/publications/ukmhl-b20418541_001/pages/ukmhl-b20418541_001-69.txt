PALATE BONE. 49 ascending process, for articulation with the inferior turbinated bone, and behind that process the lachrymal groove. Behind the lachrymal groove is the large opening into the sinus ; behind the sinus the sur- face is rough for articulation with the palate-bone ; and traversing the lower part of this roughness is a smooth groove, passing downwards and forwards from the posterior margin, and completing with the palate bone the posterior palatine or palato-maxillary canal. The orhilal surface extends from the margin of the orbit to the spheno-maxillary fissure, and is bounded externally by the surface for the malar bone, and internally by the lachrymal groove and a rough edge which articulates with the lachrymal, ethmoid, and palate bones. A groove commences in its posterior border, and leads forwards into a complete canal, the infraorl)ital, which opens anteriorly at the infra- orbital foramen. The maxillary si?ius, or antrum of Higlimore is a large cavity lying above the molar teeth and below the orbital plate, lined in the fresh state by mucous membrane, and communicating with the middle meatus of the nose. Its orifice is considerably diminished by con- tiguous bones, viz., by the uncinate process of the ethmoid, the inferior turbinated bone, and the palate bone. THE PALATE BONE. The palate bone forms the back part of the hard palate, and the lateral wall of the nose between the superior maxillary bone and the internal pterygoid process. It consists of a horizontal and a vertical plate united at a right angle, and of three processes, viz., the (A. T.) I.

The palate bone articulates with its fellow, and with the superior maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid, vomer, and inferior turbinated bone. The horizontal or yalate plate presents pos- teriorly a thin free border, forming the limit of the hard palate, and VOL. I, E

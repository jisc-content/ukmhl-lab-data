488 THE AXILLARY YEIN. and hand, are each accompanied by two veins, named vense coniites. These companion veins lie one on each side of the corresponding artery, and are connected v/iih each other at intervals by short cross branches, which in some places closely snrround the artery. Their distribution so nearly corresponds with that of the arteries, that they need not be more particulary described. The brachial veins, or companion veins of the brachial artery, terminate at the lower margin of the subscapularis muscle by joining the axillary vein ; not unfrequently, however, one of them will be found to come forward and unite with the basilic, which soon after becomes continuous with the axillary vein. Between the several veins of the upper limb numerous communica- tions exist in their whole course. Thus, those which lie beneath tiie integument are connected to each other by branches in the hand and forearm. Not only are the veins in each pair of venae comites united by short transverse vessels crossing the artery which they accompany, but also those attending different arteries have frequent connections with each other. Lastly, the subcutaneous and the deep veins commu- nicate freely, especially in the neighbourhood of joints. This general anastomosis ensures the continuance of the circulation during muscular action in the frequent and varied motions of the limb. AXILLABY VEIN. The axillary vein collects all the blood returning from the upper limb : its size is very considerable, and it is the highest of the veins of the Fig 312. Fig. 312.—View of a?HE Blood-vessels op the Right Axilla and Arm from the INNER SIDE (from R. Quain), ^ The detailed description of this figure will be found at p. 399. The following numbers indicate the principal veins :—2, the axillary vein ; 3, basilic vein ; 3', median basilic ; 4, 4', cephalic vein joining the acromial thoracic and axillary ; 6, alar-thoracic and subscapular ; 7, one of the,brachial veins.

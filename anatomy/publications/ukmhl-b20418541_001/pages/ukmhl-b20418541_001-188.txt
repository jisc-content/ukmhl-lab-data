168 ARTICULATIONS OF THE LOWEH LIMB. the tibia. Between the tibia and the ligament, near its insertion, is placed a synovial bursa. If the patella be considered a sesamoid bone, this ligament may be regarded as part of the tendon of the rectus femoris muscle. The crucial ligaments, placed in the centre of the joint, pass from the sides of the intercondylar fossa to the spaces in front of and behind the spine of the tibia. They decussate somewhat like the lines of the letter X. The anterior or external ligament is fixed by its lower Fig. [150, A.—The Knee-Joint, opened from before, to show the Crucial Liga- ments AND Semilunar Cartilages. (A. T.)

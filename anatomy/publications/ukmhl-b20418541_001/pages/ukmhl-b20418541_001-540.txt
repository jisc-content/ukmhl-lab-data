520 THE CEANIAL NERYES. The arrangement of Soemmerring is on the whole the preferable one ; bnt as the plan of Willis has long been in general use, it cannot be entirely abandoned. Connection with the encephalon.—The roots of the cranial nerves may be traced for some depth into the substance of the encephalon, a circumstance which has led to the distinction of the deep and the S'uper- ficial origin, by which latter is understood the place at which the nerve appears to be attached to the surface of the encephalon. Yi<y. 328. Fig. 328. — View from BELOW OF THE CuKNEC- TION OF THE PllINOirAL Nerves with the Brain. (A. T.) The full description of this figure will be found at p. 534 of vol. ii. The following references apply to the roots of the nerves ; I', the right olfactory tract divided near its middle; II, the left optic nerve springing from the com- missure Avhich is con- cealed by the pituitary body ; 11', the right optic tract ; the left tract is seen passing back into i and e, the internal and external corpora genicu- lata; III, the left oculo- motor nerve ; IV, the trochlear ; V, V, the large roots of the tri- facial nerves ; + +, the lesser roots, the + of the right side is placed on the Gfasserian ganglion ; 1, the ophthalmic; 2, the superior maxillary, and 3, the inferior maxillary nerves; VI, the left ab- ducent nerve; VII, a, h, the facial and auditory nerves; a, VIII, h, the glosso-pharyngeal, pneu- mo-gastric, and spinal ac- cessory nerves; IX, the right hypoglossal nerve ; at 0, on the left side, the rootlets are seen cut short; C I, the left sub- occipital or first cervical The superficial origin of these nerves is quite obvious. The first pair are attached to the under surface of the frontal lobes, the second to the posterior portion of the optic tlialami, the third to the crura cerebri, the fourth to the valve of Vieussens, the fifth to the sides of the pons, and the rem^ainder to the medulla oblongata.

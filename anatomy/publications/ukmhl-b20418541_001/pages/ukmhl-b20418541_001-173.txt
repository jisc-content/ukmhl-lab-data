It is attached superiorly to the external condylar eminence of the humerus, and inferiorly becomes blended with the annular ligament of the Fig. 140. radius, some of its hinder fibres being prolonged to the external margin of the ulna. Fig. 140.—Vertical Antero-Posterior Section of the Elbow-Joint through the Greater Sigmoid Cavity OF the Ulna and corresponding Trochlear surface OP THE Humerus. (A. T,) ^ 1, cut surface of the humerus ; 2, that of the ulna ; 3, posterior part, and 4, anterior part of the synovial cavity of the joint ; 5, orbicular ligament enclosing the head of the radius ; 6, tendon of the biceps muscle at its insertion into the tuberosity ; 7, is at the lower end of the round ligament. The anterior ligament consists of a thin sheet of fibres, strongest in its middle part, extending downwards from above the coronoid pit of the humerus to the coronoid process of the ulna and the orbicular ligament. The posterior ligament is comparatively thin and weak, and consists of loose and irregular fibres passing tranversely across the olecranon fossa of the humerus, and from the sides of that fossa to the

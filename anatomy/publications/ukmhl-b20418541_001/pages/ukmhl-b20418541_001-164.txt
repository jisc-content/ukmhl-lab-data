lU AETICULATIONS OF THE HEAD. TEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATION. The lower jaw articulates by its condyle on each side with the smooth surface of the temporal bone, extending over the part of the glenoid Fig. 130. The external lateral ligament attached aboye to the external surface and the tubercle of the zygoma ; Fig. 130. A PORTION OF THE Skull with the Lower Jaw AND Hyoid Bone, seen from the right and outer side. (A. T., after Arnold.) i 1, the external lateral ligament; 2, a part of the capsule of the joint; 3, styloid process ; 4, stylo- maxillai-y ligament; 5, stylo-hyoid ligament; 6, lesser cornu of the hyoid bone with some short liga- ments attaching it to the body and great cornu ; 7, the body ; 8, the great cornu. fossa in front of th6 Glaser- ian fissure and the anterior root of the zygoma. The joint is divided by an in- terarticular fibro-cartilage into an upper and a lower synovial cavity, is a short fasciculus of fibres^ Fig. 131.

Thin and short additional ligamentous fibres cover the syno- vial membrane in front and on the inside, forming an irregular cap- sule round the joint. The internal lateral ligament, thin, loose, and elongated, lies at some distance from the joint. It extends from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone downwards and a little forwards, to be attached to the inner border of the inferior dental foramen. Between it and the lower jaw are placed the external pterygoid muscle, the internal max- illary artery, and the inferior dental nerve. It has no immediate

The constricted passage between the anterior pillars, leading from the mouth to the pharynx, is called the istJimus of the Fig. 213.â€”Diagrammatic View of the Muscles of the Pharynx, &c, , from behind. (A.

The palato-glossus muscle, or constrictor isthnii faucium, occupies the anterior pillar of the fauces. Superiorly it is anterior to all the other muscles of the velum, and its fibres are continuous with those of its fellow of the opposite side ; inferiorly, it is lost on the side of the tongue. The palato-pharyngeus muscle, occupying the posterior pillar of the pharynx, arises in the soft palate by fii3res connected wdih those of the opposite side, and passing partly above and partly below the levator palati and azygos muscles. As the muscle descends it becomes greatly expanded, and its fibres are found extended from the posterior cornu of the thyroid cartilage, back to the middle line of the pharynx posteriorly. The azygos uvulae muscle (Morgagni), so called from having been supposed to be a single muscle, consists of two slips, which arise, one on each side of the middle line, from the tendinous structure of the soft palate, and, sometimes, from the spine of the palate plate, and descend into the uvula. The two slips are separated by a slight interval above, and unite as they descend. The levator palati muscle arises from the extremity of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, in front of the orifice of the carotid canal, and from the cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube. Ap- proaching the middle line as it passes downwards and forwards, it is inserted aponeurotically into the posterior part of the soft palate, and VOL. I. TJ

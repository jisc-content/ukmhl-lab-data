BONES OF THE HEAD. Fig. 55.—Vertical Antero- Fig. 55. 66 The external wall is the most extensive. The bones which take part in its formation are the nasal, superior maxillary, ethmoid, inferior spongy, and palate bones, and the internal pterygoid plates. The superior and inferior turbinated parts of the ethmoid bone (ethmo- turbinal bone), and the inferior spongy bone (maxillo-turbinal), project- posterior Section op a Part OF THE Cranium, showing THE Outer Wall op the Left Nasal Fossa, &c.

The superior meatus, very short, is placed between the superior and inferior turbinated parts of the ethmoid bone ; into it open anteriorly the posterior ethmoidal cells, and posteriorly the spheno-palatine fora- men and sphenoidal sinus. The middle meatus, the space between the inferior turbinated part of the ethmoid and the inferior spongy bone, communicates at its fore part by means of the infundibulum, with the anterior ethmoidal cells, and with the frontal sinus, while in its middle is the opening of the maxillary sinus. The inferior meatus, longer than the others, lies between the inferior spongy bone and the floor of the nasal cavity ; in its fore part is the orifice of the nasal duct and the anterior palatine canal. The air sinuses are hollows within the ethmoid, frontal, sphenoid, and maxillary bones, which communicate with the nasal cavities by narrow orifices. With the exception of the maxillary sinus these cavities are absent in early youth. The maxillary sinus begins to be formed about the fourth month of foetal life ; the frontal, ethmoidal, and. sphenoidal first appear during childhood, but remain of small size up to the time of puberty, when they undergo a great enlargement. In advanced life they all increase in size by absorption of the cancellated

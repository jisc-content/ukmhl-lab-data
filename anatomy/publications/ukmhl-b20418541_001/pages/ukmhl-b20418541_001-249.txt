229 GLUTEAL MUSCLES. placed two or three synovial bursa3, or a single multiloeular bursa of large size, A bursa is also situated between the muscle and the tendon of the vastus externus, and another separates it from the tuber ischii. The great size of the gluteus maximus and the consequent prominence of the buttock, is a characteristic of man as compared with those animals which most nearly approach him in general structure. Varlrtirx.—This muscle varies chiefly in the extent of its origin ; it may obtain a high fascial slip from the lumbar aponeurosis, or it may be attached only to the last two sacral vertebrae. It may also be considerably subdivided. Thus it has been seen wholly or partly bilaminar (Tiedemann, Macalister) ; or with a separate muscle, constituting in animals the agitator cauda3 attached to the coccyx and lowest part of the sacrum (Macalister). The gluteus medius muscle, covered partly by the gluteus maximus, ]-)artly by the fascia lata, arises from the surface of the dorsum ilii above the superior curved line, and in front of the gluteus maximus, from the strong fibres of the fascia lata, covering its outer surface. The muscular fibres converge as they descend, the anterior fibres passing obliquely backwards, the posterior fibres obliquely forwards, and terminate in a fan-shaped tendon, which is inserted into an oblique line directed doAvnwards and forwards on the outer surface of the great trochanter. The tendon is separated by a small bursa from the upper part of the trochanter. Bdationx.—Between this muscle and the gluteus minimus are the gluteal nerve and deep branches of the gluteal artery. At its anterior and inferior border its fibres are parallel to and united with those of the gluteus minimus. This border also is in contact with the tensor vaginas femoris. The posterior border is in contact with the pyriformis, being separated by the gluteal vessels and nerves. Yar'ietien.—The gluteus medius has been found bilaminar by Henle. It may be united posteriorly by a tendinous slip to the tendon of the pyi-if ormis, or the two tendons may be separated by a bursa (the bursa of Loder). This last condition occm-s once in every fifteen subjects (Macalister). Fig. 185.—Deep Muscles of the Hip on Fig. IS."

The gluteus minimus, covered by the preceding muscle, arises from the whole space on the dorsum ilii between the superior and inferior curved lines.

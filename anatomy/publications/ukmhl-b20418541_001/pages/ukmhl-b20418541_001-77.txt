THE SUTURES. 57 malar to the occipital bone, bounded by the frontal and parietal bones above, and the malar, sphenoid, and temporal bones below. The fronto-parietal, or coronal suture, connects the frontal and the two parietal bones. It commences at each side, about an inch behind the external orbital process of the frontal bone, above the great wing of the sphenoid, and mounts upwards and backwards to the vertex. It presents the most marked dentations in the middle of each lateral half; at the summit the serrated surface is oblique, the frontal bone overlapping the parietal, while similarly at the lower part the parietal overlaps the frontal. The occ'ipito-jMrietal, or lamldoidal suture, between the occipital and parietal bone, inclines downwards and outwards on each side and has somewhat of the form of the Greek letter A. The occijoito-mastoid suture is in continuation with it. Fig. 50. Fig. 50.â€”Lateral View op the Skull represented in Figure 49. (A.

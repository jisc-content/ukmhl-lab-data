DORSAL MUSCLES OF THE TRUXK. 302 Fig. 217.â€”View of the DEEP Muscles of the Back, showing their I Attachments to the Vertebral Column and EiBS. (A. T.) i On the left side the seve- ral parts of the erector spi- nte are nearly in their na- tural position, with the exception of the spinalis dorsi, which is drawn out laterally from the spines of the vertebrce ; on the right side the spinalis dorsi has been entirely removed, the ilio-costalis drawn to the outer side so as to expose its accessory muscle, and the longissimus removed, excepting small portions at its insertions. Superiorly on the left side, the trache- lomastoid and complexas are left nearly in their natural positions ; while, on the right side, the trachelo-mastoid has been entirely removed, and the complexus, separated from its occipital attachment, has been spread out so as to stretch its vertebral attachments, a, occipital protuberance ; h, mastoid j)rocess ; c, bifid spinous process of the axis ver- tebra ; I, spinous process of the first dorsal vertebra and first rib ; VI, six;tii dorsal spine and trans- verse process and sixth rib ; XII, tAvelfth dorsal spine and twelfth rib. On the left side of the figure, 1, com- plexus muscle; 2, trachelo- mastoid ; 3, serratus pos- ticus superior, detached from the vertebral column and drawn upwards from the ribs ; 4, 4, the slips of attachment of the serratus posticus inferior to the four lower ribs ; 5, three slips of origin of the latis- simus dorsi from the lower ribs ; 5', iliac origin of the same muscle ; 6 +, common origin of the lon- gissimus dorsi and ilio-cos- talis from the ilium and sacrum, &c. ; 6, upper part of the longissimus dorsi ; 6', transversalis cervicis continued up from the Ion-

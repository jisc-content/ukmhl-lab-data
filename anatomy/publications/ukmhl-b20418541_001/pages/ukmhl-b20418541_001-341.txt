The inter- sections do not usually penetrate the whole thickness of the mus- cle, but are confined chiefly to its anterior fibres, and are firmly united to the anterior wall of the sheatli of the muscle, while the posterior surface of the muscle has no attachment to the sheath. The linea3 transversa have been regarded as indications of the abdominal ribs VOL. I. r

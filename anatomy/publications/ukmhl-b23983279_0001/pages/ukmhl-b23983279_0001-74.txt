ANATOMY OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. 66 consist of young endothelial cells, but the endothelial cells so pro- liferating arrange themselves into a cord, which stretches freely over the surface. In the exudation we find a great number of cells, which, on account of their size, their granulation, and their nucleus, are very sharply distinguished from the small pale blood or lymph-corpuscles. In consideration of what we have said above, it will, I think, not meet any opposition if we consider those corpuscles, reminding one of endothelial cells, which occur in the exudation, as the products of the endothelium. Besides, there can be no mistake that also a large number of cells which are to be found in the exudation, rather smaller, more or less pale, originate by the division of the former, for there may be observed on the warm stage amoeboid movements and division in those larger cells furnished with constricted or double nucleus. There are intermediate stages between the forms first cited and that of acute peritonitis of more moderate degree, just as there is a complete gradation between acute peritonitis of the severest degree and of the mildest; and this depends, as is known, upon the intensity and extent of the irritation employed, upon the animal itself, and upon circumstances which we cannot enter upon in detail in this place, as they lie quite without the boundaries of this description. What we wish to show is the variety^ which exists in respect of the changes of the endothelium that occur when we have to do with a very intense acute peritonitis, viz. intense hypersemia, abundant emigration of colourless blood corpuscles, and abundant thin exu- dation fluid ; or with slight acute peritonitis, viz. slight hyperaemia, generally limited to the omentum, peritoneum of the centrum tendi- neum and intestinal covering, and no marked emigration of colour- less blood corpuscles. For in the latter case it may be observed that a lively germination of the endothelial cells takes place, limited chiefly to those places where a germination could be made out already under normal circumstances, namely, on the centrum ten- dineum around the stomata over the lymphatic capillaries of the peritoneal surface, on the lymphangial knots and cords of the omentum and of the mesentery, where we have met with pseudo-stomata and ^rue stomata in numbers, and, lastly, on the fenestrated parts of

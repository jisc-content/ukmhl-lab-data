EXPLANATION OF PLATES. 86 Fig. 11. Silver preparation of the peritoneal surface of the centrum ten- din eum of the diaphragm of rabbit, as in Fig. 7. M. p. III. 5. t. Endothelium which covers the serosa over the tendon- bundles. . 8. Stomata over the straight lymphatic vessels, some of them open, some collapsed; the surrounding endothelium of a germinating character. Fig. 12. Silver preparation from the same mesentery as Fig. 9. M. p. in. 5. a. Stomata, the surrounding endothelium c of which, as well as of lymphatic sinuses h, is intensively germinating. h. The endothelium of lymphatic sinuses, the stomata of which are widely open, so that the endothelium of their bottom can be seen. d. Common flat endothelium of the general surface. Fig. 13. Silver preparation of the fenestrated portion of omentum of guinea-pig suflFering from chronic peritonitis. M. p. III. 7. a. Thin trabeculaa covered with common flat endothelium. h. Abundant germination of endothelium, springing oflf from the surface of a larger trabecula c, and continuing on the smaller secondary trabeculee. •■ PLATE IV. Fig. ] 4. Silver preparation of the pencilled pleural surface of the centrum tendineum of a guinea-pig suflFering from slight chronic inflammation of the serous membranes. M. p. III. 7. a. The endothelium of lymphatic-capillaries, c. The lymph-canalicular system of the pleural-serosa; the branched cells, which occupy that 1. c. system, are in some places distinctly to be seen. At h, these cells (respectively the lacunae of the 1. c. system) have becorue more numerous by division. At d, the continuation of the endothelium of the lymphatic ca- pillaries with the cells of the 1. c. system is clearly to be seen.

30 ANATOMY OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. appears imder the endothelium of the general surface a second layer of large flat cells, arranged very similarly to an endothelium. The cells consist of an almost hyaline substance, and possess a large clear ovoid nucleus : the cells which lie deeper in the proper substance of the serosa are more or less flat and branched. In preparations which have been stained with nitrate of silver after being pencilled from the pleural sm-face, the branched cells of the serosa are not easily recog- nisable, the lymph-canalicular system of the branched cells being the chief thing that comes into view; but by using a high power and examining a preparation which has been deeply stained in many places, one is able to distinguish the bodies as well as the processes of the branched cells, the former occupying the lacimge, the latter the canaliculi of the lymph-canalicular system. The cell substance is very pale, distiactly granular round the oblong or spherical sharp outlined nucleus. The cells of the islands of the serosa, which are surrounded by lymphatic vessels (see the following chapter), are very instructive as regards the processes of division of the branched cells of the lymph- canalicular system we have already mentioned in a former place. One finds in the central parts, as well as in the peripheral parts of those islands, numerous places where the branched cells lie in groups, as if round a common centre or in chains : tliere the individual cells are very little or not at all branched where they touch each other, whereas they are provided with processes on their outer sides. These cells of the serosa come out very distinctly when the serosa has been slightly afiected by inflammation. Under those circumstances their relation towards each other and the surrounding parts is much more distinct. We call the attention of the reader to the figures 14, 16, 17, which will render our meaning easier to understand than any long descrip- tion.

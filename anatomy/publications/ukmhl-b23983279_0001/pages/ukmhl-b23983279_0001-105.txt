EXPLANATION OF PLATES. 97 processes which project from the reticulated-branched cells of the matrix up to the free surface between the endotheUum of the latter (Pseudo-stomata). c. Branched cells of the reticulum, which form, so to speak, the matrix of the chord. d. Lymph-corpuscles occupying the meshes of the reticulum. Fio. 52. From a fresh mesogastrium of rana temporaria. M. p. III. 8. A. A knob freely projecting over the surface of the membrane, con- sisting of a clear matrix, in which some granular cellular ele- ments are to be seen ; the knob is covered with an endotheHum c, which is not so flat as the endotheHum in general. a. The root of the knob. With the endothelial covering of this knob there are in direct continuity four cells, which spring from a common protoplasmic peduncle by means of long thia protoplasmic filaments. The cells h have shown for a considerable length of time active amoeboid movements. The cell d was also in continuity with the endotheh'um a of a fold of the membrane. There cannot be any doubt that these cells are endothehal cells, and consequently that they are in a state where they are already amcsboid cells (lymph corpuscles), although they have not yet perfectly separated from the endothehal matrix.

Vesicles of the tissues, the interior of which is Hned with ciUjB; the wall consists of a nucleated protoplasm; each of these vesicles develops from one ceU of the tissue by vacnolation; in 3, three granular cells are to be seen two of which are provided with cili^. These conld 'only have been brought into the cavity of the vesicles from outside, because some of the germinating endothelial cells of the surface are provided with cilifie. In 4 the summit of such a vesicle is adjusted, which shows a stoma; so that the interior of the vesicle communicates with the free surface of the mesogastrium. This stoma is H

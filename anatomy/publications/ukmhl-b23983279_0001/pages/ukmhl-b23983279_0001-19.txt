11 CHAPTEE II. THE CELLULAR ELEMENTS OF THE GROUND-SUBSTANCE. The following description of the cellular elements will be incomplete, as they wiU be considered in many ways in the chapter on lymphatic and blood-vessels. The most instructive and simple object for the investigation of the cellular elements of the ground-substance is the omentmn. of rabbits, this being flatter, and, for the most part, very slightly fenestrated compared with that of the guinea-pig, dog, cat, and monkey. If one compares the omenta of various rabbits, one fi.nds, on mi- croscopical observation, some not immaterial differences. One finds, namely, a great niunber of omenta of full-grown animals in which there are richly distributed opaque tracts of different breadth, forming a network: some of these tracts consist of a row of patches of different size, mostly oblong, sometimes roundish, which coalesce with each other more or less. There are niunerous patches which are situated laterally to these tracts, as well as perfectly isolated ones. Seen under a lens, the tracts generally follow the course of the larger blood-vessels. In yoimg animals the network of opaque tracts is less developed than the isolated patches. But also, on the same omentima, there exists a difference between different parts ; while that part of the omentum which lies upon the anterior wall of the stomach, viz. between the large and small curvature, contains very abundantly isolated patches up to such a size that they are hardly visible to the naked eye, we find on those portions which He along the great curvatm-e and upon the pylorus, besides these, also large tracts of fused patches. It may be said in general, the younger the animal the more isolated small patches are to l)e met with ; the older the animal the larger they are, and the more confluent to tracts. It must not be understood, however,

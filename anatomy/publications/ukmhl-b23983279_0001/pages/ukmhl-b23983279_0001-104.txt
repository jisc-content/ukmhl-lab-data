EXPLANATION OF PLATES. 96 PLATE X. Fig. 49. From a pencilled silver-stained mesentery of frog; slight chronic peritonitis, M. p. III. 7. a. vSmall blood-vessels, showing distinctly their endothelium. h. Lymphatic vessels, showing their endothelial wall; the lumen of the vessels contains numerous colourless cor- puscles c. At d, and towards the left side of the preparation, a lymphatic vessel is seen to be in continuity with the lymph-canalicular system of the ground-substance, in which system also numerous colourless corpuscles are to be found. To the left-hand side of the preparation, where the drawing is taken from, an abundant emigration of colourless blood-corpuscles can be seen to have taken place from the appearance in which the blood-vessels and the surrounding tissue is found: these colourless corpuscles are seen to pass through the lymph- canalicular system into the lymphatic vessels towards the right-hand side. /. Ground-substance, not represented. Feg. 50. From the same omentum as Fig. 43. M. p. III. 7. a. Vein. h. Artery. c. Capillaries. d. A lymphatic vessel, in which this whole system of blood- vessels is invaginated. e. Reticulum of nucleated branched cells growing from the eo- dothelial wall of the lymphatic vessel into the cavity of the vessel. Fig. 51. From a fresh preparation of oedematous pleura mediastini of cat, representing a lymphatic cord in profile. M. p. III. 7. a. Germinating endothelium of the surface of the cords. h. Nucleated buds which arc direct offsprings of the reticulum of the matrix. There are seen numbers of such protoplasmic

ANATOMY OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. 2 of Eecklinghausen ; and 3. The free communication between the lymphatic vessels and the serous cavity by means of stomata. The following description refers to the minute structure of the omentum, the centriun tendineum of the diaphragm and the pleui-a mediastini. In dealing with these membranes we shall be able, besides other important facts, to instruct ourselves about the three questions above mentioned. In this Section I. we shall treat separately (1) of the endothelium of the free surface, (2) of the cellular elements of the ground-sub- stance, (3) of the lymphatic vessels, their distribution and relation to the tissue and the surface, as well as their development, and (4) of the blood-vessels.

EXPLANATION OF PLATES. 89 Fig. 24. From a silver-stained preparation of normal omentum of rabbit, representing a vascular patch, the ground-substance of whicli F has remained unstained by the silver, whereas the very rich net- work of the branched cells e have become very distinct. M. p. III. 7. a. Capillary blood-vessels. /). Growing capillaries; the growth takes place by hollowing of the branched cells which are in connection with the wall of the capillary vessels d. c. Yacuolation in the branched cells, as the first step of becoming hollowed out and afterwards to become continuous with the lumen of a capillary vessel. Fig. 25. From a silver-stained preparation of the mesentery of a monkey suifering from chronic peritonitis. , M. p. II. 7. F. Ground-substance not represented. a. Different stages of vacuolation of apparently not branched cells of the matrix. Such vacuolated cells becoming united from tubes, the wall of which becomes differentiated in en- dothelial plates a. 1). Small, c larger nucleated elements of the matrix. Fig. 26. From a silver-stained preparation of the omentum of a guinea- pig, as in Fig. 23, representing a villus which projects freely over the surface. Optical longitudinal section. M. p. III. 10 a I'immersion. a. Ground substance of the villus, consisting of finely fibrillated connective tissue, containing large granular spindle-shaped looking cells, which in many places, c, are projecting between the enlarged and germinating endothelium b and c freely up to the surfaceâ€”^Pseudo-stomata; from them also young cells grow up, d. Fig. 27. From a silver-stained preparation of the centrum tendineum of a guinea-pig as in Fig. 22. Pleural surface. M. p. 111. 5. a. Common endothelium of the general surface; below it a vacuolated cell, which forms a stoma verum with the surface.

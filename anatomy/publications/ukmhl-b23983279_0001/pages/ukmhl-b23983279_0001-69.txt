61 BLOOD-VESSELS OF THE SEROUS MEMBRANES. The principle according to which the formation of capillaries takes place is similar to that which was first pointed out by Strieker in the new formation of blood-vessels in the tadpole and in inflammation, and which was afterwards confirmed in every detail by Arnold. But we must here remark that in our lymphangial nodides, patches, and cords, the new formation of blood-capillaries does not take place by the sending forth of protoplasmic buds from the wall of a capillary, which are then excavated, starting from the vessel; but this excava- tion goes on both from the already formed vessel, and also isolated in the branched lymph-canalicular cells, which are in direct con- tinuity with the endothelium of the blood-vessels. Precisely the same mode of development may be shown in the previously-mentioned gelatinous body of the infra-orbital fossa. Here a number of places may be found in the neighbourhood of the fat- body where there is as yet no formation of fat in the groups of branched cells, and where, nevertheless, an active development of capillaries is going on. From place to place we find such accumula- tions of branched cells and young capillaries, in which, on the one hand, the direct connection of the former with the wall of the latter may be easily seen, and, on the other hand, the excavation of already formed capillaries into those cells as well as the isolated vacuolation of the branched cells may be followed through all stages. It seems, from what has been said of this hyaline body, and of the development of fat-tissue in the omentum and the mesentery, to be the general rule, that the transformation of the branched cells of those cords and nodules into fat cells is preceded by the development of a correspond- ing system of capillary blood-vessels.

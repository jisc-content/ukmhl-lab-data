87 EXPLANATION OF PLATES. Fig. 15. From a preparation similar to that shown in Fig. 14 ; there was a little more inflammation in the serous membranes, M. p. nr. 7. (Tube half drawn out). a. Endothelium of lymphatic capillaries. J. The same somewhat altered. c. Continuation between it and the cells of the lymph-canali- cular system. Fig. 16. A preparation similar to that shown in Fig. 14. M. p. III. 7. a, &, and c as in Fig. 14. Fig. 17. Silver preparation of the pencilled pleural-surface of the normal centrum tendineum of rabbit. M. p. III. 7. I. Endothelium of lymphatic capillaries, c. Lymph-canalicular system of the serosa. s. The same, in which only the nuclei of the branched cells are to be seen. At t, continuation of the endothelium of the lymphatic vessels â– with the lymph-canalicular system, or, properly speaking, with their branched cells. FiQ. 18. From a silver-stained preparation of the mesogastrium of a frog, representing a node projecting freely from the surface of a large trabecula t. M. p. III. 8. a. CiHated endothelium which covers the surface of that node. J. A vacuolated cell of the matrix of the node ; fine cilise are projecting into the vacuole. c. A vacuolated cell, the wall of which has already differentiated in individual endothelial plates. d. A vacaolated cell filled with nucleated young cells. Fig. 19. From a silver preparation of a pencilled mesentery of ape suf- fering from chronic peritonitis. M. p. III. 8. M. Connective-tissue matrix not represented, a. The lymph-canalicular system, with its corresponding branched cells. h. Large migratory cells which lie in that 1, c. system beside the branched cells.

91 EXPLANATION OF PLATES. a. Pedunculus of the sprout. b. Summit of it. The endothelium which covers this sprout, especially that of the summit, is of a germinating character. c. A vacuolated cell of the matrix. d. Young cells of the matrix. "Fig. 32. From a pencilled portion of the mesentery of the same monkey as Fig. 31. M. p. IV. 8. a. Migratory cells not yet perfectly detached from the nucleated branched cells, which lie in the lymph-canalicular system b. e. The nuclei of those branched cells. There are numbers of small elements and particles in the lymph-canalicular system to be seen, which owe their origin probably to the nuclei of the branched cells as well as to the migratory cells. F. Matrix unstained. Fig. 33. From the silver-stained mesentery of the same monkey. M. p. II. 7. In A a vacuolated cell is to be seen which lies below the endothelium of the surface : its wall has already become differentiated into endo- thelial plates a, and at the same time its cavity has opened, so as to communicate with the free surface of the mesentery by a stoma verum b. In B a sprout is to be seen, which projects between the endothelium of the general surface a freely outwards : it stands in communication with the tissue below the endothelium of the surface by means of a protoplasmic pedunculus c ; its body is formed by a vacuolated cell b, which in fact represents only the cell of a pseudo-stoma. Fig. 34. From a pencilled silver-stained preparation of normal omentum of rabbit. M. p. III. 7. a. Lymphatic-capillary vessel, showing the endothelial markings of its walls. b. An artery. c. Capillary blood-vessels; and d, branched cells of a surrounding patch. e. A place where the endothelium of the lymphatic vessel becomes continuous with those branched cells. f. Migratory cells.

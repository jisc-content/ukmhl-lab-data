62 ANATOMY OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. Section U.—PATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS. Much less attention has been paid to the study of the serous mem- branes in pathological respects. As regards the changes which the endothelium of the surface undergoes under morbid conditions, we meet with the assertions of Eindfleisch, Eanvier and Kundrat. The two last authors confirm the germination of the endothelium in inflammation of the serous membranes. The process of germination is, according to them, exactly the same as it occurs otherwise, and as we had occasion to see in the normal state; the cells increase in size, become more polyhedral, the nuclei are observed to divide, and then the cells themselves. According to Kundrat the miliary nodules on the serous membrane in tuberculosis are derived from germinating endothelium. According to Sanderson there is a pr§-existing adenoid tissue in the omentum in the form of nodules and cords, which increases to an extraordinary extent in chronic inflammation, so that the nodules and cords of tubercle which occur in artificial tuberculosis are nothing but hyperplastic adenoid tissue. According to. Knaufi" smaU knots and cords are present even under normal conditions, consisting of a collec- tion of lymphoid elements. These small knots play the most impor- tant part in tuberculosis; it is these that grow and multiply, and represent the miliary tubercles. Finally, in respect of the lymphatic vessels, Klebs has declared that the lymphatic vessels play an important part in artificial tuberculosis; since the endotheliima of the lymphatic vessels proliferates; the yoimg cells originating thus compose the tubercle-knot. We have already had an opportimity of pointing out in the first chapter, that on the serous membranes in certain regions, there is

EXPLANATION OF PLATES. I have to offer my sincere thanks to the Government Grant Com- mittee of the Royal Society for having furnished the means for the execution of the following plates :— PLATE I. Fig. 1. Germinating Endothelium of tracts freely projecting over the surface of the pleura mediastini of a healthy cat. Preparation stained with nitrate of silver. M. p. Hastnark, E. p. No. III. Obj. 7. Fig. 2. Surface of a mesentery of frog, stained with nitrate of silver. M. p. E. p. III. Obj. 5. a. Common flat endothelial cells of the surface, amongst which six couples of cells are to be found, which have stained deeply with the reagent, and which consist of a granular protoplasm ; these cells are not flat, but more or less polyhedral—germinating or young endothelial cells. Between the cells of these couples more or less distinct openings are to be seen—stomata vera, which lead into a lymphatic space below; they are exactly like the stomata of the epidermis of plants. Fig. 3. Silver-stained preparation of the septum cysternte lymphaticse- magnse of frog. M. p. III. Obj. 5. A. Peritoneal surface of that membrane. B. The surface directed towards the cystoma shows amongst the common flat endothelial cells, the size and shape of which are obviously diff'erent on the two surfaces, openings of canals, by which that septum is penetrated. The openings, viz. the canals are lined with a special layer of polyhedral cells, which have the character of young germinating endothelial cells. « 2

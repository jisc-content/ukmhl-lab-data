ANATOMY OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. I. THE SEEOUS MEMBEANES/ Section I.â€”THE NORMAL CONDITIONS. Since the important discovery of injecting the lymphatic vessels of the diaphragm from the peritoneal cavity by Eecklinghausen, and since this author has shown that the serous cavities represent great lymphatic sacs, the serous membranes have become a favourite object of study. A long series of excellent researches has 'highly amplified our knowledge of the normal and pathological histology of the serous membranes in a relatively short time. The staining with solution of nitrate of silver, first employed by Eecklinghausen, plays a great part in this advance. As regards the normal conditions, the attention of histologists has been chiefly if not wholly direpted to three questions : 1. The distri- bution of the lymphatic vessels in the serous membranes ; 2. The origin of the lymphatic capillaries from the lymph-canalicular system ' The results of the observations I intend tq describe in this memoir have been partly published by Dr. Burdon-Sanderson E^nd myself, as a preliminary publication, in the Centralblatt fur mcdisin. Wisscnsch. 1872, January 2, 3, and 4. Since that time I have made a series of observations, which in many respects complete those there de- scribed, in such a way that the anatomy of the serous membrane, in so far as it refers to the lymphatic system, may be regarded as complete. I shall have, many times, occasion to restate what has been already put down in that preliminary publication, together with observations of a later date. These researches were undertaken at the request of Dr. Biirdon-Sanderson in connec- tion with the Pathological Inquiries conducted by him for the Medical Department of the Privy Council. They are published with the sanction and approval of the medical officer of the Privy Council, Mr. Simon.

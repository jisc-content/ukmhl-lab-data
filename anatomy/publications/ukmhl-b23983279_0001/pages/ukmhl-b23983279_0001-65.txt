THE LYMPHATIC VESSELS OF THE SEROUS MEMBRANES. 57 relation to the development of lymphatic sinuses and capillaries; indeed, in a mesogastrium in which there is a sufficient number of such endothelial vesicles in different stages of development, their connection with lymphatic capillaries may be easily shown. I have also shown that in a later stage they lose their cilia. Finally, I have said that an endothelial vesicle may open freely on the surface, and that in that case a true stoma is formed. There is no difficulty in imderstanding this, if we remember what has been said about pseudo- stomata ; it is only necessary to imagine that if, for instance, a lymph- canalicular cell, one of whose processes projects freely on the surface, i.e. forms a pseudo-stoma, becomes converted by vacuolation into an endothelial vesicle, and the vacuole extends along the process forming the pseudo-stoma, the process must finally result in the formation of a true stoma. I may add here that I have observed such endothelial vesicles also in male frogs and in toads. "We shall see that the new formation of such true stomata takes place to a very great extent in chronic inflammation of the various serous membranes of mammals. According to what we know of the development of endothelial vesicles, we must express the view that they always ultimately become connected with lymphatic capillaries.

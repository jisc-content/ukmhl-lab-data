EXPLANATION OF PLATES. 98 FiO. 40. Silver preparation of a pencilled omentum of rabbit. M. p. II. 7. a. A vein filled with blood. b. Capillary blood-vessel. c. Lymphatic capillary vessels showing their endothelium; the blood-vessels are invaginated in these lymphatics. d. Branches of the lymphatic vessel, which are in communication with the lymph-canalicular system of the ground-substance e. f. The lymph-canaHcular system of a lymphatic patch, which system is also in communication with the lymphatic vessel at g. Fig. 41. Fresh preparation of an oedematous omentum of a guinea-pig suflPering from chronic peritonitis. M. p. III. 7. a. A lymphatic vessel. b. A portion of a peri-lymphangial nodule. c. The endothelial wall of the lymphatic vessel seen in profile. d. Blood capillaries of the nodule. e. Lymph corpuscles. It is seen that the reticulum of nucleated branched cells which forms the stroma of that nodule is in continuation with the endothelial wall of the lymphatic vessel. Fig. 42. Silver preparation of omentum of guinea-pig suflPering from chronic peritonitis. M. p. III. 7 The figure represents a large trabecula, which projects over the general surface like a fringe. a. A venous blood-vessel, its endothelium distinctly to be seen. d. Accumulation of lymph-corpuscles, probably in lymphatic \*essels which accompany the vein. b. An open stoma verum, surrounded by germinating endo- thelium ; the stoma leads into a lymphatic space, which, as far as it can be traced, shows its endothelial wall in profile; the lymphatic space is, except a few large lymph- corpuscles, filled with clear fluid; it is probable that the lymph-corpuscles which project to the right and left side of this lymphatic space lie in the continuation of it. c. A sprout of germinating endothelium, round a stoma, which

EXPLANATION OF PLATES. 85 witli endothelial cells, which, as in Fig. 6, are of a germina- ting character. d. Represent sinuses of those straight lymphatic vessels. Fia. 8. Peritoneal surface of a silver preparation of a centrum tendineum of a guinea-pig which suffered from chronic infect, peritonitis (artificial tuberculosis.) M. p. III. 7. a—a and —Indicate the straight lymphatic vessels between the tendon bundles, as in Fig. 7. b. Represent stomata which are plugged up by a substance which has become darkly stained by the reagent (fibrinous plug); the endothelium which surrounds the stomata is in a state of intensive germination, forming buds and villi, freely pro- jecting over the surface; on the latter ones cells are seen to be in the state of detaching themselves by constriction (lymphoid cells). Fia. 9. Silver preparation of the mesentery of guinea-pig in the same morbid condition as that of Fig. 8. M. p. III. 7.: a. Common endothelium of the surface. d. The upper wall of a lymphatic sinus, which has become freely exposed to the surface; the endothelial marking of that wall is clearly to be seen. I. Stomata, which lead obliquely into the cavity of the lymphatic sinus. c. Germinating endothelium round these stomata, forming buds, which project over the free surface. PLATE III. Fig. 10. Silver preparation of the omentum of a guinea-pig suffering from chronic infective inflammation. M. p. III. 7. a. The trabeculse of the fenestrated portion of the omentum, with its endothelial covering. b. Freely-projecting villi, the top of which is covered with c germinating endothelium.

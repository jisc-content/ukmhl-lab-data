3 CHAPTER I. THE ENDOTHELITJM OF THE FKEE SURFACE OF THE SEROUS MEMBRANES. A GENERAL description of the endothelium of the free surface of the serous membranes is hardly necessary after those given by Eeckling- hausen, Auerbach, Ludwig and Schweigger-Seidel, Dybkovsky and others. Some points only will be treated of in this chapter, which have not yet been sufficiently appreciated. The endothelium of the free surface is in the normal condition not everywhere a layer of flattened more or less hyaline cell-plates, but possesses in many places a different character, which may be described as follows: the individual cells are polyhedi-al, club-shaped, or even short columnar, their substance is distinctly granular, even in the fresh condition, their nucleus is for the most part, like that of the ordinary endothelial plates, ovodi, sometimes spherical, clear, sharp- outlined, with a large shining nucleolus. In many cells, however, the nucleus is marked by a constriction, or is even perfectly divided into two. A portion of the fenestrated part of the fresh omentum of a full- grown guinea-pig, cat, dog or monkey, mounted in an indifferent fluid, such as one^half per cent, saline solution, peritoneal fluid, etc., or after having been stained in one-quarter or one-half per cent, solution of nitrate of silver and mounted in glycerine, shows often enough on the surface of the thin trabeculse small groups of club-shaped or polj- hedral granular cells, projecting from the sm-face of the trabeculaa like buds. If one follows a large trabecula, which contains either large blood vessels only, or besides those, also tracts of fat-tissue, one can always find smaller or larger arese, generally on one surface only, the u a

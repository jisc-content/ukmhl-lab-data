94 EXPLANATION OF PLATES. IS plugged up by a darklj-stained subsfcanco (fibrin) ; it is probable that also here this Bfcoma leads to a lymphatic vessel, which is filled with lymph-corpuscles. /. EndotheHum of the general surface. e. Enlarged endothelium seen in profile at the edge of the fringe. Â° Pig. 43. Fresh preparation of the same omentum as Fig. 4]. M. p. III. 7. a. A venous capillary vessel, fiUed with blood. h. An invaginating lymphatic vessel. c. Outer endothelial wall. 6. Inner (covering the blood-vessel) endothelial wall of the lymphatic vessel. d. Endo-lymphangial reticulum, which is continuous with the endothelial wall of the lymphatic vessel. In this way endo- lymphangial nodules and tracts are formed. Fig. 44.^ From an oedematous omentum of a monkey suflTering from chronic peritonitis. M. p. III. 7. a. An artery h. A vein filled with blood (not fully represented). c. A lymphatic vessel in which both the veins and the artery are invaginated. Many of the^endotheHal cells of the wall of the lymphatic vessel are seen to be enlarged. d. Lymph-corpuscles which nearly have plugged up the lym- phatic vessel. PLATE IX. Fig. 45. A silver preparation of the centrum tendineum of a guinea-pig, suffering from chronic infective inflammation of the serous membranes. M. p. III. 5. Surface view of a portion of the peritoneal surface. a. The upper endothelial wall of a sacciform dilatation of a super- ficial straight lymphatic capillary vessel; the endothelium of the general surface of the serosa is somehow removed. h. Large open stomata vera.

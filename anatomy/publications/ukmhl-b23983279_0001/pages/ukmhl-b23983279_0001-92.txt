84 EXPLANATION OF PLATES. FiQ. 4. Silver-stained preparation of slightly cedematous mesentery of guinea-pig, suffering from chronic infective peritonitis. M. p. III. 5. a. The endothelium of the general surface ; below the endothe- lium close to the surface a large dilated lymphatic vessel c is to he seen, through which passes an artery d and a nerve trunk e (Invagination) ; the lymphatic vessel stands in free communication with free surface, viz. the peritoneal cavity, by a number of stomata vera, which are lined with young endothelium. FiQ. 5. Silver-stained preparation of the omentum majus of dog. M. p. III. 8. (Tube drawn in.) Shows amongst the flat endothelium of the surface small and large groups of germinating endothelium, between which numbers of small stomata are to be seen. PLATE II. Fig. 6. Silver-stained preparation of the omentum of rabbit. M. p. II. 7. (Tube half drawn out.) a. Common flat endothelium of the general surface. h. A tract projecting somewhat over the surface, covered with an endothelium, the cells of which are of smaller size; amongst these smaller or larger groups of small cells are to be seen, which are not flat but polyhedral, which consist of a distinctly granular protoplasm, and which are arranged more or less regularly round stomata. Fia. 7. Silver preparation of centrum tendineum of rabbit. Peritoneal surface. M. p. III. 7. a. Common flat endothelium of the peritoneal serosa, which covers the tendon-bundles. h. Smaller endothelium, which covers straight lymphatic vessels which lie between the tendon-bundles, c. Stomata vera, some widely open, some collapsed, which lead to those straight lymphatic vessels ; these stomata ai-e lined

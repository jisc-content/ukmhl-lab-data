ANATOMY 01' THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. 68 one side like a fold, we may convince ourselves, searching at the edge of this cord, that the germinating polyhedral, or even conical cells of the surface, are to be referred almost as abundantly to the pseudo-stomata as to the endothelium of the general surface. At least, I have often met with appearances, not only in these cords, but also on the small knots, where, in a given profile view, whether optical-profile or section-profile, a young endothelium cell of the surface alternated with an endothelial-like bud of a pseudo-stoma. This distinction in an optical-profile view, such as on a fold, is some- times combined with great difficidties. I myself considered all these young endothelial cells of the surface for a long time simply as the surface endothelium, until, by the frequency of pseudo-stomata on the lymphatic knots of the rabbit's omentum, and by the discovery that numerous young cells of the surface, quite resembling endothelial cells, stand in direct connection with the pseudo-stomata, I became aware of the inaccuracy of that view. I submitted, therefore, the young endothelium of the surface of these knots and cords to a subse- quent exact examination. I have accordingly studied this relation especially, first upon sections through the large knots and cords of the pleura of the cat, through the knots and cords of the tuberculous omentum of the guinea-pig, and have so discovered that, in the first place, the distribution of pseudo-stomata upon these lymphatic knots is a very extensive one, by far more extensive than I was at first inclined to accept, and secondly, that a great number of the young endothelial-looking cells are in continuity with the pseudo-stomata, that is, with the protoplasmic processes which usually represent the pseudo-stoma. Once acquainted with the fact itself, I came speedily into a position to confirm, under all conditions, the fact previously mentioned, that the proliferation affects not only the endothelium which surrounds a pseudo-stoma, but that the pseudo-stoma itself takes part in it. It is clear that there is no necessity to make a distinction between those young cells which originate from the super- ficial endothelium surrounding a pseudo-stoma, and those of the latter themselves, since there exists no morphological difference ; they are quite alike in their appearance, nucleus, form, and size;

88 EXPLANATION OF PLATES. Fio, 20. From tlie lumbar portion of the peritoneum parietale of a rabbit suifering from chronic peritonitis. M. p. III. 8. a. Enlarged branched cells of the ground-substance, provided with a vacuole c, in which lie fat globules d, and yonng (lymph) cells e. h. The nuclei of the branched cells. Fig. 21, From the mesentery of ape suffering from chronic peritonitis. M. p. III. 8. a. Enlarged branched cells of the ground-substance, filled with fat globules h. The ground-substance M is not represented. PLATE V. Fig. 22. From the centrum tendineum of a guinea-pig suffering from arti- ficial tuberculosis of the serous membranes (including the centrum tendineum). The preparation had been pencilled from the pleural surface and stained with nitrate of silver. M. p. III. 7. (Tube not drawn out.) Showing a patch in pleural serosa (j'^oung tubercle), which owes its origin to an intensive proliferation of the branched cells of the lymph-canalicnlar system. At A. the connection of that patch with the lymphatic capillaries, which bend in another layer than that represented in the figure. Fig. 23. From a silver-stained omentum of a guinea-pig suffering from chronic infective peritonitis. M. p. III. 7. F. Ground-substance of the fenestrated poi-tion of the omentum, over the surface of which a villus is projecting freely : A its radix, by which it is connected with the membrane; B its summit. a. Common flat endothelium of the general surface of the villus. h. Germinating endothelium. c. Vacuolated cells in the ground-substance of the villus. d. The same, containing young cells.

90 EXPLANATION OF PLATES. FiQ. 28. rrom tlie same mesentery of monkey as Fig. 25. M. p. III. 8. F, Ground-substance not represented. a. Large, coarsely-granular nucleated elements, -wbicli contain a various number of spherical or irregular globules of different sizes, which are homogeneous in structure, and are somewhat similar to fat globules, although they refract light differently. PLATE VI. Fig. 29. A preparation similar to that shown in Fig. 24. A vascularised patch of the normal omentum of rabbit. M. p. III. 8. a. Capillary blood-vessels. At b, their connection with the branched cells of the ground- substance ; these places represent at the same time where young capillaries are formed. c. The branched cells of the matrix. d. Similar ones of the ground-substance of the neighbourhood of the patch. Fig. 30. From a pencilled silver-stained normal omentum of rabbit. M. p. IV. 8. Representing a young patch, the ground-substance of which M is un- stained. a. The lymph-canalicular system, with the corresponding branched nucleated cells. b. Migratory cells, either perfectly detached from those branched cells or in a state of growing from them. c. Vacuolated element, which is a mere knob of a branched cell. In d the vacuolation has gone so far that a vesicle is formed, the wall of which has differentiated in endothelial plates. (Development of a lymphatic vessel.) At F division of the branched cells. FiQ. 31. From a silver-stained mesentery of a monkey suffering from chronic infective peritonitis. Representing a sprout fi'eely projecting over the surface.

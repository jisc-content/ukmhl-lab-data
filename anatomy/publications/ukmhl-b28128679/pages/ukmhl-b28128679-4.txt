/ i PEEFACE. WEBYONE who has undertaken the task of teaching young pupils the structure of the human frame and the arrangement of its organs has undoubtedly felt the insufficiency of ordinary diagrams and sketches; for it is impossible to give, by the use of such aids alone, a correct idea of the positions and relations of parts. The use of plaster models enables us to surmount this difficulty, but even here we are at a disadvantage; for such models, being expensive, are to be handled by the teacher alone, with the result that very few are able to look into the structure closely at one time. In this little work by Dr. Schmidt an admirable attempt has been made to give the readers a pictorial representation of the human body and its organs, such as may be examined and turned over by the youngest students; and, at the same time, to supply a simple description of its structure and functions. In preparing an English edition of this useful book, I have made no substantial alterations in the translation, but have simply checked the references, made such changes in the order of the text and in the wording as seemed to me essential, and have introduced a Table of Beferences to the anatomical model.

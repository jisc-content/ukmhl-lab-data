CHURCHILL NEW BURLINGTON STREET 1881■Mtwiuum) rmmwJPREFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION. In preparing a new edition of Practical Anatomy, I have had the advantage of submitting its pages to my friend and colleague, Mr. Rickman Godlee, who has care- fully revised it throughout. In deference to suggestions from Professor Thane and Dr. Carrington I have added a deep dissection of the neck from the side, and have made the dissection of the thorax a separate section. The number of coloured plates from Maclise’s “ Surgical Anatomy ” has been increased to twenty-four, and a few new woodcuts have been added. CHRISTOPHER HEATH. 36, Cavendish Square.

By Practical Anatomy is meant the study of Anatomy by dissection of the dead body, in contradistinction to Descriptive Anatomy, taught by lectures, diagrams, and preparations. In dissecting, there are four principal objects to be constantly borne in mind by the student:—1st. The impression on the memory of those facts of general anatomy taught in the lectures. 2nd. The study of those parts of the body more especially concerned in surgical affections and operations. 3rd. The education of the sense of touch, and of the hand in the use of instruments ; and 4th, the education of the eye in the knowledge of the several tissues of the body, in various positions, and under varying circumstances. It is to assist the student in these requirements that the following work is designed; and every effort has been made to present the facts of Anatomy in such a manner, that they may be most easily grasped by the mind and retained by the memory ; it will be found also, that as far as is compatible with a work of the kind, attention is drawn to all those points which have especial interest in the practice of medicine or surgery, and directions are given for the performance of many opera- tions which do not seriously interfere with or injure the dissection. The education of the eye is a gradual and tedious process, but one which is pretty certain to be satisfactorily accompli shed if the student do but use his hands properly, and therefore a few words on the manual part of dissection may not be out of place. First, as to the INSTRUMENTS requisite for dissection. A case containing six or eight scalpels, two pairs of scissors, a pair of dissect- ing forceps, a set of chain-hooks, a blow-pipe, and a probe, will enable the student to make all requisite dissections, supposing that he is allowed the use of a saw and chisel in the dissecting-room. nINTRODUCTION. 2 Great variety exists in dissecting cases, both as to form and expense, but so long as the instruments themselves are strong and good, the simpler the case the better. SCALPELS for dissection are made of two principal shapes ; in one, the edge is bevelled to the point, the back being straight; in the other, both back and edge are bevelled to a point midway be- tween the two. The latter form is preferable for most purposes. The blade should not be more than an inch and a half long, and never double-edged, but the material of which the handle is con- structed is a matter of indifference. For all ordinary dissection it will be found most convenient to hold the scalpel like a pen ; but for cleaning the fascia off muscles, and following out small nerves, it is better to hold it reversed, so that the back of the knife may be against the tissue wliich is to be preserved. In making the first incision through the skin of a limb, or in any other position where a long incision is required, the knife may, with advantage, be held under the hand, by which the wrist has more play, and the student has the opportunity of practising a mode of holding the knife which he will find very useful when operating on the living body. The FORCEPS should be broad at the extremities and coarsely serrated, so that it may retain a firm hold on small portions of tissue. It is very important that the forceps should not be too strong in the spring, for in that case it becomes so fatiguing to the hand that it is impossible to continue its use for any length of time. The forceps should be held lightly between the thumb and the first and second fingers of the left hand, which may be steadied by resting the little finger on a neighbouring part. The CHAIN HOOKS should be strong, and bent in the direction of the thickness and not of the breadth of the steel, as is sometimes done. These latter are very inferior, being liable to be unbent under any considerable strain. Care should be taken that the chains are firmly linked, and that the central ring is sufficiently stout to bear any force that may be applied to it. The SCISSORS should be large and strong, and it will be found to be advantageous to have one curved pair, which is very useful in preparing the ligaments. Sounds and staffs will be required for the purpose of practising the introduction of instruments into the bladder ; but these’ are found in most dissecting-rooms, together with saws and other large tools requisite for dissection. The student will do well to bear in mind that he will probably be called upon in after-life to operate on the living body, the only true preparation for which is careful dissection ; he should therefore, as3 INTRODU CTION. far as possible, conduct all his dissections as methodically and with as much care as if operating on the living body, and by this means he will do much to fit himself for his duties as a practical surgeon. The SKIN consists of two principal layers, the true skin or derma, and the scarf-skin or epidermis. In the dead body, if at all decom- posed, the epidermis or cuticle is easily separated, but should be carefully preserved during the dissection, as it prevents the subjacent parts from drying. In removing the skin, the first incisions should be made at once through its whole thickness, and a corner being held with the forceps, the knife is to be carried with a sweeping movement beneath it, the edge being towards the skin and the back to the fascia, which should be left smooth and uniform. The under surface of skin neatly reflected is white, and the tissue beneath it more or less yellow. The SUPERFICIAL FASCIA consists of loose areolar tissue containing more or less fat. It contains the superficial blood-vessels, nerves, and lymphatics, and may in some situations be divided into two layers. The DEEP FASCIA is a dense fibrous layer, -white and glisten- ing in appearance. It lies beneath the superficial fascia and forms sheaths for the limbs ; being attached to various ridges of bone, and sending processes (intermuscular septa) between the muscles. In cleaning muscles, it is essential to have the fibres stretched and rendered tense, which may be accomplished by moving the limb or applying the hooks. A muscle should invariably be cleaned along its fibres, the dissector beginning at one edge and advancing steadily to the other, and thus reflecting a complete layer of fascia ; the knife being held with the back to the muscle, to avoid injury to it. The attachments of a muscle (origin and insertion) should be most care- fully followed out, and studied on the separate bones; but it is important also to clean the fascia from the whole length of the muscle, or it will soon look dirty. A muscle should always be divided, when necessary, midway between its origin and insertion, so that these important points may be preserved for study. The ARTERIES of a subject are usually injected, and it is impossible to follow out all the minute branches without this assist- ance ; but opportunity should be taken by the advanced student to repeat his dissection upon an uninjected subject, in which the rela- tions and appearance of the parts more closely resemble those of the living body. The main trunks of the NERVES and their principal branches are readily followed out, but their minute ramifications require b 2INTRODUCTION. 4 more time and labour for their dissection than a student can afford to bestow upon them. The student should bear in mind that his manual labour is only a part of his duty, and will be thrown away, unless he at the same time study the description of the part upon which he is engaged ; he therefore should not carry the dissection further than he can learn the description on the same day, and at the subject; and should if possible re-peruse the description in the evening, and always on the next morning, before carrying the dissection any further. In order to preserve a part, it is essential that the dissector should himself secure the skin around it with a few stitches, and wrap it with damp cloths. These may be dipped in some preservative solu- tion, or common salt may be grated finely over the part. This latter, however, destroys the colour of the part and its smooth appearance. A dissected part should be sponged over daily, when it is uncovered for fresh dissection.PAET I. DISSECTION OF THE ARM. [The Student is requested to read the ‘Introduction’ before commencing the dissection, unless he has done so previously.'] Before beginning the dissection, the student should make himself fully acquainted with the external configuration of the part, and the relations of surface-markings to deeper structures ; and if he has already dissected this region, he should make the incisions necessary to expose the several arteries in the positions in which they are usually tied, according to the directions which accompany the description of each vessel, taking care not to disturb the tissues unnecessarily, and to stitch up the incisions without delay. The curves of the clavicle are generally seen with ease; but the finger should be carried along the bone to note any irregularity denoting old fracture, and to trace its articulation with the acromion process of the scapula. The sterno-clavicular joint should also be examined, and if the arm is freely moved, the extensive range of motion in that joint will be better appreciated. The development of the mammary region will vary according to the sex and age of the subject. In the case of a female subject, the advanced student should notice the condition of the nipple and its surrounding areola, as indicating previous pregnancies or the contrary, and may advan- tageously practise removal of the breast by two elliptical incisions, one above, the other below the nipple, taking great care to remove the whole of the breast, and not to leave any glandular tissue attached to the skin or the deeper structures. The roundness of the shoulder will be found to depend upon the projection of the head of the humerus beyond the bony arch formed above it by the acromion and clavicle, and in a thin subject the head of the bone and the bicipital groove may be readily felt when the arm is rotated. About a finger’s breadth to the inner side of the.6 DISSECTION OF THE ARM. head of the humerus, and indistinctly felt on account of the muscles attached to it, is the coracoid process, and the relation of these bones in health should be fully appreciated. In a muscular subject, a long, nearly vertical groove or dimple at this point marks the separation between the deltoid and pectoralis major ; and another, seen occasionally extending obliquely from near the inner end of the clavicle, marks the division between the sternal and clavicular fibres of the latter muscle. By lifting the arm and drawing it from the body, the anterior and posterior boundaries of the axilla will he made prominent, and the fascia extending from one to the other will be put on the stretch so that the finger cannot he pushed into the •armpit; whereas if the arm is brought to the side the fascia is relaxed, and the finger will readily reach the head and neck of the humerus, with the great vessels and nerves to their inner side, and internal to these again, the wall of the thorax, with probably some lymphatic glands. The brachial artery and nerves can he traced along the inner border of the biceps to the bend of the elbow, and the shaft of the humerus can he readily felt. In front of the elbow is a hollow, corresponding to a space to he afterwards dissected, and occasionally the superficial veins stand out prominently, in which case venesec- tion should he practised. The prominent internal condyle of the humerus and its relation to the olecranon process of the ulna are readily seen, and the ulnar nerve can he felt between the two points of hone. The rounded external condyle, with the ridge leading to it, can he felt in most subjects, as also the head of the radius, which should he rotated, that its relation to the condyle may be better appreciated. In the fore-arm the radius can he but little felt, except at its lower extremity; but the olecranon process and sharp posterior margin of the ulna are always to be distinguished even in very muscular subjects. It should be observed that the ulna is the more prominent of the two bones at its lower end, whilst the end of the radius is a little lower down than that of the ulna ; the styloid process of each can be readily distinguished. The tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris are usually prominent, and serve as guides to the radial and ulnar arteries, which may be felt (if injected) to the outer side of each tendon. The metacarpus and phalanges are to be examined, and the advanced student may advantageously amputate one or two fingers (middle or ring). It is to be borne in mind that the transverse markings, on either the palmar or dorsal aspect of the fingers, form no guide to the articulation, which is7 THE MAMMA. always nearer to the nail. When the finger is bent, the prominence at the articulation is due to the proximal phalanx, and the joint is below that point. The best rule, therefore, in amputating through the phalangeal articulations, is to bend the phalanx which is to be removed to a right angle with the one above it, and to begin the incision at a point midway in the thickness of the upper phalanx, cutting transversely to a corresponding point on the opposite side. The limb should be carefully bandaged from the fingers to the middle of the upper arm, and only uncovered as may be necessary in the progress of the dissection. [The arm being drawn away from the side, an incision is to be made half an inch to one side of the median line of the sternum in its whole length, and to be joined at right angles by another running along the whole length of the clavicle on to the acromion process, and thence in a vertical direction half-way down the upper arm, and then across the inner aspect of the arm as far as the posterior fold of the axilla. Another incision is to be made transversely from the ensi- form cartilage, and must be carried beyond the posterior fold of the armpit. The large flap of skin thus marked out is to be reflected towards the arm, the dissector on the right side beginning at the lower end of the sternum, and on the left side at its upper extremity.] Beneath the skin is the subcutaneous fascia, which is often very fatty in the female. The mamma will also be exposed (an incision being carried round the nipple so as to leave it attached to the organ) in the female, or its rudiment in the male subject. In a well- developed body the fibres of the platysma myoides may be seen arising from the fascia below the clavicle. The Mamma, or breast, is a gland of very variable bulk lying upon the great pectoral muscle, from which it is separated by a quantity of loose cellular tissue. Its base is nearly circular, and usually extends from the side of the sternum to the margin of the anterior wall of the axilla, reaching from the third to the seventh rib in the vertical direction. Near its centre, and between the fourth and fifth ribs is the mamilla or nipple, around which is the areola of discoloured skin, the tint of which becomes darker as pregnancy advances. The nipple may be shown to be pierced by numerous small lactiferous ducts by introducing bristles into their openings, and its skin is thin and delicate. The gland consists of numerous lobules bound together by tough cellular tissue, and having a quantity of fat interspersed between them. Each lobule is abundantly supplied with blood-vessels and has a separate galactoferous duct.

Cutaneous Nerves and Vessels.—In the superficial fascia on the front of the chest are the anterior cutaneous branches of the inter- costal nerves and arteries. They appear at regular intervals on each side of the sternum as they pierce the pectoral muscle, and are of small size. The terminations of the descending branches of the superficial cervical plexus may also be found beneath, or piercing, the platysma, and crossing the clavicle in the positions their names imply, viz. sternal, clavicular, and acromial. [The pectoralis major is to be put on the stretch by drawing the arm from the side and supporting it at a convenient height, its fibres are then to be cleaned from below on the right, and from above on the left side.] Pectoralis Major (Fig. 1, i) consists of a sternal and a clavicular portion separated by a cellular interval. The sternal portion arises from the whole length of one side of the sternum and from the carti- lages of all the true ribs except the seventh, and is connected below with the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. The clavicular portion arises from the inner or sternal half of the anterior border of the clavicle, and is separated from the deltoid muscle by another cellular interval, containing the cephalic vein and the humeral branch of the acromio-thoracic artery. The two portions are united at their insertion into the anterior or outer edge of the bicipital groove of the humerus, the muscle being doubled upon itself near its insertion, so that the sternal fibres pass behind, and reach higher up the bone than, those from the clavicle. The deeper portion of the insertion is more tendinous than the superficial fibres, which are closely con- nected with the deltoid. The action of the pectoralis major is to rotate the humerus inwards and then cross it over the chest. If the arm were raised above the 12. External oblique. 13.

It may also act as an ex-- traordinary muscle of inspiration when the arm is fixed, as is seen in the case of asthmatic persons. It is supplied by the external anterior thoracic nerve and partly by the internal anterior thoracic nerve. In very well developed subjects, muscular slips are not unfrequently found lying at the side of the sternum and superficial to the pectoralis, with which they may have some connection ; but they are more frequently continuous with the sterno-mastoid or rectus abdominis. The Axilla. [If the arm is well drawn from the side the boundaries of the axilla or armpit will be readily seen, and if the skin has not been already removed from the posterior boundary (latissimus dorsi), it should now be turned back. The strong deep fascia will be seen stretching from the pectoralis to the latissimus dorsi, forming the base of the conical space known as the axilla ; and the student should again notice that it is impossible to thrust the finger deeply into the space so long as the fascia is stretched by the extension of the arm, but that when the arm is drawn to the side the finger passes into the space,-and can feel the axillary artery (if injected), and the head of the humerus partially.] The lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal vessels and nerves are to be found behind the border of the pectoralis major, by carefully dividing the fascia parallel to the ribs. The first intercostal nerve has no lateral branch, but six lateral branches from the upper nerves (from 2nd to 7th) will be found appearing at the side of the chest, between the. digitations of the serratus magnus. Each lateral cutaneous nerve, except that of the second, divides into anterior and posterior branches, which turn forwards to the pectoral region and backwards over the latissimus dorsi respectively (Fig. 2). The lateral cutaneous branch of the second nerve passes down the inner side of the arm to join the lesser internal cutaneous nerve, or nerve of Wrisberg, and is hence called the intercosto-humeral nerve (24). The posterior branch from the third nerve usually accompanies and joins this. These last must be found at once and are to be carefully preserved. < [All the fat is to be removed from the axilla, and the muscles cleaned so far as they are exposed, care being taken not to injure the axillary vessels (particularly the vein) and nerves, which are to the outer side of the space ; nor the posterior thoracic nerve, which11 THE AXILLA. runs vertically upon the serratus magnus, about three inches from the edge of the pectoralis ; nor the subscapular vessels and nerves at the edge of the subscapularis.] The Axilla is a conical space between the chest and upper arm, and has the following boundaries :—In front is the pectoralis major muscle, with the minor beneath it; behind are the subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and teres major muscles; to the inner side is the Fig. 2.—The Axilla. 1.

The base of the cone has already been seen to be the axillary fascia stretched between the anterior and posterior boundaries, and the apex will now be found with the finger in a triangular interval between the clavicle, the upper border of the scapula, and the first rib. The great vessels and nerves lie along the outer boundary of the space, the artery being between the nervous cords and the vein to their inner side, whilst the branches of the artery take a general direction towards the thorax. On the inner side of the space and imbedded in fat are the glands, ten or twelve in number, which receive the lymphatics from the mamma and arm, the superficial ones lying along the edge of the pectoralis, and the deeper ones in close proximity to the axillary vessels, occasionally even surrounding them. Opportunity is to be taken, before any further dissection is made, to expose the lower part of the axillary artery thoroughly, as that is the portion of the vessel to which a ligature may be best applied. Surgery.— To tie the axillary artery: the arm being drawn away from the trunk, an incision, three inches long, is to be made in the length of the limb, at a distance behind the edge of the pectoral muscle equal to one-third of the whole width of the axilla. On dividing the deep fascia, the large axillary vein will come into view, which must be drawn down and held aside, when the large nervous cords will be seen, and a little dissection will expose the axillary artery placed deeply between them. The aneurism needle is to be passed from below (in this position), i.e. between the vein and artery. When the axillary artery is tied the circulation in the limb will depend upon the anastomoses between the branches of the artery above and below the ligature, i.e. of the superior and acromio- thoracic with the subscapular and circumflex arteries. These last will also bring blood by their anastomoses with the suprascapular and posterior scapular arteries from the thyroid axis. [The clavicular portion of the pectoralis major is to be divided vertically about its middle and reflected, without injuring the cephalic vein, when branches of the acromio-thoracic artery and the external anterior thoracic nerve will be seen entering its under surface. The upper border of the pectoralis minor will now be exposed, with the costo-coracoid membrane above it.] The Costo-Coracoid Membrane is the strong fascia seen im- mediately above the pectoralis minor, where it covers the axillary vessels and gives passage to the acromio-thoracic artery, the cephalicTHE AXILLARY ARTERY. 13 vein, and the external anterior thoracic nerve. It is attached to the coracoid process, to the lower surface of the clavicle, and to the first rib, and when divided will be seen to cover the axillary vessels and nerves and to enclose the subclavius muscle, being continued for some distance on the vessels, the sheath of which it strengthens. The Subclavius (Fig. 1, 5) is a small muscle which arises by a tendon from the cartilage of the first rib, and is inserted into the groove on the under surface of the middle third of the clavicle. It is a depressor of the clavicle, and is supplied by a special branch of the brachial plexus above the clavicle. The sheath of the axillary vessels is derived from the fascia in the neck, and passes beneath the clavicle. It is strengthened by a pro- cess of the costo-coracoid membrane, and is gradually lost upon the vessels. [The remains of the costo-coracoid membrane and sheath of the vessels are to be carefully removed without injury to the superior and acromio-thoracic arteries, and the axillary artery and vein and brachial nerves in their upper part are to be cleaned. This dissec- tion will admit light into the upper part of the axilla, and allow its boundaries and contents to be better studied. The remainder of the pectoralis major is then to be divided to expose the pectoralis minor with the long thoracic artery at its lower border.] The Pectoralis Minor (Fig. 1, 6) is beneath the pectoralis major, and therefore assists in forming the anterior boundary of the. axilla. It arises from the anterior extremities of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, about an inch from their junctions with the cartilages, and is inserted into the inner side of the coracoid process of the scapula, thus crossing obliquely the axillary vessels and nerves. The pectoralis minor would draw the coracoid process and scapula downwards, but is principally a muscle of inspiration, taking its fixed point from the coracoid process, and so raising the ribs. It is supplied by the internal anterior thoracic nerve. [The pectoralis minor is to be divided two inches from its insertion, when the axillary vessels and nerves will be fully exposed and are to be cleaned. The small nerve emerging from between the artery and vein, and entering the pectoralis minor, is the internal anterior thoracic.] The Axillary Artery (Fig. 2, 11) is the continuation of the sub- clavian, and extends from the lower border of the first rib to the lower border of the insertion of the teres major. In its upper part14 THE AXILLA. it is placed deeply in the axilla, hut its lower portion has been already seen to be comparatively superficial. The artery is divided into three parts, viz., first, or that above the pectoralis minor; second, or that beneath the pectoralis minor; and third, or that below the pectoralis minor. First part (from the lower border of the first rib to the upper border of pectoralis minor) has in front the pectoralis major muscle and the costo-coracoid membrane, and is crossed by the cephalic and acromio-thoracic veins, and external anterior thoracic nerve ; behind, it has the first intercostal space, with a digitation of the serratus magnus and the posterior thoracic nerve (external respiratory of Bell); to its inner side is the axillary vein, and to the outer the large cords of the. brachial plexus. This part of the artery gives off two branches, the Superior Thoracic and Acromio-thoracic. Second part (beneath the pectoralis minor) has in front the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor ; behind, at a little distance, is the sub- scapularis, with the posterior cord of the brachial plexus ; to its inner side are the vein and the inner cord ; and] on the outer side the outer cord of the plexus. The branches of this part of the artery are the Long Thoracic and Alar Thoracic. Third part (from the lower border of the pectoralis minor to the lower border of teres major) has the pectoralis major in front except at the lowest portion, and is also embraced by the two heads of the median nerve, which itself lies for a short distance in front of the artery ; behind, it lies upon the lower part of the subscapularis, the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, and a small portion of the teres major muscle, together with the musculo-spiral and circumflex nerves ; to its inner side is the axillary vein, with the inner head of the median nerve (for a short distance), the ulnar, the internal cutaneous and lesser internal cutaneous (Wrisberg) nerves ; to the outer side is the coraco-brachialis. muscle, with the outer head of the median, at first, but lower down the entire nerve, and also the external cutaneous nerve, until it pierces the coraco-brachialis. The branches of this portion are the Subscapular, Anterior Circumflex, and Posterior Circumflex. Branches of the Axillary Artery (Pig. 3).*— 1. The superior thoracic (3) is a small branch supplying the side of the chest about the first and second ribs, and anastomosing with the intercostal arteries. * The branches of the Axillary Artery may be kept in mind by the word SALASAP ; thus :—Superior thoracic, Acromio-thoracic, Long thoracic, Alar thoracic, Subscapular, Anterior and Posterior circumflex.17 THE BRACHIAL NERVES. artery ; lying to the inner and outer sides of and behind the second portion of that vessel; and the several branches derived from these trunks, and now to be examined, more or less surrounding the artery in its third part.* ( Outer cord .

The several branches are to be thoroughly identified, and their relations to the vessels ascertained {vide Axillary Artery) ; but the description of the majority is more conveniently taken at a later stage of the dissection. The External anterior thoracic nerve (n) is a small branch derived from the outer cord, going to the under surface of the pectoralis major, which it supplies. The Internal anterior thoracic nerve (io) is a small branch from the inner cord, which passes between the axillary artery and vein to supply the pectoralis minor and, after communicating with the pre- ceding nerve, the pectoralis major. The Circumflex (Fig. 3, 19) is a large nerve from the posterior cord, and lies behind the axillary artery for a short distance, leaving it then to accompany the posterior circumflex artery through the ■quadrilateral space already described, and winding round the humerus to the deltoid, to which it will be subsequently traced. Three Subscapular nerves (Fig. 4, 27, 28, 29) are derived from the posterior cord. The long subscapular nerve is seen at the lower border of the subscapularis muscle accompanying the subscapular artery, and ends in the latissimus dorsi, sometimes giving a branch also to the upper part of the teres major. The two shorter sub- scapnlar nerves will be better dissected when the arm is removed; they enter the subscapularis and teres major muscles, and supply them. The Posterior or long thoracic nerve (external respiratory of Bell) (16) lies upon the serratus magnus, which it supplies, and is one of the supra-clavicular branches of the brachial plexus, being derived * The brachial plexus may consist occasionally of only two cords when it enters the axilla; in which case a third cord is formed below the clavicle by the union of branches derived from these two cords, the relations to the artery re- maining the same as are given above. c18 THE AXILLA. from the fifth and sixth nerves, with an occasional branch from the seventh ; it descends behind the brachial cords and axillary vessels to its distribution upon the surface of the serratus.

The fibres have a general direction backwards to the inner surface of the base of the scapula, where they are inserted, but the first two digitations unite to form a thicker portion corresponding to the sur- face at the upper angle, while the last four form a still larger bundle, corresponding to the surface at the inferior angle of the scapula. These last slips interdigitate with the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. The serratus magnus is a great muscle of forced inspira- tion, taking its fixed point from the scapula, which is firmly held by the rhomboids and levator anguli scapulae muscles, and thus raising the ribs. If the muscle has the ribs for its fixed point, the scapula is drawn forward, the bone gliding over the ribs and a quantity of loose cellular tissue which lies upon them, and the strong bundle inserted into the lower angle serving to antagonize the levator anguli scapulae and rotate the scapula so as to raise the arm above the head. The serratus is supplied by the posterior thoracic nerve. Insertions of the Latissimus Dor si and Teres Major.—The upper part of the latissimus winds round the lower angle of the scapula, which it envelopes in a sort of fold, and ends in a broad, thin tendon, which passes in front of the teres major to be inserted into the bottom of th-ei bicipital groove of the humerus above the level of the teres major. The tendon of the latissimus dorsi, like that of the pectoralis major, is twisted, so that the fibres of the muscle which were highest at their origin are lowest at their insertion, and vice versa, and it is the narrowest of the three tendons inserted into the bicipital groove. The teres major, which is fleshy throughout, passes behind the tendon of the latissimus, being more or less incorporated with it* and is inserted into the inner or posterior edge of the bicipital groove, exactly opposite the pectoralis major, a bursa being formed between the insertions of the latissimus and teres. Opportunity should be taken, when the clavicle is divided by the dissector of the neck, to trace the axillary nerves to their origins, and to study the brachial plexus, the description of which is given with the “ Posterior Triangle.” 21.

The Front of the Upper Arm. [An incision is to be made down the front of the arm to three inches below the bend of the elbow, and the skin is to be reflected on each side for a couple of inches, to allow of the dissection of the superficial nerves and veins.] The Internal Cutaneous Nerve (Fig. 5, 8) is to be followed out from the inner cord of the plexus to the fore-arm. It lies at first to the inner side of the axillary artery, and then, piercing the deep fascia at or near the point at which the basilic vein enters, it runs in front of the inner condyle and subdividing, sends branches both over and under the median basilic vein to the inner side of the fore-arm. A posterior branch winds above the inner condyle to the back of the fore-arm. The Lesser Internal Cutaneous Nerve (nerve of Wrisberg) (Fig. 5, 2), after joining with the intercosto-humeral nerve, pierces the fascia at a variable point, and supplies the lower third of the inner side of the upper arm behind the internal cutaneous nerve. It is not always present. A cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve appears on the inner side of the upper arm, below the teres major, and is distributed to the skin (Fig. 5, 6). [The veins of the arm are very variable, and the best way of dis- secting them therefore, will be to follow both basilic and cephalic veins down to the elbow, and to trace out their radicles.] The Median Vein (Fig. 5, 14) is near the centre of the fore-arm and divides into two branches, the median basilic and median cephalic, which pass obliquely inwards and outwards respectively, to assist in forming the basilic and cephalic veins. Piercing the deep fascia near the centre of the bend of the elbow is the profunda vein, which joins the median near its point of bifurcation, and forms a communication between the vence comites of the arteries of the fore-arm and the super- ficial veins, the direction of the current of blood varying in different subjects. The Anterior and Posterior TJlnar Veins (Fig. 5, 12) end on the inner side of the fore-arm in a single trunk, which unites with the median basilic to form the basilic vein. The Basilic Vein (Fig. 5, 10) runs up the inner side of the arm to about its middle, where it pierces the deep fascia and becomes the axillary vein, receiving, at a variable point, the venoe comites of the brachial artery. To the inner side of the basilic vein, and about an inch above the condyle is a lymphatic gland of small size.21 cutaneous nerve. It is the vessel the median: cephalic vein. The Radial Vein (Fig. 5, 11) ascends on the outer side to join the median cephalic and form the Cephalic Vein (5), which passes up the outer side of the arm, between the pectoralis major and the deltoid, and has already been traced to its termination in the axillary vein. The Median Basilic Vein has important relations, since it lies su- perficially to the brachial artery, and crosses over or under the internal usually selected for venaesection on account of its size ; and protection is afforded to the artery beneath by the interposition of a process of fascia (bicipital or semilunar), which is connected with the tendon of the biceps, and may now be defined. The Median Cephalic Vein is of smaller size and crosses the tendon of the biceps, close to the outer side of which, and beneath the vein, the External Cutaneous Nerve (Fig. 5, 9) makes its appearance and supplies the adjacent parts. Above and to the outer side of the external cutaneous nerve will be found two external cutaneous branches of the Fig. 5.—Superficial dissection of the arm (from. Hirschfeld and Reveille). 1.

Fig- 5.22 FRONT OR THE UPPER ARM. musculo-spiraVnerve (7), the upper and smaller one running along the cephalic vein to the upper part of the front of the fore-arm; the lower passing to the hack of the fore-arm. Close to the deltoid may he found one or two cutaneous branches of the circumflex nerve (3). The deep fascia of the arm is sufficiently seen in following the superficial vessels and nerves. It is continuous with the fascia of the axilla and fore-arm, and is attached to ridges above the condyles of the humerus, forming the external and internal intermuscular septa, which give attachment to muscular fibres. The internal is the stronger, and is pierced by the ulnar nerve and the inferior profunda and anastomotica magna arteries. The external is pierced by the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery. [The muscles of the front of the arm are now to be cleaned together with the vessels and nerves, but the fascia on the upper part of the muscles of the fore-arm need not be disturbed.] The Biceps (Fig. 6, 7) is the superficial muscle of the upper arm, and arises by two heads which generally unite in the upper third of the arm, but occasionally remain distinct nearly to their insertion. The long or outer head cannot be fully traced at present, since it arises within the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint from the top of the glenoid cavity, and also from the glenoid ligament. Traversing the joint and enclosed in a tube of synovial membrane, the tendon enters the bicipital groove of the humerus, and is seen to emerge from the capsular ligament and lie upon the tendon of the latissimus, and between the insertions of the pectoralis major and teres major muscles. The short or inner head arises from the coracoid process of the scapula, in common with, but to the outer side of, the coraco- bracliialis, and the two heads unite to form a large fleshy belly. The fibres converge to a broad tendon, from which, immediately above the elbow-joint, an expansion, called the bicipital or semilunar fascia, is given off to join the fascia on the upper and inner part of the fore-arm (Fig. 8, 16). This must be divided in order to follow the tendon of the biceps, which passes deeply to be inserted into the back of the bicipital tubercle of the radius, a bursa being placed between the tendon and the upper smooth surface of the tubercle. The tendon becomes flattened near its insertion, and is twisted so that its outer edge becomes anterior. The action of the biceps is to supinate the fore-arm, and then flex it upon the upper arm (as in drawing a cork), being a good example of force applied to a lever of the third order. Its action as an abductor of the upper arm is very slight. The Coraco-brachialis (Fig. .6, 6) arises from the tip of the27 THE BEND OF THE ELBOW. having given a branch to that muscle, it lies between the biceps and the bracliialis anticus, both of which muscles it supplies. It finally becomes cutaneous at the outer side of the tendon of the biceps just above the bend of the elbow, ■where it has been already seen to lie beneath the median-cephalic vein. The Ulnar Nerve (Fig. 8, 8) arises from the inner cord of the brachial plexus, and lies close to the inner side of the axillary vessels, and afterwards in a similar relation with the upper part of the brachial artery. It leaves that vessel about the middle of the arm, piercing, and then running behind, the internal intermuscular septum, accompanied by the inferior profunda artery, to the interval between the internal condyle and the olecranon process. The ulnar nerve gives no branch in the upper arm. The Musculo-spiral Nerve (Fig. 8, 13) is derived from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, and lies at first behind the axillary artery and upon the subscapularis muscle with the circumflex nerve. It then rests upon the latissimus dorsi and teres major, and, after giving off a cutaneous branch to the inner side of the arm, winds backwards around the humerus, lying against the inner head of the triceps and disappearing between it and the outer head of that muscle. Branches supplying the triceps can now be seen, and in a subsequent dissection the nerve will be followed through the fibres of that muscle. Its lower portion is now visible between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus, to both of which and to the extensor carpi radialis longior, a branch may be traced; the division into radial and posterior interosseous nerves is also to be dissected out. The Bend op the Elbow. [The boundaries of the space in front of the elbow are now to be exposed by removing the fascia from the muscles of the fore-arm to the extent to which the skin has been already reflected, the tendons of the biceps and brachialis are to be thoroughly cleaned, and the fibres of the supinator brevis in the door of the space carefully dissected.] The Triangle in front of the Elbow (Fig. 9) is bounded above by an imaginary line drawn across the arm above the condyles, and below the apex is formed by the junction of the pronator teres and supinator longus two inches below the joint. The external boundary is the supinator longus, the internal the pronator teres, whilst the floor is formed, first, by the lower part of the brachialis anticus, and afterwards by the oblique fibres of ’the supinator brevis, which however cannot be seen until the space is opened up. The relations28 THE BEND OF THE ELBOW. of the superficial veins and nerves have heen already examined (p. 20), and the contents of the space are now seen to he (1) the median nerve, (2) the brachial artery, and (3) the tendon of the biceps, which lie in that order from within outwards.* The median nerve (2) lies nearly verti- Fig.'i). cally in the space, and disap- pears between the heads of the pronator teres : the brachial artery (4) usually bifurcates into radial and ulnar upon the insertion of the bracliialis anticus, the radial resting against the tendon of the biceps and supinator brevis, and the ulnar lying upon the bracliialis till it disappears beneath the pronator teres. The twisting of the biceps, tendon has already been re- ferred to. By slightly displacing the supinator longus outwards, the musculo-spiral nerve will be seen lying between it and the brachialis anticus and dividing into radial and pos- terior interosseous nerves ; but this nerve is not, strictly speaking, in the triangle. The radial nerve may be traced for a short distance upon the supinator brevis, whilst the posterior interosseous can be seen entering its fibres. It is supposed that by the time the dissection of the bend of the elbow is finished the subject will be turned, in which case the student of the arm should dissect the first two layers of the muscles of the back (see Dissection of the Back), proceeding afterwards with the following dissections. If necessary, however, the dissection * Artificial Memory, NAT. Fig. 9.—The bend of the elbow 1. Biceps. 2. Median nerve. 3. Musculo-spiral nerve. 4. Brachial artery and veins.

Since in some dissecting-rooms the dissector of the arm has no part in the back, the following directions are given for the removal of the limb :— [The two superficial layers of the muscles of the back comprise the trapezius, latissimus dorsi, rhomboidei, and levator anguli scapulae. These having been divided, the suprascapular artery and nerve and omo-hyoid muscle are to be traced to the upper border of the scapula, and the posterior scapular artery followed between the rhomboidei and the back of the serratus magnus. If the clavicle has been already divided in the dissection of the neck, the scapula can now be drawn away from the ribs and will be seen to be attached solely by the serratus magnus, between which and the ribs is a quantity of loose areolar tissue which enables the bone to glide smoothly upon the thorax. The serratus magnus having been divided, and the clavicle cut at its middle if still entire, the axillary vessels and nerves are to be severed after being tied together, and the entire limb removed from the trunk.] Parts about the Scapula. [The limb having been placed on the table, it is advisable to identify again the several insertions of muscles on the scapula, cutting each muscle to about an inch in length.] The trapezius extends along the whole length of the 'upper border of the spine of the scapula and for the outer third of the posterior border of the clavicle. The omo-hyoid arises from the upper margin of the scapula close to the notch and from the transverse ligament. The levator anguli scapulae is inserted into that part of the base of the scapula which is above the spine, the rhomboideus minor into the part opposite the spine, and the rhomboideus major into the base below the spine, by means of a tendinous arch to which the muscular fibres are attached. The serratus magnus is inserted into the inner surface of the base of the scapula for its whole length, but the fibres are much thicker at the upper and lower angles than in the centre. The small insertion of the pectoralis minor is attached to the inner border of the coracoid process, which also gives origin to the coraco-brachialis and the short head of the biceps. [A small block is now to be placed beneath the lower border of the scapula so as to put the deltoid on the stretch, and the remainder of its fibres are then to be cleaned, notice being taken of one or two small branches of the circumflex nerve which turn round its posterior border, and of a few descending acromial branches from the superfi- cial cervical plexus (Fig. 5, i) which supply the skin of the shoulder.]30 PAKTS ABOUT THE SCAPULA, The Deltoid Muscle (Fig. 10, 6) arises from the outer half or third of the anterior border of the clavicle and from the lower border of the acromion and spine of the scapula. Its strong coarse fibres converge to a point, and are inserted into a rough surface of a triangu- lar shape on the outer side of the humerus in the middle of the shaft, being embraced by the bifid origin of the brachialis anticus, and closely connected with the insertion of the pectoralis major. The action of the deltoid as .a whole is to raise the arm to the level of thq shoulder, i.e., to abduct the humerus ; but the anterior fibres will assist in flexion and the posterior in extension of the shoulder-joint. It is an example of power applied to a lever of the third order, and is supplied by the circumflex nerve. [The deltoid is to be divided near its origin and turned down, the circumflex vessels and nerve being preserved. In doing this a large bursa lying between the deltoid and the shoulder-joint should be noticed, as its enlargement may be confounded with disease of the joint. The remains of the trapezius muscle are to be cut close to the spine of the scapula, and the thin fascia covering the muscles above and below it remoyed, the humerus being rotated inwards to put their fibres on the stretch.] The Parts beneath the Deltoid Muscle (Fig. 10) are—the Infra- spinatus, Teres Minor, and Teres Major muscles, and the long head of the Triceps, with the head and neck of the humerus. The quadrilateral and triangular intermuscular spaces, referred to in the dissection of the axilla (p. 16), can now be seen from behind, when the quadrilateral or outer one will be found to be bounded by the teres major, teres minor, humerus, and long head of triceps ; the triangular or inner one, by the teres major, teres minor, and long head of triceps ; and the vessels and nerve they transmit are now to- be traced out. (A triangular interval between the teres major and the long and external heads of the triceps must not be mistaken for this latter space.) The posterior circumflex artery and circumflex nerve pass through the quadrilateral space ; the dorsalis scapulae artery lies in the triangular space, and the large musculo-spiral nerve with the brachial artery will be seen between the heads of the triceps. The Supra-spinatus Muscle (Fig. 10, 3) occupies the supraspinal fossa, arising from the greater part of the fossa itself, from the upper surface of the spine, and from the fascia covering the muscle. The tendon passes beneath the acromion to be inserted into the uppermost facet on the great tuberosity of the humerus, and slightly into the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint. In order to follow theni TERES MINOR MUSCLE. Oi. tendon thoroughly, the acromial end of the- spine of the scapula is to he divided with the saw, when a Lursa will he found between it and the muscle. The Infra-spinatus Muscle (Fig. 10, 5) arises from the whole of the infraspinal fossa except the part near the neck of the scapula ; Fig. 10. from the fascia covering the muscle, and from the intermuscular septa between it and the teres muscles. It is inserted into the middle facet on the great tuberosity of the humerus and into the capsule of the shoulder-joint, being blended there with the supra-spinatus and teres minor. The supra- and infra-spinatus muscles are supplied by the suprascapular nerve. The Teres Minor Muscle (Fig. 10, 9) arises from the dorsal aspect of the inferior costa or border of the scapula in nearly its Fig. 10.—Scapular muscles, vessels, and nerves (from University College Museum). 1.

It is inserted into the lowest facet on the great tuberosity of the humerus and for nearly an inch below it, and also ' into the capsular ligament of the shoulder. The teres minor is sup- plied by a special branch of the circumflex nerve which should be followed to it, and which is remarkable for having a gangliform enlargement upon it. The supra-spinatus is a feeble abductor, and the infra-spinatus and teres minor muscles are external rotators of the humerus. The Teres Major Muscle (Fig. 10, 7) arises from the triangular surface at the inferior angle of the scapula, and from the intermus- cular septa between it and the teres minor and infra-spinatus muscles. Its close relation to the latissimus dorsi has been already noticed, but its insertion into the inner lip of the bicipital groove should be again clearly seen. The teres major is supplied by one of the subscap- ular nerves, and is an internal rotator and adductor of the humerus. The Posterior Circumflex Artery (Fig. 10, 4) with its veins, and the Circumflex Nerve (Fig. 10, 2), appear through the quadri- lateral space, and are distributed to the under surface of the deltoid muscle, giving branches to the shoulder-joint; the nerve also supplies the teres minor muscle with a branch (on which may be found a gangliform enlargement) and gives a branch or two to the skin of the shoulder. The posterior circumflex artery not unfrequently arises from, or in common with the superior profunda, in which case, it is below instead of above the teres major. The Dorsalis Scapulae Artery (dorsal branch of subscapular) (Fig. 10, 11), does not pass through the triangular space as seen from behind, but winds beneath the teres minor in a groove on the inferior costa of the scapula, to supply the infraspinous fossa and anastomose with the other scapular arteries. It gives off the infrascapular artery, which will be afterwards traced beneath the subscapularis, and a superficial branch, which runs between the teres major and minor and down to the angle of the scapula, to anastomose with the sub- scapular and posterior scapular arteries. [The supra-spinatus is to be divided near its insertion, and the fibres cleared out of the supraspinal fossa in order to see the suprascapular artery and nerve and the origin of the omo-hyoid muscle.] The Suprascapular Artery (from the thyroid axis) passes over the transverse ligament of the scapula, and is distributed both to theSCAPULAR MUSCLES. S3 supraspinous fossa, and also to part of the infraspinous fossa, by a branch which winds in front of the spine and anastomoses with the dorsalis scapuke artery. The Suprascapular Nerve (from the 5th and 6th nerves of the brachial plexus) (Fig. 10, i) passes through the suprascapular notch and beneath the ligament, and is distributed to the supra- and infra- spinatus muscles. The Omo-hyoid Muscle arises from about half an inch of the superior border of the scapula immediately behind the suprascapular notch, and from the transverse or posterior ligament over it. Its relations and insertion are seen in the dissection of the neck. [The limb is to be turned over and the humerus rotated outwards to put the fibres of the subscapularis on the stretch; they should then be cleaned, care being taken of the subscapular nerves entering the muscle. The axillary vessels and nerves should be tied to the coracoid process, so as to bring them as nearly as may be into their proper positions.] The Subscapularis Muscle (Fig. 6, 4) is covered in by a thin fascia, and has been already seen to form part of the posterior wall of the axilla. It arises from the whole of the venter scapulae except the part to which the serratus magnus is attached and the portion nearest the neck of the bone, and has several tendinous septa between its fibres which are attached to the ridges on the surface of the bone. It is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus and the bone below it for an inch, and into the capsular ligament of the shoulder- joint, a large bursa intervening, which not unfrequently communicates with the cavity of the joint. The subscapularis is an internal rotator and adductor of the humerus, and is supplied by the short subscapular nerves. The most important action of the supra- and infra-spinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis muscles is their combination to keep the head of the humerus in its proper relation to the glenoid cavity, and thus prevent dislocation. In the post-mortem relaxed condition of the parts, the head of the humerus can be drawn away from the glenoid cavity to the full extent of the loose capsular ligament. 'The Subscapular Nerves (Fig. 4) are branches of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, and are three in number. The long subscapular nerve has been already seen in the axilla, and can still be traced to the latissimus dorsi ; the short subscapular nerves (upper and lower) are now to be followed, the upper to the subscapularis muscle, the lower to give a branch to the subscapularis and supply the teres major. DBACK OF THE UPPER ARM. 34 The Subscapular Artery is still to be seen along the lower border of the scapula, and its branches should be thoroughly followed out. The Infrascapular Artery is derived from the dorsal branch of the subscapular artery. It passes beneath the subscapularis muscle, which must be divided to expose it, and anastomoses with the neigh- bouring vessels. The Posterior Scapular Artery is to be found between the serratus magnus and the rhomboidei, and its anastomoses should be defined. By removing the muscular fibres from both surfaces of the scapula a very abundant network of vessels will be seen, formed by anasto- mosing branches from the arteries which have been already traced to the scapula : viz., the subscapular with its dorsal branch [axillary], the suprascapular [thyroid axis], and the posterior scapular [thyroid axis or subclavian]. The Back of the Arm. [The fore-arm and hand are to be doubled under the upper arm, which is to be placed on the table with the back upwards, and the scapula is to be drawn down with hooks so as to put the triceps on the stretch.] While the skin is being removed from the back of the arm two external cutaneous branches of the musculo-spiral nerve should be noticed. The upper smaller nerve (Fig. 5, 7) appears about the middle of the outer side of the arm, and runs downwards and forwards along the cephalic vein to the upper part of the fore-arm; the lower branch, of larger size (Fig. 11, 6), appears close above the external condyle, and will be afterwards traced down the back of the fore-arm to the wrrist. Branches from the internal cutaneous and lesser internal cutaneous nerves will be found on the inner side of the limb and distributed over the olecranon. When the strong deep fascia of the arm has been divided, the fibres of the triceps muscle should be cleaned, and a large bursa between the triangular posterior surface of the ulna and the skin should be noticed. The Triceps Muscle (Fig. 11, n) has of course three heads—the long or middle, the external, and the internal. The long head arises from a somewhat triangular rough surface on the inferior border of the scapula, immediately below the glenoid cavity. It has been already partly examined both from the front and from behind in relation with certain spaces (p. 30), and its fibres are now seen to be35 THE TRICEPS MUSCLE. separated by another somewhat triangular interval from the back of the upper third of the humerus, until it joins the fibres of the external head at the junction of the upper with the middle third of the bone. The outer head arises from immediately below the insertion of the teres minor into the greater tuberosity of the humerus, and from the outer side of the posterior aspect of the bone, as far down as the mus- culo-spiral groove; also slightly from the external intermuscular septum, which intervenes be- tween it and the deltoid. The inner head arises from the whole of the posterior aspect of the humerus below the insertion of the teres major and the musculo- spiral groove, to within half an inch of the elbow-joint on the inner side, and extending to the back of the condyle on the outer side. Its fibres arise on each side from the intermuscular septa which intervene between it and the muscles of the front of the arm. The whole of the fibres converge to be inserted into the top of the olecranon process of Fig. 11.—Dissection of back of upper arm (from Hirscbfeld and Leveille). 1. Infra-spinatus. 2. Deltoid. 3.

A small bursa intervenes between the tendon and the tip of the olecranon process, which will be seen when the joint is opened. The triceps is the great extensor of the fore-arm upon the upper arm, and its action is that of a force applied to a lever of the first order. The long head also adducts and draws back- wards the humerus. It is supplied by the musculo- spiral nerve. [The long head being hooked to the inner side, and the musculo-spiral nerve having been put on the stretch, the fibres of the outer head are to be divided sufficiently to fol- low the nerve, with the superior profunda artery, round the bone.] The Musculo-spiral Nerve (Fig. 11, 9) has been already shown (p. 17) to be a branch of the pos- terior cord of the brachial plexus, and has been seen to disappear between the internal and middle heads of the triceps ; it can now be followed in the oblique groove on the back of the humerus between the inner and outer heads of the muscle, until it reaches the interval between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus. It gives off numerous large branches to the triceps in its course, and Fig. 12.—A section through the middle of the right upper arm (altered from Beraud). 1. Biceps. 2. Cephalic vein. 3.

The Superior Profunda branch of the brachial artery closely accompanies the musculo-spiral nerve around the bone, and supplies the triceps in its course. At the outer edge of the triceps it gives off a large superficial branch which runs down to the elbow ; it then divides into two branches, one going to the back of the elbow beneath the triceps to anastomose with the interosseous recurrent and inferior profunda arteries ; the other running between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus to anastomose with the radial recurrent artery. The Front of the Fore-arm. [One incision is to be made down the middle of the fore-arm, and another at right angles to it across the front of the wrist, and the flaps of skin are to be turned to each side.] The Cutaneous Veins (Fig. 13) will be found in the superficial fascia, and can be defined without injury to the nerves. The Anterior Ulnar Vein (io) is pretty regular in its course, and will be found to commence in one or two small branches about the wrist; then running along the inner side of the fore-arm, it joins the Posterior Ulnar Vein (8) near the elbow and assists in forming the basilic vein. The Median Vein (9) is seldom in the centre of the arm at first, but commences near the root of the thumb, coursing obliquely to the ■centre of the arm near the bend of the elbow, where it is joined by the profunda vein and divides into median basilic and median cephalic branches (p. 21). The Radial Vein (7) commences at the back of the hand, and appears on the outer side of the fore-arm about its middle. It has been seen to imite with the median cephalic to form the cephalic vein (p. 21). Besides these named veins there are numerous smaller branches which assist, and occasionally take the place of, the larger ones. The Cutaneous Nerves (Fig. 13) are now to be followed out. The Internal cutaneous nerve (4) can be traced to the whole of the inner side of the fore-arm, the branches winding round to the back of the limb. It sometimes forms a junction with— A cutaneous branch of the 'Ulnar nerve (12), which may, with care, be found piercing the fascia about a hand’s breadth above the wrist.38 FRONT OF THE FORE-ARM. close to the edge of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon, which can be readily felt. The External cutaneous (musculo-cutaneous) nerve (5) is distri- bute! to the outer side of the front of the fore-arm, the branches winding round the edge of the limb to join with the radial nerv.e. A cutaneous branch of the Median nerve (14) pierces the fascia in the centre of the fore-arm about two Fig. 13. inches above the wrist, and passes, into the palm of the hand. The Deep Fascia is now to be cleaned, and will be found to be continuous with the deep fascia of the arm above, and with the an- nular ligament below. It gives numerous intermuscular septa in the fore-arm, which in a thin sub- ject are seen as white lines, running more or less in the length of the limb. [The muscles from the internal condyle are to be exposed by re- moving the deep fascia from the front of the arm, and they are then to be cleaned carefully in the direc- tion of their fibres.] Fig. 13.—Cutaneous dissection of the front of the fore-arm (from Hirschfeld. and Reveille). 1.

Beginning from the outer side, their relative positions are :—1, pronator teres; 2, flexor carpi radialis ; 3, palmaris longus (which may be absent); 4, flexor sub- limis digitorum ; 5, flexor carpi ulnaris. All these muscles have a common origin from (1) the internal condyle, (2) the fascia of the fore-arm, and (3) the inter-muscular septa derived from it; but three of them, viz., the pronator teres, flexor sublimis digitorum, and flexor carpi irlnaris, have extra bony attachments. The Pronator Radii Teres (Fig. 14, 4) arises from the internal condyle above the other muscles; from the fascia of the fore- arm over it; and from the intermuscular septum between it and the flexor carpi radi- alis. Its second head is from the inner side of the coronoid process of the ulna outside the origin of the flexor sublimis, the median nerve lying between the two heads. It is inserted by a broad tendon into the middle of the outer side of the radius, immediately below the supinator brevis. It pronates the hand by rolling the radius on the ulna, and flexes the elbow, and is supplied by the mediannerve. The Flexor Carpi Radialis (Fig. 14, 5) arises from the internal condyle in common with the remaining muscles; from the fascia of the fore-arm ; and from the intermuscular septa between it and Fig. 14.—Superficial muscles 1.

It ends about the middle of the fore-arm in a broad tendon, which soon becomes rounded, and disappears at the root of the thumb to pierce the annular ligament and pass through the groove in the trapezium, to he inserted into the base of the second, and slightly into the base of the third metacarpal hone. It is a flexor of the carpus and abductor of the hand, and is supplied by the median nerve. The Palmaris Longus (Fig. 14, 6) arises from the common attach- ment to the inner condyle; from the fascia of the fore-arm; and from the intermuscular septa on each side of it. Its long and narrow tendon passes superficially to he inserted into the strong palmar fascia in the centre of the hand, and slightly into that over the muscles of the thumb. It serves to make tense the palmar fascia, and thus protect the deep tissues of the palm, and may slightly flex the hand when largely developed. It is supplied by the median nerve. The palmaris longus is frequently wanting, hut it is occasionally largely developed, the whole length of the tendon being covered with strong muscular fibres connected with the flexor carpi radialis. The Flexor Carpi Ulnaris (Fig. 14, 8) arises from the common attachment to the internal condyle ; from the fascia of the fore-arm ; and from the intermuscular septum between it and the adjacent muscle. It has an additional aponeurotic origin from the inner side of the olecranon process and from the inner side of the posterior ridge of the ulna for two-thirds of its length, this latter origin being common to itself and the flexor profundus digitorum. The muscle is inserted by a flattened tendon (upon which the muscular fibres extend nearly to the wrist) into the pisiform hone, and slightly into the fifth metacarpal hone and the annular ligament. Between the two origins of this muscle the ulnar nerve enters the fore-arm, after winding close behind the internal condyle, and both ulnar artery and nerve will he seen beneath a process of the deep fascia close to the outer side of the tendon near the wrist. It is a flexor of the carpus and adductor of the hand, and is the only one of either the flexors or extensors of the carpus which is inserted directly into one of its bones. It is supplied by the ulnar nerve. The Radial Artery (Fig. 15, 17) is the smaller of the divisions of the brachial artery, and the part in the fore-arm extends from the- bifurcation at the bend of the elbow to the root of the thumb. It is superficial in the whole of this course, except that at the upper part it is more or less overlaid by the supinator longus muscle, the extent varying with the muscular development of the arm. It lies at first between the supinator longus and the pronator teres, but in41 THE RADIAL ARTERY. tlie lower half of the arm between the tendons of the supinator longus and flexor carpi radialis, which latter tendon is generally- taken as the guide to the vessel. To its outer side in addition it has the radial nerve, which in the upper third of the arm is at some little distance, in the middle third is in close relation, and in the lower third quits the vessel altogether by passing beneath the supinator longus. The radial artery lies upon (1) the tendon of the biceps (though this will depend upon the point at which the bifurca- tion takes place); (2) the oblique fibres of the supinator brevis ; (3) the inser- Fig. 15.—Superficial dissection of the front of the fore-arm (lrom Hirsehfeld and Leveille). 1.

The radial recurrent runs transversely beneath the supinator longus and gives ascending and descending branches, the ascending anastomosing with the superior profunda branch of the brachial artery. 2. Muscular branches are given off at various points to the adjacent muscles. 3. The superficialis voice arises near the root of the thumb and is of variable size. It runs forward, and generally beneath some of the fibres of the muscles of the thumb, to complete the superficial palmar arch formed by the ulnar artery. 4. The anterior carpal is a small branch which runs across the wrist beneath the deep tendons, to join a corresponding branch of the ulnar artery at the level of the lower border of the pronator quadratus. Surgery (Fig. 7).—The radial artery is readily tied, about an inch above the wrist, by an incision one inch and a half long, placed midway between the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and supinator longus, when the vessel will be found lying immediately beneath the deep fascia with the venae comites in close connection, but with no nerve near. The artery may be exposed in the upper part by an incision two inches long at any point in a line drawn from the centre of the bend of the elbow to the front of the styloid process of the radius, the knife going at once down to the supinator longus, which must then be carefully turned outwards. The position of the radial nerve to the outer side, in the middle third of the fore-arm, is to be borne in mind and the ligature passed from it. When the radial artery is tied, the circulation is mainly carried on by the ulnar and its branches, the anastomoses at the palmar arches being very free. [The pronator teres is to be divided about its middle, without injuring the median nerve or the origin of the muscle from the ulna,, which can now be thoroughly seen ; and the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus are to be divided so as to expose thoroughly the flexor sublimis, which is to be cleaned. The skin of the front of one of the fingers is to be carefully removed without interfering with the palm, and the sheath of the tendons dissected out (Fig. 15).] * The posterior relations of the radial artery are simply the muscles attached to the radius in their order from above downwards.DEEP MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. 4a The Flexor Sublimis Digitorum (perforatus) (Fig. 15, 16) is the only muscle of the fore-arm which has its origin from the three hones of the arm. It arises from the internal condyle of the humerus and slightly from the internal lateral ligament of the elbow ; from the intermuscular septa between it and the more superficial muscles ; from the inner side of the coronoid process of the ulna inside the pronator teres ; and from the whole of the oblique line on the front of the radius and part of the anterior border of this bone. Between the origins from the ulna and the radius is the median nerve. The muscle ends in four tendons, of which the two to the second and third fingers lie in front of those to the first and fourth fingers ; all pass under the annular ligament and through the palm of the hand to the second phalanges of the four fingers. The sheath of the finger which is exposed should be laid open along the centre, when it will be found to be thick opposite each phalanx (iligamentum vaginale), but thin at each joint, and to be attached to the lateral ridges on the first and second phalanges and to the base of the third phalanx. The sheath is lined by a synovial membrane which is continued into the palm and from which bands (vincula vasculosa) pass between the flexor tendons and the phalanges. The tendon of the flexor sublimis (perforatus) will be seen to be flattened on the first phalanx and split to give passage to the tendon of the flexor profundus (perforans), the two slips of the flexor sublimis being inserted into the sides of the second phalanx, and the tendon of the flexor profundus into the base of the third phalanx. The flexor sublimis is a flexor of the phalanges and then of the carpus, and is- supplied by the median nerve. The position of the ulnar artery, between the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris and the innermost tendon of the flexor sublimis in the lower half of the fore-arm, is now to be noticed, and by a slight separation of the tendons the ulnar nerve can be seen lying close to the ulnar side of the artery. This is the point where the ulnar artery is usually tied. [The flexor sublimis is now to be divided near its origins and turned down without injuring the median nerve, from which a branch may be traced to the deep surface of the muscle.] The Deep Muscles (Fig. 16) of the fore-arm are the flexor longus pollicis to the radial side, the flexor profundus digitorum to the ulnar side, and the pronator quadratus, a small square muscle with transverse fibres, to be seen above the carpus by drawing aside the tendons. These are now to be cleaned, all vessels and nerves being carefully preserved.44 FRONT OF THE FORE-ARM. Fig. 16. The Flexor Longus Pollicis (Fig. 16, 5) arises from the whole of the anterior surface of the radius between the oblique line and the at- tachment of the pronator quadratus, and from the outer half of the interosseous membrane in nearly its whole length. It very generally has a small additional origin, by a slip of very variable size, from the outer side of the coro- noid process of the ulna. A single round tendon passes beneath the annular ligament and through the palm of the hand, between the two heads of the flexor brevis pollicis, to be inserted into the terminal phalanx of the thumb. The Flexor Profundus Digitorum (per- forans) (Fig. 16, 4) arises from the anterior surface of the ulna between the coronoid pro- cess (which it embraces) and the origin of the pronator quadratus, and from the adjacent half of the interosseous membrane ; also from the upper two-thirds of the inner surface of the ulna, extending to the olecranon process and the posterior border of the bone, to which an aponeurosis is attached from which some of the fibres arise. The muscle ends in four tendons (that to the index finger alone being quite separate in the fore-arm), which pass beneath the annular ligament, and after giving origin to the lumbricales muscles in the palm, pierce the tendons of the flexor sublimis opposite the first phalanges, and are inserted into the bases of the third phalanges of the four fingers. The two preceding muscles are direct flexors of the thumb and fingers, and afterwards of the carpus. The flexor longus pollicis is supplied by the median nerve; the flexor profundus Fig. 16.—Deep muscles of the fore-arm (from Wilson). 1. Internal lateral ligament of the elbow-joint. 2.

The Pronator Quadratus (Fig. 16, 6) is the only muscle in the arm whose fibres are transverse. It arises from a somewhat oval surface on the front of the ulna helow the origin of the flexor pro- fundus, and is inserted into the whole of the front of the radius below the attachment of the flexor longus pollicis. This muscle is a powerful pronator of the fore-arm, and is supplied by the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve. The Ulnar Artery (Fig. 17, 16) arises from the bifurcation of the brachial artery at the bend of the elbow, and at once takes an oblique course inwards beneath the median nerve and four of the muscles arising from the internal condyle (pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor sublimis digitorum). It lies first upon the insertion of the brachialis anticus, and then upon the flexor profundus digitorum for the remainder of its course in the fore-arm, being bound down by a process of deep fascia. It is joined in the middle third of its course by the ulnar nerve, which lies to its ulnar side for the rest of its course in the fore-arm. In the lower third of the fore- arm both artery and nerve lie comparatively superficially between the tendons of the flexor carpi ulnaris and the flexor sublimis (but slightly overlapped by the former), until they hoth pass over the annular ligament into the hand. Two venae comites are in close relation with the artery. Surgery (Fig. 7).—The ulnar artery is easily reached in its lower part by an incision two inches long upon the outer edge of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris. The tendon being drawn a little inwards, it would only be necessary to divide the intermuscular layer of the deep fascia in order to expose the vessel with the nerve to its ulnar side. The operation for tying the vessel in its upper part between the flexor muscles is impracticable on the living body, but the vessel may be reached on the subject by separating the flexor carpi ulnaris from the flexor sublimis digitorum until the ulnar nerve is exposed, when the artery will be found to its outer side. When the ulnar artery is tied, the circulation is mainly carried on by the radial through the palmar arches, and also by the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries, which anastomose at the back of the fore-arm. Branches.—1. The Anterior ulnar recurrent will be found between the brachialis anticus and pronator teres, running up in front of the elboAV joint to join the anastomotica. 2. The Posterior ulnar recurrent is to be followed beneath the46 FRONT OF THE FORE-ARM. flexor sublimis and flexor carpi ulnaris to the back of the prominent internal condyle, where, after passing between the heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, it runs in the groove occupied by the ulnar nerve, and anastomoses with the inferior profunda and anastomotic arteries. 3. The Interosseous artery is a short trunk arising about two inches from the commencement of the artery, which is directed backwards to the interosseous space, where it subdivides into anterior and pos- terior interosseous branches. The 'posterior interosseous passes between the radius and ulna to the back of the arm, where it will be dissected. The anterior interosseous is to be followed down the front of the interosseous membrane, where it will be found lying with a branch of the median nerve between the flexor longus pollicis and flexor profundus digitorum, until it disappears beneath the pronator quadratus to reach the back of the wrist. The anterior interosseous artery gives off numerous muscular branches; a median branch to accompany the median nerve (sometimes of large size) ; and two nutritious arteries to the radius and ulna, which are directed towards the elbow. 4. The Carpal arteries, anterior and posterior, supply the front and back of the carpus, and anastomose with corresponding branches from the radial.* The Median Nerve (Figs. 15 and 17) enters the fore-arm between the heads of the pronator teres, and then passing between the origins of the flexor sublimis digitorum, crosses the ulnar artery to lie between the flexor sublimis and flexor profundus muscles. It is placed superficially between the flexor tendons near the wrist, and passes with them beneath the annular ligament into the hand. Branches.—The median nerve supplies all the muscles of the front of the fore-arm except the flexor carpi ulnaris and half the flexor profundus, in the following manner As soon as it enters the fore-arm it gives branches to the pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, flexor sublimis digitorum, and palmaris longus, and, after crossing the ulnar artery, gives off the anterior interosseous nerve (Fig. 17, 25). This passes down the front of the interosseous membrane, giving branches to the flexor longus pollicis and the outer half of the profundus digitorum, and then beneath the pronator quadratus (which it supplies) to the front of the wrist-joint, where it gives a branch to the articulation. * Professor Ellis enumerates a metacarpal branch, which is usually the con- tinuation of the posterior carpal artery to the back of the 5th metacarpal bone, as will be seen in the dissection of the back of the hand.47 THE ULNAR NERVE. 26. Digital branches of ulnar nerve. A cutaneous 'palmar branch (Fig. 15, 30) arises a short distance above the annular ligament, over which it passes to be distributed to the skin of the palm. The Ulnar Nerve (Fig. 17, 2) enters the fore-arm behind the internal condyle, by passing be- tween the heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris. It lies under cover of that muscle and upon the flexor profundus digitorum for the whole of its course in the fore- arm ; and about the middle third of the fore-arm comes into close relation with the ulnar artery, Pig. 17.—Deep dissection of the front of the fore-arm and hand (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

Branches (Fig. 17).—The ulnar nerve gives small articular branches to the hack of the elbow, and supplies one and a half of the muscles of the fore-arm, viz., the flexor carpi ulnaris and the inner half of the flexor profundus digitorum. In the lower third of the fore-arm the nerve gives a dorsal branch (20), which turns backwards beneath the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris to be distributed to the back of the little and half the ring finger. A cutaneous palmar branch of small size arises about the middle of the fore-arm, and after running down the front of the ulnar artery becomes cutaneous close above the annular ligament, and is dis- tributed to the skin of the palm on the ulnar side. The Radial Nerve (Fig. 17,13) is seen to arise from the musculo- spiral nerve opposite the elbow. It lies at first upon the supinator brevis, to the outer side of, and at some little distance from, the radial artery ; but in the middle thud of the arm it is in close relation with the artery on the pronator teres, finally passing beneath the tendon of the supinator longus to the back of the fore-arm and hand. The Back of the Fore-arm. [The front of the fore-arm having been dissected, the skin can be reflected from the back of the arm without further incisions, but an incision must be made along the inner border of the hand and across the knuckles, to permit the reflection of the skin from the back of the hand. An incision is also to be made along the thumb and each of the fingers, and the skin reflected, when the cutaneous nerves and veins are to be dissected out of the superficial fascia.] Cutaneous Nerves (Fig. 18).—The back of the fore-arm is supplied at the upper part by the branches of the musculo-spiral nerve (2) and internal cutaneous nerve (1), which were seen above the condyles of the humerus in the dissection of the back of the arm (p. 34). In addition and lower down, there will be found on the outer side of the limb, branches from the musculo-cutaneous nerve (4), and on the inner side, branches of the internal-cutaneous nerve (3); at the wrist, on the outer side, the large radial nerve (6) which pierces the deep fascia in the lower third of the fore-arm, and, after communicating with the musculo-cutaneous nerve, distributes digital branches to both sides of the thumb, fore-finger, and middle finger, and to the radial side of the ring finger, forming in addition a loop across the back of the hand with the following nerve.49 BACK OF THE FORE-ARM. The Dorsal branch of the Ulnar Nerve (Fig. 18, 7) appears on the inner side of the wrist, at a point corresponding to the lower end of the ulna, and gives digital branches to both sides of the little finger and the ulnar side of the ring finger, joining the radial nerve across the hack of the hand. The Superficial Veins (Fig. 18) of the hand form an arch across the back of the metacarpus, which joins the radial and posterior ulnar veins at its extremities; the veins of the fore-arm wind round the limb to join the radial and ulnar veins respectively, and one or two branches form communications be- tween them and across the back of the fore-arm. [The deep fascia is to be removed from the back of the fore-arm and hand, with the exception of a band about an inch wide, which is to be left opposite the lower end of the radius, to form the 'posterior annular ligament. The slender posterior in- terosseous artery to the outer side of the extensor carpi ulnaris is to be preserved. It will be found to be impossible to remove the fascia en- tirely near the elbow, where it is incorporated with the muscles.] Muscles of the Back of the Fore-arm (Fig. 19).—The muscles arising from the external condyle of the humerus are either extensors* * Artificial memory, Air-tensors from Ar-temal condyle. lig. 18.

Arising from the bones of the fore-arm alone and appearing from beneath the extensor communis digitorum, will be found four short extensor muscles which hold the following position to one another from the radial side 1, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis ; 2, extensor primi in- ternodii pollicis ; 3, extensor secundi internodii pollicis ; 4, extensor indicis. All the eight muscles attached to the humerus have additional origins from the fascia of the arm or from intermuscular septa derived from it; and two, viz., the extensor carpi idnaris and supinator brevis, have additional origins from the ulna. The Supinator Radii Longus (Fig. 19, 4) is a long, narrow muscle, and has been already seen in great part in the dissections of the bend of the elbow and fore-arm. It arises from the upper two- thirds of the ridge leading to the outer condyle of the humerus and from the external intermuscular septum of the arm, which separates it from the triceps ; and is inserted into the base of the styloid process of the radius, its tendon being crossed by two short extensors of the thumb at the annular ligament. It is supplied by a special branch of the musculo-spiral nerve, and its action is that of a feeble supinator and powerful flexor of the fore-arm, when the hand is midway be- tween pronation and supination. The Extensor Carpi Radialis Longior (Fig. 19, 5) arises from the lower third of the ridge leading to the external condyle and from the external intermuscular septum ; its tendon passes beneath the two extensors of the thumb and through the second division of the annular ligament, and having then been crossed by the tendon of the third extensor of the thumb, is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger (2nd metacarpal bone). The Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevior (Fig. 19, 6), which is beneath the longer extensor, arises from the outer condyle of the humerus; from the surface of the external lateral ligament; from the fascia of the fore-arm and from the intermuscular septum between it and the extensor digitorum. Its tendon passes, with that of the long extensor, beneath the two extensors of the thumb and through51 MUSCLES OF BACK OF THE FORE-ARM. 10. Extensor carpi ulnaris. fingers. the second division of the annular ligament ; and lastly beneath the third extensor of the thumb, to he inserted into the base of the meta- carpal bone of the middle finger (3rd meta- carpal bone). The Extensor Communis Dig-itorum (Fig. 19, 8) arises from the external condyle with the preceding muscles; from the fascia of the fore-arm, and from the intermuscular septa on each side of it. It ends in three tendons, which pass through the fourth divi- sion of the annular ligament with the extensor indicis and, the innermost having subdivided, the four tendons thus formed are inserted into the fingers in the following way:—Opposite the metacarpo-phalangeal joint each tendon sends slips to both sides of the base of the first phalanx, which are firmly bound to the phalanx and the metacarpo-phalangeal articu- lation ; it then expands upon the phalanx, being joined by slips from the lumbricales and interossei muscles ; this expansion is stronger at the margins than in the middle, and its sides are prolonged to the third phalanx, whilst the middle triangular portion is attached to the base of the second phalanx. This division is artificial and must be made with the scalpel, since the three parts are originally united. The tendon of the extensor indicis joins the ulnar side of the first or outer- most tendon at the first phalanx. The three innermost tendons of the extensor are joined Fig. 19.—Superficial muscles of the back of fore-arm (from Wilson). 1. Biceps. 2. Brachialis anticus. 3.

The Extensor Minimi Digiti (Fig. 19, 9) might be taken as a part of the common extensor, but is separated from it by an inter- muscular septum. It arises from the external condyle ; from the fascia and from the intermuscular septa on each side ; and its tendon, after passing through the fifth division of the annular ligament, is generally divided, both slips being inserted into the common expan- sion on the first phalanx of the little finger, but the innermost reach- ing further forward than its fellow (Fig. 22, 19). The Extensor Carpi Ulnaris (Fig. 19, 10) arises from the external condyle ; from the fascia and from the intermuscular septa on each side ; and has an additional origin from an expansion attached to the outer side of the posterior border of the ulna, the fibres covering but not being attached to all the inner part of the posterior surface of the bone. The tendon passes through the sixth division of the annular ligament and behind the styloid process of the ulna, to be inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger (5th metacarpal bone). The action of the extensors is implied by their names, but it should be noted that all the extensors of the carpus are inserted into the metacarpus. The extensor carpi radialis longior is supplied by the musculo-spiral nerve ; all the others by the posterior interosseous nerve, a branch of the musculo-spiral. The Anconeus (Fig. 19, 11) is a small triangular muscle on the outer side of the elbow, which is apparently continuous with the triceps, but is separated by a narrow cellular interval. It is covered by an expansion of the tendon of the triceps, which must be removed to expose it, when a branch of nerve from the musculo-spiral to the muscle is to be looked for and preserved. It arises from the back of the external condyle of the humerus by a separate origin, and spreads out to its fleshy insertion on the triangular surface upon the outer side of the olecranon and upper third of the ulna. The anconeus is an extensor of the fore-arm, and is supplied by a branch of the musculo-spiral nerve, which pierces its upper margin, and is accom- panied by a branch of the superior profunda artery. [The long extensors must be divided about the middle and turned aside in order to see the deep muscles thoroughly, but the supinator longus should be left uncut. The supinator brevis will require careful dissection beneath the origins of the other muscles, and the arm mustMUSCLES OF BACK OF THE FORE-ABM. 53 be fully pronated in order to stretcli the fibres whilst being cleaned. The posterior interosseous nerve piercing the muscle is to be carefully preserved and its branches traced to the extensors.] The Supinator Brevis (Fig. 20, 5) has very oblique fibres, which are covered at the upper part by a tendinous expansion or inter- muscular septum, from which some of them take their origin. It arises from the external condyle ; from the external lateral ligament .of the elbow ; from the orbicular ligament of the radius ; from the triangular space below the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and from the margin of bone below it as far as the attachment of the anconeus. Its fibres sweep round the radius and are inserted into the outer and back part of the neck of that bone above the oblique lines, with the exception of the bicipital tubercle and the posterior surface of bone above and below it. The supinator is pierced by the posterior inter- osseous nerve (which supplies it), and is separated from the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis by the posterior interosseous artery. It is a powerful supinator of the radius on the ulna. The Extensor Ossis Metacarpi Pollicis (Fig. 20, 6) is usually the only one of the special extensors of the thumb which has an origin from both bones of the forearm, though occasionally the next muscle has a double origin. It arises from the middle of the pos- terior surface of the radius for about two inches, the origin reaching across the bone from the interosseous line to the attachments of the supinator brevis and pronator teres ; from a corresponding portion of the posterior surface of the interosseous membrane ; and from two inches of the middle of the outer side of the posterior surface of the ulna, between the attachments of the supinator brevis and anconeus above, and the extensor secundi internodii below. The muscle “ crops out ” between the extensors of the carpus and fingers, and having crossed the extensor carpi radia'lis longior and the brevior obliquely, it passes on the outer side of the styloid process of the radius, through the first division of the annular ligament and over the radial artery, to be inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb (1st metacarpal bone), sending a slip to the trapezium and the short muscles of the thumb. The Extensor Primi Internodii Pollicis (Fig. 20, 7) arises from the back of the radius immediately below the extensor ossis meta- carpi pollicis and close to the interosseous line, for a space two inches long and half an inch wide; also from the radial half of the inter- osseous membrane for a corresponding distance. Its tendon lies to the ulnar side of the tendon of the extensor of the metacarpal bone in its whole course, passing through the same division of the annular54 BACK OF THE FORE-ARM. Fig. 20. ligament, and is prolonged to be inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. The Extensor Secundi Internodii Pol- licis (Fig. 20, 8) arises from the middle of the outer half of the posterior surface of the ulna (between the origins of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis above, and the indicator below), and from the ulnar half of the cor- responding portion of the interosseous mem- brane. Its tendon becomes superficial just above the annular ligament, through which it passes very obliquely in a separate division (the third) ; then crossing the tendons of the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior and the radial artery, it runs along the ulnar side of the extensor primi internodii to be inserted into the base of the terminal phalanx of the thumb. This muscle varies very much in size. The Extensor Indicis (indicator) (Fig. 20, 9) arises from the posterior surface of the ulna below the preceding muscle (by the size of which its attachment is influenced), and slightly from the interosseous membrane. Its tendon is covered by those of the common extensor, and running through the fourth division of the annular ligament with them, is inserted into the common expansion on the back of the first phalanx of the fore-finger. The actions of the special extensors are im- plied by their names. They are all supplied by the posterior interosseous nerve.

It appears between the supinator brevis and extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis (usually), giving muscular branches to the extensor muscles and a recurrent branch to the elbow joint ; and terminates by joining the pos- terior carpal arteries and also the terminal branch of the anterior in- terosseous artery {id), which will be found to reach the back of the arm by piercing the interosseous mem- brane immediately above the lower end of the radius. The recurrent (6) branch runs upon or through the supinator brevis to the outer and back part of the elbow, where it anastomoses with the superior pro- funda and recurrent radial arteries. The Posterior Interosseous Nerve (Fig. 21, 9) is a division of the musculo-spiral, which has been already seen to divide on the outer Fig. 21.—Dissection of the musculo-spiral nerve and its branches (from ilirsch- feld and Leveille). 1.

The posterior interosseous nerve can now be traced running obliquely in the fibres of the supinator brevis, and at its lower border breaking up into muscular branches and an articular branch to the wrist. The muscular branches supply the extensor carpi radialis brevior, extensor communis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, extensor carpi ulnaris, the three special extensors of the thumb and the indicator ; and the supinator brevis is supplied by a branch or two as the nerve passes through it, and must be divided to see them. The articular branch to the wrist is the continuation of the nerve, and reaches the interosseous membrane between the extensors of the first and second phalanges of the thumb ; passing beneath the latter muscle it runs to the back of the carpus, beneath the tendons of the extensor communis digitorum, where a gangliform enlargement may be found. The Radial Artery at the wrist (Fig. 22, 18).—After leaving the front of the lower end of the radius (p. 40) the radial artery lies against the external lateral ligament of the wrist-joint, and beneath the extensors of the metacarpal bone and first phalanx of the thumb. It then winds over the back of the carpus, to the interval between the metacarpal bones of the thumb and fore-finger, where it is crossed by the extensor of the second phalanx of the thumb, and lastly passes into the palm of the hand between the two heads of the abductor indicis (first dorsal interosseous muscle). The Branches (Fig. 22) of the radial artery at the wrist very commonly vary, but should be five in number. 1. The Posterior carpal (17) is a small branch which runs trans- versely close upon the bone immediately below the annular ligament, to join the posterior carpal branch of the ulnar and form an arch. From this two dorsal interosseous arteries are given, which run on the third and fourth interosseous muscles, and receive the perforating arteries which appear between their heads of origin. 2. The Metacarpal (20) is the first dorsal interosseous artery, and closely resembles the others. It runs on the second interosseous muscle, and at the root of the fingers often joins the digital branch from the front of the hand. 3 and 4. The Dorsales pollicis (24) are two small arteries which are distributed on the metacarpal bone of the thumb; one is often wanting. 5. The Dorsales indicis (22) is a similar branch, which runs along the metacarpal bone of the index finger. This is frequently replaced by a large artery which runs along the metacarpal bone and divides into branches to the fore-finger and thumb, being in fact the radialis indicis, a branch of the radial in the palm, arising earlier than usual.57 POSTERIOR ANNULAR LIGAMENT. The Posterior carpal branch (Fig. 22, 17) of the ulnar artery will he found appearing beneath the extensor carpi ulnaris, and hav- ing completed the arch formed by the posterior carpal of the radial, it ends in a branch to the ulnar side of the fifth metacarpal bone. The Posterior Annular Li- gament (Fig. 19, 15) is attached to the radius externally, and to the cuneiform and pisiform bones internally. It has six subdivi- sions, which should be carefully examined and compared with the grooves on the bones. The first division corresponds to the groove on the outer side of the styloid process of the Fig. 22.—Arteries of the back of the fore-arm (drawn by G. E. L. Pearse). 1. Inferior profunda. 2.

A fulness on each side of the palm corresponds to the special muscles of the thumb and little finger respectively, and the terms “ thenar ” and “ hypo-thenar ” are sometimes applied to them. The palm presents three Curved lines, the proximal and distal ones being curved in opposite directions, whilst the middle runs obliquely across the palm to join the proximal line at the outer side of the hand. It will be found on dissection that the point to which the superficial palmar arch reaches, corresponds pretty accurately with the centre of this middle line, whilst the point of bifurcation of the digital arteries is midway between the distal or anterior line and the web of the fingers. [An incision is to be made down the middle of the palm to the roots of the fingers, where another is to be drawn across the whole width of the hand, and the two flaps of skin are to be dissected up and turned in opposite directions. It will Ire found best to pay little attention to the unimportant cutaneous palmar branches of nerves, and to carry the knife at once through the fine granular fat of the palm down to the glistening palmar fascia and annular ligament. The fascia covering the muscles of the thumb and little finger is much thinner than that in the centre of tire hand, and will require care for its preservation. The skin may be at once reflected from over the outer side of the hand, but upon the inner side a small trans- verse muscle (palmaris brevis) is to be found just below the pisiform bone, and is to be preserved with the piece of skin into which it is inserted.] The Palmar Fascia (Fig. 14, 9) consists of three portions. The central is triangular in shape and is attached to the annular ligament by its apex (into which the palmaris longus is inserted), whilst it expands at the roots of the fingers to become connected with the sheaths of the flexor tendons. Opposite the heads of the metacarpal bones it splits into four parts, and numerous transverse fibres will be found strengthening the membrane at these points, where also the digital vessels and nerves become subcutaneous. Each of the four slips which have been mentioned finally subdivides to be attached to the sides of the four sheaths of the flexor tendons. The lateral por- tions of the palmar fascia are much thinner, and simply form a covering for the muscles of the thumb and little finger. The Palmaris Brevis (Fig. 13,16) is a small muscle placed trans- versely below the pisiform bone and immediately beneath the skin. Arising from the inner edge of the central fascia it crosses the ulnar61 PROFUNDA ARTERY. artery and nerve, and is inserted into the skin on the inner side of the hand. It is supplied by the nlnar nerve, and is often absent. [The central portion of the palmar fascia is to be detached from the annular ligament and turned down, care being taken not to injure the vessels and nerves which are close beneath, and these are to be cleaned.] The Superficial Palmar Arch (Fig. 15, 34) is the direct con- tinuation of the ulnar artery, which reaches the hand by passing over the annular ligament. The vessel is subject to very great variations, but if regular, forms an arch with the convexity forwards, reaching to about midway between the annular ligament and the root of the middle finger. The arch is completed on the radial side either by the superficialis voice branch of the radial artery, which generally pierces a few of the fibres of the muscles of the thumb, or more commonly by the radialis indicis (p. 67), the superficial volar being absent. From the convexity of the arch, and principally from its ulnar side, are given off four digital arteries, the first of which runs to the ulnar side of the little finger, whilst the three others bifurcate about half an inch from the web of the fingers to supply the radial side of the little finger, both sides of' the ring, both sides of the middle, and the ulnar half of the index finger. These branches should be traced along the sides of the fingers, and will be found to inosculate in the pulp of the terminal phalanx, being accompanied by the digital nerves ; but the relation between them differs in the palm and in the fingers,—in the former the arteries are superficial to, in the latter they are deeper than, the nervesi Each of the three outer digital arteries at its point of bifurcation re- ceives a communicating branch from the deep arch (radial artery), and the branch to the forefinger inosculates at its tip with a branch on the other side of the finger also derived from the radial (radialis indicis). The Profunda Artery is a small communicating branch arising from the ulnar artery as soon as it has crossed the annular ligament. It passes deeply, with an accompanying branch of the ulnar nerve, between the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti, and will be found to complete the deep palmar arch of the radial artery. The superficial palmar arch is subject to considerable variation, one of the most common irregularities being its non-completion by the superficialis volae, in which case it generally joins the radialis indicis at the root of the index-finger. The median artery from the anterior interosseous (p. 46) may be large, and join the superficial palmar arch or supply digital branches. The Ulnar Nerve (Fig. 15, 26) accompanies the ulnar artery overPALM OF THE HAND. 02 tlie annular ligament, lying to its ulnar side, and immediately divides into a superficial and a deep portion. The deep branch (28) accom- panies the profunda branch of the ulnar artery between the muscles of the little finger, all of which it supplies, and will be seen again in the deep dissection of the palm. The superficial division subdivides into two digital branches which supply one and a half fingers, the inner one running on the ulnar side of the little finger, and the other bifurcating at the roots of the fingers into branches for the radial side of the little and ulnar side of the ring finger, the latter uniting with a branch of the median nerve. The digital nerves can be traced along the sides of the tendinous sheaths, lying superficially to the arteries and joining one another in the pulp of the finger, where the corpuscles of touch (Paccini) are developed like little buds upon a twig. A large branch also passes backward at the tip of the finger to supply the matrix of the nail. The ulnar nerve gives a small branch to the palmaris brevis muscle.* The Anterior Annular Ligament (Fig. 25, 1) is the broad band of fascia binding down the iiexor tendons at the wrist, and is only a thickened portion of the common fascia of the limb. It is attached to the scaphoid bone and to the ridge of the trapezium on the outer side, and to the unciform process of the unciform bone and slightly to the pisiform bone on the inner side. The ulnar artery and nerve and the cutaneous palmar nerves cross it, and also the tendon of the palmaris longus in part. (The tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris sends an expansion over the ulnar artery and nerve, which must not be mistaken for the annular ligament itself.) When divided in the middle, its outer attachment will be seen to be perforated by the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, and to have beneath it the median nerve and the tendons of the flexors of the thumb and fingers. Beneath the annular ligament and closely connected with the tendons and median nerve, will be found a quantity of loose bursal tissue, containing a synovial cavity, which generally, but not constantly, communicates with the special sheath of the thumb and little finger. The use of this tissue is to facilitate the movements of the tendons, and it occasionally becomes diseased, when fluid is developed in it in considerable quantity, and forms a fluctuating tumour above and * It will be observed that the number of fingers supplied by the ulnar artery is the complement of that supplied by the nerve, and that the same rule holds with respect to the radial artery and the median or radial nerves, thus :— Ulnar artery . . . 3| fingers. 1 ^ Ulnar nerve . . . .

This tissue must he carefully dissected away. The Median Nerve (Fig. 17, 33) passes beneath the annular ligament superficially to the tendons, and divides into two trunks which subdivide into four digital nerves, to supply three and a half fingers. The first or outermost, after giving a small branch to supply some of the short muscles of the thumb, bifurcates into branches to supply the two sides of the palmar aspect of the thumb ; the second digital nerve supplies the radial side of the index-finger, after giving a small twig to the first lumbricalis muscle ; the third, after supply- ing the second lumbricalis, bifurcates near the root of the finger to supply the ulnar side of the index and the radial side of the middle fingers ; the fourth bifurcates to supply the ulnar side of the middle- finger and the radial side of the ring-finger, this last branch joining the branch from the ulnar nerve previously seen. The digital branches of each finger unite in the pulp of the terminal phalanx, and have Paccinian corpuscles developed on them like those of the ulnar nerve, and also give branches to the matrix of the nail. [The ulnar ar-tery is to be divided beyond the origin of the pro- funda and the arch turned down as far as possible, but the nerve may be left uncut. The median nerve is to be divided at the wrist and turned down, and the flexor tendons with the lumbricales muscles cleaned and traced to their insertions. The sheaths of the flexor tendons have been already described (p. 43), but at least one more should be laid open in order that the tendons may be well seen.] The Tendons of the Flexor Sublimis, four in number, pass beneath the annular ligament and lie immediately beneath the median nerve in the palm. Each tendon becomes somewhat flattened, and on the first phalanx splits into two portions, which are inserted into the sides of the second phalanx, giving passage to the tendons of the flexor profundus between them. The vincula accessoria or syno- vial slips which unite the tendons to the sheath (ligamenta longa), and also the short elastic bands (ligamenta brevia) connecting each tendon with the front of the first phalanx, should be observed. The Tendons of the Flexor Profundus (Fig. 25, 8), also four in number, lie beneath the corresponding superficial tendons, which they perforate over the first phalanges ; they then pass on to be inserted into the bases of the third phalanges. Each pair of tendons is lubricated by a synovial sheath, that of the little finger (together with that of the flexor of the thumb) com- municating with the general synovial cavity beneath the annular ligament already described.64 PALM. OF THE HAND. The Lumbricales (Fig. 25, 7) are four little muscles connected with the deep flexor tendons, and bear some resemblance to a worm (lumbricus). The first lumbricalis, counting from the radial side (and sometimes the second), arises from the radial side of a single tendon, but the others arise by distinct slips from the adjacent sides of two deep tendons. The four muscles end in small tendons which wind to the radial side of the four fingers, and, passing over the transverse ligament of the metacarpus, are inserted into the expansion of the extensor tendons on the back of the first phalanges. The lum- bricales act with the interossei as flexors of the first phalanges and extensors of the second and third phalanges. The first and second have been seen to be supplied by branches of the median nerve ; the third and fourth receive branches of the deep branch of the ulnar nerve, which will be seen in the deeper dissection. The Tendon of the Flexor Longus Pollicis (Fig. 25, 9) is at the same level as the tendons of the flexor profundus, and can be traced between the halves of the flexor brevis pollicis to the base of the terminal phalanx of the thumb. It lies in a fibrous sheath of its own, but the synovial sheath communicates with the one beneath the annular ligament. [The tendons of the flexor profundus are to be divided (but not the flexor pollicis) and turned down with the lumbricales ; the muscles of the little finger and thumb are to be carefully dissected.] Muscles of the Little Finger. The Abductor Minimi Digiti (Fig. 25, 10) is the most superficial and the innermost of these. It arises from the pisiform bone and slightly from the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and is inserted into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx. The Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti (Fig. 25, 11) is often insepar- ably united with the abductor; but the deep branches of the ulnar artery and nerve which pass between the two will serve as guides to the point of separation. It arises from the unciform process of the unciform bone and from the annular ligament, and is inserted with the abductor into the base of the first phalanx. The Opponens Minimi Digiti is the deepest of the set, and arises from the unciform process close to the preceding muscle and from the annular ligament. It spreads into a triangular shape, and is inserted into the inner margin of the shaft of the fifth metacarpal bone, thus resembling the opponens pollicis as to insertion, although the power of “ opposition ” in the little finger is much more limited than in the thumb.65 MUSCLES OF THE THUMB. Fig. 25. Muscles of the Thumb. The Abductor Pollicis (Fig. 25. 2) is a slender muscle, and is the most superficial of the series. It arises from the ridge on the trapezium, and from the annular ligament. It is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, with the outer half of the flexor brevis. It must be divided to see the following :— The Opponens Pollicis (Fig. 25, 3) arises from the front of the trapezium and from the annular ligament, and is inserted into the outer border of the shaft of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. Its action is to “oppose” the thumb to the fingers, an action peculiar to man and monkeys, the muscle being sometimes called the flexor ossis metacarpi pollicis. The Flexor Brevis Pollicis (Fig. 25, 4) consists of two por- tions at its insertion, between which the tendon of the long flexor is placed, one head being more or less conjoined with the adductor, and the other with the abductor pollicis. It arises from the lower part of the annular ligament, from the front of the trapezium, trapezoides and os magnum, the bases of the second and third metacarpal bones, and the sheath of the flexor carpi radialis. The two heads are inserted into the sides of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, and into the sesamoid bones which are developed at this Fig. 25.—Muscles of the hand (from Vi llson). 1.

In this way, according to Duclienne, the small muscles of the thumb (with the exception of the opponens) extend the second phalanx whilst acting upon the first phalanx in the directions implied by their several names. Fig. 26. The Adductor Pollicis (Fig. 25, 6) arises from the anterior surface of the lower two-thirds of the shaft of the middle metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb with one part of the flexor brevis, the muscle forming a triangle with its base to the ulnar side. The muscle necessarily covers the muscles in the first and second interosseous spaces (wliich may be seen in part at its anterior border), and will have to be divided subsequently to expose them thoroughly. The Deep Branch of the TJlnar Nerve (Fig. 17, 22) is to be traced out, and will be round to arise from the ulnar trunk near the pisiform bone, and to pass between the flexor brevis and the abductor minimi digiti, giving branches to them and the opponens. It then forms an arch across the bases of the metacarpal bones, accompany- ing the deep palmar arch, and supplying the two innermost lumbri- cales muscles and the seven interossei muscles (palmar and dorsal) ; and ends by supplying the adductor and the inner half of the flexor brevis pollicis.* * It may assist the student in remembering the distribution of the ulnar nerve if he notices how it is governed by the number 1|; thus, the neiwe sup- plies one and a half muscles in the fore-arm; gives branches to one and a half lingers on both palmar and dorsal aspects; and lastly, supplies one and a half muscles of the thumb.

The deep arch has a slight convexity towards the fingers, and is placed upon the bases of the metacarpal bones, being completed by the deep branch of the ulnar artery. Before terminating in the deep palmar arch the radial artery gives off two branches, viz. :— 1. Princeps pollicis, a large branch of uncertain origin, and frequently arising from the radial "at the back of the abductor indicis ; it passes along the metacarpal bone of the thumb, and then bifurcates to supply both sides of the thumb superficially. 2. Ecidialis indicis, which runs on the palmar aspect of the abductor indicis to the forefinger, of which it supplies the radial side, giving a branch of communication to the superficial palmar arch, and anastomosing at the tip of the finger with the digital artery derived from the superficial arch. The deep arch gives some small recurrent branches to the carpus ; three perforating arteries to the dorsum, which pass between the heads of the three inner interosseous muscles ; and three interosseous arteries which run on the three palmar interosseous muscles to the roots of the fingers, and then anastomose with the digital branches of the superficial arch at their points of bifurcation. The tendon of the Flexor carpi radialis can now be easily traced through the groove in the trapezium to its insertion into the base of the second metacarpal bone. The Transverse Metacarpal Ligament (Fig. 35, 14) passes in front of the heads of the metacarpal bones, and is closely connected with the sheaths of the flexor tendons. It must be divided to follow out the palmar interossei, which pass beneath it. The Interosseous Muscles are seven in number, three palmar and four dorsal. Two of the palmar interossei are readily seen, but the adductor pollicis must be entirely detached from the middle metacarpal bone in order to expose the remaining one. The Three palmar interossei (Fig. 27) are muscles placed in the three metacarpal spaces between the fingers, and are numbered 1st 2nd, and 3rd from the radial side. They are arranged as ad-ductors of the fingers to an imaginary line drawn through the long or middle finger, as follows :—The 1st palmar interosseous muscle arises from the ulnar side of the 2nd metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the r 268 PALM OF THE HAND. ulnar side of the corresponding first phalanx; the 2nd arises from the radial side of the 4th metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the radial side of the corresponding first phalanx ; the 3rd arises from Fig 27. Fig. 28. the radial side of the 5th metacarpal hone, and is inserted into the radial side of the corresponding first phalanx. The Four dorsal interossei (Fig. 28) are penniform muscles arising from the adjacent sides of the metacarpal bones, and therefore showing by the side3 of the palmar muscles to some extent, but are best dissected from behind. They are arranged as adductors from an imaginary line drawn through the middle or long finger, and are therefore inserted as follows :—The 1st (abductor indicis) into the radial side of the base of the first phalanx of the fore-finger ; the 2nd Fig. 27.—The three palmar interosseous muscles of the hand (drawn by J.

These muscles vary slightly as to their attachments, hut the following points respecting them have been elucidated by Duchenne’s electrical investigations :—The insertion into the base of the first phalanx (Fig. 29), enables the interossei to act as flexors of that phalanx, whilst giving lateral move- ment to the fingers to which they are attached. The slip (d) sent forward to join the expansion of the extensor tendons extends the second and third phalanges ; and thus the action of the interossei is shown to include adduction to and abduction from the median line of the hand, with flexion of the first and extension of the second and third phalanges. [The interosseous muscles of the hand should he compared with those of the foot, when the same arrangement will he found to exist in both cases, with the exception that, in the foot, the imaginary line is drawn through the long or second toe, and that the muscles are arranged in corresponding relation.] Ligaments of the Scapula. [The muscles about the scapula are to he followed to their exact insertions and cut short; the deltoid and the remains of the trapezius must he carefully removed in order that the ligaments of the scapula and clavicle may he seen.] The Acromio-Clavicular Articulation (Fig. 30) is a simple Fig. 29.—Attachment of an interosseous muscle (from Duclienne). a.

The Superior acromio-clavicular ligament (Fig. 30, i), is a quadri- lateral hand of short strong fibres, more or less connected with the fibres of the trapezius and deltoid. It Fig- 30. is in reality continuous with the in- ferior acromio-clavicular ligament, which is similar in shape, but placed below the joint. The Coraco-Clavicular Ligament (Fig. 30, 2) is really but one ligament twisted upon itself so as to present two surfaces, to which the names Conoid and Trapezoid have been given; if the spine of the scapula has been di- vided, this twisted arrangement can be readily undone. The Conoid Ligament is the more posterior portion, and resembles a cone with the base upwards. It is attached to the posterior and inner part of the base of the coracoid process lelow, and to the tubercle on the under surface of the clavicle and part of the adjacent bone above. The Trapezoid Ligament might be more suitably called rhomboid from its shape. It is a quadrilateral band of fibres .attached to the line on the posterior part of the upper surface of the coracoid process below, and to the line leading to the tubercle on the under surface of the clavicle above. It is anterior and external to the conoid ligament.* The Coraco-Acromial Ligament (Fig. 30, 3) is a triangular band attached to the outer side of the coracoid process, and by its smaller end to the tip of the acromion process, and is often divided into two portions. It arches above the shoulder-joint and prevents dislocation upwards. * The relation of the ligaments may he remembered by the letters a e in trapezoid, which is anterior and external to the conoid.

The Transverse Ligament (Fig. 30, 4) is a short hand con- verting the suprascapular notch into a hole, and giving origin to part of the omo-hyoid muscle. The suprascapular artery goes over the ligament, hut the nerve beneath it. The movements between the scapula and clavicle are very slight, hut the two hones move freely together upon the thorax, the sterno- clavicular joint {vide Side of Neck) admitting of movement in every direction. The scapula is raised by the trapezius (upper part), levator anguli scapulae and rhomhodei muscles ; being again de- pressed by the weight of the arm, assisted probably by the pectoralis minor, the lower fibres of the trapezius, and (indirectly) by the latissimus dorsi. It is drawn forward by the serratus magnus, and backward by the rhomboidei. The rotation of the scapula upon the ribs, by which the head of the bone is elevated and the arm is raised beyond a right angle with the trunk, is due to the trapezius and to the strong lower fibres of the serratus magnus ; the upper fibres of the latter muscle, the rhomboidei and the pectoralis minor acting in the opposite direction. The Shoulder Joint. [The muscles surrounding the shoulder are to be carefully removed, those which are inserted into the tubercles of tlife humerus being dissected as close to the capsular ligament as possible without injuring it, and then cut short.] The shoulder is an enarthrodial or ball-and-socket joint, and has therefore a capsular ligament. It is surrounded and strengthened by thd^following muscles :—above by the supra-spinatus, below by the long head of the triceps, in front by the subscapularis, and behind by the infra-spinatus and teres minor. The shoulder-joint admits of the following movements—flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, rotation, and circumduction, which may be conveniently taken to resemble the same movements in the hip-joint. Thus the humerus is flexed (in front of the trunk) by the pectoralis major and coraco-bracliialis muscles, and the anterior fibres of the deltoid. It is extended (behind the trunk) by the latissimus dorsi, teres major, and posterior fibres of the deltoid. It is adducted by the weight of the limb, by the action of the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, the two teres muscles, and coraco-brachialis, and abducted by the deltoid and supra-spinatus. Rotation of the humerus upon the glenoid cavity is produced outwards by the infra- spinatus and teres minor, inwards by the subscapularis, teres major, latissimus dorsi, and pectoralis major muscles. The last two musclesLIGAMENTS OF THE ARM. 72 are antagonistic in the fact that the pectoralis major draws the arm across the chest after rotating it, whilst the latissimus dorsi draws it behind the hack. The Capsular Ligament (Fig. 30, 5) is seen to be loose, allowing partial dislocation of the humerus now that all the muscles are divided, and rough, owing to the insertion of some of the muscles of the scapula into it. There is frequently an opening on its inner side, by which the bursa of the subscapularis communicates with the articular cavity. It is attached above to the outer margin of the glenoid cavity of the scapula, and below to the anatomical neck of the humerus, and is pierced at its lower margin by the long tendon of the biceps. It is thickened in front by a band of fibres attached to the root of the coracoid process and called the Coraco-humeral liga- ment. The tendon of the biceps is to be followed into the articulation by laying open the capsular liga- ment, when it will be found to be surrounded by a tube of synovial membrane, and having become flattened, to be attached to the glenoid ligament and upper part of the glenoid cavity. This tube can be demonstrated before the capsule is opened by making traction upon the ten- don, when the tube will be everted (Fig. 31). The Glenoid Ligament (Fig. 31,4) is a fibrous ring con- tinuous with the tendon of the biceps and surrounding the glenoid cavity, which it therefore deepens. There is a single Synovial Membrane in the shoulder joint, which is reflected over the articular surfaces and capsular ligament; it forms a tube around the tendon of the biceps which is prolonged into the bicipital groove.

[The muscles about the elbow are to be removed, and great care must be taken in detaching the supinator brevis not to remove or damage the external lateral and the orbicular ligaments. Beneath the triceps close to the joint may be found a little slip of muscular fibre attached to the lower end of the hu merus and the back of the joint; this is the Subanconeus, which is however often wanting or but slightly developed. All the muscles of the fore-arm and hand should now be removed to facilitate the examination of the wrist, &c. In removing the deep muscles of the fore-arm, care must be taken not to injure the interosseous membrane and the oblique ligament.] The articulation of the humerus and ulna is a good example of ginglymus, or hinge-joint, and therefore has lateral ligaments ; the articulation of the upper end of the radius is an example of diarthrosis rotatorius, the head being surrounded by a ring partly of bone and partly of ligament; and the articulation between the head of the radius and the outer condyle of the humerus is an example of simple arthrodia. The ligaments of the elbow are united together and form one general capsule, but may be divided into anterior, posterior, external lateral, and internal lateral. The elbow-joint has in front the brachialis anticus with the brachial artery and median nerve; behind are the triceps and an- coneus muscles. To the inner side are the muscles arising from the internal condyle, and the ulnar nerve with the inferior profunda artery lies upon the internal lateral ligament. Externally the muscles arising from the external condyle, with the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery, are in relation, and the supi- nator brevis is closely connected with the external lateral liga- ment. The fore-arm is flexed by the biceps, brachialis anticus, and supinator longus, and indirectly by the flexors of the wrist and fingers. It is extended by the triceps and anconeus, and indirectly by the extensors of the wrist and fingers. Rotation of the radius upon the ulna and humerus, and consequently pronation and supina- tion of the hand are produced as follows,—Pronation by the pronator quadratus and pronator teres, supination by the biceps, supinator brevis, and very feebly by the supinator longus. The Anterior Ligament (Fig. 32, i) is a broad membrane attached to the humerus immediately above the coronoid fossa, and to the edge of the coronoid process of the ulna, and partly to the orbicular ligament of the radius. The Posterior Ligament (Fig. 33, 8) is thin and loose, and is74 LIGAMENTS OF THE ARM. attached to the upper margin of the olecranon fossa of the humerus, and to the edge of the olecranon process of the ulna. The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 32, 2) is triangular, the Fig. 32. Fig. 33. processes are separated by a cavity. apex being attached to the promi- nent internal condyle, and the base being attached all along the inner margins of the coronoid and olecranon processes, and bridging across the notch between them. The External Lateral Liga- ment (Fig. 33, 4) is a short thick band attached to the outer con- dyle, and radiating slightly at its attachment to the upper border of the orbicular ligament of the radius. The Synovial Membrane will be seen by removing the anterior ligament, and will be found to be reflected between the humerus, radius, and ulna, and also into the small joint between the head of the radius and the lesser sigmoid cavity. The articular surfaces of all the bones are encrusted with cartilage, but occasionally those of the coronoid and olecranon re across the bottom of the sigmoid 1. 2. 3. 4.

Superior (Fig. 34, 3).—This is a part of the elbow joint, and con- sists of the Orbicular ligament, a strong flat hand of fibres which is attached to the extremities of the lesser sigmoid cavity, and gives insertion to the external lateral ligament of the elbow, which must be removed to see the orbicular ligament satisfactorily. Middle (Fig. 32, 5).—The Interosseous ligament or membrane is the great bond between the shafts of the bones of the fore-arm, its fibres running obliquely downwards from the radius to the ulna. It is attached to the sharp interosseous borders of both bones in all their lower part, a space being left between the bones above, through which the posterior interosseous vessels go. The membrane has a large opening in it near the lower part for the anterior interosseous artery, and one or two smaller ones for its branches. The Round or oblique ligament (Fig. 32, 4) is very rarely seen, but is a band attached to the outer side of the coronoid process of the ulna and to the radius below the bicipital tubercle. Its direction is therefore the reverse of that of the interosseous membrane. Inferior (Fig. 35, 2) is formed by anterior and 'posterior ligaments, which are short fibrous bands passing between the extremities of the radius and ulna, and by an inter-articular fibro-cartilage which will be seen when the joint is opened (Fig. 37, 3). The Wrist Joint. This is a condyloid joint or hinge-joint admitting of considerable lateral movement, and has anterior, posterior, and two lateral ligaments. The wrist joint has in front the radial artery, the tendons of the flexor longus pollicis, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor sublimis and profundus, with the median nerve, ulnar artery and nerve, and flexor carpi ulnaris. To the outer side, the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi and primi internodii pollicis, with the radial artery and nerve. Behind, the extensor carpi radialis longior and the brevior, extensor secundi internodii pollicis, extensor communis digitorum, indicis, and minimi digiti, and the extensor carpi ulnaris (Fig. 24). The Anterior and Posterior Ligaments (Fig. 35, 3) are broad bands attached to the front and back of the lower end of the radius and to the front and back of the first row of carpal bones, being united with the ligaments of the carpus. The External Lateral Ligament (Fig. 35, 4) is a thick bandLIGAMENTS OF THE ARM. 76 attached to the styloid process of the radius, and to the outer side of the scaphoid and trapezium.

The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 35, 5) is longer than the external, and is attached to the styloid process of the ulna, and to the upper surface of the cuneiform hone. The Bones of the Carpus (Fig. 35, 6) are bound together by vertical and transverse dorsal and palmar, and at each side by slender lateral ligaments, which will not repay a special dissec- tion ; also by interosseous liga- ments which bind together the several bones of each row (except the pisiform which has a sepa- rate capsular ligament), and will be seen when the joints are opened (Fig. 36). The Metacarpal Bones (Fig. 35, 8) (with the exception of the first) are connected with the second row of the carpus by dorsal and palmar ligaments, and the four metacarpal bones are joined together by transverse dorsal, palmar, and interosseous ligaments. The first metacarpal bone has a separate capsular ligament con- necting it with the trapezium, this joint being enarthrodial (Fig. 35, 9). The bones of the carpus and metacarpus are capable only of a slight gliding or arthrodial movement, with the exception of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, which is capable of flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction. The movements of the Eig. 36.—Section, showing the disposition of the chief synovial membranes of the -wrist-joint (from Wilson). I. Sacciform membrane. II. Second synovial membrane. HI.

[The synovial membranes of the wrist are to he opened by the following incisions on the dorsal aspect of the hand; one between the lower ends of the radius and ulna (care being taken not to divide the fibro-cartilage), and three transverse incisions carried between the lower end of the radius and the carpus, the two rows of carpal bones, and the carpus and metacarpus respectively. The articulations of the pisiform bone and of the first metacarpal hone are also to be opened.] The Synovial Membranes of the Wrist (Fig. 36) are five in number. The 1st or membrana sacciformis is between the lower ends- of the radius and ulna, and extends between the ulna and the triangular fibro-cartilage ; the 2nd is between the radius and the under surface of the triangular fibro-cartilage above, and the three outer bones of the first row of the carpus below ; the 3rd is between the first and second rows of carpal bones, passing between the several bones as well; it is prolonged between the bones of the second row to the metacarpal bones, and is reflected over the bases of the four inner bones as well as between them; the 4th is between the cuneiform and pisi- form bones ; the 5th between the tra- pezium and the metacarpal bone of the thumb. The Triangular fibro-cartilage (Fig. 37, 3) is best seen by removing the carpus altogether. It is attached by its base to the margin of the radius, between the surfaces for articulation with the ulna and the carpus, and passes transversely between the lower end of the ulna and the carpus, to be attached by its apex to the root of the styloid pro- cess of the ulna. The Metacarpus and Phalanges (Fig. 35) are connected by anterior, posterior, and lateral ligaments. The Anterior ligaments are strong fibro-cartilaginous bands passing Fife. 37.

The Posterior ligament is a distinct structure beneath the expansion of the extensor tendons. The Lateral ligaments are strong hands which are attached to the sides of the heads of the metacarpal bones, and pass obliquely to the anterior margins of the phalanges. Each joint has a separate synovial membrane. The Phalangeal Articulations are similar to those between the metacarpus and phalanges. The articulations of the carpus and metacarpus may be remem- bered by the formula— R R 4 4 3 1 4 4 7 5 13 12 1 Thus the Scaphoid and Semilunar articulate each with 4 carpal bones and the Radius ; the Cuneiform with 3, and the Pisiform with 1 carpal bone each. The Trapezium and Trapezoides with 4, the Magnum with 7, and the Unciform with 5, carpal and metacarpal bones respectively. The numbers in the third row give the articu- lations of the several metacarpal bones with the carpus only, but in addition the adjacent hones of the four fingers articulate with each other.TABLE I.

[The Student is requested to read the ‘ Introduction ’ before commencing the dissection, unless he has done so previously.] Before beginning the actual dissection, the student should make himself fully acquainted with the external configuration of the part and the relations which superficial appearances hear to deeper struc- tures. If he has already dissected this region he should also make the incisions necessary to expose the several arteries in the positions in which they are usually tied, according to the directions which accom- pany the description of each vessel, taking care not to disturb the tissues unnecessarily, and to stitch up the incisions without delay. External appearances.—The fold of the groin separates the abdomen from the thigh, and the finger, if carried along it, will recognise Poupart’s ligament stretched tightly across, when the limb is fully extended. In the same position also the front of the thigh will be convex owing to the large extensor muscles, but if the knee be slightly bent and the thigh abducted, a shallow depression will be seen immediately below the groin corresponding to Scarpa’s triangle, and Poupart’s ligament will be felt to become relaxed. Lymphatic glands of variable size can be felt along, or a little above the line of Poupart’s ligament; whilst below it, and more or less in a vertical direction, will be found others which belong strictly to the thigh. In the centre of the hollow on the front of the thigh can be felt the femoral artery, which may be followed for about a third of the length of the thigh in a thin subject. A subcutaneous vein (saphena) is occasionally to be seen, when enlarged, on the inner side of the limb, and the course of others joining it is occasionally visible. If the body should be the subject of femoral hernia, probably the hernial tumor will be found occupying the upper part of the hollow in the front of the thigh, and reaching more or less along the lower border83 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. of Poupart’s ligament. In sucli a case, if the hernial protrusion he returned, the finger can he readily passed into the enlarged saphenous opening and up into the crural ring behind Poupart’s ligament. The crest and anterior superior spine of the ilium will he readily seen and felt, the anterior inferior spine less so, on account of the muscles covering it; the spine and crest of the pubes can also he distinguished. The great trochanter is easily recognised from three to four inches below the crest of the ilium, and should be thoroughly manipulated that its relation to the upper border of the pelvis and surrounding parts may be clearly appreciated during the movements of the limb ; and the. two sides of the body should be compared if any morbid change about the hip is suspected. An important diagnostic sign of a healthy condition of the neck of the femur is, that when the limb is rotated the trochanter describes part of the arc of a circle, which is not the case when fracture exists. When an impacted fracture or absorption of the neck of the femur has taken place, the arc is much smaller and the movement less complete. The head of the femur may be felt behind the trochanter when the limb is rotated, and in a very thin subject it may be detected in front, when the finger is thrust deeply into Scarpa’s triangle. Fig. 38. A Nekton’s test line for dislocation of the head of the femur upwards or backwards is one drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the tuberosity of the ischium (Fig. 38, a b), which in health touches the top of the great trochanter.

G 284 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. neck of the femur is one taken vertically from the anterior superior iliac spine when the body is recumbent (Fig. 38, a c), from which the distance (c d) to the top of the great trochanter can be accurately measured. The condyles of the femur and the patella are to be examined, and . it should be noticed how large a part of the articular end of the femur is uncovered by the patella when the knee is flexed. The ligament of the patella and its attachment to the tibia are to be noticed, and the finger carried along the subcutaneous surface of the tibia, the shin, down to the ankle. The head of the fibula is prominent, and the hand carried to the back of the knee will recognise the outer and inner hamstrings attached to it and to the tibia, and when the knee is flexed may feel the popliteal artery behind the joint. The lower third of the fibula is subcutaneous and terminates in the prominent external malleolus, behind which the peroneal tendons can be felt. On the inner side, the inner malleolus is to be examined, with the tendons behind it, and at the back of the limb the Achilles tendon attached to the heel. The foot is to be moved freely, when it will be found that the amount of lateral motion in the ankle joint is greatest when the toe is thoroughly pointed. In the same position the broad upper articular surface of the astragalus becomes subcutaneous, and is readily seen beyond the margin of the tibia. In the foot, the following points of practical utility should be thoroughly recognised ; first, on the inner side, the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone, to which the tendon of the tibialis posticus may be traced, and which is the guide in Chopart’s amputation of the foot ; secondly, the slighter prominence of the internal cuneiform bone and base of the first metatarsal bone in front of it, to which the tendon of the tibialis anticus may be traced, and which serve as a guide in Hey’s amputation ; and thirdly, on the outer side, the prominent base of the fifth metatarsal bone, which serves the same purpose. The toes are commonly much distorted owing to the long pressure of ill-fitting shoes, and the metatarso-plialangeal articulation of the great toe is not unfrequently diseased, forming a bunion. The Front of the Thigh. [An incision is to be made along Poupart’s ligament and carried down the inner border of the thigh, for half its length, and this is to be joined by another across the limb at that point; the flap of skin thus marked out is to be carefully reflected to the outer side of the thigh.]85 FRONT OF THE THIGH. The Superficial fascia of the thigh is continuous with the superficial fascia of the abdomen over Poupart’s ligament, and generally contains a good deal of fat, particularly in the female subject. It is divisible into two layers in the upper part of the thigh, and the deep layer will be seen by reflecting the superficial layer in the same way as Fig. 39.—Superficial dissection of the inguinal and femoral regions (from Wood ‘On Rupture’). a. Superficial layer of fascia (re- flected) . b. Deeper layer of fascia (reflected), the superficial vessels being left attached to the external oblique. c. Inguinal lymphatic glands. d.

The Superficial Vessels (Fig. 39) are branches of the femoral artery -with their accompanying veins, and are three in number, viz.:— The Superficial epigastric artery (e), which arises from the femoral immediately below Poupart’s ligament, and passes upwards and inwards over the front of the abdomen. The Superficial circumflex iliac artery (d), a small branch running outwards a little below Poupart’s ligament. The Superior external pudic artery (/), running inwards over the spermatic cord to the scrotum, or to the labium in the female. The Veins correspond in course and will be seen to open into the saphena vein. The Lymphatic glands will also be found between the layers of superficial fascia, and are arranged in two rows, one along the groin, to which the lymphatics of the penis, scrotum, and anus pass, and another below the groin in the direction of the thigh, into which the lymphatics of the limb empty themselves. The relation of the lym- phatics to these glands is to be borne in mind, since the position of a bubo will vary according to the part primarily affected,—genitals or foot. I The Nerves are the terminations of the ilio-inguinal and crural branch of the genito-crural, from the lumbar plexus. The Deep layer of superficial fascia is more membranous than the superficial layer, and will be best seen by raising it from the deep fascia beneath, beginning about four inches below the groin and reflecting it on to Poupart’s ligament. Between the two is the saphena vein, and the deeper layer of superficial fascia will be found bound down to the point at which the vein disappears, the saphenous opening. The deep layer of superficial fascia does not pass over Poupart’s ligament like the superficial layer, but is bound down to the fascia lata just below it, thus helping to direct a large femoral hernia along the groin. The Deep fascia of the thigh (fascia lata) is now exposed, and is to be dissected as far as is necessary for the study of the parts concerned in femoral hernia, the several nerves piercing it being left for subse- quent examination. Femoral Hernia. [The saphena vein is seen to disappear through an opening in the fascia lata about an inch and a half below Poupart’s ligament. ThisTHE FEMORAL SHEATH. 87 is tlie saphenous opening, which is obscured by the attachment of a portion of the superficial fascia, called from the numerous perfora- tions in it cribriform. If the cribriform fascia be carefully removed together with the small veins, the artificially produced saphenous opening will then be clearly seen.] The Saphenous opening (Fig. 39, o) varies considerably in dif- ferent subjects, and is generally best seen in the female. It is an oval opening half an inch wide, produced by a splitting and folding of the fascia lata at this point; the outer edge of the opening being formed by the iliac portion of the fascia which is attached to the whole length of Poupart’s ligament, whilst the inner and deeper part is formed by the pubic portion of the fascia lata which, passing beneath the femoral vessels, binds down the pectineus muscle and is attached to the pectineal line. The outer border, which can be made sharp and semicircular with the scalpel, is known as the falci- form or sickle-shape margin (process of Burns), and over the lower part of this the saphena vein passes to open into the femoral vein. The superior extremity of the margin, where it joins Poupart’s liga- ment and overlies the femoral vessels, is sometimes called Iiey’s ligament. The saphenous opening is the external aperture through which femoral hernia when of large size passes, and might there- fore well be called the external femoral ring, although strictly speak- ing there is in the undissected condition no definite ring, but merely a weak point in the fascia through which the hernia protrudes, pushing before it the cribriform fascia. The position of the thigh has considerable influence upon the condition of the saphenous opening, and its edges will be found to be relaxed when the thigh is flexed and adducted, the position in which the patient is placed when the “ taxis ” is applied for the reduction of a hernia. [An incision is to be made from the lower end of the saphenous opening transversely outwards for two inches, and a corresponding one immediately below Poupart’s ligament, and the piece of fascia thus marked out and including the falciform process is to be reflected to the outer side.] Sheath of the vessels (Fig. 40,7c).—Beneath the fascia lata in the upper part of the thigh will now be seen a delicate fascia, con- taining a little fat and covering the femoral vessels, called the sheath of the femoral vessels. This sheath is a tube, broader aboye than below and becoming gradually lost upon the vessels, the anterior part of which is continuous with the fascia transversalis, and the posterior part with the fascia iliaca of the abdomen, beneath Poupart’s88 FEMORAL HERNIA. Fig. 40. ligament. Three vertical incisions, one in the centre and one at each side ol the tubular sheath, will enable the dissector to see that it is di- vided by two slender septa into three compartments, the femoral artery occupying the outermost, the femoral vein the middle, and the innermost or smallest one being occupied only by a lym- phatic gland. This last divi- . sion of the femoral sheath is the femoral or crural canal. The Femoral or Crural Ring (Fig. 41, 12).—If the finger be passed upwards along the crural canal it will enter the Crural or Femoral Ring beneath Poupart’s ligament, displacing a lymphatic gland and a little piece of subperi- toneal fat, which occupy it and form the septum crurale. The boundaries of the crural ring can be better felt than seen, and are, in front, Pou- part’s ligament, or crural arch (with occasionally a distinct band of fascia transversalis beneath it, called the deep crural arch) ; behind, the ilio-pectineal line and body of the pubes ; externally, the femoral vein separated by the septum ; and internally, the sharp margin of Gimbernat’s ligament. The crural ring is the aperture through which femoral hernia leaves the abdomen, and the point at which strangulation most commonly occurs ; the finger should therefore thoroughly explore it. The Crural or Femoral Canal (Fig. 40) is the canal, half an inch in length, along which femoral hernia descends from the crural ring to the saphenous opening ; but as soon as the hernia has forced its way through that spot, it ascends, owing to the close attachment of the Fig;. 40.—Crural sheath laid open (from Wood ‘ On Rupture ’). a.

In its descent the intestine pushes before it (l) peritoneal sac, (2) sep- tum crurale, (3) femoral sheath, (4) cribriform fascia, (5) superficial fascia and skin. It must not be supposed that the surgeon will meet with these various coverings in ope- rating upon a strangulated femoral hernia, since he usually pays no attention to any of them until he reaches the sac or peritoneum, which is to be recognised by its thin bluish appearance, and by the fluid generally to be seen through its slightly transparent Avail. * Surgery.—Operation for strangulated femoral hernia.

This may be most satisfactorily and safely relieved by cutting cautiously inwards with a hernia knife, so as to notch or divide Gimbernat’s liga- ment ; but if this should not prove sufficient, the sac must be carefully opened [and the stricture divided from within it. The only possible danger which can be met with in the deep inci- sion, is an abnormal distribution of the obturator artery (Figs. 43 and 44), which, if it arise from the epi- gastric artery and wind close to the inner side of the neck of the sac, might be divided and give rise to troublesome haemorrhage. Fortu- nately this vessel, if it exists, is seldom damaged by a cautious use of the knife, and, as it is impossible tc ascertain its presence beforehand, its existence may be ignored in practice. [The cutaneous nerves of the upper part of the front of the thigh are to be examined with the fascia lata, before it is removed to expose Scarpa’s triangle.] The Fascia lata of the thigh is a dense white membrane attached to Poupart’s ligament and the crest of the ilium above, and to the pubes internally, and will be afterwards seen to enclose and support all the muscles of the thigh. Cutaneous nerves (Fig. 45).—The Ilio-inguinal nerve, which emerges from the external abdominal ring, gives one or two small branches to the thigh.

It is very seldom satisfactorily seen unless traced from the lumbar plexus. Fig. 43. Fig. 44. The External cutaneous nerve (3) is to be foimd in a fold of fascia lata close to the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and pierces the fascia at a variable point, to be distributed by an anterior and a pos- terior branch to the outer side of the thigh and part of the buttock. The Middle Cutaneous nerve (5).(from the anterior crural,) pierces the fascia in the upper third of the thigh, and will be afterwards traced as far as the knee. The Internal cutaneous and Long Saphenous nerves are not seen at present. Scarpa’s Triangle. [The fascia lata is to be removed from the hollow below Poupart’s ligament as far as the skin has been reflected, and the muscles, vessels, and nerves thus exposed, are to be as thoroughly cleaned as is possible without disturbing their relations.] Scarpa’s triangle is the space in the upper third of the front of the thigh, containing the first part of the femoral vessels. The base of the triangle is upwards, and is formed by Poupart’s ligament; the outer border is formed by the sartorius muscle, which crosses the thigh obliquely ; the inner border corresponds to the inner margin of Fig. 43.—Irregular origin of obturator artery from epigastric. 1st variety (1 in 4) external to crural ring (from Wood ‘ On Rupture’). Fig. 44.—Irregular origin of obturator artery from epigastric. 2nd variety (1 in 80) internal to crural ring (from Wood ‘ On Rupture ’).92 SCARPA’S TRIANGLE. the adductor longus ; and the apex of the triangle is formed by the meeting of the two above-named muscles. The space has been seen to be covered in by the superficial fascia and fascia lata, and its floor will now be seen to be formed by the psoas and iliacus on the outer side? the pectineus and adductor longus on the inner side, with (in some subjects) a small portion of the adductor brevis between the two. Scarpa’s triangle contains the Tig- 45. upper part of the femoral artery and vein with their branches ; the origin of the profunda artery with its vein ; the anterior crural nerve with some of its brandies ; and the termination of the saphena vein. The saphena vein itself is not one of the contents of the space, since it originally was superficial t.o the fascia lata. The Femoral Artery in Scarpa’s Triangle (Fig. 45, 4). —The femoral arteiy is the con- tinuation of the external iliac 1 artery, and extends from Poupart’s ligament to the opening in the adductor magnus, through which Fig. 45.—Superficial dissection of the front of the thigh (from Ilirschfeld and Reveille). 1.

The part now exposed is that above the sartorins, and is usually nearly half of the whole length of the vessel. When the'thigh is slightly flexed and abducted, the artery runs from a point midway between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine (or a little to the inner side of the centre of Poupart’s ligament), through the middle of the triangle in a line with the promi- nent tubercle on the inner condyle of the femur ; but when the thigh is fully ex- tended it will be seen to wind slightly to the inner side of the limb. This portion of the artery is covered only by the super- ficial fascia and fascia lata, except near Poupart’s ligament, where it has been seen to be enclosed in the femoral sheath. One or two branches of the internal cuta- neous nerve cross the vessel at variable points. Behind the artery from above downwards are, the psoas (with a portion of the femoral sheath and the nerve to the pectineus) ; the pectineus, but separated from the femoral artery by the profunda artery and vein and the femoral vein ; and the adductor longus. To the outer side throughout is the anterior crural nerve, but separated at the upper part by a small piece of the psoas ; and the long saphenous branch is in close relation at the lower part of the space. The femoral vein is to the inner side near Poupart’s ligament, but lower down is behind the artery, forming one of its posterior relations. Surgery (Pig. 46).—From its superficial position the femoral artery can be readily felt during life, and compression may be effected in any part of the triangle, but most satisfactorily against the margin of the pubes. The artery has been tied above the origin of the profunda, through an incision parallel to Poupart’s ligament and half an inch below it, but the vessel is more commonly tied at the lower part of the triangle. The latter operation is readily performed through an incision, from three to four inches long, beginning two inches below Poupart’s ligament and running in the middle of the Fig. 46.—Incisions for tying the femoral artery (from Fergusson’s ‘ Surgery’). Fig. 46.SCARPA’S TRIANGLE. 94. lower part of the space, and in the direction of the limb, which is to he abducted. The incision should be carried at once through the fascia so as to expose the fibres of the sartorius at the lower part of the wound, which are readily recognizable by their oblique direction. The muscle being turned a little outwards, the fibrous sheath of the vessels will be seen, and must be carefully opened with the scalpel, when the artery can be isolated and secured. The needle should be passed from within outwards, great care being taken not to include the vein wThich is behind, or the long saphenous nerve which is to the outer side of the vessel. When the femoral artery above the profunda (common femoral) is tied, the circulation is carried on by the obturator, gluteal and sciatic arteries, which anastomose writh the circumflex and perforating branches of the profunda, and also with the articular branches of the popliteal. When the femoral artery below the profunda (superficial femoral) is tied, the circulation is carried on directly through the branches of the profunda, which anastomose "with the anastomotica magna and the branches of the popliteal, in addition to those anastomoses given above. Branches (Fig. 45).—The small (1) superficial epigastric; (2) superficial circumflex iliac; and” (3) superior external pudic, have been already examined. A larger branch (4) the inferior external pudic, arises ffffm the upper part of the artery and passes beneath the fascia lata to the scrotum or labium and perinamm. The largest branch, (5) the profunda artery, arises from one to two inches below Poupart’s ligament and is now seen lying first to the outer side of, and then behind, the femoral artery and vein, and rest- ing upon the pectineus. It is the great artery to the muscles of the thigh, and will be afterwards dissected. The Femoral vein at the lower part of Scarpa’s triangle lies a little to the outer side of the artery. It then ascends behind it, and after being joined by the profunda vein, lies to the inner side of the femoral artery at the upper part of the space, where it receives the saphena vein and the veins corresponding to the four small branches of the artery. The Anterior Crural Nerve (Fig. 45, 5) is derived from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4tli nerves of the lumbar plexus, and enters Scarpa’s triangle beneath Poupart’s ligament, between the psoas and iliacus muscles. It divides into a superficial and deep part, the superficial giving off the middle and internal cutaneous nerves and supplying the sartorius ; the deep supplying muscular branches, and the longTHE ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE. 95 or internal saphenous nerve, which becomes cutaneous at the inner side of the knee.* [The limb being extended, the line of incision on the inner side of the thigh is to be prolonged to three inches below the knee, and then carried across the limb, when the skin thus marked out is to be reflected to the outer side, and the superficial fascia to the same extent, all the cutaneous nerves being carefully left at their points of emergence from the fascia lata.] The Bursa patella is the subcutaneous synovial sac in front of the knee-cap, which will be seen by making a vertical incision into it. When inflamed, this bursa forms what is commonly known as “house- maid’s knee.” The Fascia lata or deep fascia of the thigh is now thoroughly exposed. It has been seen to be attached to Poupart’s ligament and the crest of the pubes, and can now be followed to the crest of the ilium. The fascia is strongest on the front and outer side of the thigh, and on each side of the prominent extensor muscles may be seen a white line marking the positions of the external and internal intermuscular septa. The fascia blends with the capsule of the knee, and is continued over the patella to the heads of the tibia and fibula, being incorporated with the several tendons attached to those parts. Piercing the fascia lata at several points are the cutaneous nerves of the thigh, some of which have been already seen, but the follow- ing are now to be traced to their distributions and then to their origins, the fascia being removed as may be necessary for the latter purpose. The Internal cutaneous nerve (Fig. 45, 7, 8) is a branch of the anterior crural, and divides at a variable point into two branches, outer and inner. The outer branch frequently perforates the sartorius muscle, which it supplies, and becomes cutaneous in the lower third of the thigh, the branches reaching as far as the patella. The inner branch having crossed the femoral artery appears close to the saphena vein a little above the knee, and its branches unite with those of the other branch and with the internal saphenous [nerve. Occasionally a junction between this nerve and the obturator may be traced on the inner side of the middle of the thigh. The Long or Internal Saphenous nerve (Fig. 45, 16) (the course of which will be afterwards seen) becomes cutaneous at the inner side * This last is often described as coming; from the superficial division, but the above is the more common arrangement.V 96 FRONT OF THE THIGH. of the knee joint, where it lies at first in front of the saphena vein. Before becoming cutaneous it sends a large branch forward to the skin of the patella (ramus cutcmeus patella') (14), which pierces the sartorius, and unites with branches of the internal and middle cutaneous nerves to form what has been called the plexus patella. The Superficial veins of the thigh are very variable, but they either open into the saphena vein separately, or form one or more separate branches which join the main trunk at or near the saphenous opening. Muscles of the Front of the Thigh. [The remains of the fascia lata are to be removed and the cutaneous nerves turned aside. The muscles of the front of the thigh will be put on the stretch by flexing the knee, except the sartorius, which must be stretched with hooks in order to clean it. All the loose fascia is to be removed, and each muscle cleaned in the direction of its fibres, special care being taken to expose clearly the origin and insertion of each.] Connected with the fascia lata on the outer side of the thigh is the Tensor Fasciae or Vaginae Femoris (Fig. 47, 4) which is to be exposed by removing the fascia below the crest of the ilium. The muscle arises from the outside of the anterior superior spine of the ilium and part of the notch between the two anterior iliac spines, and from a small portion of the crest ; and the fibres pass downwards and backwards to be inserted into the fascia lata below the great trochanter, the fascia being split at this point to receive the muscular fibres. The tensor vaginae femoris is, as its name implies, a tensor of the fascia of the thigh, and thereby supports and assists the other muscles of the limb ; it is also an internal rotator of the femur. It is supplied by a branch of the superior gluteal nerve, which may be seen enter- ing the deep surface of the muscle when it is reflected. The Sartorius (Fig. 47, 5) is the longest muscle of the body, and when dissected lies loosely upon the subjacent muscles. It arises from the anterior superior spine of the ilium and from the notch below it, and, crossing obliquely over the thigh, winds to the inner side of the knee and is inserted into the broad and subcutaneous surface below the inner tuberosity of the tibia. The insertion of the sartorius is by a broad tendinous expansion, which is incorporated with the fascia of the limb and overlaps the insertions of the gracilis and semi-tendinosus muscles (of which the latter is the lower one), a bursa intervening between them ; it also sends a slip beneath the other tendons. The sartorius (tailor-muscle) is a flexor of the leg upon the thigh, and a flexor and rotator outwards of the thigh upon97 THE RECTUS FEMORIS. the pelvis, thus crossing the legs, and hence the name. It is supplied by the middle cutaneous branch of the anterior crural nerve. ' The Quadriceps Extensor is the fleshy mass on the front of the thigh consisting of the rectus femoris super- ^ ficially, with the crureus beneath it, and the vastus externus and interims on either side. The Rectus Femoris (Fig. 47, 6) has no attachment to the femur, but stretches over it from the pelvis to the patella. It arises by a double tendinous origin, from the ante- rior inferior spine of the ilium and from the rough depression above the acetabulum, but the outer or reflected tendon cannot be tho- roughly seen at present. The two heads unite to form a fusiform penniform muscle, which is tendinous on its under surface at the lower part, and passes to be inserted into the upper part of the patella in conjunction with the other extensor muscles. Beneath the rectus will be seen the Exter- nal circumflex branch of the profunda artery. This arises from the outer side of the vessel near its origin, and runs transversely between the branches of the anterior crural nerve, upon the vastus externus and beneath the sartorius and rectus femoris, to the outer side of the thigh, where it divides into ascending, transverse, and descending sets of branches. The ascending branches pass beneath the tensor fasciae to anastomose with the gluteal artery ; the transverse set supply the vastus externus, and, turning round the limb, anas- tomose with the perforating branches of the profunda ; whilst the descending branch passes between the vastus Fig;. 47.—Muscles of the anterior femoral region (from Wilson). 1.

The Vastus Externus (Fig. 47, 7) is the largest of three muscles in front of the femur. It arises from the root of the great trochanter and the line leading from it to the linea aspera ; from the outer side of the upper half of the linea aspera and adjacent part of the shaft of the femur ; and from the external intermuscular septum. Its fibres end in a broad aponeurosis which is inserted partly into the outer side of the patella, blending with the rectus, and partly into the head of the tibia, forming a portion of the anterior ligament of the knee joint and being blended with the fascia. The Vastus Interims (Fig. 47, 8) is more or less united with the crureus. It arises from the inner side of the linea aspera and from the adjacent bone as high as the insertion of the iliacus below the lesser trochanter; from the upper half of the inner division of the linea aspera ; and from the internal intermuscular septum. Its tendon resembles that of the vastus externus, and is inserted into the inner side of the patella and the head of the tibia, forming part of the anterior ligament of the knee, and being blended with the adjacent tendons and fascia.^ The origin of the lower part of the muscle cannot be seen quite distinctly at present, since its inner border is united by a piece of fascia with the tendon of the adductor longus to form a tendinous covering to the femoral vessels (Hunter’s canal). The Crureus covers the front of the femur between the two vasti muscles, with the inner of which it is often so united as to form one muscle. It arises from the anterior surface of the femur, from the anterior intertrochanteric line to about four inches from the lower end of the bone, and is inserted into the patella with the other extensor muscles. Its surface is tendinous, to allow free movement of the rectus upon it. The small subcrureus muscle will be best dissected with the knee joint. The quadriceps extensor is the great extensor of the leg upon the thigh, and is therefore in constant requisition in standing and walking. The rectus in addition flexes the thigh upon the pelvis when the leg is fully extended ; also when the leg is fixed it steadies the pelvis upon the femur or draws it forward. The quadriceps extensor is supplied by the anterior crural nerve. Surgery.—These powerful muscles occasionally fracture the patella transversely by their violent and sudden action, the bone being snapped across the condyles of the femur, and the upperFEMORAL ARTERY AND ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE. 99 fragment afterwards drawn up by the contraction of the muscles. In order to relax the muscles and bring the fragment down, it is necessary to ‘ extend the leg upon the thigh and flex the thigh upon the pelvis.’ The Femoral Artery in Hunter’s Canal (Fig. 49).—Hunter’s canal is formed by a tendinous expansion derived from the adductors longus and magnus and the vastus interims, which encloses the femoral vessels and long saphenous nerve in the middle third of the thigh. The canal begins at the crossing of the sartorius muscle and ends at the opening of the adductor magnus, where the artery enters the popliteal space, being covered by the sartorius in its whole length. On laying open the canal, the femoral artery will be found to have its vein behind and to the outer side until it reaches the opening in the adductor magnus ; the saphenous nerve, at first to the outer side, crosses the artery to wind round the tendon and become cutaneous on the inner side of the knee. The Opening in the adductor magnus, as it is commonly called, is in reality an opening between the round tendon of the adductor magnus on the inner side, and the fibres of the vastus internus and the femur on the outer side, the tendinous fibres of the adductor forming the remainder of its circumference. The only structures passing through it are the femoral artery and vein. The Anastomotica magna is the only vessel arising from the femoral artery in Hunter’s canal, but its branches not unfrequently come off at two or more separate places. The anastomotica has a superficial and deep branch : the superficial accompanying the saphenous nerve to the skin, the deep branch entering the vastus internus, through which it descends to the knee to anastomose with the articular branches of the popliteal artery. Surgery (Fig. 46).—Deligation of the femoral artery in Hunter’s canal is not frequently performed in the present day, but the vessel is readily reached by an incision to the inner side of the vastus interims in the middle third of the thigh, by which the outer edge of the sartorius muscle is met with. The sartorius is turned inwards, when the tendinous canal is brought into view, and by laying it open the artery will be exposed. It is more convenient to pass the aneurism needle from without inwards than the reverse, the vein lying to the outer side. The Anterior Crural Nerve (Fig. 49, 5) supplies branches to all the muscles of the front of the thigh except the tensor fasciie femoris, and also gives a branch to the pectineus on the inner side of the limb. The branch to the sartorius has been already seen to arise h 2100 INNER SIDE OF THE THIGH. from the middle cutaneous nerve, and the remaining branches can now be traced from the deep division. The nerve to the vastus internus (19) which arises close to the long saphenous nerve, is some- times (but badly) called the “ short saphenous nerve.” The nerve- to the pectineus (10) crosses transversely beneath the femoral vessels to the surface of the pectineus muscle, and gives a branch to the- front of the hip joint. The Internal Saphenous Nerve (Fig. 49, 22) is the longest branch of the deep division of the anterior crural nerve. It lies close to the outer side of the femoral artery, and enters Hunter’s canal with it; then crossing the artery it pierces the sheath, appear- ing beneath the sartorius at the inner side of the knee. I11 the thigh it gives a communicating branch to the subcutaneous plexus on the inner side, and at the knee its patellar branch pierces the sartorius. The nerve becomes cutaneous between the sartorius and gracilis, and runs down the inner side of the leg. Inner Side op the Thigh. [The superficial muscle of the inner side of the thigh (adductor longus) is already partially seen ; to expose the rest of the region, an incision is to be made along the rami of the pubes and ischium, and the skin is to be reflected, when the gracilis will be brought into view.] A few cutaneous branches of nerve to the skin of the inner side of the thigh will be found appearing below the adductor longus. They are derived from the obturator. The Adductor Longus (Fig. 47, 13) arises by a round tendon from the front of the os pubis immediately below the crest, and expands to be inserted into the middle third of the inner border of the linea aspera. It is supplied by the obturator nerve. The Gracilis (Fig. 49, 26) is the most internal of the muscles of the thigh, and arises by a broad thin tendon from the rami of the pubes and ischium close to the symphysis. It is a long riband-shaped muscle, and is inserted into the inner surface of the tibia beneath the sartorius, but higher than the semi-tendinosus, a bursa intervening between it and the internal lateral ligament of the knee. It is supplied by the obturator nerve. [The adductor longus is to be divided near its origin and turned down, in order to expose the adductor brevis and the insertions of the pectineus and the psoas and iliacus. The branch of the obturator nerve to the muscle is to be preserved, and the profunda vessels are to be cleaned as far as exposed, with the deep muscles,]101 THE PROFUNDA ARTERY. The Pectineus (Fig. 47,12) has been already seen in relation with the femoral artery and forming part of the floor of Scarpa’s triangle. It arises from the upper part of the triangular surface immediately in front of the ilio-pectineal line, and slightly from the line itself, and winds to the hack of the femur to he inserted into the line lead- ing from the trochanter minor to the linea aspera, a bursa intervening. It is supplied by the anterior crural nerve. [The pectineus should be divided and turned aside, in order to bring the deeper parts into view.] Insertion of the Psoas andlliacus.—The muscles form a single tendon, along the inner border of which, however, muscular fibres are continued for its whole length. The insertion of the tendon is into the back of the lesser trochanter, and the muscular fibres are prolonged for a short distance below that point. The Adductor Brevis (Fig. 49, 18) has the superficial division of the obturator nerve lying upon it, and the deep division of the same nerve appearing between it and the adductor magnus. It arises from the front of the pubes below the adductor longus and between the gracilis and obturator externus, and is inserted into the whole of the line leading from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera behind the pectineus. It is supplied by the obturator nerve. The action of the adductors is implied by their name, but they act at the same time as external rotators of the thigh. The power of adduction can be carried beyond the middle line so as to cross the thighs over one another. The pectineus is an adductor and a flexor of the thigh, and the gracilis is in addition a flexor of the leg. All the muscles of the inside of the thigh are supplied by the obturator nerve except the pectineus, which receives its nerve from the anterior crural. The Profunda Artery (Fig. 48) has been seen to arise from the femotal artery in Scarpa’s triangle about two inches below Poupart’s ligament. It lies at first to the outer side of the femoral artery and against the iliacus and psoas, but then winds inwards on to the pectineus behind the femoral artery, which is separated from it by both the profunda and femoral veins. The profunda next winds between the borders of the pectineus and adductor longus and lies against the adductor brevis ; then passing behind the adductor longus, it runs on to the adductor magnus, where it ends. The profunda vein is superficial to its artery in the whole of its course.INNER SIDE OF THE THIGH. 102 Adductor Magnus .... The Branches of the Profunda are the external and internal circumflex, three perforating arteries, and a terminal branch, besides branches to the muscles on the inside of the thigh. 1. The External circumflex artery arises from the outer side of the profunda near its origin, and has been already seen in the dissection of the thigh (p. 97). 2. The Internal circumflex artery (Fig. 48) arises from the inner side of the profunda near its origin, and passing beneath the pectineus, reaches the obturator externus muscle above the adductor brevis, when it divides into two ter- minal branches. One passes superficially to the adductor brevis, to supply the muscles on the inner side of the thigh; the other passes beneath the adductor brevis, and after giving a branch to the liip- j oint, ends in a branch which will be found between the quadratus femoris and ad- ductor magnus in the dissec- tion of the buttock. 3. The Perforating arteries (Fig. 48) which are three in number, pierce the adductor muscles to reach the ham- strings, which they supply on their deep surfaces. The upper and middle arteries perforate the adductors brevis and magnus ; the lowest arises below the level of the adductor brevis, and therefore perforates only the adductor magnus. The nutritious artery to the femur generally comes from the middle perforating artery, and when enter- ing the foramen in the linea aspera has a direction from the knee- joint. 4. The Terminal branch (Fig. 48) ends in the fibres of the adductor magnus. Fig. 48.—Diagram of the profunda artery of the thigh (drawn by J. T. Gray). Fig. 48. Femoral Artery Psoas and Iliacus ..

[The adductor brevis is to be divided m order to expose the deep portion of the obturator nerve, the adductor ruagnus, and the obtu- rator externus, which are to be cleaned.] The Profunda Vein receives branches corresponding to those of the artery and ends in the femoral vein, being superficial to the pro- funda artery throughout. The Obturator Nerve (Fig. 49, 8) is the last branch of the lumbar plexus, being derived from the third and fourth lumbar nerves. It leaves the pelvis at the upper part of the obturator foramen with the obturator ar- tery, and immediately divides into superficial and deep por- tions. The superficial division lies upon the adductor brevis and supplies the adductor longus, Fig. 49.—Nerves of the thigh (from 1. Gangliated cord of sympathetic. 2. Third lumbar nerve. 3.

The deep division pierces the obturator externus and lies on the adductor magnus, both of which it supplies, and gives an articular branch through the adductor magnus to the back of the knee, which affords one explanation of the pain referred to the knee in disease of the hip-joint. An Accessory obturator nerve is occasionally found passing from the third and fourth nerves of the lumbar plexus over the pubes beneath the pectineus. When this exists it more or less replaces the super- ficial division of the obturator nerve. The Adductor Magnus (Fig. 49, 20) arises from the lower part of the descending ramus of the pubes ; from the ascending ramus of the ischium ; and from the lower part of the tuberosity.

[The gluteus is to he divided near its origin and turned down, when its attachment to the sacro-sciatic ligament above and the fascia below will be better seen. Some branches of the superlicial gluteal artery at the upper, and of the sciatic at the lower part of the muscle must necessarily be divided, but the nerves going to its under sur- face from the small sciatic should be preserved if possible.] Three bursce will be found in connection with the gluteus maximus ; one between its fascia and the great trochanter ; a second between the fascia and the vastus externus ; and the third over the tuberosity of the is- chium, which is remarkable for its change of relation to the muscle ; since when the body is in the erect posture the muscle covers the tuber and its bursa, but when in the sitting posture, the muscle slips back and the bursa becomes subcutaneous. The Parts beneath the Gluteus Maxi- mus (Fig. 52) can now be seen, although covered by loose cellular tissue which is to be afterwards removed. They are from above downwards 1, gluteus medius ; 2, super- ficial gluteal vessels ; 3, pyriformis muscle ; 4, sciatic vessels and nerves (great and small); 5, pudic vessels and nerve, and nerve to obturator internus ; 6, tendon of the obturator internus with the gemelli muscles above and below it; 7, tendon of the obturator externus ; 8, cpiadratus femoris and upper border of adductor magnus ; 9, great sacro-sciatic liga- ment ; 10, tuber ischii and muscles attached to it.

In order to clean the muscles, the thigh must be well rotated inwards, and in the case of the gluteus iuedius, it must be crossed beneath the opposite limb.] The Gluteus Medius (Fig. 53, 2) arises from the dorsum ilii between the superior and middle curved lines, and from the fascia covering its anterior part. The fibres converge to be inserted into the outer surface of the great trochanter, extending obliquely from its posterior superior angle downwards and forwards. The anterior border of the gluteus medius is united with the minimus, which lies beneath it. The insertion of the gluteus medius is best seen when the muscle has been divided. [The gluteus medius is to be divided close to its origin without injuring the gluteus minimus, the separation from which is marked by an artery; and the anterior borders of the muscles having been separated with the scalpel, the gluteus medius is to be turned down without injuring the vessels and nerves beneath. A bursa will be found on the great trochanter beneath the tendon.] The Gluteus Minimus (Fig. 52, 8) arises from the dorsum ilii between the middle and inferior curved lines, being united by its anterior border with the gluteus medius. It is inserted into the anterior surface of the great trochanter. The two smaller glutei muscles assist in maintaining the erect posture by fixing the pelvis on the femur, or if the pelvis be fixed, they act as abductors and rotators of the thigh, the gluteus minimus and the anterior portion of the medius rotating inwards, and the posterior portion of the medius rotating outwards. They are both supplied by the superior gluteal nerve. The Pyriformis (Fig. 52, 9) is only partly seen in the dissection of the buttock. It arises from the front of the lateral mass of the sacrum between the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sacral foramina, and often from the great sacro-sciatic ligament; and passing out of the great sacro-sciatic foramen ends in a round tendon, which is inserted into a distinct depression at the posterior part of the upper margin of the great trochanter. The muscle is occasionally divided into two parts by the passage of a portion of the great sciatic nerve through its fibres. The pyriformis is an external rotator of the thigh, and is supplied by brariches of the sacral nerves within the pelvis. In order to see the remaining muscles satisfactorily, the sciatic nerves should be drawn aside over the tuberosity of the ischium. The Obturator Tnternus and Gemelli (Fig. 52, 11).—Only the tendon of the obturator interims is now seen, the muscle arising fromTHE OBTURATOR INTERNUS AND GEMELLI. 109 ■ the inner surface of the pelvis in front of and behind the obturator foramen, and also from the inner surface of the obturator membrane. The tendon winds out of the lesser s'acro-sciatio foramen, and being joined by the gemelli, passes for- wards and outwards beneath the tendon of the pyriformis (with which it is more or less united), to be inserted into a depression at the anterior part of the upper margin of the great trochanter. The gemelli (twin muscles) are placedabove and below the tendon of the obturator internus and are inserted into it, but one or both may be absent; the superior arises from the spine of the ischium and adjacent portion of the lesser sciatic notch ; the inferior arises from the upper and back part of the tifber ischii, and is the larger and more constant muscle. If the tendon of the obturator internus be divided near its in- sertion without disturbing the gemelli, and drawn up from the margin of the sciatic foramen, a large bursa will be found, which, when opened, will be seen to lubricate the under surface of the tendon and the margin of the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. The under surface of the obturator tendon is subdivided into from three to five small tendons, and the margin of the bone is encrusted with cartilage and grooved to corres- pond with these.

The tendon of the obturator externus should appear between the gemellus inferior and the quadratus femoris.110 THE BUTTOCK. The obturator interims and gemelli are rotators outwards of the thigh. The obturator is supplied by a special branch from the upper part of the sacral plexus, which also gives a branch to the superior gemellus ; the inferior gemellus is supplied by the nerve to the quadratus from the sacral plexus. The Tendon of the Obturator Externus (Fig. 53, 12) will be found lying deeply between the inferior gemellus and the quadratus muscle. The origin of the muscle has been already seen (p. 105) and the tendon, after passing through the groove below the aceta- bulum, is inserted into the digital fossa at the root of the great trochanter. The obturator externus is a rotator outwards of the thigh, and is supplied by the obturator nerve. The Quadratus Femoris (Fig. 52, 13), so named from its quad- rilateral shape, arises from the outer side of the tuberosity of the ischium external to the hamstring muscles, and passes horizontally to be inserted on the back of the great trochanter immediately above the adductor magnus, with which it is sometimes continuous. The point of insertion has been termed the ‘ linea quadrati ’ (though a distinct line seldom if ever exists at the spot), which must not be confounded with the well-marked posterior inter-trochanteric line. The quadratus femoris is an external rotator of the thigh, and is supplied by a special branch from the sacral plexus, which also gives a twig to the gemellus inferior. The Gluteal Artery (Fig. 53, 3) is a branch of the posterior division of the internal iliac artery, and emerges from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen above the pyriformis. It appears at the lower border of the gluteus minimus, and divides into a superficial and a deep portion. The superficial division is distributed to the under surface of the gluteus maximus ; the deep subdivides into superior and inferior branches. The superior deep gluteal artery runs along the middle curved line of the ilium between the gluteus medius and minimus, both of which it supplies, and ends at the anterior border of the ilium by anasto- mosing with the superior branch of the external circumflex artery of the thigh. The inferior deep gluteal artery crosses the gluteus minimus to the great trochanter, to supply the parts in its neighbour- hood, and end in the tensor vaginae femoris. Venae comites accompany the branches of the artery and open into the internal iliac vein. The Sciatic Artery is a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery, and emerges from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen below the pyriformis. It gives large inferiorwhich pierces the great sacro- Hirschfeld and Leveille). Ill Fig. 53. 1. Gluteus maximus. THE SCIATIC ARTERY. 2. Gluteus medius. 4. Gluteus minimus. 9.

The veins corresponding to the sciatic artgry open into the internal iliac vein. The Pudic Artery is only seen in its course over the spine of the ischium, as it winds out of the great sacro-sciatic foramen below the pyriformis, to re-enter the pelvis by the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen above the tendon of the obturator internus. The artery is accom- panied by its vein and by two nerves, the pudic nerve lying to its inner side and the nerve to the obturator internus to its outer side. A branch of artery will be found both at the upper and lower borders of the quadratus. The upper is a branch of either the in- ternal circumflex or obturator arteries accompanying the tendon of the obturator externus, and the lower, which is more constant, is one of the terminal branches of the internal circumflex artery. The Gluteal Nerve (superior) (Fig. 53, 3) is a branch of the lumbo-sacral cord, and emerges from the pelvis with the gluteal artery above the pyriformis. It divides into two branches, which lie between the gluteus piedius and minimus and supply them, the lower one going forward to the tensor fascia} femoris. The Small Sciatic Nerve (Fig. 53,8) is one of the main branches of the sacral plexus, and appears at the lower border of the pyrifor- mis to become the cutaneous nerve at the back of the thigh. As soon as it emerges from the pelvis it gives cutaneous branches to the skin over the gluteus maximus, and inferior gluteal branches to the under surface of the muscle itself. It then gives cutaneous branches to the thigh, one of the largest of which winds below the tuberosity of the ischium to the perinaeum, and is called the inferior 'pudendal or nerve of Soemmering; and the nerve itself may be traced as far as the pop- liteal space. The Great Sciatic Nerve (Fig. 53, 16) is the largest trunk of the sacral plexus, and appears at the lower border of the pyriformis (or occasionally through its fibres). It runs midway between the tuber- osity of the ischium and the great trochanter, and disappears beneath the hamstring muscles. Properly speaking this nerve gives no branches in this region, but frequently the nerves to the quadratus and hip-joint are derived from it instead of from the sacral plexus itself. The Nerve to the Obturator Internus (Fig. 53, 5) arises from the upper part of the sacral plexus, and leaves the pelvis below the pyriformis, taking the same course as the pudic vessels and nerve over the spine of the ischium, but lying to their outer side. As it winds into the lesser foramen it gives a branch to the superior gemellus, and then supplies the fibres of the obturator within the pelvis.113 THE POPLITEAL SPACE. The Nerve to the Quadratus (Fig. 53) arises from the anterior surface of the sacral plexus, and passes with a branch from the sciatic artery beneath the obturator intemus tendon to the cjuadratus and inferior gemellus. It lies against the back of the hip-joint, to which it gives a branch. The Pudic Nerve (Fig. 53, 7) from the sacral plexus, is seen lying on the spine of the ischium internal to the pudic artery. If the inferior hoemorrhoidal nerve should happen, to arise separately from the sacral plexus, it will be found accompanying the pudic in this position. The dissection of the popliteal space should be made before the skin on the back of the upper part of the thigh is removed, so that the re- lations of the parts in the ham may be undisturbed. The Popliteal Space. [A vertical incision is to be made in the middle line of the limb at the back of the knee, extending for six inches above and the same distance below the joint. A transverse incision at each end of this will allow the skin to be fully reflected. A few branches of the small sciatic nerve may be found in the superficial fascia, which is to be re- moved in order to expose the deep fascia.] Deep or Popliteal Fascia.—This is continuous with the fascia lata, being strengthened by the hamstring tendons, and stretches across the popliteal space to protect the vessels and nerves beneath. When the limb is extended it is tightly stretched, but is at once relaxed on bending the knee. The fascia being removed, the hollow of the ham will be brought into view filled with loose fat, which is to be removed to expose the popliteal vessels and nerves. Imbedded in the fat of the popliteal space are some lymphatic glands, and it may be noted that there are no glands in the limb below this point. The boundaries of the space are to be carefully cleaned, care being taken, at the lower part, of two small nerves and a vein which run on the back of the leg. The Popliteal Space (Fig. 54) is a lozenge-shaped cavity at the back of the knee, which in the dissected state extends for some dis- tance above and below the joint. Its upper part is bounded externally by the tendon of the biceps ; internally by the tendons of the semi- tendinosus and semi-membranosus muscles, with the gracilis and sar- torius more superficially. Its lower part has one of the fleshy heads of the gastrocnemius muscle on each side, and on the outer side there is, in addition, the small plantaris muscle. The floor of the space is formed at the upper part by that portion 1114 THE POPLITEAL SPACE. of the back of the femur which is between the divisions of the linea aspera ; next by the posterior ligament of the knee-joint; and at the lower part by the popliteus muscle and the fascia covering it. These Fig. 54. I-. 15 17 16 ' last can only be felt between the heads of the gastrocnemius, but if the inner head of that muscle be divided near its origin and turned down, the popliteus will be sufficiently displayed.

The Internal Popliteal Nerve (Fig. 54,4) is the most superficial of the important structures in the ham. It is one of the divisions of the great sciatic nerve, and passes with a very slight degree of obliquity from the outer to the inner side of the ham, extending through the whole length of the space and disappearing beneath the gastrocnemius muscle. It thus crosses from the outer to the inner side of the popliteal artery, which it accompanies to the lower border of the popliteus muscle. Its branches are (1) articular, which pierce the posterior surface of the knee-joint and accom- pany the inferior internal and azygos articular arteries ; (2) muscular to the gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris, and popliteus ; and (3) the external saphe- nous nerve or ramus communicans tibialis, which lies in the groove between the heads of the gastrocne- mius (sometimes beneath a few of its fibres), and will be traced in the dis- section of the back of the leg. The External Popliteal Nerve or Peroneal (Fig. 55, 8), the other division of the great sciatic, is alto- gether under cover of the biceps at the upper part of the space, but be- comes visible close to its tendon near the head of the fibula. It gives a com- municating branch (ramus communi- cans peronei veljibularis) down the 'back of the leg to join the external _ j, — ■ - Fig. 55.—Deep dissection of the popliteal space (from Hirsehfeld and Leveille. 1.

The Popliteal Artery (Fig. 55, 5) is the continuation of the femoral artery, and extends from the opening in the adductor magnus to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it divides into anterior and posterior tibials. It lies at the bottom of the popliteal space, resting upon the back of the femur, the posterior ligament of the knee, and the popliteus muscle; and has a direction from the inner side of the femur to the middle of the leg. Its vein lies super- ficially in its whole course, but first to its outer side and afterwards to its inner side, whilst the internal popliteal nerve is still more superficial, and also crosses the artery from without inwards. The commencement of the popliteal artery is under cover of the semi- membranosus, the middle of the vessel is in the hollow of the 'ham, uncovered by muscles, and its lower part is beneath the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles. A branch of the obturator nerve may be found on the upper part of the artery, and traced to the back of the knee. The Branches (Figs. 54 and 55) of the popliteal artery are muscular (both to the hamstrings and muscles of the calf) and articular. 1. The Superior muscular branches arise from the upper part of the artery', and are distributed to the adjacent hamstring muscles. 2. The Articular branches are five in number, viz., two superior, two inferior, and one azygos. The superior arteries, internal and external, arise just above the condyles of the lemur, around which bone they wind to the front of the knee-joint, to supply it and to anastomose with the anastomotica magna and the descending branch of the profunda respectively. The inferior articular arteries arise on the popliteus, and do not correspond on the two sides of the limb. The internal (the lower of the two) winds below the inner tuberosity of the tibia and beneath the internal lateral ligament ; the external passes altogether above the head of the fibula but beneath the external lateral ligament, to the front of the joint. The azygos arises about the middle of the artery and pierces the posterior ligament to join the other branches. 3. The Inferior muscular branches (sural) are distributed to the muscles of the calf. Surgery.—The popliteal artery may be readily compressed by the hand or a tourniquet. The operation of tying the popliteal artery for aneurism is never performed, but it might be necessary to reach the vessel if wounded ; in which case an incision to the inner side of the space would enable the operator to reach the middle of the artery without injury to the nerves.117 THE BACK OF THE THIGH. The Popliteal Vein (Fig. 55, 3) is formed by the junction of the anterior and posterior tibial veins at the lower border of the popliteus. The vein lies superficially to the artery, and to its inner side at the lower part of the space, but crosses to the outer side above. It receives branches corresponding to those of the artery and, at a variable point, the external saphena vein, which lies on the back of the leg between the heads of the gastrocnemius, opens into it. Some lymphatic glands are placed close to the artery, into which lymphatics, from the back of the leg, discharge themselves. The Back op the Thigh. [The skin left on the back of the thigh is to be removed, and the small sciatic nerve traced as far as convenient, after which the fascia should be removed, and the hamstring muscles, with the sciatic nerve, cleaned.] The Hamstring Muscles (Figs. 53 and 54) are three in number, viz., the biceps on the outer side, and the semi-tendinosus and semi- membranosus on the inner side. The biceps and semi-tendinosus, which arise in common, are superficial to the semi-membranosus near the tuber ischii, and the semi-tendinosus maintains this relation to the semi-membranosus throughout. The short head of the biceps will be found on the outer side of the lower part of the femur. The Biceps (Fig. 53,19) or outer hamstring arises by its long head from the anterior or lower of the two surfaces on the tuber ischii, in common with the semi-tendinosus, and from the great sacro-sciatic ligament. It crosses the great sciatic nerve and, by diverging from the semi-membranosus in the lower fourth of the thigh, forms the outer boimdary of the popliteal space. The short head (20), which is fleshy, arises from the outer side of the linea aspera as high as the insertion of the gluteus maxinnis, and from its outer division to within two inches of the condyle, and from the external inter-mus- cular septum. The two heads having united opposite the lower end of the femur, the muscle is inserted into the outer side of the head of the fibula. The tendon splits to enclose the long external lateral ligament, and one portion of it therefore intervenes between the long and the short external lateral ligaments of the knee-joint (Fig. 54, 2). The Semi-tendinosus (Fig. 53, 19) arises by fleshy fibres in common with the tendinous origin of the biceps, from the anterior of the two surfaces on the back of the tuber ischii. It forms one of the inner boundaries of the popliteal space, and ends in a long118 BACK OF THE THIGH. slender tendon, which lies on the semi-memhranosns and passes beyond it to be inserted into the anterior or inner side of the tibia below the inner tuberosity, lying beneath the tendon of the sartorius and below that of the gracilis. Its fibres are crossed by a tendinous intersection (Fig. 54, 3). The Semi-membranosus (Fig. 53, 21), though one of the internal hamstrings, is external to the biceps at its origin. It arises by a strong tendon from the posterior or upper surface on the tuber ischii, and, passing beneath the origins of the biceps and semi-tendinosus, spreads into a broad tendon from which the muscular fibres arise to form a thick belly. It is inserted by a strong tendon, which passes horizontally beneath the internal lateral ligament of the knee to the groove in the side of the inner tuberosity of the tibia, and gives off two expansions, one to form the posterior ligament of the knee-joint, and the other to cover the popliteus muscle (Fig. 54, 5). The hamstring muscles flex'the leg upon the thigh, and then extend the thigh upon 4he pelvis, as in walking or running ; their most important action, however, is when the leg is their fixed point, and they then prevent the pelvis and trunk from falling forward, and thus maintain the erect posture of the body. When, taking the pelvis as their fixed point, they act upon the leg or (the knee being fixed) upon the thigh, their power is applied to a lever of the third order ; when taking their fixed point below they act upon the pelvis, their power is applied to a lever of the first order. The hamstrings are supplied by the great sciatic nerve. The Great Sciatic Nerve (Fig. 53, 16) is continued from the buttock and, after leaving the quadratics femoris, lies on the posterior surface of the adductor magnus, to which it gives a branch, and passes beneath the biceps. At a variable point, but generally about the middle of the thigh, the nerve divides into the internal and external popliteal trunks, which have been already traced. Muscular branches to the hamstring muscles are given off by the nerve in this part of its course. Beneath the sciatic nerve will be seen the posterior surface of the adductor magnus, and piercing it at various points are the termina- tions of the perforating arteries from the profunda, which are now seen to supply the hamstring muscles («. p. 102). The termination of the internal circumflex artery, between the quadratus and adductor magnus can now also be more fully traced out. [Before the subject is re-turned, the gluteus minimus, pyriformis, and obturator internus should be turned aside, and the back of the hip-joint dissected, but the joint itself should not be opened. Oppor-119 THE HIP-JOINT. trinity should now be taken to trace the reflected tendon of the rectus fenioris, arising from a depression above the acetabulum. When the subject is replaced on its back, the front of the joint is also to be dissected by removing the psoas and iliacus and the remains of the pectineus, after which it may be opened and the limb removed.] Fig. 56. The Hip-Joint is the best example in the body of enarthrosis or ball-and-socket joint, and of necessity has a capsular ligament besides other internal ligaments. The hip-joint has in front the united psoas and iliacus muscles, and Fig. 56.—Section through the hip and gluteal region (altered from Beraud) 1. Gluteus maximus. 2. Gluteus medius. 3.

The hip- joint admits of the movements of flexion, extension, abduction and adduction, rotation and circumduction. Flexion is performed by the psoas and iliacus, and indirectly by the rectus femoris : extension by the gluteus maximus, and indirectly by the hamstrings. The femur is adducted by the adductor muscles and pectineus, which at the same time rotate the bone outwards ; it is abducted by the gluteus medius, minimus, and tensor vaginae femoris. Rotation outwards is due to the gluteus maximus and the posterior fibres of medius and minimus, to the psoas, iliacus, pyriformis, obturator and gemelli muscles, and quadratus femoris ; rotation inwards to the anterior fibres of the gluteus medius, the gluteus minimus and tensor vaginae femoris. The Capsular Ligament (Fig. 58, 8) when seen from behind, will be found to be attached to the margin of the acetabulum, but to reach only about halfway down the posterior surface of the neck of the femur, the point to which it reaches varying in different subjects. In front, the capsule extends from the margin of the acetabulum to the anterior inter-trochanteric line, and is strengthened by an oblique band of fibres extending from the anterior inferior spinous process to the anterior inter-trochanteric line, to which the name ilio-femoral ligament has been given (Fig. 41, 9). The inferior attachment of the ilio-femoral liga- ment is more or less by two divergent slips, into the upper and lower extremities of the anterior inter-trochanteric line, thus form- ing what Professor Bigelow has called the Y-ligament (Fig. 57). The inner slip limits especially extension and rotation inwards ; the outer slip rotation outwards and adduction of the femur, and both have an important influ- ence on the production of the several forms of dislocation of the head of the femur. A bursa intervenes between the tendon of the psoas and the front of the hip-joint, which occasionally communicates with the synovial cavity through the capsular ligament. It should be noticed that the posterior part of the capsular liga- Fig. 57.

The anterior part is put on the stretch in abduction of the thigh, and the ilio-femoral band serves to prevent the head starting from the cotyloid cavity, hence the rarity of dislocation forwards. The capsular ligament having been divided, the thigh will be seen to be held by the so-called ligamentum teres, which will be brought into view hy abducting and everting the limb. In doing this a squeaking noise will probably be heard, which is due to the sudden separation of the moist articular surfaces of the femur and pelvis, Fig. 58. which are covered with cartilage. The inter-articular ligament (teres) being divided, the limb can be removed. The single synovial membrane of the joint will be seen to be reflected over the inner surface of the capsular ligament on to the neck of the femur, and to be prolonged over the ligamentum teres to the bottom of the acetabulum, which it lines. In the bottom of the cavity it is Fig. 58.—Ligaments of the pelvis and hip-joint (from Wilson), 1. Oblique sacro-iliac ligament. 6. Cotyloid ligament. 2. Great sacro-sciatie ligament. 7.

It is attached above to the non-articular portion of the acetabulum by two slips, which reach the margins of the notch in the cotyloid cavity, and below to the pit in the head of the femur. This ligament, though it would assist in preventing absolute dislocation, particularly forwards, has but little effect upon the movements of the joint, since it has been shown conclusively that it is only put irpon the stretch during flexion, adduction, and rotation outwards of the thigh. The Cotyloid Ligament (Fig. 58, 6) is a fibro-cartilaginous ring, thinner at its free-edge than at the point of attachment, which is fixed to the brim of the cotyloid cavity and serves to deepen it, fitting closely also against the head of the femur. That part of it which is carried across the notch on the inner side of the margin of the aceta- bulum is called the transverse ligament, and beneath it the articular vessels pass to the interior of the joint. The Back of the Leg. [A vertical incision through the centre of the remaining portion of skin on the back of the leg, joined by a short transverse cut at the heel, will permit the reflection of the skin to each side.] The External Saphenous Nerve (Fig. 59, 8) (communicans tibialis) will be found piercing the deep fascia of the leg about half- way down the limb, to join the communicans fibularis (4) which becomes cutaneous near the knee. The nerve thus formed runs along the outer side of the tendo Achillis, and passes behind the external malleolus to the outer side of the foot. A branch or two of the interned saphenous nerve (7) may be found on the inner side of the back of the leg. The External Saphena Vein (Fig. 59, 6) appears behind the external malleolus close to the saphenous nerve, and running up the centre of the leg, pierces the deep fascia at the point where the com- municans tibialis nerve emerges ; it has been already traced to the popliteal vein. The saphena vein not unfrequently runs superficially to the upper part of the popliteal space before it joins the popliteal vein. [The deep fascia of the leg, which is continuous with that of the thigh, is to be removed, except near the internal malleolus, where the internal annular ligament is to be preserved. The muscles of the calf are then to be dissected, being put on the stretch by supporting the knee and drawing the toes towards the front of the leg.]123 THE PLANTAEIS. Fig. 59. The Gastrocnemius (Fig. 60, 4), the superficial muscle of the calf, has a double-headed origin from the back of the femur imme- diately above the condyles, both heads being firmly attached to the capsule of the knee-joint. A bursa, sometimes communicating -with the knee-joint, lies between the inner head and the tendon of the semi-membranosus. The two heads are the lower boundaries of the popliteal space, and unite to form one large muscle, the fibres of which end about the middle of the leg in a broad tendon, which contracts near the heel into the thick rounded tendo Acliillis (6). This, which is the common insertion of the gastrocnemius and the subjacent soleus, expands again slightly, to be inserted into the lower part of the posterior surface of the calcaneum, a bursa intervening between it and the upper part of the same bone. [The remaining head of the gastro- cnemius being carefully divided near its origin, and the muscle turned down as far as possible, the plantaris and soleus, vdth the popliteus covered by its fascia, will be brought into mew.] The Plantaris (Fig. 54, 12) arises from above the external condyle of the femur and from the line leading to it from the linea aspera, the muscle lying internal to the outer head of the gas- trocnemius. Its fleshy fibres are about Fig. 59.—Superficial nerves of the back of the leg (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Internal popliteal nerve. 2. External popliteal nerve. 3. Internal saphenous vein. 4.

The Tibialis Posticus (Fig. 61, 8) is the only one of the deep muscles which is attached to both bones of the leg, between which it therefore lies, its tendinous surface forming septa between it and the adjacent muscles. It arises from the posterior surface of the tibia, below the oblique line and external to the flexor longus digitorum, to within two inches of the ankle ; from nearly the whole length of the interosseous membrane ; and from the whole of the internal surface of the fibula immediately behind the interosseous line,* as well as from the intermuscular septa on each side, which are continuous with the aponeurosis over it. The muscle is overlapped by the flexor digitorum, and between the tibial and fibular- origins the anterior tibial vessels pass. The fibres end in a single broad tendon, which passes beneath and then to the inner side of that of the * The internal surface here spoken of is not the sur- face called internal by Cloquet, Oruveilhier, Wilson, and Holden, which includes the surface in front of the inter- osseous line,—nor that considered internal by Ward and Gray, which extends from the interosseous line to the posterior border of the bone; but is the surface existing only in the middle of the bone, between the interosseous line and an oblique line which cuts it off from the posterior surface. The fibula may be best considered as having a quadrilateral shaft with anterior, external, posterior, and internal (partial) surfaces. This view has been recently adopted in Mr. Wagstaffe’s “ Osteology,” and the new edition of “ Quain’s Anatomy.” Fig. 61.—Deep layer of muscles of the back of the leg (from Wilson). 1.

The lower fibres, forming an almost distinct muscle, end in a round tendon which is inserted into the tubercle above the inner condyle of the femur, and, by means of an expansion, into the lower part of the line leading to it. It is this tendon which bounds the “ opening in the adductor magnus.” The muscle is supplied by the obturator nerve, and also by the great sciatic. Above the upper border of the adductor magnus a portion of the Obturator Externus can be seen. It arises from the margin ot the anterior half of the obturator foramen, and from the corresponding portion of the outer surface of the obturator membrane. The fibres are directed backwards, and end in a tendon which passes in a groove below the acetabulum, to be inserted into the digital fossa of the femur, as will be seen in the dissection of the buttock. The obturator externus is an external rotator of the thigh and is supplied by the obturator nerve. The obturator artery is best seen after the removal of the thigh from the pelvis, in the dissection of which it is included. The Buttock. [The body being turned on its face, the buttocks are to be raised by blocks beneath the pelvis until the thigh can be well Hexed with the knee on the table, or, if preferred, the legs may be allowed to hang over the end of the table.] The dissector should recognise the crest of the ilium, which will bound his dissection superiorly, also the sacrum and coccyx, and the tuberosity of the ischium, which can be felt through the gluteus maximus. The relation of the trochanter to the several parts of the pelvis in the different positions of the limb is to be noted also, as being of great practical importance in the diagnosis of fractures and dislocations. The “fold of the buttock” formed by the lower border of the gluteus maximus will be seen when the muscle is stretched by rotating the thigh inwards, but will vary according to the muscular development of the subject. The prominences of the inner and outer hamstrings and the hollow of the ham will be readily seen, and it should be noted how much deeper the space appears when the knee is flexed, and how readily, under these circumstances, the popliteal vessels can be felt, owing to the relaxation of the fascia. [An incision is to be made along the crest of the ilium and downTHE BUTTOCK. 106 the. middle of the sacrum to the tip of the coccyx, when, if the perinseum and thigh have been dissected, it will only he necessary to make another cut across the upper part of the hack of the thigh to allow the large flap of skin to he reflected outwards.] The amount of fat beneath the skin of the buttock varies consider- ably, and if there is a large quantity it will he a waste of time to look for cutaneous nerves. The Cutaneous Nerves are descending and ascending. The descending branches will he found passing over the middle of the crest of the ilium, and are the iliac branches of the last dorsal and first' lumbar (ilio-hypogastric) nerves, the former being in front of the latter. There are a few branches also derived from the pos- terior divisions of the lower lumbar and upper sacral nerves, which pass obliquely from near the middle line. The ascending branches turn round the lower border of the gluteus maximus, and are branches of the lesser sciatic nerve. [The portion of deep fascia covering the gluteus medius and seen in front of the gluteus maximus is to be cleaned, and then the gluteus maximus itself, the fibres being put on the stretch by flexing and inverting the thigh, and the dissector beginning at the upper border of the muscle on the right, and its lower border on the left limb.] The Gluteus Maximus (Fig. 51, 2) arises from the rough triangle between the posterior third of the crest of the ilium and the superior curved line on the dorsum ilii ;* from the side of the lower part of the sacrum, and the side of the coccyx ; from the tendinous expansion over the back of the sacrum ; and from the surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, which will be seen when the muscle is divided. The fibres run downwards and outwards, and the upper two-thirds of the muscle are inserted into the fascia lata covering the great trochanter (ilio-tibial band), the lower third being attached to the rough ridge leading from the back of the trochanter major to the linea aspera of the femur, and into the fascia as well. The gluteus maximus is one of the most important muscles for maintaining the erect position of the body, by fixing the pelvis upon the thigh. When the pelvis is the fixed point, the muscle is a powerful extensor of the thigh, and at the same time rotates it outwards. It is supplied by the inferior gluteal branches of the small sciatic nerve. * In describing the glutei fnuscles the dorsum ilii is considered to have three curved lines, and not two as given by some authors.THE POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. 127 flexor digitorum at the ankle, running through a groove at the hack of the internal malleolus and in the most internal division of the annular ligament to the sole of the foot, where it is attached to the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone and gives slips to all the other bones of the tarsus, except the astragalus, and to the three middle metatarsal bones. The Flexor Longus Pollicis (Fig. 61, 9) is a well-marked penniform muscle, arising from the posterior surface of the fibula below the origin of the soleus to within an inch of the ankle ; and also from the intermuscular septa between it and the peronei muscles on the outer side of the bone, and the tibialis posticus internally. The muscle ends in a tendon which lies to the outer side of the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, and, passing through a separate division of the annular ligament, winds to the sole of the foot through an oblique groove at the back of the astragalus and another below the lesser process of the os calcis. The flexor longus pollicis and flexor digitorum are direct flexors of the toes and extensors of the foot, i.e., they point the toes. The tibialis posticus is also an extensor of the foot, which it tends to draw inwards. The three muscles are supplied by the posterior tibial nerve. Surgery.—The form of club-foot called ‘talipes varus; which causes the patient to walk on the outside of the foot, is due in part to the contraction of the tibialis posticus and sometimes of the flexor digitorum. The operation of dividing these tendons is performed immediately above the internal malleolus, a blunt-pointed tenotomy knife being used after the first incision, to avoid all danger of wound- ing the posterior tibial artery. 1 The Posterior Tibial Artery (Fig. 63, 21) is the direct con- tinuation of the popliteal artery, and begins at the point of bifurca- tion of that vessel, which is usually the lower border of the popliteus muscle. In the upper part of its course the posterior tibial artery lies between the superficial and deep muscles of the back of the leg, but below the origin of the soleus it is only bound down by the intermuscular layer of fascia, and lies by the side of the tendo Achillis. It rests upon (in the position for dissection) the tibialis posticus for two-thirds of its length, but then upon the flexor digitorum ; and at the ankle lies upon the tibia between the tendons of the flexor digitorum and flexor longus pollicis. The vessel after- wards passes through a division of the annular ligament to the interval between the inner malleolus and the heel, where it divides into internal and external plantar arteries. The posterior tibial nerve has a close relation to the artery throughout, lying first to its128 BACK OF THE LEG. inner side and then crossing to its outer side, in which relation it con- tinues to the foot. The posterior tibial artery has two vence comites, which join those of the anterior tibial artery to form the popliteal vein. Surgery (Fig. 62).—The operation of tying the posterior tibial artery is seldom performed except on the dead body, but the vessel may be reached in three parts of its course. Behind the malleolus Fig. 62. the artery is readily exposed by a semi-lunar incision two inches long, made three-quarters of an inch behind the margin of the bone, the edge of the knife being directed towards the tibia so as to divide the internal annular ligament. At the lower part of the leg the vessel may be reached by a vertical incision a little to the inner side of the tendo Achillis, and will be found lying upon the flexor digitorum. In the middle of the leg the operation is one of some difficulty and somewhat damages the dissection if performed. The best mode of proceeding is to make a vertical incision four inches long, parallel to, and half an inch behind, the edge of the tibia; the gastrocnemius slips aside and the soleus is then to be divided, especial care being taken to cut through the tendon on its under surface, but to go no deeper. A little dissection, close beneath this tibial attachment and towards the fibula, will expose the posterior tibial artery lying upon the tibialis posticus, with the posterior tibial nerve to its outer side. The Branches (Fig. 63) of the posterior tibial artery are (1) peroneal; (2) muscular branches ; (3) nutritious to the tibia; (4) a communicating branch ; and (5) internal calcanean. Fig. 62.—Incisions for tying the posterior tibial artery (from Eergusson’s “ Practical Surgery ”).THE POSTERIOR' TIBIAL ARTERY. 129 1. The Peroneal (12), always of considerable size and sometimes larger than the posterior tibial, comes off about two inches below the popliteus. It lies first between the tibialis posticus and flexor longus pollicis, but afterwards pierces the fibres of the flexor pollicis and runs close to the fibula to near its lower end. In this part of its course it gives muscular branches, and the nutri- tious artery to the fibula, which runs from the knee-joint. It then gives a good-sized anterior peroneal branch to the front of the leg between the tibia and fibula below the interosseous mem- brane, which will be afterwards dis- sected ; and a communicating branch to join that from the posterior tibial. The peroneal artery ends below the ex- ternal malleolus by anastomosing with the malleolar and plantar arteries. 2. Muscular branches are given to the deep muscles and also to the soleus.

A Communicating branch runs transversely immediately above the ankle, to join a corresponding branch of the peroneal artery. 5. The Internal Calcanean is a branch of variable size and may be replaced by two or more separate arteries. It arises from the posterior tibial whilst beneath the internal annular ligament, which it pierces to supply the inner side of the os calcis with the muscles attached to it, and to anastomose with the other arteries in the neighbourhood. The Posterior Tibial Nerve (Fig. 63, 19) is the continuation of the internal popliteal trunk, and passes with the artery beneath the soleus to lie on the deep muscles of the back of the leg. It is placed at first to the inner side of the posterior tibial artery, but crosses that vessel in the upper part, and lies to its outer side at the ankle in the same division of the annular ligament. The nerve divides into internal and external plantar nerves for the sole of the foot, and the division not unfrequently takes place above the inner malleolus, in which case the plantar nerves are usually found on either side of the artery. The posterior tibial nerve gives muscular branches to the tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, and flexor longus pollicis; and a cutaneous nerve to the heel (20), which pierces the fascia to the inner side of the tendo Aehillis, and may be traced to the skin of the sole of the foot. Parts behind the Inner Malleolus (Fig. 64).—Although the several parts behind the internal malleolus are only continuations of those which have been already dissected, especial notice should be Fig. 64.—Belation of parts behind the inner malleolus (from Hirsehfeld and Leveille). 1. 1.

A portion of the skin on the inner side of the heel and sole of the foot is to he reflected if necessary, so as to expose the whole breadth of the internal annular ligament, which stretches from the inner malleolus to the os calcis and gives origin by its lower border to one head of the abductor pollicis. The divisions in the annular ligament are four in number, and are occupied as follows, beginning from the tibia. In the first division is the tibialis posticus ; in the second the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum; in the third the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, though this nerve is generally divided; and in the fourth the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis,* but this last lies so deeply in order to pass in the grooves in the astragalus and os calcis that it is not readily seen from the side. Each of the tendons is lubricated by a distinct synovial membrane (Fig. 65). The Sole of the Foot. [The foot being raised on a block so that the sole may be fully exposed, an incision is to be made down its centre from the heel to the bases of the toes, the knife being carried at once down to the glistening plantar fascia through the thick lobulated fat which is always found beneath the skin in this region. A transverse incision at the roots of the toes will allow the skin and fat to be reflected to each side, which may be readily accomplished if the knife is kept close to the fascia and parallel to its fibres. Near the toes care must be taken of the divisions of the plantar fascia and of the digital nerves which appear between them ; but no attempt need be made to trace out * Artificial Memory ; Timothy Does Vex All Very Nervous Pupils (tibialis, digitorum, vein, artery, vein, nerve, pollicis).

The Plantar Fascia (Fig. 66, 2) closely resembles the fascia of the palm, and is divisible into three portions. The central, which is the strongest, is attached to the under surface of the great tuber- osity of the os calcis, but expands as it passes forwards to nearly the entire width of the foot. It splits into five portions opposite the heads of the metatarsal bones, and at this point distinct trans- verse fibres will be seen passing across the foot. The five processes are attached to the sheaths of the flexor tendons of each toe, and between them the several digital vessels and nerves pass. A transverse ligament has been described in the skin of the web of the toes, passing over the digi- tal vessels and nerves. This is hardly worthy of a special de- scription, as it is merely a slight extra development of the cutis, e plantar fascia.

The central portion of the fascia gives origin to muscular fibres by its deep surface, and also by two intermuscvdar septa which will subsequently be seen on each side of the flexor brevis digitorum. The lateral portions of the plantar fascia are much thinner than that in the centre, and mainly cover the muscles of the great and little toes on the inner and outer sides of the foot, but there is also a strong band on the outer side running from the outer tubercle of the calcaneum to the base of fifth metatarsal bone. [The central portion of the fascia is to be cut across about two inches from the heel, and may then be turned down over the toes without injuring the digital nerves, when the flexor brevis digitorum will be exposed in part, and the intermuscular septa on each side may be seen. The lateral portions of the fascia are to be removed, and the abductor pollicis and abductor minimi digiti cleaned.] The First Layer of Muscles consists of the flexor brevis digi- torum in the middle, the abductor pollicis to the inner side, and the abductor minimi digiti to the outer side. The Flexor Brevis Digitorum (Fig. 67, 5) arises from the great tuberosity of the os calcis ; from the plantar fascia covering it (which has therefore been left undisturbed); and from the intermuscular septa on each side. It divides into four tendons, which pass through tendinous sheaths on the under surfaces of the foul smaller toes, and are inserted, each by two slips, into the bases of their second phalanges. Passing between the subdivisions of each tendon is the corresponding tendon of the long flexor, which goes to the terminal phalanx ; and thus the arrangement is precisely similar to that found in the hand, and the flexor brevis might be spoken of as perforatus, and the flexor longus as perforans. The sheaths of the tendons also resemble those of the hand, but are smaller. Beginning over the heads of the metatarsal bones, each sheath is joined by a process of plantar fascia (which splits to be attached to each side of it), and then extends to the base of the terminal phalanx. The sheath is strong opposite each phalanx (liga- mentum vaginale), but thinner over the joints, so as not to impede their motion ; and when divided, will be found to be lined by a synovial membrane which is reflected over the tendons, and from which bands (vincula vasculosa) connecting the tendons with the sheath are derived. Small elastic bands (ligamentco brevia) connecting each tendon of the flexor brevis with the front of the first phalanx exist as in the hand. The Abductor Pollicis (Fig. 67, 3) arises from the internalSOLE OF THE FOOT. 134 annular ligament, from the greater tuberosity of the os calcis (internal to the origin of the flexor brevis digitorum), and slightly from the plantar fascia. The muscle ends in a broad tendon, which is joined by the inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis, and is inserted into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe. The Abductor Minimi Digiti (Fig. 67, 4) arises from the lesser tuberosity of the os calcis ; from the greater tuberosity in front of Fig. 67. Fig. 68. Fig. 67.—First layer of muscles 1. Os calcis. 2.

Its tendon is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the little toe * The actions of the superficial muscles of the foot are sufficiently- indicated by their names, but it should be remarked that abduction and adduction are from and to the median plane of the foot and not of the body. The flexor brevis digitorum and abductor pollicis are supplied by the internal plantar nerve ; the abductor minimi digiti by the external plantar nerve. [To bring the deeper parts into view, the best way will be to remove with the saw a thin slice of the os calcis, including the attach- ments of the superficial muscles, when, if the attachment of the abductor pollicis to the internal annular ligament be divided, they can be turned forwards, and the plantar nerves and vessels will be seen.] The Plantar Arteries (Fig. 68) internal and external, are the terminal brandies of the posterior tibial, and enter the foot beneath the abductor pollicis in close relation with the plantar nerves. The internal plantar artery, which is the smaller of the two, is accompanied by the large internal plantar nerve, the large external plantar artery going with the smaller external nerve. The Internal plantar artery (6) is usually of small size, and runs forward to the great toe, where it gives digital arteries to the great and one side of the second toe, and anastomoses with the dorsal artery of the foot. If well-injected it may sometimes be traced with the nerve to the third interosseous space, giving muscular branches and digital branches to the three inner toes. Two vence comites accompany it. The External plantar artery (7) runs obliquely outwards across the foot between the flexor brevis digitorum and the accessorius muscle, and turning round the outer border of the latter muscle, takes a deep course inwards towards the great toe, where it will be subse- quently traced. It is accompanied by the external plantar nerve, which also gives a deep branch across the foot, and by vence comites; and supplies the adjacent muscles, giving a branch to the outer side of the foot to anastomose with the peroneal artery. The Plantar Nerves (Fig. 69) internal and external, are the * Mr. John Wood has described an abductor ossts metatarsi quinti, which is occasionally found beneath the abductor and attached to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone.136 SOLE OF THE FOOT. branches of the posterior tibia! nerve ; their relation to the arteries has been mentioned. The Internal plantar nerve (5) supplying the abductor pollicis Fig. 69. is the larger of the two, and after and flexor brevis digitorum, gives off a digital branch to the inner side of the great toe, and breaks up into three other digital branches ; each of these bifur- cates at the roots of the toes, and they thus supply the outer side of the great toe, both sides of the second and third toes, and half the fourth toe. The nerve also gives muscular branches to the flexor brevis pollicis and the two inner lumbricales muscles, and cutaneous branches to the sole. The External plantar nerve (3) crosses the foot with and in front of the external plantar artery, giving branches to the abductor minimi digiti and ac- cessorius in its course. At the outer border of the accessorius i divides into superficial and deep portions, the deep accompanying the artery. The superficial por- tion supplies the flexor brevis minimi digiti and the interosseous muscles in the fourth or oute- most space, and gives cutaneous branches to the sole.

A slender branch of communication between the internal and external plantar nerves may sometimes be found. It may be noticed that the nerves of the sole of the foot closely resemble those of the palm of the hand in their distribution, the internal plantar corresponding to the median, and the external plantar to the ulnar nerve ; the deep branches of the latter nerves also correspond. The Second Layer of Muscles includes the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum and flexor longus pollicis, with the small accessorius and lumbricales muscles, all of which should now be cleaned. The tendon of the Flexor Longus Digitorum (Fig. 70, 3) is single at the annular ligament and lies to the inner side of the vessels and nerves, but it will now be seen to cross beneath them and over the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis to the centre of the foot, where it has the fibres of the accessorius attached to its deep surface. It then divides into four tendons, which give origin to the lumbricales muscles and pass beneath the digital nerves to the four small toes, where they enter the digital sheaths, lying beneath (the tendons of the short flexor. Each deep tendon then passes through the slit in the superficial tendon, and is inserted into the base of the third 01 terminal phalanx. The Accessorius (Fig. 69, 8) arises from the under surface of the os calcis by two heads, between which the long plantar ligament is seen. The inner head, which is fleshy and the larger of the two, is attached to the hollow in front of the greater tuberosity ; the outer head, which is tendinous, is attached to the bone in front of the lesser tuberosity and to the long plantar ligament. The muscle is inserted into the deep surface of the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, or rather, is connected with it, and then sends slips to the tendons con- nected with the second, third, and fourth toes. The Lumbricales (Fig. 67, 7) are four small muscles, which are so named from their fancied resemblance to earth-worms. They arise from the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum,—the most internal from one, and the rest from two tendons each,—and wind to the inner sides of the four small toes to reach their dorsal aspects, where they join the expansions of the extensor tendons. The action of the accessorius is to bring the line of traction of the flexor tendons into the centre of the foot. The use of the lumbricales is doubtful, but according to Duchenne is similar to that of the138 SOLE OF THE FOOT. interossei. The accessorius is supplied by the external plantar nerve ; tlie two inner lumbricales by the internal plantar, and the two outer lumbricales by the external plantar nerve. The tendon of the Flexor Longus Pollicis (Fig. 70, 4) after lying in the groove below the lesser process of the os calcis, runs forward to the great toe, lying beneath the plantar vessels and nerves, and being crossed by the tendon of the flexor digitorum, to which it is connected by a few fibres. The tendon lies between the two heads of the flexor brevis pollicis and then enters a sheath, in which it is enclosed until its insertion into the base of the terminal phalanx of the great toe. [The long tendons and the accessorius muscle are to be cut about the middle of the foot and turned down, when the muscles of the third layer are to be cleaned.] The Third Layer of Muscles consists of the flexor brevis pollicis, adductor pollicis, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and transversus pedis. The Flexor Brevis Pollicis (Fig. 70, 5) arises by a narrow tendinous origin from the under surface of the external cuneiform bone and adjacent surface of the cuboid, and is connected with the insertion of the tibialis posticus. Its fibres form two heads, which diverge from each other and separate near the head of the metatarsal bone, to be inserted into opposite sides of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe with the abductor and adductor respectively. Each head has a sesamoid bone developed in its tendon, entering into the formation of the metatarso-phalangeal joint, which must be opened to see them distinctly. The tendon of the long flexor lies between the two heads of this muscle. Fig. 70. Fig. 70.—Third and part of the second layer of muscles of the sole of the foot (from Wilson). 1.

The Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti (Fig. 70, 7) arises from the under surface of the projecting base of the fifth metatarsal bone and the sheath of the peroneus longus, and is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the little toe with the abductor.* The Transversus Pedis (Fig. 70, 8) is of variable size, and con- sists of three or four small bundles, which arise from the transverse metatarsal ligament over the heads of the three or four outer meta- tarsal bones. It is inserted into the outer side of the first phalanx of the great toe with the adductor and part of the flexor brevis pollicis. The action of the flexor brevis pollicis and flexor minimi digiti is obvious; the adductor pollicis acts towards the median plane of the foot, and the transversus draws the toes together and narrows the foot. The flexor brevis pollicis is supplied by the internal plantar nerve, the other muscles by the external plantar nerve. [The adductor and flexor brevis pollicis are to be cut near their origins and turned down, when the plantar arch of the external plantar artery with the accompanying nerve is to be fully traced out.] The External Plantar Artery (Fig. 68, 8) after turning round the accessorius muscle takes a deep course beneath the adductor and flexor brevis pollicis, but upon the interosseous muscles, to the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. This deep portion of the artery has been called the plantar arch, which is completed by the communicating branch of the dorsal artery of the foot entering the sole between the first and second metatarsal bones. Branches.—Three small posterior perforating arteries are given off by the plantar arch, which pierce the interosseous muscles to anasto- mose with the interosseous arteries on the dorsum. Four digital arteries arise from the anterior part of the arch ; the outer one goes to the outer side of the little toe, the others bifurcate to supply the adjacent sides of two toes each, and at the point of bifurcation send anterior perforating arteries to the back of the foot. The digital arteries run on the sides of the toes with the digital nerves, and anastomose in the pulp of the terminal phalanx. The communicating branch of the dorsalis pedis artery enters the * An opponens minimi digiti attached to the metatarsal bone may occasionally be found.140 FRONT OF THE LEG AND FOOT. sole between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and besides completing the plantar Fig. 71. The Superficial Veins form arch, gives off the arteria magnet pollicis, which bifurcates to sup- ply the adjacent sides of the great and next toe ; and also a small branch to the inner side of the great toe. The External Plantar Nerve (Fig. 71, 5).—The deep portion of the nerve accompanies the artery beneath the adductor pollicis, in which it ends. In its course it gives small branches to the two outer lumbricales, to the transversus pedis, and to all the interosseous muscles both plantar and dorsal, except those of the fourth or outermost inter- osseous space, which are supplied by the superficial portion. The Fourth Layer of Muscles consists of the plantar interossei, which will be better seen when the dorsal interossei are dissected. Fkont of the Leg and Foot.

The internal saphena vein is to he traced in front of the internal malleolus to the inner side of the knee. Cutaneous Nerves.—On the outer side of the leg are a few cutaneous branches from the external popliteal nerve. The Musculo-Cutaneous Nerve (Fig. 75, 13) pierces the deep fascia about the lower third of the outer side of the leg, and at once divides into two branches, which however often appear at different points. The internal division (15) gives branches to the inner side of the great toe, the outer side of the second, and the inner side of the third toe ; frequently also giving a small branch to join the anterior tibial nerve between the first and second toes. The outer division (17) supplies the outer side of the third toe, both sides of the fourth, and either one or both sides of the fifth toe. The External Saphenous Nerve (Fig. 75, 21) winds round the external malleolus from the back of the leg, and is distributed to the outer side of the little toe ; or occasionally to both sides of the little toe and half the next, joining the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The Anterior Tibial Nerve (Fig. 75, 16) appears in the interval between the great and the second toes, the adjacent sides of which it supplies, often joining with a branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The Internal Saphenous Nerve lies in front of the internal malleolus with the saphena vein, which it accompanies. It may be traced along the inner side of the foot, but is of small size. The Fascia of the Leg is dense and white, and is attached to the tibia on the inner side and to the fibula on the outer side, forming an intermuscular septum between the extensor and the peroneal muscles. It gives origin to muscular fibres at the upper part of the leg, where it should therefore be allowed to remain undisturbed ; the rest of the fascia should be removed, except a thickened band over the ankle joint, the anterior annular ligament. The anterior annular ligament consists of two parts, one passing from the tibia to the fibula, and having a compartment for the tibialis anticus distinct from the rest of the structures passing beneath it; the other reaching from the os calcis to the inner malleolus and the inner row of tarsal bones, and having three compartments for (1) the tibialis anticus, (2) extensor proprius pollicis, and (3) extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius, the anterior tibial vessels and nerve going beneath the ligament. A similar band between the external malleolus and the calcaneum is called the external annular ligament, and encloses142 FRONT OF THE LEG AND FOOT. Fig 72. the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis in one sheath. The muscles, vessels, and nerves are to be cleaned. The Extensor Muscles (Fig. 72) are tibialis anticus to the inner side ; the extensor longus digitorum with an extra slip (the peroneus tertius) to the outer side ; and between the two, the extensor proprius pollicis appearing about the middle of the leg. The Tibialis Anticus(Fig. 72,3)arises from the upper two-thirds of the outer surface of the shaft of the tibia and from its outer tuberosity ; from the inner half of the interosseous ligament for the same distance; and from the fascia covering the muscle. The fibres end in a broad tendon, which becomes narrower near the ankle and passes through the most inter- nal division of the annular ligament, to be inserted into the under surface of the internal cuneiform bone and the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The tibialis anticus is a flexor of the foot and draws up its inner side. It is one of the tendons which helps to produce the form of club-foot called ‘ talipes varus.’ It is supplied by the anterior tibial nerve. The Extensor Longus Digitorum (Fig. 72, 4) arises from the upper three- fourths of the anterior surface of the fibula (see note, p. 126), and for about an inch from the adjacent interosseous mem- brane ; from the outer tuberosity of the tibia close to the tibialis anticus ; from the fascia upon the upper part of the muscle ; and from the inter- Fig. 72.—Muscles of the front of the leg (from Wilson). 1.

The mus- cular fibres are continued upon the tendon to the annular ligament, through the outer division of which it passes, and at once divides- into four tendons for the four smaller toes. The insertion of the extensors into the toes is similar to that of the extensors of the fingers, but on a smaller scale. The extensor tendons form an expansion on the back of the first phalanx of each toe, which is joined by the tendons of the corresponding lumbricalis and interossei muscles, and in the case of the second, third, and fourth toes, by the tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum ; this is continued forwards, the central triangular portion going to the second phalanx and the lateral stronger pieces to the third phalanx. The action of the extensor longus digitorum is principally to flex and abduct the foot, since it only extends the first phalanges of the toes, by means of short fibres connecting each tendon with the corresponding bone (Fig. 73, 3). The expansion on the second and third phalanges is connected with the interossei and lumbricales, which are the extensors of the second and third phalanges. (Compare the description of the fingers, p. 51.) The Peroneus Tertius (Fig. 72, 6) is often a part of the extensor longus digitorum. It arises, below the extensor, from the lower fourth of the anterior surface of the fibula ; slightly from the interosseous membrane ; and from the septum between it and the peroneus brevis. Its tendon passes through the same division of the annular ligament as the extensor digitorum, and is inserted into the upper surface of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. The Extensor Proprius Pollicis (Fig. 72, 5) appears between the tibialis anticus and the extensor digitorum in the lower third of the leg. It arises from the middle two- fourths of the anterior surface of the fibula, behind the ex- tensor longus digitorum; and from the adjacent part of the interosseous membrane. Its tendon passes beneath the an- nular ligament, and, crossing the anterior tibial artery, is inserted into the terminal phalanx of Fig. 73.—Insertion of extensors of toes (from Duchenne). 1. Extensor proprius pollicis. 3. Fibrous bands from— 2. Fibrous bands passing to first 4. Extensor longus digitorum. phalanx of great toe. Fig. 73.FRONT OF THE LEG AND FOOT. 144 the great toe, being closely connected with the first phalanx, of which it is the special extensor (Duchenne), by short fibrous bands (Fig. 73, 2). The extensors of the toes also act secondarily as flexors of the foot, i.e., bend it upwards. The peroneus tertius assists in this latter action. The rare form of club-foot ‘ talipes calcaneus ’ is produced by the action of these muscles. They are all supplied by the anterior tibial nerve. The Extensor Brevis Digitorum (Fig. 72, ii) is the only muscle of the back of the foot. It arises from the upper surface of the greater process of the os calcis ; from the calcaneo-astragaloicl ligament; and from the lower border of the anterior annular liga- ment. It ends in four tendons, which pass obliquely across the foot to be inserted into the four inner toes, joining the general expansion of the extensor tendons, except on the great toe, where the tendon is inserted separately into the base of the first phalanx after crossing the dorsal artery of the foot. The extensor brevis is supplied by the anterior tibial nerve. The Anterior Tibial Artery (Fig. 75, 2) is a branch of the popliteal, and enters the front of the leg between the tibia and fibula through the interosseous membrane. Its direction is from a point midway between the outer tuberosity of the tibia and the head of the fibula to the centre of the instep. The artery lies at first upon the interosseous membrane between the tibialis anticus and extensor longus digitorum, and then between the tibialis anticus and extensor proprius pollicis ; but in the lower part of the leg it winds on to the tibia, and becomes superficial above the ankle-joint between the tendons of the tibialis anticus and extensor proprius pollicis. It then passes beneath the annular ligament and is crossed by the extensor proprius pollicis, after which it changes its name to dorsal artery of the foot. Two venae comites accompany the artery; the anterior tibial nerve lies to its outer side as far as about the middle of the leg, then crosses it, and in most cases again gets to its outer side at the ankle. Surgery (Fig. 74).—The anterior tibial artery may be readily tied above the ankle, by an incision three inches long upon the outer side of the tendon of the tibialis anticus and parallel to it. The artery will be found upon the front of the tibia between the tendons of the tibialis anticus and the extensor proprius pollicis, with the nerve to its outer side. The artery may also be reached on the dead body in the upper part of its course, but it lies so deeply between muscles that the145 THE DORSALIS PEDIS ARTERY. operation is seldom, if ever, undertaken on the living subject. As there is no definite guide to the outer border of the tibialis, it is well to make the incision a little obliquely and not less than four inches long, beginning about one inch below the head ot the fibula, at a point midway between the bone and the outer tuberosity of the tibia. The fascia should be di- vided in the same direc- tion as the skin, when, if the fore-finger is intro- duced into the wound, it will probably pass into the cellular interval between the two muscles, there being no intermuscular septum or white line to guide the operator, though these are commonly men- tioned. The tibialis anti- cus and extensor digitorum must be drawn apart, when the artery will be found upon the interosseous membrane with the nerve to its outer side. Branches of the anterior tibial artery:— The Recurrent branch arises as soon as the artery reaches the front of the leg, and winds through the fibres of the tibialis anticus to the front of the knee to anastomose with the articular arteries. Muscular branches to the adjacent muscles arise at various points. The Malleolar arteries, internal and external, the latter being the larger and more constant, pass beneath the tendons to the malleoli, in the neighbourhood of which they are distributed. The external anastomoses with the anterior peroneal artery. The Anterior Peroneal branch of the peroneal artery (page 129) appears between the tibia and fibula through an opening in the lower part of the interosseous membrane, running beneath the peroneus tertius to the outer malleolus to supply it, and to anastomose with the external malleolar artery. The Dorsalis Pedis Artery (Fig. 75, 12) is the continuation of the anterior tibial from the annular ligament to the base of the meta- Fig. 74.—Incisions for tying the anterior tibial artery and the dorsal artery of the foot (from Fergusson’s “Practical Surgery”).146 FRONT OF THE LEG AND FOOT, Fig. 75. tarsal bone of the great toe, opposite which it divides into the com- municating branch to the sole of the foot and the dorsal artery of the great toe. Its direction is from the centre of the instep to the first interosseous space, and it lies at first superficially between the tendons of the extensor proprius pol- licis and the extensor longus digitorum, but is crossed near the point of bifurca- tion by the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum. The artery lies upon the bones of the tarsus and their dorsal ligaments, and has the anterior tibial nerve to its outer side. Two vence comites accompany the vessel. Surgery (Fig. 74). The dorsal artery may be tied in the upper part of its course by an incision on the outer side of, but parallel to, the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis. It occasion- ally happens, however, that the artery is displaced to the middle of the foot beneath the tendons of the extensor digitorum. . 75.—Deep dissection of the front of the leg (from Hirschfeld and Leveille).

Branches of the dorsalis pedis artery. The Tarsal artery arises immediately below the annular ligament, and crosses the foot beneath the extensor brevis digitorum to anas- tomose with the arteries about the external malleolus. The Metatarsal artery arises lower than the preceding and near the bases of the metatarsal hones. It also runs outwards beneath the extensor brevis digitorum, and gives off three interosseous branches to the outer spaces. These run forward upon the interossei muscles, and bifurcate at the roots of the toes to supply the adjacent sides of two toes each, the outer one giving off a branch also to the outer side of the little toe. The anterior and posterior perforating arteries of the plantar arch join these interosseous arteries at their origins and points of bifurcation. The Communicating branch passes between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle to the sole of the foot, where it joins the plantar arch (p. 139). The Dorsalis Pollicis (yel hallucis) artery runs forward upon, the great toe and, after giving a branch to its inner side, bifurcates to supply the adjacent sides of the first and second toes. The Anterior Tibial Nerve (Fig. 75,4) is a branch of the external popliteal nerve, and reaches the anterior tibial artery by piercing the fibres of the extensor longus digitorum. It lies to the outer side cf the artery in the upper part of the leg, but crosses it about the middle, reaching its outer side again at the ankle. Its muscular relations are the same as those of the artery, with which it passes under the annular ligament. In the leg it supplies the four extensor muscles, and as soon as it enters the foot divides into two branches. The outer branch (19) is distributed to the extensor brevis digitorum and the articulations of the foot and ankle joint, having upon it a gangli- form enlargement; the inner branch (16) lies to the outer side of the dorsal artery, and becomes cutaneous in the interval between the great toe and next, the adjacent sides of which it supplies. [The peroneal muscles are to be exposed on the outer side of the leg by removing the fascia covering them, when a strong intermus- cular septum will be found attached to the fibula on each side, sepa- rating them from the muscles of the front and back of the leg. A portion of the fascia is to be left below the malleolus to form an external annular ligament.] The Peroneus Longus (Fig. 72, 7) arises from the upper half of the outer surface of the fibula ; from the intermuscular septa on each side, and from the fascia. It ends in a strong tendon, which lies l 2148 FRONT OF THE LEG AND FOOT. superficially to that of the peroneus brevis behind the external malleolus an£ under the external annular ligament, and the tendon then passes in a sheath of fascia along the outer side of the os calcis to reach the cuboid bone, around which it turns to the sole of the foot. In the sole the tendon lies in the groove of the cuboid bone, and in a fibrous sheath (‘ sheath of peroneus longus ’) which is now to be opened, when the tendon can be traced to its insertion on the outer side of the base of the first metatarsal and internal cuneiform bones. The sheath of the tendon is formed by fibres of the long plantar ligament, and is lined by a synovial membrane. The tendon has a sesamoid cartilage or bone developed in its fibres where it turns round the border of the cuboid bone. The Peroneus Brevis (Fig. 72, 8) lies beneath the tendon of the peroneus longus, and arises from the middle third of the outer surface of the fibula and from the intermuscular septa on each side. It lies upon the lower part of the fibula, and its tendon winds behind the external malleolus, where it is lodged in a groove beneath the tendon of the peroneus longus. It then runs along the outer side of the os calcis in a sheath of fascia in front of the long tendon, and is inserted into the posterior extremity of the fifth metatarsal bone. The peronei act as extensors of the foot, i.e., they point the toes. Both muscles, but especially the peroneus longus, draw up the outer side of the foot, as seen in the form of club-foot called ‘ talipes valgus.’ Both the peronei are supplied by the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The External Popliteal Nerve (Fig. 75, i) is to be followed through the fibres of the peroneus longus, to which it was traced in the dissection of the popliteal space. Before entering the muscle the nerve gives off an external cutaneous branch to the outer side of the knee-joint, and then winding close to the fibula, gives off a recurrent articular branch, which pierces the extensor longus digi- torum to reach the upper part of the tibialis anticus and the front of the knee. It then divides into anterior tibial (4), which pierces the extensor longus digitorum, and musculo-cutaneous (3), which, after giving branches to the peroneus longus and brevis, appears between the peroneus longus and extensor longus digitorum, and finally becomes cutaneous by piercing the fascia in the lower third of the leg. [The tendons on the back of the foot are to be divided or held aside, and the transversus pedis in the sole is to be removed to permit a clear view of all the interossei.] Beneath the transversus will be found the transverse ligament of the metatarsus (Fig. 86, 12) from which its fibres arise, and over which149 THE INTEROSSEOUS MUSCLES. the digital vessels and nerves pass. It connects the heads of the metatarsal bones together and crosses the tendons of the interossei muscles. * The Interosseous Muscles are seven in number, viz. four dorsal and three plantar, the former being strictly between the bones, but the latter lying rather on their tinder surfaces. The dorsal are penniform muscles and are readily seen ; the plantar are a little obscure, owing to the fibres of the dorsal interossei appearing by their sides. The four dorsal interossei (Fig. 77) arise from the adjacent sides of the metatarsal bones in nearly the whole length of their shafts, and A section, of the right leg m the upper third (altered from Beraud).

The three 'plantar interossei (Fig. 78) arise from the inner sides of the third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal bones, and are inserted into the corresponding sides of the first phalanges of the same toes. They thus act as adductors towards the second toe. The interossei are supplied by the deep branch of the external plantar nerve, except those in the fourth space, which are supplied by the superficial part of the nerve. The interossei of the foot should be compared with those of the hand, in which they are a little more complicated owing to their Fig. 77.—The Dorsal Interosseous muscles of the Foot (J. T. Gray).

Though considered anatomically as adductors and abductors, all the muscles by their connection with the extensor tendons are fiexors of the first and extensors of the second and third phalanges (v. p. 143). The Knee-Joint. The knee is a good example of ginglymus or hinge-joint, the move- ment taking place between the femur and the tibia, and the patella gliding upon the former bone. It is remarkable for having inter- articular fibro-cartilages, and its synovial membrane is the most extensive in the body. The knee-joint has in front the expansion of the extensor muscles which help to form its capsular ligament, and in front of the patella is a bursa. Behind the joint are the popliteal artery, vein, and nerves, with the two heads of the gastrocnemius and the popliteus. To the inner side of the j oint, but posterior to it, are the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, semi-tendinosus, and semi-membranosus ; and the biceps occupies a similar position on the outer side. The ligaments of the knee may conveniently be divided into extra- and intra-articular. The Extra-articular Ligaments are anterior, posterior, two lateral, and capsular. The Anterior Ligament (Fig. 79, 3) is the ligamcntum patellce, which is a broad band reaching from the lower margin of the patella to the tubercle of the tibia, and forming part of the insertion of the quadriceps extensor. The expansions of the vasti muscles on each side form an additional covering to the front of the joint and become incorporated with its capsule. Between the ligament and the head of the tibia is a bursa, which must not be confounded with the proper lursa patella: in front of the bone. [To see the remaining ligaments, the popliteal vessels and nerves and the remains of the gastrocnemius and plantaris must be removed. The tendons of the biceps, semi-membranosus, and popliteus are to be traced out fully, and should be carefully preserved, but cut short.] The Posterior Ligament (Fig. 80, 1) (ligamentum posticum Winslowii) is closely connected with the tendon of the semi-mem- branosus, from which a large band of fibres passes obliquely upwards and outwards across the back of the joint, superficially to the fibres of the capsular ligament. The External Lateral Ligament (Fig. 80, 6 & 7) is dividedLIGAMENTS OF THE LEG. 152 into two portions, the long and short, the long being the anterior one of the two. The divisions of the tendon of the biceps embrace the long ligament, and must be divided to expose it thoroughly. It is a round cord attached to the side of the external condyle immediately Fig. 79. Fig. 80. above the depression for the popliteus, and to the outer side of the head of the fibula. The tendon of the popliteus and the external inferior articular artery have been traced beneath it. The short ligament, which is derived from the tendon of the gastrocnemius, is placed behind the long, and reaches from the condyle to the head of the fibula, but it is often very indistinct. The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 79, 5) is a broad band closely connected with the capsular ligament. It is attached to the Fig. 79.—Anterior view of the ligaments of the knee-joint (from Wilson). 1. Tendon of rectus. 2. Patella. 3. Ligamentum patellae. 4. 4.

The Capsular Ligament is a fibrous layer closely connected with the exterior of the synovial membrane and the inter-articular carti- lages, being attached to the margin of the articular surface of the tibia below, and above to the fascia lata and an expansion from the vasti. It blends with the posterior and internal lateral ligaments, and encloses the ligamentum patellae and the external lateral ligament; it is strengthened by expansions from the several tendons, but is pierced by the tendon of the popliteus. [The tendon of the rectus is to be divided and drawn down in order to see the extent of the synovial membrane above the patella, since it reaches for a couple of inches above the articular surface of the femur and gives attachment to the Subcrureus, a small muscle arising from the lower part of the anterior surface of the femur. The synovial membrane is then to be divided on each side, as near the condyles as possible, and the patella turned down, when the ligamenta mucosum et alaria will be seen.] The Ligamentum Mucosum (Fig. 82, io) is a process of synovial membrane attached to the notch between the condyles, from which it stretches to immediately below the patella. The Ligamenta Alaria (Fig. 82, 9) are two folds of synovial membrane with fringed borders, which are seen on each side of the ligamentum mucosum. [The ligamentum mucosum is to be divided and the patella turned down completely, when the bursa of the ligamentum patellae can be opened and seen. The capsular and posterior ligaments are to be removed, but the lateral ligaments are to be preserved and the crucial ligaments dissected.] The Intra-articular Ligaments are the two crucial, the coronary, and the transverse ligaments. Within the joint also are the two semi- limar cartilages. The Anterior Crucial Ligament (Fig. 81, 2) is attached to the external condyle of the femur at its inner and back part, and passes obliquely across the joint to be inserted into the top of the tibia in front of the spine, between the attachments of the internal and external semilunar cartilages, with the latter of which it is closely connected.154 LIGAMENTS OF THE LEG. The Posterior Crucial Ligament (Fig. 81, 3) is broader and stouter than the anterior. It is attached to the internal condyle at its anterior and outer part, and passes nearly vertically to the poste- rior margin of the top of the tibia and popliteal notch, being closely connected with the posterior extremity of the internal semilunar cartilage. The crucial ligaments would alternately check extreme flexion and extension, the anterior ligament becoming tightened when the knee joint is extended, and the posterior when the knee is flexed. If the lateral ligaments are now divided, it will be found that the femur and tibia become more separated than before, showing that the object of the crucial ligaments is not simply to maintain the articular surfaces in apposition. It will also be seen that whilst rotation of the tibia outwards can now be carried to an extreme degree (so as to bring the crucial ligaments almost parallel), rotation inwards is im- mediately checked by the crossing of the ligaments, and it is thus that the tendency of the popliteus muscle to rotate the leg inwards is counterbalanced. The Transverse Ligament (Fig. 81, 4) is a small band connect- ing the anterior extremities of the semilunar cartilages, and often not distinct. The Semilunar Cartilages (Fig. 81) can be partly seen now, but will be fully exposed by dividing the crucial ligaments. They are fibro-cartilages which are thicker at the outer than at the inner mar- gins, and which serve to deepen the condyloid cavities on the top of the tibia, being attached to the margin of the bone by short fibres called the coronary ligaments. The extremities of each cartilage are fixed respectively in front of and behind the spine of the tibia, by short strong bands of fibrous tissue. The Internal Semilunar Cartilage (Fig. 81, 6) is oval in form and embraces the extremities of the external cartilage. Its anterior extremity is attached to the tibia in front of the anterior crucial liga- ment, the posterior extremity is attached in front of the posterior crucial ligament. The External Semilunar Cartilage (Fig. 81, 7) is nearly circu- lar ; its anterior extremity is attached to the tibia immediately in front of the spine, and is connected with the insertion of the anterior crucial ligament. Its posterior extremity is attached to the back of the spine of the tibia, and is connected with the posterior crucial liga- ment by a distinct slip. The tendon of the popliteus is connected with the side of theTHE KNEE-JOINT. 155 external cartilage by a distinct slip, and the tendon of the semi- membranosus similarly with the internal cartilage.

The Synovial Membrane (Fig. 82) extends for at least two inches above the articular surface of the femur, forming a pouch beneath the extensor muscles. It is reflected from the articular surface of the femur over the crucial ligaments to the articular surface of the tibia, covering both aspects of the semilunar cartilages, and then lines the capsular ligament. It gives a tube around the tendon of the popliteus where it is within the capsule, and has already been seen to form the ligamentum mucosum and ligamenta alaria. Tibio-Fibular Articulations. [The whole of the muscular fibres connected with the bones of the leg and foot must be removed, but the tendinous insertions about the foot should be kept to be examined with the ligaments.] The Superior tibio-fibular articulation (Fig. 81) is a simple arthro- dial joint, the synovial membrane of which is occasionally continuous with that of the knee. The anterior and posterior ligaments are short bands connecting the anterior and posterior surfaces of the head of the fibula with the outer tuberosity of the tibia. The Middle tibio-fibular articulation is formed by the interosseous ligament or membrane, which is the great bond between the shafts of the bones of the leg, its fibres running downwards from the tibia to the fibula. It is attached to the sharp interosseous borders of both bones in all their lower parts, a hole being made above by the passage of the anterior tibial vessels. The membrane has an opening in it near the lower part, through which the anterior peroneal artery reaches the front of the leg. Fig. 83.—Posterior view of the ankle-joint (from Wilson). 1.

The Inferior tibio-fibular articulation (Fig. 83) is a simple arthro- dial joint continuous with the ankle-joint. It has anterior and pos- terior ligaments between the two bones resembling those above, and, in addition, placed below the posterior and distinct from it, a trans- verse (or inferior) ligament (3) which reaches from the external malleolus to the posterior surface and malleolus of the tibia, forming part of the true ankle-joint. Ankle-Joint and Articulations of the Foot. The ankle-joint is a hinge joint capable of limited lateral motion when the toes are pointed. It has in front the tendons of the tibialis anticus, the tibial vessels and nerve, the extensor proprius pollicis, and the extensor longus digitorum with the peroneus tertius. Behind, to the inner side are the tendons of the tibialis posticus, the posterior tibial vessels and nerve (or it may he the plantar vessels and nerves); the flexor longus pollicis near the middle ; and to the outer side, the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis (Fig. 65). The ankle-joint has anterior, posterior, and two lateral ligaments. The Anterior Ligament (Fig. 84, 7) is a broad membrane which is seldom seen entire. It is attached to the lower margin of the tibia, and to the superior surface of the astragalus, close to its head and joining the lateral ligament on each side. The Posterior Ligament (Fig. 83, 7) is not described by many authors, and is little more than a few fibres stretching over the syno- vial membrane between the back of the tibia and the astragalus. The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 84, 6) is triangular in shape, and hence has been called deltoid. The apex is attached to the extremity of the internal malleolus, and the base to the posterior part of the astragalus, to the lesser process of the os calcis, and the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone. A strong deep portion passes from the apex of the malleolus to the side of the astragalus. The External Lateral Ligament (Fig. 85) consists of three slips ; two horizontal attached to the astragalus, and one, more or less vertical, to the os calcis. The anterior slip (6) is attached to the front of the external malleolus and to the side of the astragalus in front of the superior articular surface ; the middle (7) is a round cord which reaches backwards from the tip of the malleolus to the outerLIGAMENTS OF THE LEG. 158 side of the os calcis about its middle ; the 'posterior (8) is attached to the deep groove behind the articular surface of the external malleolus, and passes horizontally to the posterior surface of the astragalus behind the articulation with the tibia (Fig. 83, 5). The Calcaneo-astragaloid Articulation has external, posterior, and interosseous ligaments. The external is a short band passing obliquely backwards from the side of the astragalus to the upper margin of the greater process of the os calcis. The posterior is placed between the posterior parts of the two bones, close to the groove in the astragalus through which the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis passes. The interosseous ligament will be seen when the joint is opened. It is a strong thick band, passing from the groove between the two inferior articular surfaces of the astragalus, to the cor- responding groove between the two convex articular surfaces on the superior aspect of the calcaneum.

These must be removed to see the true ligaments of the joints. Ligaments of the Tarsus. On the dorsal aspect of the remaining tarsal bones will be found a number of short bands or fibres which pass between adjacent bones, and have received names as ligaments accordingly. On the plantar aspect there are similar liga- ments, three only of which are worthy of special notice, viz., the long and short calcaneo-cuboid ligaments, and the caleaneo-scaphoid ligament. The Long Calcaneo-Cuboid ligament (Fig. 86, 4)—ligamentum longum plantce—is a broad ligament, which has been already seen in the dissection of the sole of the foot. It is extensively attached to the under surface of the os calcis in front of the tuberosities, and passes forward to be attached to the posterior margin of the peroneal groove in the cuboid bone. Some of the fibres pass on over the tendon of the peroneus (to which they form a sheath), and are attached to the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. The Short Calcaneo-Cuboid Ligament (Fig. 86, 5) lies to the inner side of the long ligament, and is more deeply placed. It reaches from the tubercle on the under surface of the greater process Fig. 86.—Ligaments of the sole of the foot (from Wilson). 1. Os calcis. 2. Astragalus. 3. Tuberosity of the scaphoid hone. 4.

The Calcaneo-scaphoid Ligament is a broad hand of yellow elastic ligament, stretching between the lesser process of the calcaneum {sustentaculum tali) and the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone. It performs the important function of supporting the head of the astrag- alus, which rests upon it, and in this is assisted by the tendon of the tibialis posticus, which passes immediately beneath it. The upper surface of the ligament is covered with the synovial membrane of the astragalo-scaphoid articulation. Numerous interosseous ligaments bind the bones of the tarsus firmly together, and will be seen when the joints are opened. The Metatarsal Bones (Fig. 86, 9) are connected with the tarsus by strong dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments. The dorsal ligaments are one to each metatarsal bone from the tarsal bone with which it articulates ; but the second metatarsal, in addition to its ligament from the middle cuneiform, has extra slips from the internal and external cuneiform bones, between which its base is wedged. The 'plantar ligaments are less regular, and are united with the slips from the calcaneo-cuboid ligament. The interosseous ligaments are short strong bands, and vary slightly in different subjects. There is always one between the internal cuneiform and the second metatarsal bone ; a second may exist between the external cuneiform and the same metatarsal bone ; and a third between the external cuneiform and the fourth metatarsal bone. Transverse dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments connect the bases of the metatarsal bones. The Synovial Membranes (Fig. 87) of the foot, including the ankle-joint, are seven in number, and will be seen by opening the several joints in succession. The 1st is the synovial membrane of the ankle (1), reflected over the upper surface of the astragalus, and upon the ligaments to the articular surfaces of the tibia and fibula ; it passes also between the tibia and fibula into the inferior tibio-fibular articulation. The 2nd synovial membrane lines the posterior calcaneo-astraga- loid articulation (11). The 3rd synovial membrane covers the head of the astragalus and the concave surface of the scaphoid, being prolonged backwards into the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation (in). The strong interosseous ligament connecting the under surface ofTHE SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES OF THE FOOT. 161 the astragalus and the upper surface of the os calcis will now be seen. It is attached to the deep groove found between the two articulations in each bone. An interosseous ligament will also be seen, when the astragalus is displaced, passing from the upper border of the greater process of the os calcis to the cuboid and scaphoid bones. The 4th synovial membrane (xv) is placed between the greater process of the os calcis and the back of the cuboid bone, and, wdien it is opened, the peculiar manner in which the two bones are locked together will be seen. An interosseous ligament will be found between the os calcis and cuboid bone to the inner side of the synovial cavity. The 5th synovial membrane (v) is between the scaphoid and the three cuneiform bones, and will be found to pass between the middle and external cuneiform bones to their anterior surfaces, and the bases of the second and third metatarsal bones (vn). It is also prolonged into the articulations between the second, third, and Fig. 87.—Section to show the seven synovial membranes of the foot (from Wilson). 1. Tibia. 2. Astragalus. 3. Caleaneum. 4.

Interosseous ligaments will be found between the scaphoid and cuboid bones ; between the internal and middle cuneiform bones ; between the middle and external cuneiform bones ; and between the external cuneiform and cuboid bones. The 6th synovial membrane (vm) will be found between the front of the cuboid bone and the bases of the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones, and entering the articulation between the latter. The 7th is a separate synovial membrane (vi) for the first meta- tarsal bone, being placed between it and the kidney-shaped anterior surface of the internal cuneiform bone. Surgery.—The shape of the articulations should be particularly noticed with reference to the several amputations about the foot. At the ankle the astragalus is locked between the projecting malleoli, and it is only by dividing the lateral ligaments, by the side of the astragalus and outside the joint altogether, that the bones can be separated, as in Syme’s or Pirogoff’s amputations. The astragalo-scaphoid and calcaneo-cuboid articulations will be seen to be nearly in the same line, and are easily opened in Chopart’s amputation. The guides for this operation are the tubercle of the scaphoid bone on the inner side, and a point midway between the external malleolus and the fifth metatarsal bone on the outer side, where occasionally a projection may be felt. If, in performing this operation, the articulation in front of the scaphoid should be opened by mistake, the operator would at once see the three articular surfaces for the cuneiform bones, instead of the single globular surface of the astragalus. The operation of disarticulating the metatarsus from the tarsus (Hey’s or Lisfranc’s amputation), is rendered very difficult by the fact that the base of the second metatarsal bone is firmly wedged between the internal and external cuneiform bones, projecting farther into the tarsus than the other bones, and being also attached to the internal cuneiform by a strong interosseous ligament. In ampu- tating at this point therefore, after opening the articulations of the first and three outer metatarsal bones, it is necessary to thrust the point of the knife between the internal cuneiform and second meta- tarsal bones to divide this ligament, or there will be danger of dragging away the internal cuneiform bone. The articulations areTHE METATARSUS AND PHALANGES. 163 placed obliquely, that of the fifth being posterior to that of the first metatarsal bone, the bases of both these bones forming the guides to the surgeon. The articulations between the metatarsal bones and the phalanges, and between the phalanges themselves, are similar to those in the hand, but on a smaller scale, and therefore more difficult of dissec- tion. Reference may be made to the hand for their description. [Vide p. 78.)MUSCLES OF LOWER EXTREMITY.

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. \_Tht Student is requested to read the ‘Introduction ’ before commencing the dissection, unless he has done so previously.] Surgery.—Before the subject is tied up for the dissection of the perinseum, the student should practise the operation of introducing the catheter. In the case of the Male Subject the operator should stand on the left side of the body, and having oiled a perfectly smooth and clean staff or sound, should grasp the end of the penis with the left hand, and draw it upwards so as to stretch the urethra whilst introducing the instrument. The sound is to be held lightly in the right hand, and is to be passed at first along the fold of the groin, but when it has entered the urethra for a few inches it is to be brought parallel to the median line of the body. The introduction of an instrument is more difficult on the dead than on the living body, owing to the want of the mucous secretion of the urethra and the relaxed condition of the canal; and it is advisable therefore to withdraw the instrument and oil it afresh if any obstruction should occur. When an obstruction to entering the bladder occurs, the left hand should be placed upon the perinseum at the point to which the staff has reached, and may be made to grasp the urethra and guide the instrument in its right course. When the point of the staff has passed the bulb, the handle is to be depressed between the thighs, and the point of the instrument will probably enter the bladder. If it is found impossible to depress the handle, the student may be certain that he has failed to pass the triangular ligament, and should be very gentle in his manipulations, or he will very probably perforate the bulb. By a series of very cautious efforts, aided by the left hand on the perinseum, .the staff167 THE PERINEUM. may at least be passed, or if an organic stricture should exist, it will be necessary to use a smaller instrument. When the handle of the instrument can be depressed between the thighs, the student may judge of its having entered the bladder by the readiness with which it passed, and by the ease with which the end of the staff can be rotated in the bladder. In all cases, however, it is advisable for the student to introduce his left fore-finger into the rectum, in order to ascertain that the instrument is not in a false passage, and also in order to appreciate the thickness of the coats of the bladder, the size of the prostate, and the course the catheter would take on the living body. ' In the Female Subject it will be advisable to examine the position of the urethra by separating the labia, before attempting to introduce an elastic catheter. It will be seen that the orifice of the urethra is separated from the clitoris by the space known as the vestibule, and that it is close above the entrance to the vagina. To pass the catheter, the student should stand on the right side of the subject, and having passed the left fore-finger between the thighs and labia, should place it at the anterior edge of the orifice of the vagina; the flexible catheter being then passed along the fore-finger can be slightly raised so as to enter the urethra, and will be felt in its passage through that canal by the finger at tue orifice of the vagina. It will be well to practise the operation once or twice with the parts exposed to view, and then to repeat it with a cloth thrown over the pubes, as would be done in actual practice. The Perineum. [The perinseum is now to be fully exposed by bringing the buttocks of the subject to the edge of the table, where they are to be raised upon a block. The thighs are then to be flexed upon the abdomen, with the legs bent; and the body is to be secured upon the table with a cord passing beneath it from one knee to the other, a block being placed lengthways between the knees to keep them sufficiently apart. The staff is to be retained in the male urethra, and secured in its place by tying a loop of string round the penis, and fastening it to the handle of the staff.] External Appearances.—In the male the skin is of a darker tint than that of the rest of the body, and is more or less covered with hair, which should be removed. In front will be found the scrotum, containing the two testes, and obscuring -at present the root of the penis and deeper portion of the urethra. Behind the1G8 THE PERINEUM. scrotum is the anus or orifice of the bowel, and between the two is the true perinceum, which will be seen to be marked by a median raphe. Around the anus the skin is thrown into folds, which, if enlarged, form one variety of external piles. By drawing the anus slightly open, a white line will be seen, marking the junction of the skin with the mucous membrane, and corresponding to the separation between the internal and external sphincter muscles (Hilton). In the female (Fig. 92) the scrotum may be considered to be split in the median line, to form the two lahia majora, which however consist simply of cellular tissue and fat, and are continuous above' with the mons Veneris, a thickened portion of the integument over the pubes (only partially seen in this view). The labia are united in front by the anterior commissure; they bound the vulva and are continued backwards to the anterior boundary of the perinseum, where they are united by the posterior commissure. In a female who has not borne children, a small transverse fold of mucous membrane may be seen just within the posterior commissure, which is called the fourchette, and between the two is the fossa navicularis. By separating the labia the clitoris will be seen at the upper part of the vulva, resembling a diminutive penis in appearance and struc- ture, and having a small and ill-defined glans and prepuce. The nymphce or labia minora extend obliquely downwards from each side of the clitoris, being connected both with the organ itself and its prepuce, and are lost in the labia majora and wall of the vagina below. The vestibule is a triangular interval, with the apex at the clitoris and the base at the orifice of the vagina, the sides being formed by the nymphce. An inch below the clitoris is the meatus urinarius, which is slightly prominent, and is placed immediately above the orifice of the vagina. The entrance of the vagina may be more or less occluded by a hymen, which is a reduplication of mucous membrane, usually of a crescentic form with the concave border upwards. The carunculce myrtiformes are three or four little projections from the vaginal wall behind the hymen, and are independent of that membrane. On each side of the vagina immediately in front of the hymen, or its remains, are the orifices of the vulvo-vayinal glands or glands of Bartholin. The orifices of numerous sebaceous follicles will also be found scattered over the vulva. The true perinoeum of the female is between the posterior commis-THE PERINEUM. 169 sure of the labia and the anal orifice, and is from an inch to an inch- and-a-half long, hut becomes considerably elongated during labour. The finger should be introduced into the vagina to ascertain the position and condition of the cervix and os uteri. Boundaries of the Perinseum.—These are the same in both sexes, and can be best ascertained by placing a pelvis, on which the ligaments are preserved, in the same position as the subject, when the space under examination will be seen to correspond with the in- ferior aperture of the pelvis. In front is the symphysis pubis, with the divergent rami extending to the tuberosities of the ischia, which form the lateral boundaries. Posteriorly the great sacro-sciatic liga- ments extend to the sacrum, but in the recent subject the margins of the glutei maximi muscles overlap these and reach to the coccyx, which is the posterior limit of the space. The perinseum has been generally considered to resemble the heraldic lozenge, but has more aptly been compared to an inverted ace-of-hearts (Thompson). The inferior aperture of the pelvis is larger in the female than in the male, but considerable variation in the space between the rami of the pubes will be found in different individuals. The perinseal space may be conveniently divided into halves, by a line passing from the anterior border of one tuberosity of the ischium to the other ; the anterior or urethral half contains the urino-genital organs, and the posterior or rectal half the lower extremity of the bowel. Posterior Space in both Sexes. [A little cotton-wool is to be introduced into the rectum, and the anus is then to be carefully sewn up, the stitches being placed as near the white line mentioned above as possible. A transverse incision is then to be made in front of the anus, connecting the two tuberosities, and a similar one across the lower extremity of the coccyx. These are to be joined by incisions carried round the anus as near the sutures as possible, and the skin is to be reflected on each side.] The Sphincter Ani (Fig. 88, 16) (external) surrounds the anus and is close beneath the skin. It consists of two symmetrical halves, which are attached to the tip of the coccyx behind, and meet in front of the anus at the ‘ central point of the perinseum.’ The external sphincter controls the lower end of the bowel, and is supplied'by the inferior hsemorrhoidal nerve and by a branch of the fourth sacral nerve. The Internal Sphincter cannot be seen at present. It is merelyTHE PERINJSUM. 170 a thickened band of the unstriped circular fibres of the rectum, and differs therefore in structure from the external sphincter, which is a voluntary muscle. [The edge of the gluteus maximus is now to he defined, since it forms the boundary of the dissection; it will be found extending obliquely upwards and outwards (in this position) from the tip of the coccyx. The fat filling the space between the anus and the edge of the muscle is to be carefully removed piecemeal, care being taken to preserve the inferior hasmorrhoidal vessels and nerve which run nearly transversely towards the bowel, and also a little branch of the fourth sacral nerve near the posterior part of the space, or ischio-rectal fossa.] The Ischio-rectal Fossa (Fig. 88) is the space on each side of the rectum, bounded behind by the gluteus maximus muscle and great sacro-sciatic ligament, in front by the pubes and triangular ligament. Its deep boundaries are, on the inner side the levator ani muscle, which slings the rectum, and has an oblique direction towards the middle line ; and on the outer side, the obturator internus lying on the internal surface of the thyroid foramen. Both these muscles are covered by processes of fascia derived from the pelvic fascia ; that covering the obturator muscle being called the obturator fascia, and that upon the levator ani being the anal fascia (see diagram of pelvic fascia). When the finger is pushed into this space, it is prevented from entering the pelvis by the reflection of this fascia upon the two muscles, and on the surface of the body the fossa corresponds to the space between the anus and the tuber ischii. The ischio-rectal fossa is filled with loose granular fat, which is traversed by the inferior lisemorrhoidal vessels and nerve. On the outer side of the space and behind the margin of the pubes, the pudic vessels and nerves, which afterwards pass forward through the an- terior part of the space, can be felt enclosed in a tube of fascia ; and it is here that the artery can be effectually compressed in cases of haemorrhage after lithotomy. Surgery.—The tissues in the ischio-rectal fossa are more or less involved in the several forms of fistula in ano, and the sphincter ani, together with some of the fat and a small branch of artery, will be more or less divided in the ordinary operation for the cure of that affection. In the operation of lateral lithotomy the left ischio-rectal fossa is cut into, and care has to be taken not to injure the rectum on the inner, or the pudic artery on the outer, side of the space. The Levator Ani Muscle (Fig. 88, 18) arises within the pelvis, being attached to the back of the os pubis, to the spine of the ischium,THE INFERIOR HEMORRHOIDAL ARTERY. 171 and to the pelvic fascia between those points. It is now seen at its insertion into the central line of the perinseum, where it meets its fellow of the opposite side both in front of and behind the rectum ; it is inserted also into the side of the rectum, and into the anterior surface of the extremity of the coccyx with the opposite muscle. The levator ani supports the pelvic viscera, and, when in contrac- tion, tends to prevent the expulsion of their contents. It may also he Fig. 88. v considered as an extraordinary muscle of expiration, since it acts upon the viscera in opposition to the diaphragm. It is supplied by the fourth sacral nerve. The Inferior Eeemorrhoidal Artery (Fig. 88, 13) arises from the pudic artery under cover of the ischium, and takes a nearly transverse Fig. 88.—Superficial dissection of male perinasum (drawn by J.

Vence comites take the same course as the artery, and join the pudic vein. The Inferior Hsemorrhoidal Nerve (Fig. 88, 13) is a branch of the internal pudic nerve, or may arise separately from the lower part of the sacral plexus. In the latter case it takes the same course as the pudic nerve and is contained in the same sheath of fascia. The nerve takes a nearly transverse course in the perinseum, lying superficially to the inferior hsemorrhoidal vessels, and is distributed to the external sphincter and skin of the anus, giving a branch forward to join the superficial perinseal nerves. The Perinceal Branch of the fourth sacral nerve is of small size and not readily seen. It appears at the side of the coccyx by piercing the coccygeus muscle, and is distributed to the external sphincter. Anterior Space in the Male. [The scrotum being drawn up with hooks, an incision is to be made in the median line, extending from the central point of the perinseum to within three inches of the extremity of the penis. The sldn is to be reflected to each side, and the testicles held out of the way with hooks.] The Superficial Fascia of the anterior half of the perinseum is divisible into two layers—superficial and deep. The superficial layer of superficial fascia is continuous with the fascia over the body, which it resembles, but is peculiar in the scrotum, since there involuntary muscular fibres are developed in it, which give it a pink appearance and constitute the dartos. The deep layer of superficial fascia (Fig. 88, 6) is brought into view by the removal of the superficial layer, but varies considerably in appearance in different subjects, being a distinct membrane in thin subjects, hut not easily defined in fat ones. It is continuous with the deep layer of fascia of the groin, and is attached on each side to the front of the rami of the pubes and ischium nearly to the tuberosity. It then makes a turn around the trans- versus perinsei muscle on each side, and joins the deep perinseal fascia or triangular ligament. A pouch is thus formed containing the bulb of the urethra with its surrounding muscles, vessels, and nerves, and this is divided into two parts by an incomplete median septum. This pouch is of importance surgically with regard to extravasation of urine. If extravasation should occur from rupture of the bulbousSUPERFICIAL PERINLEAL VESSELS AND NERVES. 173 or adjacent portion of the urethra, either from external violence or from the unskilful use of a catheter, the urine is effused into this pouch, and, being prevented by the arrangement of the fascia from running hack to the anus, and by the attachment of the fascia to the rami of the pubes and ischium from extending laterally on to the thighs, it necessarily distends the pouch and creeps up into the scrotum and groin. [The deep layer of superficial fascia is to he reiUoved, and the superficial perinseal vessels and nerves dissected out.] The Superficial Perinseal Artery (Fig. 88, 5) is a branch of the internal pudic, and arises under cover of the ramus of the ischium, to run forwards and inwards. It enters the pouch of fascia by piercing the lower border of the triangular ligament, and then passes over or under the transversus perinsei muscle, to run forwards and supply the superficial muscles of the perinseum and the integuments of the scrotum. The Transverse Perinseal Artery (Fig. 91, 11) is a branch of the internal pudic arising immediately in front of, or with, the pre- ceding vessel. It runs towards the median line close to the trans- versus muscle, and anastomoses with the opposite artery and with the neighbouring branches. Veins corresponding to the arteries open into the internal pudic vein. The Superficial Perinseal Nerves (Fig. 88) are two in number, and are branches of the internal pudic nerve. The external or posterior (3) nerve has a short course in the ischio- rectal fossa, where it gives a branch to the anus. It then pierces the reflection of the deep layer of superficial fascia, and gives branches to the scrotum, forming a junction with the inferior pudendal nerve of Soemmering. The internal or anterior (7) nerve accompanies the superficial perinatal artery, either over or under the transversus perinsei muscle, and is distributed to the scrotum near the median line, where it unites with its fellow of the opposite side, giving also one or two small branches to the levator ani. The Inferior Pudendal Nerve (Fig. 88, 1) (Soemmering) is a branch of the small sciatic nerve, which pierces the deep fascia of the thigh about an inch in front of the tuberosity of the ischium. It varies a good deal in size and distribution, hut generally runs inwards and forwards to the scrotum to join the external superficial perinseal nerve. [The superficial vessels and nerves are to he turned aside and theTHE MALE PERINEUM. 174 muscles dissected out. The accelerator urinae is in the median line, the erector penis parallel to the ramus of the pubes, and the trans- versus perinaei crosses between tliem posteriorly ; the muscles thus bounding a triangular space in which a part of the triangular liga- ment is seen.] Superficial Muscles of tlie Perinaeum. The Accelerator Urinse (Fig. 88, 8) (ejaculator seminis or bulbo- cavernosus) is a single muscle, composed of two symmetrical halves united in the middle line by a delicate fibrous raphe. The fibres arise from the central point of the perinaeum and from the fibrous raphe in the middle line, and are thus inserted:—the posterior fibres, which are nearly transverse in their direction, overlie the bulb and are lost upon the triangular ligament; the middle fibres enclose the urethra and corpus spongiosum ; and the anterior fibres enclose the entire penis, including the dorsal vessels. The Erector Penis (Fig. 88, io) covers the crus penis on the ramus of the os pubis. It arises from the anterior and inner surface of the tuberosity of the ischium, and also from the ramus of the ischium, and ends in an aponeurosis which is inserted into the sides of the crus penis. The Transversus Perinaei (Fig. 88, 14) varies in size, and may be divided into two slips. It arises from the inner side of the ramus of the ischium, and meets its fellow muscle of the opposite side in the central point of the perinaeum, where it is also blended with the fibres of the accelerator urinae and sphincter ani. The action of the accelerator is to expel the contents of the urethra by its sudden and spasmodic contraction. It is not put in action during the greater part of the act of micturition ; but when the flow of urine has ceased, it serves to eject the small remaining portion, or may be used to arrest the flow of urine suddenly, when its action gives rise to considerable pain. Its action during coition is expressed by the name ejaculator seminis, and its anterior fibres assist materi- ally in producing erection of the penis by compressing the dorsal vein. The erector penis assists somewhat in the production of erection, by compressing the corpus cavernosum. Muscular Nerves (Fig. 88, 9). Passing either over or through the transversus perinaei muscle will be found branches of the pudic nerve, which arise from it either separately or in common with the anterior superficial perinaeal nerve. These branches are distributed to the muscles of the perinaeum, and a good-sized branch may be followed through the fibres of the accelerator urinae to the bulb of the urethra (bulbo-urethral nerve of Cruveilhier).THE TRIANGULAR LIGAMENT. 175 Surgery.—The triangular space enclosed by the three superficial muscles, and of which the floor is formed by the triangular ligamebt or deep perinaeal fascia, is important surgically as being the point to which the knife reaches in the incision for lateral lithotomy. In the first incision the surgeon cuts freely through the superficial structures, dividing the superficial perinaeal and inferior hsemorrlioidal vessels and nerves, and aiming at the lower part of this space, at which point the finger will feel somewhat indistinctly the staff in the urethra. The deeper incision necessarily divides the transverse muscle and artery, together with the lower part of the triangular ligament, and enables the operator to reach the staff in the mem- branous portion of the urethra. It should be noticed how the small space between the anus and the bulb of the urethra can be increased by drawing the whole penis upwards ; this fact is of importance in relation to median lithotomy, which is performed in this space, and in which operation there is some risk of wounding the bulb. It is obvious that any cutting operation in the median line of the perinseuni would be accompanied by but little haemorrhage, until the vascular structure of the bulb or corpus spongiosum urethrae was reached. [The accelerator urinae is to be divided in the middle line, and dissected from the bulb beneath and from the triangular ligament, but its anterior fibres must not be interfered with. The transversus perinaei is to be removed, and the erector penis detached from the bone with the crus penis, which will be seen to be a vascular body attached to the ramus of the pubes for nearly an inch. This is to be drawn forward, a branch of artery going to it being carefully pre- served ; the triangular ligament will then be exposed.] The posterior part of the Corpus Spongiosum Urethrae (Tig. 89, 6) will be seen to be a dark, vascular body, which expands to form the bulb, immediately in front of the triangular ligament. The Bulb is slightly expanded from side to side, and consists of two halves united by a delicate septum of fibrous tissue. It is closely connected with the triangular ligament, with which its delicate fibrous covering is continuous. The Anterior Triangular Ligament of the urethra or Deep Perinaeal Pascia (Fig. 89, 8) is a strong process of fibrous tissue stretching across the pubic arch, being attached to the rami of the pubes and ischium on each side beliind the crura penis. The apex of the ligament is connected with the sub-pubic liga- ment, and the base has been seen to be continuous with the deep layer of superficial fascia which turns around the transversus perinaei ;176 THE MALE PERINEUM. but it is also connected with, the central point of the perinaeum, and is continuous with the anal fascia over the levator ani muscle (p. 170). About an inch below the pubes the urethra perforates the trian- gular ligament, with which it is inseparably united, and above this Kg. 89. point are the openings for the dorsal vessels and nerves of the penis,, the vein being in the median line with the artery and nerve on each side, the last most external. [It is advisable not to proceed any further with the dissection of the left side of the perinaeum, in order that a good side view of this region may be obtained in a subsequent dissection. On the right side the anterior triangular ligament is to be carefully detached from the bone and from its attachments below, and turned towards the Eig. 89.—Deep dissection of the male perinaeum, the anterior triangular ligament being removed on the right side (drawn by J.

Posterior to these is a process of the pelvic fascia, forming the posterior layer of the triangular ligament, and continuous with the capsule of the prostate. Deep Muscles.—Muscular fibres having a transverse direction hut varying considerably in size and distinctness, will be seen on the removal of the anterior triangular ligament. These form the com- pressor urethras, but the lower part, when very distinct, may be called the deep transverse muscle. The Compressor vel Con- strictor Urethrae (Fig. 90, 7) (Guthrie’s muscle) arises from the posterior aspect of the ramus of the pubes, and divides into two slips, which run inwards trans- versely to enclose the membranous portion of the urethra, meeting the opposite muscle in a median raphe, and being expanded upon the whole length of tliis portion of the canal. Circular muscular fibres surround the membranous urethra beneath the compressor, but these are in- voluntaiy, and continuous with the muscular fibres of the prostate (Ellis). Behind the lower portion of this muscle near the middle line is situate one of Cowper’s glands, and the muscle may conceal the artery to the bulb if it should arise lower than usual. Fig. 90.

K178 THE MALE PERINEUM. The Deep Transverse Muscle is generally merely the lower portion of the preceding muscle, which meets its fellow of the opposite side in the median line below the urethra. [The muscular fibres are to he divided near the urethra in order to see one of Cowper’s glands, and the pudic artery and nerve with their branches are to he followed out.] Cowper’s Glands (Fig. 89, io) are close to the membranous portion of the urethra, one being on each side of the median line, and are most readily found by tracing to each gland a small branch from the artery to the bulb. Each gland resembles a dried pea in size and shape, but consists of numerous minute lobules. Although the gland is so close to the membranous urethra, the duct opens into the bulbous portion of the canal, being nearly an inch long and perforating the floor of the urethra very obliquely. The membranous portion of the urethra will be more satisfactorily examined afterwards than in the present dissection, but opportunity should be taken to feel the staff in the urethra at this point, since it is where that tube would be opened, on the left side, in the operation of lateral lithotomy, or in the middle line in the median operation. The Pudic Artery (Fig. 91, 9) will be found under cover of the pubic arch. It ascends behind the triangular ligament, and, after giving off the artery to the bulb and the artery to the corpus caver- nosum, ends in the dorsal artery of the penis. The Artery to the Bulb (Fig. 89, 7) is a good-sized branch, which is generally above the level of the compressor urethrae muscle. It passes transversely inwards to supply the bulb, to reach which it has to pierce the triangular ligament close to the middle line. It gene- rally gives a branch to the Cowper’s gland of the same side. The size and position of the artery to the bulb vary considerably, and are of importance with reference to lateral lithotomy. When the origin is as high as represented in Fig. 89 the artery must be free from danger, but if it should arise lower (and it is occasionally found in the ischio-rectal fossa), it wrould be liable to be cut, when from its size it might give rise to troublesome and even fatal haemorrhage. The Artery to the Corpus Cavernosum (Fig. 91, 14) is a small branch which enters that vascular body and ramifies in its interior. The Dorsal Artery of the Penis is the termination of the internal pudic. It ascends between the bone and the crus penis, andTHE PUDIC NERVE. 179 then pierces the suspensory ligament to reach the upper surface of the organ, where it will he subsequently traced. When the pudic artery is small, the dorsal arteries are derived from the trunks of the internal iliacs, and reach the penis by piercing the triangular ligament on each side of the dorsal vein. Fig. 91. The Dorsal Vein of the penis will afterwards be seen piercing the pelvic fascia to join the prostatic plexus of veins. The Veins corresponding to the other branches of the pudic artery take the same course as their arteries, and open into the pudic vein.

[The flaps of skin should be carefully sewed together before the body is moved from its position.] Anterior Space in the Female. [A little cotton-wool is to be inserted in the vagina, and the margins of the labia majora are to be fastened together by a few stitches. An incision is then to be carried transversely above the junction of the labia, from which two vertical incisions, as near the margin of each labium as convenient, are to be prolonged to the central point of the perinseum. The flaps of skin can now be re- flected from the middle line, supposing the transverse incision behind the labia to have been already made.] The Superficial Fascia of the anterior half of the female perinseum resembles that of the male, in being divisible into two layers—super- ficial and deep. The superficial layer of superficial fascia is continuous with the fascia of the body generally, and usually contains much fat, forming the labium. The deep layer of superficial fascia is not so strongly marked as in the male, but has the same connections. It is continuous with the deep fascia of the groin, and is attached on each side to the front of the rami of the pubes and ischium, nearly to the tuberosity. It then makes a turn around the transversus perimei muscle on each side, and joins the deep perimeal fascia or triangular ligament, v. p. 183. Owing to the position of the vulva, the deep layer of superficial fascia is divided in the middle line and becomes continuous with the sheath of the vagina ; and thus also the pouch between the deep layer of superficial fascia and the triangular ligament (p. 172) is divided in the female into two parts, which have been named pudendal or vulvo-scrotal sacs of Broca. [The deep layer of superficial fascia is to be removed, and the superficial perimeal vessels and nerves dissected out.] The Superficial Perinseal Artery (artery of the labium) (Fig. 92, 5) is larger than in the male. It is a branch of the internal pudic artery, and arises under cover of the ramus of the ischium to run forwards and inwards. It enters the pouch of fascia by piercing the lower border of the triangular ligament, and then passes over orTHE TRANSVERSE ARTERY. 181 under the transversus perinsei muscle to supply the superficial muscles of the perinceum and the labium.

The internal or anterior (13) nerve runs upwards and inwards, entering the pouch of fascia and being distributed to the posterior part of the vulva. The external or posterior (14) nerve is larger, and is distributed over the superficial muscles of the perinseum, forming a junction with the inferior pudendal nerve of Soemmering. The Inferior Pudendal Nerve (Soemmering) (Fig. 92, 16) is a branch of the small sciatic nerve, which pierces the deep fascia of the thigh about an inch in front of the tuberosity of the ischium. It is usually of small size in the female, and runs upwards and inwards to join the external superficial perinseal nerve. [The superficial vessels and nerves are to be turned aside and the muscles dissected out. The muscles are much less distinct than in the male perinseum, and it is impossible to trace all their fibres without maceration and preparation, which it is impracticable for the student to undertake ; he will be able to make out sufficient however to assist materially in following the description.] The Perinseal Body of Savage (Fig. 93, 14) is a structure peculiar to women, consisting of a mass of elastic tissue placed between the orifices of the vagina and rectum, and uniting all the tissues which meet in the central point of the perinseum. Its use appears to be to allow of great stretching, without tearing, during parturition. The Superficial Muscles (Figs. 92 and 93) of the female peri- nseum closely resemble those of the male, with the exception that the two portions of the central muscle (corresponding to the accele- rator urinse) are separated by the vulva. On each side therefore of the vulva will be found the bulbo-cavernosus ; lying on the ramus of the pubes, the erector clitoridis ; and, passing from the tuber ischii to the central point of the perinseum, the transversus perinsei. The Bulbo-Cavernosus (sphincter vaginae) (Fig. 93, 5) arises from the elastic perinceal body between the anus and vagina, two or three of its superficial fibres being prolonged into the sphincter ani ; also from the reflection of the deep layer of superficial fascia (ischio- perinaeal ligament of Savage) for nearly an inch, and decussating with the inner fibres of the transversus. The fibres of the muscle are divisible into three sets, corresponding to those of the accelerator urinae of the male. The anterior fibres pass forward on each side of the vulva to meet those of the opposite muscle upon the clitoris, and to be partially inserted into the sheath of the clitoris ; the middle fibres pass beneath the clitoris and over the great veins upon the183 SUPERFICIAL PERINyEAL MUSCLES. urethra, which are analogous to the corpus spongiosum of the male, meeting those of the opposite side; the posterior fibres pass on to the triangular ligament (Savage). The Erector Clitoridis (Fig. 93, 3) resembles the erector penis in the male, and though actually smaller in size, bears a much larger \ Fig. 93. * proportion to its organ than that muscle. It arises from the front ot the tuber ischii, and is inserted on the sides of the crus clitoridis.

The Levator Ani (Fig. 93, 11) is divided by Savage into three parts : 1. The pubo-coccyyeus is now seen in part, its fibres having the same direction as the sphincter ani. It arises from the back of the pubes, and its fibres encircle the rectum between the superficial and deep sphincters, and are inserted into the side of the last two bones of the coccyx. 2. The obturato-coccyrjeus arises from the ilio- pubic line of division of the pelvic fascia into obturator and recto- vesical layers (white-line), and is inserted into the side of the last two bones of the coccyx. 3. The ischio-coccygeus corresponds to the coccygeus muscle as ordinarily described, and extends from the spine of the ischium to the side of the coccyx. [The bulbo-cavernosus muscle is to be divided at its origin and turned up, being dissected from the bulb of the vagina beneath and from the triangular ligament. The transversus perinsei is to be removed, and the erector clitoridis detached from the bone with the crus clitoridis, which will be seen to be a vascular body attached to the ramus of the pubes for half an inch. This is to be drawn forward, a branch of artery going to it being preserved, and the triangular ligament will be exposed.] The Bulb of the Vagina (Fig. 93, 8) (bulbus vestibuli of Kobelt) corresponds precisely to one half of the bulb of the male. It is a vascular body placed on the side of the orifice of the vagina, and enclosed in a sheath of fascia derived from the triangular ligament or deep perinaeal fascia. Each bulb is about an inch long, and is composed of a plexus of veins, which communicate with the great veins of the clitoris. The Triangular Ligament (Fig. 93) or Deep Perinaeal fascia resembles that of the male, and is a strong process of fibrous tissue stretching across the pubic arch, being attached to the rami of the pubes and ischium on each side behind the crura clitoridis. It i3 perforated by the urethra and by the vagina, with the coats of which it is firmly incorporated; it gives passage also to the terminal branches of the pudic arteries and nerves, as in the male, and to the large veins of the clitoris and bulbs which pass to the plexus on the neck of the bladder. [The triangular ligament is to be carefully detached from the bone and removed, when the deep muscles and the terminal branches of the pudic artery and nerve are to be dissected.]THE ABDOMINAL WALL. 185 The Deep Muscles are the Deep Transverse, and the Constrictor of the Vagina. The Deep Transverse Muscle arises from the ramus of the ischium and passes to the central point of the perinseum, where it meets its fellow of the opposite side. The Constrictor of the Vagina consists of a few fibres which arise from the central point of the perinseum, and ascend to meet the muscle of the opposite side over the urethra. Involuntary circular fibres surround the whole length of the female urethra. The Glands of Bartholin (Fig. 93, 12) correspond to Cowper’s glands in the male. Each gland is of the size of a small bean, and is situated behind the triangular ligament opposite the lower border of the bulb. The minute duct of each gland opens on the mucous surface of the vagina, about half an inch from the orifice and in front of the hymen. Pudic Artery and Nerve (Fig. 92). The terminations of the pudic artery and nerve in the female correspond closely to those of the male, but are much smaller. The artery lies under cover of the ramus of the pubes with the nerve, and gives off an artery to the bulb, to the crus clitoridis, and the dorsal artery of the clitoris. The artery of the bulb (8) runs transversely inwards, and terminates in the bulb of the vagina. The artery to the crus clitoridis (9) is very small, and is lost in that organ. The dorsal artery of the clitoris (7) reaches the dorsum of the organ with the corresponding nerve. The Dorsal Vein of the clitoris is of large size, and passes backwards to open into the great veins around the neck of the bladder. The Pudic Nerve (n) gives off muscular branches (12), and ends in the dorsal nerve of the clitoris (18), which bears a much larger proportion to that organ than the corresponding nerve of the penis. [The flaps of skin should be carefully fastened together with stitches before the body is moved from its position.] Dissection of the Abdominal Wall. The dissection of the Perinseum having been completed, the student should proceed to examine the abdominal wall, the condition of which will vary considerably in different subjects. In a fat subject the wall of the abdomen will be smooth and uniform, but in a thinTHE ABDOMINAL WALL. 18G muscular subject the prominences of the muscles will be readily recognised. In all bodies, the umbilicus will be seen in the median line about midway between the pubes and the ensiform cartilage of the sternum, and it should be noted whether there is any protrusion at this point, constituting an exomphalos or umbilical hernia. The median line will be found to be slightly depressed, corresponding, as mil be afterwards seen, to the linea alba, and it is here, below the umbilicus, that the operation of paracentesis or tapping the abdomen is performed. On each side of the median line and parallel to it, is the promi- nence caused by the rectus abdominis muscle, and occasionally the markings in that muscle known as the linea; transversce can be seen through the skin. Immediately above the pubes and close to the median line is occasionally seen the prominence of the pyramidalis muscle on each side. The pubic bone will be recognised with the finger, which should be carried outwards to the spine of the pubes, to which Poupart’s ligament is attached. The ligament when traced out will be followed along the fold of the groin to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, from which the iliac crest passes backwards. On the sides of the lower part of the thorax, the interdigitations of the obliquus extemus with the serratus magnus may be seen through the skin, in a well developed subject. The condition of the abdominal rings and inguinal canal should be carefully examined before the skin is removed. If the spermatic cord be traced up from the testis, it may be felt to disappear through an opening known as the external abdominal ring, and even in a per- fectly well-formed subject the fore-finger can be passed into the ring with tolerable facility, if pushed up from below, carrying the scrotum before it. In a subject with a tendency to hernia, the finger can be carried along the inguinal canal to the internal abdominal ring, or if a rupture actually exists, may be passed into the abdominal cavity, pushing before it the loose skin. If any tumour of the scrotum should happen to be present, it should be carefully examined and its nature diagnosed, with a view to confirmation by subsequent examination. In the female, the abdominal ring is usually of small size, and generally too contracted to admit the finger, but may be enlarged by a hernia. The projection above the pubes which is covered with hair and known as the mons Veneris, is due simply to a development of fat in the superficial fascia at this point. The skin of the abdomen of women who have borne children is marked by numerous small white scars, the result of its over-distension during pregnancy.CUTANEOUS NERVES OF ABDOMEN. 187 Percussion and palpation should be carefully practised, in order to make out the limits of the principal organs of the abdomen before the dissection is begun, and the student is referred to Fig. 106, on which the position of the several viscera is shown iii health, but from which considerable variations may be expected. The presence of fluid in the peritoneal cavity may be ascertained by the production of fluctuation, between the hands applied on opposite sides of the abdomen. [In order to dissect the abdominal wall, it is necessary to distend the abdomen fully with air. To do this, a narrow knife should be thrust through the umbilicus into the peritoneal cavity, and a blowpipe be inserted. A circular incision is then to be made through the skin round the umbilicus, and a piece of whipcord tied round the blow- pipe and in the groove cut in the skin. When the abdomen has been fully distended, the blowpipe is to be withdrawn, and the opening carefully secured. One incision is to be carried from the ensiform cartilage to the pubes (avoiding the umbilicus), and another at right angles to it along the crest of the ilium and from the anterior superior spine of the ilium horizontally to the middle line. A third at the level of the ensiform cartilage is to reach well back to the loins. The skin is then to be reflected from the median line by these incisions.] The Superficial Fascia in this region resembles that throughout the body, but is sometimes much loaded with fat ; it is to be re- flected by the same incisions as the skin, and in doing this there will be found in it the terminations of the cutaneous nerves. The Cutaneoirs Nerves (Fig. 94) consist of two sets, anterior and lateral. The anterior nerves, which are very small, will be found in two rows, one close to the linea alba, and the other piercing the tendon of the external oblique two inches from the median line ; the lateral branches will be found of greater length, running along the fibres of the same muscle and also giving a few small twigs back- wards. Both sets are derived from the dorsal spinal nerves. About two inches behind the anterior spine of the ilium and half an inch above tire crest, will be found the lateral cutaneous branch of the last dorsal nerve, and close upon the crest of the bone a little pos- terior to the preceding nerve will be seen the iliac branch of the ilio-hypogastric nerve (1st lumbar), both of them going to the buttock (13). Accompanying the nerves will be found (in a well-injected body only) small branches of arteries derived from the intercostal, internal mammary, and epigastric arteries.188 THE ABDOMINAL WALL. [The external oblique muscle is to be cleaned, the dissector begin- ning from below on the right side, and from above on the left, and taking care not to remove its tendon near the median line by mistake.

Its fibres pass obliquely downwards and forwards towards the middle line, except the posterior ones, which pass vertically to the crest of the ilium. [In order to see the whole of the insertion of this muscle it will be necessary to continue the dissection by reflecting the triangle of skin left upon the groin.] The Superficial Fascia of the Groin (Fig. 95) differs from that over the abdomen in being divisible into two layers—superficial and deep. The superficial layer of superficial fascia (a) resembles that found elsewhere, but the deep layer (b) (Scarpa’s fascia) is more mem- branous. It is directly continuous with the deep layer of the super- ficial fascia in the perinteum (p. 172), and is attached firmly to the fascia lata of the thigh a little below Poupart’s ligament, thus pre- venting any urine which may have been infiltrated into the tissues from passing down the thigh. Superficial Vessels and Nerves (Fig. 95).—Between the layers of superficial fascia, will be found three small branches of the femoral artery with their accompanying veins. The superficial circumflex iliac (d) runs outwards about the level of Poupart’s ligament to the anterior superior spine ; the superficial epigastric (e) rims upwards for a short distance on the abdominal wall; and the superior external pudic (/) runs over the spermatic cord to the scrotum. The veins corresponding to these arteries join the saphenous vein as it opens into the femoral. Upon, or a little below, Poupart’s ligament will be found two or three glands, which receive the lymphatics from the penis and scrotum. The tendon of the obliquus externus being exposed, a nerve will be found piercing it about two inches above the pubes—the ilio- hypogastric from the 1st lumbar; and another may be traced upon the spermatic cord—the ilio-inguinal (n) also from the 1st lumbar (Fig. 94). 13.

In addition to these larger insertions there are two small ones which cannot he defined in the present stage, viz., into the ilio-pectineal line (forming Gimbernat’s ligament) and into the crest of the pubes of the opposite side, forming the triangular fascia. Immediately above the pubes, the spermatic cord (or the round ligament of the uterus in the female) will be seen to emerge from the tendon, the opening being obscured by the inter columnar or external spermatic fascia, which must be removed to expose the abdominal ring. The External Abdominal Ring' (Fig. 95, i) is merely a slit in the external oblique tendon, placed obliquely immediately above and to the outer side of the spine of the pubes. In the healthy subject it is triangular with the base downwards and inwards, being about an inch in length and half an inch across, and its boundaries have been named the pillars or columns of the ring. It will be observed that the outer pillar is triangular at the upper part, but becomes round and thick below, and corresponds to Poupart’s ligament ; whilst the internal pillar is flat, and is continuous with the rest of the tendon. At the upper part of the ring may be seen some curved fibres running in a transverse direction and called the intercolumnar fibres, the con- tinuation of which formed the intercolumnar or external spermatic fascia. It should be noticed that the spermatic cord does not lie in the centre of the ring, but upon the outer pillar or Poupart’s ligament, which is slightly drawn down by the weight of the testis. [The external oblique is to be reflected by cutting, both vertically and horizontally, through its muscular fibres where they join the tendon, and by detaching them from the ribs immediately below their origin. The greater part of the muscle can then be turned back towards the loin, and the corresponding tendon may be dis- sected up as far as possible towards the median line. The handle of the knife should be passed under the triangular portion of tendon left in the groin, parallel to and as near the median line as possible, after which the tendon may be readily divided by a vertical incision, and reflected towards the thigh without endangering the subjacent parts. When this is done, it will be found that the tendinous fibres of one side decussate or interlace with those of the other immediately above the pubes, and cross to the opposite side of the median line, where they become attached to the spine and crest of the pubes, and sometimes as far as the ilio-pectineal line, thus forming the triangular fascia.* The internal oblique muscle will * This tissue, which can be defined in well-developed subjects only, is better named triangular fascia than triangular ligament, which is apt to be confounded with the deep fascia of the perinseum.192 THE ABDOMINAL WALL. Fig. 96. then be exposed, and will be most readily cleaned by beginning at the lower border of the muscle on the right side, and at the upper border on the left side of the subject.] The Obliquus Internus (Fig. 94, 7).—The fibres of this muscle take the opposite direction to those of the obliquus externus, and therefore have their origin below and their insertion chiefly above. The origin is from the anterior two-thirds of the middle of the crest of the ilium ; from the outer half of Poupart’s liga- ment ; and slightly from the fascia lumborum. The upper fibres pass to be inserted into the cartilages of the last four ribs, and into the linea alba by an aponeurosis, which is split to enclose the rectus and form its sheath, as will be afterwards seen; while the lower fibres, becoming gradually more and more horizontal in their course to the middle line, in the end arch downwards to help to form the conjoined tendon, and to be inserted into the crest of the pubes and the ilio-pectineal line. In the male subject, some pale muscular fibres will be found to be continuous with the lower border of the internal oblique, and to overlie the spermatic cord, forming the cremaster muscle. The Cremaster (Fig. 100, h), consists of a series of thin muscular loops spread over the spermatic cord. It is attached externally to the inner end of Poupart's ligament, where it is continuous with the internal oblique, and internally to the spine and crest of the pubes. In addition to the loops, there are a few muscular fibres on each side of the spermatic cord connected with the cremasteric fascia. The cremaster is supplied by the genital branch of the genito-crural nerve. Figs. 96, 97, 98.—Diagrams to illustrate the descent of the testis and the forma- tion of the tunica vaginalis (drawn by J. T. Gray).THE CREMASTER. 193 To explain the formation of this muscle it will he necessary to refer to the early stage of foetal life, when the testis whs situated within the abdomen and immediately below the kidney. About the seventh month of foetal life the testis passes through the internal abdominal ring, and by the eighth month reaches the scrotum, a process of peritoneum (processus vaginalis) preceding it, and being connected with the testis by the 'plica gubernatrix. The looped fibres of the cremaster would appear to be fibres of the internal oblique drawn down by the testicle in its descent. According to Culling, a muscular band, consisting of three sets of fibres and called the gubernaculum testis, passed from the pubes to the testis, and its divisions had the following attachments—one to the bottom of the scrotum, and one, on each side of the external abdominal ring, to Poupart’s ligament and the crest of the pubes (Fig. 96). By the action of these bands the testicle.was drawn down as far as the external abdominal ring, but it is obvious that Fig. 97. Fig. 98. when it had reached this point the lateral bands must have become horizontal, and thus have lost all power of traction ; and the further progress of the testis depended therefore upon the middle band, which continued to draw the gland to the bottom of the scrotum (Fig. 97). The effect of this was to stretch the lateral bands attached to the pubes on each side, and thus they formed more or less complete loops upon the cord, and constituted the cremaster muscle, being aided by the lower fibres of the internal oblique which were drawn down by the testicle in its progress (Fig. 98). o194 THE ABDOMINAL WALL. [Tlie internal oblique is to be divided by a vertical incision from the last rib to the middle of the crest of tlie ilium, and this is to be carried along tlie crest and Poupart’s ligament to near the lower border of the muscle. Tlie muscular fibres must be carefully divided until a cellular interval is reached, in which, near the crista ilii, will be found the branches of an artery (circumflexa ilii). The muscle is then to be turned Fig. 99. backwards and forwards, care being taken not to injure the exposed nerves or the subjacent transversalis muscle.] The Nerves (Fig. 94), five or six in number, are the branches of the lower dorsal nerves, which run horizontally forwards to pierce the rectus muscle and emerge on the front of the abdo- men. At this stage they may be seen giving off their lateral cutaneous branches, which pierce the obliquus interims at once. Close above the crista ilii may be found the branches of the first lumbar nerve (16) (ilio-hypo- gastric and ilio-inguinal) running downwards to the pubes. The Transversalis Muscle (Fig. 99, 6) has its origin—1, from the inner surfaces of the cartilages of the lower six ribs, where it interdigitates with the diaphragm ; 2, by three aponeu- rotic slips attached respectively, to the anterior surfaces of the trans- Fig. 99.—Lateral view of the transversalis abdominis muscle (from Wilson). 1.

Its insertion is into the middle line from the ensiform cartilage to the pubes, being insep- arably united with the internal oblique ; and into the ilio-pectineal line, forming with the internal oblique the conjoined tendon. Anatomy of Inguinal Hernia. This will be the best time for examining the parts concerned in inguinal hernia, which is the protrusion of some part of the abdominal contents through certain openings in the region of the groin. To do this, the muscles should be restored as nearly as possible to their natural positions, and the student will then see again the opening in the tendon of the external oblique called the external abdominal ring. Through this opening (the intercolumnar fascia having been previously removed) the spermatic cord with its vessels will be seen to pass, and on tracing it up by turning the muscles aside in their order, it will be found to disappear beneath the sharp arched border of the transversalis muscle. The tissue ii to which it disappears is the fascia transversalis, lining the abdomen externally to the peritoneum, and with a little care a hole may be artificially made in this fascia and around the cord, to which the name of internal abdominal rincj is given. The opening of the in- ternal ring is necessarily artificial, because the fascia transversalis was prolonged upon the cord when the testis was drawn out of the abdomen, and thus took the shape of a funnel, being hence called the infundibular fascia.* (Fig. 100, i.) The Internal Abdominal Ring (Fig. 101) is an opening in the fascia transversalis, placed midway between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine, and about half an inch above Poupart’s ligament, immediately external to the deep epigastric vessels. The Inguinal Canal (Fig. 100) is the space between the external and internal abdominal rings, an inch and a half in length, and is occupied by the spermatic, cord. The simplest way therefore to study the boundaries of the canal will be to take them in their relation to the cord which lies in it (Fig. 101). In front of the inguinal canal are 1, (in its whole length) the -* The infundibular fascia has also been called the internal spermatic fascia. o 2INGUINAL HERNIA. 196 tendoiTof the external oblique ; 2, (in its outer third) the lowest part of the*muscular fibres of the internal oblique ; and 3, a small portion of the cremaster.

Oblique passes through the internal abdominal ring, along the inguinal canal, and out of the external ring. Direct breaks through or pushes before it the posterior wall of the inguinal canal at its lower part in Hessel- bach’s triangle, i.e., the space bounded by the epigastric artery, the rectus, and Poupart’s ligament, and emerges at the external ring, thus taking a more direct course than the oblique variety. The coverings of each hernia will be best seen by tracing them from within outwards ; thus oblique hernia would have (1) peri- toneal sac ; (2) in coming through the internal ring it would have the fascia transversalis, or infundibular fascia ; (3) in passing beneath the internal oblique it would have the cremaster muscle, the fibres of which are united by cellular tissue and are sometimes known as the cremasteric fascia ; in emerging from the external ring it would have (4) the intercolumnar or spermatic fascia, and (5) the superficial fascia and skin. Direct hernia would have, (1) the peritoneum, and (2) the fascia transversalis, (for both line the abdomen) ; then pushing into the inguinal canal it would have a covering (3) from the conjoined tendon ; and lastly emerging from the external ring, it would have (4) the intercolumnar or spermatic fascia, and (5) the superficial Pig. 101. Fascia transversali Conjoined tendon. Triangular fascia. Fig. 101.—Diagram of the inguinal canal, showing its anterior and posterior boundaries (drawn by J. T.

Direct. Peritoneum or sac. Fascia transversalis. Conjoined tendon. Intercolunmar or spermatic fascia. Superficial fascia. Skin. By dividing the fascia transversalis about half an inch to the inner side of the internal abdominal ring, there will be found an artery called the deep epigastric, lying between the two rings and running in a line from the middle of Poupart’s ligament to the umbilicus, and the varieties of inguinal hernia have been named external or internal according to their relation to this vessel. It is obvious that a hernia passing through the internal ring must be external to this artery, and hence oblique hernia and external hernia are synonymous terms. In the same way, direct hernia protrudesdlirough the abdominal wall to the inner side of the epigastric artery, and thus internal is the same as direct hernia. The anatomy of the parts concerned in hernia being fully compre- hended, it will be readily seen that the direction in which force is to be applied to return the protruded bowel into the abdomen—com- monly called the taxis—must differ in the two cases ; and the student should notice the effect which the position of the body and limbs has upon the tissues near the groin. Thus, with the body and legs extended at full length, the lower part of the abdomen is rendered tense ; wdiilst if the thigh is flexed upon the pelvis and adducted, and the body bowed forward, the structures become relaxed, and would more readily admit of the return of the protruded bowel. Varieties of Hernia.—There are two varieties of oblique inguinal hernia, termed congenital hernia and infantile or encysted hernia, the anatomy of vfliich requires explanation. To understand these fully it will be necessary to refer for a moment to the descent of the testis (p. 193). "When the testicle is in the abdomen it has the peritoneum attached to its surface, and during its descent into the scrotum it accordingly drags a fold of peritoneum down with it, so that at first a tube extends along the whole length of the inguinal canal (Fig. 98). By a natural process199 VARIETIES OF INGUINAL HERNIA. occurring during tlie later months of foetal life, an obliteration of the portion of tube within the canal takes place, and thus a small sac is formed around the testis which is called the tunica vaginalis, while a mere dimple is left in the peritoneum at the internal ring. Tlius, when in the ordinary condition of the parts a hernia descends, its sac is above and quite distinct from the tunica vaginalis (Fig. 102). Occasionally, however, this obliteration does not take place, and the tunica vaginalis remains continuous with the peritoneum. In that case the hernia descends at once into the tunica vaginalis and lies over the testis, and being the consequence of a congenital defect it is termed congenital hernia (Fig. 103). In what is termed congenital hydrocele the anatomical arrange- ment is the same, and the fluid runs from the peritoneal cavity into the scrotum and back again, according to the position of the patient. Infantile or encysted hernia exists when only a partial obliteration of the peritoneal tube has taken place, and the tunica vaginalis is left larger than usual and prolonged into the inguinal canal to a slight extent. Thus, when a hernia descends, it pushes down behind this portion of the tunica vaginalis, and there are therefore three layers of serous membrane in front of that covering the intestine, two Fig. 102.—Diagram of a common scrotal hernia, showing the relation of the sac to the tunica vaginalis testis (J. T. Gray). Fig. 103.—Diagram of a congenital hernia, the sac being continuous with the tunica vaginalis testis (J. T. Gray).

Gray).INGUINAL HERNIA. 200 being formed by the tunica vaginalis and one by the peritoneal sac (Fig. 104). Surgery.—Operation for Strangulated Hernia.-—In this operation the object is to reach and divide any tissue which presses upon tin- bowel and prevents its return within the abdomen. An incision is made over the external ring, and the surgeon dissects carefully down through the several layers (which are never distinctly separable in practice) until he reaches the peritoneal sac, which is recognised by its bluish appearance. Passing the forefinger carefully around this he feels for the stricture, which may possibly be at the external ring (where it is easily divided), or more probably within the inguinal canal. Hating discovered the stricture, he next passes the hernia- knife along the finger, and, using it or a director as a guide, insinuates the knife, held flat, beneath the stricture, and divides it by bringing the edge of the knife upwards and pressing it against the tissues with the finger. The direction in which the superficial incision is made is of little consequence, but in the deep incision the rule is to cut directly upwards, so as to be parallel to the epigastric artery; for since a mistake in the diagnosis between an external and an internal hernia may occur, owing to the parts becoming distorted and the abdominal rings drawn together in old-standing hem ire, it is well to be careful lest the artery should be divided. Radical Cure of Hernia.—Various operations have been suggested for the cure of rupture by obliterating the inguinal canal, of which the principal are WurtzePs and Wood’s. Wurtzer’s operation con- sisted in the invagination of the skin of the scrotum, which was fastened into the inguinal canal by a plug of wood, from which a needle passed transfixing the front wall of the canal. Inflammation was thus excited, and the portion of skin remained in situ for a time, effectually plugging up the canal, but was found to descend almost nvariably after any exertion, and the operation has therefore been generally abandoned. Wood’s operation consists essentially in closing the lower part of the inguinal canal and external abdominal ring, either with or with- out the invagination of a piece of fascia. The left forefinger being passed beneath the margin of the conjoined tendon, a needle is thrust through the tendon and afterwards through the internal and external pillars of the ring, and these three points are drawn together, thus occluding the canal.* * For full particulars of the modifications of this operation, the student is referred to Mr. Wood’s valuable work on Rupture.201 TUNICA VAGINALIS TESTIS. The Spermatic Cord may now be examined, and will be found to consist of the vas deferens or duct of the testicle, together with the spermatic artery and veins, bound together with loose areolar tissue and covered more or less by the cremaster muscle. In a well-injected subject a small branch may be traced from the epigastric artery to the cord, which is the cremasteric artery ; and the genital branch of the genito-crural nerve may be found in the cremaster muscle, which it supplies. The position of the vas deferens at the back of the cord should be noticed, and may always be recognised by its feeling like a piece of whipcord. Upon the vas may be found a small branch of the vesical artery—the deferential artery. Tunica Vaginalis Testis (Fig. 102).—By drawing the testicle out of the scrotum and making an incision over the anterior part of it, the tunica vaginalis will be opened, and will be seen to consist of two parts, the tunica vaginalis propria upon the testis, and the reflexa or part around. The tunica vaginalis propria converts the subjacent tunica albuginea into a fibro-serous membrane, the other examples of which are the pericardium and the dura-mater. The Penis should now be examined, and the student may advantageously practise the operation of circumcision. It should be noticed that the skin becomes continuous with the mucous membrane at the margin of the fore-skin or prepuce, which is lined by the membrane continued from the glans penis. Below the orifice of the urethra will be found the fold called the frcenum pravputii, and around the base of the glans penis is a circular ridge, the corona glandis, upon which open a number of sebaceous glands, the glandules odoriferce, that secrete the smegma preeputii. An incision is to be carried along the upper surface of the penis, when there will be found the dorsal vein with the dorsal artery and nerve on each side of it, the nerve being most external. The artery and nerve are the terminations of the pudic artery and nerve, and the vein passes through the triangular ligament to open into the prostatic plexus. The Suspensory Ligament of the penis is a triangular piece of strong fibrous tissue, attached to the front of the symphysis pubis and to the upper surface of the penis, where it is divided into two layers to give passage to the dorsal vessels and nerves. [Returning to the abdominal wall the dissector will find the rectus muscle close to the median line and still enclosed in its sheath, through which it is indistinctly visible. The line between the recti is known as the linea alba, that at the outer border of each202 INGUINAL HERNIA. muscle as the linea semilunaris, and the transverse markings, three or four in number, are the linece transverse.] The Sheath of the Rectus (Fig. 108) having been opened by a vertical incision, will be found to be formed by the tendon of the internal oblique, which splits at the linea semilunaris to enclose it. Thus in front of the muscle there is the tendon of the obliquus extemus and one-lialf of the tendon of the obliquus internus, whilst behind is the other half of the tendon of the obliquus internus and the tendon of the transversalis. This arrangement does not hold good throughout, for upon lifting up the lower part of the rectus it will be found that a little below the umbilicus (seldom so low as midway between the umbilicus and pubes) the sheath is wanting behind, i.e. it passes entirely in front, and there is nothing between the muscle and the peritoneum but the fascia transversalis. The point where the sheath ceases to pass behind the rectus is marked by a sharp curved margin (fold of Douglas), over which the epigastric vessels will be seen to pass, and which will be after- wards seen from behind (Fig. 105, c). [In many subjects immediately above the pubes, in front of the rectus and enclosed in its sheath, will be found a little muscular slip, the pyramidalis. Both muscles are to be cleaned in the direction of their fibres.] The Pyramidalis (Fig. 94) arises from the crest of the pubes close to the median line, and passes up for about two inches to be inserted into the linea alba. The Rectus Abdominis (Fig. 94, 5) arises by two heads, one from the crest and the other from the symphysis pubis. It expands into a broad thin muscle, and is inserted into the ensiform cartilage and into the cartilages of the last three true ribs (5tli, 6th, and 7th). The linese transversse are tendinous intersections corresponding to abdominal ribs ; one is placed nearly opposite the umbilicus, a second at the level of the ensiform cartilage, and a third between them. A fourth is occasionally found between the umbilicus and the pubes. The Epigastric Artery (Fig. 100) is to be traced into the rectus muscle, which it will be found to enter at the part where the sheath is deficient, passing over the fold of Douglas. The muscle should be divided and carefully dissected off the artery, which may be traced up to the sternum, where it anastomoses with the internal mammary artery. This is a most important anastomosis, forming a direct communication between the subclavian and the external203 FASCIA TRANSVERSALIS. iliac arteries, which comes into play after ligature of the external or common iliacs, or obstruction of the descending aorta. The nerves piercing the rectus are the terminations of the lower intercostal nerves, which pass through it and the sheath to reach the skin (Fig. 94). The Fascia Transversalis is the membrane lining the trans- versalis muscle, and is continuous wutli the fascia iliaca covering the iliacus muscle. It varies in appearance, being usually thin and transparent, but in fat subjects becoming thickened and united with the sub-peritoneal layer of adipose tissue. Midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the symphysis pubis, and half an inch above Poupart’s ligament in the fascia transversalis, is the internal abdominal ring, through which the spermatic cord of the male and round ligament of the female reach the groin, receiving in their passage a covering from the fascia transversalis (infundi- bular fascia). Beneath the middle of Poupart’s ligament the fascia transversalis passes upon the external iliac vessels to join the iliac fascia in forming the sheath of the femoral vessels (p. 87), and a few thickened fibres lying beneath Poupart’s ligament form the deep crural arch. Action of the Abdominal Muscles.—The abdominal muscles compress the viscera when put in action, and thus act as muscles of expiration, and in direct opposition to the diaphragm. The attach- ment of the muscles to the lower ribs enables them at the same time to depress the wall of the thorax, thus assisting the internal inter- costal muscles. The abdominal muscles are called into play chiefly in violent expiratory efforts, such as coughing, sneezing, etc., and have a most important action upon the viscera during the acts of mictm’ition, defsecation, vomiting, and parturition. The rectus abdominis has the power of approximating the pelvis and thorax, as seen in rising from the supine position without the aid of the hands, or in climbing. When spasmodically contracted in tetanus, it pro- duces the bowed condition of the trunk known as emprosthotonos. The abdominal muscles are supplied by the lower six intercostal nerves, and by the ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal branches of the first lumbar nerve (Fig. 94). The abdominal wall having been finished on both sides, the dissectors should cut through the remains of the abdominal muscles in two or three places until the peritoneum is exposed, but without injuring the latter, in order to study the appearance of the mem- brane which forms the sac of a hernia. They should then open the abdomen and dissect the viscera together.CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 204 v. Bladder. e. Posterior surface of rectus. Cavity of the Abdomen.

The central cord is the obliterated urachus (m), those on each side of it are the obliterated hypogastric arteries (i), and the outside ones are the two epigastric arteries (&) seen through the wall. The peritoneum is raised into distinct folds by the obliterated hypogastric arteries, and external to the epigastric artery on each side may be seen a small dimple in the membrane, marking the position of the internal abdominal rings. The term “ Hesselbacli’s triangle ” (d) has been applied to the tri- angular space bounded by the border of the rectus internally, the epigastric artery externally, and Poupart’s ligament below, and it is through this that direct inguinal hernia forces its way. The fold of Douglas (c), or sharp lower margin of the posterior sheath of the rectus, will be readily perceived through the peritoneum. [By dividing the lower portion of the abdominal wall in the median line, it can be reflected on each side, and the abdominal contents will be exposed.] Abdominal Cavity (Fig. 106).—The parts first seen on opening the abdomen are the stomach and right lobe of the liver, with a small portion of the left lobe and the gall-bladder if distended, whilst the great omentum passing down from the stomach conceals the rest of the intestines. Should, however, the great omentum be turned up, as often happens, the mass of the small intestines will be visible, and immediately below the stomach the transverse colon. The ascending and descending colon will be more or less visible on each side, according to the amount of their distension. A very much distended bladder, or the pregnant uterus, would be visible at once, and the amount of liver and stomach which will appear will depend upon the healthy condition of those organs, and upon their not having been displaced by tight-lacing. For convenience of description the abdomen is divided into the following regions, by imaginary lines passing vertically from the seventh costal cartilage to the middle of Poupart’s ligament on each side ; and horizontally, at the level of the ninth costal cartilages and the spines of the ilium, respectively. In the centre are the epigastric, umbilical, and hypogastric regions ; and at each side the hypo- chondriac, lumbar, and iliac or inguinal regions. The position of the several viscera should now be noted and the different organs identified.CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 20G Fig. 106. Regions of the Abdomen. Bight Hypochondriac. Epigastric.

By drawing this end out from beneath the ribs, the spleen will be found attached to it, and will also frequently be found to be bound firmly to the diaphragm by old inflammatory adhesions. Tracing the stomach to the right side it will be found to terminate in the small intestine (duodenum), and the point of demarcation between the organs is marked by a thickened band of fibres, the pylorus. The duodenum can be traced for a short distance only at present. By drawing up the great omentum the transverse colon will be exposed crossing the umbilical region, and continuous on the right side with the ascending colon, and on the left with the descending colon, which should be traced out. Occupying the hypogastric region are the coils of the small intestine, two-fifths of which constitute the jejunum, and the remainder the ileum ; this may be seen to end in the large intestine in the right iliac fossa, where the commencement of the colon (caput caecum coli, or caecum) will be recognised by its little appendage, the appendix vermiformis. In the left iliac region will be seen the tortuous portion of the large intestine, called the sigmoid flexure, wdiich may be traced to its termination in the rectum at the brim of the true pelvis.

The condition of the intestines will vary so much according to the mode of death, that mere size is no criterion, the small intestines being occasionally distended to a much greater size than the large ; but attention to the following points will prevent all possibility of error. The cylinder of the small intestine is uniform throughout, and the surface is perfectly smooth ; the laige intestine on the contrary will be found to be pouched or slightly constricted at short intervals throughout, except the rectum. Moreover it will be seen to be marked by distinct bands of longitudinal muscular fibres, three in number, and in most subjects small pieces of fat (appendices epiploicse) will be found attached along the free border. In the healthy condition the large intestine is about as large again as the small intestine. The Peritoneum (Tig. 107).—The serous membrane covering the intestines is now to be traced, in doing which the student must bear in mind that he has already opened the cavity of the peritoneum, which was previously a shut sac. The best way to learn the peri- toneum is to trace it as simply as possible at first, and afterwards to study any complications. Beginning at the umbilicus, the membrane will be seen to line the abdominal wall, and so to reach the diaphragm; from this it is reflected on the upper surface of the liver, round its anterior margin, and on the under surface of the organ as far back as the transverse fissure. It then passes down to the stomach, forming the anterior layer of the gastro-hepiatic or lesser omentum, covers the anterior surface of the stomach, and is prolonged downwards over the intes- tines to form the anterior layer of the great omentum or epiploon. By turning up the great omentum, the peritoneum will be seen to be reflected upon itself to form the posterior layer of the great omentum, which is continued upwards until it meets with the transverse colon, behind which it is prolonged to the spine, forming the under layer of the transverse meso-colon. It is now carried over the mesenteric vessels to the small intestine and back to the spine, thus forming the two layers of the mesentery; and it can then be seen to pass over the abdominal aorta into the pelvis, where it invests the rectum (meso- rectum) and passes from that intestine to the bladder, forming in the male the recto-vesical pouch. In the female the peritoneum is reflected from the rectum to the upper part of the vagina, forming the recto- vaginal pouch (cul-de-sac of Douglas), then over the uterus and between the uterus and bladder, foiming the utero-vesical pouch. It is lastly209 THE PERITONEUM. carried over the bladder to the lower part of the abdominal wall and so to the umbilicus. What is called the greater lag of the peritoneum has now been Fig. 107. traced, but there is another pouch called the lesser lag placed behind it in part, and continuous with it through a hole or tube, the foramen Fig. 107.—Diagram of vertical section of the peritoneum (drawn by J. T. Gray). • The continuation of the greater with the lesser bag through the foramen of Winslow is marked by an arrow. L. Liver. J. Jejunum. B. Bladder. S. Stomach. P. Pancreas. U. Uterus. C. Colon.

This will he found by passing the finger carefully round the right border of the lesser omentum, immediately below the liver, when its point may be seen through the semitransparent double fold of the lesser omentum. To see the cavity of the lesser bag, an incision must be carefully made through the double anterior layer of the great omentum, when, if the parts are healthy, the bag will be readily opened and the finger passed through the foramen of Winslow will be clearly seen. Tracing it from the foramen, the membrane of the lesser bag will be formd to form the posterior layer of the lesser omentum, then to cover the posterior surface of the stomach, and to be prolonged down- wards to form the two internal layers of the great omentum ; after which it covers the upper part of the transverse colon and forms the upper layer of the transverse meso-colon. It then passes up over the pancreas to the under surface of the liver behind the transverse fissure. The Foramen of Winslow (Figs. 107 and 108) is simply a con- striction of the peritoneum dividing it into two parts, produced by the passage of the hepatic artery forwards and upwards to the liver. When the finger is in the foramen it will feel the following boundaries. In front, the lesser omentum containing the hepatic artery, bile duct, and portal vein ; behind, the right crus of the diapliragm and the inferior vena cava ; below, the hepatic artery (as it passes forwards from the aorta); above, the lobus Spigelii of the liver. It is sometimes preferred to trace the two sacs of the peritoneum together, which can be readily done in the following way. Be- ginning at the liver, one layer covers the front and the other the back of the under surface of the organ, and the two meet at the transverse fissure to form the lesser omentum. They then separate to enclose the stomach, uniting at its lower border to form the anterior two layers of the great omentum; being reflected upon themselves they next form the posterior two layers, which separate to enclose the transverse colon, forming the transverse meso-colon as they are prolonged to the spine. The two layers now leave one another, and the upper one (lesser bag) is prolonged over the pancreas to the under surface of the liver, where it commenced. The under layer (greater bag) forms the mesentery around the small intestines ; the recto-vesical pouch between the bladder and rectum ; and passes over the abdominal wall to the diaphragm, from which it is reflected on to the liver, where the description commenced. Besides tracing the peritoneum vertically as has been shown, it should be traced horizontally as follows. Below the level of the transverse colon the circle will be found to be exceedingly simple.FORAMEN OF WINSLOW. 211 Beginning at the median line of the abdominal wall, the perito- neum may be traced to the right iliac region, where it will be found to cover the front of the caecum and ascending colon (form- ing the meso-ccecum and ascending meso-colon) ; it then forms the mesentery around the small intestine, any portion of which will serve to show it; and lastly, covering the sigmoid flexure of the colon {sigmoid meso-colon) it is brought round again to the abdominal wall. A fold attaching the top of the descending colon to the under surface of the diaphragm (costo-colic, Jenner) should be noticed, since it passes below the spleen and influences the movements of that organ. Fig. 108. Above the colon the arrangement is a little complicated by the existence of the two sacs, the continuity of which however may thus be traced (Fig. 108). Beginning at the median line of the abdominal wall, the peritoneum may be traced into the right hypochondrium and over the right kidney; it then passes through the loop of the hepatic artery (foramen Winslowii), and across the body in front of the pancreas, then to the posterior surface of the stomach and back to the foramen again, where it forms the posterior layer of the lesser omentum. Reflected at this point upon itself, the membrane will be seen to form the anterior layer of the lesser omentum and to be con- Fig. 108.—Transverse section of the abdomen at the level of the foramen of Winslow (drawn by J.

The continuity of the greater with the lesser bag is thus evident, and the foramen of Winslow is seen to he merely the narrowed tube of communication between the two cavities. Besides the folds of peritoneum which have been named in tracing Fig 109. the membrane, there are others which form certain ligaments of the liver and bladder, and of the uterus in the female. Passing from the umbilicus to the Liver the obliterated umbilical vein or round ligament is seen, and around it is reflected a double fold of peritoneum, the suspensory or falciform ligament of the liver. This is prolonged on each side over the diaphragm and on to the upper surface of the liver, where it forms the upper layer of the coronary ligament; the under layer being formed partly by the lesser bag of the peritoneum, and the triangular surface between the two Fig. 109.—Female pelvic organs, seen from above (from Savage). a. a.

The doubled edges of the upper layer of the coronary ligament on each side are called the right and left lateral ligaments. The false ligaments of the Bladder are formed by the peritoneum ; they are five in number, two posterior, two lateral, and one superior. The posterior false ligaments are the margins of the recto-vesical pouch, and are. formed by the membrane being reflected over the obliterated hypogastric arteries. The lateral false ligaments are the pieces of peritoneum reaching from the bladder to the sides of the pelvis, and the superior is that passing over the obliterated hypogas- tric arteries and urachus to the umbilicus. In the female (Fig. 109), the pelvis is divided transversely by a fold of peritoneum reaching from each side of the uterus to the side of the pelvis, and called the broad ligament of the uterus ; in which will be found the ovary, the Fallopian tube, and the round ligament. It is by the open mouth of the Fallopian tube that the peritoneum has a communication with the mucous membrane of the uterus. The Uterus and Vagina intervene between the rectum and bladder of the female, and the peritoneum is prolonged from the rectum to the posterior wall of the vagina, and then over the uterus to the bladder, thus forming the redo-vaginal and utero-vesical pouches, the margins of which are the anterior and posterior ligaments of the uterus. In the child an arrangement may occasionally be found which is extremely rare in the adult—the posterior layer of the great omentum ascending directly to the pancreas, and then being again reflected to the colon to form its meso-colon. Mesenteric Vessels. [In order to dissect the mesenteric arteries, the great omentum and transverse colon must be turned up over the cartilages of the ribs, and the small intestines be drawn down. Beginning at the upper end of the jejunum (i. e., at the point where the small in- testine can first be distinctly seen), the dissector should remove the whole of the anterior layer of the mesentery as far as the edge of the bowel, where it is to be cut off. This must be continued along the whole length of the small intestine, and the mesentery will be found to pass obliquely downwards from left to right. After the vessels contained in the mesentery are cleaned, the under layer of the meso- colon must be removed in the same way to expose the vessels going to the large intestine.] The Superior Mesenteric Artery (Fig. 110, io) is the vessel which supplies the small and half the large intestines. A branch ofMESENTERIC VESSELS. 214 the abdominal aorta, it conies off immediately beneath the pancreas, and passes forward between it and the duodenum, giving off the inferior pancreatico-duodenal branch (13), which takes a curved course to the right, and between the head of the pancreas and the duodenum, Fig. 110. to anastomose with the superior ptancreatico-duodenal artery.

The branches to the small intestine form a series of primary and secondary loops, which inosculate freely with one another, and at last ramify in the submucous areolar tissue of the intestine. The branches to the large intestine take the course indicated by their names ; thus the ileo-eolic goes to the end of the ileum and com- mencement of the colon (caecum), the right colic to the ascending, and the middle colic to the transverse colon. Each of these arteries divides into primary loops, which spread out on each side, and inosculate with one another and with the branches to the small intestine ; and thus a free anastomosis is established from one part to another of the intestinal canal. Corresponding branches of veins mil be found running with the arteries, and opening into the Superior Mesenteric Vein (Fig. 114, 6), which unites with the splenic to form the vena port®. In addition, there may be found ramifying upon the arteries the branches of the superior mesenteric plexus, derived from the solar plexus of the sympathetic ; and interspersed are the lymphatic glands which receive the lacteals from the intestines. [The whole of the small intestines are to be turned over to the right side, and the remainder of the meso-colon is to be removed to expose the inferior mesenteric vessels.] The Inferior Mesenteric Artery (Fig. Ill, 9) will be seen to arise from the abdominal aorta about an inch and a half above the bifurcation, and to give off the left colic (10) to the descending colon the sigmoid (12) (three or four) to the sigmoid flexure ; and lastly, the superior hoemorrhoidal artery (13), which descends into the pelvis to supply the rectum. These arteries form loops and anastomose freely with one another, and moreover, the left colic inosculates with the middle colic of the superior mesenteric, and the superior haemorrhoidal with the middle lueinorrhoidal of the internal iliac artery. The Inferior Mesenteric Vein (Fig. 114, 1) will be seen to have branches corresponding to those of the artery, and anastomoses by its hsemorrhoidal branch with the middle hsemorrhoidal branch of the internal iliac vein. It passes upwards beneath the pancreas to join the splenic vein, and so into the vena portse, thus forming a communication between the two great venous systems. Branches of the inferior mesenteric plexus of the sympathetic may be traced upon the vessels. It may be noticed that the mesenteric veins never present dilatations, which is owing to their having no valves.SPLENIC ARTERY. 217 The Gceliac Axis. [The intestines are now to he replaced, and the liver fastened up to the ribs, either with hooks or, better, by a few stitches : the stomach being drawn down, the lesser omentum is then to be carefully removed.] Between the layers of the lesser omentum will be found three important structures, and in the following positions (Fig. 113). To the right and most in front is the bile-duct (7), to the left the hepatic artery (5), and behind and between the two the large vena portse (9). Behind the lesser omentum in the middle line will be found the short trunk of the Coeliac Axis and its branches, viz., the gastric (coronaria ventriculi), the hepatic, and the splenic arteries. The Gastric Artery (Fig. 112, 12), the smallest of the three, passes along the lesser curvature of the stomach from left to right, giving branches to both surfaces of that organ and to the oesophagus ; it anastomoses at the pylorus with the pyloric branch of the hepatic artery. Branches of the sympathetic (gastric plexus) may be traced upon it. Its accompanying vein opens into the vena portae. The opportunity may be taken to notice the distribution of the pneumo-gastric nerves to the stomach. The left pneumo-gastrie gives numerous branches to the front of the stomach and the right to the back of the viscus, and these can be generally seen through the peritoneal coat without further dissection. The Hepatic Artery (Fig. 112, 1) passes upwards and to the right side (thus forming the inferior and anterior boundaries of the foramen of Winslow'), and will be seen to divide into the right and left hepatic branches, which enter the transverse fissure of the liver. The artery gives off the 'pyloric branch (3) which has been seen to anastomose wuth the gastric, and a trunk which immediately disappears behind the duodenum and is called the gastro-duodenal (13). From the right hepatic branch the small cystic (7) artery is given off, which is distributed to the gall-bladder by two branches, one passing between it and the liver and the other along its free surface. The Splenic Artery (Fig. 112, 20) can now be seen only in part, taking a tortuous course behind the stomach and along the upper border of the pancreas to the spleen. [To continue the dissection it wall be necessary to remove the intestines which have been examined, by putting a couple of ligatures upon the upper part of the jejunum, and also upon theTHE CCELIAC AXIS. 218 upper part of the rectum, and dividing the intestine between the two ligatures at each point.

After passing behind the duodenum it divides into the right gastro-epiploic and the superior pancreatico- duodenal arteries. The Gastro-epiploica. dextra (23) runs from right to left along the great curvature of the stomach and between the folds of the great omentum ; it anastomoses with the gastro-epiploica sinistra of the splenic artery. The Pancreatico-duodenalis superior (17) will be found between the duodenum and the head of the pancreas, the latter of which it sur- rounds ; it anastomoses with the small branch from the commence- ment of the superior mesenteric artery called the pancreatico-duode- nalis inferior (Fig. 110, 13), and gives branches to both pancreas and duodenum. The Splenic Artery (Fig. 112, 20) can now be seen in the whole of its course to the spleen, near which it breaks up into four or five branches which enter the hilum or fissure on the concave surface of that organ. As it passes along the upper border of the pancreas it gives off small branches to it (pancreaticae parvce), and one (pancreatica magna) which runs along the whole length of the gland with the duct. It also gives small branches (vasa brevia) (14) to the great end of the stomach, and one large one {gastro-epiploica sinistra) (18), which rims along the great curvature to anastomose with the gastro-epiploica dextra of the hepatic. Upon the hepatic and splenic arteries are corre- sponding plexuses of the sympathetic. The Splenic Vein (Fig. 114, 3) is placed below its artery and lies beliind the pancreas. It receives branches corresponding to those of the artery, and also at about the middle of the pancreas, the inferior mesenteric vein. It is joined by the superior mesen- teric vein behind the head of the pancreas, the two forming the vena portoe. [The pancreas and duodenum should now be thoroughly defined, and the bile and the pancreatic ducts traced to their entrance into the intestine. If desired, the stomach may be removed by tying and cut- ting it near the pylorus, and at the oesophagus.] The Duodenum (Fig. 113, 11) is from eight to ten inches long (twelve finger-breadths), and makes a peculiar bend upon itself be- fore it passes beneath the mesenteric artery, to become the jejunum ;THE CCELIAC AXIS. 220 thus entering successively the right hypochondriac, the right lumbar, and the umbilical regions. The first or ascending portion reaches from the pylorus to the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, where it is in close proximity to the gall-bladder. It is covered both in front and behind by a pro- longation from the lesser omentum, and is therefore movable with the stomach. Behind it are the vena portae, the common bile duct, and the gastro-duodenal artery. The second or descending portion is covered in front by the perito- neum, which binds it to the surface of the right kidney, in front of which it descends for about three inches behind the ascending colon. It lies close to the outer side of the head of the pancreas, with the pan- creatico-duodenal arteries intervening, and into its posterior surface the biliary and pancreatic ducts open. The third or transverse ptortion is fixed to the abdominal wall at the line of attachment of the meso-colon, and therefore has no proper peri- toneal covering. It is crossed by the superior mesenteric artery and vein, and lying upon the vena cava, and upon the aorta between the crura of the diaphragm, it gradually ascends from the level of the third to that of the second lumbar vertebra, at the left side of which it becomes the jejunum. Immediately above it is the body of the pancreas with the pancreatico-duodenal arteries. This is the most fixed portion of the small intestine, and, owing to the weight of the remainder of the bowel, it is at the junction of the duodenum with the jejunum that laceration most commonly occurs in cases of abdo- minal injury. The Pancreas (Fig. 113, io, 13) lies transversely in the abdomen, occupying the right lumbar, epigastric, and left hypochondriac regions ; the head being embraced by the duodenum, the body cross- ing the aorta between the coeliac axis and the superior mesenteric artery, and the tail touching the spleen. It was covered by the lesser bag of the peritoneum, and from right to left it crosses the vena portae, the vena cava, and the aorta between the crura of the diaphragm; and then lies over nearly the whole length of the splenic vein, crossing the two mesenteric veins as they ascend to join it. The duct runs along the whole length of the gland to join the common bile duct, which lies in the groove between the duodenum and pancreas ; and the united ducts open very obliquely into the back of the second part of the duodenum. The Bile Duct (Fig. 113, 7) should be traced up to the liver, where it will be found to commence in the right and left hepatic ducts, which emerge from the transverse fissure ; these unite to form theTHE VENA PORT.R. 221 common hepatic duct, which is joined at an acute angle by the duct of the gall-bladder (cystic), thus forming the common bile duct or ductus communis choledochus. The bile duct lies between the layers of the lesser omentum to the right of the hepatic artery and portal Fig. 113. 19 21 23 22 20 IS 16 vein, and passes behind the first portion of the duodenum to join the pancreatic duct and open into the duodenum as described above. The Vena Portse (Fig. 114, g) is formed by the junction of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins behind the pancreas, about an inch and a half from the head and immediately in front of the vena cava, to the right of the median line. It is four inches long, and Fig. 113.—Duodenum (altered from Hirsehfeld and Leveille). 1. Round ligament of liver, 2. Great end of stomach (cut). 3. Gall-bladder. 4. Spleen. 5. Hepatic artery. 6.

It lies against the left supra-renal capsule and the diaphragm, and the tail of the pancreas touches its lower margin. The splenic vessels will be seen to enter the hilum or slit on its concave surface. Deep Dissection of the Abdomen. [The stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and spleen should now he taken away by dividing the oesophagus, bile duct, and vessels, and the liver should then he carefully removed in order to see the arrangement of the coronary ligament. The round and falciform ligaments should first he cut and the liver pulled down ; by carrying the knife along the attachment to the diaphragm the upper layer of the coronary ligament will then he divided, as well as the lateral liga- ments on each side which are formed from it. The vena cava and a part of the liver uncovered by peritoneum will now be exposed, the latter being attached to the diaphragm by areolar tissue, and when these are carefully divided, the right supra-renal capsule and the top of the right kidney will be brought into view. The vena cava must be again cut through at the lower margin of the liver, when it will only be necessary to divide the under layer of the coronary liga- ment (derived chiefly from the lesser bag of the peritoneum) to re- move the organ. The viscera should all be placed in a covered pan for examination during the time that the subject is turned. The Diaphragm is to be cleaned by stripping off the peritoneum, as far as possible in the direction of the muscular fibres ; and at the same time the inner surface of the flap of abdominal muscles still attached should be cleaned, in order to follow out the fibres of the transversalis. Care must lie taken not to puncture the diaphragm, and to leave the branches of artery and nerve ramifying on its surface. The crura or muscular slips on each side of the aorta must be carefully cleaned, and two tendinous arches over the psoas and quadrates lumborum muscles defined, for which purpose it will be well to detach the kidney and turn it over to the opposite side temporarily.] The Diaphragm (Fig. 115) is found to be arched after death, being concave towards the abdomen (particularly on the right side), owing to the fact that expiration is the last act of life, and rising to the level of the fifth costal cartilage on the right but the sixth on the left side. It arises from the back of the ensiform cartilage and from the inner surfaces of the six lower ribs, where it interdigitates with the transversalis abdominis ; also from the ligamenta arcuata, externa and interna, of which the internal one passes from the body to the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra, and the exter-deep DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN. 224- nal one from the same transverse process to the last rib ; the two crossing the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles respectively. The ligamentum arcuatum externum is only the artificially isolated border of the fascia covering the quadratus lumborum, which is the Fig. 115. anterior lamella of the fascia lumborum derived from the posterior tendon of the transversalis abdominis muscle (Fig. 108). The ligamentum arcuatum internum is formed solely by the poste- rior tendinous fibres of the crus of the diaphragm, and to it the fascia of the psoas is attached. The crura or pillars of the diaphragm arise from the front of the bodies of the upper lumbar vertebrae; the right crus is the larger, Fig. 115.—Under or abdominal surface of the diaphragm (from Wilson). 1.

All the fibres of the diaphragm are inserted into the central cordi- form or trefoil tendon, but the inner fibres of the crura decussate with one another and form a figure-of-8 before they pass into the tendon, ^hus surrounding the aorta and oesophagus. Openings.—There are three large openings in the diaphragm, viz., ^he Aortic, the (Esophageal, and the Vena Caval openings, and two or three small orifices in the crura for the splanchnic nerves and vena azygos minor, and also for the vena azygos major if it does not pass through the aortic opening. The Aortic and Oesophageal openings are in the loops formed by the crura, and the front or oesophageal one, which is also to the left side, is entirely muscular; but that for the aorta will be found upon dissection to become tendinous, owing to some deep fibreswhich pass transversely over the vessel. The aortic opening is strictly speaking behind the diaphragm, being bounded posteriorly by the vertebral column. The opening for the Vena Cava is more or less quadrilateral (fora- men quadratum), is situated in the right division of the cordifonn tendon, and is entirely tendinous. Through the aortic orifice pass the aorta, the vena azygos major, and the thoracic duct; through the oesophageal opening, the oesopha- gus with the two pneumogastric nerves ; through the quadrilateral opening, the vena cava inferior, which is firmly attached to the mar- gins of the opening, and also a branch of the phrenic nerve. The greater and lesser splanchnic nerves pass through a slit in each crus, and the vena azygos minor (if it exists) passes through the left eras. The gangliated cord of the sympathetic is continued into the abdomen from the thorax beneath the ligamentum arcuatum internum. The position of the diaphragm alters considerably during inspira- tion, for the muscle then becomes flattened, and slopes downwards and backwards so as to deepen the posterior part of the chest. The diaphragm is supplied by the phrenic nerves from the cervical plexus, which, after traversing the thorax, pierce the fibres of the muscle and are distributed principally on its under surface. Its arteries are the phrenic, from the abdominal aorta, on the under surface, and the mus- culo-phrenic from the internal mammary. This last will be seen when the upper surface of the diaphragm is dissected with the Thorax. [The vessels and muscles of the abdominal cavity are now to be cleaned. Around the aorta and its branches will be found a quantity of tough tissue, which is the sympathetic nerve giving off plexuses to Q22 G DEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN. tlie several vessels. The greater part of this may be removed, but the great splanchnic nerves should be traced to their termination in the semilunar ganglia, situated on each side of the aorta close to the dia- phragm, and closely resembling lymphatic glands in appearance; and the gangliated cord of the sympathetic on each side of the vertebrae is to be preserved. The vena cava inferior (a piece of which it will be remembered has been removed with the liver) is to be cleaned, and care must be taken not to cut off the right spermatic vein on its an- terior surface. The vein may be secured in its proper position with a pin if necessary. The kidneys and supra-renal capsules are to be dissected out and the vessels going to each defined, and the spermatic vessels should be traced out.] The Abdominal Aorta (Fig. 116) is the direct continuation of the thoracic aorta, and reaches from the last dorsal vertebra to the left side of the fourth lumbar vertebra, where it divides into the two com- mon iliacs. It was covered originally and quite superficially by the stomach, transverse colon, and small intestines; and was crossed more closely (from above downwards) by the pancreas and splenic vein, be- tween the cceliac axis and superior mesenteric artery; by the duode- num, immediately below the mesenteric artery; and by the left renal vein. Immediately below the renal vein the spermatic arteries lie in front of the aorta for a short distance, and lower down is the inferior mesenteric artery, from which the peritoneum was reflected over the aorta to the bifurcation. The artery lies against the bodies of the vertebra; and the anterior common ligament, and crosses the left lumbar veins. To its right is the vena cava, in close connection below but separated at the upper part by the right crus of the diaphragm, and deeply placed between the upper part of the aorta and the right crus is the receptaculum chvli, 'with the thoracic duct and the vena azygos major. To its left is the left gangliated cord of the sympathetic. Its point of bifurcation is a little below and to the left of the umbilicus, above which it may be readily compressed. Surgery (Fig. 1171.-—The abdominal aorta has been tied immedi- ately above the bifurcation for iliac aneurism, but without success. It may be reached by an incision prolonged above and below the tunbilicus, by which Sir Astley Cooper originally tied it, the perito- neum being necessarily opened in front, and again at the point of ligature ; or by an incision at the side similar to that for ligature of the common iliac artery, but larger, by which the peritoneum is turned forward and left unopened. Mr. Lane has proposed to apply the liga- ture above, instead of below, the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery, in order to preserve the anastomoses of that vessel.227 BRANCHES OF ABDOMINAL AORTA. The Branches of the abdominal aorta are—1. Phrenic or dia- phragmatic. 2. Cceliac axis (dividing into gastric, hepatic, and splenic). 3. Superior mesenteric. 4. Supra-renal or capsular. 5. Renal. 6. Spermatic (ovarian in female). 7. Inferior mesenteric 8. Middle sacral. 9. Lumbar arteries. 10. Common iliacs. The Phrenic arteries (Fig. 116, 2) ^re two small branches, which arise close below the diaphragm and ramify on its under surface, where they form a circle and anastomose with one another and with the internal mammary artery, giving also a branch to the supra-renal capsule. The veins open into the vena cava. The Cceliac Axis (Fig. 116, 4) is only half an inch in length, and divides at once into the gastric, hepatic, and splenic arteries (v. p. 217). The gastric and splenic veins open into the vena portse, but the hepatic veins which receive the blood from the vena portse as well as from the hepatic artery in the liver, open into the vena cava. The Superior Mesenteric artery (Fig. 116, 6) supplies all the small and half the large intestine (v. p. 213). Its vein opens into the vena portse. The Supra-renal arteries (Fig. 116, 7) pass, one on each side, transversely to the supra-renal capsule, the right going beneath the vena cava. In addition to this artery (middle capsular), the capsule is supplied by a branch from the phrenic (superior), and one from the renal artery (inferior). The right vein enters the vena cava, the left the renal or phrenic vein. The Renal arteries (Fig. 116, 9) arising on each side of the aorta immediately below the capsular arteries, pass transversely to the con- cave border of the kidney, the right going beneath the vena cava. The aorta being a little to the left of the vertebrae at this point, the right renal artery is necessarily slightly longer than the left, and the veins are t!ie reverse, owing to the position of the vena cava on the right of the column. The renal artery breaks up into three or four branches just as it enters the kidney, and one or more of them may pass in front of the vein, but as a rule the relation of the parts at the hilum of the kidney is (1) Vein, (2) Artery, (3) Ureter, from before back- wards. The renal or emulgent veins open into the vena cava, the left crossing the aorta. An additional renal artery not unfrequently arises from the lower part of the aorta, or from the common iliac artery. The Spermatic arteries (Fig. 116, 10) are two long slender branches which arise from the front of the aorta about an inch below the renal, and pass downwards to the internal abdominal ring and through the inguinal canal to the testes. The right crosses obliquely Q 222S DEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN. Fig. 116. Fig. 116.—Abdominal aorta and vena cava (from Henle). 1. Hepatic veins (cut). 2. Phrenic arteries. 3. Vena cava. 4.

In the female the spermatic arteries become the ovarian, and pass into the pelvis to ramify in the broad ligament of the uterus (Fig. 109, li). The spermatic veins take a different course on the two sides, the left opening at a right angle into the left renal vein, and the right opening directly into the vena cava ; which arrangement is said to account in part for the more frequent occurrence of ‘ varicocele ’ on the left side. Dr. J. H. Brinton, of Philadelphia, has demonstrated the existence of a valve at the caval orifice of the vein of the right but not of the left side. The great length of the spermatic arteries is accounted for by the fact that the testicles were originally in the abdomen, opposite the point where the arteries arise, and that as they descended the vessels necessarily became elongated. The Inferior Mesenteric artery (Fig. 116, 12) supplies the lower half of the large intestine (v. p. 216), and its vein opens into the splenic vein. The Middle Sacral (Fig. 116, 18) is a small branch arising at the bifurcation of the aorta and passing down into the pelvis along the middle of the sacrum. It anastomoses rvith the lateral sacral branches of the internal iliac arteries, and its corresponding vein opens into the left common iliac vein. The Lumbar arteries (Fig. 116,14), four or five in number, arise in a double row from the back of the aorta and pass transversely, close upon the vertebrae, beneath the gangliated cords of the sympathetic, and (jn the right side beneath the vena cava. Only small portions of these arteries can be seen at present, but when followed out each will be found to divide into an anterior and posterior branch. Of these the anterior runs between the abdominal muscles, and the posterior passes between the transverse processes to the muscles of the back, giving also a branch into the vertebral canal through the intervertebral foramen, which supplies the membranes of the cord, and ends in the body of the vertebra. The lumbar veins open into the vena cava. The Common Iliac Arteries (Fig. 116, 16) are the direct con- tinuations of the abdominal aorta, and extend from the left side of the fourth lirmbar vertebra to the sacro-iliac synchondrosis, where each divides into the external and internal iliac arteries. The right common iliac is a little longer than the left, and the relations differ on the two sides, owing, principally, to the fact that the two commonDEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN. 230 iliac veins unite to form tlie vena cava on the right side of the verte- bral column. Both arteries are covered in front by the peritoneum, and are crossed by the ureter near their termination, but the left is crossed in addition by the rectum and inferior mesenteric vessels. The left artery lies against the psoas magnus, but the right artery lies upon its own vein at the lower part, and crosses the vein of the opposite side above. The left common iliac vein will be seen to lie to the inner side of its own artery, and then to pass beneath the right artery to reach the vena cava, whilst the right vein is at first behind and then to the outer side of the right artery until it unites with the left. Thus both the veins lie to the right of their respective arteries. The only branches from the trunks of the vessels are small twigs to the iliacus muscle and to the ureter. The Vena Cava Inferior (Fig. 116, 3) lies to the right of the aorta, and in close relation to it except at the upper part. It is formed by the junction of the two common iliac veins on the right of the fifth lumbar vertebra, and lies on the right of the vertebral column as high as the liver; there it passes forwards to enter the posterior border of that gland, through which it reaches the quad- rilateral opening in the diaphragm. It receives the lumbar, right- spermatic, renal, right supra-renal, and phrenic veins, and as it passes through the liver the large hepatic veins open into it; and thus the whole of the blood of the abdomen and lower extremities is returned to the heart. The External Iliac Artery (Fig. 149, 3) reaches from the point of bifurcation of the common iliac to Poupart’s ligament, where it becomes the femoral, its direction corresponding with a line drawn from the umbilicus to a point midway between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine. It passes along the brim of the true pelvis, and is bound down to the psoas muscle on the outer side by a process of fascia, which includes both it and the vein, and must be removed in order to expose them. The crural branch of the genito-crural nerve lies close to the outer side of the artery, and the spermatic vessels lie upon it near Poupart’s ligament. The vein lies to the inner side of the artery in the whole of its course upon the left side, but is beneath its upper part on the right side. An inch above Poupart’s ligament one of the branches of the vein (circumflex iliac) will be seen to cross the artery, and close to the ligament the vas deferens hooks round the epigastric artery, and descends into the pelvis to the inner side of the external iliac- artery.SURGERY OF THE ILIAC ARTERIES. 231 Branches.—The epigastric and circumflex iliac arteries are given off just above Poupart’s ligament. The Epigastric artery passes upwards immediately outside the peritoneum, and enters the rectus muscle at its posterior aspect, to which it has been already traced (p. 202). The branches of the epigastric are pubic to the back of the puhes, cremasteric to the cord, and muscular. An abnormal branch of large size is frequently found coming off from the epigastric close to its origin, and descending into the pelvis ; this is the obturator artery, and its important relations to femoral hernia have been already described (p. 90). The vein joins the external iliac vein. The Circumflex Iliac artery takes a course outwards along Poupart’s ligament, and is at first immediately outside the peritoneum. It soon, however, pierces the transversalis, and a branch of it serves as the guide between that muscle and the internal oblique. The artery runs along the crest of the ilium between the muscles, and anasto- moses with the ilio-lumbar branch of the internal iliac and with the last lumbar artery. The vein has been seen to cross the external iliac artery an inch above Poupart’s ligament, to open into the external iliac vein. Surgery.—The operations of tying the iliac arteries cannot be conveniently practised on the subject, as the muscles of the abdomen would be necessarily damaged. The following is the usual mode of proceeding :— To tie the External Iliac artery, a lunated incision three and a half inches long is to be made about an inch above and parallel to Poupart’s ligament (Fig. 117, a). The tendon of the external oblique and the fleshy fibres of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles are to be divided in the same direction and to the same extent, and it is usual to divide the transversalis on a director to avoid the possibility of injuring the peritoneum. Care must also be taken not to divide the epigastric artery. The fascia transversalis, now exposed, is to be divided on a director, and the peritoneum is then to be carefully stripped up from the iliac fossa and turned forward with the viscera, the ureter and spermatic vessels generally adhering to the membrane and being therefore drawn out of the way. The finger can now reach the inner border of the psoas, at which the artery can be felt, but the sheath must he carefully opened before the needle can be passed between the vein and the artery. The vessel should be tied as nearly as possible midway between the origins of the internal iliac and epigastric arteries. The Internal and Common Iliac arteries may be tied through aDEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN. 232 similar incision prolonged to a length of about five inches (Fig. 117, b), or by one of similar length placed so that its centre is opposite the anterior superior iliac spine. The steps of the proceeding are the same as those for tying the external iliac, but the operations are more arduous, owing to the greater depth of the arteries and the conse- quent difficulty in reach- ing them. When the external iliac artery is tied, the circula- tion in the lower limb is carried on principally by the internal iliac, the branches of which (gluteal, sciatic, and obturator) anas- tomose freely with branches of the profunda femoris. In addition, the anasto- moses between the epigas- tric and the internal mam- mary branch of the sub- clavian, and between the circumflex iliac and the lumbar arteries, become greatly developed. If the internal iliac were tied, a return current would be established from the profunda femoris to the branches before mentioned, whilst the visceral branches would be supplied by free anastomoses from the vessels of the opposite side. When the common iliac is tied, the circulation in the limb depends mainly upon the internal mammary and epigastric, aided by blood brought circuitously from the opposite internal iliac to that of the same side, and thence to the profunda femoris. The middle sacral artery would also form a direct com- munication between the aorta and the lateral sacral branch of the internal iliac. The Kidney (Fig. 113, 14) may be roughly said to lie between the last rib and the crest of the ilium. It generally, however, reaches Fig. 117.—(From Fergusson’s ‘Practical Surgery.’) a.

The upper extremities of both organs are nearer the spine than the lower, and upon them are fixed the supra-renal capsules. It will be remembered that in front of the kidney was the peritoneum, with the vertical part of the duodenum and the ascending colon on the right, and the lower part of the spleen and the descending colon on the left side. The outer border of the kidney is convex, the inner or hilum concave, and the vessels entering at this border are the renal vein, renal artery, and ureter, which lie in that relation to one another from before backwards. The Ureter (Fig. 116, n) should be traced out, and will be seen to lie over the psoas muscle, to pass beneath the spermatic vessels, and, having crossed the common or external iliac artery, to disappear in the pelvis, where it will be afterwards traced to the bladder. The Supra-renal Capsule (Fig. 116, 5) is a small triangular yellow body, somewhat resembling a cocked-hat, placed immediately above each kidney and lying against the crus of the diaphragm. The vessels to it should be traced out, and one kidney and capsule are then to be removed and put aside with the viscera for rfter- examination. [The kidney being removed or turned out of the way, the fasciae covering the psoas, quadratus lumborum, and iliacus are to be defined, and afterwards those muscles are to be cleaned, all nerves pass- ing out of them being carefully preserved.] Fascia of the quadratus lumborum.—The anterior lamella of the fascia lumborum, which forms part of the origin of the transversalis abdominis muscle (v. p. 194), will be found to lie in front of the quadratus muscle; what has been described as the ligamentum arcuatum externum of the diaphragm being merely the border of this, artificially isolated. The Fascia over the psoas is a distinct structure, although connected partially with the fascia of the quadratus. It is continuous with the iliac fascia in the pelvis, and passes upwards over the psoas to be attached to the lower edge of the ligamentum arcuatum internum of the diaphragm, and to the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae from which the muscle takes its origin. It is owing to this fascia that “ psoas abscess,” the result of diseased spine, is conducted along the psoas muscle to the inner side of the thigh. The Iliac fascia covers the iliacus intemus muscle and is con- tinuous with the fascia over the psoas magnus, being strengthened234 DEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN. at the lower part by an expansion from the psoas parvus, when that muscle is present. The iliac fascia should he traced to Poupart’s ligament, beneath which it passes to unite with the fascia transversalis in forming the sheath of the femoral vessels (v. p. 87). The Psoas Magnus muscle (Fig. 118, 6) arises from the sides of the bodies and roots of the transverse processes of the last dorsal and all the lumbar vertebrae, and from their’intervertebral substances. A series of tendinous arches from which muscular fibres arise, con- nected with the intervertebral substance and upper border of each vertebra, will be seen to spring across the hollow in the side of the body to become attached to the lower border of the same vertebra and to the next intervertebral substance ; and thus the lumbar vessels are protected from pressure. The muscle passes along the border of the true pelvis in close relation to the iliac vessels, and disappears beneath Poupart’s ligament to be inserted by a tendon into the back of the lesser trochanter of the femur. The Psoas Parvus (Fig. 118, 4) is a small muscle occasionally found upon the front of the psoas magnus. It arises from the bodies of the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae, and ends in a long tendon, which is inserted into the ilio-pectineal eminence and part of the ilio- pectineal line, giving an expansion to the iliac fascia. The Iliacus Internus (Fig. 118, 8) lies in the iliac fossa, from the greater part of which it arises, as well as from the ilio-lumbar ligament and the base of the sacrum. A few fibres also are attached to the capsular ligament of the hip-joint. The fleshy fibres of the iliacus are united with the tendon of the psoas at its insertion into the femur. The psoas and the iliacus are flexors and rotators outwards of the thigh, but taking their fixed point below are flexors of the trunk upon the thigh. This is seen in dislocation of the femur downwards into the thyroid foramen, when the body is always bowed forwards owing to the tension of these nmscles. The psoas is supplied by the lumbar nerves, the iliacus by the anterior crural nerve. The Quadratus Lumborum (Fig. 118, 5) is the short muscle filling the space between the last rib and the crista ilii. It has its origin below, from the posterior portion of the inner lip of the crest of the ilium and from the adjacent ilio-lumbar ligament'; and ascends to be inserted into the lower border of the last rib, and by three or four slips into the tips of the transverse processes of the lumbar verte- brae. It is sometimes described as consisting of two distinct parts. The quadratus draws down the ribs and is therefore a muscle of expi- ration ; it is supplied by the posterior branches of the lumbar nerves.235 THE LUMBAR PLEXUS. Twelfth dorsal nerve (Fig. 118, 3).—Crossing tlie quadratus, and immediately below the ligamentum arcuatum externum, will be found a large nerve, the twelfth dorsal, which will be seen to disappear through the transversalis muscle, and must not be confounded with the branches of the lumbar plexus. The Lumbar Plexus (Fig. 118).—At the outer border of the psoas, and about midway between the last rib and the crest of the ilium will be found two small nerves (often united), crossing the quadratus obliquely and piercing the abdominal muscles immediately above the crest, and generally close together. These are the ilio- hypogastric (7) and ilio-inguinal (9) nerves, and their size varies considerably in different subjects, one being often larger than the other, or there being one trunk only which subdivides in the abdo- minal wall. The after-course of the nerves has been given in the dissection of the abdominal Avail, the ilio-hypogastric being distri- buted to the skin of the lower part of the abdomen and by its dorsal branch to the buttock, and the ilio-inguinal emerging from the external abdominal ring to supply the scrotum. The Genito-crural nerve (11) appears on the front of the psoas at its upper part, and is of small size. It descends on the muscle, and divides into a genital (29) branch which accompanies the spermatic cord through the inguinal canal to the cremaster, and a crural (27) branch Avliich runs under Poupart’s ligament to the outer side of the external iliac artery, and is lost in the skin of the thigh. The External cutaneous nerve (15) appears at the outer border of the psoas just below the level of the crista ilii. It crosses obliquely to the anterior superior spinous process, close to which it passes under Poupart’s ligament to the outer side of the thigh. (This frequently comes from the anterior crural nerve and is nearly transverse in its direction.) The Anterior crural (23) is the large nerve lying close to the outer border of the psoas at its lower part, and imbedded in the iliaeus. It passes under Poupart’s ligament into the thigh, but in the abdomen gives branches to the iliaeus intemus muscle. The Obturator nerve (25) will be better dissected with the pel Ads, but if desired may be seen passing beloAv the brim of the true pelvis, to disappear through the upper part of the thyroid foramen. An Accessory Obturator nerve is occasionally found arising with the obturator nerve, which is then diminished in size. The accessory nerve passes over the brim of the pelvis beneath the psoas, and joins, the obturator nerve on the inner side of the thigh.236 DEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN. [The psoas should he carefully removed piecemeal on one side, in order to dissect the lumbar nerves to their origins, and to trace out the plexus completely.] The Lumbar plexus will now be seen to be formed by the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and part of the 4th lumbar nerves, with a branch from the 12th Fig. 118.

The several nervous trunks unite more or less,, and from them the nerves are given off thus :—from the 1st the ilio- hypogastric and the ilio inguinal nerves ; from the 1st and 2nd the genito-crural nerve; from the 2nd and 3rd the external cutaneous nerve ; from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th the anterior crural nerve ; from the 3rd and 4th the obturator nerve. Thus it will be seen that the origins of the nerves are very simple, a nerve being added or sub- tracted in regular sequence, as follows :— Sympathetic Nerve (Fig. 113).—On each side of the aorta and close to the crura of the diaphragm will be seen an irregular mass of a somewhat crescentic form, called the semi-lunar ganglion, and into it the great splanchnic nerve from the thoracic ganglia may be traced. The Solar -plexus is formed by fibres crossing from one semi-lunar ganglion to the other, and receives a branch from the right pneumo- gastric. Its continuation, the aortic plexus, will have been mere or less seen in cleaning the aorta, and so also the secondary plexuses derived from it and distributed upon the several branches, viz., the phrenic plexus, gastric plexus, hepatic plexus, splenic plexus, superior mesenteric plexus, supra-renal plexus, renal plexus, spermatic plexus, and inferior mesenteric plexus. In addition to the great splanchnic nerve, the lesser splanchnic nerve may, in a favourable subject, be trJfced into the eoeliac plexus, and the third or least splanchnic nerve into the renal plexus. The Gangliated Cord of the Sympathetic (Fig. 118, i) will be found on each side of the spinal column, and behind the vena cava upon the right side. A ganglion is situated opposite each vertebra, and branches of communication may be traced from each, which may be divided into (1) those communicating with the ganglia above and below ; (2) those communicating with the spinal nerves, which are often two in number and join the nerves above and below each ganglion ; (3) branches to the plexuses upon the neighbouring- arteries supplying the viscera. Some lymphatic glands (lumbar) may also be found by the side of the aorta at the lower part, which receive the lymphatics from the testis, and are therefore affected in malignant diseases of that 1 . . .

It passes through the aortic opening. The Vena Azygos Minor (if it exists) may be seen to commence in the left lumbar veins, and to pass through the left crus of the ■diaphragm. Receptaculum Chyli.—By detaching the right crus of the dia- phragm from the vertebra1, and if necessary, removing a piece of the aorta opposite the upper lumbar vertebrae, the receptaculum chyli, an irregular tube about two inches long, will be seen lying to the right side of the aorta, opposite the second lumbar vertebra. It receives the lymphatics and lacteals of the abdomen, and is continued upwards as the thoracic duct. The subject will now be turned for the dissection of the back, and the dissectors of the abdomen should occupy the time with the examination of the viscera. Viscera of the Abdomen. [The stomach and intestines should be cleaned by allowing a stream of water to pass through them ; and the stomach, as well as a piece of small and large intestine, should be distended with air by means of a blow-pipe, so as to permit of dissection of its coats.] The Stomach (Fig. 119) presents a lesser and a greater curvature at its upper and lower borders, and a greater and lesser end. The great end is the dilatation on the left side of the body near the en- trance of the oesophagus, and is called the cardiac or splenic end, or sometimes known as the fundus. The small or pyloric end presents a small dilatation called the antrum of the pylorus, and terminates in the duodenum, the junction of the two viscera being marked by a thickened band of fibres which can both be seen and felt, and is called the pylorus. The coats of the stomach are four—serous, muscular, areolar, and mucous. The serous coat is continuous with the lesser omentum above, and with the great omentum below ; that in front of the stomach being derived from the greater bag, and that behind from the lesser bag of the peritonenm. Along the lesser and greater curvatures the two layers of peritoneum are separated by the pyloric and gastro-epiploic vessels. The muscular coat consists of three sets of unstriped fibres, longi- tudinal, circular and oblique. The longitudinal fibres are continuous239 THE STOMACH. with those of the oesophagus, and, running principally along the lesser curvature, are continued into the duodenum. The circular fibres, which are next in order, enclose the entire viscus, and are collected together at the small end to form the pylorus. The oblique fibres are most internal, and are continuous with the circular fibres of the Fig. 119. oesophagus; they are distributed principally over the great end of the stomach. The areolar or sub-mucous coat consists of areolar tissue in which the blood-vessels ramify, and between this and the mucous coat is a fine layer of involuntary muscle the muscularis mucosce. Oft laying open the stomach along its lesser curvature, the mucous membrane will be seen to be arranged in longitudinal folds or ridges called rugce, which disappear when the viscus is distended and are Fig. 119.—Vertical and longitudinal section of the stomach and duodenum (from Wilson). 1.

By inverting the pyloric end the pylorus or pyloric valve will he seen, a ring of the mucous membrane being projected by a set of strong circular fibres, surrounding the intestine and acting as a sphincter muscle. The mucous membrane is thick and soft, and of a pink colour when recent; it is thickest near the pylorus and thinnest at the greater end, which is the spot therefore where perforation, whether during life or from post-mortem digestion, takes place. Minute Anatomy.—The mucous membrane is divided into a series of shallow alveoli more or less hexagonal in form (stomach cells), at the bottom of which two or more tubuli (stomach tubes) open. These are arranged side by side (Fig. 120), their length being from i to ^ inch, and their diameter from 505 ggn inch; the epithelium of the alveoli is columnar. In addition to the simple tubes, there are in man near the cardiac end a few compound tubules having from two to five subdivisions (Fig. 121). The lower ends of the simple tubes and the sub- divisions of the compound tubes contain special peptic cells, and secrete the gastric juice. In addition to these near the pylorus are the gastric mucous glands (Fig. 122), mostly com- pound in man. In these the columnar epithelium of the alveoli is prolonged into the tubes nearly to the blind extremities, which are filled with granules. Lenticular glands or lymphoid follicles are scattered over the surface of the gastric mucous membrane. The Small Intestines extend from the pylorus to the ileo-csecal valve, averaging twenty feet in length, and have certain general characteristics in common; thus, they are of an imiform calibre throughout, and their external surface is smooth and regular. They have four coats, viz. peritoneal, muscular (longitudinal and circular), areolar, and mucous. The peritoneal coat is not found throughout, thus the first part of the duodenum is completely invested except Fig. 120.—Perpendicular section of the stomach in the pyloric region : showing its coats and the gastric glands; from the pig (from "Wilson, after Kolliker). 1.

The longitudinal muscular fibres are external, and the circular internal,* and they are both complete and continuous layers, the internal being considerably the thicker of the two. There is also a fine muscular layer (muscularis mucosa) between the areolar and mucous layers, as in the stomach. The mucous membrane has the following characteristics throughout—valvulce conniventes, villi, Lie- berkiihn’s follicles, solitary glands, and a columnar epithelium ; but the duodenum and ileum have certain special structures in addition. * An artificial aid to the remembrance of this fact is afforded by noting that lOngitudinal = Outer, and circular = Inner layer.

The Duodenum (Fig. 119) should he laid open along its free border, in order to see the opening of the bile ami pancreatic ducts, which is marked by a papilla situated at the back of the vertical portion of the intestine, and about or below its middle. A probe should be passed into the orifice and along the pancreatic duct. The duodenum is from eight to ten inches long, and has a special struc- ture (Brunner’s glands) in addition to the ordinary characteristics of the small intestine. Valvulce conniventes (or valves of Kerkring) are transverse folds of mucous membrane, which will be seen to commence a little beyond the pylorus, and to increase in size at the lower part of the duo- denum. Villi (Fig. 127, i) are the minute projections from the surface of Fig. 123. Fig. 124. Fig. 123.—An intestinal villus (from Frey). a. Columnar epithelium. c. Muscular fibres. b. Capillary plexus. d.

Each villus is a prolongation of the mucous membrane, formed of lymphoid tissue and covered with columnar epithelium. It contains in its centre a single or double lacteal, surrounded by a delicate layer of involuntary muscle prolonged from the mnscularis mucosce; external to which is a capillary plexus, with the basement-membrane on which the epithe- lium rests (Fig. 123). The capillary plexus is supplied by a small artery passing up one side of the villus, and ends in a vein running down the opposite side (Fig. 124). Lieberkiihn’s follicles (Fig. 127, 2) are minute tubes, which are placed between the villi, and resemble the mucous glands of the stomach ; they dip into the submucous areolar tissue, and are lined with columnar epithelium. Solitary glands, or lymphoid follicles (Fig. 126) are minute white round bodies, consisting of closed vesicles containing milky fluid and covered with villi. Brunner’s glands (Fig. 125), peculiar to the upper part of the duo- denum, are small lobidated glands situated in the submucous areolar tissue and having small ducts which open into the intestine. To see these it is necessary to pin out a piece of duodenum with the mucous Fig. 125.—Vertical section of mucous membraneof duodenum, showing Brunner’s glands (from Wilson, after Ecker). a.

[The jejunum and ileum (except a few inches to be left attached to the caecum) should be laid open along the line of attachment of the mesentery, so as to avoid damaging Peyer’s patches which are on the free border.] The Jejunum includes about two-tifths of the remaining small intestine, and is remarkable for the large size of the valvulse con- niventes and the number of solitary glands, but has no special characteristic. In the Ileum, the valvulse conniventes will be found to diminish rapidly in size, and to be wanting at the lower part. Peyer’s patches (glandules agminatce) (Fig. 127,4), the special charac- teristic of this part of the intestine, are from twenty to thirty in number, but vary much in size and are occasionally invisible. They will be recognised by their dotted appearance and by being of a lighter colour than the rest of the intestine, and are always found on the part of the intestine farthest from the attachment of the mesen- tery. Each patch, which may be as long as a couple of inches, is formed of a collection of the solitary glands or lymphoid follicles, wliich have however no villi on their surfaces. Peyer's glands will be found strongly marked, and sometimes ulcerated, in subjects which have died of typhoid fever. The Large Intestine (Fig. Ill) is between five and six feet in length, and is remarkable for the pouched appearance consequent upon its longitudinal muscular fibres being shorter than the intestine itself. These longitudinal fibres are arranged in three distinct bands, two of which can be seen through the peritoneum, and the third between the layers of the meso-colon. (In the rectum, which is not pouched, and the vermiform appendix, these fibres spread over the whole gut as in the small intestine.) The appendices epiploicm are small processes containing fat, attached along the free border of the intestine, and will be found to vary considerably in size in different subjects. The Caecum (Fig. 128, 1) (caput caecum coli) is distinguished by its rounded shape and by the opening of the ileum into it. It has attached to its lower and back part the appendix vermiformis, which is a little tubular prolongation terminating in a blind extremity. [The caecum, with a few inches of small and large intestine, should be detached, and the large intestine turned inside out to see the ileo-caecal valve. After this has been done and the intestine re-245 THE ILEOCECAL VALVE. inverted, the cut ends may be tied and the piece inflated and dried that the valve may be again examined in the dry condition.] The Ileo-ccecal valve (Fig. 128, 5) is formed by a prolongation of a piece of ileum through the wall of the crecum, to which it is firmly attached ; and being stretched from side to side, the small intestine Fig. 127. Fig. 128. forms two folds which project into the caecum and form the valve. The upper fold, which is horizontal in direction, is sometimes known as the ileo-colic, ancl the lower or more vertical one as the ileo-ccecal Fig. 127.—Section of the lower part of ileum of the calf, through a Peyer’s gland (from Wilson, after Kblliker). 1.

It is obvious that these folds permit the ready passage of fluid from the small into the large intestine, but would prevent regurgitation unless the parts were very much over-distended. The mucous membrane of the large intestine has no villi, for they cease abruptly at the free margin of the ileo-ccecal valve, but resembles that of the small intestine in having columnar epithelium and a muscular layer. Tubular glands resembling the follicles of Lieberkiihn, and solitary glands or closed follicles, embedded in the submucous tissue and having over them small depressions on the mucous surface, are found throughout the large intestine (Figs. 129 and 130). The Pancreas (Fig. 113) should be cleaned but left attached to the duodenum. It is about seven inches long, and the larger end, where it touches the bowel, is called the head, the central portion the body, and the small extremity the tail. Its average weight is three ounces. The pancreas is a compound racemose gland, and consists of lobules of a yellowish colour held together by loose fibrous tissue, a small duct passing from each lobule into the main *' Artificial memory, SHI P—Superior Horizontal, Inferior Perpendicular.

A probe being passed from the duodenum into the duct (canal of Wirsung), it should be dissected out, and will be found to pass along the whole length of the gland, and nearer the posterior than the anterior surface, a large accessory duct passing from the head. The pancreatic lies close to the bile duct, and the two pierce the duodenal wall together, opening usually by a common orifice. Occasionally there is a separate duct from the head of the pancreas opening into the duodenum by itself. The pancreas derives its blood from the splenic and from the superior and inferior pan- creatico-duodenal arteries ; its nerves from the solar plexus. The Spleen (Fig. 113, 4) is purple in colour and somewhat oval in form, and has a convex and a concave surface, with an anterior border which is sharp and slightly notched, and a posterior border which is thicker. On the concave surface is a vertical fissure, the hilum, into which the splenic vessels should be traced.

In this pulp, which consists of a reticulum of branched connective-tissue corpuscles (Quain), are found the Malpighian corpuscles which are special to the spleen, and are small vesicular bodies containing white semi-fluid matter, attached to the minute divisions of the splenic artery (Fig. 131). They are composed of lymphoid tissue derived from a transformation of the external or areolar coat of the small arteries, and average ^ inch in diameter. The arteries end in capillaries, which lose themselves in the connective tissue of the pulp, in the interstices of which the blood flows. The veins anastomose freely in and upon the trabeculae, and open into the splenic vein (Fig. 132). The Liver (Fig. 133) presents an upper and an under surface united by a thick posterior and a thin anterior margin. Its ordinary Fig. 133. measurements are, twelve inches across, six from before backwards, and three inches in thickness ; its weight is about fifty ounces avoirdupois. The upper surface is divided into two unequal parts, of which the right is the larger, by the attachment of the falciform Fig. 133.—Upper surface of the liver (from Wilson). 1. Right lobe. 2.

If the left lateral ligament he traced, it will he found to consist of a double fold of the peritoneum, which may he followed to the under surface of the left lobe. The upper layer of the coronary ligament, if traced outwards in the same way, will he found to be reflected upon itself to form the right lateral ligament, and then will he followed to the under surface of the right lobe of the liver behind the transverse fissure, to form the under layer of the coronary ligament. A more or less triangular Fig. 134. interval is thus left between the two, in which the liver is attached to the diaphragm by cellular tissue, and has the right supra-renal capsule and top of the right kidney in close relation with it, and through which the vena cava passes to the diaphragm. In this manner four ligaments of the liver are formed by peritoneum, the fifth or round ligament being the obliterated umbilical vein. The under surface of the liver (Fig. 134) presents five fissures and five lobes for examination. Fig. 134.—Undersurface of R. Right lobe. L. Left lobe. Q. Lobus quadratus. S. Lobus Spigelii. C.

Its continuation behind the transverse fissure is the fissxire for the ductus venosus (8), and contains that obliterated vessel. The transverse fissure (porta) is at right angles to the longi- tudinal, and gives passage to the hepatic duct (4), hepatic artery (3), and portal vein (5), which lie in that order from before backwards.* Parallel to the longitudinal fissure is the fissure for the gall-bladder (2), which last should be distended with air by a blowpipe placed in the duct. Placed obliquely at the posterior margin of the liver and behind the gall-bladder, is the short groove or fissure for the vena cava (7), a portion of which vessel has been left in situ. Lobes.—The whole of the liver substance on the right of the longitudinal fissure is strictly the right lobe (r), but certain parts of it have received special names, viz. lobus quadratics, lobus Spigelii and lobus caudatus. The right lobe has two shallow depressions on its under surface, the anterior one being where the ascending colon touches the liver, and the posterior one corresponding to the anterior surface of the right kidney, over which it lies in the erect posture. The Lobus quadratus (q) is the square lobe bounded by the longitudinal and transverse fissures and the gall-bladder. The Lobus Spigelii (s) is the projecting portion behind the transverse fissure, and between the fissures for the vena cava and the ductus venosus. The Lobus caudatus (c) is the small “ tail ” of liver substance which connects the lobulus Spigelii with the right lobe. The left lobe (l) is on the opposite side of the longitudinal fissure, across which there is often a bridge of liver substance (pons hepatis). The vessels entering the transverse fissure should be defined, and the fibrous tissue around them (capsule of Glisson) removed. The right and left hepatic ducts (4) will be found to emerge from the cor- responding lobes and to unite in the common hepatic duct, which is about two inches long; this is afterwards joined by the cystic duct from the gall-bladder, to form the common bile duct (ductus com- munis choledochus) (9), which is nearly three inches long, and should be traced into the duodenum. The gall-bladder (2) is a pear-shaped bag attached by cellular tissue to the liver, and covered superficially by the peritoneum. When distended, its large end or fundus projects beyond the ■* It will be observed that the order of vessels entering the liver is the reverse of those entering the kidney, q. v. p. 253.251 THE LIVER. anterior border of the liver ; the neck is curved upon itself twice and ends in the cystic duct, which is about an inch and a half long and joins the hepatic duct. The mucous membrane presents numerous ridges separating alveoli of irregular shape. The epi- thelium is columnar. The hepatic artery and the portal vein each divide into right and left, and from the right artery the cystic branch should be traced to the gall-bladder. The piece of the vena cava is to be laid open, when the large hepatic veins will be seen opening into it. In order to learn the arrangement of the vessels in the liver, the vena ports; should be carefully laid open for some distance with a pair of scissors. Through the thin wall of the vein a branch of injected hepatic artery will then be seen, and accompanying it is a branch of hepatic duct, the three vessels thus lying side by side in a 'portal canal. One of the hepatic veins being laid open in a similar way, will be seen to be totally unaccompanied. An incision into any part of the liver will show on its cut surfaces a number of openings, some wide open, —the hepatic veins; and others more or less collapsed and having by their sides the sections of a small in- jected artery and duct. These last are the portal veins lying in the portal canals, and they collapse on account of the loose attachment of the fibrous tissue around them. Minute Anatomy (Fig. 136).-—The blood from the chylopoietie viscera is brought to the liver by the vena portae, and from it the bile is secreted. The divisions of the vein have been seen to pass through the portal canals, in which they receive the vaginal and Fig-. 135.—Rabbit’s liver injected, showing a portal vein, with interlobular branches and plexus.

Fig. 136. capsular branches from the fibrous tissue of the organ, and subse- quently divide until their branches run between the minute lobules or acini, and are therefore called interlobular veins (b). The lobules are surrounded by these interlobular veins, from which the lobular plexus of capillaries is derived, converging to the centre of each lobule and pouring its blood into the intra- lobular vein (a). Each in- tralobular vein passes out of the lobule at right angles to the portal vessels, and unites with other in- tralobular veins to form the sublobular veins ; these open into the vence cavce liepaticce or hepatic veins, which have been traced into the vena cava. The appearance of a piece of minutely injected liver is shown in Fig. 135. The commencement of each primary hepatic duct is in the centre of each minute lobule, being continuous, according to Beale, with the basement membrane upon which the hepatic cells are placed. But according to other observers, the ducts commence in inter- cellular passages or biliary capillaries, with proper Avails (Fig. 137). The minute ducts run toAvards the circumference of the lobule, and the radicles of adjacent lobules unite, the resulting ducts running along the portal canals by the side of the portal vein to emerge eventually at the transverse fissure. The Hepatic artery is principally for the Fig. 137. Fig. 136.—Diagram of the circulation in the lobules of the liver (after Kieman). a, a. Intralobular veins. b, b. Interlobular veins.

It gives off vaginal branches which run in the portal canals, and capsular branches which supply the fibrous tissue on the surface, the blood being eventually returned into branches of the portal vein. The interlobular branches accompany the inter- lobular veins, and their blood enters the plexus within the lobules from which the bile is secreted. The Kidney (Fig. 116) is convex on its anterior and flattened on its posterior surface, and its upper extremity is somewhat larger than the lower. Its outer border is convex and regular, while the internal is notched at the point where the vessels enter. An average kidney measures about four inches in length, two-and-a-half in breadth, and rather over an inch in thickness. Its weight in the male is about 4-3>- ounces, and rather less in the female. The renal artery enters, and the renal vein and ureter emerge at a slit on the inner border called the hilum, and the trunks of the vessels have the following relation from before backwards, viz., vein, artery, and ureter (compare vessels entering transverse fissure of liver in the reverse order, p. 350). Very generally, however, one of the branches of the renal artery will enter the hilum in front of the vein. The ureter, if traced upwards, will be found to expand, forming the pelvis of the kidney, and it should be noticed that the pelvis has a direction downwards, so that by referring to this, to the position of the vessels, and to the flattening of the posterior surface, the side to which the kidney belongs can be readily ascertained. The kidney is enclosed in a tough fibrous capsule, which may be peeled off to see the kidney substance. To see the internal structure of the organ it should be opened through the convex border by a vertical incision, which is to be carried into the pelvis. The Pelvis (Fig. 138, 6) will be found to be subdivided at the upper, middle, and lower part of the kidney into three portions, which are called the Infundibula (5), and are again subdivided into the Calices. Projecting into the calices are small nodules of kidney substance termed the papilla: or mammilla? (4), which will be seen to be the apices of certain triangular dark-coloured bodies called the pyramids of Malpighi or cones (3). These pyramids, which are arranged more or less regularly side by side, constitute what is called the tubular or medullary substance of the kidney, the lighter granular portion at the margin of the section being the cortical substance (2). The renal artery breaks up into four or five branches, which again subdivide and pass between the pyramids to the cortical substance, forming arches between the cortical and medullary portion. FromVISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. 254 these the interlobular arteries arise, which pass between the sub- divisions of the cortical substance or pyramids of Ferrein and give oft Fig- 138. Fig. 139. the afferent arteries to the Malpighian bodies or glomeruli (Fig. 139). Each of these consists of a capillary plexus with an arterial twig (or afferent vessel) entering, and a venous radicle (or efferent vessel) leaving it, and these bodies are arranged along the arteries “ like Fig. 138.—Section of the kidney, surmounted by the suprarenal capsule (from "Wilson). 1.

The tube is convoluted in the cortical substance, and a secondary intertubular plexus is formed upon it by the venous radicle, after it has emerged from the Malpighian tuft. The tube then becomes suddenly smaller, and passes for a variable distance into the pyramid, again curving upon itself to reach the cortical portion, where the diameter increases and the tube opens into the straight or collecting tubes of the pyramids. These small tubes are .known as the looped tubes of Henle (Fig. 142). The uriniferous tubes of the pyramids converge at their apices, where they empty themselves into the calices ; from these the urine passes into the infundibula, and thence into the pelvis and ureter. The relation of the epithelium to the blood-vessels of the Mal- pighian body is uncertain. The capsule is lined with pave- Fig. 140.—Plan of the renal circulation (from Wilson, after Bowman). a.

The convoluted tubes are lined with similar flattened epithelium, but the looped tubes, as they increase in diameter, are tilled with granular epi- thelium. The large collect- ing tubes have a distinct columnar epithelium (Fig. 141). Between the straight tu- buli of the medullary por- tion are numerous straight arteries, which are recur- rent branches from the arches between the cortical and medullary substances, and these are joined by the straight efferent vessels of some of the deeper glome- ruli. The renal artery also supplies the fibrous cap- sule of the kidney with branches, which anasto- mose with the lumbar arteries from the aorta.

The Supra-Renal Capsule (Fig. 138, i) is irregularly triangular in shape, or is commonly said to resemble a cocked hat. Its height is from 1| to lj inch, and its breadth about 1 j- inch. It is enclosed in a fibrous capsule and on section will be seen to consist of two parts, cortical and medullary, the latter being generally broken down in the centre by decomposition so as to form a cavity. The cortical portion (Fig. 143) consists of polyhedral cells arranged in columns, radiating from the centre, and held in position by septa continuous with the fibrous envelope. The medullary portion consists of a very fine network of connec- tive tissue, containing cavities filled with cells, which are by some observers thought to be nerve cells, and continuous with the numerous branches of the sympa- thetic which go to the organ from the solar and renal plexuses. The supra-renal capsule is abundantly supplied with arterial blood from the phrenic, aorta, renal, and lumbar arteries. Its function is unknown. The subject being replaced on its back, the dissectors should pro- ceed with the examination of the pelvis, unless they were unable to finish the aorta, lumbar plexus, and iliac arteries before the body was turned, in which case they must revert to the dissection of them at once (v. p. 226). In any case the dissector is strongly advised to read through the dissection of the deep parts of the abdomen again, before proceeding any further. The Pelvis. [The pelvis with two lumbar vertebrae is to be separated from the trunk with the saw, when, by placing it on a table with the sacrum towards himself, the dissector will be able to get a better view of the contents than he has yet done. The cavity of the pelvis should be Fig. 143.—-Vertical section of cortical portion of supra-renal capsule (from Frey). a. Small, and b. Larger gland cylinders. c. Capsule.THE PELVIS. 258 carefully sponged out, and having removed the tow or cotton-wool from the anus, the dissector should let a stream of water run through the rectum. • The bladder should he emptied of any urine it may contain by pressure with the hand, and he moderately distended with air.] The Peritoneum (Fig. 147) should be examined first, and will be found to pass over the rectum, binding the upper part to the front of the sacrum (meso-rectum) ; from the rectum to the bladder forming the recto-vesical pouch, and thence over the back of the bladder to the abdominal wall. On each side of the recto-vesical pouch is a distinct fold of peritoneum, formed by the reflection of the membrane over the obliterated hypogastric arteries and the ureters ; these are the posterior false ligaments of the bladder. The peritoneum passing from the side of the bladder to the pelvis forms the lateral false ligaments, ' and the portion reaching to the back of the abdominal wall over the urachus -is’ called the superior false ligament of the bladder. Thus the false ligaments of the bladder, five in number, are all formed by peritoneum. In the Female (Fig. 109) the peritoneum passes from the rectum to the posterior wall of the vagina, forming the recto-vaginal pouch (Douglas), and then over the uterus to the bladder, forming the ntero- vesical pouch. On each side of the uterus it is stretched across the pelvis, forming the broad ligament of the uterus, which contains the round ligament, the ovary, and the Fallopian tube, the fimbriated extremity of which is to be noticed. The false ligaments of the bladder are the same as in the male, but are less distinctly marked ; the margins of the recto-vaginal and utero-vesical pouches have been named the anterior and posterior ligaments of the uterus. [The peritoneum is to be stripped off the upper part and sides of the bladder, but the recto-vesical pouch is not to be interfered with at present. By scraping away a little fat with the handle of the knife the pelvic fascia will be brought into view, but to examine it thoroughly the following dissection is to be made, in order to obtain a view from the outside. One dissector holding the pelvis firmly, the other is to clear away the remains of the adductor muscles on the right side of the pubes so as to expose the obturator externus muscle, which must then be carefully removed. Beneath the muscle will be found the branches of the obturator artery, forming a circle around the foramen and lying upon the obturator membrane or ligament, which gives passage to both obturator artery and nerve at its upper part. On removing the obturator ligament the fibres of the obturator internus muscle will be brought into view. With the saw a horizontal cut is now to be made from the upper margin of the obturator fora- men into the cotyloid cavity, and a similar one at the lower margin259 THE PELVIC FASCIA. of the obturator foramen, tlie extremities of the two cuts being about an inch apart in the bottom of the cavity. These are to be joined b}r a vertical cut with the chisel, and the piece of bone having been loosened with that instrument can be removed with the bone-forceps. With the chisel and bone-forceps the margins of the obturator fora- men may then be cut away so as to leave only a ring of bone. Tlie obturator interims being now fully exposed, should be carefully detached from the adjacent structures, and may then be readily removed by grasping the tendon with the bone-forceps and drawing the whole muscle out through the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. The outer surface of the pelvic fascia will then be exposed.] The Pelvic Fascia (Fig. 144) consists of several more or less distinct structures, which are however in many places continuous with one another. It is a single layer down to the level of a white Fig. 144.—Pelvic fascia seen from the outside (drawn by J. T. Gray). I. External cutaneous nerve. II. Poupart’s ligament. 3. Sartorius. 4.

This marks the point where the pelvic fascia divides into two parts, the redo-vesical and the obturator layers, and also forms a part of the origin of the levator ani muscle, the fibres of which can be indistinctly seen through the obturator fascia. The obturator layer (13) can now be seen passing downwards on the Fig. 145. inner side of the obturator internus muscle, to be attached to the spine and tuberosity of the ischium and great sacro-sciatic ligament, where it gives a covering to the pudic vessels and nerve ; and to the rami of the ischium and pubes, passing beneath the origin of the levator ani to the apex of the pubic arch (Godlee). A little above its attachment to the pubic arch it gives off a process which passes across Fig. 145.—Transverse section of the pelvis, seen from behind, showing the distiibution of the pelvic fascia (from Wilson). 1.

In addition, it gives a thin layer to the under surface of the levator ani, called the anal fascia (Fig. 146), which is lost on the rectum and external sphincter, and was seen in the dissection of the perinaeum. The redo-vesical layer is seen within the pelvis, and is continued over the internal surface of the levator ani to the bladder, forming the lateral true ligaments, and from the back of the pubes, forming the Fig. 146.

Anal fascia. anterior true (puboprostatic) ligaments of the bladder ; whilst between them it is seen to dip down to the prostate, of which it forms the capsule, and is thus continued from one side to the other of the pelvis, of which it closes the outlet. The recto-vesical fascia is continuous behind with the fascia covering the pyriformis, coccygeus, and sacral plexus, and on each side with the obturator fascia already described. The line along which the recto-vesical is continuous with the obturator fascia extends from the back of the pubes to the spine of the ischium, and corresponds to the origin of the levator ani muscle. This is com- monly known as the “white line ” (Fig. 144, 18), but is often wanting, the fibres of the levator ani passing upwards beyond the position of the white line, and thus separating the obturator from the pelvic fascia (Quain). A very distinct white line is always seen more Fig. 146.—Section of pelvis to show the pelvic fascia from the front (drawn by J. T. Gray).THE PELVIS. 262 internally where the sheath of the prostate begins, and corresponds to the lateral true ligament of the bladder (Godlee). Thus, the levator ani muscle is seen to be enclosed by the recto- vesical and anal layers of fascia; the ischio-rectal fossa to be lined by the obturator and anal layers ; and four of the true ligaments of the bladder to be formed by the recto-vesical layer,—the fifth being the obliterated urachus. In the Female the recto-vesical layer forms the ligaments of the bladder in the same way as in the male, but in addition gives a covering to the vagina. [A side-view of the contents of the pelvis is now to be obtained in the following way :— The left obliterated hypogastric artery with the vesical and haemorrhoidal arteries (and uterine and vaginal in the female) are to be severed, and the bladder and rectum turned as much as possible to the right side. The left lateral true ligament of the bladder is to be divided, and the knife carried through the subjacent levator ani muscle. A cut is then to be made with the saw through the pubes just external to the left anterior true ligament of the bladder, anti another is to be made through the whole length of the sacrum and coccyx just to the left of the middle line, which will neces- sarily divide the right common iliac artery and left common iliac vein. The sacrum may be conveniently sawn partly on its anterior and partly on its posterior surface, and the two cuts united with the chisel, by which time will be saved. The knife is now to be carried closely along the ramus of the pubes of the left side so as to detach the urethral muscles and triangular ligament, when by using a little force the pelvis will be divided into two parts, the right containing all the viscera, and the left the internal iliac vessels and sacral plexus of that side. A staff should be passed through the urethra into the bladder, which is to be moderately distended with air, and the rectum is to be carefully dis- tended with tow or cotton-wool, and secured by a string to the top of the sacrum or lumbar vertebra.] Side View of the Pelvis (Fig. 147).—Beginning in front, and supposing the dissection of the perinseum to have been made as directed, the bulb of the urethra (9) will be plainly seen lying in front of the triangular ligament or deep perinseal fascia (7), which has been purposely left untouched on the left side. The edge of the triangular ligament which has just been detached from the ramus of the pubes will be recognised, and immediately behind will be seen some pale muscular fibres, the cut edges of the compressor urethras (Guthrie). The staff may be felt through these as it lies in the263 SIDE VIEW OF PELVIS. membranous portion of the urethra, which by a little dissection will be exposed, and maybe seen in a favourable subject to be surrounded by circular muscular fibres.

It is seen to extend from the deep perinseal fascia or anterior triangular ligament, to the posterior layer of the triangular ligament derived from the pelvic fascia and continuous with the capsule of the prostate. It is nearly an inch in length and is not quite horizontal in its position, the anterior extremity being about an inch below the symphysis pubis, and the posterior a little lower. This is the portion of the urethra opened by the deep incision in lithotomy, and it should be noticed how much its position will vary according to the movements of the staff,—whether that instrument be hooked under the pubes or depressed towards the rectum. The Pelvic Fascia should be traced on to the prostate, bladder, and rectum, and the relations of those organs noticed. The Rectum (Fig. 147, io) is about eight inches long, and extends from the left sacro-iliac synchondrosis to the anus, lying a little to the left of the median line of the pelvis. It is divided into three portions, a superior or vertical, a middle or horizontal, and an inferior or vertical portion ; the upper two parts of the intestine being closely attached to the front of the sacrum and coccyx, while the third part passes through the levator ani and sphincter muscles to the anus, immediately in front of the tip of the coccyx. The peritoneum surrounds the first vertical portion and binds it to the sacrum, forming the meso-rectum ; the membrane only covers the front of the upper part of the second portion as it forms the recto-vesical pouch ; and has no connection with the third part at all. (Thus the relations of the rectum nearly correspond to those of the duodenum as respects the peritoneum, v, p. 220.) The first part of the rectum has in front of it the recto-vesical pouch of peritoneum and bladder in the male. The bladder lies immediately over the second portion of the rectum, and between the two organs are the vesiculas seminales and vasa deferentia. The prostate is close above the commencement of the third portion of the rectum, but as the bowel turns down to the coccyx, an interval is left between it and the urethra, corresponding to the perineum proper or surface between the back of the scrotum and the anus. [The left vesicula seminalis should be dissected out that its posi- tion may be seen, and the vas deferens and ureter of the left side are also to be traced out; the recto-vesical pouch of peritoneum is to be laid open along the side so that its extent may be fully appreciated.] The Bladder (Fig. 147, 2) varies in position according to its state265 SIDE VIEW OF PELVIS. of distension, being in the anterior part of the pelvis when empty, but filling the pelvis and rising into the abdomen when distended. The neck of the bladder is the narrowed portion attached to the prostate, and the remainder of the viscus is termed the body. The upper part of the body is the apex or summit, to which the obliterated urachus is attached, and over which the obliterated hypogastric arteries pass to the abdominal wall. The base or fundus of the bladder is the lowest part of the organ, which is seen to rest on the horizontal portion of the rectum, with the vesicuke seminales and vasa deferentia intervening. The peritoneum is reflected from the second portion of the rectum on to the fundus of the bladder at the level of the entrance of the ureters, and is then continued over the back of the bladder until it is reflected over the urachus to the abdominal wall, leaving the anterior surface uncovered. It should be noticed how much the extent of bladder uncovered by peritoneum, both above and below, depends upon the distension of the viscus ; since, in the contracted state its anterior surface is in contact with the pubes, whilst in the distended condition it rises above the bone and is in contact with the posterior surface of the abdominal muscles, and thus tapping above the pube? without injury to the serous membrane is possible. The depth of the recto-vesical pouch will similarly be found to vary, the peri- toneum reaching nearer to the prostate when the bladder is empty than when it is full; consequently the operation of tapping by the rectum can be only safely undertaken when the bladder is distended. Cripps gives the average distance of the recto-vesical pouch from the anus as 2k inches when both rectum and bladder are empty, and Sc- inches when the bladder is distended. The left Ureter (Fig. 147, 12) descending from the kidney is contained in the posterior false ligament of the bladder, and can now be traced beneath the peritoneum to its entrance into the posterior part of the fundus of the bladder, at a point nearly opposite the posterior extremity of the vesicula seminalis. The left Vas Deferens (Fig. 147, 8) can be traced from the testicle, and has been seen to turn down into the pelvis to the inner side of the external iliac artery, after leaving the inguinal canal. It is now seen to wind over the back of the bladder, crossing the oblite- rated hypogastric artery, and to be continued beneath the peritoneum to the fundus of the bladder, where it hooks round the ureter to become internal to it; the vas will be afterwards traced to the prostate.26G THE PELVIS. The Prostate Gland (Fig. 147, 17) is now seen in front of the bladder, and enclosed by a process of recto-vesical fascia which forms the capsule of the gland. It is placed over the commencement of the third part of the rectum, and in front of, but below the level of, the bladder. In old age the prostate is frequently enlarged, in which case it presses upon the rectum as well as upon the urethra ; the latter passes through its substance nearer the upper than the lower surface. Within the capsule derived from the recto-vesical fascia is the special fibrous capsule of the gland ; between the two is the large prostatic plexus of veins. [A transverse cut is now to be made at the bottom of the recto- vesical pouch, which will allow the bladder to be drawn forward, when a little dissection will expose the surface of the viscus uncovered by peritoneum and lying over the rectum.] The portion of the base of the bladder uncovered by peritoneum is triangular in shape, and is bounded on each side by the vasu deferentia and vesiculce seminales ; the base of the triangle is formed by the re- flection of peritoneum at the line of the entrance of the ureters, and the apex is at the back of the prostate. It is here that the bladder is opened when punctured from the rectum. A process of the recto-vesical layer of pelvic fascia can now be traced between the rectum and bladder, giving a covering to those organs, to the prostate, and to the vesicuhe seminales. The Vesiculse Seminales (Fig. 147, 14) are two convoluted sacs, situated on the under surface of the bladder, and converging to enter the prostate close to the median line. They are somewhat expanded at their posterior extremities, which are about two inches apart and reach nearly to the recto-vesical pouch. They have the vasa deferentia lying close to their inner sides, and together they form the sides of the triangle mentioned above. The vasa deferentia become somewhat enlarged as they pass be- neath the bladder ; they lie close to the inner sides of the vesiculse, and the duct of each vesicula joins the corresponding vas deferens at the prostate, thus forming the common ejaculatory duct. In the Female (Fig. 148), the short urethra will be seen to pas3 obliquely upwards to the bladder ; and immediately below it is the vagina passing up to the uterus, which must be held in position by a string passed through its fundus. The rectum occupies the same position as in the male, but is rather larger ; and the peritoneum will be seen to pass from it to the posterior surface of the upper partSIDE VIEW OF PELVIS. 267 of the vagina, 'thus forming the recto-vaginal pouch, being then reflected over the uterus to form the utero-vesical pouch between it and the bladder.

The Bladder (Fig. 148, 4) closely resembles that viscus in the male, but is rather larger, and its fundus is in contact with the vagina instead of with the rectum. The Urethra (Fig. 148, 6) in the female is about an inch and a half long, placed immediately beneath the pubes and curved upwards slightly to the bladder. It may be said to correspond to the prostatic and membranous urethra of the male. The Uterus (Fig. 148, 18) is situated behind the bladder, and, if in its proper position and healthy, its upper end or fundus should not reach above a line drawn from the upper edge of the pubic symphysis to the lumbo-sacral articulation (Savage). The uterus is tilted slightly forwards so that its axis corresponds to that of the pelvis, and its lower end or cervix is received into the upper end of the vagina. The Broad Ligament (Fig. 109, b) of the uterus is the fold of peritoneum attached to each side of the fundus, in which are three partial subdivisions, viz., a superior in which is the Fallopian tube, an anterior in which is the round ligament of the uterus, and a posterior covering the ovary. The right round ligament of the uterus is now to be traced from the internal abdominal ring to the fundus of the uterus, but the Fallopian tube and ovary may be more conveniently examined with the uterus at a later period. The Vagina (Fig. 148, 12) is a curved tube of which the anterior wall is considerably shorter than the posterior, the former in the virgin rarely exceeding two inches in length, but the latter being nearly twice as long (Savage). It is in contact with the bladder in front, and with the rectum behind at the lower part, but the recto- vaginal pouch of peritoneum intervenes between the two organs above. The neck of the uterus projects backwards into the upper extremity of the vagina, and its lower extremity passes through the levator ani muscle and is surrounded by the sphincter vaginae. [The viscera of the pelvis being drawn down to the left, the internal iliac vessels and sacral plexus of the right side can be examined, and they should also be dissected on the left half of the pelvis, which has been preserved for the purpose. Opportunity may be taken to trace branches of the sympathetic nerve to the sides of the pelvic organs.] The Internal Iliac Artery (Fig. 149, 4) is a branch of the com-269 THE INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. mon iliac, from which it comes off at the sacro-iliac synchondrosis, and immediately passes into the pelvis. In the foetus the hypogas- tric artery, the direct continuation of the internal iliac in size and direction, passed forwards over the bladder to the umbilicus, hut it is now converted into a fibrous cord, which however is pervious for a short distance, and thus gives branches to the bladder. The inter- nal iliac is crossed by the ureter and closely covered by the peritoneum in front; behind it are the internal iliac vein and the lumbo-sacral cord, with a portion of the pyriformis muscle. At the upper border of the great sacro-sciatic notch it divides into anterior and posterior trunks, which give branches to the viscera and to the inside and outside of the pelvis. Branches (Fig. 149).—From the anterior division are given off three visceral and three parietal branches ; from the posterior trunk three parietal branches. Visceral branches.

The Superior vesical (7) arteries are small brandies from the unobliterated portion of the hypogastric artery, which are distributed to the upper part of the bladder. A middle vesical branch is some- times derived from one of these, and from another is derived the artery of the vas deferens, which accompanies the duct to the testicle and anastomoses with the spermatic artery. 2. The Inferior vesical, and 3, Middle lmmorrhoidal (16) arteries generally come off together, and are distributed to the under surface of the bladder and vesiculce seminales, and to the adjacent portion of the rectum. The middle hsemorrhoidal artery anastomoses with the superior hsemorrhoidal branch of the inferior mesenteric above, and with the inferior hsemorrhoidal branch of the pudic artery below. 4. The Uterine (8) and Vaginal arteries supply those organs, the uterine passing to the cervix and then giving branches to the body of the uterus.270 THE PELVIS. 5.

The distribution of the obturator artery out- side the pelvis has been already seen on the right side (p. 258) but may now be followed out on the left side. When the obturator arises from the epigastric artery, there is generally a small branch running in the proper position with the obturator nerve (?:. p. 91). 6. The Pudic (13) and 7, the Sciatic (14) arteries can only be seen for a short distance within the pelvis, as they lie on the pyriformis to pass through the lower part of the greater sacro-sciatic foramen below that muscle. The pudic is generally smaller than the sciatic, and a little in front of it, but the size and relation of the vessels vary. Supposing the perinaeum and buttock to have been dissected, the opportunity may be taken to trace the sciatic artery through the great sacro-sciatic foramen to its distribution outside the pelvis, and to follow the pudic in its course around the spine of the ischium, and through the lesser foramen to the perinseum, where it will be seen running close to the margin of the pubes. The three parietal branches from the posterior division of the internal iliac artery are, the gluteal, ilio-lumbar, and lateral sacral arteries. 1. The Gluteal (6) artery is a thick trunk, disappearing at once through the upper part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, between the lumbo-sacral and first sacral nerves and above the pyriformis. It supplies muscular branches and a nutritious artery to the pelvis, and is distributed to the buttock (p. 110). 2. The Ilio-lumbar artery passes into the iliac fossa beneath the psoas and iliacus muscles ; and then divides into a lumbar branch which anastomoses with the last lumbar artery, and an iliac branch which supplies the iliacus and the bone, anastomosing with the cir- cumflex iliac branch of the external iliac artery. 3. The Lateral sacral artery (often double) descends on the front of the sacrum, internally to the sacral foramina, to the coccyx, -where it anastomoses with the artery of the opposite side and with the sacra media from the aorta. In its course it gives branches which enter the sacral foramina, and to the pyriformis muscle. The Veins corresponding to the branches of the internal iliac artery open into the internal iliac vein, -with the exception of the ilio-lumbar and occasionally the lateral sacral veins, which join the common iliac veins. The internal iliac vein passes beneath its artery to the common iliac vein, which on the left side also receives the middle sacral vein.272 THE PELVIS. [The bladder and rectum are now to be drawn out of the pelvis as much as possible, to do which it will be necessary to divide the liga- ments of the bladder and the recto-vesical layer of pelvic fascia ; this will bring into view the structures which close the lower aperture or outlet of the pelvis.] The Floor of the Pelvis (Fig. 150) is formed by the following structures. In front the levatores ani of the two sides blend in the middle line, supporting and being closely connected with the pelvic viscera. Immediately behind these and separated only by a very Pig. 150.—Floor of female pelvis (from Savage). 1. Symphysis pubis. 2. Section of biadder. 3. Section of vagina. 4. Levator ani muscle. 5.

This foramen is closed by the pyri- formis muscle, above and below which vessels and nerves leave the pelvis. The Levator Ani Muscle (Fig. 151, 23) takes its origin from the back of the pubes, and from the front of the spine of the ischium ; between those points its fibres are usually attached to the white line marking the division of the pelvic fascia, and seen on the dissection of the fascia from without (Fig. 144), but occasionally the fibres arise from the pelvic fascia an inch above the white line, the obturator fascia being then a separate structure (p. 261). The anterior fibres pass beneath the bladder and prostate to unite with those of the opposite side in the median raphe of the perinseum, the name levator prostates being sometimes given to those fibres which pass beneath the prostate [in the female they are connected with the vagina] ; the middle fibres are inserted into the rectum and blend with the sphinc- ter ; and the posterior fibres unite with those of the opposite side in the median raphe behind the anus, and are attached to the apex of the coccyx. It is supplied by branches from the 4th sacral nerve, and by a branch from the anterior perineal nerve. The Coccygeus (Fig. 151, 34) is the little triangle of pale muscular fibres having its insertion into the side of the coccyx, and its origin (the apex of the triangle) from the spine of the ischium immediately behind the attachment of the levator ani, from which the muscle is separated by a narrow cellular interval. The coccygeus is intimately connected with the lesser sacro- sciatic ligament, which passes from the sacrum to the spine of the ischium. It is supplied by a branch from the 4th and 5tli sacral nerves. The Obturator Internus Muscle (Fig. 151', 19) has been de- stroyed on the right side, but on the left side of the pelvis may be seen both above and below the level of the fascial origin of the levator ani. It arises from the posterior aspect of the rami of the pubes and ischium immediately in front of the thyroid foramen ; from the inner surface of the obturator ligament; and from the surface of bone behind the foramen as far as the great sacro-sciatic notch. The fibres end in a tendon, which passes out of the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen to be inserted on the upper margin of the great trochanter of the femur, its deep smface being subdivided into four or five small tendons as it winds over the edge of the sacro-sciatic notch, which is encrusted with cartilage and lubricated by a bursa. It is supplied by a special nerve x274 THE PELVIS. derived from the junction of the lumbo-sacral with the first sacral nerve. [The pelvic viscera are now to he removed by carefully detaching the urethra and bladder from the pubes, dividing the levator ani, and severing the slight connections between the rectum and coccyx. The whole of the urinary and genital organs should be carefully pre- served for after-examination. The sacral nerves can now be dissected on both sides of the pelvis, and in order to see them clearly it will be well to remove the remaining branches of the internal iliac artery. All the branches of the sacral nerves should be preserved, and care be taken not to remove the gangliated' cord and hypogastric plexus of the sympathetic. The upper sacral nerves will be readily seen emerging from the foramina, but the fifth Sacral and the coccygeal nerve will be found piercing the coccygeus muscle close to the side of the coccyx.] The Sacral Plexus (Fig. 151) is formed by the upper four sacral nerves and the lumbo-sacral cord derived from the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves, which is seen descending into the pelvis. The several nerves as they leave the sacral foramina receive branches from the gangliated cord of the sympathetic, which is internal to them, and then lying on the pyriformis muscle they unite to form one large flat band, which is the plexus. This is seen to disappear through the great sacro-sciatic foramen immediately above the lesser sacro-sciatic liga- ment, and by looking at the outside of the pelvis, the dissector will be able to see the three nerves into which it divides, viz., Great Sciatic, Small Sciatic, and Internal Pudic ; and to trace the pudic nerve around the spine of the ischium and through the lesser sacro- sciatic foramen to the perinseum. Branches within the Pelvis. A couple of branches are given to the pyriformis, either from the plexus or from the sacral nerves before they unite. The nerve to the obturator internus (26) arises at the point of union of the lumbo-sacral with the first sacral nerve and, lying on the anterior surface of the plexus, passes with the pudic nerve through the sacro-sciatic foramina to the inner surface of the muscle, supplying in its course the gemellus superior. The nerve to the qiiadratus from the lower part of the plexus, or sometimes from the great sciatic nerve, passes out beneath that nerve close upon the hip-joint, and supplies the quadratus and the gemellus inferior (p. 113). At the upper margin of the great sacro-sciatic foramen will be seen the superior gluteal nerve (15), derived frorti the lumbo-sacral cord275 THE SACRAL PLEXUS. and one or two of the upper sacral nerves ; it passes out above the pyriformis with the gluteal artery.

These last can seldom be made out well, since the nerves them- selves are very small, and a quantity of fibrous tissue is mixed with them. From the 4th Sacral nerve a branch may be traced to its junction with the 5th nerve, and from the 4th also are derived visceral branches to the bladder and rectum which communicate with the sympathetic, and muscular branches to the levator ani and coccygeus ; as well as the licemorrhoidal branch which passes through the levator ani or between this muscle and the coccygeus to the perinseum, to supply the external sphincter. The 5th Sacral nerve communicates with the 4th and the coccygeal nerve, and terminates by piercing the coccygeus muscle, which it supplies. The Coccygeal nerve (6tli) also pierces the coccygeus muscle to end on the back of the coccyx. The Gangliated Cord of the Sympathetic (Fig. 151, 8) may be traced on each side of the sacrum internally to the foramina, and has upon it four or five ganglia-; the two cords unite on the coccyx in the ganglion irrvpar. Communicating branches are given to the sacral nerves and to the hypogastric plexus. The Hypogastric plexus is placed on the front of the sacrum, and is continuous with the sympathetic plexus upon the aorta. It is con- tinued forward upon the two internal iliac arteries to form the pelvic plexuses, which are placed on each side of the bladder and rectum. In addition there are upon the several hollow viscera plexuses from the sympathetic, parts of which are visible in the various stages of the dissection. They are derived from the pelvic plexuses, and are distributed over the branches of arteries supplied to the several viscera, receiving corresponding names. The Pyriformis Muscle (Fig. 151, 20) if not sufficiently well seen, may be more fully exposed by drawing the sacral plexus out of the sacro-sciatic foramen. It arises from the front of the sacrum between the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sacral foramina, from the great 30. Visceral branches (cut). 31. Inferior pudendal nerve. 32. Fifth sacral nerve. 33.

It is inserted into the upper border of tlxe great trochanter of the femur, and is supplied by branches from the upper sacral nerves. Pelvic Viscera in the Male. [The bladder with the urethra and the rectum having been removed as directed, should be laid on the table with the rectum uppermost, and that viscus should be filled with cotton-wool and cleaned, and its muscular fibres exposed.] The Rectum is about eight inches long and is generally largest just above the anus, which will be seen to be surrounded by the sphincter muscle. The arrangement of the peritoneum upon the rectum has been already described (p. 263), and the longitudinal muscular fibres will be now seen to differ from those of the rest of the large intestine, in being spread all around it instead of being collected in three bands. The internal or circular muscular fibres become thickened near the anus to form the internal sphincter muscle, which is best seen when the bowel is opened. The numerous arteries entering the rectum are derived from three sources—the superior hemorrhoidal artery from the inferior mesenteric, which may be traced to within three inches of the anus; the middle hemorrhoidal from the internal iliac; and the inferior hemorrhoidal from the internal pudic. The veins open both into the vena portce and the internal iliac vein. The intestine being opened along its unattached border, the mucous membrane will be seen to be smooth, except near the anus, where it is thrown into longitudinal folds by the sphincter. Here also it frequently happens that haemorrhoids exist. Three or four transverse ridges of mucous membrane (valves or folds of Houston) will be found from three to six inches above the anus, which occa- sionally cause difficulty in the introduction of a bougie or rectum, tube. [The rectum is now to be carefully dissected from the bladder, which is to be moderately distended with air, and the under surface of the penis and bladder being then placed before the student, he is to dissect out thoroughly the whole of the parts exposed.]MALE PELVIC VISCERA. 278 The Corpus Spongiosum Urethrae (Fig. 152, 20) is seen between the two corpora cavernosa penis, and behind the point where these bodies cease will be seen the bulb (21), from which any remains of the accelerator urinfe muscle should be removed. Behind the bulb is the slender membranous portion (10) of the urethra terminating Fig. 152. at the prostate (7), the under surface of which is now exposed with the vesiculce seminales (9), vasa cleferentia, and base of the bladder. On each side of the membranous portion of the urethra may be found, by careful dissection, a little yellow body of the size of a pea, Cowpeds gland (11), the duct of which opens into the bulbous portion of the urethra.

The dorsal vein may now he traced to its junction with the plexus of veins around the prostate and neck of the bladder. The Prostate (Fig. 152, 7) is shaped like a chestnut, having the small end or apex in front, and weighs in the adult something less than an ounce. The length of the organ from base to apex is in health from 1 j- to 1^ inch, and the greatest transverse diameter about If inch (H. Thompson); but these measurements undergo great variation in old persons, the subjects of “ enlarged prostate.” The prostate consists of two lateral lobes, the division between which is marked by a slight groove on the under surface, the projection in the floor of the urethra described by some authors as the third ox- middle lobe being the result of morbid changes. A little hollow in the centre of the posterior aspect, or base, receives the common ejaculatory ducts. The structure of the prostate is partly glandular and partly muscular, the fibres (of the unstriped variety) being con- tinuous with those of the bladder. The Vesiculae Seminales (Fig. 152, 9) are two membranous receptacles for the semen, attached to the under surface of the bladder immediately behind the prostate, from which they diverge. Each vesicle consists of a convoluted tube, which becomes straight at the base of the prostate, and joins the corresponding vas deferens to form the common ejaculatory duct, to be afterwards seen opening into the urethra. The Bladder (Fig. 152, 4).—The peritoneal coat of the bladder has been already dissected (p. 265). The muscular coat consists of three layers, external or longitudinal, middle or circular, and internal (submucous of Ellis), also longitu- dinal. The external layer, sometimes known as the detrusor urince, is attached to the anterior true ligaments of the bladder at the back of the pubes. It is continued over the bladder and joins the posterior part of the prostate. The middle layer consists of circular fibres, which form the sphincter vesicce around the neck of the bladder, and are then continued over the prostate. They become more or less oblique in their distribution over the bladder. The internal layer is continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the urethra, and is joined by the fibres of the ureters, which meet in the middle line and are also spread over the trigonum (Ellis). Sir Charles Bell described special muscular bands continued fromMALE PELVIC VISCERA. 280 the ureters to the back of the prostate, the existence of which as separate structures is doubtful. According to Dr. Pettigrew, whose beautiful preparations are in the museum of the College of Surgeons of England, the arrangement of the muscular fibres of the bladder is reducible to a series of figure-of-8 loops, the so-called circular fibres depending upon compression of the two halves of the figure,—thus 8 becomes 8. Beneath the muscular is the fibrous coat of the bladder, composed of loose connective tissue. [The bladder is to be opened along its upper surface by a longitu- dinal cut, which is to be continued with a strong pair of scissors through the upper surface of the prostate and the whole length of the urethra, in the latter portion being a little to one side of the middle line.] Interior of Bladder and Urethra (Figs. 152 and 153).—The mucous membrane of the bladder, if healthy, will be pale and more or less in folds throughout; except near the urethra, where is the triangular space called the trigone vesicate or trigonum vesicce. This space corresponds to that between the vesiculse seminales externally, and the sides of the triangle are about an inch and a half long, being bounded by the orifices of the ureters, which will be recog- nised as little slits in the mucous membrane. If a probe be intro- duced into one of the ureters, it will be seen to pass very obliquely through the coats of the bladder, with which it is firmly united. The epithelium consists of tliree layers, the uppermost being flat- tened, the middle pyriform, with the large end uppermost and the small end prolonged between the small rounded cells of the deepest layer. The Uvula vesicce is a small elevation of the mucous membrane at the orifice of the urethra, which is not often seen. The Urethra (Fig. 152) averages eight inches in length, and is divided into the prostatic, membranous, bulbous, and spongy portions. The Prostatic portion (Fig. 153) lies in the prostate and is about an inch and a quarter long. On each side of it will be seen the cut sub- stance of the prostate, which consists partly of glandular and partly of muscular tissue. At the bottom of the prostatic portion of the urethra is a ridge called the veru montanum or caput gallinaginis (5), dividing the canal into two hollows called the prostatic sinuses (8), into which the prostatic ducts open. On the veru montanum and near its posterior part will be found the sinus pocularis (6), a little281 INTERIOR OF THE URETHRA. blind poucli directed backwards, just within which are placed the orifices of the common ejaculatory duct.* The Membranous portion (a) is the shortest and narrowest division of the urethra, and being placed between the two layers of the trian- gular ligament which meet below, its upper wall is somewhat longer than its floor, the former measuring about § inch, and the latter £ inch (Thompson). The wall of this portion is thin and membra- nous, but it will be seen to be enclosed by circular involuntary fibres continuous with the circular fibres of the bladder and prostate. The mucous membrane is smooth, and presents no orifices ; it is fre- quently stained of a red colour. The Bulbous portion (d) is the part cor- responding to the bulb externally, and is about an inch long, but there is no line of demarcation between it and the spongy portion. The canal is dilated at this spot, and in the floor of it are the two minute orifices of the ducts of Cowper’s glands, which run obliquely through the wall of the urethra for some distance. The cut edge of the bulb will be seen to be con- tinuous with the corpus spongiosum, which surrounds the spongy or * The position of the sinus pocularis is given differ enty by various authors ; thus Quain, Gray and Wilson place it on the anterior, and Cruveilhier and Ellis on the posterior, part of the verumontanum. The discrepancy arises from slight variations in the shape and extent of the ridge.

The Spongy portion is the longest part of the canal, and averages five inches in length. Its calibre is somewhat smaller than that of the bulbous portion, hut it expands in the glans penis to form the/ossa navicularis, again becoming contracted at the meatus or orifice, at which point the urethra is as small as in the membranous portion, and occasionally smaller. Along the floor of the spongy portion are numerous mucous follicles or lacuna:, the orifices of which are directed towards the meatus ; a few similar follicles are situated on the upper surface of the urethra, one of which opposite the fossa navicularis is the lacuna magna. This can seldom be made out when the urethra is opened from above as here directed. The mucous membrane is smooth and pale in health, but the student should notice carefully any traces of stricture, which will probably be found, if present, in the bulbous portion. The epithe- lium of the posterior part of the urethra is columnar, but it becomes tesselated near the glans penis. Beneath the mucous membrane of the urethra there is a layer of longitudinal involuntary muscular fibre continuous with the sub- mucous layer of the bladder (Ellis), and intermixed with fibrous tissue. According to Hancock, circular muscular fibres also invest the whole length of the urethra at the same level. The Corpora Cavernosa Penis (Fig. 152, 14) are now seen to be two vascular bodies enclosed in fibrous capsules, which unite to form a median septum between them, known as the septum pectini- forme (16) from the comb-like appearance produced by apertures in it. The elastic capsule consists of two layers of fibres, longitudinal and circular, from which trabeculce or processes are distributed through the vascular tissue of the organ. The attachment of the corpora cavernosa or crura penis has been seen in the dissection of the perinceum. A transverse section of the penis (Fig. 154) shows the reticulated structure of the corpora cavernosa, and of the corpus spongiosum which Eig. 151.—Transverse section of the penis. 1. Dorsal vein. 5.

The dorsal vein, with a dorsal artery and nerve on each side of it, lie along the upper surface of the corpora cavernosa. The Testicle (Fig. 155) has already been seen in its position in tire scrotum, and its structure should now be investigated as far as possible, but cannot be thoroughly seen without mercurial injection. The testis consists of two parts, an anterior or larger portion, the body of the testis, and the accessory and more slender posterior part, the epididymis, which is to the outer side of the body, and from the lower end of which the ms deferens or duct arises. The testicle has three tunics or coverings. The tunica vaginalis (i) is a serous covering derived originally from the peritoneum, and described as consisting of two portions, the tunica vaginalis propria, which covers the organ, and the tunica vagincdis reflexa or re- flected portion. The tunica albuginea (2) is a fibrous covering enclosing the body of the testis, and sending into its centre a vertical process called the mediastinum (3) or corpus Highmorianum. From this, secondary processes or septa are derived, which separate the lobules of the testicle. The tunica albuginea is inseparably connected with the tunica vaginalis, thus forming a fibro-serous membrane. The tunica vasculosa (4) is beneath the tunica albuginea, and contains the ramifications of the blood-vessels, which cannot be seen except when finely injected. The Epididymis (Fig. 156) is divided into three parts. The upper extremity is the head or globus major (7), which is divisible into coni vasculosi; the central portion is the body (8), and the lower ex- tremity the tail or globus minor (9), which is larger than the body, but not so large as the head. From this the ms deferens (10) or duct of the testicle arises, and close to its point of origin may I'iic. 155. Fig. 155.—Transverse section of the testicle (from Wilson). 1.

On making a section of the uninjected testis, little more can be seen than a mass of a drab colour, which may be drawn out in threads, these being the minute seminal tubes. In an injected preparation the tubes may be traced as follows (Fig. 156) :— Each lobule is composed of convoluted tubuli seminiferi (3), which anastomose with one another, and these as they emerge from the lobules become straight, and are Lcallecl vasa recta (4), about twenty in number. Entering the mediastinum, they anastomose to form the rate testis (5), which terminates in the vasa efferentia (6); and these, from twelve .to fifteen in number, pierce the tunica albuginea to form the coni vasculosi (7) of the globus major of the epididymis. The ducts are now all collected into one, which by its convolutions forms the body and globus minor of the epididymis, and ends in the vas deferens, which enters the abdomen through the inguinal canal, and has been traced to its opening into the sinus pocularis of the prostate. Attached to the top of the testis immediately in front of the epididymis may generally be found a little vesicle called the hydatid of Morgagni, the remains of Midler’s duct; and in the cellular tissue of the cord, immediately above the epididymis, may be found a small white body, which has been supposed by M. Giraldes, who first described it, to be part of the remains of the Wolffian body of the foetus. Fig. 156. Fig. 156.—Anatomy of the testis (from Wilson). 1, 1. Tunica albuginea. 2, 2.

[The organs removed from the pelvis are to be laid out upon the table with the rectum upwards; this is to be cleaned, and after it has been examined is to be dissected from the uterus.] The Rectum (Fig. 148, 19) corresponds in all particulars to that of the male, but is sometimes much distended. The description of the rectum will be found at page 277. [The preparation being reversed, the bladder and urethra are next to be dissected and examined. The peritoneum is to be dissected up from the bladder and left attached to the uterus.] The Bladder (Fig. 148, 4) is more capacious than in the male, and is directly continuous with the urethra without the intervention of a prostate, the relation to the vesiculse seminales and vasa deferentia being of course wanting. The bladder is firmly attached to the neck of the uterus and front wall of the vagina. On each side of the upper part of the vagina the ureters turn upwards to gain the sides of the bladder, running obliquely for a short distance in the vesico-vaginal septum, then forwards obliquely through its coats to open by two orifices an inch and a half apart, about where they would open in the male (Savage). The structure of the bladder in the female corresponds closely to that of the male, which is given at page 279. The Urethra (Fig. 148, 6) of the female is a simple tube about an inch and a half long, the structure of which is best seen by laying it open with the bladder. The urethra is about a quarter of an inch in diameter, but is larger near the bladder, this being also its most dilatable portion. The mucous and muscular coats (circular and longitudinal) resemble those of the membranous urethra of the male. [The bladder and urethra are to be carefully removed, and the vagina and uterus exposed. The broad ligament of the uterus should be pinned out for the examination of the Fallopian tube and round ligament, and the preparation must afterwards be reversed for the dissection of the ovary, which is placed posteriorly.] The Vagina (Fig. 157, 5) has been seen in its position in the pelvis (p. 268) when the anterior wall was found to be shorter than the posterior, thus giving it a curved direction which is lost when the organs are removed from the body. The vagina is composed of longitudinal muscular fibres enclosing erectile tissue, and lined by a mucous membrane, which when the tube is opened will be seen to28G FEMALE PELVIC VISCERA. ligament, 13) is attached to the ovary, and serves to direct the tube form transverse rugce. Two longitudinal ridges, at the anterior and posterior surfaces of the vagina, have been named the columns of the vagina. At the upper part of the vagina the cervix uteri projects into its cavity, and the vagina will he found to he attached higher on its posterior than its anterior surface. At the lower end will be found the carunculce myrtiformes and remains of the hymen, and outside the vagina may he found the two small glands of Bartholin, the ducts of which open within the nymphse. The Uterus (Fig. 157, i) is more or less pyriform in shape, the fundus or upper part of the body being broad and somewhat flattened from before backwards, and the lower end or cervix being cylindrical. The cervix is perforated by the os uteri externum, (os tincoe), a trans- verse opening which divides it into two lips, anterior and posterior, of which the anterior is the thicker. [The anterior wall is to be divided vertically with scissors, and the cut prolonged on each side towards the Fallopian tube.] Immediately within the os uteri on the posterior aspect of the cervix, is seen a vertical ridge with oblique ridges radiating from it, producing the appearance known as the arbor vital. A similar appearance in the mucous membrane of the anterior surface of the cervix has been necessarily destroyed by the incision. Above the canal of the cervix is the os interum, wliich opens into the general cavity of the uterus. The cavity of the uterus is triangular in shape, the apex being downwards and the extremities of the base corresponding with the orifices of the Fallopian tubes. It is lined by a smooth mucous membrane, in which are the orifices of numerous small glands. The uterus is composed of pale unstripecl muscular fibre together with a large quantity of areolar tissue. In pregnancy the muscular fibres become much developed, and are divisible into three layers. The nerves of the uterus are derived from the hypogastric plexus of the sympathetic, and’ Dr. Robert Lee has described numerous ganglia on the surface of the organ, and believes that the nerves enlarge during pregnancy. The Fallopian Tube (Fig. 157, 9) is found at the upper part of the broad ligament on each side of the uterus, into the angles of wliich the two tubes open. Each tube is about four inches long and of very small calibre at the uterus, but gradually expands to form the fimbriated extremity, a trumpet-shaped opening surrounded by fringe-like processes (fimbricc). One of the fimbriae (fallopio-ovarianTHE OVARY. in grasping the ovule as it emerges from that organ. The tube is muscular in structure, and is lined by a mucous membrane with ciliated epithelium. The Round Ligament (Fig. 157, 8) placed in the anterior part of the broad ligament has been already traced (p. 268). It is com- Fig. 157. posed of unstriped muscular and areolar tissue, and is covered by peritoneum, which in the child can be traced for a short distance into the inguinal canal, forming the canal of Nuck. The Ovary (Fig. 157, ii) is an oval body situated in the posterior part of the broad ligament on each side of the uterus. In the young sirbject it is smooth and plump, but in the old subject it is shrivelled and scarred. It is attached to the fundus of the uterus by a slender cord, the ligament of the ovary (12), and has one of the fimbriae of the Fallopian tube attached to its surface (13). It is composed of a fibrous capsule (tunica albuginea) containing the Graafian vesicles, from which the ovules are discharged by a process of dehiscence or bursting, producing a cicatrix on the surface of the ovary, and within it a shrivelled clot called the corpus luteum. Between the Fallopian tube and the ovary, and contained in the broad ligament, are the remains of the Wolffian body, a fetal struc- Fig. 157.—Uterus with its appendages Wilson). 1.

It consists of a number of tubes with blind extremities. Connected with the lower surface of the ovary is a venous erectile tissue, to which the name of Bulb of the Ovary has been given by the late Mr. Beeves Traer, who first described it. This is supposed to maintain the ovary in its position, and to prepare it for ttlie grasp of the Fallopian tube during the passage of the ovule. Ligaments of the Pelvis. [The remaining soft tissues are to be removed from the halves of the pelvis and the several ligaments dissected out.] Articulation of the Vertebral Column with the Pelvis (Fig. 158).—The last lumbar vertebra is connected with the sacrum by the continuation of the several ligaments common to the vertebral column, and by an intervertebral substance, which is peculiar in being of greater thickness in front than behind. There are also two special ligaments, the lumbo-sacral and ilio-lumbar. The lumbo-sacral or sacro-vertebral ligament (2) is short, thick, and triangular, being attached to the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra above, and the upper border of the sacrum below. The ilio-lumbar ligament (3) is triangular, and passes horizontally from the tip of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra, to the crest of the ilium close above the sacro-iliac articulation. Sacro-iliac Articulation (Fig. 158).—The anterior sacro-iliac ligament (4) consists of short fibres passing between the anterior surfaces of the two bones. The posterior sacro-iliac ligament is composed of strong ligamentous bands, connecting the rough portion of the ilium behind the auricular surface of articulation, with the posterior surface of the sacrum ex- ternal to the posterior foramina. The oblique sacro-iliac ligament is a superficial portion of the posterior ligament, and reaches from the posterior superior spine of the ilium to the third lateral tubercle on the sacrum. When the ilium and sacrum are separated after the dissection of the other ligaments of the pelvis, a distinct layer of cartilage will be found between the two bones, with occasionally an intervening space, the joint being an instance of ‘ amphiarthrosis.’ Sacro-Sciatic Ligaments (Fig. 58).—These ligaments have been partially exposed in the dissection of the gluteal region.THE SYMPHYSIS PUBIS. 289 The Great sacro-sciatic ligament (2) is broad at its upper attach- ment, which is to the posterior inferior spine o? the ilium and to the sides of the sacrum and coccyx, and narrows to its insertion into the inner and back part of the tuberosity of the ischium. A portion of this ligament, by its falciform prolongation to the ramus of the ischium, has been seen to protect the pudic vessels and nerve. The Lesser sacro-sciatic ligament (3) is attached to the side of the sacrum and coccyx close to, but in front of, the great ligament, and reaches to the spine of the is- chium ; thus separating the greater from the lesser sacro- sciatic foramen. Articulation of the Sa- crum and Coccyx.—The ante- rior sacro-coccygeal ligament is a thin fasciculus, passing from the anterior surface of the sacrum to the front of the coccyx. The posterior sacro-coccygeal ligament is attached to the lower opening of the sacral canal, and passes along the whole length of the posterior surface of the coccyx. A small inter-articular carti- lage intervenes between the sa- crum and coccyx, and the cornua of the latter are connected to the former by short ligamentous bands. The Obturator Ligament (Fig. 158, 5) is a fibrous membrane filling up the obturator hole except at its upper part, where an opening is left for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve. It gives origin to the fibres of the obturator externus and internus muscles by its outer and inner surfaces. Symphysis Pubis.—The anterior pubic ligament passes in front of the two bones, the superficial fibres interlacing obliquely and the deeper ones running transversely. Fig. 158.

The superior pubic ligament connects the angles of the pubes. The sub-pubic ligament is a strong band passing from one pubic bone to the other, and arching beneath the symphysis. [To see the arrangement of the inter-articular cartilages, a vertical transverse section of the symphysis near its posterior part should be made with the saw.] An inter-articular fibro-cartilage covers the roughly-grooved surface of each pubic bone, the two cartilages being connected in front by strong elastic tissue, but separated posteriorly by a small cavity lined by a synovial membrane. This joint also is an example of amphiarthrosis.MUSCLES OF ABDOMEN.

[The Student is requested to read the ‘ Introduction’ before commencing the dissection, unless he has done so previously.] Before beginning the dissection the student should make himself fully acquainted with the external configuration of the part, and the relation of surface-markings to deeper structures. If he has already dissected this region, he should make the incisions necessary for ex- posing the common carotid artery and the third part of the subclavian artery, and may also advantageously perform the operations of laryn- gotomy and tracheotomy, and practise extraction of the teeth and the operation for plugging the posterior nares, which last can he done with a flexible catheter. The surface of the scalp presents nothing worthy of note, hut in a well-injected body the temporal artery will he prominent, and arteriotomy may he performed upon it. The superficial appearances on the face will he described more particularly under that head, and reference may he made to that section now if time allows. In the neck, the median line is the boundary of the dissection, and presents the following prominences and depressions, which should he fully recognised with the finger. First is the symphysis of the lower jaw, next a depression corresponding to the mylo-hyoid muscle, followed by the projection of the hyoid hone, the cornua of which can he felt distinctly on each side in some subjects. The depression corresponding to the thyro-hyoid membrane and the prominent pomum Adami of the thyroid cartilage are next felt, below which are the interval of the crico-thyroid membrane and the ring of the cricoid cartilage. Below this may occasionally he felt the isthmus of the thyroid gland or body, and even the trachea in a thin subject; and on each side there is (particularly in women) the slight projection of the thyroid gland.THE MUSCLES OF THE PINNA. 293 The crico-thyroid membrane and the trachea should be especially noticed as the positions in which laryngotomy and tracheotomy are performed. The clavicle and sternum bound the dissection below, and across the side of the neck the prominence of the sterno-mastoid marks the division into anterior and posterior triangles ; in an injected body the carotid artery may be felt near the middle of the anterior border of this muscle. The external jugular vein, if full of blood, will probably be seen crossing the sterno-mastoid obliquely, and may be opened secundum artem by an incision parallel to the muscle. It will be found to be impossible to dissect both sides of the head and neck simultaneously, and the students should therefore arrange to work together, and to take turns at dissecting and reading. The dissection of both sides of the scalp should be completed on the first day, in order that the brain may be removed on the second morning. The Scalp. [The head being shaved and raised on a block, one incision is to be carried from the root of the nose to the occiput, and another at right angles to it from the front of the ear across the head to the corresponding point on the opposite side, and the flaps thus marked out are to be dissected by beginning at the top of the head. Great care must be taken to remove only the skin and not the subcutaneous tissues, which are very thin ; the best guides are the roots of the hair, which should be exposed on the under surface of the flaps. The flaps having been turned down to the level of the brow in front, and the occipital protuberance behind, the dissector may, if he choose, attempt to define the small muscles of the external ear, which are seldom well developed.] The Muscles of the Pinna (Fig. 159) are the Attollens aurem (5) (superior), the Attrahens aurem (1) (anterior), and the Retrahens aurem (9) (posterior). The names sufficiently indicate their positions, and they are all inserted into the pinna, the anterior arising from the anterior part of the aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis, and being inserted into the helix ; the superior also from the middle part of the same aponeurosis, and inserted into the back of the pinna ; and the posterior from the mastoid process to the back of the concha. [The muscular fibres of the occipito-frontalis are to be cleaned both on the forehead and on the occiput, care being taken not to damage the intervening aponeurosis, or the nerves which pierce the muscle at several points.] The Occipito-frontalis (Fig. 159).—The anterior belly (2) has no bony attachment, but takes its origin from the fibres of the orbicularis294 THE SCALP. palpebrarum and the pyramidalis nasi, and is also connected with the corrugator supercilii on the face. The 'posterior belly arises from the outer half or two-thirds of the superior curved line of the occi- pital bone, and very slightly from the mastoid process of the temporal bone. Both bellies are inserted into the broad tendinous aponeurosis which extends over the top of the skull. The aponeurosis of the two sides are continuous over the top of the head, and are freely movable upon loose areolar tissue which intervenes between them and the periosteum of the skull. The occipito-frontalis wrinkles the fore- head transversely and elevates the eyebrows ; it is supplied by the facial nerve. Cutaneous Vessels and Nerves (Fig. 159).—In front of the ear will be found branches of the three divisions of the 5th nerve and branches of the facial nerve, together with branches of the ophthalmic and temporal arteries. Behind the ear are, a branch of the facial (posterior auricular), two branches of the cervical plexus (great auricular and small occipital), and a posterior branch of the second cervical nerve (great occipital), together with the posterior auricular and occipital arteries. The Supra-orbital nerve (8) [first cliv. of 5th] will be most readily found by feeling for the supra-orbital notch, and then cutting through the occipito-frontalis at that spot. It turns round the margin of the orbit at this point, and divides into two branches (inner and outer), which soon pierce the occipito-frontalis and supply the skin. The Supra-trochlear nerve (6) [first div. of 5th] is a small nerve which leaves the orbit at its inner angle, and then supplies the fore- head by piercing the occipito-frontalis. The Supra-orbital artery [ophthalmic] accompanies the supra-orbital nerve, and also gives superficial branches to the surface of the oc- cipito-frontalis muscle. The Frontal artery [ophthalmic] is of small size and accompanies the supra-trochlear nerve. The Supra-orbital and Frontal veins unite to form the angular vein, which is the commencement of the facial vein; they communicate freely with the ophthalmic vein. The Temporal branch of the Orbital nerve (io) [second div. of 5th] will be found with difficulty, as it is of small size. It pierces the temporal fascia immediately above the zygoma, and is distributed to the neighbouring skin. The Auriculo-temporal nerve (3) [third div. of 5th] lies immediately in front of the ear and close to the temporal artery. Emerging from the parotid gland it passes up the side of the head with the temporal295 VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE SCALP. artery, and, after giving branches to the external ear above the meatus and to the meatus itself, is distributed to the skin of the scalp. Temporal branches of the Facial nerve (4) [7th] will be found run- ning obliquely over the zygoma to the temple, where they join with the several branches of the 5th, already described, and supply the Fig. 159.

The Temporal artery [external carotid] is found in front of the ear, and after giving off small anterior auricular branches to the pinna and the middle temporal artery (which pierces the deep fascia above the zt'goma), it divides into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior lies upon the temporal fascia and is subcutaneous ; it reaches as far forward as the forehead to anastomose with the supra-orbital artery. The posterior turns back above the ear and anastomoses with the occipital artery. The Temporal vein is formed by branches corresponding to those of the artery, and disappears in the parotid gland to join the internal maxillary vein, and form the external jugular vein. Surgery.—It is on the anterior branch of the temporal artery that the operation of arteriotomy is performed when it is desired to abstract blood from the head. In the operation it is necessary to make only a puncture in the artery, and, rvlien sufficient blood has flowed, to divide the vessel, in order that the ends may be able to retract and prevent the formation of a false aneurism. The Posterior Auricular nerve (13) [facial] will be found immediately behind the ear and running over the mastoid process with an accom- panying artery. It is distributed to the posterior belly of the occipito- frontalis and to the attollens and retrahens aurem muscles. The Posterior Auricular artery [external carotid] accompanies the nerve in this part of its course, and is distributed to the pinna and to the skin behind it. Its vein opens into the external jugular. The Great Auricular nerve (23) [2nd and 3rd cervical nerves] ascends to the pinna, to which it gives numerous branches, principally on its posterior surface, forming a junction with the posterior auricular nerve. The Small Occipital nerve (11) [2nd cervical nerve] will be found about an inch behind the mastoid process and jrrst at the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid. It is a small nerve, and passes directly upwards to the scalp, which it supplies—giving also occasionally a branch to the pinna. The Great Occipital nerve (15) [posterior division of 2nd cervical nerve] is a large nerve, and will be found piercing the trapezius muscle close to the occipital protuberance. Its branches lie over the 26. Buccal nerve (5th). 31. Superficial cervical nerve. 27. Splenius capitis. 32. Mental nerve (5th). 28. Masseter. 33. Platysma. 29. Sterno-mastoid. 34.

The Occipital Artery [external carotid] lies close to the great occip- ital nerve, but its relation to it is inconstant. It ramifies on the back of the scalp, anastomosing with the artery of the opposite side, and with the posterior auricular and temporal arteries of the same side. The vein opens into the internal jugular. The Temporal Fascia will be fully exposed by removing the temporal artery and the branches of nerves over it. It is attached above to the temporal ridge on the frontal, parietal, and temporal bones, and below to the zygoma, where it is split so as to be attached to both lips of its upper border ; between the layers are the small orbital branch of the temporal artery and the temporal branch of the orbital nerve of the superior maxillary. It is pierced by the middle temporal artery and the temporal branch of the orbital nerve, and gives origin to fibres of the temporal muscle by its deep surface. The Temporal Muscle will be exposed in part by removing the fascia covering it. It arises from the temporal fossa and from the under surface of the temporal fascia, and its fibres are seen to con- verge to a tendon, which will be found to be inserted into the coronoid process of the lower jaw in a subsequent dissection. Removal of the Brain. [Both sides of the scalp having been dissected, the knife should be drawn round the skull, marking out a line an inch above the orbit in front, and half an inch above the occipital protuberance behind, and passing through the temporal muscle between those points. The outer plate of the skull is to be carefully sawn through, particularly at the anterior and posterior extremities of the temporal ridge, and at the occiput. With the chisel the remaining thickness of the skull can then be readily divided without injuring the brain, and the calvaria removed.] Upon Removing the Skull-cap the rough outer surface of the dura mater will be seen, and it should be noticed that it formed the internal periosteum of the calvaria, which will be found to be bare. The inner surface of the skull-cap presents a longitudinal groove in the median line, which corresponds to the superior longitudinal sinus, and on each side may frequently be seen depressions of variable size corresponding to the Pacchionian bodies. The groove for the middle meningeal artery will be seen on the inner surface of the parietal bone. The dura mater is cream coloured, but often has a bluish appearance, resulting from its translucency, which allows the veins of298 REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. the surface of the brain to he partially seen. On each side of the middle line will he seen the glandules Pacchionii, which are fibrous growths from the pia mater, and frequently project through the dura mater and indent the skull. Ramifying upon the dura mater will he found the large middle meningeal artery [internal maxillary], and in a well injected body the anterior meningeal [ethmoidal] may some- times he seen. The Superior Longitudinal Sinus (Fig. 160, i) should be opened at once. It runs along the middle line of the head, and will he seen to he triangular in section, being formed by a splitting of the dura mater and lined with venous endothelium. It commences in a small vein which enters the skull from the nose through the foramen caecum, and, running along the whole length of the upper border of the falx cerebri, it ends in the torcular Herophili. Within the sinus may he seen some small tendinous cords—chorda Willisii, and also the orifices of the veins opening into it, which all pass from behind forwards, i.e., contrary to the current of blood in the sinus itself. [The dura mater is to be divided longitudinally on each side of the sinus and turned down. By this the cavity of the arachnoid will be opened, and one layer of that serous membrane will be seen to line the dura mater, whilst the other is reflected upon the pia mater •covering the brain. By slightly separating the two hemispheres of the brain with the handle of the knife, the falx cerebri will be seen, and must be detached from the crista galli of the ethmoid bone.] Removal of the Brain.—The head being tilted a little back- wards, the anterior lobes of the cerebrum are to be raised, when the Olfactory nerves and bulbs (1st pair) will probably be detached from the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone with them, or if not, they can be readily displaced with the handle of the knife. The Optic nerves (2nd pair) of large size, will be seen close to the anterior clinoid processes, and should be divided, when the Internal Carotid Arteries will be brought into view, and must also be cut, together with the infundibulum attached to the 'pituitary body in the middle line. The 3rd pair (motores oculorum) will be seen piercing the dura mater behind and a little external to the carotid arteries, and after dividing these, the tentorium cerebelli will be brought into view with the 4tli nerve (patheticus vel trochlearis) just at its edge. The tentorium is to be divided on each side by carrying the knife parallel to the margin of the petrous bone, and the 4th pair will be cut at the same time. The tentorium having been turned aside, the remaining cranial nerves will be exposed, and must be divided,REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. 299 in their numerical order. The 5th pair (trifacial) will be found to be composed of two parts, the larger superior one being sensory, and the deeper one, which is anterior at its origin, motor in function. The 6th pair (abducentes) will be found nearer the median line. The 7th consists of two distinct nerves with a small intermediate portion. The anterior is the facial nerve, and the posterior the auditory, the intervening portion being called the pars intermedia. The entire nerve is seen to disappear through the meatus auditorius internus with an accompanying auditory artery. The 8th pair consists of three distinct nerves. The most anterior fibres form the small Glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which pierces the dura mater separately; the next and largest portion is the Pneumo-gastric or Vagus ; and the part coming out of the foramen magnum is the Spinal-accessory. The whole nerve disappears through the foramen lacerum posterius or jugular hole. The 9th (hypoglossal) nerve consists of two bundles placed near the median line, which pierce the dura mater at separate points to pass together through the anterior condyloid foramen. The Veins of Galen, which pass from the brain to the anterior border of the tentorium, should be divided so that the fold of dura mater may be quite free. The knife is now to be pushed through the foramen magnum so as to divide all the parts passing into the skull, viz., the spinal cord and its membranes, the two vertebral arteries, the small spinal vessels, and the two spinal accessory nerves ; and it should be noticed that the cord can be cut considerably lower than the point at which the vertebral arteries enter the spinal canal. The brain can now be lifted out of the skull, by slipping the fingers beneath the cerebellum and allowing the head to fall back. [Before placing the brain in methylated spirit, the dissectors should pick off the arachnoid and the pia mater from the base, and carefully lay out the nerves in the proper positions, taking care not to interfere with the arteries. The brain should be placed in a pan with the base upwards, and with a piece of calico bandage beneath it, so that it may be easily lifted out; but if too decomposed to be worth preserving, the vessels of the base should be dissected at once.] The Dura Mater and Sinuses op the Skull. The Dura Mater is firmly attached to the base of the skull, and sends processes through the several foramina to form sheaths for the nerves. It is continuous with the dura mater of the spinal cord through the foramen magnum, to the margin of which it is closely attached.SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. 300 The Falx Major (Fig. 160, 2) or falx cerebri is a vertical sickle- shaped process of dura mater placed between the two hemispheres of the cerebrum. Above it is convex and attached to the skull in the middle line, below it is free and concave and reaches towards the Fig. 160. corpus callosum. The superior and inferior longitudinal sinuses run along its upper and lower borders. It is attached in front to the crista galli of the ethmoid hone, and behind, where it is much deeper, it is attached to the internal occipital protuberance, and to Fig. 160.—Sinuses of the skull (side view) (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

The Tentorium Cerebelli (Fig. 160, 8) is the horizontal process of dura mater placed between the cerebrum and cerebellum, and when perfect it leaves only an oval opening of small size, through which the crura cerebri, the superior peduncles of the cerebellum and the posterior cerebral arteries pass. In front it is attached to the anterior and posterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid bone and the superior border of the petrous bone, and behind it is attached to the upper margin of the lateral sinus where it grooves the occipital, parietal, and temporal bones. The Falx Minor (Fig. 160, 14) or falx cerebelli is below the tentorium in the median line, and reaches to the foramen magnum, being attached to the median ridge of the occipital bone. It generally divides below, sending a slip to each side of the foramen magnum. The Sinuses are the venous canals of the skull into which the veins of the brain, orbit, and diploe empty themselves, and differ from the ordinary veins, (1) in not having the usual venous coats but being formed by layers of the dura mater lined with venous endo- thelium, and therefore remaining patent when divided; (2) in having no valves ; and (3) that the veins open into them in a direc- tion contrary to that of the current of blood within them. The Superior Longitudinal Sinus (Fig. 160, 1) runs along the upper border of the falx major (v. p. 298), and along its lower border is a much smaller canal, the Inferior Longitudinal Sinus (4). This begins about the middle of the falx and opens into the straight sinus. The Straight Sinus (Fig. 160, 10) must be opened along the line of attachment of the falx to the tentorium. It is formed by the venae Galeni of the brain and the inferior longitudinal sinus, and opens into the torcular Herophili, thus connecting the two longi- tudinal sinuses together. The Occipital Sinuses (Fig. 160, 18) are two in number, but of smaller size. They pass forwards one on each side from the torcular Herophili, and along the bifurcated attachment of the falx cerebelli, to the jugular vein. The Torcular Herophili (Fig. 161, 21) is the point where the superior longitudinal, straight, occipital, and two lateral sinuses meet. It is usually situated on the right of the internal occipital protuber- ance, but is sometimes to its left. The Lateral Sinuses (Fig. 161, 20) are the largest and, com- mencing at the torcular Herophili, take a curved course to theSINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. .302 foramen jugulare on each side. It will be necessary to cut through the tentorium in order to expose the cavity of the sinus, which grooves the following hones,—occipital, parietal, temporal, and the occipital hone again close to the jugular process.* The lateral Fig. 161. it sinuses receive the mastoid veins through the mastoid foramina, and end in the internal jugular veins, returning nearly the whole of the blood from the brain. The Superior Petrosal Sinus (Fig. 161, 12) will be exposed by running the knife along the upper border of the petrous bone, from * Artificial memory, OPTO.

It is of small size, and runs from the cavernous sinus hack to the lateral sinus, just where the latter turns downwards in the temporal hone. The Inferior Petrosal Sinus (Fig. 161, 14) will he opened by carrying the knife from the foramen jugulare, directly forwards along the lower border of the petrous hone to the clinoid process. It communicates with the cavernous sinus, and with the jugular vein outside the skull, passing through the foramen jugulare in front of the 8th pair. The Cavernous Sinus (Fig. 161, 8) is placed hy the side of the pituitary hody, and requires careful dissection on account of the nerves in relation with it. They are the 3rd, 4th, ophthalmic division of the 5th, and 6th, and their positions should he at once ascertained. The 3rd, of good size (1), will he recognised close behind the anterior clinoid process; the 4th, very small (3), in the cut edge of the tentorium ; the ophthalmic division of the otli, the largest and somewhat flattened out (5), will he seen immediately beneath the tentorium ; and the 6th, piercing the dura mater nearer the median line, upon the basilar process (9). [The left sinus will he found the most convenient for dissection, and should therefore he taken first. The 4th nerve is to he follow ed out carefully to the sphenoidal fissure by dividing the dura mater with a sharp knife, and the 3rd should he taken next. The dura mater over the 5th, having been freely divided, should be torn up. from the hone, hy which means and a very little dissection, the Gasserian ganglion and middle meningeal artery will he brought fully into view.] The Gasserian Ganglion (Fig. 161, 5) (Ganglion Semilunare) is the largest of the cranial ganglia, is of a pinkish colour, and is placed upon the tip of the petrous portion of the temporal hone. It is formed upon the larger or sensory portion of the 5th, and the smaller or motor portion passes beneath it. From the ganglion the three great divisions of the 5th are to he traced as follows :—The first or ophthalmic division to the sphenoidal fissure ; the second or superior maxillary division to the foramen rotundum; and the third or inferior maxillary division to the foramen ovale. The motor trunk of the nerve joins this last division outside the skull. The ophthal- mic division is seen to pass along the outer side of the cavernous sinus, and to give off a branch (nasal) before it enters the sphenoidal fissure. It also sends a minute recurrent branch (Arnold) to the tentorium cerehelli.304- sinuses OF THE DURA MATER. [The 6th nerve is to he followed by dividing the dura mater over it, and will be found to lie against the outer side of the carotid artery, where it makes its sigmoid turn at the side of the sella turcica. This vessel should be fully defined, and an attempt made to see the carotid plexus of the sympathetic upon it, from which a branch goes to join the 6th. It will render the dissection more useful if a small piece of the lesser wing of the sphenoid is clipped off with the bone forceps so as to open up the sphenoidal fissure, and the nerves can then be carefully followed to their entry into the orbit.] The 3rd and 4th nerves, and the first division of the 5th nerve, have been seen to lie in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus immediately beneath the dura mater ; and between them and the 6th nerve, which is placed against the carotid artery, is the venous canal through which the blood is returned from the orbit. This is very delicate, and can seldom be defined, but it receives the ophthalmic vein and opens into the two petrosal sinuses (Fig. 162). Fig. 162. 3rd nerve.. 4th nerve.. oth nerve.. 6th nerve.. Dura mater Venous canal. Internal carotid. The relation which the nerves hold to one another in the cavernous sinus is at first, from above downwards, according to their numerical order—i.e. 3, 4, 5, 6 ; and their relations to the sinus have been already described. Before they reach the orbit, however, they change their relative positions, which at the sphenoidal fissure are roughly as follows, from above downward—4, 5, 3, 6. If, however, the fissure has been opened up as advised, and the dissection be carefully made, the 3rd nerve before entering the orbit will be found to divide into two parts (between which the nasal branch of the 5th takes its course), and the 5th to divide into the frontal and lachrymal branches.

It mates a sigmoid turn by the side of the sella turcica, and then winds close behind the anterior clinoid process, where it was cut off in removing the brain. In a well-injected body, a few small branches (arteries receptaculi) may be seen in the cavernous sinus going to the dura mater; and the ophthalmic artery will be seen entering the optic foramen to the outer side of the optic nerve. Sympathetic Nerve. — A few filaments may be traced upon the carotid artery, forming the carotid plexus, which gives a branch of communication to the sixth nerve ; and the cavernous plexus may be found close to the anterior clinoid process. The Circular Sinus (Fig. 161, 6) surrounds the pituitary body in the sella turcica, and forms a communication between the two cavernous sinuses. Fig. 163.—Diagram of the nervea passing through the cavernous sinus (drawn by J. T. Gray). XPOSTERIOR TRIANGLE OF NECK. 306 The Transverse or Basilar Sinus (Fig. 161, io) crosses the basilar process at a variable point, and communicates between the two inferior petrosal sinuses. By displacing the Gasserian ganglion, a little groove in the upper surface of the petrous bone will be seen, in which are a small nerve and artery taking a course to the hiatus Fallopii, through which they disappear. They are the greater superficial petrosal nerve and artery, the nerve the continuation of the Vidian going to join the facial, and the artery a branch of the middle meningeal. Two small nerves may be found entering the temporal bone, to the outer side of the hiatus Fallopii; one, the small superficial petrosal, is the communication be- tween the facial nerve and the otic ganglion, the other, the external superficial petrosal, is derived from the sympathetic on the middle meningeal artery. Meningeal Arteries.—The Anterior Meningeal Arteries from the ethmoidal arteries, if injected, will be seen to enter the cranium through the ethmoidal foramina. The Middle Meningeal Artery can be seen entering at the foramen spinosum. It ramifies on the outside of the dura mater, grooving deeply the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone. The Small Meningeal is a branch of the middle meningeal artery, which enters the skull through the foramen ovale. The Meningeal Branch of the Ascending Pharingeal artery may be found perforating the foramen lacerum medium. The Posterior Meningeal Arteries are small branches of the occipital and vertebral, which enter by the foramen jugulare and foramen magnum respectively. Posterior Triangle of the Neck. [In order to dissect the posterior triangle, the blocks beneath the head should be removed, and it should be drawn downwards and to the opposite side and secured with hooks. The shoulders are to be raised to a convenient height by blocks beneath the scapulae, and the arm drawn down, and if possible secured in that position. The side of the neck is thus put fully on the stretch, and probably the external jugular vein distended with blood mil be seen beneath the skin. One incision is to be carried from the back of the pinna to the clavicle near its inner end, and another from this point along the whole length of that bone ; a third incision is to be made (if neces- sary) transversely from the pinna to the occiput, and the flap of skin is then to be reflected backwards. The dissection should be begun at the inferior angle, the dissector of the right side standing by the shoulder, and the dissector of the left side at the head, of the subject.]SUPERFICIAL BRANCHES OF CERVICAL PLEXUS. 307 Beneath the skin is the superficial fascia, and between the layers of it at the lower part of the neck is the platysma muscle, the fibres of which may be cleaned at once while removing the skin. Care must be taken as soon as the upper border of the platysma is reached to keep close to the skin, or the superficial nerves may be injured. The Platysma Myoides (Fig. 164, 6) is only seen now in its lower part, the remainder of it will be found in the dissection of the anterior triangle and face. It is a subcutaneous muscle arising from the fascia over the pectoral and deltoid muscles, and very slightly from the front of the clavicle ; it passes obliquely across the neck to be inserted into the lower border of the lower jaw near the symphysis and into the side of the mouth, the fibres of opposite sides interlacing below the symphysis, and the muscle if well developed reaching as high as the zygoma. It is supplied by the superficial cervical nerve. Through the platysma will generally be seen the External Jugular Vein (Fig. 164, 13), which, it is to be noticed, runs parallel or nearly so to the fibres of the muscle; if therefore, in bleeding from the jugular, an incision were made in the direction of the vein, there would be no opening by which the blood might escape, and hence the rule in practice, viz., to cut parallel to the sterno-mastoid, i.e., across the fibres of the platysma, so that they may retract. The Platysma is to be detached from the clavicle and turned forward, and the Superficial Branches of the Cervical Plexus are to be found. These are in two sets,—the ascending, comprising the Superficial Cervical, Great Auricular, and Small Occipital nerves, and the descending set comprising the Sternal, Clavicular, and Acromial branches. a. The Superficial Cervical Nerve (Fig. 164, 17) [from the second and third nerves] will be found turning round the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and crossing it transversely beneath the platysma to ramify over the anterior triangle, where it communicates with the infra-maxillary branches of the facial nerve. b. The Great Auricular Nerve (Fig. 164, 11) [from the second and third nerves] is the largest branch of the set, and turning round the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, passes obliquely to the pinna, and ends in three sets of branches, facial to the parotid gland and skin covering it, which communicate deeply with the facial nerve; auricular to the back of the pinna ; and mastoid to the skin over the mastoid process. This last is often of large size, and may be mistaken for the following : x 2308 POSTERIOR TRIANGLE OF NECK. c. The Small Occipital Nerve (Fig. 164, 3) [from the second nerve] is always to be found at the posterior margin of the stemo- mastoid muscle, and runs directly upwards to the scalp, where it has been already seen (p. 296). The Descending Branches (Fig. 164,21), sternal, clavicular, and acromial, [from the loop between the 3rd and 4th nerves], take the directions indicated by their names, and passing over the clavicle are distributed to the skin upon the pectoral muscle and shoulder, where they are seen by the dissector of the arm. [The anterior and posterior boundaries of the triangle (the sterno- mastoid and trapezius) are now to be defined, but only the edges of the muscles need be cleaned. The descending nerves being detached and turned up, the branches of the deep cervical plexus and the spinal-accessory nerve passing obliquely between the borders of the stemo-mastoid and the trapezius are to be dissected out, and also the omo-hyoid muscle, which will be found at a variable distance above the clavicle ; the external jugular vein is to be followed as far as- convenient.] The Deep Cervical Fascia, which is very dense, is now seen. It commences at the spinous processes of the vertebra; and encloses the trapezius muscle, then crosses the posterior triangle to split and enclose the stemo-mastoid, and so on to the median line of the neck. At the lower part of the triangle it gives a special covering to the omo-hyoid muscle, and is attached to the clavicle and first rib- It also gives sheaths to the deep muscles and vessels of the neck. [To see the floor of the triangle the fascia is to be removed, and will be most readily detached by beginning above at the junction of the stemo-mastoid and trapezius, and carrying the knife obliquel)r downwards and backwards so as to be parallel to the fibres of the muscles beneath. It should be removed only as low as the omo- hyoid at present, and all branches of nerve should be carefully preserved.] The Posterior Triangle (Fig. 164) is the space bounded in front by the sterno-mastoid, behind by the trapezius ; the base of the triangle being formed by the middle third of the clavicle, and its apex by the meeting of the anterior and posterior boundaries at the occiput. It is covered in by skin, superficial and deep fascise, and at the lower part by the platysma. Its floor is formed from above downwards by the splenius capitis, levator anguli scapula;, scalenus posticus and scalenus medius, and the upper digitation of the serratus magnus, which cannot be seen at present. The splenius colli does not form part of the floor, because it isPOSTERIOR TRIANGLE OF NECK. 309 Fig. 164. Fig. 164.—Superficial dissection of the triangles of the neck (drawn by J. T. Gray).

In some subjects, where the apex of the triangle is wider than usual, a portion of the complexus may be seen, and will be recognised by the vertical direction of its fibres. Not unfrequently, if the attachment of the sterno-mastoid to the clavicle is not well developed, both the anterior scalenus and the phrenic nerve lying on it are seen in the posterior triangle. The triangle is subdivided into two portions by the posterior belly of the omo-liyoid muscle, the height of which above the clavicle may vary, the contents of each subdivision being modified accordingly. The upper or occipital portion contains the branches of the super- ficial cervical plexus derived from the first four cervical nerves ; the spinal accessory nerve (which may be traced into the trapezius, where it communicates with branches of the 3rd and 4th cervical nerves); muscular branches of the cervical plexus; the transverse cervical vein ; and the (jlandulce concatenates or lymphatic glands placed along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid. The lower or clavicular portion contains the brachial plexus and its supraclavicular branches ; the third part of the subclavian artery ; the transverse cervical artery ; the suprascapular vessels ; and the external jugular vein, all of which must now be dissected. [The process of deep fascia binding down the tendon of the omo- hyoid is to be traced to its attachment below and then carefully removed. The external jugular vein and the transverse cervical and suprascapular arteries and veins are then to be carefully dissected and preserved, and the small nerve to the subclavius from the brachial plexus must also be found and preserved. A process of deep fascia connected with the scalenus anticus binds down the subclavian artery and must be removed to expose it.] The tendon of the Omo-hyoid Muscle (Fig. 164, 29) is bound down to the back of the clavicle and to the first rib by a process of the deep cervical fascia, so that either belly of the muscle may act on this fixed point. Upon the back of the tendon may be traced a branch of the descendens noni nerve, which supplies it. The origin and insertion of the muscle are found in other dissections. The Transverse Cervical Artery (Fig. 164, 25) is generally found at the level of the tendon of the omo-hyoid, and the vein a little above it, so that their relation to the subdivisions of the triangle is different. The artery, a branch of the thyroid axis [subclavian], passes trans- versely under the sterno-mastoid, crosses the posterior triangle, and divides under the border of the trapezius into the superficial cervical and the posterior scapular arteries. The superficial cervical goes toTHE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 311 the trapezius, the anterior border of which it supplies ; the posterior scapular runs under the levator anguli scapula? muscle to the base of the scapula, where it is seen in the dissection of the back. The transverse cervical vein lies above the level of the artery, and usually joins the external jugular. The Suprascapular Artery and Vein (Fig. 164, 31) lie close behind the clavicle. The artery is a branch of the thyroid axis, or sometimes arises from the third part of the subclavian. The vein opens into the external jugular, just before it joins the subclavian vein. The Subclavian Artery (Fig. 164, 30) (3rd portion) extends from the outer border of the anterior scalenus obliquely downwards and outwards be- neath the clavicle to the lower border of the first rib, where it becomes the axillary artery. It has in front the skin, pla- tysma, superficial nerves and deep fascia ; the clavicle, sub- clavius muscle, and supra- scapular vessels; and is crossed by the external jugular vein and the small nerve to the sub- clavius. It lies against the lowest cord of the brachial plexus, the scalenus medius, and the first rib. Above it are the remaining cords of the brachial plexus ; and beloiv (at some distance) the subcla- vian vein.

Surgery.—The position, relations and direction of the third portion of the subclavian should be especially noticed, because it is that on which a ligature is most frequently applied for aneurism lower down. The student should particularly accustom his finger to feel for the scalene tubercle on the first rib and the inner edge of the scalenus anticus muscle, which are taken as the guides to the artery ; and should notice how materially the position of the vessel is altered by raising or depressing the shoulder, the effect of an aneurism in the axilla being to raise the clavicle considerably, and thus complicate the opera- tion. The operation of tying the subclavian in its third part is thus performed. The head being thrown back and the shoulder de- pressed as much as pos- sible, the skin of the lower part of the triangle is to be drawn down upon the clavicle, and a lunated incision carried from the edge of the trapezius to the sterno-mastoid, cutting at once on to the bone. The skin being then allowed to resume its natural position, the incision will be immediately above the clavicle, and may be deep- ened at the anterior part. The external jugular vein is to be care- fully guarded, and held aside if necessary, and a cautious dissection made until the finger can feel the scalenus anticus and the tubercle on the first rib, to which it is attached. Immediately behind this the artery will be found, and even in the uninjected state will be readily recognised by its rolling on the bone beneath the finger. The aneurism needle should be passed from above, so as to avoid the brachial nerves, which are more liable to be included in the ligature than the vein, since this is quite below the artery. Fig. 166. Fig. 166.—Incisions for tying (e) the common carotid and (£) the subclavian artery (from Fergusson’s ‘ Practical Surgery ’).313 THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS. Fig. 167.—Diagram of the Brachial Plexus (drawn by J. T. Gray). [Supposing the dissection of the axilla to he sufficiently advanced, the clavicle should now be divided at the outer border of the sterno- inastoid and again at the edge of the trapezius. The knife being then passed carefully beneath and close to the bone to detach the sub- clavius, the piece may be removed, but the parts will still be retained in position by the muscle. The suprascapular artery and vein will now also be better seen, and can be thoroughly cleaned. The sub- clavius muscle is to be divided close to the trapezius, when the scapula will fall back, and the brachial plexus will be fully exposed and should be carefully cleaned. The upper digitation of the serratus magnus, which was mentioned as forming part of the floor of the triangle, can now be seen.] •The Brachial Plexus (Fig. 167) is formed by the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th cervical nerves and part of the 1st dorsal nerve, a small branch of communication being given by the lowest cord of the ■cervical plexus (4th). The nerves appear at the outer border of the Fig. 167. Nerve to rhomboids Supra-seapular nerve Nerve to subclavius Musculo-cutaneous nerve.

The 5th and 6th next unite, and are joined by the 7th at the outer border of the scalenus posticus, and thus two cords are formed. At the level of the clavicle each of these cords gives olf a large branch, and they unite to form a third cord ; the three nerves then come into relation with the axillary artery, being at first external, but afterwards internal, external, and posterior to that vessel. More frequently the three trunks formed by the junction of the five nerves subdivide and reunite to form three cords, as follows, without the production of two cords only at any one point : —315 THE ORBIT. (Fig. 168). Each divides, into an anterior and a posterior branch; the anterior branches of the upper and middle trunks form the outer cord, the anterior branch of the lowest forms the inner cord, and the three posterior branches unite to form the posterior cord (Lucas). The branches above the clavicle (Fig. 4, p. 18)—■ a. The nerve to the subclavius is a small branch lying on the front of the plexus, and derived from the trunk formed by the 5th and 6tli nerves above the suprascapular nerve. b. The nerve to the rhomboids is from the 5th nerve, and piercing the scalenus medius passes beneath the levator anguli scapuhe, to which it gives a branch, to reach the under surface of the rhomboids, in which it ends. c. The Supra-scapular nerve is the largest branch above the clavicle, and appears at the outer side of the plexus, being given off from the upper cord of the plexus (5th and 6th). It disappears beneath the trapezius to reach the supra-scapular notch. d. The nerve to the serratus magnus (posterior thoracic, external respiratory of Bell) lies behind the plexus against the serratus magnus muscle, and is derived from the 5th and 6th (and often from the 7th) nerves before they unite. e. A branch to the phrenic nerve of very variable size is given by the 5th nerve at the upper part, or sometimes the branch appears to pass from the phrenic to the 5th. A root to the phrenic is sometimes, supplied by the nerve to the subclavius. /. Small branches to the longus colli and scaleni muscles arise from the nerves close to the foramina. [If the time for turning the subject has not arrived when both the posterior triangles of the neck are dissected, the orbits should be at once proceeded with; but if not now dissected they had better be postponed until after the dissection of the anterior triangle.] The Okbit. [The head being raised to a convenient height, the saw is to be applied to the edge of the skull close to the inner and outer angles of the orbit (the proper points being readily ascertained with the finger), and the cuts carried into the orbit through the frontal bone. With the chisel these incisions are to be prolonged back- wards till they meet at the sphenoidal fissure, when the triangle of bone can be readily tilted forward by a blow with the hammer. Any small remnant of bone can be removed so as to expose fully the cavity, but the margin of the optic foramen should be left untouched.]THE ORBIT. 316 The first thing seen on opening the orbit is the Periosteum, which is detached from the triangle of bone, and will be seen to be continuous with the dura mater of the skull through the sphenoidal fissure and the optic foramen. At the margin of the orbit the periosteum splits into two layers ; one, which is continuous around the margin with the external periosteum of the skull, and the other, which forms the palpebral ligament of each eyelid. The periosteum being divided in the centre and carefully turned ■ aside, and some soft fat removed, three nerves and two arteries are brought into view—the frontal nerve [5th] with the supra-orhital artery in the centre, the lachrymal nerve and artery on the outer side, and the little fourth nerve on the inner side; the lachrymal gland is also seen. The Fourth Nerve (Fig. 169, 13) (trochlearis or patheticus) has Fjg. 169. Fig. 169.—Superficial dissection of the nerves of the orbit (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Supra-trochlear nerve. 2.

The Frontal Nerve (Fig. 169, 8) [5th], the largest nerve entering through the sphenoidal fissure, lies in the centre of the orbit and divides at its anterior part into the supra-orbital and supra-trochlear branches ; these turn round the margin of the orbit to the forehead, the supra-orbital through the supra-orbital notch, and the supra- trochlear close to the inner angle of the orbit. Frequently the supra- trochlear nerve, the more internal of the two, is double. The Lachrymal Nerve (Fig. 169, 12) [5th] lies on the outer side of the orbit and passes to the lachrymal gland, which it sup- plies. It frequently sends a branch to the forehead close to the outer angle of the orbit, which forms a junction with the temporo-malar nerve. The Supra-Orbital Artery (Fig. 170, 8) is a branch of the ophthalmic artery, and accom- panies the supra-orbital nerve to the forehead. The Lachrymal Artery (Fig. 170, 12) is a smaller branch also from the ophthalmic, and supplies the lachrymal gland. The Lachrymal Gland (Fig. 170, 4) is an almond-shaped body Fig. 170.—Arteries and veins of orbit (from Hirschfeld and Reveille). 1. Pulley of superior oblique tendon. 2. Levator palpebras (cut). 3.

It is convex on its superior aspect, to fit against the orbital plate of the frontal bone ; concave beneath, where it is placed over the eye-ball. It secretes the tears, which its ducts, seven or eight in number, carry to the surface of the conjunctiva beneath the upper eyelid. [The frontal nerve is to be divided, and a hook inserted into the upper eyelid so as to put the levator palpebrae in the centre of the orbit on the stretch ; this muscle and the superior oblique are then to be cleaned, care being taken not to destroy the little pulley through which the tendon of the latter works.] The Obliquus Superior (Fig. 169, 3) is the most superficial muscle of the orbit at its origin, which is from the upper margin of the optic foramen, above and a little to the inner side of the levator palpebrae. It lies superficially along the inner side of the orbit, and ends in a round tendon which, passing through the trochlea or pulley- like ring of fibrous tissue attached to the frontal bone, turns down abruptly to the eye-ball. The tendon becomes flattened near its in- sertion, and passes beneath the superior rectus to be inserted on the outer side of the eye-ball, between the superior and the external rectus. With a little dissection a delicate synovial membrane can be seen, lubricating the tendon where it passes through the trochlea. The superior oblique is supplied by the 4th nerve on its orbital aspect. The Levator Palpebrae Superioris (Fig. 169, 6) arises from the upper margin of the optic foramen, below the superior oblique muscle and partly overlapped by it; it is narrow at its origin, but expands in front to be inserted into the anterior surface of the tarsal cartilage of the upper eyelid. It is supplied by the 3rd nerve. [The hook is to be removed from the eyelid and fixed into the eye-ball, which is to be drawn gently forwards; the levator palpebrae is to be cut, and the little branch of the 3rd nerve traced to it, and the superior rectus, which is then seen, should be cleaned.] The Rectus Superior (Fig. 170, 6) arises from the margin of the optic foramen, below and a little overlapped by the levator palpebrae; and is inserted into the sclerotic coat of the eye-ball at its upper and anterior part. It is supplied by the upper division of the 3rd nerve, which can be seen entering its under surface when the muscle is divided.319 NERVES OF THE ORBIT. [The rectus having been divided, a quantity of fat will he brought into view, through which the optic nerve passes to the eye-ball. The nasal branch of the 5th is at once to be looked for crossing the optic nerve from without inwards, and the lenticular ganglion, a minute pink body, is to be found on the outer side of the optic nerve. All small branches of nerve running from the ganglion along the optic nerve are to be preserved, and all branches of the ophthalmic artery.] Fig. 171.

It thus re-enters the cranium, and next passes into the nose by a slit in front of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, to appear ultimately on the face, between the nasal bone and the lateral nasal cartilage. It gives off, l,the long root to the lenticular ganglion on the outer side of the optic nerve ; 2, the long ciliary nerves, which run along the optic nerve to the eye-ball; 3, the infra-trochlear nerve, which, arising just before the nerve enters the ethmoidal hole, passes forwards to the eyelid close to the inner angle of the orbit. The Lenticular Ganglion (Fig. 172) (ciliary or ophthalmic) is a minute pink body placed on the outer side of the optic nerve near the back of the orbit, which has (like all the cranial ganglia) three roots, sensory, motor, and sympathetic. The sensory or long root(2) is derived from the nasal branch of the 5th, and enters the posterior super- ior angle of the ganglion. The motor or short root (4) is derived from the branch of the 3rd nerve supplying the inferior oblique, which can be seen passing to the bottom of the orbit; this root enters the ganglion at its posterior inferior angle. The sympathetic root (6) is from the cavernous plexus, which is derived from the plexus on the carotid artery, and enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure; it joins the ganglion between the other two roots, and can rarely be seen. The short ciliary Iranches of the ganglion arise from its upper and lower angles in front, and are eight or ten in number. They run along the optic nerve to the eye-ball, which they pierce to supply the his. The Ophthalmic Artery (Fig. 173, 2) arises from the internal carotid close to the anterior clinoid process, and enters the orbit through the optic foramen with the optic nerve, but to its outer side. It gives off the following branches :— a. The Lachrymal artery (5) accompanies the lachrymal nerve Fig. 172. Fig. 172.—Diagram of the lenticular ganglion (from Hirschfeld and Reveille). 1.

Muscular branches (4) are given to all the muscles of the orbit, entering them on their ocirlar surfaces. • Fig. 173. n d. The Ciliary branches (6) are numerous small arteries which run by the side of the optic nerve to pierce the sclerotic, and have been divided into anterior and posterior. One of them pierces the optic nerve to run in it to the retina, and is called the arteria centralis retince (3). e. The Ethmoidal arteries, anterior (9) and posterior (7), pass through the ethmoidal foramina in the inner wall of the orbit, the anterior accompanying the nasal nerve. They supply meningeal twigs and branches to the nose, the anterior ending on the face. /. The Palpebral arteries (14) leave the orbit at the inner side, to be distributed to the upper and lower eyelids. Fig. 173.—Arteries of the orbit from the outer side (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

The Frontal artery (13), one of the terminal branches, turns round the margin of the orbit at its inner angle to accompany the supra-trochlear nerve on the forehead. h. The Nasal artery (15), the other terminal branch, leaves the orbit at the inner side above the tendo oculi, and anastomoses on the side of the nose with the angular branch of the facial artery (12). The Ophthalmic Vein (Fig. 170, 10) has branches corresponding to those of the artery, which unite to form a single trunk passing between the heads of the external rectus to the cavernous sinus. The Optic Nerve (Fig. 170, 13) (2nd) enters the orbit by the optic foramen, and passes through its centre to the eye-ball, to end in the retina. It pierces the back of the sclerotic about its own width to the inner side of the axis of the eye-ball. [The optic nerve is to be divided, and the globe turned forwards to bring into view the muscles beneath.] The remaining Recti Muscles (Fig. 174) are seen below, and to the inner and outer sides of, the optic nerve, and are named accord- ingly, inferior, interims, and externus. They arise by a common origin (ligament of Zinn) around the optic foramen, but the externus has an attachment to the lower margin of the sphenoidal fissure, completing its lower head, as well as a second head (the upper) arising from the upper part of the optic foramen,, where it is united to that of the rectus superior. Between these two heads pass the 3rd nerve, the nasal branch of the 5th nerve, the 6th nerve, and the ophthalmic vein. The recti muscles are to be traced forward to their insertion into the sclerotic coat, a quarter of an inch behind the cornea. The Sixth Nerve (Fig. 171, 8) (abducens) is seen on the inner surface of the rectus externus, which it supplies. The Third Nerve (Fig. 171, 13) (motor oculi) enters the orbit in two parts, one above and the other below the nasal nerve. The upper division has been traced to the levator palpebrte and superior rectus muscles ; the lower division (14) is now seen to give small branches to the internal and inferior recti, and the long branch which runs on the inferior rectus to the inferior oblique muscle, from which the short root to the lenticular ganglion is derived. [To expose the obliquus inferior, it will be necessary to draw the eye-ball to the upper and outer part of the orbit, and to remove the conjunctiva at the inner angle.]323 THE OBLIQUUS INFERIOR. The Obliquus Inferior (Fig. 174, 9) muscle lies transversely in the orbit beneath the rectus inferior. It arises from the superior Fie. 174. maxilla behind the lachrymal groove, and passing below the inferior rectus, but between the external rectus and globe, is inserted into the sclerotic above the level of the rectus extemus and close to the in- sertion of the obliquus super- ior. The actions of the muscles of the orbit are not very readily appreciated, owing to the fact that the movements of the eyeball depend upon the com- bined influence of several of them. The action of the Levator palpebrse is implied by its name; it raises the eyelid, and therefore when paralysed from some affection of the third nerve, the characteristic dropping of the lid, ptosis, results. The Recti muscles, when acting together, would draw the eye-ball towards the back of the orbit, but each, when acting separably would draw the front of the eye in its own direction ; the superior and inferior recti having in addition a tendency to draw the eye inwards. Internal and external strabismus are produced by the direct action of the internal and external recti respectively. The Oblique muscles when acting alone are rotators of the eye-ball on its own4xis;‘the superior oblique rolling the eye downwards and outwards, the iirfirior oblique rolling it upwards and outwards ; but these musifes aWtiys act in combination with the recti, and thus give the oblique moveinents to the eye-ball. The obliqui are not used unless the spectator, or the object seen, is moving. If all the contents of the orbit are removed, the orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve • (temporo-malar) may be seen passing through the splieno-maxillaryifissure, and dividing into two branches ■/ 1 r.- C 1 ■ & Fig. 174.—Muscles of the eye-ball.

T 2SIDE OF THE NECK. 324 —the subcutaneus mnlce, which pierces the malar hone, and the temporal branch, which pierces the outer wall of the orbit to get between the two layers of the temporal fascia (p. 294). The Side of the Neck. [The head is to be drawn as far back as possible by means of a hook placed in the chin, and the side to be dissected (by preference the right side first) should be fully exposed by means of blocks placed beneath. Before beginning the dissection the student should pass his finger along the median line of the neck, and recognise the following points. The lower jaw, and from an inch and a half to two inches below it, the slight projection of the hyoid bone ; next a hollow, corresponding to the thyro-liyoid membrane, and below it the projecting angle of the thyroid cartilage (pomum Adaini), which is very small in women. About an inch below the pomum Adami is a dip corresponding to the crico-thyroid space, and this is especially to be noticed, as it is the space in which laryngotomy is performed. Below this will be felt the hard ring of the cricoid cartilage, and in a thin subject the rings of the trachea may be recognised lower down; sometimes also the isthmus of the thyroid body may be felt crossing the trachea at a variable point. An incision is to be made from the chin to the sternum, and the flap of skin is to be dissected up over the face. The platysma may be cleaned in the upper part of the space at once, and it will facilitate the operation if the part detached from the clavicle is held down with hooks.] The Platysma Myoides (Fig. 164, 6) is now seen to reach to the side of the lower jaw, where it is partially inserted. The muscle decussates in the median line with its fellow of the opposite side for a short distance close to the jaw, but at the lower part of the neck a large triangular interval exists between them. A few small branches of the superficial cervical nerve will be found piercing the muscle, and an anterior jugular vein may sometimes be seen through its fibres. [The platysma is to be carefully reflected like the skin, the super- ficial nerves are to be dissected out, and the sterno-mastoid cleaned by removing that part of the deep cervical fascia which forms the super- ficial layer of its sheath.] The Superficial Cervical Nerve (Fig. 164, 17), which is of small size, is seen to divide into two or three branches which supply the skin over the anterior triangle, the upper one communicating with branches of the facial nerve below the jaw. The Sterno-Cleido-Mastoid Muscle (Fig. 164, 28) arises by an325 THE ANTERIOR TRIANGLE. oval tendon from tlie top of the sternum, and by a broad tendinous origin from the inner third of the posterior border of the clavicle. This latter is of very variable extent, and between the two heads of origin is a cellular interval, which may extend for some distance up the neclc. The muscle is inserted across the mastoid process of the temporal hone, and into the outer half of the superior curved line of the occipital hone. The action of each sterno-mastoid is to twist the head and flex it, so as to throw the chin over the opposite shoulder ; if both muscles act together they draw the head and upper part of the spine forwards, as in rising from a pillow. The sterno-mastoid is supplied by the spinal-accessory nerve and by deep branches of the cervical plexus. Along the posterior border of and beneath the sterno-mastoid will he seen several small lymphatic glands (glandules concatenates). The Deep Cervical Fascia, which has been traced from the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae across the posterior triangle (p. 308), is now seen to cover in the parts included in the anterior triangle, and to extend to the median line ; the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid should he dissected up a little, and turned hack to see the continuation of the fascia beneath it. The fascia gives sheaths to all the muscles of the front of the neck, and is continued into the thorax, where it is attached to the pericardium. It forms the sheath of the carotid artery, which is now to he seen beneath the sterno- mastoid. [Opportunity should he taken, before the tissues are in any way disturbed, to notice the parts involved in the operation of tying the common carotid artery. The vessel may be felt and indistinctly seen enclosed in a sheath of fascia, and the point where the ligature would be applied is at the angle formed by the sterno-mastoid and omo- hyoid. muscles, the latter of which can now be seen through the fascia. The anterior triangle is then to be dissected.] The Anterior Triangle (Fig. 164) of the neck is bounded in front by the median line of the neck ; and behind by the sterno-mas- toid muscle. Its base is above, and is formed by the lower jaw and a line from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process ; the apex is below, at the top of the sternum. The skin and superficial fascia, the platysma, the deep fascia, and the superficial nerves have been turned aside to expose the contents of the triangle, which are as follows. The digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles are seen to cut off the submaxillary triangle, in which is lodged the submaxillary gland, resting upon the mylo-hyoid muscle between the jaw and the hyoid bone. Below the hyoid bone will be326 SIDE OF THE NECK. seen the sterno-hvoicl, the sternothyroid, and thyro-hyoid mnscles ; and the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid which runs obliquely across the triangle, dividing it into an upper and lower part. The common carotid artery comes into view between the sterno- mastoid and omo-hyoid muscles, with the descendens noni nerve superficial to it, and the internal jugular vein to its outer side and concealing the pneumo-gastric nerve. The external and internal carotids are seen at, or near, the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and are crossed superficially by the hypoglossal nerve; both cross the superior laryngeal nerve, which is seen passing to the larynx be- tween the middle and inferior constrictors of the pharynx, to the inner side of the carotid vessels. The superior thyroid, lingual, and facial arteries are seen in part in the anterior portion of the space ; and the occipital artery is seen turning backwards below the digastric, and in relation with the hypoglossal nerve. [It will be advisable to examine the ligaments of the inner end of the clavicle, before detaching it in order to reflect the stemo-mastoid muscle. The sternal origin of the sterno-mastoid must be cut, and any remains of the pectoralis major be removed, in order that the ligaments between the clavicle, sternum, and first rib, and also between the two clavicles, may be cleaned.] Sterno-Clavicular Articulation (Fig. 175). The Inter-clavicular ligament (2) is a strong band passing across the inter-clavicular notch of the sternum, and attached to that bone as well as to the inner extremi- ties of the two clavicles. The Sterno-clavicular liga- ment (1) may be considered to form a capsule to the joint, or may be divided into an- terior and posterior ligaments. The fibres pass obliquely from the inner extremity of the cla- vicle to the margin of the arti- cular surface of the sternum. Fig. 175.

The Costo-clavicular or Rhomboid ligament (3) is a strong band of fibres of a rhomboidal shape, attached to the upper surface of the cartilage of the first rib, and to the rough impression on the under surface of the inner end of the clavicle, close to the articulation. [It is supposed that the clavicle has been cut close to the attach- ment of the sterno-mastoid in the dissection of the posterior triangle of the neck, but if this has not been the case it should now be divided. The inner end of the clavicle being then drawn up, the costo-clavicular ligament is to be divided, and the knife passed into the sterno-clavicular articulation from below and close to the clavicle. By this, one of the synovial membranes will be opened, and the other can be exposed by cutting from above close to the sternum, thus leaving the inter-articular cartilage uninjured.] The Inter-articular fibro-cartilage (4) is circular and flat, and is thinner in the centre than at the circumference, being occasionally perforated. It is attached to the clavicle above, and to the sternum and cartilage of the first rib below, and by its circumference to the ligaments of the articulation. A synovial membrane is placed on each side of it. The sterno-clavicular is an arthrodial joint admitting of extensive movements of the clavicle in all directions. [The inter-articular fibro-cartilage is to be divided and the inner end of the clavicle dislocated, the fibres of the sterno-hyoid which are attached to it being separated. The sterno-mastoid (with the portion of the clavicle) is then to be turned back, being carefully separated from the fascia beneath. The spinal-accessory nerve will be found to pierce it at the upper part, and some branches of the cervical plexus enter the under surface of the muscle.] Parts beneath, the Sterno-Mastoid Muscle. By the removal of the sterno-mastoid the following structures will be brought into view, which must be subsequently studied in detail. The posterior belly of the digastric and the stylo-liyoid, with the posterior auricular artery and parotid gland at the upper border, and the occipital artery at the lower border of the digastric. Lower down are parts of the splenius capitis, levator anguli scapulae, and scalenus medius, with the cervical nerves and lymphatic glands. In front, immediately below the digastric, the spinal-accessory nerve will be found, and the hypoglossal nerve arching forward over the carotid vessels. The common carotid, with the internal jugular vein external to it, and the pneumo-gastric nerve lying deeply between the two, will be found in a sheath of fascia above the border of the omo-hyoid, and the descendens noni nerve lies either upon or in the sheath, and328 SIDE OF THE NECK. forms one or more loops with the communicating branches from the cervical plexus. The bifurcation of the carotid will be seen about the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, the internal carotid passing upwards by the side of the jugular vein, with the external carotid in front of it, the anterior branches of the latter reaching forward beyond the sterno-mastoid. Near the clavicle are the omo- hyoid, stemo-hyoid and sterno-tliyroid muscles, and, deeper, the anterior scalenus with the phrenic nerve upon it. On the left side of the body the small thoracic duct will be found arching across the phrenic nerve and anterior scalenus to open into the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian veins. A similar but smaller duct (right lymphatic) may be found on the right side. The small Descendens Noni Nerve (Fig. 177, 14) is now to be dissected out. It is either upon or M'ithin the sheath of the carotid vessels, and is to be traced upwards to the 9th nerve (winch crosses the carotid sheath just below the digastric muscle), and downwards to the muscles in the front of the neck which it supplies, viz., sterno- hyoid, sterno-tliyroid, and omo-hyoid. A branch, which may be double, will be found to come forward from the cervical plexus to join the nerve and form a loop beneath the sterno-mastoid. This is the communicans noni nerve (7), and comes from the 2nd and 3rd cervical nerves. The Anterior Jugular Vein will be found of very variable size, and near the median line of the neck. It pierces the deep fascia, and passes outwards beneath the sterno-mastoid to open into the sub- clavian or external jugular vein. Its size depends upon that of the external jugular, varying inversely with it. Just above the sternum, the two anterior jugular veins are joined by a transverse branch, which, with a little fat, occupies an interval between two layers of the deep cervical fascia which are attached to the upper border of the sternum. [The fascia is now to be removed from the superficial muscles of the triangle, but the carotid sheath should be left untouched for the present.] The Sterno-hyoid (Fig. 176, 14) is the most superficial muscle ; it is" next to the median line, and only separated by a small cellular interval from its fellow of the opposite side. It arises from the back of the first piece of the sternum, from the first costal cartilage, and from the back of the inner extremity of the clavicle ; and is inserted into the body of the hyoid bone. The Sterno-tliyroid (Fig. 176, 15) is deeper and broader than the preceding muscle, by which it is partly covered. It arises from the329 THE THYRO-HYOID. back of tlie sternum immediately below the sterno-hyoid, and from the first costal cartilage ; and is inserted into the oblique line on the side of the thyroid cartilage. It very generally has a transverse tendinous intersection in its fibres. The Thyro-hyoid (Fig. 176, 16) is a direct continuation of the Fig. 176. last muscle. It arises from the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage, and is inserted into the body and part of the great cornu of the hyoid Fig. 176.—Muscles of the anterior aspect of the neck ; on the left side of the figure the superficial muscles are seen, on the right the deep (from Wilson). 1.

A small special branch of nerve from the 9th should be traced to this muscle. The Omo-hyoid (Fig. 176, 17) can now be seen in its whole length, crossing the neck beneath the stemo-mastoid, and consisting of two bellies united by a small tendon, which has been seen to be held down to the clavicle and first rib by a process of the deep cer- vical fascia (v. p. 310). It arises from the upper margin of the scapula close to the notch, and from the transverse ligament which converts the supra-scapular notch into a hole. It is inserted into the body of the hyoid bone external to the sterno-liyoid, and superficial to the tliyro-hyoid muscle. These four muscles are direct or indirect depressors of the hyoid bone. They are all supplied by the descendens noni nerve, except the thyro-liyoid, which receives a special branch from the 9th nerve. The Digastric (Fig. 176, 1) muscle consists of two portions, placed in front of and behind the submaxillary gland above the hyoid bone, to which the intermediate tendon is attached. It arises from the groove on the inner side of the mastoid process of the tem- poral bone ; and is inserted into the digastric fossa at the lower border of the inferior maxilla close to the median line. Its action is to open the mouth, or if the jaw is fixed, to raise the hyoid bone and larynx. Its posterior belly is supplied by a branch of the facial nerve, and the anterior by the mylo-kyoid branch of the inferior dental nerve (5th). The Stylo-hyoid (Fig. 176,4) is the muscle in immediate connec- tion with the posterior belly of the digastric, the tendon of which passes through the fibres of the stylo-hyoid close to the hyoid bone. It arises from the outer or posterior part of the styloid process of the temporal bone between the stylo-pharyngeus and stylo-glossus muscles ; and is inserted into the upper surface of the body of the hyoid bone. It is supplied by a branch of the facial nerve. [The sheath of the carotid artery derived from the cervical fascia is now to be opened. The descendens noni nerve has already been traced upon it, and within will now be found the common carotid artery nearest the median line ; external to that the pneumo-gastric (or vagus) nerve, and still more externally the internal jugular vein. Behind the sheath will be found the trunk of the sympathetic nerve lying parallel with the vessels, and crossing transversely behind them at the lower part will be seen the inferior thyroid artery. The sheath is to be carefully dissected away, and the branches of the artery and vein followed out and cleaned as far as the dissection will admit of. The large 9th nerve will be found crossing the external and internal carotids in a curved direction immediately below the di-THE COMMON CAROTID ARTERY. 331 gastric muscle, and the superior laryngeal branch of the pneumo- gastric crosses behind them a little lower down.] The Common Carotid Artery (Fig. 177, 14) has the same re- lations on both sides of the neck from the sterno-clavicular articula- tion upwards, though its origin is different on the two sides. On the right side it commences at the stemo-clavicular articulation, by the bifurcation of the innominate into common carotid and subclavian arteries, but on the left side it begins at the arch of the aorta. Its direction in the neck is upwards and a little outwards, and would be sufficiently indicated by a line from the end of the clavicle to the external auditory meatus. It ordinarily divides at the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage into external and internal carotids, which lie at first side by side, the external being nearer the median line. It has in front of it the sternal origin and anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and the lower parts of the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles ; it is crossed by the omo-hyoid muscle and superior thyroid vein, and quite superficially by the platysma ; close upon the vessel throughout are the descendens noni nerve and the sheath, and cross- ing the sheath at the lower part is the middle thyroid vein, and at a variable point the sterno-mastoid artery. Behind the artery are the sheath, the sympathetic cord, and its middle cervical ganglion ; the inferior thyroid artery, and the longus colli and rectus capitis anticus major muscles. To its outer side are the pneumo-gastric nerve and the internal jugular vein ; and to the inner side the trachea, larynx, and thyroid body; the pharynx, oesophagus, and recurrent laryngeal nerve. The point of bifurcation of the common carotid may vary a little, but is more frequently above than below the thyroid cartilage. Surgery.—To tie the common carotid artery (Fig. 166, e). This may be accomplished either above or below the omo-hyoid, but above the muscle is the better situation. An incision three inches in length along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, beginning at the level of the hyoid bone, will allow that muscle to be turned out- wards sufficiently to bring the omo-hyoid into view. In the angle between the two muscles the carotid is to be found, and this part of the operation will be much facilitated by slightly reflecting the omo- hyoid towards the median line (Fig. 164). The descendens noni nerve may be seen on the sheath of the vessels, and is to be avoided, and the sheath is to be carefully opened on its inner side so as to avoid possible injury to the internal jugularSIDE OF THE NECK. 332 vein. The needle is to he passed from the outer side, care being taken not to include the pneumo-gastric nerve or the sympathetic. On the dead body the vein is frequently empty, and is liable to be injured unless the sheath be opened well to its inner side. The operation below the omo-liyoid might be performed through a similar incision along the border of the lower part of the stemo- mastoid, but would be facilitated by dividing the sternal origin of the muscle. The sterno-lryoid and thyroid muscles would require to be turned inwards, or even divided, in order to reach the vessel. The Internal Carotid Artery (Fig. 180, 2) ascends to the base of the skull, lying close to the pharynx and upon the prevertebral muscles, the vagus, and the sympathetic cord. It is first to the outer side of the external carotid and at the same level, and is crossed by the 9th nerve with the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, and the posterior auricular and occipital arteries ; but it crosses the superior laryngeal branch of the pneumo-gastric. Its course is then deeper than the external carotid, from which it is separated by the styloid process with the stylo-pharyngeus muscle and glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and the pharyngeal branch of the vagus, until it finally enters the carotid canal in the petrous bone. The internal carotid will be more fully traced out in the deep dissection of the neck and pharynx. The External Carotid Artery (Fig. 177) is derived from the common carotid opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and, lying to the inner side of the internal carotid, ascends beneath the sterno-mastoid to a point between the ear and the jaw, where it gives off its terminal branches. It is crossed by two muscles and a nerve (the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles and the 9th nerve), and is separated by the styloid process with the stylo-pharyngeus muscle and glosso-pharyngeal nerve from the internal carotid at the upper part, where that vessel lies deeper than it. It is crossed by the lingual and facial veins, and enters the substance of the parotid gland behind the angle of the jaw, where it lies beneath the facial nerve and the commencement of the external jugular vein. Its branches may be divided into three sets, each containing three branches. Anterior set: 1, Superior Thyroid ; 2, Lingual; 3, Facial. Posterior set: 1, Occipital; 2, Posterior Auricular; 3, Sterno- Mastoid .* * Tlie stemo-mastokl is perhaps more frequently derived from one of the branches of the external carotid (superior thyroid or occipital) than from the trunk itself, but is inserted here to complete the three branches of the posterior set.333 BRANCHES OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID.

It gives off a hyoid branch, which runs along the lower border of the hyoid bone, and anastomoses with the hyoid branch of the lingual artery upon the upper border ; the superior laryngeal branch, which pierces the thyro-lryoid membrane with the corresponding nerve ; and the crico- thyroid branch, which anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side across the crico-tliyroid membrane. Also, a superficial descending branch, which supplies the depressor muscles of the hyoid bone, and from which the sterno-mastoid artery is frequently derived. The crico-tliyroid branch is considered to be one of the dangers seen in laryngotomy, but the fact of its being parallel to the knife when entered transversely, as it ordinarily is in the operation, renders its division unlikely, whilst its small size would cause such an accident to be of slight importance. The Lingual Artery (Fig. 177, 8).—Only a very small portion of the lingual artery is now visible, running transversely upon the middle constrictor of the pharynx immediately above the hyoid bone, and disappearing beneath the edge of the hyoglossus muscle, being usually crossed by the digastric and stylo-liyoid muscles and the hypoglossal nerve. The remainder of the vessel will be given in the dissection of the submaxillary region. The Facial Artery (Fig. 177, 4) passes upwards and forwards beneath the digastric and stylo-liyoid muscles, and forms a remark- able sigmoid curve as it lies in a deep groove on the posterior part of the submaxillary gland before reaching the jaw, which it crosses immediately in front of the masseter muscle ; it will be followed out in the dissection of the face. Its inferior palatine branch may be seen disappearing between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pliaryngeus muscles, and the tonsillar branch between the stylo-glossus and pterygoideus internus, and these will be afterwards dissected. Its submaxillary branches (two or three) enter the gland ; and the submental branch, often of large size, runs forward over the mylo-hyoid muscle to the cliin, where it supplies the surrounding tissues. The facial frequently arises in common with -the lingual artery, in which case the vessel passes beneath the hypoglossal nerve. The Occipital Artery (Fig. 177, 1) is seen only in its first part. It runs backwards along the inferior border of the digastric, and335 THE INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN. may usually be recognised by the fact that the 9th nerve (hypo- glossal) hooks round it. The occipital artery crosses the following important structures, the hypoglossal nerve, internal carotid artery, pneumo-gastric nerve, internal jugular vein, spinal-accessory nerve, and sympathetic trunk. It gives a small posterior meningeal branch to enter the jugular foramen. The Posterior Auricular Artery runs along the upper border of the digastric, and can only be seen by turning that muscle a little down. At the mastoid process it gives the stylo-mastoid branch to the stylo-mastoid foramen, and then supplies the pinna. The Sterno-Mastoid Artery is a small branch of uncertain origin, coming either from the external carotid artery near its commencement, or from the occipital or superior thyroid arteries, or both the latter. It is of small size and enters the under surface of the sterno-mastoid muscle, crossing the carotid sheath. Veins corresponding to the branches of the external carotid artery take nearly the same courses as those vessels, and terminate as follows : The internal maxillary and temporal veins unite in the parotid to form the teinporo-maxillary vein, which afterwards receives the posterior auricular vein. At the angle of the jaw this divides into the External Jugular and the facial communi- cating. The latter joins the facial vein to form the common facial, which enters the Internal Jugular. All the other veins open into the Internal Jugular Vein directly, or into an Anterior Jugular if one exists. The Internal Jugular Vein (Fig. 177, 5) is deeply placed to the outer side of the internal carotid artery immediately below the base of the skull, being crossed by the styloid process and stylo- pharyngeus muscle, and the spinal accessory nerve, which, however, is sometimes beneath the vein. Having been crossed by the digastric and stylo-liyoid and the occipital artery, it is covered by the sterno- mastoid for the rest of its course. It lies to the outer side of the internal and common carotid arteries, having the pneumo-gastric nerve between it and them, and is enclosed in the carotid sheath of cervical fascia. The internal jugular vein receives the facial, lingual, occipital, pharyngeal, superior and middle thyroid veins, and unites with the subclavian vein to form the vena innominata. In the angle formed by the junction of the two veins, on the left side of the body, and taking a slightly curved course on the surface of the anterior scalene muscle, will be found the termination of the Thoracic Duct. This tube should be carefully preserved, and will be subsequently more fully dissected. A corresponding but much336 SIDE OF THE NECK. smaller duct (right lymphatic duct) may be found on the right side of the body. [The inner end of the clavicle having been removed with the sterno-mastoid, a little dissection close above the sternum will readily expose the scalenus anticus muscle attached to the first rib, and having the phrenic nerve lying upon it and branches of the thyroid axis crossing it. The pneumo-gastric if traced down will be found to cross the first part of the subclavian artery, which with its branches is to be defined. The sympathetic and the thoracic duct on the left side are to be carefully preserved.] The Subclavian Arteries differ on the two sides, the right beginning at the sterno-clavicular articulation, and the left at the arch of the aorta, and having therefore a course in the thorax. Both arteries may be divided into three parts, of which the second and third correspond precisely on the two sides of the body, and the cervical portion of the first part of the left nearly with the first part on the right side. The first •part on the right side extends from the bifurcation of the innominate artery at the stemo-clavicular articulation to the inner border of the scalenus anticus. Its course is obliquely upwards and outwards, and it has in front of it the inner end of the clavicle with the sterno-mastoid, sterno-liyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles ; being crossed by the pneiuno-gastric, cardiac, and phrenic nerves, and the internal jugular and vertebral veins. It lies against the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the apex of the pleura, which intervenes between it and the neck of the first rib and also invests its lower border. The innominate vein is in front of, but quite below the level of, this part of the artery. The first part on the left side extends from the arch of the aorta to the inner border of the scalenus anticus, and may be conveniently subdivided into a thoracic and a cervical portion. The cervical por- tion is curved or nearly horizontal, and has in front of it the sterno- mastoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles, and the inner end of the clavicle ; being crossed by the internal jugular and vertebral veins, and by the phrenic nerve close to the scalenus. It lies against the apex of the pleura, which intervenes between it and the neck of the first rib, and also closely invests the artery below. The Branches of the first part of the subclavian artery are (1) Vertebral, (2) Internal Mammary, and (3) Thyroid Axis, and their distribution is the same on both sides of the body. The Superior Intercostal artery arises to the inner border of the scalenus on the337 THE INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY. left side, and may be considered to be a branch of the first part of the subclavian. 1. The Vertebral Artery (Fig. 178, 5) is seen now in only a small part of its course. It ascends between the scalenus anticus and longus colli muscles, being crossed by the inferior thyroid artery and, on the left side, by the thoracic duct ; and enters the foramen in the transverse process of the 6th cervical vertebra (usually), being accompanied by a branch from the inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. The artery passes through the transverse processes of all the upper cervical vertebrae, giving off muscular and spinal branches in its course, and is seen, in the suboccipital region, to wind inwards upon the atlas and enter the foramen magnum, to “£• supply the brain. The Vertebral vein has no course in the skull, but commences in small branches about the atlas. It takes the same course as the artery, receiving corresponding branches and also the ascending cervical and deep cervical veins, and after cross- ing the subclavian artery, opens into the termination of the subclavian vein. It often passes through the foramen in the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. 2. The Internal Mammary Artery (Fig. 178, 4) arises from the lower surface of the subclavian artery, and at once descends into the thorax, being crossed superficially and obliquely by the phrenic nerve. The left artery has been seen to pass through the anterior mediastinum, but the right is excluded by the pleura, which binds it to the costal cartilages. Both arteries pass between the triangularis sterni muscle and the costal cartilages, and divide opposite the seventh costal cartilage into two terminal branches—superior epi- gastric and musculo-phrenic.

The superior epigastric branch enters the fibres of the rectos abdominis muscle, and anastomoses with the epigastric branch of the external iliac, thus establishing a communication which becomes of great importance in any case of obstruction of the aorta or iliac arteries. b. The musculo-phrenic branch supplies the diaphragm, and runs outwards to anastomose with the intercostal arteries, as well as with the phrenic branches of the abdominal aorta. The other branches of the internal mammary are (c) comes nervi phrenici, a small branch accompanying the phrenic nerve and seldom seen ; (d) mediastinal and (e) pericardiac branches to those parts, from which small branches pass to form the “ sub-pleural mediastinal plexus ” (Turner); (/) anterior intercostals to the intercostal spaces, anastomosing with other intercostal branches ; and (g) perforating branches to the pectoral muscles and to the mamma. The vena comites of the internal mammary artery unite to open into the corresponding innominate or brachio-cephalic vein. 3. The Thyroid Axis (Fig. 179, 25) is a short thick trunk arising from the anterior surface of the subclavian close to the scalenus, which divides immediately into three branches, (a) inferior thyroid, (6) transversalis colli, and (c) supra-scapular or transversalis humeri. a. The Inferior Thyroid artery runs upwards and inwards, across the vertebral artery and behind the carotid sheath and sympathetic trunk, to the posterior aspect of the thyroid body, in which it anasto- moses with its fellow of the opposite side, and with both the superior thyroid arteries. Besides oesophageal, tracheal, and a small inferior laryngeal branch, it usually gives off a branch close to its origin, the ascending cervical, which ascends upon the vertebrae between the scalenus anticus and rectus capitis anticus major, supplying the pre- vertebral muscles and anastomosing with branches of the vertebral artery. The Inferior Thyroid veins pass down the front of the trachea, and frequently have a transverse communicating branch. They open into the innominate veins, the right crossing obliquely over the in- nominate artery. b. The Transverse Cervical artery runs transversely outward in front of the scalenus anticus and phrenic nerve, and has been seen, in the posterior triangle of the neck, to divide into superficial cervical and posterior scapular branches. The transverse cervical vein opens into the external jugular. This artery is frequently of small size or altogether wanting, the posterior scapular arising from the third part of the subclavian. c. The Supra-scapular artery runs outward in front of the scalenus339 DISTRIBUTION OF EIGHTH NERVE. Fig. 179.

It passes over the transverse ligament of the scapula to supply the dorsum (p. 32). The suprascapular vein opens into the external jugular. The Second Part of the Subclavian Artery (Fig. 179, 27) is placed behind the scalenus anticus, and has the same relations on both sides of the body. It has in front of it the platysma and cervical fascia, with the clavicular origin of the sterno-mastoid and the scalenus anticus ; and rests against the scalenus medius and the first dorsal nerve. Above it are the lower cervical nerves ; and below is the pleura with a small portion of the inner border of the first rib * The sub- clavian vein is quite below the level of the artery at this point, and separated by the scalenus anticus. The only branch of the second part of the subclavian artery is the superior intercostal artery, which arises usually to the inner side of the anterior scalenus on the left side, and is to be traced into the thorax by removing the pleura from the upper intercostal spaces on both sides. The superior intercostal artery (Fig. 178,11) descends into the thorax in front of the necks of the ribs, giving branches to the first and second intercostal spaces, and anastomosing with the upper intercostal artery from the aorta. The branches to the intercostal spaces divide into anterior and posterior branches, and are distributed like the aortic intercostals. The deep cervical branch arises from the superior inter- costal close to its origin, and passes backwards between the first rib and the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, to be distributed to the muscles of the back. * The phrenic nerve is commonly given as one of the anterior relations of this part of the artery, but it reaches the inner border of the scalenus above the vessel, and is in relation with the first part of the subclavian. 7.

The superior intercostal vein opens into the innominate vein. The Third Part of the Subclavian Artery has been dissected in the posterior triangle of the neck (p. 311). The Subclavian Vein is the continuation of the axillary- vein, and has been seen to lie below the level of its artery in the third part of its course. It then passes in front of the scalenus anticus, which muscle separates it from the second portion of the subclavian artery; and lastly lies in front of and a little below the first part of the artery, with the phrenic nerve intervening on both sides of the body, and on the right side the pneumo- gastric nerve also. Each subclavian vein joins the internal jugular vein of the same side to form the innominate vein, and at the point of junction of these two veins the thoracic duct opens on the left side, and the right lymphatic duct on the right side of the body. Branches.—The external and anterior jugular veins open into the subclavian vein outside the scalenus anticus, and the vertebral vein just before it joins the internal jugular. The Pneumo-gastric Nerve (Figs. 179 & 180) (8th pair) is only seen in its cervical portion at present. It is enclosed in the carotid sheath, lying between the jugular vein and the artery, and enters the superior aperture of the thorax, passing, on the right side, between the subclavian artery and the innominate vein, and on the left side between the common carotid and subclavian arteries and behind the innominate vein. Its Superior Laryngeal branch (14 & 9) curving forwards beneath the internal carotid artery, appears opposite the hyoid bone, and pierces the thyro-hyoid membrane to supply the mucous membrane of the larynx. Before entering the larynx, the nerve gives a small external laryngeal branch, which runs obliquely downwards under the sterno- thyroid muscle to supply the crico-thyroid, one of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx. The Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve (26 & 21) (inferior) is seen running along the side of the trachea between it and the oesophagus, and disappears beneath the lower border of the inferior constrictor of the pharynx. It takes a different course on the two sides of the body; on the right arising from the pneumo-gastric in the neck, and winding round the subclavian artery ; on the left arising in the thorax, and turning round the arch of the aorta. The Cardiac Nerves (17) are one or two slender branches of the pneumo-gastric in the lower part of the neck, running into the thorax to join the cardiac plexuses.342 SIDE OF THE NECK Fig. 180. f. .• Fig. 180.—Distribution of the eighth pair of nerves on the left side (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Gasserian ganglion of 5th nerve. 2. Internal carotid artery.THE SYMPATHETIC. 343 The Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 179, 9) (9th pair) appears below the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, hooking round the occipital artery and then curving forward superficially to the gTeat vessels. It then passes beneath the tendon of the digastric close to the hyoid bone, where it is seen in the angle between the two bellies of the muscle lying upon the liyo-glossus muscle, and finally disappears beneath the posterior border of the mylo-hyoid muscle to supply the muscles of the tongue (Fig. 180, 11). Its descending branch (ramus descendens noni) arises opposite the occipital artery, and runs downward and forward either upon or within the carotid sheath, to supply the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and omo-hyoid muscles, and to form one or more loops t^ith the communicans noni branch from the cervical plexus (Fig. 177, 7). The nerve to the thyro-hyoid muscle is a very delicate branch derived from the 9th nerve, just before it passes beneath the digastric. The Sympathetic (Figs. 179 & 180) in the neck lies behind the carotid sheath upon the prevertebral muscles. It is a greyish nerve which has three cervical ganglia developed upon it, of which only the upper two can now be seen, the lowest being on the neck of the first rib. The superior cervical ganglion (11 & 16) is a fusiform enlargement of the nerve behind the internal carotid artery, and lying upon the rectus capitis anticus major.

From Fig. 181.—Diagram of the superior, middle and inferior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic (drawn by J. T. Gray).THE CEKVICAL PLEXUS. 345 this ganglion branches of communication go to the fifth and sixth cervical nerves ; thyroid branches are distributed upon the inferior thyroid artery ; and the middle cardiac nerve passes into the thorax, communicating with the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The Spinal-Accessory Nerve (Fig. 179, 5) (8th pair) appears below the digastric and close to the transverse process of the atlas. It pierces the deep surface of the sterno-mastoid muscle, giving branches to it, and then emerging, crosses the posterior triangle to the trapezius, which it supplies. The Cervical Plexus (Fig. 177) is formed by the anterior branches of the four upper cervical nerves, but the loop from the 1st nerve to the 2nd is of very small size, and cannot be well seen in this stage of the dissection. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4tli nerves appear between the rectus capitis anticus major and the middle scalenus, lying beneath the sterno-mastoid. Each of these nerves communicates with the one above and below it, and gives off superficial and deep cervical branches. The superficial branches of the cervical plexus have been already dissected in the posterior triangle, and can now be traced to their source,—the great auricular, small occipital, and superficial cervical branches to the 2nd and 3rd nerves, and the descending branches to the 3rd and 4th nerves. The deep branches of the cervical plexus are— 1. Communicating branches with the 8th and 9th cranial nerves and the sympathetic, which will afterwards be dissected. 2. Muscular branches to the rectus capitis anticus major, rectus minor, and rectus lateralis. 3. The Communicans noni (7) usually consisting of two branches from the 2nd and 3rd nerves, which join the descendens noni branch. 4. The Phrenic nerve (n) arising from the 4th nerve (or from the 3rd & 4th) and having in addition a branch of communication with the 5th. It lies upon the scalenus anticus, getting to its inner border at the lower part of the neck, and has a communicating branch from the sympathetic, and also, frequently, from the nerve to the subclavius from the brachial plexus. The phrenic will subse- quently be traced to the diaphragm in the dissection of the thorax. 5. Muscular branches are derived from the plexus, which go to the sterno-mastoid, levator anguli scapulae, and trapezius muscles, and also to the scalenus medius.THE FACE. 346 The Face. The face is a region in which it will be convenient to make different dissections on the two sides, i.e., of the muscles and vessels on one, and of the nerves on the other ; and the dissectors are there- fore advised to adopt this method of proceeding. Before commencing the dissection, the student should observe the externa] anatomy of the eye and its appendages, so that they may be seen in as natural a condition as possible (Fig. 182). On the margin of the orbit is the supercilium or eyebrow, a ridge of thickened skin covered with hairs. The eyelids or palpebrce are two thin folds composed of cartilage, muscle, and fascia, covered by the skin externally, and lined by the conjunctiva continued from the surface of the eyeball. The points of junction of the two lids are called the inner and outer canthi, and along the free border of the lids will be seen the cilia or eyelashes, which in health curve upwards from the upper, and downwards from the lower lid. Before opening the lids they should be drawn forcibly outward towards the temple, in order to make tense and prominent the little Surgery.—The tendo oculi is important as the guide to the lachrymal sac when it is necessary to introduce a knife into it in cases of lachrymal abscess, and the stu- dent should practise this little operation at once as follows:— Drawing the eyelids outward to render the tendon tense, a narrow knife held with the back towards the nose is entered vertically immediately below it, and passed downwards and a little backwards tendo oculi at the inner cantlius.

The lids being separated, close to the inner canthus will be seen a small space called the lacus lachrymalis, and on the free margin of each lid close to this will be seen a little eminence (papilla lachrymalis) perforated by a minute hole, the punctum lachrymale (g). A small probe introduced vertically through the punctum will pass hori- zontally along the canaliculus into the lachrymal sac (12), situated in the groove in the lachrymal bone and beneath the tendo oculi. This is a delicate fibrous bag wider above than Fig. 1S3. below, where it is con- tinuous with the nasal duct. It is lined with mucous membrane having a ciliated epi- thelium. The canali- culi may be opened up upon the probe or with a fine-pointed pair of scissors, when a good- sized probe may be readily introduced into the sac and be pushed down, into the nasal duct and nose.

Close to the inner canthus is a reddish body, the caruncula lachry- malis (8), composed of mucous follicles, and external to it is a minute semilunar fold of conjunctiva, called the jplica semilunaris (7), the representative of the membrana nictitans of birds, crocodiles, and batra- cliia. The conjunctiva is the mucous lining of the lids, and is continued on to the eyeball, where it is loosely attached to the sclerotic but inseparably to the cornea. If the conjunctiva be carefully divided over the sclerotic, the attachments of the muscles of the eyeball may be seen. Fig. 184. The student should recognise with his finger the prominences of the nasal, malar, and jaw bones, and also the margin of the orbit ; and it will be well also to examine the state of tension of the eye-ball by pressing upon it gently with the fore- fingers, since this varies very much according to the freshness of the subject. Opportunity should be taken also to examine the external ear, and, if possible, to see the membrana tym- pani with a speculum. The Pinna (Fig. 183) is composed of cartilage covered with skin, and is divided into the following parts :—The outer rim is the helix (1), and that next to Fig. 184.—The pinna and its muscles, as seen from behind (from Wilson, after Arnold). 1, 1.

The deep cavity leading to the meatus externus is the concha (9), and the little nodule in front of it the tragus (10), the cor- responding nodule behind being the antitragus (n). The lowest part of the ear is the lobule, which consists of fat. The extrinsic muscles of the ear (Attrahens, Attollens, and Retra- hens) have been seen in the dissection of the scalp. Various small muscles have been described as passing from one point to another of the cartilage of the pinna, but do not require special description. They can be sufficiently seen in Figs. 183 and 184, and will not repay the trouble of dissection. [The cheeks are now to be distended with cotton wool and the lips carefully sewn together. A little piece of wool may also be intro- duced beneath the eyelids with advantage. An incision is to be made from the temple in front of the ear, along the jaw to the chin (the scalp having been already dissected), and the skin is to be care- fully reflected towards the median line. A cut around the orbit and mouth will avoid interference with the eyelids and lips. All muscular fibres and vessels are to be carefully preserved, but the small nerves are to be cut away, together 'with all the loose fat. The parotid gland in front of the ear is to be preserved, and its duct traced across the face below the malar bone.] Muscles of the Face or Muscles of Expression. The Orbicularis Palpebrarum (Fig. 186, 4) is a broad muscle surrounding the orbit and attached to its inner angle, being continuous above with the fibres of the occipito-frontalis (v. p. 293). It arises from the internal angular process of the frontal bone, from the tendo oculi passing between the nasal process of the superior maxilla and the inner extremities of the tarsal cartilages, and from the nasal process itself. Its fibres surround the orbit and are attached to the skin ; those passing on the lids are called the palpebral fibres (or palpebralis muscle), and are attached externally to the malar bone and external tarsal ligament. The orbicularis palpebrarum is the muscle which closes the eye- lids, and is therefore the direct antagonist of the levator palpebrae. The Corrugator Supercilii will be seen by removing the portion of the orbicularis covering the brow. It arises from the inner part of the sirperciliary ridge, and is inserted into the orbicularis about the centre of the eyebrow. The Pyramidalis Nasi (Fig. 185, 1) is a small slip of muscle lying along the nasal bone, continuous with the occipito-frontalis350 THE FACE. above, and lost on the nasal cartilage, where it joins the tendon of the compressor naris. The Levator Labii Superioris Alseque Nasi (Fig. 186,8) arises from the upper part oi the nasal process of the superior maxilla close to the margin of the orbit; it widens as it descends, and divides into two slips, which are inserted into the alar cartilage of the nose and into the upper lip. The Compressor Naris (Fig. 185, 3) is to be traced beneatli the preceding muscle to its origin from the canine fossa of the superior maxilla. The muscle is triangular in shape, and passes to be inserted on the bridge of the nose, where it unites with the opposite muscle and the pyramidalis nasi. The Depressor Alae Nasi (Fig. 185, 7) is a small muscle which can only be properly seen by everting the lip (at a later stage) and removing the mucous membrane. It arises from the myrti- form fossa over the incisor teeth of the upper jaw, and is inserted into the posterior part of the coliunna and the ala of the nose. The Orbicularis Oris (Fig. 186, 7) is the sphincter muscle surrounding the mouth. It is joined by all the other muscles which are inserted into the lips, and specially by the bucci- nator on each side, the fibres of which interlace with it. It is attached to each side of the septum of the nose by a small slip (naso-labialis) (Fig. 185, 9), and to the superior maxilla close to the canine tooth on each side, by small slips which have been named the fasciculi acces- Fig. 185.—Muscles of the nose (from Wilson, after Arnold). 1.

Professor Ellis has described similar attachments to the lower jaw close to the canine teeth. The Levator Labii Superiors Proprius (Fig. 186, 9) arises from the superior maxilla and margin of the malar hone above the infra-orbital foramen, and is inserted into the upper lip externally to the slip from the common eleva The Levator Anguli Ori fossa of the superior maxilla immediately below the infra- orbital foramen, and passes downwards and outwards be- neath the preceding muscle to the angle of the mouth, joining the fibres of the orbi- cularis. The Zygomaticus (Fig. 186) is either a single muscle, or has two slips forming the zygomaticus major and minor. The Zygomaticus major (11) arises from the malar bone close to its junction with the zygoma, and passes obliquely to the angle of the mouth, where it blends with the orbi- cularis oris. (Fig. 186) arises from the canine Fig. 186. Fig. 186.—Muscles of the head and face (from Wilson). 1. Frontal portion of the occipito- frontalis. 2. Its occipital portion. 3. Its aponeurosis. 4.

The Zygomaticus minor (io), much smaller, usually looks like a part of the orbicularis palpebrarum ; it arises from the malar bone in front of the preceding, and is inserted between it and the levator labii superioris, with which it unites. On the side of the jaw will be seen the insertion of the Platysma Myoides, continuous more or less with the orbicularis oris at the angle of the mouth, and with the muscles below the lip. Occasionally there is a strong slip passing transversely from the fascia over the masseter to the angle of the mouth, and called the E-isorius Muscle of Santorini. The Depressor Anguli Oris (Fig. 186, 13) (triangularis menti) is a triangular muscle arising from the outer surface of the lower jaw, below and a little external to the mental foramen, and inserted into the angle of the mouth. The Depressor Labii Inferioris (Fig. 186, 12) (quadratus menti) arises from the outer surface of the lower jaw, between the symphysis and the mental foramen, and ascends obliquely to meet its fellow in the median line at the lower lip, thus leaving a triangular interval between them. The Levator Menti (Fig. 186, 14) is a triangular muscle placed internally to the depressor of the lower lip, arising from the incisive fossa of the lower jaw and inserted into the skin of the chin. It is best dissected by everting the lower lip and removing the mucous membrane. All the muscles of the face, muscles of expression, are supplied by the facial nerve (portio dura of 7th). In health the muscles of the two sides of the face antagonise one another, and an equilibrium is unconsciously maintained ; but should the nerve of one side be divided, or become paralysed from disease of the temporal bone, the balance of power will be destroyed, and the face will be at once drawn to the healthy side by the preponderating muscles. The paralysed side will remain immoveable, the eye will be open, and the patient will be unable to whistle, etc. The Parotid Gland is the largest of the salivary glands, and is placed between the ear and the lower jaw, its superficial part over- lapping the masseter muscle and being called the socia parotidis. It reaches as high as the zygoma and as far back as the mastoid process, and below, it is separated from the submaxillary gland by the stylo- maxillary ligament. Its deep surface presents three processes ; one occupies the posterior part of the glenoid fossa, a second accompanies the internal maxillary artery beneath the lower jaw, and the third passes backward beneath the sterno-mastoid, and reaches the root of353 THE FACIAL ARTERY. the styloid process and the deep vessels and nerves of the neck. The duct of Stenson (ductus Stenonis) arises from the anterior part below the socia parotidis, and passes transversely across the masseter, to open into the mouth through the buccinator muscle opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. Immediately below the duct is a large branch of the facial nerve, and above it the transverse facial artery. The gland is traversed by the external carotid artery, which gives off its two terminal branches (temporal and internal maxillary) in its substance; by the external jugular vein ; and by the facial and guriculo-temporal nerves,jirom~both of which it receives branches. The structiire’oT’the parotid is that of a compound racemose gland, like the other salivary glands. It receives parotid branches from the temporal artery, and its special nervous supply from the auriculo-temporal and sympathetic nerves. [The remains of the platysma are to be removed to show the facial artery and vein in front of the masseter, and the artery is to be fol- lowed out to the inner angle of the eye with as little injury to the muscles as possible.] The Facial Artery (Fig. 187) [external carotid], the cervical por- tion of which has been already dissected (p. 334), appears on the face immediately in front of the masseter muscle, where it lies on the lower jaw and is crossed by the platysma. It then passes upwards and in- wards beneath the zygomatici muscles to the side of the nose, lying upon the buccinator, levator anguli oris, and levator labii superioris muscles in its course. At the side of the nose it is crossed by the outer portion of the levator labii superioris aheque nasi, and reaches the angle of the orbit to anastomose with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery. This is therefore one of the points of communi- cation between the. external and internal carotid vessels. Branches.—As the artery crosses the jaw it gives— 1.

Surgery.—The facial artery may he compressed or tied immedi- ately in front of the masseter, where its pulsation can he readily felt through the thin platysma. The position of the coronary arteries immediately beneath the mucous membrane should he borne in mind in operating for hare-lip or cancer, as it is necessary to thrust the hare-lip pin deeply into the substance of the lip, in order to control J the haemorrhage effectually. The Facial Vein commences at the inner angle of the orbit in the angular vein, formed by the frontal and supra-orbital veins. It then runs obliquely across the face to the edge of the masseter, where it lies close to the outer side of the artery, and, after receiving the anterior internal maxillary branch from the pterygoid region, passes into the neck to join the internal jugular vein. It is crossed by the zygomatici muscles, but lies upon Stenson’s duct. Its branches corre- spond to those of the artery. The Transverse Facial Artery (Fig. 187, 12) arises from the temporal artery in the parotid gland, and appears on the face above the parotid duct, to run transversely inwards towards the nose and anastomose with the facial artery. In a well-injected body the terminations of the infra-orbital and inferior dental arteries will be found emerging at the infra-orbital and mental foramina, with branches of the 2nd and 3rd divisions of the 5tli nerve. The infra-orbital foramen will be found between the levator labii superioris and levator anguli oris, and the mental fora- men beneath the depressor anguli oris. The frontal and supra-orbital arteries should also be traced if the scalp has not already been fully dissected (v. p. 294). [The skin being removed from the opposite side of the face in the same way as above directed, a dissection is to be made of the nerves alone, all other tissues being sacrificed for that purpose. To find the facial nerve, the best way is to cut transversely into the parotid gland about half an inch below the zygoma, and to dissect carefully to some depth to reach a large branch of the nerve, which passes through its substance. One branch having been found, it is to be followed care- fully backwards and forwards, when it will lead to other branches ; and the parotid gland is to be removed piecemeal to show the rami- fications of the nerve, which are then to be traced as far as possible towards the median line.] The Facial Nerve (portio dura of the 7th pair) (Fig. 188, 17) leaves the skull at the stylo-mastoid foramen, and gives off immedi- ately the posterior auricular, digastric, and stylo-hyoid branches. a a 2356 THE FACE. The ■posterior auricular nerve (13) winds below the meatus to the back of the ear and communicates with the great auricular nerve (23). It divides into an auricular branch, which supplies the retrahens nurem muscle, and an occipital branch which supplies the posterior belly of the occipito-frontalis. The digastric and stylo-hyoid nerves (21) arise together and supply the corresponding muscles. A branch from the digastric nerve perforates the digastric muscle and communicates with the glosso- pharyngeal nerve, and the stylo-hyoid nerve communicates with the sympathetic on the external carotid. Passing forward deeply in the parotid gland, the facial nerve divides into two large trunks, the temporo-facial (22) and the cervico- facial (19) divisions, from which numerous branches arise, causing by their interlacement the appearance termed the pcs anserinus, or goose- foot. The temporo-facial receives communicating branches from the auriculo-temporal nerve (5th) in front of the pinna, and the cervico- facial division receives one or two branches from the great auricular nerve of the cervical plexus. From each division of the facial nerve three sets of branches are derived, whose direction is indicated by their names. Temporo- ( Temporal (4). Cervico- ( Buccal (24). facial J Malar (12). facial < Supra-Maxillary (30). division ( Infra-orbital (16) division ( Infra-maxillary (34). These branches all ramify upon the face and supply the facial muscles, communicating with the several divisions of the 5th nerve, excepting the infra-maxillary, which run below the jaw to the neck and communicate with the superficial cervical nerve (31). The branches are to be traced to all the “muscles of expression,” and also to the buccinator, one of the muscles of mastication as well as of expression. The three divisions of the 5th Nerve appear upon the face, and each of them will be found three times in front of the ear. The First or Ophthalmic Division (Fig. 188) appears (1) as the supra-trochlear nerve (6) at the inner angle of the orbit; (2) at the supra-orbital notch as the supra-orbital nerve (8), which has been traced to the forehead ; and (3) as the nasal nerve (18), which will now be found emerging from between the nasal bone and lateral cartilage on the side of the nose. (Small terminal twigs of the infra-trochlear and lachrymal nerves may also be sometimes found with care.) The Second or Superior Maxillary Division (Fig. 188) appears (1) as the infra-orbital nerve (20) at the infra-orbital foramen, between357 THE FACIAL NERVE. the levator labii superior is and the levator anguli oris, and is to he traced to the npper lip rvhich it supplies with numerous large Fig. 188.

The Third or Inferior Maxillary Division (Fig. 188) ap- pears (1) as the mental nerve (32) at the mental foramen, and is to be traced to the chin and lower lip ; (2) as the buccal nerve (26) upon the surface of the buccinator muscle, where it will be found lying beneath, but communicating with, the facial nerve ; and (3) as the auriculo-temporal nerve (3) piercing the parotid gland and running upwards over the zygoma immediately in front of the ear. These are all purely sensory nerves (with the exception, perhaps, of the buccal nerve, which is supposed to be of a mixed character). They all join freely with the facial nerve, and supply sensation to the whole of the skin of the face, except that covering the parotid gland, which is supplied by the great auricular nerve of the cervical plexus, hence called auriculo-parotidean. [The anatomy of the eyelids and of the nasal cartilages can be examined on either side of the face by removing the superjacent tissues.] The Eyelids (Fig. 182).—On removing the thin palpebral fibres of the orbicularis from the lids, a piece of thin fibrous tissue will be seen extending from the margin of the orbit to the lid, which is called the palpebral ligament. It is continuous with the periosteum of the skull at the margin of the orbit, and is attached to the edge of the tarsal cartilage in each lid. The tarsal cartilage is larger in the upper than the lower lid, being semilunar in shape in the former, and nearly straight in the latter. Each is attached externally by a little tarsal ligament to the margin of the orbit, whilst internally the tendo oculi divides to be attached to both cartilages, and thus holds them in posi- tion. The fibres of the orbicularis must be cut away from the tendo oculi to show it thoroughly, and it will be seen to be attached to the nasal process of the superior maxilla immediately in front of the groove for the lachrymal sac. Beneath the palpebral ligament, in the upper lid, will be found the expansion of the tendon of the levator palpebrse superioris attached to the tarsal cartilage. Both lids are lined with conjunctiva, on removing which the Meibomian glands may be seen to groove the cartilages.359 THE PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGION. The structures composing the upper eyelid are— 1. Skin. 2. Orbicularis palpebrarum. 3. Palpebral ligament. 4. Tendon of levator palpebrae. 5. Tarsal cartilage. 6. Meibomian glands. 7. Conjunctiva. The structures in the lower lid are the same, minus the levator palpebrce. This will be the best opportunity to dissect the Tensor Tarsi Muscle of Horner, by dividing the outer tarsal ligaments and de- taching the eyelids, so as to turn them over the nose and expose their internal surface. By removing the conjunctiva over the tendo oculi, the two little slips of muscular fibre will be seen above and below it. The muscle arises from the ridge on the lachrymal bone, and is in- serted into the tarsal cartilages and canaliculi. Cartilages of the Nose (Figs. 189 and 190).—Only the lateral cartilages and cartilages of the aperture on each side can now be seen, the cartilage of the septum being dissected with the Nose. The lateral cartilage is triangular, its posterior border being continuous with the nasal bone and the nasal process of the maxillary bone, and its anterior border being separated from that of its fellow of the oppo- site side by the edge of the septum. The cartilage of the aperture (alar) is semicircular in shape, and is bent upon itself in front, so as to surround the nostril in front. It has no attachment to bone, being embedded in the dense cellular tissue of the ala nasi, in which there are frequently two or three little addi- tional nodules, sesamoid cartilages. The cartilages of the two sides adjoin at the tip of the nose, and are attached to the lateral cartilages by fibrous tissue. The Pteeygo-Maxillary Begion. [The head being laid on one side, the facial nerve and parotid duct are to be divided and turned forward, and the remains, if any, of the parotid gland are to be cleaned out from between the ear and the jaw, the auriculo-temporal nerve being carefully preserved. The surface of the masseter muscle is then to be cleaned.] The Masseter (Fig. 186, 15) is the most superficial muscle of mastication and is divisible into a superficial and a deep portion, a3G0 THE PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGION. small part of the latter being seen behind and above the fibres of the former. The superficial and more tendinous part arises from the anterior two-thirds of the lower border of the zygomatic arch formed Fig. 189. Fig. 190. by the malar and temporal bones, and slightly from the superior maxilla; it passes downwards and backwards to be inserted into the angle of the jaw and the lower half of the ramus. The deeper and more fleshy part arises from the posterior third of the lower border of the zygoma, and also from the inner surface of the bone; it passes downwards and a little forwards to be inserted into the outer side of the upper half of the ramus of the jaw, extending to the root of the coronoid process.

The piece of bone with the masseter attached can then be turned down, when the deep fibres of the muscle will be seen attached to the lower jaw, and the masseteric branch of artery and nerve will be found behind the coronoid process, and must neces- sarily be divided. The temporal muscle is to be cleaned and the fat beneath the masseter removed, so as to expose the buccinator muscle thoroughly, together with its branch of nerve and artery, which appear in front of the coronoid process, and are to be preserved.] The Temporal Muscle (Fig. 196, 2) arises from the whole of the temporal fossa and from the under surface of the temporal fascia, which has been seen to be attached to the whole length of the temporal ridge. Its fibres converge to a tendon, which is inserted into the apex of the outer surface of the coronoid process, and into the inner surface of the coronoid process and ramus of the lower jaw, as far as the last molar tooth. It is also connected with the pterygo- maxillary ligament. [With the saw and bone-forceps the coronoid process and the anterior part of the ramus of the jaw are to be carefully cut off, and turned up. The neck of the jaw is then to be sawn through trans- versely just below the condyle, and the ramus divided transversely at the level of the molar teeth. In making this last cut the saw should only go through half the thickness of the jaw, after which the bone-forceps can be applied at the upper border so as to split the piece of bone, and allow of its removal in two pieces without injury to the nerve. On removing the portion of ramus thus separated, the periosteirm will probably be left behind, and on this being dissected away, the inferior dental nerve and artery will be seen lying on the internal lateral ligament before entering the dental foramen, and in front of these the lingual (gustatory) nerve. Crossing both nerves transversely at the upper part of the space now exposed is the external pterygoid nnisele,with the internal maxillary artery lying either upon or beneath it. If superficial to the muscle it had better be cleaned, divided, and held aside with a hook.] The External Pterygoid Muscle (Fig. 191, 1) arises by two heads, one from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate, and the tuberosity of the palate and maxillary bones ; the other from the under surface of the sphenoid below the pterygoid crest. Its fibres run transversely to be inserted into the hollow on the front of the neck of the jaw, and into the inter-articular fibro-cartilage of the joint.362 THE .PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGION. Temporo-Maxillary Articulation.—The external lateral liga- ment (Fig. 192, 5) is a short thick hand of fibres broader above than below, and passes obliquely downwards and backwards from the lower border of the root of the zygoma to the neck of the jaw. It is continuous with the capsular ligament, which is attached to the margins of the articular surfaces, and is sometimes described as con- sisting of anterior, posterior, and internal portions. By dividing the ligaments, the inter-articular cartilage and the synovial membranes above and below it will be brought into view. The inter-articular fibro-cartilage (Fig. 193, 3) is seen to fit into the glenoid cavity, and its upper surface is accordingly concavo-convex from before backwards, the lower surface being concave. The cartilage, together with the condyle, being detached from the temporal bone and turned forward with the external pterygoid muscle, will be found to be oval in outline and thicker at the margins than in the centre, which is occasionally perforated. The internal lateral ligament (Fig. 194, 4) now fully exposed, is a membranous band, narrow above, where it is attached to the spine of the sphenoid bone and is crossed by the internal maxillary artery, and widening below to be attached to the projecting margin of the dental foramen. It is covered by the inferior dental nerve and artery at Fig. 191.—The two pterygoid muscles (from Wilson).

The Internal Pterygoid Muscle (Fig. 191, 3) is placed beneath the internal lateral ligament. It arises from the internal surface of the external pterygoid plate, and from the tuberosity of the palate Fig. 193. Fig. 194. bone and superior maxilla, and is inserted into the inner surface of the angle of the lower jaw, its fibres running parallel to the superficial portion of the masseter. In many subjects a portion of the internal pterygoid arises from the outer surface of the tuberosity of the superior maxilla, anterior to the fibres of the pterygoideus extemus (Fig. 196). The Buccinator (Fig. 196, 14) forms the greater part of the cheek, and has been partly seen in the dissection of the face. It arises from the alveolar border of the superior maxilla opposite the molar teeth ; from a corresponding portion of the inferior maxilla ; and between the jaws from the anterior border of the pterygo-maxillary ligament.

The buccinator is perforated by the duct of the parotid gland opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. The Pterygo-Maxillary Ligament (Fig. 197) is a white fibrous band extending between the internal pterygoid plate and the lower jaw, close to the last molar tooth. By its anterior border it gives attachment to the buccinator, and by its posterior border to the superior constrictor of the pharynx ; it thus establishes the connec- tion between the cavities of the mouth and the pharynx, the mucous membrane covering its inner surface. The temporal, masseter, external and internal pterygoids, and buc- cinator are classed together as the Muscles of Mastication. The temporal, masseter, and internal pterygoid muscles close the jaws, but the masseter and internal pterygoid draw the lower jaw forward, whilst the temporal draws it back, thus producing the antero-pos- terior movement. The lateral movements of the jaw are produced by the alternate action of the two external pterygoid muscles, which, if acting together, protrude the chin. The principal action of the buccinator is to keep the food between the teeth during mastication, but it also expels air from the mouth (and hence the name “ trumpeter ”), as is well seen in using the blowpipe. The muscles of mastication are all sullied by the motor portion of the third division of the 5tli nerve, but the buccinator is also, and principally, supplied by the facial nerve (7th) ; as is shown by the fact that in paralysis of that nerve the buccinator fails in its action, and food collects between the teeth and the cheek. The Internal Maxillary Artery (Fig. 195) is seen in this dissection in its first and second portions, the third being in the splreno-maxillary fossa. One of the terminal branches of the external carotid artery, it arises in the parotid gland immediately behind the neck of the jaw. The First Part of the internal maxillary artery, with its accom- panying veins, lies between the neck of the jaw and the internal lateral ligament. It gives off a descending branch, the Inferior dented, and an ascending branch, the Middle meningeal. a. The Inferior dental artery (ii) descends on the internal lateral ligament to the inferior dental foramen, by which it enters the lower jaw; it then runs in a canal in the substance of that bone, supplying the posterior teeth, and, after giving an incisor branch to365 THE INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. the front teeth, appears on the face at the mental foramen with the third division of the 5th nerve. Immediately before entering the dental foramen it gives off the mylo-hyoid branch, winch pierces the Fig. 195. internal lateral ligament with a nerve of the same name, and runs in a groove on the internal surface of the lower jaw to the cutaneous surface of the mylo-hyoid and to the digastric muscle, joining the submental artery. b. The Middle meningeal artery (Fig. 195, 7) ascends beneath the external pterygoid muscle, which must be turned forwards with the Fig. 195.—The internal maxillary artery (from University College Museum). 1.

It passes between the roots of the auriculo-temporal nerve to the foramen spinosum, by which it enters the skull. Before doing so, it gives off the meningea parva to enter the foramen ovale, and a tympanic branch to enter the Glasserian fissure. The Second Part of the internal maxillary artery varies in position in different subjects. It is always intermuscular, but it may lie between the temporal and external pterygoid, or between the external and internal pterygoid muscles. If it lies superficially to the external pterygoid muscle, it passes between its two heads to reach the pterygo-maxillary fossa. Its branches are all muscular, i.e. to the muscles of mastication. There are two deep temporal branches (anterior (2) and posterior (3)) running in the substance of the temporal muscle; a masseteric branch (15) of small size passing through the sigmoid notch to the under surface of the muscle (now neces- sarily divided); two pterygoid branches, uncertain in origin and course ; and a buccal branch (10) which generally pierces the external pterygoid muscle to accompany the nerve to the surface of the buccinator. The Posterior dental artery (6), one of the branches of the third part of the internal maxillary artery, can be seen entering one of the fora- mina on the posterior surface of the superior maxilla, in which it ramifies, supplying that bone and the molar teeth. The Internal Maxillary Vein receives branches corresponding to those of the artery, and between the muscles forms the pterygoid plexus, which communicates with the facial vein by the anterior internal maxillary vein. It enters the parotid gland, to join the temporal vein and form the external jugular. The Inferior Maxillary Nerve (Figs. 196 and 197) (3rd division of 5th) as soon as it emerges from the foramen ovale divides into a motor and a sensory portion, the latter, however, having a few motor fibres mingled with it. The Motor Portion (Fig. 196) with wfiicli there are also sensory fibres, is of small size, is placed externally to the sensory portion, and is distributed to the muscles of mastication, running with the cor- responding branches of the internal maxillary artery. Its branches are, anterior and posterior temporal (2 & 3), masseteric (j5), pterygoid and buccal (10), and are difficult to find, except the last, which is of good size, and may be traced to the surface of the buccinator, where it communicates with the facial nerve, which has probably most to do with the supply to that muscle. The Sensory Portion (Fig. 197) gives off a branch to the internal367 THE LINGUAL NERVE. pterygoid which is connected with the otic ganglion, and divides close to the base of the skull into three trunks, the Lingual Nerve (or gus- tatory) the most anterior ; the Inferior Dental Nerve (which has some motor fibres) in the middle ; and the Auriculo-Temporal Nerve most posterior and smallest.

Beneath the external pterygoid the nerve is joined at an acute angle by the small chorda tynipani nerve (7), a branch of the facial nerve in the temporal bone, which passes through the tym- panum between the handle of the malleus and the long process of the incus, and emerges through the canal of Huguier at the inner side of the Glasserian fissure, to which it should now be traced. The Inferior Dental Nerve (Fig. 197, 18) has a branch of com- munication with the lingual trunk, and then descends upon the ptervgoideus intemus, and afterwards upon the internal lateral ligament, to the dental foramen. After entering the bone it supplies all the teeth of the lower jaw, either directly or by its incisor branch (22), and emerges at the mental foramen with its accompanying artery. Immediately before entering the dental foramen it gives off the mylo-hyoid nerve (17), which pierces the internal lateral ligament with the accompanying artery, and, after running in a groove on the inner surface of the bone, is distributed on the cutaneous surface of the mylo-liyoid muscle, and also supplies the anterior belly of the digastric. The Auriculo-Temporal Nerve (Fig. 197, 9) passes horizontally backwards behind the temporo-maxillary articulation, and often has two roots of origin which embrace the middle meningeal artery. It then turns upwards in front of the ear through the parotid gland, and is distributed on the temple (v. p. 294). It gives branches to the ear (auricular), to the parotid (of which it is the excitory nerve ac- cording to Bernard), and to the joint; and communicates with the facial nerve and with the sympathetic. The Submaxillary Region. The Submaxillary region has been partially dissected with the anterior triangle of the neck. It is seen to be bounded superficially by the two bellies of the digastric muscle and by the lower jaw, thus being triangular in shape, and to contain the submaxillary gland and a portion of the facial arteiy. [The facial arteiy is to be divided at the jaw and turned back with the submaxillary gland, when the mylo-hyoid muscle forming the floor of the submaxillary triangle will be exposed, and on its sur- face will be seen the mylo-hyoid branch of artery and nerve derived from the inferior dental trunks, the artery anastomosing with the submental branch of the facial. By cutting through the digastric muscle at its insertion, detaching it and the stylo-hyoid from the hyoid bone, and turning them back, the mylo-hyoid muscle will be fully exposed, and should be put on the stretch by means of a hook attached to the larynx.] B BTHE SUBMAXILLARY REGION. 370 The Mylo-hyoid Muscle (Fig. 197, 25) arises from the mylo- hyoid ridge on the inner surface of the lower jaw, and its fibres pass downwards and forwards to be inserted into the body of the hyoid bone, and to meet the muscle of the opposite side in a median tendon between the hyoid bone and the lower jaw, thus forming the floor of the mouth. The mylo-hyoid is an elevator of the hyoid bone, and is supplied (with the anterior belly of the digastric) by the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior dental nerve. [The mylo-hyoid is to be detached from the lower jaw and turned forward, when three structures will be seen lying in the following order from above downwards on the hyo-glossus muscle, viz. the lingual nerve [5tli], the deep portion of the submaxillary gland until Wharton’s duct, and the hypoglossal nerve [9th]. In addition, immediately below the 9th nerve there is very frequently a large vein corresponding to the lingual artery. In front of the hyo-glossus will be seen the genio-hyoid stretching between the chin and the hyoid bone, and a few fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus, together with a branch (ranine) of the lingual artery. The jaw being divided just externally to the genio-hyoid can be turned up, and the tongue being drawn out of the mouth, the fold of mucous membrane forming the frcenum linguce will be seen, and may be divided so as to allow all the parts to be put on the stretch with hooks ; the dissection can be proceeded with by cleaning the submaxillary gland and its duct.] The Submaxillary Gland (Fig. 197, 19) consists of two portions, one, the larger, placed superficially on the mylo-hyoid in the sub- maxillary triangle, and the other winding round the posterior margin of the mylo-hyoid to rest on the hyo-glossus. From this deep portion the duct (Wharton’s) arises, and lies at first between the lingual and hypoglossal nerves, but at the anterior part of the hyo-glossus will be found ascending beneath the lingual nerve to lie at a higher level than it. If followed beneath the mucous membrane of the mouth, the duct will be found to cross again over the lingual nerve at the side of the tongue, and to open into the mouth close to the fraenum linguae. The Sublingual Gland (Fig. 197) is seen beneath the mucous membrane by the side of the tongue, and lies on the genio-hyo-glossus close to Wharton’s duct, into which several of its ducts (ductus Riviniani) open, the others opening into the mouth in a crescent near the fraenum. The Lingual Nerve (Fig. 198, 1) (Gustatory of 5th) appears at the anterior border of the pterygoideus internus, where it lies against the pterygo-maxillary ligament, and afterwards runs between371 THE LINGUAL NERVE. the jaw and the mucous membrane of the mouth to reach the hyo- glossus, upon which it is at first placed above Wharton’s duct and the 9th nerve. Upon the hyo-glossus it crosses the duct and lies below it, but if followed to the side of the tongue will be found to pass again beneath the duct, and to be distributed to the side and Fig. 198. tip of the tongue, supplying the fungiform and filiform papilla). Branches of communication pass across the hyo-glossus to the 9th nerve, and a little below the level of the trunk, opposite the deep portion of the submaxillary gland, may be found the following ganglion. The submaxillary ganglion (2) is of small size and lies below the lingual nerve. It has three roots, the sensory derived from the lingual; the motor from the facial (7th) by means of the chorda Fig. 198.— Nerves of the tongue (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

The branches of distribution are given to the submaxillary gland. The chorda tympani is afterwards prolonged to the inferior lingualis muscle of the tongue. The Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 198, 15) (9th)* has been seen crossing the upper part of the anterior triangle, after hooking round the occipital artery, to dis- appear beneath the poste- rior border of the mylo- hyoid. It is now seen to lie on the hyo-glossus, which separates it from the lingual artery, and after communi- cating with the lingual nerve, it passes on to the genio- liyo-glossus muscle and the under surface of the tongue. It gives branches in this part of its course to the stylo- glossus, hyo-glossus, genio- hyoid, and genio-hyo-glossus muscles, and also to the in- trinsic muscles of the tongue itself. The Hyo-Glossus (Fig. 199, 6) is a scpuare muscle whicli arises from the body of the hyoid bone close to the median line, from the upper margin of the whole length of its great cornu, and * Lingual nerve of Harrison.

It is inserted into the side of the tongue, where its fibres decussate with those of the stylo-glossus. It is sometimes described as consisting of three separate portions—basio-glossus, kerato-glossus, and cliondro-glossus. The hyo-glossus draws the sides of the tongue downward. It is supplied by the 9th nerve. The Stylo-Glossus (Fig. 199, 9) arises from near the tip of the styloid process and from the stylo-maxillary ligament, and passing obliquely forwards and downwards, reaches the side of the tongue, into which it is inserted, decussating with the hyo-glossus and joining the fibres of the lingualis. The stylo-glossus raises the margins of the tongue and draws it upwards and backwards, and therefore hack into the mouth when it has been protruded, thus assisting the anterior fibres of the genio- hyo-glossus. It is supplied by the 9th nerve. The Stylo-Pharyngeus (Fig. 199, n) arises from the root of the styloid process on its inner side, and passes downward to disappear between the upper and middle constrictors of the pharynx opposite the hyoid bone. Its insertion will be seen in the dissection of the pharynx.* The stylo-pharyngeus is supplied by the glosso-pharyngeal ner :e, which winds round its posterior border. [The hyo-glossus is to be divided near the hyoid bone to expose the lingual artery, the branches of which are to be cleaned. The tongue being put on the stretch, all remains of mucous membrane covering the genio-hyoid and genio-hyo-glossus muscles are to be removed and the muscles cleaned.] The Lingual Artery (Fig. 200) has been seen for a short distance in the anterior triangle, viz. from its origin from the external carotid until crossed by the hyo-glossus. It was crossed by the hyo-glossus, digastric, and stylo-hyoid muscles, and by the hypoglossal nerve, and is now seen to lie against the origin of the middle constrictor of the pharynx immediately above the hyoid bone, and then to pass on to the genio-hyo-glossus, by which it is conducted to the tip of the tongue. Its branches are four in number :— * It will assist the student in remembering the origins of the muscles from the styloid process if he notice that the origins are inversely as the insertions, i.c. that the muscle which arises highest is inserted lowest down. Thus the order of the origins from above downwards is stylo-pharyngeus, stylo-hyoid, and stylo-glossus.THE SUBMAXILLARY REGION. 374 1.

The Ranine (2) is the termination of the lingual artery, and after leaving the genio-hyo-glossus enters the under surface of the tongue, to be continued in its substance to the tip, where it anasto- moses with the vessel of the opposite side. Surgery.—The lingual artery can be most conveniently tied in the triangle formed by the two bellies of the digastric and the hypo- glossal nerve, by dividing the fibres of the hyo-glossus horizontally near the hyoid bone. A curved incision from the symphysis menti to near the angle of the jaw, reaching to the level of the hyoid bone, will expose the lower border of the submaxillary gland, which must be drawn upwards so as to expose the digastric muscle.

The author has on two occasions tied the lingual artery without difficulty by this method, which is much more satisfactory than attempting to find the vessel opposite the great cornu of the hyoid bone, to which its relation is imcertain. The Lingual Vein has brandies corresponding to those of the artery, and passes beneath the hyo-glossus to open into the internal jugular vein. Not unfrequently, however, a large vein lies super- ficially to the hyo-glossus, in addition to a smaller vein accompanying the artery. The Genio-hyoid muscle (Fig. 200, 6) arises from the lower of the two genial (or mental) tubercles close to the symphysis menti, and passes downwards immediately beneath the mylo-liyoid and close to the median line, to be inserted into the body of the hyoid bone. The Genio-hyo-glossus muscle (Fig. 200, 4) arises from the upper of the genial tubercles, and is triangular or fan-shaped, being inserted close to the median line all along the under surface of the tongue, and to the body of the hyoid bone above the genio- hyoid. The genio-hyoid and genio-hyo-glossus are elevators of the hyoid bone or depressors of the jaw, as they alternately take their fixed point above or below. The genio-hyo-glossus has an important action on the tongue, the posterior and middle fibres drawing up the hyoid bone and thrusting the tongue out of the mouth (and to the opposite side if acting singly), and the anterior fibres drawing the tongue into the mouth again, being assisted by the stylo-glossus. Both the genio-hyoid and the genio-hyo-glossus are supplied by the 9th nerve. The Stylo-maxillary Ligament (Fig. 194, 6) will be seen attached to the angle of the jaw, which is turned up. It is a process of deep cervical fascia attached to the apex of the styloid process (where it gives origin to fibres of the stylo-glossus), and inserted into the inner surface of the angle of the jaw, where it is much widened. It intervenes between the parotid and submaxillary glands. The Stylo-hyoid Ligament is a narrow band passing from the styloid process to the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone, where it gives origin to fibres of the middle constrictor. It is frequently ossified to a considerable extent. The Inferior Palatine and Tonsillitic branches of the facialDEEP DISSECTION OF NECK. 376 artery can be seen ascending, the former between the stylo-glnssus and stylo-pharyngeus muscles, and the latter either with it or between the stylo-glossus and pterygoideus interims, to the outside of the pharynx, where they lie upon the superior constrictor. They will be more fully seen in the dissection of the pharynx. The Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve (Fig. 198, n) (8th) is seen emerging from between the jugular vein and internal carotid artery, and winding round the stylo-pharyngeus muscle ; if the stylo- glossus be now divided, the nerve may be followed beneath that muscle to the base of the tongue, where it supplies the papillce circumvallatcc. It gives branches to the stylo-pharyngeus and to the pharynx in this part of its course, and will be again seen in another dissection. Deep Dissection op the Side of the Neck. On one side only of the subject it will be useful to make a deep dissection, bringing into view, from the side, parts which will be afterwards seen from behind in the dissection of the pharynx. [Divide the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw and cut through the inferior dental and lingual nerves and reflect them carefully upwards. The branch to the internal pterygoid muscle from the deep surface of the inferior maxillary nerve can now be traced to the posterior border of the muscle, and in close connec- tion with it may possibly be found a small pink body, the otic ganglion.] The Otic Ganglion (Fig. 201) is a minute body which receives its motor root from the internal pterygoid nerve of the inferior maxillary division of the fifth. Its sensory root may be traced from the auriculo-temporal nerve, where it embraces the middle meningeal artery, and a second sensory root is derived from the tympanic branch of the glosso-pharyngeal (Jacobson’s nerve) through the small super- ficial petrosal nerve of Arnold, connected with the facial trunk. The sympathetic root also enters the ganglion behind, coming from. that upon the middle meningeal artery. A branch passes from the ganglion forwards and downwards to the tensor palati muscle, and another backwards to the tensor tympani. [The internal pterygoid muscle is to be cut through and removed from its attachment to the inner surface of the external pterygoid plate. The tensor' palati lying upon the internal pterygoid plate will now be exposed, and posterior to it the superior constrictorTHE SUPERIOR CONSTRICTOR. 377 of the pharynx with the ascending pharyngeal artery lying upon it.] The Ascending Pharyngeal Artery (Fig. 203, 9) can now he traced from the external carotid artery near its origin, and lies between the internal carotid and the pharynx. It gives branches to the prever- tebral muscles, anastomosing with the ascending cervical artery, and near the base of the skull divides into pharyngeal and meningeal branches. The meningeal branches are very small and enter the skull by the foramen lacerum medium and the foramen jugulare, to supply the dura mater. The pharyngeal branches supply the pharynx, and turn over the upper border of the superior constrictor to supply the palate. A palatine branch also accompanies the tendon of the tensor palati muscle. The Tensor Palati (Fig. 207, 6) is now seen in part, and will be more fully exposed by cutting away the external pterygoid plate with bone-forceps. Its vertical fibres covering the internal pterygoid plate arise from the scaphoid fossa at the root of the internal plate, and slightly from the under surface of the wing of the sphenoid and the outer surface of the Eustachian tube. The tendon winds round the hamular process to its insertion into the palate ; but this is obscured at present by the attachment of the fibres of the superior constrictor to the internal pterygoid plate. The Superior Constrictor of the Pharynx (Fig. 201, 1) is now seen arising from the lower third of the internal pterygoid plate, and from the hamular process of the sphenoid bone ; from the pterygo- maxillary ligament opposite the attachment of the buccinator ; from the inner surface of the lower jaw above the posterior extremity of the mylo-liyoid ridge, and slightly from the side of the tongue. The fibres curve backwards, leaving an interval between the muscle and the base of the skull in which the fibrous bag of the pharynx is visible, to be inserted in the median raplie. [In order to complete a side-view of the Internal Carotid, Jugular Vein, and Eighth nerve it will be necessary to remove the remains of the digastric and stylo-liyoid muscles, and the external carotid artery, cutting it above the origin of the ascending pharyngeal branch. The stylo-glossus, which has been already dissected, will now be thoroughly exposed and should be carefully removed, when the Glosso-pharyngeal nerve lying upon the stylo-pharyngeus will be seen].378 DEEP DISSECTION OF NECK. The Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve (Fig. 201, 2) leaves the jugular foramen in front of the pneumo-gastric, and arches forward over the internal carotid artery to the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, against which it lies. Opposite the base of the tongue it turns forward across the stylo-pharyngeus beneath the stylo-glossus, and has been traced to Fig. 201. the base of the tongue of which it is the special nerve (p. 376). The connections and branches of the nerve will be subsequently dissected. The Stylo-pharyngeus Muscle (Fig. 201, 3) is now fully ex- posed in its upper part. It arises from the inner surface of the root of the styloid process of the temporal bone, and passing obliquely forwards and downwards with the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, between Fig. 201.—The deep vessels and nerves of the base of the skull (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

The Stylo-hyoid Ligament lies between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscles, and gives origin to some fibres of the middle constrictor of the pharynx. It is attached above to the tip of the styloid process, and below to the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone. [The styloid process is to be cut through at its base and turned aside with the stylo-pharyngeus, when the careful removal- of a process of fascia will expose the internal carotid, the jugular vein, and the eighth pair up to the base of the skull; with the loop between the first and second cervical nerves, and the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic.] The Internal Carotid Artery (Fig. 201) commences at the point of bifurcation of the common carotid, usually opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. It is at first to the outer side of the external carotid, and, like it, is covered ly the sterno-mastoid and platysma muscles, and crossed by the hypoglossal nerve with the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles. It then lies behind the ex- ternal carotid, and is crossed by the styloid process and the stylo- pharyngeus muscle, with the glosso-pharyngeal nerve and pharyn- geal branch of the vagus. Posteriorly it rests against the sympathetic trunk and the rectus capitis anticus major, and is crossed by the superior laryngeal branch of the pneumo-gastric. The pneuino- gastric nerve and internal jugular vein lie to its outer side in the whole of its course, and to the inner side is the pharynx with the ascending pharyngeal artery. The artery enters the carotid canal of the temporal bone, in which it will be subsequently traced. The Internal Jugular Vein (Fig. 201) commences outside the skull by the junction of the lateral with the inferior petrosal sinus, and lies to the outer side of the internal and common carotids in the neck, with the eighth and ninth nerves intervening, and in front of the rectus capitis lateralis. It receives no branch above the hyoid bone, but below that level it receives the superior thyroid, lingual, facial, occipital, pharyngeal and middle thyroid veins, and joins the subclavian vein to form the innominate or bracliio-cephalic vein (p. 335). The Pneumo-gastric Nerve or Vagus (Fig. 201, 4) leaves the skull at the foramen jugidare in front of the vein, and in the same sheath as the spinal-accessory nerve. It follows the carotid artery,DEEP DISSECTION OF NECK. 380 Ivin" between it and the jugular vein, and close to the skull is joined by the accessory portion of the spinal-accessory nerve, and expands to form the ganglion of the trunk, from which the two following branches can now be traced. The pharyngeal branch (Fig. 180, 3,) receives a branch from the spinal-accessory nerve and then passes in front of (or behind) the internal carotid artery to the pharynx, where it joins the pharyngeal plexus (p. 388). The superior laryngeal nerve (Fig. 180, 9) takes an oblique course behind the internal carotid to the thyro-liyoid membrane. The cranial branches of the pneumo-gastric will be subsequently described (p. 386). The Spinal-accessory Nerve (Fig. 201, 10) leaves the jugular foramen in the sheath of the pneumo-gastric nerve, with which it has communicating branches. It gives branches, by means of the accessory part which joins the vagus in the jugular foramen, to join the pharyngeal and superior laryngeal branches of the vagus. The principal or spinal part' passes over or under the internal jugular vein, and pierces the sterno-mastoid muscle to end in the trapezius. The Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 201, 6) emerging at the anterior condyloid foramen, comes forward between the pneumo-gastric and spinal-accessory nerves, and crosses the external carotid artery. It has branches of communication with the pneumo-gastric and sym- pathetic, and also with the first spinal nerve. Its distribution to the muscles of the tongue has been already seen (p. 372). The Rectus Capitis Lateralis (Fig. 202, 8) is now seen from the side between the jugular vein and the vertebral artery. It arises from the upper surface of the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the under surface of the jugular process of the occipital bone. [By carefully removing the rectus lateralis, the small anterior branch of the first cervical nerve may be found upon the anterior arch of the atlas, forming a loop with the second nerve.] The First Cervical Nerve (sub-occipital nerve) (Fig. 201) has a small anterior division, which leaves the posterior division on the posterior arch of the atlas. It runs forward beneath the vertebral artery, and lies on the anterior arch to the inner side of the rectus lateralis, which it supplies, giving also branches to the pneumo-gastric and ninth nerves, and the superior ganglion of the sympathetic. In front of the vertebrre the first nerve forms a loop with the second cervical nerve, which is much larger. The Superior Cervical Ganglion (Fig. 201, 8) of the sym-381 THE SCALENE MUSCLES. pathetic can now he seen, and has been already described (p. 343). It will be much more satisfactorily examined later on, from behind. Prevertebral Region. [The carotid arteries, with the jugular veins and the pneumo-gastric and sympathetic nerves, are to be divided at the level of the top of the sternum, and the trachea with the oesophagus is to be severed a little lower down. The neck is then to be bent forcibly backward so as to make the cut surface of the skull rest upon the table, and the oesophagus and trachea with the vessels and nerves being drawn forcibly forward, the cellular tissue between the pharynx and the front of the vertebral column is to be cautiously dissected through, until the under surface of the base of the skull is exposed. The saw is now to be applied close behind the mastoid process, and an oblique cut made, which is to be carried through the whole thickness of the temporal bone into the jugular foramen, and prolonged through th% remaining portion of the parietal bone to the cut which was made in removing the brain. A similar cut having been made on the oppo- site side, a broad chisel is to be applied to the basilar process of the occipital bone where it is exposed behind the pharynx, and it is to be divided. The chisel being again applied on each side of the middle line will unite this cut with those made by the saw, and the prepara- tion will then be divided into two parts ; the anterior part of the skull with the pharynx and deep vessels and nerves is to be wrapped up for subsequent examination, and the muscles attached to the vertebral column with the posterior part of the skull are now to be examined.] The Scalene muscles have been seen already in part, but can now be fully dissected. The Scalenus Anticus (Fig. 202, 2) arises from the tubercle on the inner border and upper surface of the first rib (scalene tubercle), and ascends to be inserted into the anterior tubercles on the trans- verse processes of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical vertebrae. The phrenic nerve will probably still be found on the anterior surface of the muscle, and behind it the brachial nerves emerge and the sub- clavian artery passes. The Scalenus Medius (Fig. 202, 7) lies behind the brachial nerves, arising from the rough marking upon the upper surface of the first rib behind the groove for the subclavian artery. It ascends to be inserted into the posterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the lower six* cervical vertebrae. The Scalenus Posticus (Fig. 202), which is the smallest of the three muscles, arises from a rough mark on the outer surface of the382 THE PREVERTEBRAL REGION. Fig. 202. second rib, posterior to the attachment of the serratus magnus ; and is inserted into the posterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the lowest three cervical vertebra. The Rectus Capitis Anticus Major (Fig. 202, i) arises from the anterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical vertebra! (thus corresponding to the insertion of the scalenus anticus), and is in- serted into the under surface of the basilar process of the occipital bone close to the median line. The in- sertions of this and the following muscles are very generally damaged by the division of the base of the skull. The Rectus Capitis Anticus Minor (Fig. 202, 4) is beneath the preceding muscle, which must be turned aside to show it. It arises from the front of the lateral mass of the atlas, and partly from its transverse process, and ascends obliquely inwards to be inserted into the under surface of the basilar process of the occipital bone, posterior to and further from the median line than the rectus major. The Rectus Capitis Lateralis (Fig. 202, 8) is now exposed, although not a prevertebral muscle. It arises from the upper surface of the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the under surface of the jugular process of the occipital bone. It separates the internal jugular vein from the vertebral artery. The Longus Colli (Fig. 202) lies on the front of the cervical vertebra, and is most conveniently divided into three portions, two oblique and one vertical.

The inferior oblique ■portion (3) arises from the bodies of the 1st and 2nd dorsal vertebras, and passes obliquely upward to be inserted into the transverse processes of the 5th and 6tlr cervical vertebrae. The superior oblique portion (5) arises from the anterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th cervical vertebra;, and passes upward and outward to be inserted into the anterior tubercle of the atlas. The vertical portion (6) arises from the bodies of the three lower cervical and three upper dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the bodies of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th cervical vertebrae. All the prevertebral muscles draw forward the upper part of the vertebral column or bow the head, when acting symmetrically; or when the muscle of one side acts alone, it draws the spine to that side. The scalene muscles, when the vertebrae are fixed, act upon the ribs and raise them, thus being ordinary muscles of inspiration. The scaleni and longus colli are supplied by branches derived from the nerves of the brachial plexus, close to the intervertebral foramina. The recti antici are supplied by the anterior branches of the first and second cervical, and the rectus lateralis by the anterior branch of the first cervical nerve. The small Intertransverse muscles may be seen between the trans- verse processes. The anterior ones pass between the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes, and the posterior ones have been already seen in the dissection of the back. Between them the anterior divisions of the cervical nerves appear. The Vertebral Artery will be seen between the scalenus anticus and the longus colli muscles, and may be more conveniently traced through the foramina in the transverse processes now than at an earlier period (v. p. 337). Dissection op the Pharynx. Before dissecting the anterior half of the skull with the pharynx, the dissector should examine the fauces and upper part of the pharynx from the mouth. The soft palate with the uvula in the median line will be readily recognised, and passing from the soft palate on each side will be seen the two pillars of the fauces with the tonsil between them. The anterior pillar extends from the soft palate to the tongue, being vertical in direction, and formed by the palato-glossus muscle. The posterior pillar passes obliquely backwards, and is lost in the pharynx, being formed by the palato-pharyngeus muscle. The tonsil384 THE PHARYNX. is generally much shrunken in a subject which has arrived at this stage of dissection. [The pharynx and upper part of the cesopliagus are to he carefully distended with cotton wool or tow, and the preparation being placed with the face downwards, is to be secured over a small block with hooks, one set of which should draw the oesophagus down and keep the pharynx tense. The vessels and nerves at the back of the pharynx are to be examined before the muscular bag itself is dissected.] The vessels and nerves now to be examined have all been seen in part in previous dissections, and then from either the front or the side. They are now all seen from behind, and this must be borne in mind thoroughly, or it will lead to misconception of the description. The section of the base of the skull is seldom precisely similar on the two sides, and it will generally be found advisable therefore to trace the parts first brought into view on one side, and the carotid artery, etc., on the other, as in the illustration (Fig. 203). The Sympathetic Nerve (Fig. 203) with its superior and middle cervical ganglia is at once exposed, and some of its branches may be very conveniently traced. The Superior cervical ganglion (12) is fusiform, and nearly an inch in length. It lies behind the internal carotid artery, and has small branches of communication with the following cranial nerves—the glosso-pliaryngeal, the pneumo-gastric, and the hypoglossal. The branches of communication with the cervical nerves have been already seen (p. 343). The branches of distribution are, (1) the nervi molles, distributed upon the external carotid artery and its branches ; (2) the pharyngeal branch, which can now be traced to the pharynx, where it enters into the formation of the pharyngeal plexus ; (3) the laryngeal branch to the superior laryngeal nerve; (4) the superior cardiac nerve, which has been already seen. The Middle cervical ganglion (18) is of small size, and gives off (1) thyroid branches upon the inferior thyroid artery, and (2) the middle cardiac nerve (Fig. 181). The Ninth or Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 203, 10) is necessarily cut off at the anterior condyloid foramen in making the dissection, and should therefore be traced from below, where it will be found in relation with the occipital artery. The nerve is at first posterior to the internal carotid artery and jugular vein, and then passes between them; and also between the pneumo-gastric and spinal-accessory nerves, with the former of which it has a communication, as well as with the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. A small branch, connected with the ninth nerve at one end and loose at theTHE SPINAL-ACCESSORY NERVE. 385 other, is the communicating branch from the first and second cervical nerves (Fig. 204, 19). The Internal Jugular Vein (Fig. 203, 8) commences outside the skull by the junction of the lateral sinus with the inferior petrosal sinus. Its course in the neck has been already seen, and it should now be divided close to the skvdl and removed. The Spinal-accessory Nerve (Fig. 203, 6) emerges from the foramen jugulare, where it is closely connected with the pneumo- gastric nerve, and may be traced to the deep surface of the sterno- mastoid muscle (Fig. 204, 4).

Two ganglia are found upon the pneumo-gastric nerve, viz., the superior or ganglion of the root, and the inferior or ganglion of the trunk. The ganglion of the root is very small, and is placed in the jugular foramen. It lias minute branches of commu- nication with the glosso- pharyngeal, spinal-accessory, sympathetic, and facial nerves. The communication with the latter is through a minute auricular branch, which enters a hole within the jugular fossa, and passes through the temporal bone to the pinna (Fig. 204, 17). The ganglion of the trunk is nearly an inch long, and of a pink colour, and has branches of communication with the hypoglossal, the sympathetic, and the loop of the first and second cervical nerves. It gives off the following branches :— 1. The pharyngeal branch oj the pneumo-gastric (14), which receives a communicating branch from the spinal-acces- sory nerve, and then passes in front of (or sometimes Fig. 204.—Diagram of the eighth, ninth, and sympathetic nerves (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

The superior laryngeal nerve (16), which takes an oblique course behind the internal carotid to the larynx, where it has been already seen to give off the external laryngeal branch, and then to pierce the thyro-hyoid membrane (Fig. 204, 22). The Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve (Fig. 203, 2) lies in a little special notch in the lower border of the petrous bone as it leaves the jugular foramen, being thus isolated from the remainder of the eighth nerve. It then passes forward over the internal carotid artery, and reaches the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, at the lower border of which it has already been seen in the submaxillary region, and has been traced to the tongue (p. 376). It presents two small ganglia, one at the upper part of the foramen, the superior or jugular ganglion, which is of very small size, and the other at the lower part of the foramen, which is larger, and is called the inferior or petrous ganglion or ganglion of Andersch (Fig. 204, 2). The upper ganglion involves only some of the fibres of the nerve, but they all pass through the lower ganglion. The lower ganglion has branches of communication with the pneumo-gas trie nerve, one going to its superior ganglion, and another to the auricular nerve ; also with the superior ganglion of the sym- pathetic ; and with the facial nerve by a branch which pierces the posterior belly of the digastric (Fig. 204, 25). The glosso-pharyngeal nerve gives off the following branches in its course to the tongue :— 1. Carotid branches, which join the sympathetic plexus on that vessel, and communicate with the pharyngeal branch of the pneumo-gastric. 2. Muscular branches to the stylo-pharyngeus. 6. Superior cervical ganglion of sympathetic. 7. Loop between 1st and 2nd cervical nerves. 8. Carotid branch of sympathetic. 9. Tympanic nerve (Jacobson). 10. Its branch to carotid plexus. 11. Its branch to Eustachian tube. 12. Its branch to fenestra ovalis. 13. Its branch to fenestra rotunda. 14. Its union with small superficial petrosal nerve. 15. Its union with large superficial petrosal nerve. 16. Otic ganglion. 17. Auricular nerve of pneumo-gastric. 18. Junction of pneumo-gastric with spinal accessory. 19.

Pharyngeal branches, •which assist in forming the pharyngeal plexus. 4. Tonsillitic branches to the tonsils ancl the soft palate. 5. Lingual branches. [By cautiously cutting away the temporal bone with the bone- forceps, the dissector may, in a favourable subject, see some of the branches of Jacobson’s nerve.] The Typipanic branch of the glosso-pharyngecil nerve (Jacobson’s nerve) (Fig. 204, 9) arises from the petrous ganglion, and enters an aperture in the ridge of bone between the carotid foramen and the jugular fossa. It pierces the floor of the tympanum and grooves the promontory on its inner wall, giving branches to the fenestra ovalis (12), the fenestra rotunda (13), and the lining membrane of the tym- panum and Eustachian tube (11). The communicating branches of Jacobson’s nerve are three in number; one joining the carotid plexus in the carotid canal (10); the second joining the great superficial petrosal nerve (15); and the third running through the temporal bone to end in the otic ganglion as the small superficial petrosal nerve of Arnold (14). (,See also Fig. 212.) Opportunity may be taken at this point to examine the ossicles of the tympanum (p. 407). The Pharyngeal Plexus (Figs. 203 and 204) is to be found upon the middle and inferior constrictors of the pharynx, both of which it supplies. The branches forming the plexus are derived from the nerves which have been examined, viz., the glosso-pharyn- geal, the pneumo-gastric (pharyngeal and superior laryngeal branches), and the sympathetic. [In all probability the carotid canal in the temporal bone will have been opened on one side in making the section of the skull, but if not, this may now be done with the bone-forceps.] The Internal Carotid Artery (Fig. 203) has been already seen from the front in the dissection of the neck, and is now seen from behind. It ascends by the side of the pharynx, being separated from it, however, by the ascending pharyngeal branch of the external carotid artery. Behind the artery is the trunk of the sympathetic, and crossing its posterior aspect is the superior laryngeal nerve of the pneumo-gastric. In front of it is the styloid process with the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve; and to the outer side the pneumo-gastric nerve with the jugular vein. The danger of the close proximity of the carotid to the pharynx has been389 THE CONSTKICTOK MUSCLES. exaggerated, since (as will be afterwards seen) any ordinary incision may be made in the tonsils or back of the pharynx without any risk of injuring the vessel, which lies quite to the side. The carotid takes a tortuous course in the temporal bone and cranium, making two sigmoid turns, one, the longer, in the petrous bone, and the other by the side of the sella turcica. In this part of its course it is more or less surrounded by a plexus of nerves derived principally from the sympathetic. The Ascending Pharyngeal Artery (Fig. 203, 9) is one of the ascending branches of the external carotid artery. It arises near the bifurcation of the common carotid, and ascends by the side of the pharynx, and to the inner side of the internal carotid artery, to the base of the skull. It gives branches to the prevertebral muscles, anastomosing with the ascending cervical artery, and divides into meningeal and pharyngeal branches. The meningeal branches are very small, and enter the skull by the foramen lacerum medium and the foramen jugulare, to supply the dura mater. The pharyngeal branches supply the pharynx, and turn over the upper border of the superior constrictor to supply the palate; they anastomose with the inferior palatine branch of the facial artery. The ascending pharyngeal vein opens into the internal jugular. [The constrictor muscles of the pharynx are to be cleaned in the direction of their fibres, beginning at the lower border of the inferior constrictor. In order to see the origin of the superior constrictor, it will be necessary to remove the internal pterygoid on one side. The pharyngeal plexus must necessarily be destroyed in the course of the dissection, but the superior and inferior laryngeal, and the glosso- pharyngeal nerves are to be preserved.] The Inferior Constrictor (Fig. 205, 9) is the most superficial of the three muscles of the pharynx, the upper oblique border over- lapping the middle constrictor, and the lower straight border being continuous with the oesophagus. It arises from the side of the cricoid cartilage in front of the articular facet, and from the ala of the thyroid cartilage behind the oblique line. All the fibres are inserted into the median raphe. The recurrent laryngeal nerve passes beneath the lower border of the inferior constrictor, and the superior laryngeal nerve and artery intervene between it and the middle constrictor. The Middle Constrictor (Fig. 205, 10) is a fan-shaped muscle, which with its fellow of the opposite side forms a trapezium in the median line. It arises from the upper surface of the great cornu of the hyoid bone, from the lesser cornu, and from the stylo-hyoid liga-390 THE PHARYNX. ment; and its fibres ascend and descend obliquely to be inserted into the median raphe of the pharynx. The middle constrictor is overlapped by the inferior constrictor, and itself covers the superior constrictor in part. It is separated from the inferior constrictor by the superior laryngeal nerve and vessels, and from the superior constrictor by the stylo-pharyngeus muscle and glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The Superior Constrictor (Fig. 205, 11) arises from the lower third of the internal pterygoid plate and from the hamular process of the sphenoid bone ; from the pterygo- maxillary ligament opposite the at- tachment of the buccinator ; from the inner surface of the lower jaw above the posterior extremity of the mylo-hyoid ridge, and slightly from the side of the tongue. The fibres curve backwards, leaving an interval between the muscle and the base of the skull in which the fibrous bag of the pharynx is visible, and are inserted into the median raphe, being overlapped at the lower part by the middle constrictor. Dis- tinct tendinous fibres may occasionally be traced to the tubercle on the under surface of the basilar process, to which the fibrous bag of the pharynx is attached. The superior constrictor is separated from the middle constrictor by the stylo-pharyngeus muscle and glosso- pharyngeal nerve. Above its upper curved border the ascending- pharyngeal artery sends a branch to the palate, together with a branch of the inferior palatine artery, and the levator palati muscle and the Eustachian tube cross obliquely inwards beneath the fibrous bag.

Mylo-hyoid.INTERIOR OF THE PHARYNX. 391 The three constrictors are supplied by the pharyngeal plexus of nerves; the superior has also branches from the glosso-pharyngeal, and the inferior from the external and recurrent laryngeal nerves. The Stylo-Pharyngeus Muscle (Fig. 205, 12) has already been seen at its origin, and can now be followed to its insertion by dividing some of the fibres of the middle constrictor. It arises from the root of the styloid process of the temporal bone, and passes between the superior and middle constrictors to be inserted into the bag of the pharynx, and into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. It is supplied by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The Fibrous bag of the Pharynx is very thin at the lower part, where it lies between the muscular fibres and the mucous membrane, but above the border of the superior constrictor it is much stronger, and is expanded from side to side, covering in the Eustachian tubes and the levatores palati muscles. At the base of the skull it is attached to the basilar process of the occipital bone, by a fibrous band (cranio- pharyngeal ligament, Quain), to the Eustachian tube, and to the under surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone ; and is carried forwards to the root of the pterygoid process and the internal ptery- goid plate of the sphenoid bone, becoming continuous with the pterygo- maxillary ligament. [The pharynx is to be opened from behind by an incision in the median line, from the basilar process to the commencement of the oesophagus. The fibrous bag is to be detached from the occipital bone on each side and held widely open with hooks, and the whole of the eotton wool is to be removed from the interior of the pharynx.] The Interior of the Pharynx (Fig. 206) presents seven openings in the following order from above downwards ; (1 and 2) the two posterior nares separated by the vomer; (3 and 4) the two Eusta- chian tubes ; (5) the isthmus faucium or opening of the mouth ; (6) the superior aperture of the larynx guarded by the epiglottis; and (7) the opening into the oesophagus. Tae soft palate or velum pendulum palati (5) intervenes between the nose and the mouth, and consists of a fibrous membrane which is attached to the palate bones, and is strengthened by expansions from the several muscles of the palate ; it is covered by mucous mem- brane, wluch is ciliated on the upper but not on the lower surface. The centre of its free border is prolonged into the uvula, and on each side will be seen the two folds called the pillars of the fauces, formed by mucous membrane reflected upon the palato-glossi and palato- pharyngei muscles. The mucous membrane of the pharynx is continuous with both392 THE PHARYNX. that of the nose and of the mouth, and its epithelium varies in different situations, being squamous throughout the canal below the level of the palate, but columnar and ciliated above that point. Close to the base of the skull is a collection of follicular glands, extending from one Eustachian tube to the other, and forming the 'pharyngeal tonsils of Kolliker. These are hypertrophied in cases of congenital cleft-palate, when they can be readily seen, and appear to assist in closing the aperture between the nose and mouth during deglutition. This is the best opportunity for study- ing the Process of Deglutition. The food having been duly masticated and insalivated, the mouth is closed in order that the lower jaw may afford a fixed point from which the muscles of the tongue may act. The bolus of food is then carried back to the fauces by the movement of the tongue, and is there grasped by the pillars of the fauces and prevented from returning. The pharynx is now raised by the stylo-pharyngei muscles and is at the same time widened to receive the food, which is prevented from ascending into the nares by the raising and tension of the soft palate, due to the action of the levator and circumflexus palati of both sides, and by the approximation of the posterior pillars by means of the contraction of the palato-pharyngei. The constrictors, by their successive contraction from above downwards, next force the food towards the oesophagus. At the same moment the larynx is raised by the action of the eleva- tors of the liyoid bone, and the aperture of the larynx is compressed against the epiglottis and base of the tongue; by which means the food is prevented from entering the windpipe. An additional security is provided by the epiglottis, which when healthy is folded down over Fig. 206. Fig. 206.—Pharynx laid open from behind (from Wilson). 1. Section of base of skull. 2. 2.

Lastly the contraction of the oesophagus carries the food down to the stomach. The Palate. [The soft palate is to be stretched by inserting a hook into the ■uvula, and the mucous membrane is to be removed from the upper surface of the palate and the neighbouring bones, so as to expose the muscles above the palate and the Eustachian tube. The levator palati will be found passing obliquely inwards, the azygos uvulae in the median line of the palate, and the tensor palati can be best seen by dividing the levator and detaching the fibres of the superior con- strictor from the hamular process, when the muscle will be found upon the internal pterygoid plate.] The Soft Palate (velum pendulum palati) is a mirsculo-membra- nous curtain attached to the posterior border of the hard palate in front, and with a free border behind terminating in the uvula. It consists of an aponeurosis attached to the palate bones, overlaid by expansions from the palatine muscles, and covered on both surfaces with mucous membrane, which on the oral surface presents a tliick layer of mucous glands. From behind forwards the soft palate con- sists of 1. Pharyngeal mucous membrane; 2. Thin attachment of palato-pharyngeus; 3. Azygos uvulae ; 4. Levator palati; 5. Thicker attachment of palato-pharyngeus ; 6. Tendon of tensor palati; 7. Fibrous aponeurosis ; 8. Palato-glossus; 9. Oral mucous membrane with mucous glands. The Azygos Uvulae (Fig. 207, 8) consists of two small muscular slips placed parallel to, and on each side of, the median line. It arises from the posterior nasal spine of the palate bone, and is inserted into the uvula. The Levator Palati (Fig. 207, 5) arises from the under surface of the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and from the under surface of the Eustachian tube. The muscle passes inwards above the border of the superior constrictor muscle, and is inserted into the soft palate by a broad expansion, which meets that of its fellow muscle in the median line. The Circumflexus or Tensor Palati (Fig. 207, 6) arises from the scaphoid fossa at the root of the internal pterygoid plate, and slightly from the under surface of the wing of the sphenoid; also from the outer surface of the Eustachian tube. The tendon descends verti- cally to wind round the hamular process of the sphenoid bone, where394 THE PALATE. it is lubricated by a minute bursa, and then takes a horizontal direc- tion to the soft palate. It is inserted into the palate by an expansion beneatli the levator, and also into the transverse ridge on the under surface of the palate bone. Fig. 207. The levator palati raises the soft palate,and the circumflexus makes it tense on each occasion of swallowing. The azygos uvulaj can have but a slight and unimportant action, viz., that of shortening the uvula. The levator palati and azygos uvulae are supplied by palatine branches from the spheno-palatine (Meckel’s) ganglion; the tensor palati receives a branch from the otic ganglion. Surgery.—The muscles above the palate, and especially the levator palati, are of interest surgically in relation to the operation of staphyloraphy, or that for closure of a congenital fissure of the Fig. 207.—Muscles of the palate (drawn by J.

Sir W: Fergusson showed that the two segments of a fissured soft palate are drawn asunder by the levatores palati on every occa- sion of swallowing, and he therefore proposed and carried out the division of these muscles, by means of a knife having a lancet-shaped blade set at right angles to the handle, which is passed through the fissure. Opportunity is to be taken, before the pillars of the fauces are dissected, to observe the important surgical fact that a bistoury, if made to transfix the tonsil from before backwards, will pass internally to the carotid artery, unless the point of the instrument is directed purposely to one side, in which case only would it be possible to injure this important vessel. The Eustachian Tube (Fig. 207, 2) is the communication be- tween the pharynx and the tympanum or middle ear. The osseous portion of the canal is in the temporal bone, but the cartilaginous portion is now seen to be nearly an inch in length, and to ter- minate in a broad trumpet-shaped end at the posterior extremity of the inferior turbinate bone. The cartilage of which the tube' is formed is triangular in shape and is doubled upon itself, the defi- - ciency at the lower part being completed by fibrous tissue. In the recent condition the thick mucous membrane converts the opening into a mere vertical slit, which is generally closed, but during the j' process of deglutition is opened by the action' of. the circumfiexOk / palati muscle, and thus the equilibr ium of the air in the tymparfum^ is maintained. - . [The palate is to be drawn up so as to put the pillars of the fauces on the stretch as much as possible, and the mucous membrane is to be removed to expose the palato-glossus and palato-pharyngeus muscles.] The Palato-glossus is placed in front of the tonsil, and is very small and indistinct. The muscle arises from the middle line of the soft palate in common with its fellow, and descends to the side of the tongue, where it is inserted, joining the fibres of the stylo-glossus and liyo-glossus muscles. The Palato-pharyngeus (Fig. 207, 9) is larger than the palato- glossus, and is placed behind the tonsil. It arises in the palate by two slips, which are separated by the levator palati and azygos uvular muscles, and the fibres of which meet those of the opposite muscle in the median line. The muscle passes obliquely downwards to the pharynx, to be inserted into the posterior border of the thyroid carti- lage with the stylo-pharyngeus, and to be lost in the wall of the pharynx itself.THE PALATE. 396 The palatoglossus muscle is a constrictor of the fauces, and grasps the bolus of food when it has passed out of the mouth, thus prevent- ing its return. The palato-pharyngeus raises the pharynx, hut its most important action is to approximate the posterior pillars of the fauces, which with the uvula then make an inclined plane along which the holus passes into the grasp of the constrictors. Both the palato-glossus and the palato-pharyngeus are supplied by branches from Meckel’s ganglion. The Amygdala or Tonsil is placed between the palato-glossus and palato-pharyngeus muscles, and is usually much shrunken after death. It consists of lymphoid tissue with a number of mucous follicles, the orifices of which may be seen on the internal surface. The outside of the tonsil is in close relation with the superior constrictor of the pharynx and with the ascending pharyngeal artery. It is to be noticed that it is anatomically impossible for any enlargement of the tonsil to obstruct the Eustachian tube, and thus produce deafness. [The tongue and the larynx are to be detached by dividing all the structures between them and the palate, and are to be carefully pre- served for subsequent examination. By inverting the skull the hard palate will then be brought into view.] The Hard Palate (Fig. 209, 7) is continuous with the soft palate, but its mucous membrane is much more dense, being inseparably united in great part with the periosteum of the maxillary and palate bones. The mucous membrane presents a median ridge indicative of the foetal division of the parts, and is thrown into more or less trans- verse folds near the anterior part, where it is prolonged on to the gums. Numerous mucous glands lie immediately beneath the mucous membrane and open upon its surface. The Gums (Fig. 208) are composed of dense fibrous tissue insepar- ably united with the periosteum of the alveolus, and covered by the mucous membrane of the mouth, which is prolonged into the sockets of the teeth, where it becomes continuous with the periodontal mem- brane covering them. The Teeth. (Fig. 208) of the upper jaw are 16 in number, viz., 4 incisors, 2 canines, 4 bicuspids, and 6 molars, the most posterior molars being the dentes sapientice or wisdom teeth. Each tooth consists of a croAvn, a neck, and a fang, and upon extracting a molar tooth it will be found to have three fangs, two being on the outer (buccal) and one on the inner (palatine) side. The teeth of the lower jaw correspond in number to those of the upper jaw, but have been necessarily interfered with in the progress397 THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. of tlie dissection. The lower molar teeth differ from those of the upper jaw in presenting only two fangs. The Lips (Fig. 208) are formed externally by skin, and internally by mucous membrane, which is reflected on to them from the gums ; Fig. 208. and between the two are the fibres of the orbicularis oris, with some cellular tissue and mucous glands and the coronary arteries. The fold of mucous membrane connecting each lip with the alveolus in the median line is called the frcenum labii, and is more prominent in the upper than in the lower lip. The Superior Maxillary Nerve. [The skull being placed with the base downwards, a cut with the chisel is to be carried in a straight line from the sphenoidal fissure to the foramen ovale. The side of the skull is then to be sawn through at right angles to the first incision, meeting it at the foramen ovale. The saw being then placed obliquely on the malar bone so Fig. 208.—Dissection of the superior maxillary nerve and Meckel’s ganglion (from Hirsehfeld and Leveille). 1. Superior maxillary nerve. 2.

The piece of bone will now be detached and may be removed, and with the bone-forceps any remaining bone is then to be taken away, so as to expose the whole extent of the superior maxillary nerve.] The Superior Maxillary Nerve (Fig. 208, i) (second division of the 5th) leaves the cranium at the foramen rotundum, and, having crossed the splreno-maxillary fossa, enters the infra-orbital canal and appears on the face at the infra-orbital foramen. It gives off the following branches:— 1. Orbital branch (temporo-malar) (4) which enters the orbit by the spheno-inaxillary fissure,and divides into two branches(malarand tem- poral), which have been seen in the dissection of the face and scalp. 2. Upheno-pcdatine branches (6) which descend to Meckel’s ganglion placed opposite the spheno-palatine foramen, and will be afterwards dissected. 3. Posterior dental branches (2) which supply the gums, and enter the canals on the posterior aspect of the upper jaw, to supply the molar and bicuspid teeth and to communicate with the anterior dental nerve. 4. Anterior dental branch (5) which arises from the nerve in the infra- orbital canal, arc! can only be seen by laying the canal open. It descends in a special canal in the wall of the antrum to the incisor and canine teeth, and has a communication with the posterior dental nerve. The branches of the dental nerves can only be traced to the teeth by removing the outer plate of the alveolus, but the expenditure of time and trouble necessary for this will not be repaid by the results. The facial branches of the superior maxillary nerve have been seen in the dissection of the face (p. 356). The Infra-orbital Artery accompanies the superior maxillary nerve. It is the terminal branch of the internal maxillary artery, and gives a branch to the orbit, and an anterior dented branch which accompanies the anterior dental nerve to the teeth. The infra-orbital vein communicates with the facial vein, and ends in the internal maxillary vein. The Cavity oe the Nose. [In making a section of the nasal cavities it will be found to be almost impossible to preserve the septum and the turbinate bones of both sides uninjured, and the better plan therefore is to preserve the septum carefully at the expense of the turbinate bones of one side, and afterwards to remove it so as to obtain a good view of theTHE CAVITY OF THE NOSE. 399 turbinate bones and meatuses of the nose on the opposite side. The saw being placed on one side of the septum and parallel to it, is to be carried through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and the palatine processes of tire maxillary and palate bones; and the soft palate having been split in the middle line, the skull will be divided into two portions, one of which can be used for the examination of the nose, and the other for the dissection of Meckel’s ganglion, etc.] The Septum Narium (Fig. 210, i) is .a vertical [date, which upon removal of the mucous membrane will be found to be partly bony and partly cartilaginous. The bones entering into its formation are the following :—the crest of the nasal bone, the nasal spine of the frontal bone, the large perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, the vomer, a part of the rostrum of the sphenoid bone, and the crests of the maxillary and palate bones upon which the vomer rests below. The cartilage of the septum is triangular in shape, and lits into the interval between the vertical plate of the ethmoid and the vomer, but it not unfrequently extends backwards for a considerable distance between those bones when they are not so fully developed as usual. The whole septum may be bent considerably to one side as the result of congenital malformation or of violence, and the cartilage may be perforated either congenitally or from disease. The vomer presents an oblique groove for the naso-palatine nerve, which will be afterwards seen upon the opposite side of the bone. [The septum is to be removed piecemeal with the bone-forceps, so as to leave the mucous membrane on the opposite side untouched. The naso-palatine nerve and artery, and some branches of the olfactory nerve at the upper part of the membrane, niay be seen if putrefaction is not too far advanced. The mucous membrane is then to be de- tached below and turned up, when the nasal cavity will be exposed.] The Nasal Fossa (Fig. 209) is a cavity bounded above by a roof which slopes anteriorly and posteriorly, but is horizontal in the middle, being formed anteriorly by the nasal bone and the nasal spine of the frontal bone ; in the middle by the horizontal cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone ; and posteriorly by the under surfaces of the body of the sphenoid bone and of the sphenoidal process of the palate bone. The floor is slightly concave from side to side, and is formed by the palatine processes of the maxillary and palate bones. The inner wall is formed by the septum, which has been examined. The outer wall is divided into three meatuses by the projection from it of the three turbinate bones, of which the two upper are portions of the ethmoid bone, but the lowest is a separate bone articulated upon the orifice of the antrum.THE CAVITY OF THE NOSE. 400 The Superior Meatus (b) is between the superior and middle tur- binate hones, and is the smallest of the three, extending for not more than one-third of the length of the outer wall. The posterior eth- moidal cells and the sphenoidal sinus open into this meatus, and the epheno-palatine foramen is immediately opposite to it. The Middle Meatus (g) is between the middle and inferior turbinate bones, and extends along the posterior two-thirds of the outer wall, curving upward3 anteriorly. The anterior eth- moidal cells, the frontal sinus (through the infundibulum of the ethmoid bone), and the antrum of Highmore open into the meatus. The Inferior Meatus (1c) is between the inferior turbinate bone and the floor of the nasal fossa. It extends the whole length of the fossa, and at the anterior part has the nasal duct opening into it. It should be noticed that the orifice of the Eustachian tube is close to the posterior extremity of the inferior turbinate bone, and that in using the Eustachian catheter, the point of the instrument has there- fore to be raised before it can enter the tube. The Mucous Membrane lining the nasal fossse is termed the pituitary Fig. 209.—The meatuses of the nose on the left side (from Wilson). 1. Frontal bone. 2. Nasal bone. 3.

The upper part of the mucous membrane both on the outer and inner walls of the fossa is peculiar, and has been named the Olfactory Region, from the fact that the branches of the olfactory or first nerve are distributed to it. It is impossible to distinguish this region except Fig. 210. immediately after death, but it comprises the upper and a portion of the middle turbinate hones, and the corresponding portion of the septum.

The remainder of the mucous membrane has columnar and ciliated cells, except at the anterior part corresponding to the cartilaginous portion of the nose, where the epithelium is squamous. The Olfactory Nerve (Fig. 210, a) is the special nerve of smell, and its branches, which are derived from the olfactory bulb, reach the nasal cavity by piercing the cribriform plate of the ethmoid hone. The branches are distributed to the olfactory region, i.e., upon the superior and middle turbinate hones and the upper third of the septum, hut are very difficult to follow, owing to their being destitute of the white substance of Schwann. The nerves of common sensation to the nose are derived from Meckel’s ganglion, and will be afterwards dissected. [With a strong pair of scissors the turbinate bones may be readily cut, so as to expose the several openings into the three meatuses.] The Nasal Duct (ductus ad ncisum) communicates between the lachrymal sac and the inferior meatus of the nose. It grooves the superior maxillary, lachrymal, and inferior turbinate bones, and consists of a fibrous tube lined with mucous membrane having a ciliated epithelium. The nasal branch of the fifth nerve (ophthalmic division) (Fig. 210, d) may be found in a groove on the under surface of the nasal bone in its passage from the orbit to the face, and gives a branch to the septum (pp. 320 and 356). Dissection of Meckel’s Ganglion, etc. Before beginning this dissection, the student should ascertain the position of the spheno-palatine foramen (Fig. 209,«), opposite to which the spheno-palatine ganglion is placed, and through which the internal maxillary artery enters the nose. This will be found on either half of the skull immediately behind the superior meatus of the nose. [The mucous membrane lining the vertical plate of the palate bone is to be removed, and the thin plate of bone chiseled through immediately below the spheno-palatine foramen, when the palatine nerves and arteries will be exposed enclosed in a tube of membrane. By dissecting the mucous membrane from the hard palate the termi- nation of these nerves can be traced. An attempt may be made by working carefully with the bone-forceps and chisel to open up the Vidian canal in the root of the pterygoid process, in order to expose the Vidian nerve and artery, but the proceeding is very difficult, and seldom satisfactory in its results.]403 meckel’s ganglion. The Spheno-palatine, or Meckel’s Ganglion (Fig. 211, i) is a minute red body situated opposite the spheno-palatine foramen, which is connected with the superior maxillary nerve by one or two branches (p. 398); with the facial nerve by the Vidian nerve ; and with the sympathetic upon the internal carotid artery by a branch which joins the Vidian nerve (Fig. 208). Fig. 211. lis The Branches (Fig. 211) of the ganglion are ascending, descending, internal, and posterior. 1. The ascending branches are two or three of very small size, which pass to the periosteum of the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure. 2. The descending branches go to the palate, and are three in number:— Fig. 211.—Meckel’s ganglion and its branches (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Spheno-palatine ganglion (Meckel). 2.

The anterior or great 'palatine nerve (14) descends through the posterior palatine canal to the hard palate, where it forms a junction with the naso-palatine nerve passing through the anterior palatine canal (Fig. 210, g). "Whilst in the canal the nerve gives off inferior nasal branches to the inferior turbinate hone. The middle or external palatine nerve (16) is very small, and descends to the soft palate and tonsil. The posterior or small palatine nerve (17) descends through a small canal behind the great nerve, and is distributed to the soft palate and uvula, supplying the levator palati and the azygos uvulra muscles, i.e. the two elevators of the palate (v. otic ganglion). 3. The internal branches pass through the spheno-palatine foramen to the nose, and are the superior nasal and the naso-palatine nerves. The superior nasal branches (4) supply the mucous membrane of the upper and middle turbinate bones. The naso-palatine nerve (8) crosses the nasal fossa to the septum, along which it passes through a groove in the vomer to the anterior palatine canal. In the canal the left nerve lies in front of the naso- palatine arteries and the right behind them, and both descend to the front of the hard palate to unite with the great palatine nerve. (Fig. 210, e.) 4. The posterior branches are the Vidian and the pterygo-palatine nerves. The Vidian nerve (3) runs through the Vidian canal in the pterygoid process, and divides into superficial petrosal and carotid branches. The superficial petrosal branch (7) pierces the cartilage which fills up the foramen lacerum medium basis cranii, and runs in a groove on the surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone to the hiatus Fallopii, through which it passes to join the facial nerve. The carotid branch (9) joins the sympathetic plexus upon the internal carotid artery. The pterygo-palatine or pharyngeal nerve (11) is very small, and passes through the pterygo-palatine canal to the mucous membrane of the ripper part of the pharynx. The Internal Maxillary Artery gives off the following branches in the spheno-maxillary fossa : the descending palatine. Vidian, pterygo-palatine, spheno-palatine, and infra-orbital, the last of which has been already examined. 1. The posterior or descending palatine artery accompanies the great palatine nerve through the posterior palatine canal. It gives branches to the soft palate and uvula, which descend through theTHE TYMPANUM. 405 smaller palatine canals, and then runs forward on the hard palate, supplying it and anastomosing with the nasal or spheno-palatine artery at the anterior palatine canal. 2. The Vidian artery accompanies the nerve through the Vidian canal, and supplies the upper part of the pharynx and the Eustachian tube. 3. The pterygo-palatine artery is very small, and runs backwards through the pterygo-palatine canal. 4. The nasal or spheno-palatine artery enters the nose by the spheno-palatine foramen, and gives branches to the mucous-mem- brane of the upper part of the cavity, which anastomose wTith the anterior and posterior ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic artery. The nasopalatine branch runs down the septum of the nose with the naso-palatine nerve, and anastomoses with the artery of the septum from the facial trunk, and also with the descending palatine artery through the anterior palatine canal. The veins correspond, and open into the internal maxillary vein. The Otic Ganglion. [If the part is not too much decomposed, the otic ganglion may be exposed, from within, on the side upon which the internal pterygoid muscle has not been cut away. The levator palati muscle and the Eustachian tubs are to be carefully removed, when upon the inner surface of the pterygoid muscle will be found the nerve to that muscle, which if traced upwards will lead to the ganglion.] The Otic Ganglion (Fig. 212, 7) (Arnold’s) is a minute body lying on the inner surface of the third division of the fifth nerve, and especially connected with the branch to the internal pterygoid muscle. Like all the cranial ganglia, the otic has motor, sensory, and sympathetic roots ; the motor root from the 5th nerve; the sensory roots from the auriculo-temporal nerve, and from Jacobson’s nerve by means of the small superficial petrosal nerve of Arnold, which is connected posteriorly with the facial nerve in the temporal bone ; and the sympathetic root from that upon the middle meningeal artery. The otic ganglion gives branches to two muscles, the tensor tympani and the circumfiexus or tensor palati, i.e. it supplies two tensors as Meckel’s ganglion does two elevators (v. p. 376). The Tympanum. [If the tympanum has not been damaged in the previous dis- sections, an attempt may be made to trace the facial nerve through the temporal bone, thus : the base of the skull being turned upward, the saw is to be carried through a line drawn from the stylo-mastoidTHE TYMPANUM. 40G foramen to the foramen ovale. By this cut the cavity of the tympanum will be divided, and it will be possible to examine its walls and ossicula, together with the seventh nerve and the chorda tympani.] The Tympanum or Middle Ear (Fig. 212) is an irregular six- sided cavity, which may be conveniently said to resemble a room, with a passage (meatus auditorius externus) leading to it. The outer wall of the chamber is formed by the membrana tympani, which is placed obliquely at the end of the meatus, and consists of three layers, epithelial, fibrous, and mucous ; the inner wall corresponds to the outer wall of the vesti- bule and cochlea, parts of the internal ear; in front, is the opening of the Eustachian tube, with the special tube for the tensor tympani muscle formed by the processus cochleari- formis ; behind, is the opening into the mastoid cells. The roof of the chamber is a thin portion of bone separating it from the cavity of the cranium ; the floor is a thicker portion corresponding to the jugular fossa. The inner wall is the most important, and presents the following points for examination (Fig. 208): (1) the fenestra oralis in which the base of the stapes articulates ; below this (2) the fenestra rotunda, an opening into the cochlea closed by a membrane, the secondary mem- Fig. 212.—Internal view of the Otic ganglion and Tympanum (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

The Aqueduct of Fallopius, or canal for the facial nerve, forms a slight projection curving behind the pyramid and above the fenestra ovalis, and may be opened with bone-forceps in the part which has not been already divided with the saw. It extends from the bottom of the meatus auditorius internus to the stylo-mastoid foramen. In the upper part of the canal is the intumescentia ganglioformis, an enlargement of the facial nerve at the point where it is joined by the petrosal nerves through the hiatus Fallopii. The facial nerve in this part of its course gives off a minute branch to the stapedius muscle, and the chorda tympani. The Chorda Tympani (Fig. 212, 9) enters the tympanum close to the pyramid, and passes forward, between the handle of the malleus and the long process of the incus, to an opening between the Glas- serian fissure and the Eustachian tube (canal of Huguier), by which it leaves the temporal bone to join the lingual nerve (p. 369). The Ossicula Auditus (Fig. 212) are the malleus, incus, and stapes. The Malleus (hammer) (4) consists of a head, neck, handle (manubrium), and two processes (processus gracilis and processus brevis). The head articulates with the incus ; the manubrium is in- serted between the mucous and fibrous layers of the membrana tym- pani ; the processus gracilis is inserted into the Glasserian fissure ; the processus brevis gives attachment to the tensor tympani muscle. The Incus (anvil) (6) consists of a body and two processes. The body articulates with the head of the malleus; the short process is attached to the margin of the orifice of the mastoid cells ; the long process is nearly parallel to the handle of the malleus, and has at its extremity a small nodule of bone, the os orbiculare, which in the foetus is separate, but becomes united in adult life and articulates with the stapes. The Stapes (stirrup) is articulated by its head with the long process of the incus, and at right angles to it. The base, (at which the two crura unite) ij attached to the fenestra ovalis ; the neck gives attach- ment to the small stapedius muscle. The Muscles of the Tympanum are three in number, viz., the tensor tympani, laxator tympani, and stapedius ; but some anatomists add a fourth, the laxator tympani minor.THE TONGUE. 408 The Tensor Tympani (Fig. 212, 2) arises from the under surface of the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal hone and from the Eustachian tube, and runs backwards in a distinct canal formed by the processus cochleariformis, to be inserted into the root of the handle and the processus brevis of the malleus. It is supplied by a branch from the otic ganglion. The Laxator Tympani arises from the under surface of the spine of the sphenoid bone and from the Eustachian tube, and entering the tympanum through the Glasserian fissure is inserted into the neck of the malleus. It is supplied by a branch from the chorda tympani. The Stapedius arises from the interior of the pyramid, and emerges from its apex to be inserted into the neck of the stapes. It is supplied by a branch of the facial nerve. The Laxator Tympani Minor arises from the upper margin of the meatus extemus, and is inserted into the handle and processus brevis of the malleus. It is regarded as a ligament by many anatomists. The Tongue. [The tongue and larynx, which were laid aside, are to be examined without separating them. The branches of nerves and the several muscles, which were necessarily divided in removing the tongue, are to be identified before the examination of the organ itself is proceeded with.] The Tongue (Fig. 213) is connected with the os hyoides by mus- cular fibres, and by a membrane (hyo-glossal) which is deeply placed between the muscles. On its under surface and sides will be found the attachments of the extrinsic muscles of the tongue, viz., the hyo- glossus, stylo-glossus, palato-glossus, and superior constrictor (glosso- pharyngeus); and close to the median line will be seen the large genio-hyo-glossus of each side. All the anterior part of the dorsum of the tongue is covered by papillae, but behind a Y-shaped row of large (circumvallate) papillae the surface only presents the orifices of numerous mucous glands and follicles. The Papillae (Fig. 213) of the tongue are of three kinds, the Cir- cumvallate, Fungiform, and Filiform or Conical. The papillae circumvallatce (5) are from eight to fifteen in number, and are arranged in two oblique rows which meet at the foramen ccecum, a deep mucous follicle. Each papilla is surrounded by a fossa, and is covered on its free surface with secondary papillae. The circumvallate papillae are the special organs of taste, and are supplied by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve.409 INTRINSIC MUSCLES OF TONGUE. Fig. 213. The papilla fungiformes are scattered over the tongue, but par- ticularly at the tip and sides. They are globular in form and have slender attachments to the surface of the tongue ; they are of a dark red colour and are covered with, secondary papillae. The papilla conicce and jiliformes exist all over the tongue, but are most extensively developed at the tip. The conical papillae are covered with minute secondary papilla;, and the filiform are prolonged into thread- like processes, which in the carnivora are developed into spines. The orifices of mucous follicles may be found among the papillae on the dorsum of the tongue, and behind the papilla circumvallata are numerous compound racemose lingual glands, which lubricate the posterior portion of the organ. Beneath the mucous membrane is a fibrous layer or corium, which gives attach- ment to many of the muscular fibres. In the centre of the tongue and dividing it into two symmetrical halves is a fibrous septum, the existence of which is marked by a raphe in the median line. The Intrinsic Muscles are the Lin- gualis Superior, the Lingualis Transversus, and the Lingualis Inferior. The Lingualis Superior extends along the surface of the tongue immediately beneath the mucous mem- brane, being connected with the septum internally. The Lingualis Transversus constitutes the chief bulk of the tongue, and is placed beneath the lingualis superior. Its fibres are attached to the median septum and pass outwards to the mucous membrane, giving passage to the ascending fibres of the lingualis inferior.

It is larger than the lingualis superior, and extends along the under surface of the tongue, giving ascending fibres which pass between those of the transverse muscle, and being closely connected with the stylo-glossus muscle. Glands of the Frcenum (Blandin).—By removing the mucous mem- brane on the under surface of the tongue near the tip, a couple of oval glands may be seen. They are similar in structure to the sub- lingual glands although distinct from them, and are sometimes united in front, forming a single mass of an arched form (Deville). The Nerves (Fig. 198) of the tongue have been already examined, but may now be followed out minutely. They are the Hypoglossal nerve (9th) to the muscular structure of the tongue; the Lingual nerve (5tli) to the fungiform and filiform papilla) on the dorsum and apex of the tongue ; the Glosso-pharyngeal nerve (8th) to the circum- vallate papilla) at the base of the tongue and to the surface behind them. * The Larynx. The Larynx or organ of voice is closely connected with the hyoid bone and tongue. On tracing the mucous membrane from the dorsum of the tongue, it will be found to form three little frcena between the base of that organ and the prominent cartilage of the epiglottis ; these are the glosso-epiglottidean folds (Fig. 213, 9). After being reflected over the epiglottis, the mucous membrane forms the two arytceno-e'piglottidean folds, which bound the superior aperture of the larynx ; and is then carried to the interior of the larynx and over its posterior surface into the oesophagus. The Superior Aperture of the Larynx (Fig. 206) is bounded in front by the epiglottis, behind by the arytenoid cartilages, and on each side by the arytoeno-epiglottidean folds. On looking through it the Glottis or Rima Glottidis mil be seen, i.e., the space between the two inferior or true vocal cords, which varies from a mere chink to a triangular aperture with the apex forwards, according to the movements of the arytsenoid cartilages. Above the true vocal cords will be seen the less distinct false cords, and through the glottis may be seen the interior of the trachea. This view of the parts deserves especial notice, as it is exactly that which is seen reversed when reflected in the laryngoscope. [The larynx is to be fastened upon a table by driving a nail or pin through the tongue and putting the trachea on the stretch with hooks, the anterior surface being exposed; the extrinsic muscles ofINTRINSIC MUSCLES OF LARYNX. 411 the larynx, the sterno-hyoid, sternothyroid, thyro-liyoid, and inferior constrictor of the pharynx, are then to be carefully removed without injuring the crico-thyroid muscle or the external laryngeal nerve.] Intrinsic Muscles of the Larynx. The Crico-thyroid Muscle (Fig. 179, 22) is placed on each side of the crico-thyroid membrane and is somewhat triangular in shape, being narrow below and expanded above. It arises from an oval surface on the side of the cricoid cartilage, and ascends to be inserted into the posterior part of the lower border and inner surface, and into the inferior cornu, of the thyroid cartilage. It is supplied by the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. [The preparation is to be turned over and the mucous membrane is to be dissected off the back of the larynx, the remnant of the oesophagus being removed. The crico-arytaenoidei postici muscles on the back of the cricoid cartilage are readily dissected ; but in order to clean the cross-fibres of the arytaenoideus it will be necessary to over- distend the larynx so as to stretch the muscle ; and this may be most readily done by the finger of an assistant.] The Arytaenoideus (Fig. 214,6) is an example of a single muscle in the median line, its fibres crossing one another and being equally distributed on each side. It occupies the concave posterior surfaces of the two arytaenoid cartilages, the fibres passing from one to the other, and being divisible into superficial and deep layers. The superficial fibres cross obliquely from the apex of one carti- lage to the base of the other, and vice versa, so as to form an X, whilst the deeper fibres pass transversely between them. The arytaenoideus is supplied by both the superior and the inferior laryngeal nerves. The Crico-Arytsenoideus Posticus (Fig. 214, 7) arises from the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage on one side of the median ridge, and its fibres pass obliquely upwards and out- wards to be inserted on the posterior aspect of the prominent outer angle of the base of the arytaenoid cartilage. It is supplied by the inferior laryngeal nerve. Fig. 214.—Posterior view of the larynx (from Wilson). 1. Thyroid cartilage, right ala. 6. Arytcenoideus muscle, consisting 2.

[To seethe crico-arytaenoideuslateralis and the thyro-arytaenoideus muscles, the superior and inferior cornua of one half of the thyroid cartilage should he cut through and the ala drawn forward, any tissue being detached from its inner surface to within a quarter of an inch of the median line. A vertical cut is then to be made through it there with strong scissors or the bone-forceps, and the piece is to be removed. The larynx being distended as before, the muscles can be readily dissected.] The Crico-Arytsenoideus Lateralis (Fig. 215,6) arises from the upper border of the side of the cricoid cartilage, and its fibres pass obliquely upwards and backwards to be inserted into the anterior aspect of the prominent outer angle of the base Fig. 215. 0f the arytenoid cartilage. This muscle is al- ways more or less closely connected with the thyro-arytODnoideus, which is above it, and is supplied by the inferior laryngeal nerve. The Thyro-Arytaenoideus (Fig. 215, 7) has a more horizontal direction than the preceding muscle. It arises from the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage immediately external to the inferior or true vocal cord, and reaches down to the crico-thyroid membrane, to which some of its fibres are attached. It passes backwards, the upper fibres being more oblique than the lower ones, to be inserted into the anterior border of the arytenoid cartilage external to the attachments of the vocal cords. It is supplied by the inferior laryngeal nerve. [If a second larynx can be procured, a very satisfactory way of seeing the thyro-arytenoid muscles is to cut the thyroid cartilage horizontally at the level of the true vocal cords, when the muscles can be readily displayed immediately outside them.] Above the preceding muscles a few muscular fibres may be traced to the epiglottis from both the thyroid and the arytsenoid cartilages. These are the thyro-epiglottideus and the arytceno-epiglottideus, or the two sets of fibres have been considered as one muscle under the name of thyro-arytceno-epiglottideus. The upper muscle is contained in the Fig. 215.—Side view of tlie larynx, one ala of the thyroid cartilage removed (from Wilson). 1. Left ala of thyroid cartilage. 2. Eight arytsenoid cartilage. 3.

Actions of the Laryngeal Muscles. The cartilages are moved upon one another by the several muscles, producing an effect upon either the tension of the vocal cords or the size of the opening between them—the glottis. The Grico-thyroidei draw the thyroid cartilage downwards and forwards on the cricoid cartilage, and thus tighten the vocal cords. The Thyro-arytcenoidei being parallel to, and attached to the same points as, the vocal cords, must necessarily by their contraction approximate the points of attachment, and so relax the cords. The Crico-arytcenoidei postici swjng the arytenoid cartilages out- wards, and thus dilate the glottis ; as can be easily shown by making traction upon the two muscles simultaneously with the points of a pair of forceps. The Crico-arytcr.noidei laterales are antagonists to the postici, and bring the arytenoid cartilages back to their old positions, and after- wards approximate them, thus narrowing the glottis. The Arytcenoideus draws the arytenoid cartilages together, and thus (according to Mr. Bishop) narrows the glottis ; but it may be doubted -whether the superficial fibres which are inserted farthest out would not swing the cartilages upon their axes and thus widen the glottis. [A side view of the interior of the larynx is now to be obtained by cutting away the crico-arytenoideus lateralis, with the vocal cords and mucous membrane of the same side, but the cricoid cartilage is to be left entire.] On a Side-view (Fig. 216) of the interior of the larynx will be seen the horizontal projections of the mucous membrane formed by the superior and inferior vocal cords beneath it. Between the two cords is the cavity of the ventricle of the larynx, and from the front of this a probe can be carried into the laryngeal pouch or sacculus laryngis, which projects upward between the upper cord and the thyroid cartilage. The mucous membrane is continued from the ventricle into the sac, in which it is provided with numerous mucous glands. [The mucous membrane is to be dissected from the vocal cords, and their attachments are to be clearly shown.] The Vocal Cords or Thyro-arytaenoid Ligaments (Fig. 216)414 THE LARYNX. Fig. 21G. are four in number, two on each side of the larynx, the inferior pair, or chordae, vocales being composed of yellow or elastic fibrous tissue. The superior ligament or false cord (]i) has an arched direction, and is much more slender than the inferior ligament. It is attached in front to the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the projection on the upper part of the front of the arytamoid cartilage. The inferior ligament or true cord (i) is horizontal in direction, being attached in front to the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage below the superior ligament, and behind to the prominent anterior angle of the base of the aryte- noid cartilage. This is the free upper edge of the crico-thyroid membrane. The interval between the two true vocal cords is the rima glottidis. The Arteries of the larynx are de- rived from the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. The superior laryngeal artery, derived from the superior thyroid, enters the larynx through the tliyro-hyoid mem- brane, and divides into ascending and descending branches which supply the muscles and mucous membrane. The inferior laryngeal artery, derived from the inferior thyroid artery, reaches the back of the cricoid cartilage and anastomoses with the superior artery.

The superior laryngeal nerve (9) has been seen to give a branch {external laryngeal) to the crico-thyroid muscle, and then to pierce the thyro-liyoid membrane with the superior laryngeal artery. It supplies the mucous membrane of the larynx and back of the tongue, and gives a branch to the arytaenoideus muscle, besides a communi- cating branch to the inferior laryngeal nerve. The inferior or recurrent nerve (21) is the motor nerve of the larynx, and has been seen to take a different course on the two sides, winding around the subclavian artery on the right, and around the aorta on the left side, but in the larynx the "nerves have similar distributions. Each nerve running up the side of the trachea passes beneath the border of the inferior constrictor of the pharynx and beneath the ala of the thyroid cartilage, to end in branches to the muscles of the larynx. It supplies all the muscles of the larynx except the crico- thyroid, and thus one muscle, the arytaenoideus, is supplied from two sources, though it is doubtful whether the superior nerve does not perforate the arytaenoideus without supplying it, in order to reach the mucous membrane. [In order to see the ligaments which bind the several parts of the larynx together, it will be necessary to remove cautiously all the muscular fibres and mucous membrane.] The Thyrohyoid Ligament (Fig. 216, 8) connects the upper border of the thyroid cartilage with the hyoid bone. It is composed of yellow elastic tissue, and may be divided into a central portion or membrane, and two rounded lateral portions (9), which pass from the great cornu of the hyoid bone to the superior cornu of the thyroid cartilage, and in which a nodule of cartilage is often developed. The thyro-liyoid membrane is perforated by the superior laryngeal nerve and artery. The Crico-thyroid Membrane or Ligament (Fig. 216, l, m) is composed of elastic tissue, and passes between the borders of the cricoid and thyroid cartilages in the median line, but at the sides is prolonged to the inferior vocal cords, with which it is incorporated. The Crico-tracheal Ligament is between the lower border of the cricoid cartilage and the upper ring of the trachea, and is a simple membrane like that between the several rings of the trachea. Capsular Ligaments surround the articular extremities of the cartilages, which are also furnished with synovial membranes. These exist in the articulations between the cricoid and the inferior cornua416 THE LARYNX. The Thyroid Cartilage (Fig. 214, i) (dvpeos ddos, like a shield) is the largest cartilage of the larynx, and consists of two halves or aloe, which meet at an angle in front and form the pomum Adami. Each ala is quadrilateral in shape, and has a rounded posterior border into which the stylo- pharyngeus and palato-pharyngeus muscles are inserted, and which is prolonged into a superior and an inferior cornu. The superior cornu is the longer of the two and is non-articular, but the inferior cornu has been seen to articulate with the cricoid cartilage, and to give attachment to the crico-tliyroid muscle. of the thyroid cartilage; and between the cricoid and the bases of the two arytcenoid cartilages. The Thyro-epiglottidean Ligament (Fig. 216, c) connects the lower border of the epiglottis with the back of the thyroid cartilage, opposite the notch in its upper border. The Hyo-epiglottidean Ligament (Fig. 216, b) is a band of yellow elastic tissue passing between the apex of the epiglottis and the upper border of the hyoid bone. Cartilages of the Larynx. [The large cartilages of the larynx, viz. the thyroid, cricoid, two arytaenoid, and the cartilage of the epiglottis, are readily re- cognised, but two pairs of minute cartilages, the cornicula laryngis and the cuneiform cartilages, are to be looked for in the arytasno- epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane.] , Fig. 217.—Vertical transverse section of larynx with tongue (from University College Museum). 1.

The ridge gives attachment to the sterno-thyroid and thyro-hyoid muscles, and the surface behind it to the inferior constrictor of the pharynx. The inner surfaces of the alse are smooth, and in the receding angle formed by their junction seven structures are attached, viz. the thyro-epiglottidean ligament, the two pairs of thyro-aryt£enoid ligaments (false and true vocal cords), and the two thyro-arytsenoid muscles, just externally to the inferior ligaments or true cords (Fig. 216). The Cricoid Cartilage (Fig. 215, 4) (xpiKos eiSoy, like a ring) is a ring of cartilage, shallow in front (where it has been seen to be con- nected with the thyroid cartilage by a membrane, and has the crico- thyroideus attached to its surface), but deep behind, where it fills up a part of the space left between the posterior borders of the thyroid* The upper border of the deep portion presents two oval articular surfaces for the arytsenoid cartilages, external to which are the origins of the crico-arytsenoidei laterales. On each side, and near the lower border of the cartilage, are two small facets for articulation with the inferior cornua of the thyroid cartilage. The posterior surface is divided in the middle line by a vertical ridge, to which some of the fibres of the oesophagus are attached, the concave surface on each side giving origin'to the crico- arytsenoidei postici muscles. The Arytsenoid Cartilages (Fig. 216, d) (dpvralva, a pitcher*) are two in number, and are of a pyramidal shape. The base of each cartilage is triangular, and articulates with the upper border of the cricoid cartilage ; its anterior angle gives attachment to the true vocal cord, and its external angle to the crico-arytsenoideus posticus and crico-arytsenoideus lateralis. The apex is curved backwards and inwards, and is surmounted by the corniculum laryngis. The posterior surface of the cartilage is concave, and gives attachment to the arytsenoideus muscle; the anterior surface presents a small tubercle for the attachment of the false vocal cord, and also gives attachment to the thyro-arytsenoideus muscle ; the internal surface is smooth, and covered with mucous membrane. The Cornicula Laryngis or Cartilages of Santorini (Fig. 216,/) are two small conical cartilages connected with the apices of * This derivation has reference to the appearance of both cartilages taken together and covered by mucous membrane. In animals, which were the principal subjects of dissection among the ancients, the opening of the larynx, with the arytenoid cartilages, bears a curious resemblance to the mouth of a pitcher with a large spout (Wilson). E E418 LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAS. the arytaenoid cartilages and with the arytaeno-epiglottidean folds. They are composed of yellow fihro-cartilage. The Cuneiform Cartilages or Cartilages of Wrisberg (Fig. 216, rj) are two small bodies found in the arytaeno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane, and are sometimes wanting. They are com- posed of yellow fibro-cartilage. The Epiglottis (Fig. 216, a) is composed of yellow fibro-cartilage, shaped like a cordate leaf, and has been seen to be connected with the thyroid cartilage and the hyoid bone. It is covered with mucous membrane, upon removing which it will be found to be perforated, especially in the posterior aspect, by numerous holes, in which mucous glands are lodged. The large cartilages of the larynx are very apt to undergo calcareous degeneration in advanced life, and the epiglottis is not unfrequently thickened by disease or injured by ulceration. Ligaments of the Vertebras. [The ligaments of the spinal column are to be examined by re- moving all the remaining muscular fibres.] The Ligaments of the Bodies of the vertebrae are—1, the Anterior Common Ligament; 2, the Posterior Common Ligament; and 3, the Intervertebral Substance or Fibro-cartilage. The Anterior Common Ligament (Fig. 218, i) is a broad band of fibres extending down the front of the vertebral column, from the axis to the sacrum. The fibres are attached princi- pally to the intervertebral substances, and only slightly to the upper and lower margins of the vertebrae ; the deep fibres passing between the adjacent bones, but the superficial crossing three or more vertebrae. The ligament when divided will be seen to be thicker opposite the bodies of the vertebrae than on the inter- Fig. 218.

[To see the posterior common ligament it 'will be necessary to remove the spinal cord, if this has not been already done, as follows : the saw is to be applied over the pedicles of, say, six dorsal vertebra), and these being divided on each side, the remains of the spinal cord can be removed, when the posterior ligament will be seen on the backs of the bodies of the vertebrae ; and the ligamenta subflava can be dissected upon the vertebral arches which have been removed.] The Posterior Common Ligament (Fig. 219, 3) is found upon the posterior aspect of the bodies of the vertebra; from the axis to the sacrum. It is remarkable in being broad opposite the intervertebral substances, with which it is closely connected, and narrow oppo- site the bodies of the vertebrae, over which it stretches to allow of the passage of vessels to the bone. It is broader in the cervical than ir the lumbar region, but thickest in the dorsal region, and is composed of superficial and deep fibres like the anterior ligament. The Intervertebral Substance (Fig. 219, 1) is found between the bodies of all the vertebrae from the axis to the sacrum, and is largest in the lumbar region. Each substance is composed of fibrous tissue and fibro-cartilage externally, but has a soft elastic material in the centre. The substances vary according to the curves of the spinal column, being deepest in front in the cervical and lumbar regions and the reverse in the dorsal region. On dissecting the superficial fibres of an intervertebral substance they will be found to pass obliquely between the adjacent vertebra;, alternate layers taking opposite directions. By cutting through the attachment to one of the vertebrae with a strong knife, the pulpy material in the centre will be shown, and will expand considerably above the level of the fibro-cartilaginous rings around it. On making a vertical section of two or more vertebrae with their intervertebral substances, the structure of the intervertebral sub- Fig. 219.—Posterior ligament of the vertebrae (from Wilson). 1, 1.

E E 2420 LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAL stance will be best seen, and will be found to consist of fibro-cartil- aginous plates placed in front of and behind the central pulpy material. The plates of both series are arranged one within another, the superficial ones being slightly bent towards the surface and the deeper ones towards the centre. The Articular Processes are surrounded by Capsular Ligaments (Fig. 220, 2), which are looser in the cervical than in the dorsal and lumbar regions ; they permit a simple gliding movement (arthrodia) between the processes, which are invested by a simple synovial membrane. The Arches are united by the Ligamenta Subflava (Fig. 220, 1). These are to be seen on the internal surfaces of the arches which have been removed, and will be found to consist of a series of yellow elastic ligaments, extending between the arches of the vertebrae on each side of the middle line from the axis to the sacrum. Owing to the overlapping of the vertebrae, the ligaments are attached to the posterior surface of the arch below and to the anterior surface of the arch above, ex- tending from the articular process to the root of the spinous process on each side. The Spinous Processes are united by (1) the Interspinous and (2) the Supraspinous ligaments. The Interspinous Ligaments are placed between the spinous processes of the vertebrae, extending from the root to the tip of each, and being stronger in the lumbar than in the dorsal, and in the dorsal than in the cervical region. The Supraspinous Ligament is a fibrous cord extending along the tips of the spinous processes from the last cervical vertebra to the sacrum. It is continuous with the ligamentum nuchce, and is thicker in the lumbar than in the dorsal region. It is composed of superficial and deep fibres, which have the same arrangement as those of the anterior and posterior common ligament The Transverse Processes are connected by Intertransverse Liga- Fig. 220.—Internal view of the arches of three vertebra (from Wilson). 1.

Ligaments of the Atlas, Axis, and Occiput. [In order to examine the special ligaments of the first two cervical vertebrae and the occipital bone, it will be convenient to separate the whole of the cervical from the dorsal spine.] The ligaments of the first two vertebrae and the occipital bone may be conveniently divided into (1) those external to, and (2) those internal to the vertebral canal. The external ligaments more or less resemble the ligaments common to the vertebral column, but the internal ligaments have special relation to the movements of nuta- tion and rotation which are peculiar to this region. 1. The External Ligaments are the Anterior, Posterior, and Lateral Occipito-Atlantal, and the Anterior and Posterior Atlanto-axial liga- ments ; besides Capsular ligaments for the articular processes of the Fig. 221. vertebrae and the condyles of the occipital bone. The Anterior Occipito-Atlan- tal Ligament (Fig. 221) consists of a superficial and a deep portion. The superficial portion (i) is round, and is attached to the basilar pro- cess of the occipital bone above, and to the anterior tubercle of the atlas below. The deep portion (2) is broad and membranous, and is attached to the occipital bone close to the foramen magnum above, and to the upper margin of the anterior arch of the atlas below.

The Posterior Occipito-Atlantal Ligament (Fig. 222, 3) re- sembles the ligamenta subflava, hut is composed of white fibrous tissue. It is thin and membranous, and is attached above to the posterior margin of the foramen magnum, and below to the posterior arch of the atlas. On each side this ligament is perforated by the vertebral artery and suboccipital nerve, over which some of its fibres arch. The Lateral Occipito-Atlantal Ligaments (Fig. 222,4)are short strong bands, passing between the roots of the transverse processes of the atlas and the jugular processes of the occipital bone. Fig. 222. Fig. 223. The Anterior Atlanto-Axial Ligament (Fig. 221, 4) resembles the anterior occipito-atlantal ligament, and consists of a superficial and a deep portion. The superficial portion is round, and is continuous with the anterior common ligament, being attached to the anterior tubercle of the atlas and the body of the axis. The deep portion is broad and thin, and extends from the anterior arch of the atlas to the body of the axis.

The Posterior Atlanto-Axial Ligament (Fig. 222, 5) re- sembles the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament, and is composed of white fibrous tissue, lined by a layer of yellow elastic tissue. It ex- tends between the posterior arch of the atlas and the laminae of the axis. 2. The Internal Ligaments are the Occipito-Axial, the Cruciform, and the Odontoid ligaments. [To expose these ligaments it will be necessary to saw through the occipital bone obliquely on each side of the foramen magnum. The posterior part of the bone being removed, the arches of the atlas and axis are to be cut through on each side and removed, and any re- mains of the spinal cord dissected away with the dura-mater, when the occipito-axial ligament will be exposed.] The Occipito-Axial Ligament (Fig. 223, 5) (apparatus ligamen- tosus colli) is continuous with the posterior common ligament. It is Fig. 224. attached below to the back of the body of the axis, and above to the basilar groove of the occipital bone above the foramen magnum, through which it passes. [The occipito-axial ligament is to be divided and turned up and down, when the cruciform ligament of the atlas and axis will be brought into view, and immediately above the transverse portion will be seen the two oblique odontoid ligaments.] The Cruciform Ligament (Fig. 224) consists of a strong trans- verse ligament and two small vertical slips. The Transverse Ligament of the Atlas (Fig. 224, 2) is attached Fig. 224.—Posterior view of the ligaments connecting the atlas, axis, and occipital bone (from Wilson). 1.

The vertical slips of the cruciform ligament pass from the transverse ligament to the basilar process of the occipital bone and the body of the axis re- spectively, and by detaching the upper one the odontoid ligaments will be fully seen. The Odontoid or Check Ligaments (Fig. 224, 5) are two strong bands of fibres, which pass obliquely from the apex of the odontoid process to the margin of the foramen magnum on each side, and they thus check the rotation of the cranium and atlas upon the odontoid process. Between these is a central odontoid ligament (ligamentum suspensorium dentis), passing vertically between the margin of the foramen magnum and the top of the odontoid process. On cutting all the ligaments of the articulation except the trans- verse ligament of the atlas, the odontoid process will be found to be still firmly held in position, owing to the fact that the ligament sur- rounds the contracted neck of the odontoid process, which is consider- ably smaller than the head. There are two synovial membranes in connection with the odontoid process, one in front, between it and the posterior surface of the atlas ; the other behind, between it and the transverse ligament.TABLE 4.

THE THORAX. [The arms having been previously removed, the dissectors of the thorax should detach the remains of the pectoral, serrati, and abdo- minal muscles from the outer surfaces of the ribs and their cartilages, and dissect the external intercostal muscles.] The External Intercostal Muscles (Fig. 99,4) eleven in number, are placed between the ribs, being attached to the lower and upper borders of the adjacent bones, the fibres running obliquely downwards and forwards. The external intercostals extend from the tubercles of the ribs to their line of junction with the cartilages, beyond which point a thin fascia is prolonged to the sternum. Between the floating ribs the fibres cease at the extremities of the bones. The Internal Intercostal Muscles (Fig. 99, 5) take a direction opposite to that of the external muscles, and can now be seen partially near the sternum, where the external muscles are wanting, but are fully seen subsequently from within the thorax. [The knife is to be carried through the cartilages of all the true ribs as near the bones as possible, and then along the intercostal space between the 5th and 6th ribs to the lower part of the sternum. The sternum being sawn across at this point can then be turned up, the pleurae being divided near the median line so as to preserve the an- terior mediastinum, and the internal mammary vessels being neces- sarily cut across with the bone.] The Triangularis Sterni Muscle (Fig. 225, 3) lies at the back of the sternum, but is ordinarily damaged by the incision made for inject- ing the subject, and the muscle is therefore best seen on a fresh sternum from a post-mortem examination. It arises from the inner surface .of the ensiform cartilage and lower part of the sternum, and from the carti- lages of the last three or four true ribs ; and is inserted into the carti- lages of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th ribs. The triangularis sterni acts429 THE MEDIASTINA. as a muscle of expiration by depressing the ribs, and is supplied by the intercostal nerves. [The sternum, which is still attached by the muscles of the front of the neck, is to be divided in the centre, and the two halves are to be turned aside, so as to preserve the internal mammary arteries for after- examination.] On opening the thorax as directed, the lungs will be exposed by the necessary division of the pleurae, and will be seen to occupy the sides of the chest, having probably, unless attached by old adhesions, fallen back so as to leave the pericardium exposed. The great vessels of the heart will be seen emerging from the upper part of the peri- cardium, and if the lungs are fully collapsed, the roots of the lungs will be visible on each side. The pericardium will in all probability have been opened at the upper part to allow of the injection of the body, in which case a portion of the heart may be seen within it, and it may be advantageously closed with a stitc h. The Pleurae (Fig. 225) are two shut sacs of serous membrane lining the thorax and covering the lung, but have been opened in removing the sternum. One of the lungs is to be drawn forward, when its pleura can be readily traced over the inner surface of the sternum and ribs (costal or parietal layer) on to the back of the lung; thence over the lung (pulmonary layer) to the front of the root of the lung, by which it is directed to the pericardium, and carried forward to the sternum a little to one side of the median line. Frequently it will be impossible to trace the pleura in this manner, owing to the adhesions which have formed between the pleura costalis and pleura pulmonalis as the result of inflammation. When the lung is drawn forward, below its root will be found a fold of pleura connect- ing the lower lobe with the side of the pericardium, which is called the ligamentum latum pulmonis. The pleura will be seen to be reflected on the upper surface of the diaphragm below, and to be prolonged in a conical form above the first rib, where it may be felt in relation with the subclavian artery. The diaphragm rises higher on the right side than on the left, owing to the presence of the liver, and the heart has a direction to the left; hence the right bag of the pleura is the wider whilst the left is the longer of the two, and the lungs correspond in shape. The Mediastina (Fig. 225), are the spaces between the pleurae, and are three in number, anterior, middle, and posterior. The Anterior Mediastinum, which is now exposed, is the small space bounded by the sternum in front, the pericardium behind, andTHE THORAX. 430 the pleurae at the sides, and is placed a little to the left of the median line. It contains (1) the triangularis stemi muscle ; (2) the origins of the sterno-hvoid and sternothyroid muscles; (3) the remains of the thymus gland (a ductless gland largely developed in the foetus); (4) Fig. 225. the left internal mammary vessels ; some cellular tissue and a few lymphatics. The Middle Mediastinum is the space between the two lungs, and contains therefore (1) the heart and large vessels, (2) the pericardium, (3) the roots of the lungs, and (4) the phrenic nerves. The Posterior Mediastinum is behind the pericardium, and will he afterwards dissected. It contains (1) the thoracic aorta, (2) the trachea, (3) the oesophagus with the two pneumogastric nerves, (4) Fig. 225.—Diagram of a transverse section of the thorax (altered from Wilson and Carter, by J.

[To examine the middle mediastinum, the ribs should be divided about three inches from their cartilages, and the pieces turned back to give more room, but care should be taken to divide the first and second ribs in front of the attachments of the scaleni muscles. The lungs are to be drawn away from the heart, and the layer of pleura reflected on the pericardium is then to be carefully removed (the phrenic nerves lying between the two being preserved), and the roots of the lungs cleaned without injuring the pericardium.] The Pericardium (Fig. 225) is a fibro-serous membrane inclosing the heart and is of conical shape, the base being at the diaphragm and the apex lost in the great vessels, where it is incorporated with a process of the deep cervical fascia, which serves to maintain the position of the heart. The fibrous layer is pierced by and gives an investment to all the vessels connected with the heart, except the inferior vena cava, which pierces the central tendon of the diaphragm within the line at which the fibres of the pericardium are incorpo- rated with those of the central tendon of the diaphragm. The serous lining consists of a parietal and a visceral layer, the former be;ng in- separably united with the fibrous layer, and the latter covering the heart and being reflected on all the vessels for a short distance, but binding the aorta and the pulmonary artery together in a single tube of membrane. The Phrenic Nerves (Fig. 225, 4, 5) will be seen in the whole of their course, and should be carefully preserved. Arising from the 4th and 5th cervical nerves, and frequently by a small branch from the 3rd, they lie on the scaleni antici muscles in the neck, and then to the inner sides of those muscles upon the subclavian arteries. The two nerves enter the thorax on each side, and passing between the subclavian vein and artery, cross the internal mammary arteries from without inwards. The left phrenic nerve is then superficial to the left pneumogastric nerve, and crosses the arch of the aorta inter- nally to it; and both nerves pass in front of the roots of the lungs and between the pleurse and pericardium to the diaphragm, which they pierce and supply, the right having a small ganglion connected with it. The left nerve is longer than the right, having to pass round the heart to reach the diaphragm, which is lower on the left than the right side. Accompanying each nerve may occasion- ally be seen the small comes nervi phrenici artery from the internal mammary.432 THE THORAX. [The pericardium is to be dissected from the roots of the lungs, and entirely removed from the great vessels, except a small piece, which should he left to mark the point at which it was attached to the aorta.] The Hoots of the Lungs (Figs. 225 and 226) are each formed by a pulmonary artery, two pulmonary veins, and a bronchus, bound Fig. 226. together by cellular tissue; together with the small bronchial vessels, the pulmonary plexus of the pneumogastric nerve, and some lym- phatics. The order of the vessels from before backwards on both sides of the body is the same, viz. veins, artery, and bronchus; from Fig. 226.—The heart and lungs (from Wilson). 1. Right ventricle. 2.

The reason of this difference is, that the left bronchus passes beneath the arch of the aorta, and therefore becomes lower than the pulmonary artery on that side. The right pulmonary vessels pass beneath the arch of the aorta.* The Lungs (Fig. 226) will vary very much in condition in diffe- rent bodies. If perfectly healthy their surfaces will be smooth, and they will be somewhat contracted, but crepitant throughout. Every variety of disease may be found, the most common being tubercle and abscess in the upper lobes, with adhesion to the wall of the thorax, or pneumonic condensation through more or less of the organ. The lungs of subjects dying in large cities not unfrequently present black pigment in the lung tissue and the lymphatic glands. Each lung has a thin anterior margin and a thicker posterior one, which lies against the spinal column, and is longer than the anterior border. The anterior margin of the left lung is notched so as to leave the apex of the heart uncovered. The outer surface of the lung is convex and the inner concave; about the middle of this latter surface, and near the posterior border is a slit, the hilum, at which the root of the lung enters, whilst in front of it is a hollow corresponding to the heart, and larger in the left lung than the right. The base of the lung is moulded to the diaphragm, and is, therefore, lower behind than in front; whilst the apex is rounded and reaches into the neck above the first rib, extending to a point an inch and a half above the clavicle. The right lung is the larger, owing to the direction of the heart to the left, but is shorter than the left, owing to the position of the liver. The left lung is divided into two lobes (upper and lower) by a fissure running oblicprely across the external surface, from near the apex to the anterior border ; but the right has three lobes, owing to the existence of a second fissure running hori- zontally forward, from the middle of the first fissure to the anterior margin of the lung. The Heart (Fig. 227) is placed obliquely between the lungs, the base being to the right, and the apex to the left side; and resting on the diaphragm, which is now convex (the position of expiration), it is nearly horizontal. The base corresponds to the interval between the 5th and 8th dorsal vertebrae, and the apex beats between the 5tli and 6th ribs, the larger portion of the organ being to the left of the * It may be noticed that the order of structures from before backwards in the root of the lung corresponds to the arrangement in the hilum of the kidney, viz. vein, artery, ureter.

The left auriculo-ventricular opening (mitral valve) lies behind the third intercostal space, about one inch to the left of the sternum. The pulmonary semilunar valves lie behind the junction of the third rib of the left side with the sternum.

Right ventricle. l.v. Left ventricle.VEINS OF THE HEART. 435 aortic semilunar valves lie behind the third intercostal space, close to the left side of the sternum (Holden). For purposes of ausculta- tion the usual directions given are, the upper border of the third costal cartilage for the base of the heart, and a spot two inches below the nipple and one to the sternal side for the apex. The weight of the healthy heart averages lloz. in the male and 9oz. in the female. The anterior surface of the heart is convex, and is formed almost entirely by the right ventricle and auricular appendage, but the irregular border of the left auricular appendage appears to the left of the pulmonary artery.. The posterior surface of the heart is flattened, and is formed by part of the right auricle, and the left auricle and ventricle, which last forms the apex of the heart. Each surface of the heart is grooved vertically and horizontally, marking the divisions between the auricles and ventricles. The anterior ventricular groove is near the left border of the heart, whilst the posterior ventricular groove is to the right, and they thus indicate the oblique position of the septum. In these grooves will be seen the descending branches of the coronary vessels. The Coronary Arteries (right and left) are the first branches of the aorta, and supply the substance of the heart. They are to be found one on either side of the pulmonary artery, with a plexus (coronary) of nerves accompanying each. The left coronary artery runs from right to left in the auriculo- ventricular groove, and gives a large branch to the front of the heart, which appears to the left of the pulmonary artery and runs down the anterior ventricular groove to the apex. The right coronary artery runs from left to right in the auriculo- ventricular groove, and gives a large branch to the back of the heart, which runs along the septum to the apex. Both the vertical and horizontal branches of the two arteries anastomose, and supply branches freely to tbe substance of the heart. The Veins of the heart do not correspond precisely to the arteries. The great cardiac vein runs up the anterior ventricular groove with the descending branch of the left coronary artery, but leaves it to pass along the horizontal auxiculo-ventricular groove to the back of the heart. It becomes considerably enlarged and is then called the coronary sinus, and after receiving the posterior cardiac veins from the back of the heart, opens into the back of the right auricle. Some small anterior cardiac veins and other small veins called the venae cordis minima; pass directly into the right auricle. The superficial cardiac plexus of the sympathetic is situated f r 2THE THORAX. 43G immediately below the arch of the aorta, and gives branches to the front and back of the heart, which are seldom seen. To it may be traced the left superficial cardiac nerve of the sympathetic, a cardiac branch from the left pneumogastric, and branches from the deep cardiac plexus. The Great Vessels of the Heart (Fig. 226) have the following positions. The vena cava superior is to the right, and the pulmo- nary artery to the left, whilst between them the arch of the aorta is seen. The inferior vena cava can be seen piercing the diapliragm at the back of the heart, by dr awing the organ upwards. The Cavities of the heart are to be opened in situ, and in the order in which the blood enters them. [The right auricle is to be opened by one incision from the superior to the inferior vena cava, and another at right angles to it into the auricular appendage.] Right Auricle (Fig. 228, i).—The main cavity of the auricle is smooth internally, but in the appendix are the musculi pectinati, or muscular bands “ resembling a comb.” 'flu; endocardium, or lining membrane of the heart, is seen to be continuous with the lining membrane of the veins, and will be traced subsequently into the arteries. The large openings into the right auricle are (1) the superior vena cava (3), which enters at the upper • and anterior part; (2) the inferior vena cava (4), which enters at the lower and back part; and (3) the coronary sinus (7), which enters close above (4) the auriculo- ventricular opening (9) and below the Eustachian valve. The foramina Thebesii are numerous small openings which are found in the wall of the auricle, corresponding to the anterior car- diac veins and the vense cordis minim se. The tubercle of Lower is a projection which is occasionally found in the wall of the auricle, between the superior and inferior vense cavse. The coronary valve (8) (valve of Tliebesius) is a thin fold at the orifice of the coronary sinus, which serves to prevent regurgitation into it. The Eustachian valve (6) is a semilunar fold placed to the left of the vena cava inferior, and extending between it and the annulus ovalis immediately above the opening of the coronary sinus, which served in the foetus to direct the current of blood from the inferior vena cava through the foramen ovale. In the adult it is generally cribriform and often very imperfect.437 THE RIGHT AURICLE. The fossa ovalis and annulus ovalis (5) are remains of foetal structure, found on the inner wall of the right auricle, in the position of the foramen ovale, or communication between the two auricles in the foetus. The annulus ovalis is a muscular ring, which is generally well marked, and which surrounds the shallow fossa ovalis, formed by a thin membrane thrown across the foramen ovale. This membrane is Fig. 228. .—Right side of the heart laid open (from Wilson). Fig. 228 1. Cavity of right auricle. 2. Auricular appendix : in its cavity are seen the musculi pectinati. 3.

After birth the aperture gradually becomes obliterated, but not unfrequently a small oblique opening ■will be found, through which a probe can be introduced. [To open the right ventricle, its flaccid wall should be grasped with the left hand and the scalpel made to transfix it about half-way down, and well to the right side of the septum ; the knife being then carried towards the apex, the cavity of the ventricle will be opened. The left forefinger is to be passed up into the pulmonary artery, and will serve to guide the incision, which is to be pro- longed into that vessel if possible between two of the semilunar valves. All clots being removed, the whole of the ventricle will be displayed.] The Right Ventricle (Fig. 228, a) consists of a main cavity, the walls of which are irregular, owing to the projections of the mus- cular substance of the heart; and of a smooth funnel-shaped portion (infundibulum or conus arteriosus) leading upwards and to the left, into the pulmonary artery. The projections on the wall of the ventricle are the columna carnece (h) (fleshy columns) of which three varieties arc described : one in which the column merely stands out in relief, being attached to the wall of the ventricle in its whole length ; a second in which the column is attached at both ends but is free in the middle, so that a probe may be passed between it and the wall; and a third variety called the musculi papillares (g). These last project into the cavity of the ventricle and give attach- ment by their extremities to the chorda tendinece, or fibrous cords attached to the flaps of the auriculo-ventricular valve. The right auriculo-ventricular valve (e) consists of three portions, and is hence called tricuspid. The flaps are formed by a reduplica- tion of the endocardium or lining membrane of the heart, between the layers of which are some tendinous and muscular fibres, the former being continuous with the chordae tendineae. The entire valve is attached above to a fibrous ring (zona tendinosa), which bounds the auriculo-ventricular opening, and is divided below into three portions, anterior, posterior, and internal.* The anterior division of the valve is the largest and is in contact * The tricuspid valve is very irregular in its divisions, sometimes consisting of only two flaps like the mitral valve, and at others being divided into four or even six small portions. h439 THE RIGHT VENTRICLE. with the anterior wall, whilst the posterior flap lies against the posterior wall, which is formed by the posterior part of the septum ventriculorum. The internal or left flap, which is the smallest of the three, shuts off the infundibulum from the general cavity of the ventricle. The auricular surface of the tricuspid valve is extremely smooth, for the purpose of facilitating the flow of blood into the ventricles ; whilst the surface which corresponds to the walls of the ventricle is remarkably rough, from the prominences formed by the attachments of the chordae tendinese. The tricuspid valve acts during contraction of the ventricle (systole), and prevents the regurgitation of blood into the auricle l though even in health there is said to be a slight reflux, which has been termed the “safety-valve action” (King.) The internal division of the tricuspid valve serves to prevent the blood from flowing into the pulmonary artery, until the ventricle is fully distended and able to contract forcibly on its contents. The pulmonary artery is attached to a fibrous ring, which inter- venes between it and the muscular substance of the heart, but the lining membrane of the artery is continuous with that of the ventricle. The semilunar valves (to) of the pulmonary artery, two anterior and one posterior, are three reduplications of the lining membrane, strengthened by fibrous tissue which is collected principally at the attached border of each valve, the thin portion near the free border where the fibrous tissue is absent being called the lunula. The attached border is convex, and is fixed to the wall of the artery ; the free border is sub-divided into two slightly concave portions by a little fibrous body, called the corpus Arantii. The semilunar valves act during dilatation of the ventricle (diastole), and prevent the regurgitation^ of the blood from the pulmonary artery. The blood (which is venous or dark-coloured) is carried by the pulmonary artery to its bifurcation, and then by the right and left pulmonary arteries to the lungs, where it is aerated; and is brought back to the heart by the four pulmonary veins as arterial or red blood. The pulmonary veins open into the left auricle. [The left auricle is to be opened by one incision on its posterior aspect, placed vertically midway between the pulmonary veins, and another into the auricular appendage. The heart must be drawn well over to the right side to expose the cavity properly.]440 THE THORAX. The Left Auricle (Fig. 229, i) closely resembles the right auricle, but is altogether on a smaller scale, and its border is thinner and more “ crenate ” than on the opposite side. The openings are those of the four pulmonary veins, two on each side, and the left auriculo- ventricular opening. Fig. 229. The musculi pectinati of the auricular appendix are like those of the right side but smaller, and on the septum of the auricles will be seen the annulus ovalis and fossa ovalis corresponding to those on the right side, but the ring of muscular fibre is not so well developed. [To open the left ventricle, the left forefinger should be intro- duced through the auriculo-ventrieular opening, and the knife thrust through the wall of the ventricle near the apex to meet it.

The finger is next to he passed from below into the aorta, followed by the knife, which is to be carried through the front wall of the ventricle close to the septum, thus isolating the right flap of the mitral valve. The incision is to be prolonged into the aorta between two of the semilunar valves, and it will be found to be necessary to divide the pulmonary artery which lies in front of the aorta, but care should be taken to do so above the pulmonary semilunar valves.] The Left Ventricle (Fig. 229, 8) resembles the right, but its wall is thicker and its cavity reaches to the apex of the heart. The col/umnce carnece, musculi papillares, and chordae tendinece resemble those of the right side, but are more fully developed. The left auriculo-ventricular valve consists of two portions, and is hence called bicuspid, or (from the resemblance to a mitre) mitral. The flaps of the valve are composed of the lining membrane of the heart, strengthened by tendinous fibres derived from the chordae tendineae like those on the right side, and are attached to the fibrous ring bounding the- auriculo-ventricular opening. The right flap of the valve is anterior to the left flap, and is placed between the cavity of the ventricle and the orifice of the aorta, against which it lies during diastole of the ventricle. It is perfectly smooth on both surfaces, so as not to impede the current of blood into the aorta, thus differing from the left flap, of which the surface next to the wall of the heart is rough (Power). Between the anterior flap of the mitral valve and the aortic valves is a small space with aponeurotic walls— the intervalvular space of Sibson—which receives the aortic valves when distended in “ diastole.” The mitral valve acts during contraction of the ventricle (systole), and prevents the regurgitation of blood into the auricle. The anterior division of the mitral valve prevents the blood from flowing into the aorta, until the ventricle is fully distended and able to contract forcibly on its contents; and the pressure of the blood in the intervalvular space on the anterior flap of the mitral valve keeps the latter closed up to the end of the “ systole ” or contraction of the ventricle. The closure of the mitral valve accompanies the “ first sound ” of the heart, which is best heard at the apex. A bruit caused by disease of the valve would be heard in the same situation (Fig. 227, l.v.), and, if systolic, depends upon regurgitation through the valve, if diastolic, upon roughness of the surface over which the blood passes from the auricle.442 THE THORAX. A fibrous ring intervenes between the muscular tissue of the heart and the aorta, the lining membrane of which is continuous with the endocardium. The Aortic semilunar valves resemble those of the pulmonary artery but are more fully developed, and the corpora Arantii are better seen than on the right side. The aortic valves occupy a position the converse of those of the pulmonary artery, viz. one in Fig. 230. front and two behind ; and above each of the three valves there is a dilatation of the aorta, called the aortic sinus, or sinus of Valsalva. At the bottom of the anterior and left posterior sinuses will be seen the orifices of the coronary arteries, the first branches of the aorta. The aortic valves act during dilatation of the ventricle (diastole), and prevent regurgitation into the ventricle, their closure accom- panying the “ second sound ” of the heart, which is best heard over the base of the heart and on the sternum opposite the second inter- costal space (Fig. 227, ao.). If from disease of the valves their closure is not perfect and regurgitation occurs, a “ diastolic aortic bruit ” is produced : if the surfaces of the valves should be so roughened as to Fig. 230.—A section of the heart at the level of the valves, seen from above (from Sibson’s Medical Anatomy).

A horizontal section above the valves (Fig. 231) shows their relation to one another. The left ventricle occupies the posterior aspect of the heart, and the mitral orifice and valve are therefore behind. In front of this is the aortic orifice, separated only by a fibrous septum. To the left of the aorta, and a little in front, is the pulmonary artery, with its valves, and to the right is the tricuspid or right auriculo-ventricular valve. The Foetal Circulation (Fig. 231).—This will be the best opportunity for contrast- ing the adult circulation with that of the foetus. In the foetus the blood is brought from the placenta by the um- bilical vein, which enters the body at the umbilicus. It then passes along the longitudinal fissure of the liver, and at the transverse fissure divides into Fig. 231. Fig. 231.—Diagram of the Foetal circulation (from 'Wilson). 1. Umbilical vein proceeding from the placenta. (2). 3.

In the inferior vena cava the placental blood is joined by that returned from the lower extremities, and afterwards, through the hepatic veins, by that circulated through the liver; and is then poured into the right auricle. The Eustachian valve, of large size in the foetus, directs the current across the auricle to the foramen ovale, which is patent, and the blood enters the left auricle. From the left auricle the blood necessarily passes into the left ventricle, and is thence propelled through the aorta to the head and upper extremities. From these it is returned by the superior vena cava, which enters the upper part of the right auricle, and the blood descends at once into the right ventricle, thus taking a course at right angles to the former one. From the right ventricle the blood is propelled into the pulmonary artery, and a small portion reaches the lungs through the right and left pulmonary arte- ries, but by far the larger portion passes through the ductus arteriosus (a short tube connected with the pulmonary artery close to the bifur- cation), and enters the descending portion of the arch of the aorta. Through the aorta the blood reaches the iliac arteries, and a small portion passes by the external iliacs to the lower extremities, but the rest passes by the internal iliacs to the hypogastric arteries, which run to the umbilicus and then wind round the umbilical vein to the placenta, under the name of umbilical arteries. The Pulmonary Artery (Fig. 232, 13) has already been seen to arise from the right ventricle and to lie in front of the aorta. It then passes to the left side of the aorta, where it bifurcates into right and left pulmonary arteries, which go to their respective lungs ; the right being the longer of the two and necessarily passing beneath the arch of the aorta, and the left crossing the descending aorta. The position of each of the arteries in the root of the lung has been already seen, the right being below and the left above its bronchus. Connecting the pulmonary artery with the descending portion of the arch of the aorta is a fibrous cord, externally to which the recurrent laryngeal nerve of the left side passes from the trunk of the pneumo- gastric. This is the obliterated ductus arteriosus, which in the foetus is a vessel nearly as large as the aorta, passing from the left division of the pulmonary artery to the arch of the aorta just beyond the left subclavian. The Pulmonary Veins (Fig. 232, 19) are four in number, two to each lung. Their positions in the roots of the lungs have been seen, and they have been traced to the left auricle of the heart. The rightTHE ARCH OF THE AORTA. 445 veins are the longer and pass beneath the arch of the aorta, the left veins crossing the descending aorta. The Arch of the Aorta (Fig. 232).—The aorta has been seen to arise from the left ven- tricle, and it at first Fig- 2^'2. takes a course upwards and to the right side, but then backwards and to the left, thus forming an arch. For convenience of descrip- tion the arch is divided into three portions— ascending, horizontal or transverse, and de- scending. 1. The ascending por- tion (i), beginning op- posite the third costal cartilage of the left side, reaches as high as the upper border of the second costal cartilage of the right side close to the sternum. It is almost entirely enclosed within the pericardium, and is crossed at first by the pulmonary artery. In front of the pericardium are the sternum and both pleurae ; behind the ascending aorta is the right .—Diagram of the large vessels of the heart and lungs (from Wilson). Fig. 232 1.

Its branches are the two coronary arteries, which have heen already traced. 2. The horizontal or transverse portion has a direction backwards and to the left side, reaching from the second costal cartilage of the right side to the left side of the fourth dorsal vertebra. In front of this portion are the sternum and left pleura, and, from left to right, the left pneuinogastric with the small cardiac nerves and the left phrenic nerve ; behind are the trachea, the oesophagus and thoracic duct, and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Above is the left innominate vein ; and below are the left bronchus and the bifurca- tion of the pulmonary artery, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the obliterated ductus arteriosus. The branches of this portion are the innominate, tbe left carotid, and the left subclavian arteries. 3. The descending portion extends to the lower border of the fifth dorsal vertebra, where the descending thoracic aorta begins, but the division between the two vessels is arbitrary. It is invested almost entirely by the left pleura, which binds it to the side of the vertebra;. The Vena Cava Superior (Fig. 227 v.c.) is formed by the junction of the right and left brachio-cephalic or innominate veins, on the right of the innominate artery. The vena cava receives the vena azygos major just above the pericardium, and then, piercing the pericardium, passes in front of the root of the right lung to enter the upper part of the right auricle. Note.—The levels of the aorta here given are lower than those ordinarily laid down, but are the result of numerous independent observations by the author, and by Professor Wood, who originally investigated the subject, and whose paper, in the Journal of Anatomy for December, 1868, may be consulted with advantage. Great Vessels of the Root of the Neck. The three great branches of the second part of the arch of the aorta are the Innominate, the Left Carotid, and the Left Subclavian arteries. The Innominate Artery (Fig. 232, 4) passes upwards and to the right side, and at the stemo-clavicular articulation divides into the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries. It has in front of it the upper piece of the sternum, with the remains of the thymus gland, and the origins of the stemo-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles; and is crossed nearly at right angles by the left brachio- cephalic or innominate vein, and obliquely by the right inferior thyroid vein. Behind it at first is the trachea, but afterwards tire447 THE RIGHT INNOMINATE VEIN. prolongation of the right pleura into the neck. To the right side are the right innominate vein and right phrenic nerve; to the left side, the origin of the left common carotid, and afterwards the trachea. The innominate artery ordinarily gives off no branch, hut occasion- ally a small branch (thyroidea ima, middle thyroid artery of Harrison) arises from it or from the aorta close to it, and runs up the front of the trachea to the thyroid body. The Left Common Carotid Artery (Fig. 232, n).—The left common carotid runs upwards and to the left side, at a level anterior to that of the left subclavian artery, and from the left sterno- clavicular articulation its relations correspond to those of the right carotid artery (p. 331). The thoracic portion has in front of it the upper piece of the sternum, with the remains of the thymus gland, and the origins of the stemo-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles ; and is crossed by the left innominate vein. It lies against the trachea at first, and then upon the oesophagus and thoracic duct; having the innominate artery, the trachea, and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve to its right side, and the left pneumogastric nerve with its cardiac branches, the left sub- clavian artery and the pleura to its left side. The Left Subclavian Artery (Fig. 232, 12) extends from the arch of the aorta to the inner border of the scalenus anticus, and may be conveniently divided into a thoracic and a cervical portion. The thoracic portion is nearly vertical in its direction, and lies to the left side of, but in a plane posterior to that of, the left carotid artery. It is crossed by the left innominate vein and by the left pneumogastric and cardiac nerves; it lies against the spine; with the oesophagus and thoracic duct to the right side, and the pleura to the left. Irregularities of the Great Vessels.—The number and position of the branches of the arch of the aorta are subject to variation. The commonest variety is for the left carotid to arise from the innominate, thus reducing the branches to two ; hut four branches may be due to the right carotid and subclavian arising separately from the arch. Occasionally when four branches are present, the right subclavian arises from the extreme left of the arch, and passes to the right side in front of or behind the oesophagus. The left vertebral artery not unfrequently arises from the aorta between the left carotid and left subclavian; and the thyroidea ima may occasionally arise from the arch. The Right Innominate Vein (Fig. 227) commences at the inner end of the clavicle by the junction of the subclavian and internal jugular veins, and then descends on the outer side of the innominateTHE THORAX. 448 Fig. 233.

It is closely invested by the right pleura, and has the phrenic nerve on its outer side. The Left Innominate Vein (Fig. 235) commencing at a corre- sponding point to and in the same way as the right vein, runs obliquely downwards and to the right side, lying just above the level of the arch of the aorta and crossing its large branches. It unites with the right innominate vein on the right of the sternum, between the cartilages of the first and second ribs, to form the vena cava superior (p. 446). Branches.—Each innominate vein receives the internal mammary, the inferior thyroid, and the superior intercostal branches. The left vein receives in addition small thymic and pericardiac branches. [The ascending portion of the arch of the aorta and the venae cavae are to be divided, and the remains of the heart removed with the pulmonary vessels, which are to be cut close to the lungs. The arch of the aorta is to be held to one side by hooks, and the bifurcation of the trachea with the deep cardiac plexus dissected out.] The Deep Cardiac Plexus (Fig. 233) is situated on each side of the trachea close to its bifurcation. The right half of the plexus receives'all the cardiac nerves of that side, viz., three cardiac nerves from the three cervical ganglia of the sympathetic, the three cardiac branches of the pneumo-gastric, and the cardiac branch of its recur- rent laryngeal nerve. The branches of this half of the plexus are distributed to the right side of the heart and the right lung, and many of them have been necessarily destroyed. The left half (Fig. 234) of the plexus receives the same nerves as the right, with the exception of the superior cardiac nerve of the sympathetic and the inferior cardiac branch of the pneumo-gastric, which have been 7.

The branches of this half of the plexus are distributed to the left side of the heart and the left lung, and also communicate with the superficial cardiac plexus. The Trachea (Fig. 233, 24) is now sufficiently exposed for the examination of its relations, but its structure will be given with that of the lungs. The trachea extends from the lower border of the larynx, about the level of the fifth cervical vertebra, to the level of the fifth dorsal vertebra, where it bifurcates into the bronchi. The trachea occupies the middle line, lying in front of the oesophagus and vertebral column, and has the following structures in front of it in the neck : the sterno-hyoid and -thyroid muscles with the deep eervical fascia ; the isthmus of the thyroid body with the inferior thyroid veins ; and the arteria thyroidea ima from the innominate, if it exists. In the thorax it lies in the posterior mediastinum, and has in front the sternum with the remains of the thymus gland; the arch of the aorta and the nerves crossing it; the innominate and left carotid arteries (for a very short distance); and the left innominate vein. The Right Bronchus (Fig. 231, 17) is larger than the left, and has been seen to be posterior and superior to the pulmonary vessels in the root of the bang. It is about one inch long, and takes a more horizontal course than the left. The vena azygos major hooks round the right bronchus to open into the vena cava. The Left Bronchus (Fig. 231, 18) is nearly twice as long as the right, and takes an oblique course beneath the arch of the aorta, crossing the oesophagus and the descending aorta, and lying posterior to, but being visible between, the pulmonary artery and veins (p. 432). The Thyroid Body (Fig. 234, 19) has been seen incidentally in the dissection of the neck, but is now fully exposed for examination. It consists of two symmetrical conical lobes, placed on each side of the upper part of the trachea, and united opposite the second and third rings of the trachea by the isthmus. The lobes are subject to great variations in size, and when much hypertrophied constitute Bronchocele or Goitre. The thyroid body is covered by the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and occasionally a few muscular fibres pass from the hyoid bone to the isthmus, constituting the levator glandules thyroidece of Soemmering. It is abundantly supplied with blood by the superior thyroid and inferior thyroid arteries of each side, and occasionally by an additional branch from the innominate. The arteries freely anastomose in the substance of the body, ana return their blood by three veins on each side, viz., the superior and middle thyroid, which join the internal jugular vein, and the inferior451 THE (ESOPHAGUS. thyroid, which has been traced down the front of the trachea to the innominate vein. The thyroid body is composed of numerous closed vesicles contain- ing a yellow fluid, but its function is not understood. [The right lung is to be drawn forward, and the pleura divided where it is reflected from the lung to the wall of the thorax, and the parts in the posterior mediastinum are to be cleaned. The muscular oesophagus will be at once seen, and the right pneumo-gastric nerve is to be traced to it and to the back of the right bronchus. On displacing the oesophagus the side of the descending thoracic aorta will come into view, but it will be better seen in the dissection of the left side. The vena azygos major will be seen to the right of the aorta, and between the two will be found the slender and collapsed thoracic duct. The intercostal vessels will be seen crossing the back of the space, and near the diaphragm will be found the splanchnic nerves from the sympathetic cord, which is itself outside the mediastinum.] The Posterior Mediastinum (Fig. 225) is the interpleural space behind the pericardium, bounded by the vertebrce behind, the peri- cardium in front, and the reflection of the pleura on each side. It contains the trachea, oesophagus, and the two pneumo-gastric nerves; the descending thoracic aorta, vena azygos major and thoracic duct; and, at the lower part, the great splanchnic nerve with some areolar tissue and lymphatic glands. The (Esophagus (Fig. 233, 29) is a muscular tube continuous with the pharynx. It begins opposite the 5th cervical vertebra, and can now be seen to lie to the left side of the median line in the neck. It then passes through the superior aperture of the thorax, being in re- lation 'with the left common carotid artery, and reaches the front of the spine, passing behind the arch of the aorta and being crossed by the left bronchus. It is now seen to pass in front of the descending thoracic aorta, which it crosses very obliquely, to reach the left side and pass through the oesophageal opening in the diaphragm, opposite the ninth or tenth dorsal vertebra. The oesophagus is from nine to ten inches in length, and consists of two layers of muscular fibres, the outer longitudinal and the inner circular, which are of the striped variety in the upper part, but of the unstriped variety in the lower part of the tube. Within the muscular coats are a delicate fibrous coat and a simple mucous membrane with tesselated epithelium, which is thrown into longitudinal folds when the oesophagus is not distended with food. The long meshes of nerve npon the oesophagus are derived from the two pneumo-gastrics, and form the plexus gulce. a g 2452 THE THORAX. Fig. 234.

The Thoracic Duct (Fig. 235, 13) is a delicate tube about eighteen inches long, embedded in loose tissue between the aorta and the vena azygos major. By cutting away the remains of the diaphragm care- fully, it may be traced from the receptaculum chyli (12) opposite the second lumbar vertebra, and will be found to pass through the aortic opening to the right side of the aorta. It continues to the right of the aorta, lying between it and the vena azygos, as high as the fourth dorsal vertebra, and then crosses obliquely to the left of the spine behind the arch of the aorta, and runs along the left side of the oeso- phagus through the superior aperture of the thorax. In the neck the duct reaches as high as the sixth cervical vertebra, and then, crossing the left vertebral artery and thyroid axis, curves downwards in front of the scalenus anticus and phrenic nerve, to enter the left subclavian vein at its jimction with the left internal jugular. The duct occa- sionally passes higher in the neck, and opens into the jugular at the point where some irregular vein joins it. The duct is dilated near its termination, and is often double both there and in the thorax. It has valves at various points, and by opening the subclavian vein a pair may be found at its entrance into the vein, which prevent the reflux of blood into the duct. Between the ribs close to the vertebrae, some intercostal lymphatic glands may be found, which open into the duct.

The Vena Azygos Major (Fig. 236, 15) commences in one of the lumbar veins, and is to be traced through the aortic orifice of the dia- phragm. It lies to the right of the thoracic duct upon the vertebrae, cross- ing the right intercostal arteries, and receiving directly or indirectly all the right intercostal veins except the first. About the level of the seventh dorsal vertebra it receives the vena azygos minor, passing from the left side be- hind the aorta, and very generally a vertebra or two higher receives the vena azygos superior from the left side. It lastly arches forward over the right bronchus, and after receiving the right bronchial vein, opens into the superior vena cava just outside the pericar- dium. Frequently the superior inter- costal vein communicates with the vena azygos close to its termina- tion. The azygos veins contain some im- perfect valves, and form an important communication between the superior and inferior venre cavae. The Right Pneumo - Gastric Nerve (Fig. 233, 6) has been seen to enter the thorax between the sub- Fig. 235.—The course and termination of the thoracic duct (from Wilson). 1. Arch of the aorta. 2.

It is now seen to run backward to the right side of the trachea, along which it passes to the bifurcation, to form the posterior pulmonary plexus at the back of the right bronchus. The nerve then supplies the oesophagus, form- ing, with the nerve of the opposite side, a plexus of long meshes which has been called the plexus gulce. Lastly the right nerve reaches the back of the stomach. Cardiac branches from the trunk of the pneumo-gastric nerve and from its recurrent laryngeal branch arise in the thorax, and the cervi- cal cardiac branches may also be traced out, and will be afterwards seen to join the deep cardiac plexus. [The left lung is now to be drawn forward, and the pleura removed in the same manner as on the right side. The oesophagus with branches from the left pneumo-gastric will be seen near the dia- phragm, and upon displacing it, the descending thoracic aorta will be brought into view with the left splanchnic nerves and vena azygos minor.] The Left Pneumo-Gastric Nerve (Fig. 234, 31) enters the thorax between the left carotid and subclavian arteries, and passes behind the left innominate vein. It then crosses the arch of the aorta, around which it gives its recurrent branch (21), and can now be traced to the back of the left bronchus, where it breaks up into numerous branches to the left lung and, after giving branches to the oesophagus which unite with those of the opposite side in the plexus gulce, terminates on the anterior surface of the stomach. From the left recurrent branch cardiac nerves pass to the deep cardiac plexus. The Descending Thoracic Aorta (Fig. 234, 32) is the con- tinuation of the arch of the aorta, and extends from the lower border of the fifth dorsal vertebra to the twelfth dorsal vertebra, opposite which it passes through the aortic opening in the diaphragm to be- come the abdominal aorta. In its course it lies at first to the left, but afterwards in front of, the bodies of the vertebrae, crossing the vena azygos minor. It is crossed by the root of the left lung and, very obliquely, by the oesophagus, which overlies it near the diaphragm. The artery has the thoracic duct and the vena azygos major to its right side, and is closely invested by the pleura on the left side. Branches.—From the front of the aorta pericardiac, bronchial, oeso- phageal and mediastinal branches are given off, which can now be seen. From the back part of the aorta the right and left intercostal arteries arise, which will be afterwards traced.456 THE THORAX,THE AORTIC INTERCOSTAL ARTERIES. 457 a. The 'pericardiac branches are irregular. b. The bronchial arteries, one or two to each lung, run on the pos- terior surface of each bronchus and supply blood to the tissues of the lungs. A bronchial min accompanies each artery ; the right opening into the vena azygos major, and the left into the left superior inter- costal vein. c. The oesophageal arteries are four or five small branches to the gullet. d. The mediastinal are small twigs to the cellular tissue and glands of the posterior mediastinum. They anastomose with the pericardiac and oesophageal arteries, and form part of the sub-pleural mediastinal plexus of Turner. [The trachea is to be cut just above the bifurcation, and the lungs are then to be removed from the chest and kept for subsequent examination. The intercostal vessels, the azygos veins, and the gangliated cord of the sympathetic with its branches are now to be dissected out by removing the pleurae, and opportunity may be taken to follow out the thoracic duct, if this was not done satisfac- torily before.] The Aortic Intercostal Arteries (Fig. 236) are nine or ten in number on each side, and arise from the back part of the aorta. They supply the nine lower intercostal spaces, anastomosing with the superior intercostal artery above, and the arteries of the right side are necessarily longer than those of the left, owing to the position of the aorta to the left side of the median line. The upper arteries necessarily ascend to reach their proper intercostal spaces, but the lower ones run transversely, passing beneath the oesophagus, thoracic duct, vena azygos major, and gangliated cord of the sympathetic on Fig. 236.—Veins of the trunk and neck (from Cruveilhier). 1.

Each artery gives off a 'posterior branch close to the vertebrae, which passes backwards between the transverse processes to the muscles of the back, giving off a small spinal branch through the intervertebral foramen to the spinal cord and body of each vertebra (Fig. 225). The intercostal arteries lie against the external intercostal muscles at first, and are only covered by pleura. A vein and nerve are in relation with each artery, the vein being highest and the nerve lowest in most of the spaces, but the artery being below the nerve at first in the three or four upper spaces. The arteries then disappear beneath the internal intercostals, by the removal of one or two of which the vessels and nerves can be traced out. The artery soon reaches the lower border of the adjacent rib, along the groove in which it runs, being thus protected from injury in the operation of paracentesis thoracis. Lateral and anterior cutaneous branches are given off by both arteries and nerves, which have been already seen. The Intercostal Veins (Fig. 236) open into the azygos veins on each side. The vena azygos major of the right side has been already seen. The Vena Azygos Minor (Fig. 236, 18) commencing in the left lumbar veins (and often in the renal), pierces the left crus of the dia- phragm and receives the lower intercostal veins of the left side ; it has been seen to pass behind the aorta and open into the vena azygos major. The upper intercostal veins of the left side either open into the superior intercostal vein, or form a separate vein (vena azygos minor superior) which, communicating with the superior intercostal vein above, either terminates below in the vena azygos minor, or crosses the spine separately to open into the vena azygos major. The Intercostal Nerves (Fig. 234) are twelve in number and, with the exception of the first, accompany the intercostal arteries, and are distributed to the front and sides of the chest. The first nerve gives only a small branch to the first intercostal space, and then passes through the superior aperture of the thorax to join the brachial plexus. The Gangliated Cord of the Sympathetic (Fig. 233, 31) is placed over the heads of the ribs on each side of the thorax, just out- side the posterior mediastinum and beneath the pleura, being conti- nuous with the cervical portion of the sympathetic, the inferior cervical ganglion of which should now be dissected on the neck of the first rib.459 UPPER SURFACE OF THE DIAPHRAGM. The thoracic ganglia are generally said to correspond to the ribs in number, but there is seldom a distinct ganglion for the first rib, it being united with the inferior cervical ganglion; and occasionally two of the lower ganglia are united. The inferior cervical ganglion has branches of communication with the two lowest cervical nerves, and gives branches upon the vertebral artery, and an inferior cardiac nerve to the deep cardiac plexus (Fig. 234). The thoradc ganglia may be divided into two sets, upper and lower. From the six upper ganglia communicating branches are given to the six upper intercostal nerves, and to the pulmonary and aortic plexuses. From the six lower ganglia branches of communication are given to the six lower intercostal nerves, and the three splanchnic nerves arise. There are generally two branches of communication between each ganglion and an intercostal nerve, one grey and one white. Splanchnic Nerves (Fig. 233, 43).—The great splanchnic nerve is derived from four ganglia (7th, 8tli, 9th, 10th) by separate fibret,. The nerve runs inwards and thus enters the lower part of the medi- astinum, and, after piercing the crus of the diaphragm, joins the solar plexus in the abdomen. The lesser splanchnic nerve is derived from the 10th and 11th ganglia, and also pierces the crus of the diaphragm to join the solar or renal plexus. The least splanchnic nerve is derived from the 12th ganglion, and goes to the renal plexus. It is seldom found, because the lesser nerve is connected with the lowest ganglion. The Internal Intercostal Muscles (Fig. 236) can be seen be- neath the pleura without any further dissection. Beginning at the sternum the muscles reach as far as the angles of the ribs, at which points the intercostal vessels and nerves lying against the external intercostals are visible. The fibres of the internal intercostals take a direction contrary to that of the external intercostal muscles, i.e., they run forwards and upwards. The relation of the parts passing through the Superior Aperture of the Thorax can be now fully understood, and will be found in the following table and the accompanying diagram taken from nature (Fig. 237). The Upper Surface of the Diaphragm (Fig. 238) will now also be thoroughly exposed, the structures in relation with it having been already dissected; but these should be again carefully studied in con- nection with the muscle.460 THE THORAX. [The lungs, which have been removed and laid aside, are now to be dissected, and the structure of the trachea and lungs is to be examined.] The Trachea is about four inches and a half in length, and is con- vex in front, but flattened posteriorly, being composed of a series Fig. 237.

There are from sixteen to twenty cartilages, each measuring about two lines in depth, but decreasing in depth from above downwards. The last cartilage is peculiar, in Fig. 238. being cut obliquely on each side so as to be adapted to the com- mencement of the bronchi. The cartilages are connected together by fibrous tissue, and the first is similarly connected to the cricoid cartilage.

Within this again is a longitudinal layer of elastic fibres closely con- nected with the mucous membrane, the epithelium of which is columnar and ciliated. On looking into the lower end of the trachea, a slight septum will be seen between the two bronchi but placed to the left of the median line, thus favouring the passage of foreign bodies into the right bronchus, the orifice of which is seen to be larger than that of the [The trachea and bronchi are to be laid open from behind with scissors, and the divisions of the bronchi should be followed for a short distance into the substance of the lungs.] The Lungs.—The mucous membrane of the air tubes is of a pinkish colour and has ciliated epithelium. Numerous mucous glands are embedded in the submucous areolar tissue. On tracing the bronchi they will be found to divide (for the most Fig. 239.—Two primary pulmonary lobuli or infundibula (from Frey). a, a. Exterior of lobuli. b, b. Pulmonary vesicles. c, c.

The muscular fibres, which were only at the back of the large bronchi, surround the smaller tubes, and can be traced further than the car- tilages. The fibrous and elastic coats may be traced into the smallest ramifications of the air-tubes, which thus become eventually membra- nous. The minute bronchia terminate in intercellular passages, in which the mucous membrane is covered with squamous epithelium. Opening out of the intercellular passages are the air-cells, or alveoli, the average diameter of which is T£^th of an inch, and the septa be- tween which are formed by reduplica- tions of the lining membrane. (Fig. 241). The air-cells collected around the ex- tremity of each minute bronchial tube form a lobule or infundibulum, and these aggregated together form the substance of the lung, but the air-cells of one lobule have no connection with those of another. (Fig. 239). The pulmonary artery subdivides like the bronchus which it accompanies, giving a branch to each lobule, which ends in a plexus of capillaries distributed beneath the mucous membrane of the air-cells and their septa, and also on the walls of the inter- cellular passages; the capillaries of each lobule being distinct (Fig. 240). The pulmonary veins convey the arterialised blood from the lobules, and correspond to the branches of the arteries. They have no valves, and the veins of different lobules anastomose freely. The bronchial arteries, arising from the thoracic aorta, may be traced upon the bronchial tubes for some distance. They supply the substance of the lung, and their blood is returned partly by the bronchial veins and partly by the pulmonary veins. The bronchial veins open on the right side into the vena azygos, and on the left usually into the superior intercostal vein.

They can he traced upon the bronchial tubes for some distance, and are said to have minute ganglia developed upon them. The lymphatics of the lung are connected with the bronchial glands found about the bifurcation of the trachea. Articulation of the Ribs with the Vertebrae. The ligaments of the ribs may be divided into two sets, (1) those connecting the ribs with the bodies of the vertebrae (costo-vertebral), and (2) those connecting the ribs with the transverse processes (costo- transverse). 1. The costo-vertebral ligaments are Anterior, Capsular, and Inter- articular. The Anterior Cbsto-vertebral or Stellate Ligament (Fig. 242, 2) consists of three short fasciculi which radiate from the ante- rior surface of the head of the rib. The superior fasciculus passes to Fig. 242.-—Anterior ligament of the vertebrae, and ligaments of the ribs (from Wilson). 1. Anterior common ligament. 4. Interarticular ligament connect- 2.

The whole ligament is closely connected with the anterior common ligament of the vertebrae. This arrangement only holds good in the case of those ribs which articulate with two vertebra. In the case of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, which articulate with a single vertebra each, the stellate ligament is attached principally to that vertebra, but sends a few fibres to the vertebra above. The Capsular Ligament is a thin layer of fibres surrounding the articulation where the anterior ligament is wanting. The Interarticular Ligament (Fig. 242, 4) is seen by removing the stellate ligament, and is a short band passing between the ridge on the head of the rib and the intervertebral substance. It divides the articulation into two parts, each of which has a separate synovial membrane, but it is absent from the articulations of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, which have a single synovial membrane. 2. The Costo-transverse ligaments are Anterior, Posterior, and Middle. Fig. 244. The Anterior Costo-transverse Ligament (Fig. 242, 3) is attached to the upper border of the neck of all the ribs except the first, and ascends to the lower border of the transverse process of the vertebra above. It separates the anterior from the posterior division of the intercostal nerves. The Posterior Costo-transverse Ligament (Fig. 242, 4) is a short thick band, passing obliquely upward from the apex of the Fig. 244.—Transverse section of dorsal vertebra and ribs (Quain). 1.

[In order to see the middle costo-transverse ligament it will be necessary to make a horizontal section through the transverse process of a vertebra and the neck of the corresponding rib, when the short ligament will be found between the two. ] The Middle Costo-transverse Ligament (Fig. 244, 4) consists of short strong fibres passing between the posterior surface of the neck of the rib and the corresponding transverse process. A spiovial membrane exists between the facet upon each of the transverse processes of the ten upper dorsal vertebrae and the articu- lar tubercle of the corresponding rib. The anterior extremity of each rib has a hollow into which the costal cartilage fits, being firmly united by the periosteum. Chondro-Sternal Articulation.—The cartilages of the true ribs fit into depressions on the side of the sternum, and are attached by anterior and posterior ligaments. A band attaching the seventh rib to the xiphoid cartilage is called the costo-xiplioid ligament. The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth cartilages are connected together by fibrous bands. jShjnovial Membranes.—The first costal cartilage is continuous with the sternum and has no synovial cavity. The second and third car- tilages have a double synovial membrane, owing to the existence of an interarticular ligament. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh car- tilages have a single synovial membrane at the external articulation, and there are in addition three synovial membranes between the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth costal cartilages respectively.PART VI. DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND SPINAL CORD. In dissecting the Back it is customary for the dissectors of the arms to take the first two layers of muscles, and the dissectors of the head and neck the remainder of the region, including the spinal cord. [An incision is to be made from the occiput to the sacrum in the median line, and another along each crest of the ilium at right angles to it. The dissectors should then raise the skin with all the infil- trated fascia, going at once down to the superficial muscles, through which the cutaneous nerves appear. On the left side of the subject the arm is to be drawn forward so as to put the latissimus dorsi on the stretch, and the dissector should begin to clean the lower part of that muscle, and work upward to the trapezius ; on the right side the arm should be pulled down at first, and the head drawn over to the opposite side with hooks, to put the upper fibres of the trapezius on the stretch, and the dissector must begin at the upper border of that muscle (already exposed in the posterior triangle) and work down- ward to the latissimus dorsi. On both sides the arm and scapula will require to be moved from time to time to put the different sets of fibres on the stretch in turn.] The Cutaneous Nerves (Fig. 248) are derived from the posterior divisions of the spinal nerves, and are mostly of small size ; but the upper dorsal nerves reach the shoulder and the lumbar the buttock. The cervical and upper dorsal nerves pierce the trapezius close to the spine, the second and third turning up to the occiput ; the lower six dorsal and the lumbar nerves appear near the angles of the ribs and pierce the latissimus dorsi along the oblique line at which the muscular fibres commence ; and the sacral nerves give small branches through the tendinous expansion near the spine. The First Layer of Muscles (Fig. 245) consists of the Trapezius and Latissimus Dorsi. The Trapezius partially overlaps the latissi- mus, but between them and the base of the scapula is a small triangular interval in which the lower fibres of the rhomboideus major can be seen, and also, below that muscle, the posterior surfaces of two or three ribs and their intercostal muscles. h h 2468 THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK. The Trapezius (Fig. 245, i) of one side is triangular, but the two muscles together resemble a trapezium. It arises from the external Fig. 245.—First, second, and part of the third layer of muscles of the back: the first layer occupies the right; the second the left side (from Wilson). 1. Trapezius. 2.

The fibres converge to be inserted into the outer third of the posterior border of the clavicle, and into the upper border of the acromion process and spine of the scapula. The fibres thus have different directions, and the action of the muscle upon the scapula is said to vary according to the fibres brought into use. The action of the entire muscle is to draw the scapula towards the spine, and thus the two trapezii throw back the shoulders. When the scapula; are fixed by other muscles, the two trapezii throw the head back, or one muscle acting by itself would draw the head and spine to that side. The trapezius has been seen to be supplied by the spinal-accessory nerve and branches of the deep cervical plexus, it also receives branches from the posterior divisions of the nerves which pierce it. The Ligamentum Nuclice is a band of white fibrous tissue, which extends from the prominent spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra to the external occipital protuberance, being connected by small slips with the spines of the intervening vertebrae. It intervenes between, and gives origin to, the muscles of the two sides of the neck, and in the lower animals, being composed of yellow elastic tissue, it gives an important support to the head. The Latissimus Dorsi (Fig. 245, 4) arises by a tendinous origin from the posterior half of the outer lip of the crest of the ilium and the back of the sacrum ; from all the lumbar and the six lower dorsal spines; and from the outer surfaces of the three lower ribs, inter- digitating vdtli the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. The' broad muscular fibres become collected together as they wind round the inferior angle of the scapula, to which they sometimes have a slight attachment, and then pass forward and upward in front of the teres major, to be inserted into the bottom of the bicipital groove of the humerus. The fibres of the muscle are twisted, so that those which were highest at their origin are lowest at the insertion and vice versd. The latissimus dorsi, when taking its fixed point below, rotates the humerus inwards and then draws it behind the back, the two muscles, is seen attached to the spinous 18.

When the humerus is fixed, the muscle would draw up the trunk as in climbing, and may act as an extraordinary muscle of inspiration upon the lower ribs. It is supplied by the long subscapular nerve, and by the dorsal nerves which pierce it. [The trapezius is to be divided by a vertical incision near the spine, care being taken not to divide the subjacent tendinous origins of the rhomboidei in the cervical region. In reflecting the trapezius its tendon will be seen to glide over the smooth triangular surface at the inner end of the spine of the scapula. Care must be taken of the spinal-accessory nerve and the accompanying branches of the super- ficial cervical artery. The posterior surface of the levator anguli scapulae and the two rhomboidei muscles are now to be cleaned.] Second Layer of Muscles. The Levator Anguli Scapulae (Tig. 245, io) arises from the pos- terior tubercles on the transverse processes of the upper four cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the base of the scapula opposite the supraspinous fossa. The anterior surface of this muscle has been seen in the posterior triangle of the neck, where the levator covers the splenius colli muscle. The Rhomboideus Minor (Fig. 245, ii) is a narrow muscle arising from the ligamentum nuchae and from the spine of the seventh cervical vertebrae. It is inserted into the base of the scapula opposite the spine. The Rhomboideus Major (Fig. 245, 12) arises from the spinous processes of the upper four dorsal vertebrae, being often united with the minor; and is inserted into the base of the scapula opposite the infraspinous fossa, the middle fibres being attached to a fibrous arch, which is connected with the bone at its extremities. The three muscles of the second layer act upon the scapula, the levator drawing up the superior angle, and the rhomboidei drawing the lower part of the bone towards the spine, and thus tending to rotate the scapula and depress the glenoid cavity. The muscles are supplied by branches from the upper part of the brachial plexus and twigs from the cervical plexus. [The posterior belly of the omo-liyoid is to be traced out to the scapula, and the levator, rhomboidei and the upper half of the latissimus dorsi are then to be divided, when the scapula can be drawn away from the ribs, and the posterior surface of the serratus magnus muscle with a quantity of loose cellular tissue between it and the ribs will be brought into view. This muscle is to be divided by a vertical incision, and the clavicle being sawn through (if this has not already been done), the arm will be attached only by theTHIRD LAYER OF MUSCLES. 471 vessels and nerves, which may he cut through and the limh removed. Between the rhomboidei and the serratus will he seen an artery, which is the posterior scapular. The dissector of the arm will proceed at once with the dissection of the scapular muscles. The tendinous origin of the latissimus is then to lie removed to expose the subjacent muscles.] The Third Layer of Muscles (Fig. 245) consists of the Serratus posticus, superior and inferior, and the Splenius, which is divided into splenius capitis and splenius colli. The Serratus Posticus Superior arises from the ligamentum nuchse, and the spinous processes of the seventh cervical and upper two dorsal vertebrae ; it passes downwards to he inserted into the superior borders of the upper four ribs, externally to their angles. The Serratus Posticus Inferior (Fig. 245, 16) arises from the spinous processes of the last two dorsal and upper two lumbar vertebrae; it passes upwards to be inserted into the lower borders of the last four ribs externally to their angles. The serrati postici are antagonistic muscles, the superior raising the ribs, and being therefore a muscle of inspiration, the inferior depressing the ribs, and being therefore a muscle of expiration. [The serrati muscles are to be divided and turned aside, when the posterior portion of the fascia lumborum covering the deeper muscles, and united more or less with the origins of the latissimus dorsi and serratus posticus inferior, as well as with the subjacent muscles, will be seen. The name of vertebral aponeurosis has been given to the continuation of this structure beneath the serratus posticus superior and over the deep muscles; this is to be defined and afterwards must be removed.] The Splenius (Fig. 245) is single at its origin, which is from the lower half of the ligamentum nuchse, and from the spinous processes of the seventh cervical and upper six dorsal vertebrae. The splenius capitis (13), or upper portion, is inserted across the mastoid process and into the outer third of the superior curved line of the occipital bone, immediately beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle. The splenius colli (14), or lower portion, is inserted into the pos- terior tubercles on the transverse processes of the upper four cervical vertebrae.* The splenii draw the head and neck backward, and thus assist in maintaining the erect posture. One muscle acting alone, draws the head over to the same side, i.e. it antagonizes the sterno-mastoid. * The splenius is inserted into the posterior tubercles of the vertebrae which gave origin to the levator anguli scapula:.472 THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK. The splenius capitis was seen in the posterior triangle of the neck, but the splenius colli was hidden by the levator anguli scapulae. At the upper border of the splenius the nearly vertical fibres of the complexus appear.* The Fourth. Layer of Muscles (Fig. 246) consists of the Spinalis dorsi, the Erector spinse with its subdivisions, and the Complexus. The Spinalis Dorsi (Fig. 246,4) lies close to the spinous processes, arising from the last two dorsal and upper two lumbar spinous processes, and being inserted into the spinous processes of the upper six dorsal vertebrae. The Erector Spinse (Fig. 246, 1) is the great muscle filling up the hollow at the back of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. It arises from the posterior fifth of the inner lip of the crest of the ilium ; from the posterior surface of the sacrum ; from the transverse and spinous processes of all the lumbar vertebrae ; as well as from the aponeurosis covering the muscle. Opposite the last rib the erector divides into the saero-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi muscles, of which the sacro-lumbalis is the farther from the median line. The Sacro-Lumbalis (Fig. 246, 2) is the smaller of the two divisions, and passes upward and outward to be inserted into the angles of the six lower ribs. The Accessorius (musculus accessorius ad sacro-lumbalem) is placed internally to the sacro-lumbalis, and consists of muscular slips which pass from the lower six to the upper six ribs near their angles. The Cervicalis Ascendens (Fig. 246, 5) is placed internally to the accessorius, of which it is the continuation, arising from the upper four ribs, and being inserted into the posterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the lower four cervical vertebrae, with the exception of the seventh.f The Longissimus Dorsi (Fig. 246, 3), the inner division of the Erector spinae, is inserted into the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebrae, and into the ten lower ribs externally to their tubercles. The Transversalis Cervicis (Fig. 246, 6) is the continuation of the longissimus, and lies to its inner side, arising from the transverse * The student is advised not to burden his memory with the attachments of the remaining muscles of the back, with the exception of the small muscles of the suboccipital region.

It is inserted into the posterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the lower six cervical vertebra;. The Trachelo-mastoideus (Fig. 246, 7) is to the inner side of the transversalis, and between it and the complexus. It arises, with the transversalis, from the transverse processes of the upper four dorsal vertebrae and from the articular processes of the lower four cervical vertebrae ; and is inserted into the posterior part of the apex of the mastoid process beneath the splenius capitis. The Complexus (Fig. 246, 8) is a large muscle placed close to the vertebrae and reaching to the oc- ciput, and is remarkable for a tendinous intersection about its middle, and for being pierced by the great occipital and third nerves. It arises from the transverse pro- cesses of the upper six dorsal and last cervical vertebrae, and from the articular processes of the 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical vertebrae. Its fibres ascend nearly vertically to be in- serted into the occipital bone be- tween the curved lines. The most internal and superficial part of the complexus has been Fig. 246.—Fourth and fifth, and part of the sixth layer of the muscles of the back (from Wilson). 1.

The erector spina; is one of the most important muscles for main- taining the erect position of the trunk, and the complexus in addition draws back the head. Occipital Artery (Fig. 247, 3).—The second portion of the occi- pital artery is now exposed in its course between the muscles attached to the occipital bone. It was traced along the lower border of the digastric in the neck, and, leaving that muscle, it now runs beneath the splenius capitis and over or under the trachelo-mastoid, lying above the border of the superior oblique muscle, and then getting on to the complexus close to its insertion. It lastly pierces the trapezius to reach the back of the scalp, being accompanied by the great occipital nerve, which appears through the trapezius (1). The Arteria princeps cervicis is given off from this portion of the occipital artery, and divides into a branch to the trapezius and a descending larger one, which latter passes beneath the complexus to anastomose with the profunda cervicis artery on the semispinalis. [The complexus is to be divided transversely, at the point where the great occipital nerve pierces it, so as to preserve the nerve un- injured, and the muscle is then to be dissected up from the condensed cellular tissue beneath it and turned outward. The small muscles with the vessels and nerves of the suboccipital region are then to be dissected out, together with the semispinalis muscle which fills the vertebral groove in the cervical and dorsal regions. All vessels and nerves are to be carefully preserved.] The Fifth. Layer of Muscles (Fig. 247) consists of the two Recti, the two Obliqui, and the Semispinalis muscles. The Rectus Capitis Posticus Major (Fig. 247, 8) arises from the spinous process of the axis, and passes upward and outward to be inserted into the outer part of the inferior curved line upon the occipital bone, and into a small portion of the space below it. The Rectus Capitis Posticus Minor (Fig. 247,6) is placed close to the median line, and is slightly overlapped by the preceding muscle. It arises from the posterior tubercle of the atlas, and is inserted by fleshy fibres into the space below the inferior curved line on the occipital bone, close to the median line and to its fellow muscle of the opposite side. The Obliquus Inferior (Fig. 247, 18) arises from the spinous process of the axis, and is inserted into the posterior tubercle of the transverse process of the atlas. Around the lower border of this muscle the great occipital nerve makes its appearance. The Obliquus Superior (Fig. 247,10) is the continuation upwards475 THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY. of the preceding muscle. It arises from the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into a mark above or outside the outer part of the inferior curved line of the occipital bone, externally to the corn- plexus and overlapping the rectus major. The occipital artery has been seen to run along the upper border of this muscle. The recti muscles draw the head backward, and the rectus major, owing to its oblique direction, assists slightly in producing rotation. The obliqui produce rotation, the inferior oblique rotating the atlas upon the axis ; the muscle of one side acting with the supe- rior oblique of the other, which latter acts slightly upon the skull. Vertebral Artery (Fig. 247, 5). — The horizontal portion of the vertebral artery will be found in the triangle formed by the rectus posticus major and the two oblique muscles. It ascends through the foramina in the transverse pro- cesses of the vertebrae, beginning at the sixth, and having perforated the atlas is seen to wind in the groove beliind the superior articular process of that bone, and pierce the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament to enter the vertebral canal. Lastly it reaches the interior of the skull through the foramen magnum. Wliile in the transverse pro- cesses the artery gives small branches to the muscles and to the spinal cord, and in its horizontal portion it occasionally gives off a branch to the back of the skull to supply the muscles. The Vertebral vein does not accompany the artery in this part of Fig. 247. Fig. 247.—Suboccipital region (drawn by J. T. Gray). 1. Occipital artery and nerve piercing trapezius. 2. Trapezius. 3.

The vein ac- companies the artery through the transverse processes of the vertebra), and ends in the subclavian vein. The posterior division of the Suboccipital Nerve (Fig. 247, 7) (1st cervical) emerges between the occiput and atlas, and generally beneath the vertebral artery. It is of small size, and supplies branches to the recti and obliqui muscles and one to the complexus. The Great Occipital Nerve (Fig. 247, 9) is the posterior divi- sion (internal branch) of the second cervical nerve, and leaves the vertebral canal between the atlas and axis. It winds below the inferior oblique, giving a branch to that muscle, and then turns up- ward to pierce the complexus and trapezius muscles and supply the skin of the occipital region. Its external branch is of small size. The posterior division of the third nerve gives a branch which takes the same direction as the great occipital nerve but internally to it, and is joined with it. The suboccipital nerve often joins the internal branch of the 2nd, and the latter the internal branch of the 3rd (Posterior Cervical plexus). The Deep Cervical Artery lies upon the semispinalis colli muscle, and is exposed when the complexus is reflected. It is the posterior branch of the superior intercostal artery (p. 340), and reaches the back by passing between the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib. It supplies the deep muscles, anastomosing with the muscular branches of the verte- bral, and with the princeps cervicis of the occipital artery. There is thus an anastomosis established between a branch of the carotid and a branch of the subclavian artery, which would enlarge if the common carotid artery were tied.

Semispinalis colli (u) arises from the transverse processes of the six upper dorsal vertebrae and the articular processes of the four lower cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the spines of the cervical ver- tebrae from the 2nd to the 5th inclusive. Semispinalis dorsi (io) arises from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae from the sixtli to the tenth inclusive, and is inserted into the spinous processes of the last two cervical and upper four dorsal vertebrae. Spinal Nerves (Fig. 248).—The Posterior Divisions of all the spinal nerves (with the exception of the first cervical and fourth and fifth sacral and the coccygeal) divide into internal and external branches, which supply all the muscles of the back. The Internal branches of all the cervical nerves (except the first) and of the upper six dorsal nerves become cutaneous near the spinous processes. The External branches of the lower six dorsal and of all the lumbar nerves, become cuta- neous at an oblique line corresponding to the margin of the aponeurosis of the la- tissimus dorsi. The External branches of the upper sacral nerves become cutaneous near the median line. The fourth and fifth sacral nerves are very small and join with the coc- cygeal nerve.

The Posterior Divisions of the Intercostal and Lumbar Arte- ries divide like the nerves into internal and external branches, which accompany the nerves to the muscles of the back. The Sixth. Layer of Muscles (Fig. 246) consists of the Inter- spinales, Intertransversales, Multifidus Spime, and Levatores Costa- rum, which will not repay the trouble of dissection. The position of the Interspinales and Intertransversales is suffi- ciently indicated by their names. The Multifidus Spin* (16) fills up the vertebral groove beneath the erector spin*, arising from the articular processes of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae, and from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae and sacrum. The muscle is inserted into the spinous processes of all the vertebr* except the atlas. The Levatores Costarum are twelve fan-shaped muscles passing between the dorsal transverse processes and the upper borders of the ribs. The Spinal Cord and Membranes. [To open the spinal canal, the remains of the muscles of the back should be cleared away as far as possible, when some part of the plexus of clorsi-spinal veins may be seen upon the vertebr*. A block then being placed beneath the thorax so as to make the dorsal region prominent, a cut is to be made with the saw on each side of the middle line, so as to divide the lamin* of the vertebr* as far out as possible. Two or three of the arches being now removed with the chisel, the point of a spine-chisel or rachet is to be introduced into the canal and the rachet carefully hammered through the arches of the vertebr* for the whole length of the spine, except the upper two cervical vertebr*. The operation being repeated on the opposite side, the arches can lie removed with the bone-forceps, and the canal will be thoroughly opened. On the inner surface of the arches will be seen the ligamenta suhjiava, Avliich are described with the other vertebral ligaments (p. 420).] Upon opening the Spinal Canal some loose tissue and fat will be seen, together with the meningeo-rachidian veins, which are occa- sionally full, of blood. These extend for the whole length of the spinal cord under the name of posterior longitudinal spinal veins, 13. Scalenus anticus with phrenic nerve. 14. Vertebral vessels in transverse process. 15.

By removing the fat and veins the dura mater will be exposed. The Dura Mater (Fig. 250, i) of the spinal cord differs from the dura mater of the brain, in being comparatively smooth on its exterior, and in not forming the periosteum of the vertebrae. It also with the dura mater of the skull. The tube is largest in the cervical and lumbar regions, but at the top of the sacrum it becomes imper- vious, and is continued to the coccyx by a small fibrous process. Sheaths are given to all the spinal nerves, and take corresponding directions, being nearly horizontal in the cervical region and gradually becoming more vertical below. In the sacral canal the sheaths of the nerves lie side by side with the fibrous continuation of the dura mater between them. By removing the transverse processes of two or three of the dorsal vertebra* 1, the tubes of dura mater may be traced upon the nerves to the intervertebral foramina, and will be found to be lost upon the nerves themselves. [By opening one of the tubes of dura mater the position of the ganglion upon the posterior root in the intervertebral foramen will be seen. The cord is next to be removed by carrying the knife along the outside of the dura mater so as to divide the nerves as far out as possible, those which have been thoroughly exposed by the above dissection being divided beyond the ganglion. The cord attaching the dura mater to the coccyx is to be divided, and the sacral nerves cut as long as possible, and lastly the dura mater divided transversely at the level of the axis. The cord when removed is to be laid out on a table 'with the posterior surface uppermost.] Fig. 250.—Transverse section of the spinal cord and its membranes (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

The anterior and the posterior surfaces of the spinal cord, when removed from the body, may always he distinguished as follows :— 1. There is a bright shining cord (linea splendens) running down the anterior surface. 2. There is one spinal artery on the anterior, but two arteries on the posterior surface. 3. The posterior roots of the nerves are ganglionic. The Arachnoid (Fig. 250, 2, 3) consists of a parietal and visceral layer like the arachnoid of the brain, with which it is continuous. The parietal layer is seen on the inner surface of the dura mater, to which it is firmly attached ; the visceral layer is reflected loosely upon the spinal cord, giving to the several nerves loose sheaths, which are reflected upon themselves at the point where the nerves pierce the dura mater. The Subarachnoid Space (Fig. 250, 5) is between the visceral layer of the arachnoid and the pia mater of the spinal cord, and can be shown by lifting up the arachnoid with forceps, or by inserting a blow-pipe and forcing air beneath the membrane. This space com- municates with the interior of the brain by an opening at the lower extremity of the fourtli ventricle. It lodges the subarachnoid fluid, which also enters the ventricles, and is hence called cerebro spinal fluid.* [The cord is to be turned over so as to expose its anterior surface, and an incision is to be made through the dura mater to expose the arachnoid and subarachnoid space, as was done behind. The pia mater is then to be examined both on the front and back of the cord.] The Pia Mater encloses the spinal cord, giving prolongations upon the roots of the nerves. It is continuous with the pia mater of the brain, but is more fibrous and less vascular than it. It sends a process into the anterior median fissure of the cord, opposite to which is a fibrous band called linea splendens, and at the first lumbar vertebra (termination of the spinal cord) ends in the filum terminate or central ligament of the cord, which lies within the prolongation of the dura mater, to be attached with it to the coccyx. The Ligamentum Dentieulatum (Fig. 251, 16) is found on each side of the cord between the anterior and posterior roots of the * It has been supposed that a distinct serous membrane existed beneath the true arachnoid, in which the subarachnoid fluid was contained. Mr. Hilton has given prominence to this view in his “ Lectures on Rest and Pain ” (1863), but the question was decided some years since by Dr. Sharpey, who found that microscopically there was no evidence of a second serous membrane.THE SPINAL COED AND MEMBRANES. 482 nerves. It is formed by a series of twenty-one or two serrations, connected with the pia mater and with the inner surface of the dura mater midway between the apertures of exit for the nerves. It serves to sling the cord and secure it Fig. 251. from shocks. The Anterior Spinal Artery and the two Posterior Spinal Arteries may be traced upon the cord if well-injected. They are branches of the vertebral arteries, the anterior being formed by the junction of a branch from each side. The arteries ramify in the pia mater, anastomosing with the spinal branches which enter the vertebral canal through the intervertebral fora- mina. The Veins of the cord pass through the intervertebral foramina to join the vertebral, intercostal, and lumbar veins. The Spinal Cord (Figs. 250, 251) extends from the termination of the medulla oblongata at the level of the upper border of the atlas, to the first lumbar vertebra. It is cylin- drical in shape, but presents two flattened enlargements, one the bra- chial, which extends from the third cervical to the first dorsal vertebra, and the lower or lumbar enlarge- ment near the lower extremity of the cord. From the upper enlarge- Fig. 251.—Fourth ventricle and upper part of spinal cord and membranes. The posterior roots of the nerve are removed on the left side (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

The cord presents an anterior median fissure, which extends for its whole length, and a. posterior median fissure, wliich is most distinct at the upper and lower parts of the cord. A lateral fissure extends along the line of attachment of the poste- rior roots of the spinal nerves, thus dividing each half of the cord into an antero-lateral and a posterior column. The anterior roots of the nerves emerge from the antero-lateral columns, and these are sometimes considered to mark a further sub- division into anterior and lateral columns. At the bottom of the median fissures is the commissure, which is nearer to the anterior than the posterior surface of the cord. The Spinal Nerves (Fig. 251) are thirty-one in number on each side of the cord. Each nerve has been seen to arise by two roots, the posterior (with the exception of the first nerve) being larger than the anterior. The posterior roots, with the exception probably of the first nerve, have each a ganglion which is generally placed in the intervertebral foramen, at which point and immediately beyond the ganglion, the anterior (motor) and posterior (sensory) roots unite to form a spinal nerve of mixed endowments. The first two cervical, with the sacral and coccygeal nerves, are exceptions to the general rule as regards the position of the ganglia. The ganglia of the two cervical nerves lie upon the arches of the atlas and axis, at which point the roots of the nerves unite. The ganglia of the sacral and coccygeal nerves are within the sacral canal. Each spinal nerve divides into an anterior and a posterior trunk, the anterior divisions being the larger throughout, except in the case of the 1st and 2nd cervical nerves, of which the posterior is larger than the anterior division. The majority of the spinal nerves divide just outside the intervertebral foramina, but in the first cervical, the last sacral, and the coccygeal nerves, the division takes place within the dura mater; and the upper four sacral nerves divide within the sacral canal, the anterior and posterior trunks emerging at the anterior and posterior sacral foramina. On a transverse section (Fig. 250) the spinal cord will be found to consist of white nervous matter, in which are seen two grey crescents with their convexities turned toward one another and connected together by a grey commissure, in front of which are some white fibres forming the white commissure. i i 2THE SPINAL CORD AND MEMBRANES. 484 The anterior cornua of the grey crescents are larger than the posterior cornua, but do not reach to the periphery of the cord ; the slender posterior cornua are closely connected with the posterior roots of the spinal nerves in the lateral fissure. A small central canal (canal of Stilling) exists throughout the cord. It is impossible for the student in his ordinary dissection to inves- tigate the minute anatomy of the spinal cord, and he is therefore referred to works on minute anatomy for fuller details.PART VII. DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Befoee dissecting the Membranes or Vessels of the Brain, it will be well to recognise the several parts of the Encephalon, as this will assist the student in following the description. The upper part of the brain is formed by the Cerebrum or great brain, which is divided into two symmetrical halves by a median longitudinal fissure. The under surface or base of the brain is much more complicated than the upper surface, and will be subsequently examined more particularly. At the posterior part will be seen the Cerebellum or smaller brain, which consists of two symmetrical halves, like the great brain; these are united by a convex white body, the Pons Varolii, at the lower border of which is the upper part of the spinal cord or Medulla Oblongata. These parts will be readily recognised by referring to Fig. 253. [The brain is to be placed in a plate with the base upward, for the examination of the membranes and the dissection of the vessels.] The Membranes of the Brain are the Dura Mater, the Arachnoid, and the Pia Mater. The Dura Mater has been already seen lining the skull and giving off processes for the support of the brain (p. 299). The Arachnoid is a serous membrane which has been seen to consist of two layers—parietal, which lines the dura mater, and visceral, which is now to be examined. The Visceral layer is more or less united with the subjacent pia mater, but differs from it in passing from one convolution to another without dipping into the sulci. It passes into the great longitudinal fissure between the hemispheres of the cerebrum, but does not quite reach the corpus callosum, and may be conveniently traced from the anterior termination of this over the base of the cerebrum, (the lobes of which it binds together) to the cerebellum and medulla oblongata,48G ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. where it becomes continuous with the arachnoid of the spinal cord. It gives sheaths to the cranial nerves as far as the foramina of exit, where they are reflected to join the parietal layer of arachnoid. Between the arachnoid and the pia mater is the Subarachnoid Space, which contains the cerebro-spinal fluid, and which, though existing all over the brain, is only easily made out in the following places:— The Anterior Subarachnoid Space (diamond-shaped space) is imme- diately in front of the pons Varolii, and is formed by the stretching of the arachnoid from one middle lobe of the cerebrum to the other, as far forward as the optic commissure. The Posterior Subarachnoid Space will be found beneath the cere- bellum on lifting up the medulla oblongata. This communicates with the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord, and with the interior of the brain by means of an aperture into the fourth ventricle, which may now be seen by removing the layer of arachnoid. The Pia Mater is a vascular membrane closely investing the brain and passing into the sulci between the convolutions, besides giving processes into the interior of the brain which will be subse- quently examined. It becomes more tough and fibrous as it ap- proaches the spinal cord, upon which its vascularity almost entirely disappears. [The arachnoid is to be removed from the arteries at the base of the brain, which are to be cleaned and the branches followed. It will now be possible to show the longitudinal fissure between the two anterior lobes of the cerebrum more clearly than before, and also the fissure of Sylvius between the anterior and middle lobes of each side, into which a large artery may be traced.] The Arteries of the Brain (Fig. 252) are derived from four great trunks—the two vertebral and the two internal carotid arteries. The Vertebral Artery (i) has been seen to be a branch of the subclavian artery, and has been traced through the transverse pro- cesses of the cervical vertebras to the atlas. The artery pierces the dura mater between the occiput and the atlas, and enters the skull through the foramen magnum by the side of the medulla oblongata. At the lower border of the pons Varolii the two vertebrals unite in the Basilar Artery (6), which passes along the middle line of the pons Varolii to bifurcate at its anterior border into the posterior cerebral arteries (8). The Branches of the Vertebral Artery are - 1. A small Posterior Spinal artery (3), which runs down the poste- rior surface of the spinal cord with its fellow of the opposite side.ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. 487 2. A small Anterior Spinal artery (2), which joins its fellow of the opposite side to form a small trunk running down the anterior sur- face of the spinal cord. 3. A small Posterior Meningeal* artery (4) to the dura mater. 4. The Posterior' Inferior Cerebellar artery (5), which passes back- ward to the posterior part of the inferior surface of the cerebellum, and anastomoses with the other cerebellar arteries. The Branches of the Basilar Artery are :— 1. The Anterior Inferior Cerebellar arteries, a pair of small branches passing to the anterior part of the infeiior surface of the cerebellum on each side, and anastomosing with the other cerebellar arteries. These are only two of the following. 2. Transverse arteries of the Pons, four or five on each side, which supply the pons Varolii, and one of which, the auditory, accompanies the auditory nerve into the temporal bone. 3. The Superior Cerebellar arteries (7), which arise close to the bi- furcation, having the third pair of nerves between them and the pos- terior cerebral arteries. Each artery winds round the crus cerebri, parallel to the fourth nerve, to the upper surface of the cerebellum, where it anastomoses with its fellow and with the inferior cerebellar arteries. 4. The Posterior Cerebral arteries (8), which are the terminal branches of the basilar trunk. Each artery winds round the crus cerebri, par- allel to the superior cerebellar artery but separated from it by the third nerve, and is distributed to the under surface of the posterior lobe of the cerebrum, where it anastomoses with the middle cerebral artery. It gives off small branches to the locus perforatus posticus, and a choroid artery to the velum interpositum. The Internal Carotid Artery (Fig. 252, 10) has been traced to the anterior clinoid process of the sphenoid bone, close to which it was divided in removing the brain. The artery reaches the base of the brain close to the outer side of the optic commissure, and at once breaks up into three branches—the anterior and middle cerebral, and the posterior communicating arteries. 1. The Anterior Cerebral artery (13) runs forward in the longitu- dinal fissure, and, turning round the corpus callosum, is distributed to the anterior part of the cerebrum. The arteries of the two sides are united at the commencement of the fissure by a short transverse branch, the anterior communicating artery (14). 2. The 3Iiddle Cerebral artery (12) is a larger branch, which runs in the fissure of Sylvius between the anterior and middle lobes, and reaches the surface of the brain, where it anastomoses with the488 ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. anterior and posterior cerebral arteries. It gives off some small branches near its commencement, which pierce the locus perforatus anticus. 3. The Posterior Communicating artery (9) is a long slender branch, Fig. 252. which runs backward to join the posterior cerebral artery at a right angle. A choroid artery is given off by either the carotid or the middle Fig. 252.—Arteries of the Brain and Circle of Willis (from Wilson). 1. Vertebral arteries. 2.

The Circle of Willis (Fig. 252) is the name given to the com- munication between the arteries at the base of the brain, and may be traced on either side from before backward as follows :—Anterior communicating, anterior cerebral, and carotid arteries ; posterior communicating, posterior cerebral, and basilar arteries. This free anastomosis is of importance in carrying on and equalising the circu- lation of the blood in the brain, when an obstruction to one of the main trunks occurs. Various irregularities of the vessels forming the circle of Willis may be met with, the arteries being much above or below their normal size in various parts of the circle ; but the direct communi- cation between the trunks is almost constant. The Veins of the brain open into the sinuses of the skull, which have been examined (p. 301). The Base of the Brain. [The arachnoid and pia mater are to be carefully dissected from the base of the brain, care being taken not to detach any of the nerves. It should be noticed that the pia mater disappears, on the outer side of each crus cerebri, beneath the middle lobe of the cerebrum ; this is the commencement of the great transverse fissure of the brain, which opens into the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle. The pia mater upon the cerebellum and posterior part of the cerebrum should be left undisturbed, so that the velum interpositum may not be damaged.] The under surface of the great brain or Cerebrum is divided into three lobes on each side of the median line. The Anterior Lobe (Fig. 253, 2) of the cerebrum is separated from the middle lobe by the fissure of Sylvius, and from the opposite side by the longitudinal fissure. Its under surface is hollowed out in the centre, and fits closely upon the orbital plate of the skull. It presents several small orbital convolutions, and close to the median line the extremity of the convolution of the longitudinal fissure (marginal convolution), in which, about half an inch from the fissure and parallel to it, is the olfactory sulcus which lodges the olfactory peduncle. The Middle Lobe (Fig. 253, 18) of the cerebrum is separated from the anterior lobe by the fissure of Sylvius, but is continuous with the posterior lobe, the division between the two being marked only by the border of the cerebellum, the under surface of which is now seen. It occupies the middle fossa of the base of the skull, and pre-490 BASE OF THE BRAIN. sents the convolutions forming the temporal lobe, to be afterwards described. The Posterior Lobe is not divided from the middle lobe by any marked fissure, but is that part of the cerebrum which is above the cerebellum. It will be most convenient to examine the several structures found in the base of the brain in front of the pons Yarolii from before backward, first in the median line and afterwards on each side. In the median line from before backwards are—(1) the longitudinal fissure; (2) the lamina cinerea; (3) the optic commissure ; (4) the tuber cinereum (with the infundibulum and pituitary body); (5) the corpora albicantia; (6) the locus perforatus posticus. On each side from before backward are—(1) the under surface of the anterior lobe of the cerebrum, with (2) the olfactory bulb and the olfactory peduncle resting in the olfactory sulcus ; (3) the optic nerve (in front of the commissure), and (4) the optic tract (behind the com- missure) ; (5) the locus perforatus anticus close to the commencement of (6) the fissure of Sylvius ; (7) the crus cerebri diverging from its fellow, with the commencement of the transverse fissure to its outer side ; (8) the third nerve appearing between the divergent crura ; (9) the fourth nerve winding round the crus ; (10) the under surface of the middle lobe of the cerebrum. The Longitudinal Fissure (Fig. 253, i) is the terminal portion of the fissure which divides the upper surface of the brain into the two hemispheres. It separates the anterior lobes of the cerebrum, and, if these are drawn apart, a white body will be seen at the bottom of the fissure, which is the corpus callosum; the anterior part, around which the anterior cerebral artery turns, being known as the genu, and the central portion continued into the lamina cinerea as the rostrum. The Lamina Cinerea (Fig. 253, 4) is a thin grey layer, con- tinuous with the under surface of the corpus callosum and prolonged to the margin of the optic commissure. This is often torn in remov- ing the brain. The Optic Commissure or Chiasma (Fig. 253, 7) is the point of communication between the two optic nerves. The fibres of each optic tract are said to have the following arrangement :—The outer- most fibres pass to the optic nerve of the same side ; the middle fibres decussate with those of the opposite side forming a figure of X, and pass to the optic nerve of the opposite side ; the most internal fibres are reflected back to the brain along the opposite optic tract behind the cross arrangement, and a few fibres of the optic nerve pass in front of it from one eye to the other.THE TUBER CINEREUM. 491 The Tuber Cinereum (Fig. 253, 8) is a grey body placed imme- diately behind the optic chiasma. Projecting from it is the infun- dibulum (funnel), a tube connected with the pituitary body, which is generally left in the sella turcica upon the removal of the brain. The infundibulum communicates with the third ventricle of the brain Fig. 253.—The base of the brain (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Longitudinal fissure. 2. 2. Anterior lobes of cerebrum. 3.

The pituitary body (if left attached) will be seen to be solid in the adult, and to consist of two lobes of a reddish colour. The anterior lobe is the larger, and is oblong in shape ; the posterior lobe is round. The relation of the infundibulum and pituitary body to the tuber cinereum will be better understood by referring to the vertical section of the brain (Fig. 263, 20). The Corpora Albicantia or Mammillaria (Fig. 253,10) are two white bodies resembling small peas, which are placed between the two crura cerebri. They are formed by the anterior crura of the fornix which, as will be afterwards seen, descend to the base of the brain and there make a sudden twist upon themselves, thus forming the bodies. Upon section grey matter will be found in the interior of each body (Fig. 256, 8). The Locus Perforatus Posticus (Fig. 253, 12) (Pons Tarini) is placed in the angle between the two crura cerebri. It is composed of grey matter, and is perforated by numerous vessels going to the thalamus opticus. The several structures which have been enumerated in the median line, viz., lamina cinerea, optic chiasma, tuber cinereum, corpora albicantia, and locus perforatus posticus, are all included within the area of the circle of Willis, and also form the floor of the third ven- tricle of the brain, as will be seen on referring to a vertical section (Fig. 263). The Olfactory Peduncle (First nerve) (Fig. 253, 3) is of a pris- matic shape and is very soft, being destitute of neurilemma and only held in its place by a reflection of the arachnoid. The peduncle has three roots, two white and one grey. The external root (white) passes across the fissure of Sylvius in the middle lobe, and may be traced to the corpus striatum ; the internal root (white) goes to the inner side of the anterior lobe ; the middle root (grey) passes to the papilla of grey matter in the olfactory sulcus. The Olfactory Bulb (Fig. 253, 3) is formed upon the extremity of the olfactory peduncle, and from it the branches of the olfactory nerve arise which descend to the nose. It contains grey matter, is oval in shape, and rests upon the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. The Optic or Second Nerve (Fig. 253, 7) passes from the optic commissure to the eye-ball, where it is lost in the retina. It is round and firm, and is invested by a sheath of dura mater. It has been493 THE PONS VAROLII. shown that each optic nerve has fibres derived from the opposite as well as from its own side of the body. The Optic Tract (Fig. 253) is a flattened band connecting the optic commissure with the brain. It can be seen disappearing around the crus cerebri and beneath the middle lobe, and will be afterwards traced to the corpora geniculata, to the optic thalamus, and to the corpora quadrigemina. The Locus Perforatus Anticus (Fig. 253, 6) is situated close behind the olfactory nerve, and at the inner end of tire fissure of Sylvius. It is composed of grey nervous matter, and is perforated by numerous small branches from the middle cerebral artery. The Fissure of Sylvius (Fig. 253, 5) runs outwards between the anterior and middle lobes of the cerebrum, and is occupied by the middle cerebral artery. It corresponds to the margin of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone when the hrain is in situ, and is divided into two portions on the outer aspect of the brain, which will be subsequently traced. At the bottom of the fissure will be seen a few nearly straight convolutions (gyri operti) aggregated together, to which the name Island of Reil or central lobe has been applied. The Crus Cerebri (Fig. 253, 14) (peduncle of the cerebrum) is one of two large white bodies, which appear at the anterior border of the pons Yarolii and diverge to enter the under surface of the cere- brum. It is continuous with the anterior columns of the spinal cord through the pons Yarolii. Winding round each crus are the optic tract and the fourth nerve, and between the two crura is the inter- peduncular space containing the tuber cinereum, the corpora albicantia, and the locus perforatus posticus. The Third Nerve (Fig. 253, 9) (motor oculi) is a good-sized nerve, which appears with its fellow between the crura cerebri in front of the pons Varolii. The fibres are connected with the grey substance of the crura (locus niger), and may be traced to the floor of the fourth ventricle. The Fourth Nerve (Fig. 253, 11) (trochlearis vel patheticus) is .the smallest of the cranial nerves, and winds round the crus cerebri. It will be afterwards traced to the valve of Vieussens. The Pons Varolii or Annular Protuberance (Fig. 253, 16) is the large white body immediately behind the crura and in front of the medulla oblongata. It is more or less convex from side to side, but is slightly grooved along the middle line by the basilar artery. On each side is a round thick process of white fibres passing obliquely outwards and backwards to the cerebellum, which is the crus cenbelli or processus a cerebello ad pontem. Emerging from the side 0 theBASE OF THE BRAIN. 494 pons is the fifth nerve, and overlying it (in this position) is the sixth pair of nerves. The Fifth Nerve (Fig. 253,13) (trifacial, trigeminal) is the largest of the cranial nerves, and consists of two portions, motor and sensory, of which the motor is the smaller and the anterior. The nerve arises from the side of the pons Varolii, a few fibres of which intervene be- tween the two roots ; but its deep origin can be traced to the floor of the fourth ventricle. The Sixth Nerve (Fig. 253, 15) (abducens oculi) arises from the anterior pyramid of the medulla oblongata close to the posterior border of the pons, and slightly from the pons itself. It may be traced deeply to a nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle. The Medulla Oblongata (Fig. 253) is the upper part of the spinal cord, and extends from the upper border of the atlas to the lower border of the pons, being about an inch and a quarter in length. The medulla oblongata contains all the elements of the spinal cord, which are continued through it to the great brain, and has in addition a special body, the olive or olivary body, and a number of grey nuclei for the origin of several nerves. It will be impossible to see more than the superficial anatomy of the medulla at this stage, the rest will be taken with the dissection of the cerebellum. The medulla is divided into two symmetrical halves by an Anterior Median Fissure, which is continuous with the anterior fissure of the spinal cord. On either side of the fissure is the rounded Anterior Pyramid (corpus pyramidale) (20), which is continuous with the anterior column of the cord ; the two anterior pyramids decussate across the median fissure at the lower part of the medulla. The Lateral Tract (24) is continuous with the lateral column of the spinal cord. At the lower part of the medulla it is broad, and is placed between the anterior pyramid and the restiform body, but at the upper part it is narrowed and pushed aside by the projection of the olivary body between it and the anterior pyramid. The Olivary body (22) is an ovoid projection close to the anterior pyramid and immediately below the pons, but is separated by a groove from the surrounding parts. Some white fibres arching below and over the olivary body have been called the arciform fibres. The Restiform body is only slightly seen at the side of the medulla in this view, but will be afterwards dissected with the fourth ventricle. The Seventh Nerve (Fig. 253) consists of two portions, the portio dura or Facial nerve and the portio mollis or Auditory nerve, the495 THE NINTH NERVE. facial being anterior and the auditory posterior; and between the two is a minute nerve, which has been named pars intermedia and joins the facial nerve. The portio dura (17) is round, and smaller than the portio mollis ; it arises from the lateral tract of the medulla oblongata close to the pons, and slightly from the pons itself The deep origin can be traced to the floor of the fourth ventricle. The portio mollis (19) is flattened and very soft, owing to the absence of neurilemma. It arises from the floor of the fourth ventricle and from the restiform body, around which it winds to join the facial nerve. The deep origin of the nerve is partly from the auditory nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle, and partly from the posterior pyramid of the medulla. The Eighth Nerve (Fig. 253) consists of three portions, the Glosso-pharyngeal nerve, the Pneumo-gastric nerve, and the Spinal- accessory nerve, which lie in that order from before backwards. The Glosso-pharyngeal nerve (21) is the smallest of the three nerves, and arises from the lateral tract of the medulla oblongata by three or four fibrilhe. The Pneumo-gastric or Vagus nerve (23) arises from the lateral tract below the glosso-pharyngeal, by a number of fibrillce which unite to form a single nerve. This lies parallel to the glosso-pha- ryngeal nerve and upon (in this view) a small lobe of the cerebellum, which has therefore been called the lobe of the pneumo-gastric or flocculus. The Spinal-accessory nerve (25) arises partly from the medulla and partly from the spinal cord. The upper part (accessory to vagus) arises by fine fibrilhe, below the origin of the pneumo-gastric, for the whole length of the medulla. The spinal portion (Fig. 251, 9) arises by fine fibrilhe from the side of the spinal cord, between the ligamen- tum denticulatum and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, as low as the sixth cervical nerve. The deep origins of the eighth pair may be traced to special nuclei in the floor of the fourth ventricle. The spinal fibres are connected with the grey matter of the spinal cord. The Ninth or Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 253, 27) arises by numerous fib rill re from the groove between the anterior pyramid and the olivary body. The nerve consists of two bundles which pierce the dura mater separately. The deep fibres may be traced to a special nucleus at the lower part of the fourth ventricle. [By slicing down the pons Yarolii the arrangement of its trans-'96 EXTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. verse and longitudinal fibres may be seen. These are in alternate layers, the transverse being continuous with the crura cerebelli, and the longitudinal with the fibres of the cord and the crura cerebri. On slicing one of the crura cerebri deeply, a mass of grey matter (locus niger) will be found.] The Exterior of the Brain. [The brain being placed witli the base downwards, the pia mater is to be removed from the upper surface of the cerebrum.] The Upper Surface of the Brain (Figs. 254 and 255) is divided into two symmetrical halves, or hemispheres, by the longitudinal Fig. 254.

K KEXTERIOR OF THE BRA.IN. 498 (p. 493), separating the anterior from the middle lobe, can now be traced out, and will be seen to divide into two portions, the posterior or horizontal, which runs between the frontal (f) and temporal (t), lobes, and the anterior or vertical (c) which ascends between the frontal convolutions. Posterior to this portion of the fissure of Sylvius is a well-marked groove, the fissure of Eolanclo (d) which, beginning at the margin of the longitudinal fissure, runs downward and forward nearly to the horizontal Sylvian fissure, being bounded in front and behind by two large and well-marked convolutions, and separating the frontal from the parietal lobe. The Parallel Fissure (/) is a well-marked fissure parallel to and below the horizontal Sylvian fissure, and running between the con- volutions of the temporal lobe. The Parieto-occipital fissure (li) separates the parietal and occipital lobes more or less completely, being sometimes a mere notch at the upper margin of the hemisphere. It is continuous with the parieto- occipital fissure seen on the inner surface of the hemisphere, which commences near the posterior extremity of the corpus callosum, where it is continuous with the calcarine fissure, and passes upwards and backwards to the upper surface of the hemisphere. The Frontal Lobe (f) contains one well-marked vertical convolu- tion bounding the fissure of Rolando, and called the ascending frontal convolution (4), with three more or less horizontal convolutions in front of it, named respectively lower (1), middle (2), and upper (3) frontal. The Parietal Lobe (p) contains one well-marked vertical convolu- tion posterior to the fissure of Rolando, and called the ascending parietal convolution (5), with three more or less horizontal convolu- tions behind it, named respectively the parietal lobule, the supra- marginal lobule, and the angular gyrus. The Parietal Lobule (5') is continuous with the ascending parietal convolution, and lies along the margin of the longitudinal fissure, being connected to the upper part of the occipital lobe by the first annectent convolution (a). The Supra-marginal Lobule (a) lies below the preceding, and above the fissure of Sylvius. It is very variable in shape and size, and is connected posteriorly with the following convolution. The Angular Gyrus (6) is posterior to the supra-marginal lobule, and is very irregular in form. Behind, it is connected with the occipital lobe by the second annectent convolution (/3). Between the ascending parietal convolution and the supra-marginal lobule is the commencement of a fissure named by Turner intro-INNER SURFACE OF HEMISPHERE. 499 parietal, which takes a curved course between the convolutions of the parietal lobe. The Temporal Lobe (t) contains three well-marked horizontal con- volutions. The first (7) lies between the fissure of Sylvius and the parallel fissure, and the second (8) and third (9) are immediately below, separated from one another by the inferior temporal fissure. The second and third temporal convolutions are connected with the occipital lobe by the third (y) and fourth (5) annectent convolutions. The Occipital Lobe (o) is continuous with the temporal lobe, and contains three badly-defined convolutions placed horizontally, and named first (10), second (11), and third (12), [A slice of brain substance about an inch thick is to be removed from the right hemisphere, when the centrum ovale minus will be exposed.] The Centrum Ovale Minus is the oval mass of white cerebral matter, surrounded by convolutions, which forms the hemisphere. The convolutions will be seen to have a cortical layer of grey sub- stance superficial to their white substance, which is continuous with the centre of the hemisphere. Numerous minute points will be seen on the surface of the white matter, which are the puncta vasculosa or orifices of minute blood-vessels, from which blood exudes in the recent condition. The Inner Surface of the Hemisphere. [By slicing off one hemisphere to the level of the corpus callosum, a side view of the opposite hemisphere will be obtained, but to com- plete the study of the inner surface of the hemisphere a section of a hardened brain should be referred to.] The Inner Surface of the Hemisphere (Fig. 256) at its anterior part presents two large convolutions, the upper, the marginal con- volution (1) (convolution of longitudinal fissure), and the lower, the convolution of the corpus callosum (2) or gyrus fornicatus, separated by the calloso-marginal fissure (c m), which reaches the margin of the hemisphere and bounds the marginal convolution posteriorly. The Cyrus Fornicatus (2) is a well-marked convolution, which begins at the anterior perforated space in the base of the brain, and winds round the corpus callosum to the posterior part, where it becomes continuous with the upper internal temporal convolution or uncinate gyrus. Posterior to the marginal convolution, and continuous below with the gijrus fornicatus is the quadrate lobe (q), which is separated from K K 2500 INNER SURFACE OF THE HEMISPHERE. the occipital lobe (o) by the parieto-occipital fissure (p o), a continuation of the fissure of the same name seen externally. The Occipital Lobe (o) is triangular in shape, and is placed between the parieto-occipital and the calcarine fissure (c), which separates it from the internal convolutions of the temporal lobe (t). The Calcarine Fissure (c) of Huxley runs below the occipital lobe to the extremity of the gyrus fornicatus, being joined midway by the parieto-occipital fissure. It is an important fissure, since it corre- sponds to the projection called the hippocampus minor in the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle. The Internal Temporal Convolutions form the lower part of the inner wall of the hemisphere, and are continuous with those of the temporal lobe externally. The most important is the Uncinate Gyrus (3), which is immediately below the calcarine fissure and runs horizontally for- Fig. 256.—The inner and under surfaces of the brain to show the convolutions (from Hirschfeld and Leveille).

It then makes a sudden bend backward for half an inch, this liook-like process, from which it derives its name, be- coming united with the tsenia hippocampi. The Collateral Fissure (Co) separates this last convolution from the inferior temporal convolutions, which are very irregular. It causes the prominence in the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle known as the eminentia collaterals. The Dentate Fissure (io) is that immediately above the uncinate gyrus and lodges the1 fascia dentata, corresponding to the hippo- campus major in the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. Im- mediately above this is a small dentate convolution (4), united with the tenia hippocampi, and continuous below with the uncinate gyrus. The Interior of the Brain. The Centrum Ovale Majus is seen by slicing the opposite hemi- sphere to the level of the corpus callosum. It is the great white mass formed by the continuation of the fibres of the corpus callosum into the hemispheres, the grey convolutions surroimding its circumference. The Corpus Callosum (Fig. 257, 4) forms the great commissure of the brain, and consists of fibres passing transversely from one hemi- sphere to the other. It is nearer the anterior than the posterior ex- tremity of the brain, and in the median line forms the floor of the longitudinal fissure, being slightly arched from before backwards. On a vertical section (Fig. 256, 6) it will be seen to bend abruptly ante- riorly, to pass to the base of the brain, thus forming the genu, and to be continuous posteriorly with the subjacent fornix by a thickened portion which has been called the splenium. On the surface of the corpus callosum and in the middle line is a longitudinal depression, the raphe, which is bounded on each side by the slight projections called the nerves of Lancisi. Externally to these are some transverse markings called the linece transversce, which are crossed beneath the gyrus fornicatus by the longitudinal fibres form- ing the covered band of Reil. The Lateral Ventricles. [To open the cavity in each hemisphere called the lateral ventricle, the corpus callosum is to be carefully cut through about half an inch from the middle line, until the delicate serous membrane lining the ventricle is seen; the handle of the scalpel should then be used toTHE LATERAL VENTRICLE. 502 reflect the brain substance and expose the cavity, which bends from the median line in front, and towards it behind.] The Lateral Ventricle (Fig. 257) consists of a central cavity and three cornua, anterior, posterior, and descending. The anterior cornu turns outward in the anterior lobe of the cerebrum, and the posterior Fig. 257. cornu turns inward in the posterior lobe of the cerebrum, thus form- ing, with the central portion, a cavity shaped (on the right side) like the italic letter /. The body of the ventricle is bounded superiorly by the corpus callosum, which forms its roof, the floor being formed by the following parts, from before backwards—1. Corpus striatum ; 2.

Fornix. The Corpus Striatum (Fig. 257, 3) is a pyriform body with the greater end forward, and constitutes the superior ganglion of the cerebrum. It is grey upon the surface, but if cut into, will be found to have white fibres interspersed throughout the deeper portion (and hence the name), becoming grey again at the under surface. The two corpora striata are separated posteriorly by the two thalami. The Taenia Semicircularis (Fig. 257, 6) is a narrow band of white matter, which becomes slightly widened posteriorly, and connects the corpus striatum with the optic thalamus. The Thalamus (opticus) (Fig. 257, 7) is a white body, which will be better seen in a subsequent dissection. The Choroid Plexus (Fig. 257, 8) is a vascular fringe lying upon the surface of the thalamus, and continued into the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. It will subsequently be seen to be the edge of a process of pia mater (velum interpositum), which lies beneath the fornix. By drawing gently upon the choroid plexus of one side, it may be shown to be connected with that of the opposite side through the foramen of Monro (5), an opening beneath the fornix in the middle line. The Corpus Fimbriatum (Fig. 257, 9) is the thin edge of the fornix, which however does not present any fimbriae. [To see the fornix thoroughly, the remnant of the corpus callosum in the middle line should be cut through transversely about its centre, when the posterior part is to be carefully dissected away from the subjacent fornix.] The Fornix (Fig. 257, 10) is a thin white body placed beneath the corpus callosum in the middle line. Anteriorly it is divided into two anterior crura or pillars, which pass to the base of the brain to form the corpora albicantia, and will be afterwards seen. Posteriorly it is incorporated with the splenium of the corpus callosum, and gives off laterally the two posterior cornua, which are continuous With the corpus fimbriatum and hippocampus major. The fornix is separated from the corpus callosum in front by the septum lucidum. The lateral ventricles are separated from one another by the Septum Lucidum, a double layer of white cerebral matter, grey externally, containing the fifth ventricle, and extending between the anterior part of the corpus callosum and the fornix. It is deeper in front than behind (Fig. 263, 6). The Fifth Ventricle (Fig. 257, 2) can be shown by cutting504 INTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. through the septum lucidum with a pair of scissors close to the remains of the corpus callosum, which must he turned forward. It lies between the two layers of the septum lucidum, and is deepest in front. It is lined by a delicate membrane, which in the adult forms a shut sac, but in the foetus communicates with the subjacent third ventricle. The Foramen of Monro (Fig. 257, 5) is the communication between the two lateral and the third ventricles. It is placed beneath the anterior part of the fornix, immediately behind its anterior pillars, and the choroid plexus has already been traced to it (Fig. 263, 10). [To see the descending cornu, the side of the brain should be freely cut through opposite the point at which the choroid plexus disappears ; this being taken as the guide, the de- scending cornu can be opened along its side, and the cavity exposed by drawing the parts asunder.] The Descending or Middle Cornu (Fig. 258) takes a curved course downward in the middle lobe of the cerebrum and beneath the optic thalamus. Its direction is at first slightly backward, and then outward, downward, forward, and inward,* and it has been said to resemble a bent fore-finger. In it will be found the continuations of Fig. 258. The Hippocampus Minor (Fig. 258, 7) is a projection of variable size from the inner wall of the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, corre- sponding to the calcarine fissure. It is white on the surface but grey in the interior. * Artificial Memory, BODFI. Fig. 258.—Descending comu of tlie lateral ventricle of brain (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Pes hippocampi. 6.

The Hippocampus Major (Fig. 258, 3) is continuous with the posterior peduncle of the fornix. It is a prominent convex body cor- responding to the dentate fissure, and winds forward to the extremity of the cornu. Its anterior extremity is enlarged, and is marked with more or less distinct transverse grooves, and to this part the name Pes Hippocampi (1) has been given, from its fancied resemblance to the foot of an animal. At the anterior border of the hippocampus major is a thin band of white cerebral matter continuous with the corpus fimbriatum and therefore with the fornix, but now called the Taenia Hippocampi (Fig. 258, 2). By lifting this up with the handle of the scalpel and tinning it aside, a serrated free border of grey nervous matter will be seen, which has been called the Fascia Dentata (4). This is the grey matter of the convolution which forms the pes hippocampi, as may be seen by making a transverse section of it. The Choroid Plexus of the descending cornu is continuous with the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle, and can now be seen to be connected with the pia mater through a slit immediately in front of the tienia hippocampi (transverse fissure of Bichat). The Pes Accessorius or Eminentia Collateralis (Fig. 258, 5) is a projection of variable size at the commencement of the descend- ing cornu, and between the hippocampus major and hippocampus minor, corresponding to the collateral fissure. [By cutting through the fornix opposite the foramen of Monro, it can be carefully lifted up with the handle of the scalpel and turned backward, when some transverse markings on its under surface will be seen (from which it has been called the Lyra), and the velum interpositum beneath will be brought into view. By carefully scraping away the brain substance with the handle of the knife, the continuity of the velum interpositum with the pia mater through the great transverse fissure may be demonstrated.] The Velum Interpositum (Fig. 259, 5) is a triangular process of pia mater carried into the interior of the brain through the great transverse fissure, which is now laid open. The continuity of the pia mater may be traced upon the upper surface of the cerebellum and the under surface of the posterior lobe of the cerebrum, and it may be followed through the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle to the base of the brain, where it appears by the side of the crus cerebri (v. p. 489). At each side of the velum interpositum are the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles, and in the centre are twoINTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. 506 veins (Vence Galeni), which open into the straight sinus of the dura mater (Fig. 263, 3). The Great Transverse Fissure, or Fissure of Bichat (Fig. 253, 11) which is now opened, is the slit by which the pia mater enters the brain. It is opposite the interval between the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and reaches forward in the brain beneath the fornix and corpus callosum, and above the great ganglia of the brain (corpora striata and optic thalami). The fissure is continued downward on each side in the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle, and reaches the base of the brain at the outer side of each crus cerebri. [The velum interpositum is to be reflected, when the two small choroid plexuses of the third ventricle will be seen on its under surface. The third ventricle will now be seen, and behind it the corpora Fig. 259.—The velum interpositum, showing its continuity with the pia mater (from University College Museum). 1. Fornix divided. 2.

Its roof is formed by the fornix and velum interpositum, and its floor by the structures con- tained within the circle of Willis at the base of the brain, viz., the lamina cinerea, optic cliiasma, tuber einereum, corpora albicantia, and locus perforatus posticus (from before backwards). The anterior boundary of the ventricle is formed by the anterior commissure (5), a wrhite band between the two corpora striata, which may be seen between and in front of the two anterior pillars of the fornix ; the posterior boundary is the posterior commissure (Fig. 263, 14), a slender white band between the two optic thalami, which may be seen immediately in front of, and a little beneath, the pineal gland. Stretching across the ventricle between the two optic thalami is the middle or soft commissure (7) (frequently torn), which divides the ventricle into two portions, to which the names foramen commune anterius and foramen commune posterius are sometimes given. The third ventricle communicates with the two lateral ventricles by the foramen of Monro, and with the fourth ventricle by the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum or aqueduct of Sylvius, which passes beneath the posterior commissure, the pineal gland, and the corpora quadrigemina (Fig. 263, 16). In the foetus the third ventricle com- municated in addition with the fifth ventricle, and with the infundi- bulum (iter ad infundibulum). The Thalamus Opticus (Fig. 260, 6) is now fully exposed, and will be seen to be a large body partly white and partly grey, placed posteriorly to the corpus striatum and at the side of the third ventricle. It is the great ganglion of sensation, and has been seen to form part of the floor of the lateral ventricle by its upper surface, on which is a slight prominence called the anterior tubercle. Along the inner margin is a narrow' white band, one of the peduncles of the pineal body; and by its inner surface, which bounds the third ventricle, it gives attachment to the middle and posterior commissures of the thud ventricle, the posterior piercing its substance. The thalamus opticus forms the roof of the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle, and by drawing it upward on the side upon which the cornu has been opened, two projections on its under surface may be seen. These are the Corpora Geniculata (externum and internum)INTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. 508 of which the outer one is the larger. By turning the brain on its side the optic tract may he readily traced to the under surface of the optic thalamus, to which it is attached; and will be found to divide into two parts, which are connected with the corpora geniculata, and pass on to the corpora quadrigemina. Fig. 260. The Pineal Body or Gland (Fig. 260, io) (conarium) is a pink body of a conical shape, lying between the anterior pair of the corpora quadrigemina and above the posterior commissure of the third ventricle. Its anterior part or base is connected with the margins —Third ventricle of brain (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). Fig. 260. 1. Corpus sti'iatum dissected. 2. Fifth ventricle. 3.

The velum interpositum gives a special investment of pia mater to the gland. The pineal body contains a cavity in which are some particles of calcareous matter (acervulus). The Corpora Quadrigemina (Fig. 260,12) are four white promi- nences placed immediately behind the third ventricle, and named Nates and Testes, from their fancied resemblance to those parts ; but it is to be noted that their position is the reverse of that in man, since the two anterior bodies are the nates and the posterior the testes. Both sets of bodies are connected to the optic thalami by white bands, and the nates are also coimected to the pineal gland, which lies upon their upper surface. The two broad white bands passing from the cerebellum to the testes, are the superior peduncles of the cerebellum (processus a cere- hello ad testes) (Fig. 261, 3), and between them is a thin layer of white matter, the Valve of Vieussens (Fig. 260, 13), to which the fourth pair of nerves may be traced round the superior peduncles of the cerebellum. The band of white matter passing transversely beneath the corpora quadrigemina on each side, and seen immediately in front of the superior peduncles of the cerebellum, is the Fillet of the Olivary body (Fig. 261, 2). [Opportunity may now be taken to trace out the anterior commis- sure of the third ventricle and the anterior pillar of the fornix, by carefully scraping away the corpus striatum of one side.] The Anterior Commissure is a cylindrical white band, which may be traced through the corpus striatum to the roof of the descending cornu of the lateral, ventricle. The Anterior pillar of the Fornix descends in front of the third ventricle, and reaches the base of the brain, where it makes a twist to form the superficial white substance of the corpus albicans of one side, and then ascends to be lost in the grey matter of the optic tha- lamus (Fig. 256). t The Cerebellum. The Cerebellum (Fig. 253, 28) or small brain lies beneath the posterior lobes of the cerebrum, and in the skull is separated from them by the tentorium cerebelli. It is of a darker colour than the cerebrum, and its surface is divided into laminae instead of convolu- tions, and these are separated by shallow sulci. The cerebellum isTHE CEREBELLUM. 510 border of the testes. The two divisible into two lateral halves united by a commissure, and the horizontal fissure divides the organ into an upper and a lower part. The upper surface is flat except in Fig. 261. the median line, where there is a slight ridge forming the commissure, and called the superior vermiform process. The upper part of each hemisphere is divided into an ante- rior and a posterior lobe by an indis- tinct fissure. The anterior lobe is the larger, and of a square shape, reaching as far back as the posterior extremity of the vermiform process. The posterior lobe is the small por- tion behind the level of the vermi- form process, and reaches to the hori- zontal fissure. The cerebellum is connected to the cerebrum and spinal cord by three peduncles or crura, of which the superior one can now be seen. The Superior Peduncle (Fig. 261, 3) (processus a cerebello ad testes) is a broad, flattened white band, which is connected below with the inferior vermiform process, and passes forwards to the corpora quadrige- mina, the two peduncles of opposite sides converging at the posterior processes are prolonged beneath the Fig. 261.—Fourth ventricle and upper part of spinal cord and membranes.

The Valve of Vieussens (Fig. 260,13) (Velum medullare anterius) is the thin layer of white nervous matter stretched between the two superior peduncles of the cerebellum, and connected with the anterior extremity of the inferior vermiform process. It is narrow in front, but broader behind, where it has a little grey matter connected with it, and is often torn through, in which case the cavity of the fourth ventricle is exposed. The fourth pair of nerves arises from the middle line of the valve'close behind the corpora quadrigemina (Fig. 263,15). [The preparation is to be turned over for the examination of the remaining peduncles and of the under surface of the cerebellum.] The Middle Peduncle (Fig. 261,4) (processus a cerebello adpontem) has been already seen at the base of the brain. It is the largest of the three peduncles, and the fibres pass across the pons from one hemisphere of the cerebellum to the other, constituting the super- ficial transverse fibres of the pons, which have been already dissected. The Inferior Peduncle (Fig. 261, 5) (processus a cerebello ad medullam) forms part of the restiform body of the medulla, and will be better seen when the fourth ventricle is opened. The Inferior Surface (Fig. 262) of the cerebellum is divided into two hemispheres by a deep fissure, the vallecula, at the bottom of which is the inferior vermiform process, which is to be seen by drawing the medulla oblongata well forward. Each hemisphere is divided somewhat arbitrarily into lobes, since the divisions between them are very uncertain. Beginning behind is the Posterior Lobe (11); next the Slender Lobe (10) ; and in front of that the Biventral or Digastric Tjobe (5). The Amygdala or Tonsil (Fig. 253, 29) is a prominent lobe, close to the vallecula which it partially conceals. The Flocculus (Fig. 262, 4) is a small lobe immediately in front of the biventral lobe, which lies beneath the crus cerebelli, and is hence called the subpeduncular lobe. The Inferior Vermiform Process (Fig. 262) is divided into the following portions. Most anteriorly is the Nodule (6), which projects into the fourth ventricle; posterior to this is the thin ridge called the Uvula (7), from the fact of its lying between the two tonsils ; behind this is the Pyramid (9), and posterior to this again are a few trans- verse commissural fibres.

This is the Velum Medullare Posterius (8). [The brain being again placed with the base downward, an incision is to be made through the valve of Yieussens and the cerebellum, in order to expose fully the cavity of the fourth ventricle.] The Fourth Ventricle (Fig. 261, 6) is situated at the back of the pon3 Yarolii and the medulla oblongata, those bodies forming its floor. The roof is formed by the valve of Yieussens and the inferior vermi- Fig. 262. form process of the cerebellum ; the sides by the two superior peduncles of the cerebellum (processus ad testes) above, andbelow by the restiform body. The cavity of the ventricle is lozenge-shaped, and it communicates above with the third ventricle by the Aqueduct of Sylvius (iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum), which passes beneath the corpora quadrigemina (Fig. 263, 16). Below, the fourth ventricle is closed by a reflection of pia mater, in which there is usually an opening establishing a communication between the ventricles of the brain and the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord. Connected with this process of pia mater is the Choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle (Fig. 262, 3), which extends for some distance into the cavity.

On each side of this groove is a convex body, the fasciculus teres, which is white at the upper part of the ventricle, hut covered helow hy grey matter, and is the Fig. 263. continuation of the fibres of the lateral tract and restiform body of the medulla. There are four gangliform projections or nuclei on each side of the median groove in the floor of the ventricle. The upper one is for the sixth and facial nerves, and immediately below are some white lines Fig. 263.—Vertical longitudinal section of the brain (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

The lower nuclei are for the auditory, the eighth, and the ninth nerves. The lower extremity of the ventricle, which is hounded on each side by the enlarged extremities (processus clavati) of the Posterior Pyrajrnids of the spinal cord, has been called the calamus scriptorius, from its fancied resemblance to a pen, of which the lineae transversse form the feathers. By slicing vertically either hemisphere of the cerebellum, the appear- ing. 264. ance known as the arbor vitce (Fig. 263, 19) will be brought into view. This is due to the pecu- liar arrangement of white cerebral matter within the grey matter of the external laminae ; and by careful slicing, an irre- gular grey body (corpus dentatum) will be seen in the centre of the white matter of each hemi- sphere. By making a transverse section of the medulla oblongata a small corpus dentatum will also be seen in the olivary body of each side (Fig. 264, c). When possible, the student as soon as he has finished the above dissection, should procure another brain in order that he may make various sections of it, and so more thoroughly understand the rela- tions of the several parts. The most useful section is one made in the median plane (Fig. 263), or a little to one side of it (Fig. 257), by which most of the important parts will be exposed. .—Transverse section of Medulla oblongata magnified (after Stilling) Eig. 264 a.

In order to study the general anatomy of the globe of the eye it will be best to procure half-a-dozen bullocks’ eyes, since the parts are larger than in the human eye, which also it is difficult to procure in a sufficiently recent condition. It must be borne in mind however that the eye of the bullock differs from that of man in the following particulars ; the cornea is oval instead of being nearly circular ; the pupil is elongated into a slit instead of being a circular aperture ; the choroid coat presents the peculiar coloured appearance known as the tapetum lucidum, which is absent in man ; and the yellow spot which is present in the human retina is wanting in the eyes of quadrupeds. The following description will be of the human eye, which the student will find no difficulty in following. [All the fat and the remnants of the muscles of the eye are to be removed with scissors, the optic nerve being carefully preserved.] The Human Eyeball (Fig. 265) is nearly globular in shape, but has a portion of a smaller sphere (the cornea) projecting anteriorly, thus making its antero-posterior greater than the transverse diameter. The Sclerotic (Fig. 265, n) or external tunic is composed of dense white fibrous tissue, and serves to maintain the shape of the eyeball and to protect the internal parts. It is thicker behind than in front, and is pierced posteriorly by the optic nerve, which enters at a distance of about its own breadth to the inner side of the axis of the eyeball. The opening in the sclerotic for the optic nerve is funnel-shaped, and the fibrils of the nerve pass through a fine fibrous tissue which has been named lamina cribrosa from its numerous aper- tures, one of which in the centre for the arteria centralis retince has been called the poms opticus. The sclerotic is pierced at various points by the ciliary vessels and nerves. In front, the sclerotic gives insertion to the recti muscles, from which it receives an expansion (tunica albuginea), and in front of this point the conjunctiva is re- L L 2516 THE EYEBALL. fleeted upon its surface, but can be readily stripped up as far as the margin of the cornea. The sclerotic overlaps the margin of the cornea as the case of a watch does the watch-glass, and encroaches upon it slightly above and below. The sclerotic and the cornea are inseparably united, the tissue of the two structures being continuous. By squeezing the eyeball between the finger and thumb the cornea Fig. 265. will be rendered white and opaque, but will resume its former appearance wheD the pressure is relaxed. The Cornea (Fig. 265, i) is one of the transparent media of the eye; and in man is perfectly circular when seen from within, but appears wider transversely from without, on account of the greater overlapping of the sclerotic above and below. The curvature of the cornea varies in different individuals, but the anterior and posterior surfaces are always parallel. The cornea is divisible into five layers: 1, anterior epithelium (conjunctiva) ; 2, anterior elastic lamina ; 3, cornea proper ; 4, posterior elastic lamina ; 5, posterior epithelium (of aqueous humour). The cornea in health is a non-vascular structure, no blood-vessels ^existing in it and its Fig-. 265.—Longitudinal section of the eye (drawn by H. Power). 1. Cornea. 2. Iris. 3.

Minute branches of the ciliary nerves have however been traced into and through it. [Holding the eye lightly with the left hand, the scalpel is to be thrust through the margin of the cornea into the anterior chamber, when the aqueous humour will necessarily escape. With scissors the cornea may then be removed entirely.] The Anterior Chamber (Fig. 265, 3) is the space between the cornea and the iris. It communicates with the posterior chamber through the pupil, and is filled with the aqueous humour. The Iris (Fig. 265, 2) is the highly vascular curtain which separates the anterior from the posterior chamber. It is composed of involun- tary muscular fibres, blood-vessels, and pigment, and may be con- sidered to be a prolongation of the choroid coat. In man the pigment of the iris is of various colours, but it is absent altogether in albinos, and occasionally the iris itself is wanting. The Pupil is a circular opening (in man) in the centre of the iris, which varies in size according to the contraction of the tissue of the iris under the influ- ence of light. The Posterior Chamber is smaller than the anterior, and can be hardly said to exist when the aqueous humour has been let out. It is between the iris and the anterior layer of the capsule of the lens. [In order to see the choroid coat entire, a fresh eye should be taken, and a puncture having been made through the sclerotic, about its middle, a blowpipe is to be introduced, through which air may be forced between the sclerotic and choroid coats, and they will thus be separated from one another. The sclerotic may then be cautiously divided circularly, and the posterior cup-like portion of the sclerotic being left as a support to the eye, the anterior part (with the cornea) is to be carefully detached from the choroid. In order to do this it will be necessary to scrape the interior of the sclerotic with the handle of the scalpel, in order to tear through the ciliary muscle which attaches the choroid to the sclerotic coat.] The Choroid Coat (Fig. 266, 3) is a vascular structure containing pigment, expanded over the whole of the posterior portion of the globe of the eye and continuous in front with the iris. It is pierced by the optic nerve, at which point it is closely connected to the sclerotic ; but is attached to the inner surface of that coat only by a delicate fibrous tissue, called the membrane, fusee1. On the outer surface of the choroid may be seen (in an injected specimen) the loops of blood-vessels; the name vasa vorticose has been given to the veins; the arteries are derived from the ciliary 1 (ranches of the518 THE EYEBALL. ophthalmic. Within this is the tunica Ruyscliiana, a plexus ot capillaries. The dark pigment of the choroid is interspersed among the vessels, and is washed out when the eye is immersed in water. is the Ciliary Muscle (Fig. 265,8), composed of unstriped fibre and hav- ing a grey appearance. The anterior part of the ciliary muscle is con- nected with the sclerotic coat, and the posterior part is attached to that portion of the choroid which is called the ciliary body, and from which the ciliary processes pass inwards to be connected with the capsule of the lens. Thus the ciliary muscle, by drawing forward the anterior part of the choroid, relaxes the suspensory ligament of the lens and allows its own elasticity to come into play, in consequence of which the lens increases in thickness in order to accommodate the focus of the eye to near objects. [In order to see the ciliary body and processes, a third eye should be divided circularly through the sclerotic and choroid coats, without damaging the vitreous humour ; the vitreous humour and lens are then to be carefully separated from the anterior part of the choroid, the ciliary processes being detached from the hyaloid membrane, upon which they will leave a circle marked with more or less pigment (circle of Zinn). The ciliary processes and iris are now seen from behind. If the lens and vitreous humour be drawn out of the fundus of an eye and left attached to the ciliary processes, a magnified view of these will be obtained.] Surrounding the iris is a ring which Fig. 266.

These are vascular fringes which resemble a series of plaits in appearance, and which form a circular curtain parallel but posterior to the iris, from which they are separated by the posterior chamber. They fit into a corresponding series of grooves in the hyaloid membrane of the vitreous humour, and together constitute the ciliary zone. Between the anterior margin of the sclerotic and the ciliary body is a minute canal, which runs round the entire circumference of the eye and is called the Canal of Fontana (Fig. 265, 5). [The lens will be seen on the posterior half of this section, or may be shown on the first eye by carefully removing the iris.] The Lens (Fig. 265, 4) is situ- ated in front of the vitreous humour, and is contained in a delicate and perfectly transparent capsule, which is united behind with the hyaloid membrane of the vitreous! humour. The cap- sule is kept in its place by the suspensory ligament of the lens, a trans- parent membrane which passes from the ciliary processes to the capsule in front of the hyaloid membrane. By tearing through the capsule (as in the operation for extraction of cataract), its existence will be demonstrated and the lens itself allowed to escape. The lens is bi-convex, but the posterior surface has a greater curve than the anterior. It is perfectly transparent in health, but has a complicated structure consisting .of fibres arranged around three axes running in different directions, of which indications are usually visible in the bullock’s eye. The exterior of the lens readily breaks down, but the interior or nucleus is very dense. The Canal of Petit (Fig. 265, 6) is a minute space surrounding Fig. 267.—Anterior half of the ey< 1.

The anterior border of the retina (ora serrata)..520 THE EYEBALL. the lens immediately around the capsule, and is hounded in front by the suspensory ligament and behind by the hyaloid membrane. The Vitreous Humour (Fig. 265, 13) is the transparent body tilling all the posterior part of the eyeball. It is a gelatinous sub- stance contained in a transparent membrane called the hyaloid membrane, and is traversed by numerous delicate and perfectly transparent septa. The existence of these may be demonstrated by crushing the vitreous humour with the fingers, when the 11 uid portion will drain away. In the eye from which the vitreous humour has been removed the retina will fall together, leaving the inner surface of the choroid exposed, and in the bullock’s eye the tapetum luculum will be seen. This is the coloured appearance which is peculiar to the lower animals, and is due to the presence of a thick layer of wavy fibrous tissue outside the choroidal epithelium. The object of this is to reflect the rays through the retina a second time, and thus to enable the animal to see with a very small amount of light. [The retina is best seen by looking through the vitreous humour of an eye from which the iris and lens have been removed.] The Retina (Fig. 265, 9) is the nervous coat of the eye and its essential part. It lines the choroid coat, being connected posteriorly with the optic nerve, and extends in front nearly as far forward as the ciliary body, where it terminates about one-eighth of an inch behind the margin of the cornea in a finely jagged border, the ora serrata, being thicker behind than in front. During life the retina is transparent, so that the vascular choroid can be seen through it with the ophthalmoscope, but after death it has a greyish colour and is thrown into folds, owing to the diminution of the tension of the globe. The entrance of the optic nerve may be seen about one-tenth of an inch to the inner side of the axis of the eye, and radiating from this may be seen the branches of the arteria centralis retince, which enters the eye at this point, and its accompanying veins. In the axis of the eyeball in the human eye is the yellow spot of Soemmering, the most sensitive point, which consists of a small elevation, in the centre of which is a minute depression, the fovea centralis. The retina (Fig. 269) consists of eight layers with two delicate limiting membranes, which are as follows, beginning from the inner surface:—a. The membrana limitans interna. 1. The fibrous layer continuous with the optic nerve (the fibrillse of which here lose their white substance of Schwann), and having numerous ganglionic cells521 THE RETINA. and nuclei developed in it. 2. The ganglionic layer consisting of nerve cells of spheroidal or pyriform shape. 3. The inner molecular layer. 4. The inner nuclear layer consisting of transparent nucleus-like bodies. 5. The outer molecular layer much thinner than the inner one. 6. The outer nuclear layer. b. The membrana limitans exter- na. 7. The outer layer or Jacob’s membrane consists of a peculiar arrangement of particles to which the names rods and cones Fig. 268. have been given. These rods are continuous with some fibres which pierce the whole depth of the retina, and are called the fibres of Muller. 8.

GEORGE HENRY FOX’S PHOTOGRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS OP SKIN DISEASES, (60 Cases from Life,) AND THE SAME AUTHOR'S PHOTOGRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS OF CUTANEOUS SYPHILIS (70 Cases from Life). As one of the Suvgeons to the New York Dispensary, in charge of the Skin and Venereal Department, where upwards of five thousand cases are treated annually, the Author has had an ample amount of clinical mate- rial from which to select cases. Through the kindness of physicians in charge of the Skin Clinics he has had the advantage of drawing largely from other Dispensaries and Hospitals in New York and Brooklyn. The Colouring is a special feature, and has been entrusted to a skil- ful anatomical artist, J. GAERTNER, M.D., formerly a physician and student under Hebra, in the General Hospital of Vienna. These plates are carefully coloured by hand, and more accurately represent disease than any lithographs or coloured photographs which have ever been offered to the profession. Each work contains 18 Quarto Plates, with Descriptive Text, half- bound. The price of each work is Five Guineas. The Medical Times and Gazette says of the Flates :—“ All are good, and some are most admirable and excellent life-like representations of disease.” The Edinburgh Medical Journal says:—“On the whole, this collection of photographs is of great excellence, and the work will be of the utmost value to all practitioners of medicine. The British Medical Journal says:—“ These very excellent photographs carry the art of photographic representation of pathological appearances further and higher than any which we have yet seen. The subjects are well-selected ; the photographs are excellent; and the colouring life-like and restrained from excess of violence in tone. They are very successful, and will undoubtedly be popular. Dr. Fox is a highly-educated dermatologist, and his text is excellent.”London: J. & A. CHURCHILL.

With 48 plates (112 figures), exhibiting in colour the Muscles, Arteries, Veins, and Nerves. Imp. 4to ; and a volume of Explanatory Text, with many Engravings. 400 pp. Svo, £4 14s. fid. ' “ There is probably no other atlas published which is entirely the work of one man—dissections, drawing, and text. This is the case in the work before us, and Mr. Godlee is therefore to be specially congratulated in his threefold capa- city of anatomist, artist, and author. We must express our great satisfaction with the work. It will doubtless become as popular as any of its predecessors, and will possess over them the advantage of having been executed by one who is an anatomist as well as a surgeon.”—Medical Times and Gazette. “ A most excellent guide to the student.”—Lancet. “ The extreme value of the plates has been again and again testified to us by students who have derived the surest assistance from them.”—Student's Journal.

It is generally admitted that there is a want in this country of a good text-book on Applied Anatomy, not a mere Handbook. By means of the sections found in this Atlas the exact position and the relations of the structures which must be divided or avoided inThe-- course of an operation are indicated, and the track of a bullet or puncture wound suggested ; at the same time they afEord an absolutely correct representation of the intimate relations of the viscera of the thorax and abdomen. “ It will speedilybe found in the hands of every advanced anatomical student, and is absolutely indispensable to the anatomical teacher and to every surgeon, whether in military or civil practice. . . . The translation is extremely well done.”—The Lancet. The finest anatomical work that has been published in this country for a long time.”—Student's Jour. “ Mr. Bellamy has been happily inspired in introducing to the British surgeon and anatomist this most valuable atlas.”—Brit.

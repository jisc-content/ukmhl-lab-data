THE PELVIS. 260 line (18), ■which can he more or less distinctly seen stretching in a curve across the obturator foramen. This marks the point where the pelvic fascia divides into two parts, the redo-vesical and the obturator layers, and also forms a part of the origin of the levator ani muscle, the fibres of which can be indistinctly seen through the obturator fascia. The obturator layer (13) can now be seen passing downwards on the Fig. 145. inner side of the obturator internus muscle, to be attached to the spine and tuberosity of the ischium and great sacro-sciatic ligament, where it gives a covering to the pudic vessels and nerve ; and to the rami of the ischium and pubes, passing beneath the origin of the levator ani to the apex of the pubic arch (Godlee). A little above its attachment to the pubic arch it gives off a process which passes across Fig. 145.—Transverse section of the pelvis, seen from behind, showing the distiibution of the pelvic fascia (from Wilson). 1. Bladder. 2. Yesicula seminalis of left side, divided. 3. .Rectum. 4. Iliac fascia, covering in the iliacus and psoas (5) ; and forming a sheath for the external iliac vessels (6). 7. Anterior crural nerve excluded from the sheath. 8. Pelvic fascia, splitting into the rec- to-vesical and obturator layers. 9.Recto-vesical layer, foiming the lateral ligament of the bladder of one side, and a sheath to the vesical plexus of veins. 10. A layer of fascia passing between the bladder and rectum. 11. A layer passing round the rectum. 12. Levator ani. 13. Obturator internus, covered in by the obturator fascia, which also forms a sheath for the internal pudic vessels and nerve (14). 15. Anal fascia investing the under surface of the levator ani.

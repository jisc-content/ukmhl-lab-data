418 LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAS. the arytaenoid cartilages and with the arytaeno-epiglottidean folds. They are composed of yellow fihro-cartilage. The Cuneiform Cartilages or Cartilages of Wrisberg (Fig. 216, rj) are two small bodies found in the arytaeno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane, and are sometimes wanting. They are com- posed of yellow fibro-cartilage. The Epiglottis (Fig. 216, a) is composed of yellow fibro-cartilage, shaped like a cordate leaf, and has been seen to be connected with the thyroid cartilage and the hyoid bone. It is covered with mucous membrane, upon removing which it will be found to be perforated, especially in the posterior aspect, by numerous holes, in which mucous glands are lodged. The large cartilages of the larynx are very apt to undergo calcareous degeneration in advanced life, and the epiglottis is not unfrequently thickened by disease or injured by ulceration. Ligaments of the Vertebras. [The ligaments of the spinal column are to be examined by re- moving all the remaining muscular fibres.] The Ligaments of the Bodies of the vertebrae are—1, the Anterior Common Ligament; 2, the Posterior Common Ligament; and 3, the Intervertebral Substance or Fibro-cartilage. The Anterior Common Ligament (Fig. 218, i) is a broad band of fibres extending down the front of the vertebral column, from the axis to the sacrum. The fibres are attached princi- pally to the intervertebral substances, and only slightly to the upper and lower margins of the vertebrae ; the deep fibres passing between the adjacent bones, but the superficial crossing three or more vertebrae. The ligament when divided will be seen to be thicker opposite the bodies of the vertebrae than on the inter- Fig. 218.

The continuity of the greater with the lesser bag is thus evident, and the foramen of Winslow is seen to he merely the narrowed tube of communication between the two cavities. Besides the folds of peritoneum which have been named in tracing Fig 109. the membrane, there are others which form certain ligaments of the liver and bladder, and of the uterus in the female. Passing from the umbilicus to the Liver the obliterated umbilical vein or round ligament is seen, and around it is reflected a double fold of peritoneum, the suspensory or falciform ligament of the liver. This is prolonged on each side over the diaphragm and on to the upper surface of the liver, where it forms the upper layer of the coronary ligament; the under layer being formed partly by the lesser bag of the peritoneum, and the triangular surface between the two Fig. 109.—Female pelvic organs, seen from above (from Savage). a. a.

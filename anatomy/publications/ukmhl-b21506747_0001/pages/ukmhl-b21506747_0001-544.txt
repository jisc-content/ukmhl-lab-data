Within this again is a longitudinal layer of elastic fibres closely con- nected with the mucous membrane, the epithelium of which is columnar and ciliated. On looking into the lower end of the trachea, a slight septum will be seen between the two bronchi but placed to the left of the median line, thus favouring the passage of foreign bodies into the right bronchus, the orifice of which is seen to be larger than that of the [The trachea and bronchi are to be laid open from behind with scissors, and the divisions of the bronchi should be followed for a short distance into the substance of the lungs.] The Lungs.—The mucous membrane of the air tubes is of a pinkish colour and has ciliated epithelium. Numerous mucous glands are embedded in the submucous areolar tissue. On tracing the bronchi they will be found to divide (for the most Fig. 239.—Two primary pulmonary lobuli or infundibula (from Frey). a, a. Exterior of lobuli. b, b. Pulmonary vesicles. c, c.

465 THE COSTO-TRANSVERSE LIGAMENTS. the vertebra above ; the middle fasciculus to the intervertebral sub- stance ; the inferior fasciculus to the vertebra below. The whole ligament is closely connected with the anterior common ligament of the vertebrae. This arrangement only holds good in the case of those ribs which articulate with two vertebra. In the case of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, which articulate with a single vertebra each, the stellate ligament is attached principally to that vertebra, but sends a few fibres to the vertebra above. The Capsular Ligament is a thin layer of fibres surrounding the articulation where the anterior ligament is wanting. The Interarticular Ligament (Fig. 242, 4) is seen by removing the stellate ligament, and is a short band passing between the ridge on the head of the rib and the intervertebral substance. It divides the articulation into two parts, each of which has a separate synovial membrane, but it is absent from the articulations of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, which have a single synovial membrane. 2. The Costo-transverse ligaments are Anterior, Posterior, and Middle. Fig. 244. The Anterior Costo-transverse Ligament (Fig. 242, 3) is attached to the upper border of the neck of all the ribs except the first, and ascends to the lower border of the transverse process of the vertebra above. It separates the anterior from the posterior division of the intercostal nerves. The Posterior Costo-transverse Ligament (Fig. 242, 4) is a short thick band, passing obliquely upward from the apex of the Fig. 244.â€”Transverse section of dorsal vertebra and ribs (Quain). 1.

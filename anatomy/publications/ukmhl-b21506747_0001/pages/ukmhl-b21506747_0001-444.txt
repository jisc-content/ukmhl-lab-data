362 THE .PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGION. Temporo-Maxillary Articulation.—The external lateral liga- ment (Fig. 192, 5) is a short thick hand of fibres broader above than below, and passes obliquely downwards and backwards from the lower border of the root of the zygoma to the neck of the jaw. It is continuous with the capsular ligament, which is attached to the margins of the articular surfaces, and is sometimes described as con- sisting of anterior, posterior, and internal portions. By dividing the ligaments, the inter-articular cartilage and the synovial membranes above and below it will be brought into view. The inter-articular fibro-cartilage (Fig. 193, 3) is seen to fit into the glenoid cavity, and its upper surface is accordingly concavo-convex from before backwards, the lower surface being concave. The cartilage, together with the condyle, being detached from the temporal bone and turned forward with the external pterygoid muscle, will be found to be oval in outline and thicker at the margins than in the centre, which is occasionally perforated. The internal lateral ligament (Fig. 194, 4) now fully exposed, is a membranous band, narrow above, where it is attached to the spine of the sphenoid bone and is crossed by the internal maxillary artery, and widening below to be attached to the projecting margin of the dental foramen. It is covered by the inferior dental nerve and artery at Fig. 191.—The two pterygoid muscles (from Wilson). The zygomatic arch and the greater part of the ramus of the lower jaw have been removed in order to bring the muscles into view. 1. The sphenoid origin of the external 2.

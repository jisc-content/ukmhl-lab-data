422 LIGAMENTS OF THE ATLAS, AXIS, AND OCCIPUT. The Posterior Occipito-Atlantal Ligament (Fig. 222, 3) re- sembles the ligamenta subflava, hut is composed of white fibrous tissue. It is thin and membranous, and is attached above to the posterior margin of the foramen magnum, and below to the posterior arch of the atlas. On each side this ligament is perforated by the vertebral artery and suboccipital nerve, over which some of its fibres arch. The Lateral Occipito-Atlantal Ligaments (Fig. 222,4)are short strong bands, passing between the roots of the transverse processes of the atlas and the jugular processes of the occipital bone. Fig. 222. Fig. 223. The Anterior Atlanto-Axial Ligament (Fig. 221, 4) resembles the anterior occipito-atlantal ligament, and consists of a superficial and a deep portion. The superficial portion is round, and is continuous with the anterior common ligament, being attached to the anterior tubercle of the atlas and the body of the axis. The deep portion is broad and thin, and extends from the anterior arch of the atlas to the body of the axis.

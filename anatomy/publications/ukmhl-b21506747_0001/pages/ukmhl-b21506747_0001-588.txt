INTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. 506 veins (Vence Galeni), which open into the straight sinus of the dura mater (Fig. 263, 3). The Great Transverse Fissure, or Fissure of Bichat (Fig. 253, 11) which is now opened, is the slit by which the pia mater enters the brain. It is opposite the interval between the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and reaches forward in the brain beneath the fornix and corpus callosum, and above the great ganglia of the brain (corpora striata and optic thalami). The fissure is continued downward on each side in the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle, and reaches the base of the brain at the outer side of each crus cerebri. [The velum interpositum is to be reflected, when the two small choroid plexuses of the third ventricle will be seen on its under surface. The third ventricle will now be seen, and behind it the corpora Fig. 259.â€”The velum interpositum, showing its continuity with the pia mater (from University College Museum). 1. Fornix divided. 2. Corpus striatum. 3. Yenae Galeni. 4. Thalamus opticus. 5. Velum interpositum. 6. Choroid plexus. 7. Left fomis reflected showing lyr.i. 8. Pia mater on under surface of cerebrum, continuous with 10.

FORAMEN OF WINSLOW. 211 Beginning at the median line of the abdominal wall, the perito- neum may be traced to the right iliac region, where it will be found to cover the front of the caecum and ascending colon (form- ing the meso-ccecum and ascending meso-colon) ; it then forms the mesentery around the small intestine, any portion of which will serve to show it; and lastly, covering the sigmoid flexure of the colon {sigmoid meso-colon) it is brought round again to the abdominal wall. A fold attaching the top of the descending colon to the under surface of the diaphragm (costo-colic, Jenner) should be noticed, since it passes below the spleen and influences the movements of that organ. Fig. 108. Above the colon the arrangement is a little complicated by the existence of the two sacs, the continuity of which however may thus be traced (Fig. 108). Beginning at the median line of the abdominal wall, the peritoneum may be traced into the right hypochondrium and over the right kidney; it then passes through the loop of the hepatic artery (foramen Winslowii), and across the body in front of the pancreas, then to the posterior surface of the stomach and back to the foramen again, where it forms the posterior layer of the lesser omentum. Reflected at this point upon itself, the membrane will be seen to form the anterior layer of the lesser omentum and to be con- Fig. 108.â€”Transverse section of the abdomen at the level of the foramen of Winslow (drawn by J.

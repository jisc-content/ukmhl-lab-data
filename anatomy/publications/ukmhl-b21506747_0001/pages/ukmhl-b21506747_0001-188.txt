104 INNER SIDE OF THE THIGH. the adductor brevis, and the gracilis, giving off a few cutaneous branches and an articular branch to the hip joint. The deep division pierces the obturator externus and lies on the adductor magnus, both of which it supplies, and gives an articular branch through the adductor magnus to the back of the knee, which affords one explanation of the pain referred to the knee in disease of the hip-joint. An Accessory obturator nerve is occasionally found passing from the third and fourth nerves of the lumbar plexus over the pubes beneath the pectineus. When this exists it more or less replaces the super- ficial division of the obturator nerve. The Adductor Magnus (Fig. 49, 20) arises from the lower part of the descending ramus of the pubes ; from the ascending ramus of the ischium ; and from the lower part of the tuberosity.

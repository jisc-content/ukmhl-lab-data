MALE PELVIC VISCERA. 278 The Corpus Spongiosum Urethrae (Fig. 152, 20) is seen between the two corpora cavernosa penis, and behind the point where these bodies cease will be seen the bulb (21), from which any remains of the accelerator urinfe muscle should be removed. Behind the bulb is the slender membranous portion (10) of the urethra terminating Fig. 152. at the prostate (7), the under surface of which is now exposed with the vesiculce seminales (9), vasa cleferentia, and base of the bladder. On each side of the membranous portion of the urethra may be found, by careful dissection, a little yellow body of the size of a pea, Cowpeds gland (11), the duct of which opens into the bulbous portion of the urethra.

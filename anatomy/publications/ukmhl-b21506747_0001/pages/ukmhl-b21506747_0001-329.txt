A probe being passed from the duodenum into the duct (canal of Wirsung), it should be dissected out, and will be found to pass along the whole length of the gland, and nearer the posterior than the anterior surface, a large accessory duct passing from the head. The pancreatic lies close to the bile duct, and the two pierce the duodenal wall together, opening usually by a common orifice. Occasionally there is a separate duct from the head of the pancreas opening into the duodenum by itself. The pancreas derives its blood from the splenic and from the superior and inferior pan- creatico-duodenal arteries ; its nerves from the solar plexus. The Spleen (Fig. 113, 4) is purple in colour and somewhat oval in form, and has a convex and a concave surface, with an anterior border which is sharp and slightly notched, and a posterior border which is thicker. On the concave surface is a vertical fissure, the hilum, into which the splenic vessels should be traced. Beneath the Fig. 131.—Arterial twig of the splenic artery, showing the connection of the splenic corpuscles with the small vessels. From the spleen of the dog (from Wilson, after Kolliker).

THE THORAX. 454 Fig. 235. The Vena Azygos Major (Fig. 236, 15) commences in one of the lumbar veins, and is to be traced through the aortic orifice of the dia- phragm. It lies to the right of the thoracic duct upon the vertebrae, cross- ing the right intercostal arteries, and receiving directly or indirectly all the right intercostal veins except the first. About the level of the seventh dorsal vertebra it receives the vena azygos minor, passing from the left side be- hind the aorta, and very generally a vertebra or two higher receives the vena azygos superior from the left side. It lastly arches forward over the right bronchus, and after receiving the right bronchial vein, opens into the superior vena cava just outside the pericar- dium. Frequently the superior inter- costal vein communicates with the vena azygos close to its termina- tion. The azygos veins contain some im- perfect valves, and form an important communication between the superior and inferior venre cavae. The Right Pneumo - Gastric Nerve (Fig. 233, 6) has been seen to enter the thorax between the sub- Fig. 235.â€”The course and termination of the thoracic duct (from Wilson). 1. Arch of the aorta. 2.

THE SUBMAXILLARY REGION. 374 1. The Hyoid (13) branch runs along the upper border of the hyoid bone. 2. The Dorsalis lingiue (3) ascends beneath the hyo-glossus to the dorsum of the tongue. 3. The Sublingucd (8) generally of good size, comes off at the anterior margin of the hyo-glossus, and is directed to the chin across the genio-hyo-glossus, which muscle it supplies, together with the sublingual gland. 4. The Ranine (2) is the termination of the lingual artery, and after leaving the genio-hyo-glossus enters the under surface of the tongue, to be continued in its substance to the tip, where it anasto- moses with the vessel of the opposite side. Surgery.—The lingual artery can be most conveniently tied in the triangle formed by the two bellies of the digastric and the hypo- glossal nerve, by dividing the fibres of the hyo-glossus horizontally near the hyoid bone. A curved incision from the symphysis menti to near the angle of the jaw, reaching to the level of the hyoid bone, will expose the lower border of the submaxillary gland, which must be drawn upwards so as to expose the digastric muscle.

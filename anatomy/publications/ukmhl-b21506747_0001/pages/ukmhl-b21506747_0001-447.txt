365 THE INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. the front teeth, appears on the face at the mental foramen with the third division of the 5th nerve. Immediately before entering the dental foramen it gives off the mylo-hyoid branch, winch pierces the Fig. 195. internal lateral ligament with a nerve of the same name, and runs in a groove on the internal surface of the lower jaw to the cutaneous surface of the mylo-hyoid and to the digastric muscle, joining the submental artery. b. The Middle meningeal artery (Fig. 195, 7) ascends beneath the external pterygoid muscle, which must be turned forwards with the Fig. 195.—The internal maxillary artery (from University College Museum). 1.

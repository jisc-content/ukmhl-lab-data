351 MUSCLES OF THE FACE. sorii (io). Professor Ellis has described similar attachments to the lower jaw close to the canine teeth. The Levator Labii Superiors Proprius (Fig. 186, 9) arises from the superior maxilla and margin of the malar hone above the infra-orbital foramen, and is inserted into the upper lip externally to the slip from the common eleva The Levator Anguli Ori fossa of the superior maxilla immediately below the infra- orbital foramen, and passes downwards and outwards be- neath the preceding muscle to the angle of the mouth, joining the fibres of the orbi- cularis. The Zygomaticus (Fig. 186) is either a single muscle, or has two slips forming the zygomaticus major and minor. The Zygomaticus major (11) arises from the malar bone close to its junction with the zygoma, and passes obliquely to the angle of the mouth, where it blends with the orbi- cularis oris. (Fig. 186) arises from the canine Fig. 186. Fig. 186.â€”Muscles of the head and face (from Wilson). 1. Frontal portion of the occipito- frontalis. 2. Its occipital portion. 3. Its aponeurosis. 4.

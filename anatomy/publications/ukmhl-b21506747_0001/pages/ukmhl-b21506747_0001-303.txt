THE VENA PORT.R. 221 common hepatic duct, which is joined at an acute angle by the duct of the gall-bladder (cystic), thus forming the common bile duct or ductus communis choledochus. The bile duct lies between the layers of the lesser omentum to the right of the hepatic artery and portal Fig. 113. 19 21 23 22 20 IS 16 vein, and passes behind the first portion of the duodenum to join the pancreatic duct and open into the duodenum as described above. The Vena Portse (Fig. 114, g) is formed by the junction of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins behind the pancreas, about an inch and a half from the head and immediately in front of the vena cava, to the right of the median line. It is four inches long, and Fig. 113.â€”Duodenum (altered from Hirsehfeld and Leveille). 1. Round ligament of liver, 2. Great end of stomach (cut). 3. Gall-bladder. 4. Spleen. 5. Hepatic artery. 6.

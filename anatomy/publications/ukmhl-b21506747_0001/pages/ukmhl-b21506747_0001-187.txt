THE OBTURATOR NERVE. Fig. 49. Hirschfeld ancl Leveille). 103 26. Gracilis. [The adductor brevis is to be divided m order to expose the deep portion of the obturator nerve, the adductor ruagnus, and the obtu- rator externus, which are to be cleaned.] The Profunda Vein receives branches corresponding to those of the artery and ends in the femoral vein, being superficial to the pro- funda artery throughout. The Obturator Nerve (Fig. 49, 8) is the last branch of the lumbar plexus, being derived from the third and fourth lumbar nerves. It leaves the pelvis at the upper part of the obturator foramen with the obturator ar- tery, and immediately divides into superficial and deep por- tions. The superficial division lies upon the adductor brevis and supplies the adductor longus, Fig. 49.â€”Nerves of the thigh (from 1. Gangliated cord of sympathetic. 2. Third lumbar nerve. 3.

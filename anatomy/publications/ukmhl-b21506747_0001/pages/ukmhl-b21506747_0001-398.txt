THE ORBIT. 316 The first thing seen on opening the orbit is the Periosteum, which is detached from the triangle of bone, and will be seen to be continuous with the dura mater of the skull through the sphenoidal fissure and the optic foramen. At the margin of the orbit the periosteum splits into two layers ; one, which is continuous around the margin with the external periosteum of the skull, and the other, which forms the palpebral ligament of each eyelid. The periosteum being divided in the centre and carefully turned ■ aside, and some soft fat removed, three nerves and two arteries are brought into view—the frontal nerve [5th] with the supra-orhital artery in the centre, the lachrymal nerve and artery on the outer side, and the little fourth nerve on the inner side; the lachrymal gland is also seen. The Fourth Nerve (Fig. 169, 13) (trochlearis or patheticus) has Fjg. 169. Fig. 169.—Superficial dissection of the nerves of the orbit (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Supra-trochlear nerve. 2.

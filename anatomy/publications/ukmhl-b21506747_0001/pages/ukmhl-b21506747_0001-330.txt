248 VISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN, peritoneal coat which invests the organ will he found a fibrous coat, which is also continued into the splenic substance, forming the trabecula or meshes in which the splenic pul'll is contained. In this pulp, which consists of a reticulum of branched connective-tissue corpuscles (Quain), are found the Malpighian corpuscles which are special to the spleen, and are small vesicular bodies containing white semi-fluid matter, attached to the minute divisions of the splenic artery (Fig. 131). They are composed of lymphoid tissue derived from a transformation of the external or areolar coat of the small arteries, and average ^ inch in diameter. The arteries end in capillaries, which lose themselves in the connective tissue of the pulp, in the interstices of which the blood flows. The veins anastomose freely in and upon the trabeculae, and open into the splenic vein (Fig. 132). The Liver (Fig. 133) presents an upper and an under surface united by a thick posterior and a thin anterior margin. Its ordinary Fig. 133. measurements are, twelve inches across, six from before backwards, and three inches in thickness ; its weight is about fifty ounces avoirdupois. The upper surface is divided into two unequal parts, of which the right is the larger, by the attachment of the falciform Fig. 133.â€”Upper surface of the liver (from Wilson). 1. Right lobe. 2.

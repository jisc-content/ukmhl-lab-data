150 FRONT OF THE LEG AND FOOT. are inserted into the bases of the first phalanges in such a manner as to abduct from an imaginary line through the second (or long) toe. Thus the 1st is inserted into the inner side of the first phalanx of the second toe ; the 2nd into the outer side of the first phalanx of the Fig. 77. Fig. 78. second toe ; the 3rd and 4th into the outer sides of the first phalanges of the third and fourth toes. The three 'plantar interossei (Fig. 78) arise from the inner sides of the third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal bones, and are inserted into the corresponding sides of the first phalanges of the same toes. They thus act as adductors towards the second toe. The interossei are supplied by the deep branch of the external plantar nerve, except those in the fourth space, which are supplied by the superficial part of the nerve. The interossei of the foot should be compared with those of the hand, in which they are a little more complicated owing to their Fig. 77.—The Dorsal Interosseous muscles of the Foot (J. T. Gray). The figures refer to the seven synovial membranes. Fig. 78.—The Plantar Interosseous muscles (J. T. Gray).

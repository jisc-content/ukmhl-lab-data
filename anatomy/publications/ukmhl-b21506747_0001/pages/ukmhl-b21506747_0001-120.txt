36 BACK OF THE ARM. the ulna, and also into the deep fascia of the fore-arm attached along the outer border of that process. A small bursa intervenes between the tendon and the tip of the olecranon process, which will be seen when the joint is opened. The triceps is the great extensor of the fore-arm upon the upper arm, and its action is that of a force applied to a lever of the first order. The long head also adducts and draws back- wards the humerus. It is supplied by the musculo- spiral nerve. [The long head being hooked to the inner side, and the musculo-spiral nerve having been put on the stretch, the fibres of the outer head are to be divided sufficiently to fol- low the nerve, with the superior profunda artery, round the bone.] The Musculo-spiral Nerve (Fig. 11, 9) has been already shown (p. 17) to be a branch of the pos- terior cord of the brachial plexus, and has been seen to disappear between the internal and middle heads of the triceps ; it can now be followed in the oblique groove on the back of the humerus between the inner and outer heads of the muscle, until it reaches the interval between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus. It gives off numerous large branches to the triceps in its course, and Fig. 12.â€”A section through the middle of the right upper arm (altered from Beraud). 1. Biceps. 2. Cephalic vein. 3.

PART II. DISSECTION OE THE LEG. [The Student is requested to read the ‘ Introduction ’ before commencing the dissection, unless he has done so previously.] Before beginning the actual dissection, the student should make himself fully acquainted with the external configuration of the part and the relations which superficial appearances hear to deeper struc- tures. If he has already dissected this region he should also make the incisions necessary to expose the several arteries in the positions in which they are usually tied, according to the directions which accom- pany the description of each vessel, taking care not to disturb the tissues unnecessarily, and to stitch up the incisions without delay. External appearances.—The fold of the groin separates the abdomen from the thigh, and the finger, if carried along it, will recognise Poupart’s ligament stretched tightly across, when the limb is fully extended. In the same position also the front of the thigh will be convex owing to the large extensor muscles, but if the knee be slightly bent and the thigh abducted, a shallow depression will be seen immediately below the groin corresponding to Scarpa’s triangle, and Poupart’s ligament will be felt to become relaxed. Lymphatic glands of variable size can be felt along, or a little above the line of Poupart’s ligament; whilst below it, and more or less in a vertical direction, will be found others which belong strictly to the thigh. In the centre of the hollow on the front of the thigh can be felt the femoral artery, which may be followed for about a third of the length of the thigh in a thin subject. A subcutaneous vein (saphena) is occasionally to be seen, when enlarged, on the inner side of the limb, and the course of others joining it is occasionally visible. If the body should be the subject of femoral hernia, probably the hernial tumor will be found occupying the upper part of the hollow in the front of the thigh, and reaching more or less along the lower border

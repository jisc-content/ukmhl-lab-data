THE FOURTH VENTRICLE. 5U In the floor of the ventricle is a median groove, which when traced downward will he found to end in a small hole, the commencement of the central canal of the spinal cord. On each side of this groove is a convex body, the fasciculus teres, which is white at the upper part of the ventricle, hut covered helow hy grey matter, and is the Fig. 263. continuation of the fibres of the lateral tract and restiform body of the medulla. There are four gangliform projections or nuclei on each side of the median groove in the floor of the ventricle. The upper one is for the sixth and facial nerves, and immediately below are some white lines Fig. 263.â€”Vertical longitudinal section of the brain (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

194 THE ABDOMINAL WALL. [Tlie internal oblique is to be divided by a vertical incision from the last rib to the middle of the crest of tlie ilium, and this is to be carried along tlie crest and Poupart’s ligament to near the lower border of the muscle. Tlie muscular fibres must be carefully divided until a cellular interval is reached, in which, near the crista ilii, will be found the branches of an artery (circumflexa ilii). The muscle is then to be turned Fig. 99. backwards and forwards, care being taken not to injure the exposed nerves or the subjacent transversalis muscle.] The Nerves (Fig. 94), five or six in number, are the branches of the lower dorsal nerves, which run horizontally forwards to pierce the rectus muscle and emerge on the front of the abdo- men. At this stage they may be seen giving off their lateral cutaneous branches, which pierce the obliquus interims at once. Close above the crista ilii may be found the branches of the first lumbar nerve (16) (ilio-hypo- gastric and ilio-inguinal) running downwards to the pubes. The Transversalis Muscle (Fig. 99, 6) has its origin—1, from the inner surfaces of the cartilages of the lower six ribs, where it interdigitates with the diaphragm ; 2, by three aponeu- rotic slips attached respectively, to the anterior surfaces of the trans- Fig. 99.—Lateral view of the transversalis abdominis muscle (from Wilson). 1.

THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 311 the trapezius, the anterior border of which it supplies ; the posterior scapular runs under the levator anguli scapula? muscle to the base of the scapula, where it is seen in the dissection of the back. The transverse cervical vein lies above the level of the artery, and usually joins the external jugular. The Suprascapular Artery and Vein (Fig. 164, 31) lie close behind the clavicle. The artery is a branch of the thyroid axis, or sometimes arises from the third part of the subclavian. The vein opens into the external jugular, just before it joins the subclavian vein. The Subclavian Artery (Fig. 164, 30) (3rd portion) extends from the outer border of the anterior scalenus obliquely downwards and outwards be- neath the clavicle to the lower border of the first rib, where it becomes the axillary artery. It has in front the skin, pla- tysma, superficial nerves and deep fascia ; the clavicle, sub- clavius muscle, and supra- scapular vessels; and is crossed by the external jugular vein and the small nerve to the sub- clavius. It lies against the lowest cord of the brachial plexus, the scalenus medius, and the first rib. Above it are the remaining cords of the brachial plexus ; and beloiv (at some distance) the subcla- vian vein.

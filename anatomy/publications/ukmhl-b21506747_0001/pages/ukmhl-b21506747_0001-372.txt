290 THE SYMPHYSIS PUBIS. The posterior pubic ligament can hardly he said to exist, consisting as it does of merely a few scattered fibres. The superior pubic ligament connects the angles of the pubes. The sub-pubic ligament is a strong band passing from one pubic bone to the other, and arching beneath the symphysis. [To see the arrangement of the inter-articular cartilages, a vertical transverse section of the symphysis near its posterior part should be made with the saw.] An inter-articular fibro-cartilage covers the roughly-grooved surface of each pubic bone, the two cartilages being connected in front by strong elastic tissue, but separated posteriorly by a small cavity lined by a synovial membrane. This joint also is an example of amphiarthrosis.

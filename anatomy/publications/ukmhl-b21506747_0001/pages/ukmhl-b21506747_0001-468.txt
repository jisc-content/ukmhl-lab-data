THE PHARYNX. 38(5 The Pneumo-gastric Nerve (Fig. 203, 4) leaves the foramen jugulare in the same sheath as the spinal-accessory nerve, with which it has communicating branches. Two ganglia are found upon the pneumo-gastric nerve, viz., the superior or ganglion of the root, and the inferior or ganglion of the trunk. The ganglion of the root is very small, and is placed in the jugular foramen. It lias minute branches of commu- nication with the glosso- pharyngeal, spinal-accessory, sympathetic, and facial nerves. The communication with the latter is through a minute auricular branch, which enters a hole within the jugular fossa, and passes through the temporal bone to the pinna (Fig. 204, 17). The ganglion of the trunk is nearly an inch long, and of a pink colour, and has branches of communication with the hypoglossal, the sympathetic, and the loop of the first and second cervical nerves. It gives off the following branches :— 1. The pharyngeal branch oj the pneumo-gastric (14), which receives a communicating branch from the spinal-acces- sory nerve, and then passes in front of (or sometimes Fig. 204.—Diagram of the eighth, ninth, and sympathetic nerves (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

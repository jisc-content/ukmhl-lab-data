251 THE LIVER. anterior border of the liver ; the neck is curved upon itself twice and ends in the cystic duct, which is about an inch and a half long and joins the hepatic duct. The mucous membrane presents numerous ridges separating alveoli of irregular shape. The epi- thelium is columnar. The hepatic artery and the portal vein each divide into right and left, and from the right artery the cystic branch should be traced to the gall-bladder. The piece of the vena cava is to be laid open, when the large hepatic veins will be seen opening into it. In order to learn the arrangement of the vessels in the liver, the vena ports; should be carefully laid open for some distance with a pair of scissors. Through the thin wall of the vein a branch of injected hepatic artery will then be seen, and accompanying it is a branch of hepatic duct, the three vessels thus lying side by side in a 'portal canal. One of the hepatic veins being laid open in a similar way, will be seen to be totally unaccompanied. An incision into any part of the liver will show on its cut surfaces a number of openings, some wide open, —the hepatic veins; and others more or less collapsed and having by their sides the sections of a small in- jected artery and duct. These last are the portal veins lying in the portal canals, and they collapse on account of the loose attachment of the fibrous tissue around them. Minute Anatomy (Fig. 136).-—The blood from the chylopoietie viscera is brought to the liver by the vena portae, and from it the bile is secreted. The divisions of the vein have been seen to pass through the portal canals, in which they receive the vaginal and Fig-. 135.—Rabbit’s liver injected, showing a portal vein, with interlobular branches and plexus.

POSTERIOR TRIANGLE OF NECK. 312 portion gives off no branch, but should there be one it will probably be the posterior scapular artery. Surgery.—The position, relations and direction of the third portion of the subclavian should be especially noticed, because it is that on which a ligature is most frequently applied for aneurism lower down. The student should particularly accustom his finger to feel for the scalene tubercle on the first rib and the inner edge of the scalenus anticus muscle, which are taken as the guides to the artery ; and should notice how materially the position of the vessel is altered by raising or depressing the shoulder, the effect of an aneurism in the axilla being to raise the clavicle considerably, and thus complicate the opera- tion. The operation of tying the subclavian in its third part is thus performed. The head being thrown back and the shoulder de- pressed as much as pos- sible, the skin of the lower part of the triangle is to be drawn down upon the clavicle, and a lunated incision carried from the edge of the trapezius to the sterno-mastoid, cutting at once on to the bone. The skin being then allowed to resume its natural position, the incision will be immediately above the clavicle, and may be deep- ened at the anterior part. The external jugular vein is to be care- fully guarded, and held aside if necessary, and a cautious dissection made until the finger can feel the scalenus anticus and the tubercle on the first rib, to which it is attached. Immediately behind this the artery will be found, and even in the uninjected state will be readily recognised by its rolling on the bone beneath the finger. The aneurism needle should be passed from above, so as to avoid the brachial nerves, which are more liable to be included in the ligature than the vein, since this is quite below the artery.

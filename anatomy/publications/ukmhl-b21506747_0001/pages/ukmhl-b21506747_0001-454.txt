372 THE SUBMAXILLARY REGION. tympani, ■which is prolonged on the lingual nerve to the ganglion ; and a sympathetic root from the plexus on the facial artery. The branches of distribution are given to the submaxillary gland. The chorda tympani is afterwards prolonged to the inferior lingualis muscle of the tongue. The Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 198, 15) (9th)* has been seen crossing the upper part of the anterior triangle, after hooking round the occipital artery, to dis- appear beneath the poste- rior border of the mylo- hyoid. It is now seen to lie on the hyo-glossus, which separates it from the lingual artery, and after communi- cating with the lingual nerve, it passes on to the genio- liyo-glossus muscle and the under surface of the tongue. It gives branches in this part of its course to the stylo- glossus, hyo-glossus, genio- hyoid, and genio-hyo-glossus muscles, and also to the in- trinsic muscles of the tongue itself. The Hyo-Glossus (Fig. 199, 6) is a scpuare muscle whicli arises from the body of the hyoid bone close to the median line, from the upper margin of the whole length of its great cornu, and * Lingual nerve of Harrison.

Fig. 28. the radial side of the 5th metacarpal hone, and is inserted into the radial side of the corresponding first phalanx. The Four dorsal interossei (Fig. 28) are penniform muscles arising from the adjacent sides of the metacarpal bones, and therefore showing by the side3 of the palmar muscles to some extent, but are best dissected from behind. They are arranged as adductors from an imaginary line drawn through the middle or long finger, and are therefore inserted as follows :—The 1st (abductor indicis) into the radial side of the base of the first phalanx of the fore-finger ; the 2nd Fig. 27.—The three palmar interosseous muscles of the hand (drawn by J. T. Gray). 1. Tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris. 2. Tendon of flexor carpi radialis. Fig. 28.—The four dorsal interosseous muscles of the hand (drawn by J. T. Gray). 1.

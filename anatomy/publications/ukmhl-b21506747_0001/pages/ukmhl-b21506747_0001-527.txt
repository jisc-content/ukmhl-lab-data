THE ARCH OF THE AORTA. 445 veins are the longer and pass beneath the arch of the aorta, the left veins crossing the descending aorta. The Arch of the Aorta (Fig. 232).—The aorta has been seen to arise from the left ven- tricle, and it at first Fig- 2^'2. takes a course upwards and to the right side, but then backwards and to the left, thus forming an arch. For convenience of descrip- tion the arch is divided into three portions— ascending, horizontal or transverse, and de- scending. 1. The ascending por- tion (i), beginning op- posite the third costal cartilage of the left side, reaches as high as the upper border of the second costal cartilage of the right side close to the sternum. It is almost entirely enclosed within the pericardium, and is crossed at first by the pulmonary artery. In front of the pericardium are the sternum and both pleurae ; behind the ascending aorta is the right .—Diagram of the large vessels of the heart and lungs (from Wilson). Fig. 232 1.

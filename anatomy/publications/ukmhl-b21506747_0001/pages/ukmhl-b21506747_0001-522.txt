440 THE THORAX. The Left Auricle (Fig. 229, i) closely resembles the right auricle, but is altogether on a smaller scale, and its border is thinner and more “ crenate ” than on the opposite side. The openings are those of the four pulmonary veins, two on each side, and the left auriculo- ventricular opening. Fig. 229. The musculi pectinati of the auricular appendix are like those of the right side but smaller, and on the septum of the auricles will be seen the annulus ovalis and fossa ovalis corresponding to those on the right side, but the ring of muscular fibre is not so well developed. [To open the left ventricle, the left forefinger should be intro- duced through the auriculo-ventrieular opening, and the knife thrust through the wall of the ventricle near the apex to meet it.

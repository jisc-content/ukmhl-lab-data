132 SOLE OF THE FOOT. the minute cutaneous branch from the posterior tibial nerve near the heel.] In the description the terms superficial, deep, &c., necessarily refer Fig. 66. and has nothing to do 'with the to the position of the parts as seen in the dissection, and not to that they would hold if the body were in the upright position. The Plantar Fascia (Fig. 66, 2) closely resembles the fascia of the palm, and is divisible into three portions. The central, which is the strongest, is attached to the under surface of the great tuber- osity of the os calcis, but expands as it passes forwards to nearly the entire width of the foot. It splits into five portions opposite the heads of the metatarsal bones, and at this point distinct trans- verse fibres will be seen passing across the foot. The five processes are attached to the sheaths of the flexor tendons of each toe, and between them the several digital vessels and nerves pass. A transverse ligament has been described in the skin of the web of the toes, passing over the digi- tal vessels and nerves. This is hardly worthy of a special de- scription, as it is merely a slight extra development of the cutis, e plantar fascia.

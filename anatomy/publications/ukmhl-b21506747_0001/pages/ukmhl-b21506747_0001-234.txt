LIGAMENTS OF THE LEG. 152 into two portions, the long and short, the long being the anterior one of the two. The divisions of the tendon of the biceps embrace the long ligament, and must be divided to expose it thoroughly. It is a round cord attached to the side of the external condyle immediately Fig. 79. Fig. 80. above the depression for the popliteus, and to the outer side of the head of the fibula. The tendon of the popliteus and the external inferior articular artery have been traced beneath it. The short ligament, which is derived from the tendon of the gastrocnemius, is placed behind the long, and reaches from the condyle to the head of the fibula, but it is often very indistinct. The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 79, 5) is a broad band closely connected with the capsular ligament. It is attached to the Fig. 79.—Anterior view of the ligaments of the knee-joint (from Wilson). 1. Tendon of rectus. 2. Patella. 3. Ligamentum patellae. 4. 4.

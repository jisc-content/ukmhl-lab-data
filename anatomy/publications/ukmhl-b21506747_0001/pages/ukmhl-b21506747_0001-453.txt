Upon the hyo-glossus it crosses the duct and lies below it, but if followed to the side of the tongue will be found to pass again beneath the duct, and to be distributed to the side and Fig. 198. tip of the tongue, supplying the fungiform and filiform papilla). Branches of communication pass across the hyo-glossus to the 9th nerve, and a little below the level of the trunk, opposite the deep portion of the submaxillary gland, may be found the following ganglion. The submaxillary ganglion (2) is of small size and lies below the lingual nerve. It has three roots, the sensory derived from the lingual; the motor from the facial (7th) by means of the chorda Fig. 198.— Nerves of the tongue (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

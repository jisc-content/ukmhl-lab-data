514 THE CEREBELLUM. {lineal transversal), which, run transversely from the median fissure, and are connected witli the auditory nerve. The lower nuclei are for the auditory, the eighth, and the ninth nerves. The lower extremity of the ventricle, which is hounded on each side by the enlarged extremities (processus clavati) of the Posterior Pyrajrnids of the spinal cord, has been called the calamus scriptorius, from its fancied resemblance to a pen, of which the lineae transversse form the feathers. By slicing vertically either hemisphere of the cerebellum, the appear- ing. 264. ance known as the arbor vitce (Fig. 263, 19) will be brought into view. This is due to the pecu- liar arrangement of white cerebral matter within the grey matter of the external laminae ; and by careful slicing, an irre- gular grey body (corpus dentatum) will be seen in the centre of the white matter of each hemi- sphere. By making a transverse section of the medulla oblongata a small corpus dentatum will also be seen in the olivary body of each side (Fig. 264, c). When possible, the student as soon as he has finished the above dissection, should procure another brain in order that he may make various sections of it, and so more thoroughly understand the rela- tions of the several parts. The most useful section is one made in the median plane (Fig. 263), or a little to one side of it (Fig. 257), by which most of the important parts will be exposed. .â€”Transverse section of Medulla oblongata magnified (after Stilling) Eig. 264 a.

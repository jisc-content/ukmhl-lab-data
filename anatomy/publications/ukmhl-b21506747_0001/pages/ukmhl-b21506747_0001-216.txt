SOLE OF THE FOOT. 134 annular ligament, from the greater tuberosity of the os calcis (internal to the origin of the flexor brevis digitorum), and slightly from the plantar fascia. The muscle ends in a broad tendon, which is joined by the inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis, and is inserted into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe. The Abductor Minimi Digiti (Fig. 67, 4) arises from the lesser tuberosity of the os calcis ; from the greater tuberosity in front of Fig. 67. Fig. 68. Fig. 67.—First layer of muscles 1. Os calcis. 2.

On the second and third toes the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum are seen passing through the bifur- cation of the tendons of the flexor brevis digitorum.

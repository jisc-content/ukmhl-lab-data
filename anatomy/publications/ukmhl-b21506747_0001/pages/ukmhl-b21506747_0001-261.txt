THE PUDIC NERVE. 179 then pierces the suspensory ligament to reach the upper surface of the organ, where it will he subsequently traced. When the pudic artery is small, the dorsal arteries are derived from the trunks of the internal iliacs, and reach the penis by piercing the triangular ligament on each side of the dorsal vein. Fig. 91. The Dorsal Vein of the penis will afterwards be seen piercing the pelvic fascia to join the prostatic plexus of veins. The Veins corresponding to the other branches of the pudic artery take the same course as their arteries, and open into the pudic vein. The Pudic Nerve (Fig. 89, 3) lies externally to the pudic artery, Fig. 91.â€”Arteries of the perinaeum (from Wilson). On the right side the superficial arteries are seen, on the left the deep. 1.

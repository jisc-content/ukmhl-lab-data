THE THORAX. 4 64 are from the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses, and are principally derived from the pneumo-gastrics. They can he traced upon the bronchial tubes for some distance, and are said to have minute ganglia developed upon them. The lymphatics of the lung are connected with the bronchial glands found about the bifurcation of the trachea. Articulation of the Ribs with the Vertebrae. The ligaments of the ribs may be divided into two sets, (1) those connecting the ribs with the bodies of the vertebrae (costo-vertebral), and (2) those connecting the ribs with the transverse processes (costo- transverse). 1. The costo-vertebral ligaments are Anterior, Capsular, and Inter- articular. The Anterior Cbsto-vertebral or Stellate Ligament (Fig. 242, 2) consists of three short fasciculi which radiate from the ante- rior surface of the head of the rib. The superior fasciculus passes to Fig. 242.-—Anterior ligament of the vertebrae, and ligaments of the ribs (from Wilson). 1. Anterior common ligament. 4. Interarticular ligament connect- 2.

3G8 THE PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGION. The Lingual or Gustatory Nerve* (Fig. 197, 16) lies at first between the two pterygoid muscles, and then passes forward between the internal surface of the ramus of the jaw and the internal ptery- goid muscle ; it will be afterwards traced to the side and tip of the Fig. 197. * Since the glosso-pharyngeal nerve has been conclusively shown to be the special nerve of taste, it is desirable that the term “gustatory” as applied to the lingual branch of the fifth should be abandoned.

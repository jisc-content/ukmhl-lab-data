INTRODUCTION. 4 more time and labour for their dissection than a student can afford to bestow upon them. The student should bear in mind that his manual labour is only a part of his duty, and will be thrown away, unless he at the same time study the description of the part upon which he is engaged ; he therefore should not carry the dissection further than he can learn the description on the same day, and at the subject; and should if possible re-peruse the description in the evening, and always on the next morning, before carrying the dissection any further. In order to preserve a part, it is essential that the dissector should himself secure the skin around it with a few stitches, and wrap it with damp cloths. These may be dipped in some preservative solu- tion, or common salt may be grated finely over the part. This latter, however, destroys the colour of the part and its smooth appearance. A dissected part should be sponged over daily, when it is uncovered for fresh dissection.

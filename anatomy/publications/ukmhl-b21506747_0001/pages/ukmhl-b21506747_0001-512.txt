THE THORAX. 430 the pleurae at the sides, and is placed a little to the left of the median line. It contains (1) the triangularis stemi muscle ; (2) the origins of the sterno-hvoid and sternothyroid muscles; (3) the remains of the thymus gland (a ductless gland largely developed in the foetus); (4) Fig. 225. the left internal mammary vessels ; some cellular tissue and a few lymphatics. The Middle Mediastinum is the space between the two lungs, and contains therefore (1) the heart and large vessels, (2) the pericardium, (3) the roots of the lungs, and (4) the phrenic nerves. The Posterior Mediastinum is behind the pericardium, and will he afterwards dissected. It contains (1) the thoracic aorta, (2) the trachea, (3) the oesophagus with the two pneumogastric nerves, (4) Fig. 225.â€”Diagram of a transverse section of the thorax (altered from Wilson and Carter, by J.

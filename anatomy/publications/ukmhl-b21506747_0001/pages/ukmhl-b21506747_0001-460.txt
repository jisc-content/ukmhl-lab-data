378 DEEP DISSECTION OF NECK. The Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve (Fig. 201, 2) leaves the jugular foramen in front of the pneumo-gastric, and arches forward over the internal carotid artery to the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, against which it lies. Opposite the base of the tongue it turns forward across the stylo-pharyngeus beneath the stylo-glossus, and has been traced to Fig. 201. the base of the tongue of which it is the special nerve (p. 376). The connections and branches of the nerve will be subsequently dissected. The Stylo-pharyngeus Muscle (Fig. 201, 3) is now fully ex- posed in its upper part. It arises from the inner surface of the root of the styloid process of the temporal bone, and passing obliquely forwards and downwards with the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, between Fig. 201.â€”The deep vessels and nerves of the base of the skull (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

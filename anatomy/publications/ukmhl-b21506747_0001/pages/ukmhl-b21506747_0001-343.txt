2G1 THE PELVIC FASCIA. the upper part of the arch and, joining with a like process from the fascia of the opposite side, forms the so-called deep layer of the triangular ligament (Carrington). In addition, it gives a thin layer to the under surface of the levator ani, called the anal fascia (Fig. 146), which is lost on the rectum and external sphincter, and was seen in the dissection of the perinaeum. The redo-vesical layer is seen within the pelvis, and is continued over the internal surface of the levator ani to the bladder, forming the lateral true ligaments, and from the back of the pubes, forming the Fig. 146.

Anal fascia. anterior true (puboprostatic) ligaments of the bladder ; whilst between them it is seen to dip down to the prostate, of which it forms the capsule, and is thus continued from one side to the other of the pelvis, of which it closes the outlet. The recto-vesical fascia is continuous behind with the fascia covering the pyriformis, coccygeus, and sacral plexus, and on each side with the obturator fascia already described. The line along which the recto-vesical is continuous with the obturator fascia extends from the back of the pubes to the spine of the ischium, and corresponds to the origin of the levator ani muscle. This is com- monly known as the “white line ” (Fig. 144, 18), but is often wanting, the fibres of the levator ani passing upwards beyond the position of the white line, and thus separating the obturator from the pelvic fascia (Quain). A very distinct white line is always seen more Fig. 146.—Section of pelvis to show the pelvic fascia from the front (drawn by J. T. Gray).

136 SOLE OF THE FOOT. branches of the posterior tibia! nerve ; their relation to the arteries has been mentioned. The Internal plantar nerve (5) supplying the abductor pollicis Fig. 69. is the larger of the two, and after and flexor brevis digitorum, gives off a digital branch to the inner side of the great toe, and breaks up into three other digital branches ; each of these bifur- cates at the roots of the toes, and they thus supply the outer side of the great toe, both sides of the second and third toes, and half the fourth toe. The nerve also gives muscular branches to the flexor brevis pollicis and the two inner lumbricales muscles, and cutaneous branches to the sole. The External plantar nerve (3) crosses the foot with and in front of the external plantar artery, giving branches to the abductor minimi digiti and ac- cessorius in its course. At the outer border of the accessorius i divides into superficial and deep portions, the deep accompanying the artery. The superficial por- tion supplies the flexor brevis minimi digiti and the interosseous muscles in the fourth or oute- most space, and gives cutaneous branches to the sole.

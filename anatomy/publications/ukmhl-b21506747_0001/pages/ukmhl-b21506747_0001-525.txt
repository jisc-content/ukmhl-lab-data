443 THE FCETAL CIRCULATION. offer an obstruction to the flow of blood during contrac- tion of the ventricle, a “ sys- tolic aortic bruit ” will be heard. A horizontal section above the valves (Fig. 231) shows their relation to one another. The left ventricle occupies the posterior aspect of the heart, and the mitral orifice and valve are therefore behind. In front of this is the aortic orifice, separated only by a fibrous septum. To the left of the aorta, and a little in front, is the pulmonary artery, with its valves, and to the right is the tricuspid or right auriculo-ventricular valve. The Foetal Circulation (Fig. 231).—This will be the best opportunity for contrast- ing the adult circulation with that of the foetus. In the foetus the blood is brought from the placenta by the um- bilical vein, which enters the body at the umbilicus. It then passes along the longitudinal fissure of the liver, and at the transverse fissure divides into Fig. 231. Fig. 231.—Diagram of the Foetal circulation (from 'Wilson). 1. Umbilical vein proceeding from the placenta. (2). 3. Umbilical vein, dividing into branches; two (4, 4), to be distributed to the liver; and one (5), the ductus venosus, which enters the inferior vena cava (6). 7.

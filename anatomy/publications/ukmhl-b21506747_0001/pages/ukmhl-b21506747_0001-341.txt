259 THE PELVIC FASCIA. of the obturator foramen, tlie extremities of the two cuts being about an inch apart in the bottom of the cavity. These are to be joined b}r a vertical cut with the chisel, and the piece of bone having been loosened with that instrument can be removed with the bone-forceps. With the chisel and bone-forceps the margins of the obturator fora- men may then be cut away so as to leave only a ring of bone. Tlie obturator interims being now fully exposed, should be carefully detached from the adjacent structures, and may then be readily removed by grasping the tendon with the bone-forceps and drawing the whole muscle out through the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. The outer surface of the pelvic fascia will then be exposed.] The Pelvic Fascia (Fig. 144) consists of several more or less distinct structures, which are however in many places continuous with one another. It is a single layer down to the level of a white Fig. 144.—Pelvic fascia seen from the outside (drawn by J. T. Gray). I. External cutaneous nerve. II. Poupart’s ligament. 3. Sartorius. 4.

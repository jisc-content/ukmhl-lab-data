FOURTH LAYER OF MUSCLES. 473 processes of the upper six dorsal vertebrae. It is inserted into the posterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the lower six cervical vertebra;. The Trachelo-mastoideus (Fig. 246, 7) is to the inner side of the transversalis, and between it and the complexus. It arises, with the transversalis, from the transverse processes of the upper four dorsal vertebrae and from the articular processes of the lower four cervical vertebrae ; and is inserted into the posterior part of the apex of the mastoid process beneath the splenius capitis. The Complexus (Fig. 246, 8) is a large muscle placed close to the vertebrae and reaching to the oc- ciput, and is remarkable for a tendinous intersection about its middle, and for being pierced by the great occipital and third nerves. It arises from the transverse pro- cesses of the upper six dorsal and last cervical vertebrae, and from the articular processes of the 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical vertebrae. Its fibres ascend nearly vertically to be in- serted into the occipital bone be- tween the curved lines. The most internal and superficial part of the complexus has been Fig. 246.â€”Fourth and fifth, and part of the sixth layer of the muscles of the back (from Wilson). 1.

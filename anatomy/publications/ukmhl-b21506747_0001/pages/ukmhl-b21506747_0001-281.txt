199 VARIETIES OF INGUINAL HERNIA. occurring during tlie later months of foetal life, an obliteration of the portion of tube within the canal takes place, and thus a small sac is formed around the testis which is called the tunica vaginalis, while a mere dimple is left in the peritoneum at the internal ring. Tlius, when in the ordinary condition of the parts a hernia descends, its sac is above and quite distinct from the tunica vaginalis (Fig. 102). Occasionally, however, this obliteration does not take place, and the tunica vaginalis remains continuous with the peritoneum. In that case the hernia descends at once into the tunica vaginalis and lies over the testis, and being the consequence of a congenital defect it is termed congenital hernia (Fig. 103). In what is termed congenital hydrocele the anatomical arrange- ment is the same, and the fluid runs from the peritoneal cavity into the scrotum and back again, according to the position of the patient. Infantile or encysted hernia exists when only a partial obliteration of the peritoneal tube has taken place, and the tunica vaginalis is left larger than usual and prolonged into the inguinal canal to a slight extent. Thus, when a hernia descends, it pushes down behind this portion of the tunica vaginalis, and there are therefore three layers of serous membrane in front of that covering the intestine, two Fig. 102.—Diagram of a common scrotal hernia, showing the relation of the sac to the tunica vaginalis testis (J.

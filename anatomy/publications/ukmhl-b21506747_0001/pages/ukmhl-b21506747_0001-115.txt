The Infra-spinatus Muscle (Fig. 10, 5) arises from the whole of the infraspinal fossa except the part near the neck of the scapula ; Fig. 10. from the fascia covering the muscle, and from the intermuscular septa between it and the teres muscles. It is inserted into the middle facet on the great tuberosity of the humerus and into the capsule of the shoulder-joint, being blended there with the supra-spinatus and teres minor. The supra- and infra-spinatus muscles are supplied by the suprascapular nerve. The Teres Minor Muscle (Fig. 10, 9) arises from the dorsal aspect of the inferior costa or border of the scapula in nearly its Fig. 10.â€”Scapular muscles, vessels, and nerves (from University College Museum). 1.

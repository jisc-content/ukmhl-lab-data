THE CEREBELLUM. 510 border of the testes. The two divisible into two lateral halves united by a commissure, and the horizontal fissure divides the organ into an upper and a lower part. The upper surface is flat except in Fig. 261. the median line, where there is a slight ridge forming the commissure, and called the superior vermiform process. The upper part of each hemisphere is divided into an ante- rior and a posterior lobe by an indis- tinct fissure. The anterior lobe is the larger, and of a square shape, reaching as far back as the posterior extremity of the vermiform process. The posterior lobe is the small por- tion behind the level of the vermi- form process, and reaches to the hori- zontal fissure. The cerebellum is connected to the cerebrum and spinal cord by three peduncles or crura, of which the superior one can now be seen. The Superior Peduncle (Fig. 261, 3) (processus a cerebello ad testes) is a broad, flattened white band, which is connected below with the inferior vermiform process, and passes forwards to the corpora quadrige- mina, the two peduncles of opposite sides converging at the posterior processes are prolonged beneath the Fig. 261.â€”Fourth ventricle and upper part of spinal cord and membranes.

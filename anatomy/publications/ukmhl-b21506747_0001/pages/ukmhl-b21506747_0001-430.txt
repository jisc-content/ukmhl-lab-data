THE FACE. 348 beneath running in parallel rows to the free margin, will be seen. Close to the inner canthus is a reddish body, the caruncula lachry- malis (8), composed of mucous follicles, and external to it is a minute semilunar fold of conjunctiva, called the jplica semilunaris (7), the representative of the membrana nictitans of birds, crocodiles, and batra- cliia. The conjunctiva is the mucous lining of the lids, and is continued on to the eyeball, where it is loosely attached to the sclerotic but inseparably to the cornea. If the conjunctiva be carefully divided over the sclerotic, the attachments of the muscles of the eyeball may be seen. Fig. 184. The student should recognise with his finger the prominences of the nasal, malar, and jaw bones, and also the margin of the orbit ; and it will be well also to examine the state of tension of the eye-ball by pressing upon it gently with the fore- fingers, since this varies very much according to the freshness of the subject. Opportunity should be taken also to examine the external ear, and, if possible, to see the membrana tym- pani with a speculum. The Pinna (Fig. 183) is composed of cartilage covered with skin, and is divided into the following parts :—The outer rim is the helix (1), and that next to Fig. 184.—The pinna and its muscles, as seen from behind (from Wilson, after Arnold). 1, 1. Border of the helix. 2. Spine of the helix. 3. Convexity corresponding with the fossa scaphoidea. 4, 4. Convexity of the concha; the fissure between the numbers corresponds with the crus helicis. 5. Ponticulus conchae. 6. 6. Cartilage of the meatus. 7. Aperture of the meatus. 8. Attrahens aurem. 9. Attollens aurem. 10. Retrahens aurem. 11. Transversus auriculae. 12. Obliquus auricula'.

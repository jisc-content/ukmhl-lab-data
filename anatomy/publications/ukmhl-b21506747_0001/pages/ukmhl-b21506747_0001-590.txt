INTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. 508 of which the outer one is the larger. By turning the brain on its side the optic tract may he readily traced to the under surface of the optic thalamus, to which it is attached; and will be found to divide into two parts, which are connected with the corpora geniculata, and pass on to the corpora quadrigemina. Fig. 260. The Pineal Body or Gland (Fig. 260, io) (conarium) is a pink body of a conical shape, lying between the anterior pair of the corpora quadrigemina and above the posterior commissure of the third ventricle. Its anterior part or base is connected with the margins â€”Third ventricle of brain (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). Fig. 260. 1. Corpus sti'iatum dissected. 2. Fifth ventricle. 3.

Fig. 128. forms two folds which project into the caecum and form the valve. The upper fold, which is horizontal in direction, is sometimes known as the ileo-colic, ancl the lower or more vertical one as the ileo-ccecal Fig. 127.—Section of the lower part of ileum of the calf, through a Peyer’s gland (from Wilson, after Kblliker). 1.

VISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. 246 fold.* The ridges on each side, formed by the prolongation of the. two folds, are called the frcena or retinacula. It is obvious that these folds permit the ready passage of fluid from the small into the large intestine, but would prevent regurgitation unless the parts were very much over-distended. The mucous membrane of the large intestine has no villi, for they cease abruptly at the free margin of the ileo-ccecal valve, but resembles that of the small intestine in having columnar epithelium and a muscular layer. Tubular glands resembling the follicles of Lieberkiihn, and solitary glands or closed follicles, embedded in the submucous tissue and having over them small depressions on the mucous surface, are found throughout the large intestine (Figs. 129 and 130). The Pancreas (Fig. 113) should be cleaned but left attached to the duodenum. It is about seven inches long, and the larger end, where it touches the bowel, is called the head, the central portion the body, and the small extremity the tail. Its average weight is three ounces. The pancreas is a compound racemose gland, and consists of lobules of a yellowish colour held together by loose fibrous tissue, a small duct passing from each lobule into the main *' Artificial memory, SHI P—Superior Horizontal, Inferior Perpendicular.

THE SMALL INTESTINES. 241 where the vessels enter, the second part only in front, and the third part not at all ; the jejunum and ileum are completely covered by peritoneum. The longitudinal muscular fibres are external, and the circular internal,* and they are both complete and continuous layers, the internal being considerably the thicker of the two. There is also a fine muscular layer (muscularis mucosa) between the areolar and mucous layers, as in the stomach. The mucous membrane has the following characteristics throughout—valvulce conniventes, villi, Lie- berkiihn’s follicles, solitary glands, and a columnar epithelium ; but the duodenum and ileum have certain special structures in addition. * An artificial aid to the remembrance of this fact is afforded by noting that lOngitudinal = Outer, and circular = Inner layer.

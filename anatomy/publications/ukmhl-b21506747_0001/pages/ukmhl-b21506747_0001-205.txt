123 THE PLANTAEIS. Fig. 59. The Gastrocnemius (Fig. 60, 4), the superficial muscle of the calf, has a double-headed origin from the back of the femur imme- diately above the condyles, both heads being firmly attached to the capsule of the knee-joint. A bursa, sometimes communicating -with the knee-joint, lies between the inner head and the tendon of the semi-membranosus. The two heads are the lower boundaries of the popliteal space, and unite to form one large muscle, the fibres of which end about the middle of the leg in a broad tendon, which contracts near the heel into the thick rounded tendo Acliillis (6). This, which is the common insertion of the gastrocnemius and the subjacent soleus, expands again slightly, to be inserted into the lower part of the posterior surface of the calcaneum, a bursa intervening between it and the upper part of the same bone. [The remaining head of the gastro- cnemius being carefully divided near its origin, and the muscle turned down as far as possible, the plantaris and soleus, vdth the popliteus covered by its fascia, will be brought into mew.] The Plantaris (Fig. 54, 12) arises from above the external condyle of the femur and from the line leading to it from the linea aspera, the muscle lying internal to the outer head of the gas- trocnemius. Its fleshy fibres are about Fig. 59.â€”Superficial nerves of the back of the leg (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Internal popliteal nerve. 2. External popliteal nerve. 3.

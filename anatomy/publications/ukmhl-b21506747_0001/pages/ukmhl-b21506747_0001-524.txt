442 THE THORAX. A fibrous ring intervenes between the muscular tissue of the heart and the aorta, the lining membrane of which is continuous with the endocardium. The Aortic semilunar valves resemble those of the pulmonary artery but are more fully developed, and the corpora Arantii are better seen than on the right side. The aortic valves occupy a position the converse of those of the pulmonary artery, viz. one in Fig. 230. front and two behind ; and above each of the three valves there is a dilatation of the aorta, called the aortic sinus, or sinus of Valsalva. At the bottom of the anterior and left posterior sinuses will be seen the orifices of the coronary arteries, the first branches of the aorta. The aortic valves act during dilatation of the ventricle (diastole), and prevent regurgitation into the ventricle, their closure accom- panying the “ second sound ” of the heart, which is best heard over the base of the heart and on the sternum opposite the second inter- costal space (Fig. 227, ao.). If from disease of the valves their closure is not perfect and regurgitation occurs, a “ diastolic aortic bruit ” is produced : if the surfaces of the valves should be so roughened as to Fig. 230.—A section of the heart at the level of the valves, seen from above (from Sibson’s Medical Anatomy).

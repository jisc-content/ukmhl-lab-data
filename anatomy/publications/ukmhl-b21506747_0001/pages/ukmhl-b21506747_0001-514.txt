432 THE THORAX. [The pericardium is to be dissected from the roots of the lungs, and entirely removed from the great vessels, except a small piece, which should he left to mark the point at which it was attached to the aorta.] The Hoots of the Lungs (Figs. 225 and 226) are each formed by a pulmonary artery, two pulmonary veins, and a bronchus, bound Fig. 226. together by cellular tissue; together with the small bronchial vessels, the pulmonary plexus of the pneumogastric nerve, and some lym- phatics. The order of the vessels from before backwards on both sides of the body is the same, viz. veins, artery, and bronchus; from Fig. 226.â€”The heart and lungs (from Wilson). 1. Right ventricle. 2.

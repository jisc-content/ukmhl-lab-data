239 THE STOMACH. with those of the oesophagus, and, running principally along the lesser curvature, are continued into the duodenum. The circular fibres, which are next in order, enclose the entire viscus, and are collected together at the small end to form the pylorus. The oblique fibres are most internal, and are continuous with the circular fibres of the Fig. 119. oesophagus; they are distributed principally over the great end of the stomach. The areolar or sub-mucous coat consists of areolar tissue in which the blood-vessels ramify, and between this and the mucous coat is a fine layer of involuntary muscle the muscularis mucosce. Oft laying open the stomach along its lesser curvature, the mucous membrane will be seen to be arranged in longitudinal folds or ridges called rugce, which disappear when the viscus is distended and are Fig. 119.—Vertical and longitudinal section of the stomach and duodenum (from Wilson). 1.

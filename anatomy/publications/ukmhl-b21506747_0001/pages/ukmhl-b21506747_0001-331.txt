249 THE LIVER. or suspensory ligament; and on tracing this hack, its two layers will he found to diverge, forming the upper layer of the coronary and also the two lateral ligaments. If the left lateral ligament he traced, it will he found to consist of a double fold of the peritoneum, which may he followed to the under surface of the left lobe. The upper layer of the coronary ligament, if traced outwards in the same way, will he found to be reflected upon itself to form the right lateral ligament, and then will he followed to the under surface of the right lobe of the liver behind the transverse fissure, to form the under layer of the coronary ligament. A more or less triangular Fig. 134. interval is thus left between the two, in which the liver is attached to the diaphragm by cellular tissue, and has the right supra-renal capsule and top of the right kidney in close relation with it, and through which the vena cava passes to the diaphragm. In this manner four ligaments of the liver are formed by peritoneum, the fifth or round ligament being the obliterated umbilical vein. The under surface of the liver (Fig. 134) presents five fissures and five lobes for examination. Fig. 134.â€”Undersurface of R. Right lobe. L. Left lobe. Q. Lobus quadratus. S. Lobus Spigelii. C.

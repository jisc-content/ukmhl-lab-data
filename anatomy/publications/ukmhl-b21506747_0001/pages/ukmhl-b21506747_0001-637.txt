London : J. & A. CHURCHILL. DR. GEORGE HENRY FOX’S PHOTOGRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS OP SKIN DISEASES, (60 Cases from Life,) AND THE SAME AUTHOR'S PHOTOGRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS OF CUTANEOUS SYPHILIS (70 Cases from Life). As one of the Suvgeons to the New York Dispensary, in charge of the Skin and Venereal Department, where upwards of five thousand cases are treated annually, the Author has had an ample amount of clinical mate- rial from which to select cases. Through the kindness of physicians in charge of the Skin Clinics he has had the advantage of drawing largely from other Dispensaries and Hospitals in New York and Brooklyn. The Colouring is a special feature, and has been entrusted to a skil- ful anatomical artist, J. GAERTNER, M.D., formerly a physician and student under Hebra, in the General Hospital of Vienna. These plates are carefully coloured by hand, and more accurately represent disease than any lithographs or coloured photographs which have ever been offered to the profession. Each work contains 18 Quarto Plates, with Descriptive Text, half- bound. The price of each work is Five Guineas. The Medical Times and Gazette says of the Flates :—“ All are good, and some are most admirable and excellent life-like representations of disease.” The Edinburgh Medical Journal says:—“On the whole, this collection of photographs is of great excellence, and the work will be of the utmost value to all practitioners of medicine. The British Medical Journal says:—“ These very excellent photographs carry the art of photographic representation of pathological appearances further and higher than any which we have yet seen. The subjects are well-selected ; the photographs are excellent; and the colouring life-like and restrained from excess of violence in tone. They are very successful, and will undoubtedly be popular. Dr. Fox is a highly-educated dermatologist, and his text is excellent.”

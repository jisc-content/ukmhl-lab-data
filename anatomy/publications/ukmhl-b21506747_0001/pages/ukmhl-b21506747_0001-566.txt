THE SPINAL CORD AND MEMBRANES. 484 The anterior cornua of the grey crescents are larger than the posterior cornua, but do not reach to the periphery of the cord ; the slender posterior cornua are closely connected with the posterior roots of the spinal nerves in the lateral fissure. A small central canal (canal of Stilling) exists throughout the cord. It is impossible for the student in his ordinary dissection to inves- tigate the minute anatomy of the spinal cord, and he is therefore referred to works on minute anatomy for fuller details.

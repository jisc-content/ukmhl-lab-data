49 BACK OF THE FORE-ARM. The Dorsal branch of the Ulnar Nerve (Fig. 18, 7) appears on the inner side of the wrist, at a point corresponding to the lower end of the ulna, and gives digital branches to both sides of the little finger and the ulnar side of the ring finger, joining the radial nerve across the hack of the hand. The Superficial Veins (Fig. 18) of the hand form an arch across the back of the metacarpus, which joins the radial and posterior ulnar veins at its extremities; the veins of the fore-arm wind round the limb to join the radial and ulnar veins respectively, and one or two branches form communications be- tween them and across the back of the fore-arm. [The deep fascia is to be removed from the back of the fore-arm and hand, with the exception of a band about an inch wide, which is to be left opposite the lower end of the radius, to form the 'posterior annular ligament. The slender posterior in- terosseous artery to the outer side of the extensor carpi ulnaris is to be preserved. It will be found to be impossible to remove the fascia en- tirely near the elbow, where it is incorporated with the muscles.] Muscles of the Back of the Fore-arm (Fig. 19).—The muscles arising from the external condyle of the humerus are either extensors* * Artificial memory, Air-tensors from Ar-temal condyle. lig. 18.

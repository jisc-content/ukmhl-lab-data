119 THE HIP-JOINT. trinity should now be taken to trace the reflected tendon of the rectus fenioris, arising from a depression above the acetabulum. When the subject is replaced on its back, the front of the joint is also to be dissected by removing the psoas and iliacus and the remains of the pectineus, after which it may be opened and the limb removed.] Fig. 56. The Hip-Joint is the best example in the body of enarthrosis or ball-and-socket joint, and of necessity has a capsular ligament besides other internal ligaments. The hip-joint has in front the united psoas and iliacus muscles, and Fig. 56.â€”Section through the hip and gluteal region (altered from Beraud) 1. Gluteus maximus. 2. Gluteus medius. 3.

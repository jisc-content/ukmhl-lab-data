128 BACK OF THE LEG. inner side and then crossing to its outer side, in which relation it con- tinues to the foot. The posterior tibial artery has two vence comites, which join those of the anterior tibial artery to form the popliteal vein. Surgery (Fig. 62).—The operation of tying the posterior tibial artery is seldom performed except on the dead body, but the vessel may be reached in three parts of its course. Behind the malleolus Fig. 62. the artery is readily exposed by a semi-lunar incision two inches long, made three-quarters of an inch behind the margin of the bone, the edge of the knife being directed towards the tibia so as to divide the internal annular ligament. At the lower part of the leg the vessel may be reached by a vertical incision a little to the inner side of the tendo Achillis, and will be found lying upon the flexor digitorum. In the middle of the leg the operation is one of some difficulty and somewhat damages the dissection if performed. The best mode of proceeding is to make a vertical incision four inches long, parallel to, and half an inch behind, the edge of the tibia; the gastrocnemius slips aside and the soleus is then to be divided, especial care being taken to cut through the tendon on its under surface, but to go no deeper. A little dissection, close beneath this tibial attachment and towards the fibula, will expose the posterior tibial artery lying upon the tibialis posticus, with the posterior tibial nerve to its outer side. The Branches (Fig. 63) of the posterior tibial artery are (1) peroneal; (2) muscular branches ; (3) nutritious to the tibia; (4) a communicating branch ; and (5) internal calcanean.

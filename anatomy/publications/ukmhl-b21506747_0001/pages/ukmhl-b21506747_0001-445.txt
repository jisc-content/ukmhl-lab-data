363 MUSCLES OF MASTICATION. the lower part, and pierced by the mylo-hyoid branches of artery and nerve near the bone.' The Internal Pterygoid Muscle (Fig. 191, 3) is placed beneath the internal lateral ligament. It arises from the internal surface of the external pterygoid plate, and from the tuberosity of the palate Fig. 193. Fig. 194. bone and superior maxilla, and is inserted into the inner surface of the angle of the lower jaw, its fibres running parallel to the superficial portion of the masseter. In many subjects a portion of the internal pterygoid arises from the outer surface of the tuberosity of the superior maxilla, anterior to the fibres of the pterygoideus extemus (Fig. 196). The Buccinator (Fig. 196, 14) forms the greater part of the cheek, and has been partly seen in the dissection of the face. It arises from the alveolar border of the superior maxilla opposite the molar teeth ; from a corresponding portion of the inferior maxilla ; and between the jaws from the anterior border of the pterygo-maxillary ligament.

THE OVARY. in grasping the ovule as it emerges from that organ. The tube is muscular in structure, and is lined by a mucous membrane with ciliated epithelium. The Round Ligament (Fig. 157, 8) placed in the anterior part of the broad ligament has been already traced (p. 268). It is com- Fig. 157. posed of unstriped muscular and areolar tissue, and is covered by peritoneum, which in the child can be traced for a short distance into the inguinal canal, forming the canal of Nuck. The Ovary (Fig. 157, ii) is an oval body situated in the posterior part of the broad ligament on each side of the uterus. In the young sirbject it is smooth and plump, but in the old subject it is shrivelled and scarred. It is attached to the fundus of the uterus by a slender cord, the ligament of the ovary (12), and has one of the fimbriae of the Fallopian tube attached to its surface (13). It is composed of a fibrous capsule (tunica albuginea) containing the Graafian vesicles, from which the ovules are discharged by a process of dehiscence or bursting, producing a cicatrix on the surface of the ovary, and within it a shrivelled clot called the corpus luteum. Between the Fallopian tube and the ovary, and contained in the broad ligament, are the remains of the Wolffian body, a fetal struc- Fig. 157.â€”Uterus with its appendages Wilson). 1.

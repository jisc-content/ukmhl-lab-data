SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. 300 The Falx Major (Fig. 160, 2) or falx cerebri is a vertical sickle- shaped process of dura mater placed between the two hemispheres of the cerebrum. Above it is convex and attached to the skull in the middle line, below it is free and concave and reaches towards the Fig. 160. corpus callosum. The superior and inferior longitudinal sinuses run along its upper and lower borders. It is attached in front to the crista galli of the ethmoid hone, and behind, where it is much deeper, it is attached to the internal occipital protuberance, and to Fig. 160.â€”Sinuses of the skull (side view) (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

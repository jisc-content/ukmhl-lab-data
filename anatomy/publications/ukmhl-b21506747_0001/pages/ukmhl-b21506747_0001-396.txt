The 5th and 6th next unite, and are joined by the 7th at the outer border of the scalenus posticus, and thus two cords are formed. At the level of the clavicle each of these cords gives olf a large branch, and they unite to form a third cord ; the three nerves then come into relation with the axillary artery, being at first external, but afterwards internal, external, and posterior to that vessel. More frequently the three trunks formed by the junction of the five nerves subdivide and reunite to form three cords, as follows, without the production of two cords only at any one point : —

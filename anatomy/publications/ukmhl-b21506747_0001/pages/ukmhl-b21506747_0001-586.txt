504 INTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. through the septum lucidum with a pair of scissors close to the remains of the corpus callosum, which must he turned forward. It lies between the two layers of the septum lucidum, and is deepest in front. It is lined by a delicate membrane, which in the adult forms a shut sac, but in the foetus communicates with the subjacent third ventricle. The Foramen of Monro (Fig. 257, 5) is the communication between the two lateral and the third ventricles. It is placed beneath the anterior part of the fornix, immediately behind its anterior pillars, and the choroid plexus has already been traced to it (Fig. 263, 10). [To see the descending cornu, the side of the brain should be freely cut through opposite the point at which the choroid plexus disappears ; this being taken as the guide, the de- scending cornu can be opened along its side, and the cavity exposed by drawing the parts asunder.] The Descending or Middle Cornu (Fig. 258) takes a curved course downward in the middle lobe of the cerebrum and beneath the optic thalamus. Its direction is at first slightly backward, and then outward, downward, forward, and inward,* and it has been said to resemble a bent fore-finger. In it will be found the continuations of Fig. 258. The Hippocampus Minor (Fig. 258, 7) is a projection of variable size from the inner wall of the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, corre- sponding to the calcarine fissure. It is white on the surface but grey in the interior. * Artificial Memory, BODFI. Fig. 258.â€”Descending comu of tlie lateral ventricle of brain (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Pes hippocampi. 6.

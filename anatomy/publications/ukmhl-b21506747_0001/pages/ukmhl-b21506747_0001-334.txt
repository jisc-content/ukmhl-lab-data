252 VISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. Fig. 136. capsular branches from the fibrous tissue of the organ, and subse- quently divide until their branches run between the minute lobules or acini, and are therefore called interlobular veins (b). The lobules are surrounded by these interlobular veins, from which the lobular plexus of capillaries is derived, converging to the centre of each lobule and pouring its blood into the intra- lobular vein (a). Each in- tralobular vein passes out of the lobule at right angles to the portal vessels, and unites with other in- tralobular veins to form the sublobular veins ; these open into the vence cavce liepaticce or hepatic veins, which have been traced into the vena cava. The appearance of a piece of minutely injected liver is shown in Fig. 135. The commencement of each primary hepatic duct is in the centre of each minute lobule, being continuous, according to Beale, with the basement membrane upon which the hepatic cells are placed. But according to other observers, the ducts commence in inter- cellular passages or biliary capillaries, with proper Avails (Fig. 137). The minute ducts run toAvards the circumference of the lobule, and the radicles of adjacent lobules unite, the resulting ducts running along the portal canals by the side of the portal vein to emerge eventually at the transverse fissure. The Hepatic artery is principally for the Fig. 137. Fig. 136.—Diagram of the circulation in the lobules of the liver (after Kieman). a, a. Intralobular veins. b, b. Interlobular veins.

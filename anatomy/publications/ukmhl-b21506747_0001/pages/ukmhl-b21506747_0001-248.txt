PART III. DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. \_Tht Student is requested to read the ‘Introduction ’ before commencing the dissection, unless he has done so previously.] Surgery.—Before the subject is tied up for the dissection of the perinseum, the student should practise the operation of introducing the catheter. In the case of the Male Subject the operator should stand on the left side of the body, and having oiled a perfectly smooth and clean staff or sound, should grasp the end of the penis with the left hand, and draw it upwards so as to stretch the urethra whilst introducing the instrument. The sound is to be held lightly in the right hand, and is to be passed at first along the fold of the groin, but when it has entered the urethra for a few inches it is to be brought parallel to the median line of the body. The introduction of an instrument is more difficult on the dead than on the living body, owing to the want of the mucous secretion of the urethra and the relaxed condition of the canal; and it is advisable therefore to withdraw the instrument and oil it afresh if any obstruction should occur. When an obstruction to entering the bladder occurs, the left hand should be placed upon the perinseum at the point to which the staff has reached, and may be made to grasp the urethra and guide the instrument in its right course. When the point of the staff has passed the bulb, the handle is to be depressed between the thighs, and the point of the instrument will probably enter the bladder. If it is found impossible to depress the handle, the student may be certain that he has failed to pass the triangular ligament, and should be very gentle in his manipulations, or he will very probably perforate the bulb. By a series of very cautious efforts, aided by the left hand on the perinseum, .the staff

THE CREMASTER. 193 To explain the formation of this muscle it will he necessary to refer to the early stage of foetal life, when the testis whs situated within the abdomen and immediately below the kidney. About the seventh month of foetal life the testis passes through the internal abdominal ring, and by the eighth month reaches the scrotum, a process of peritoneum (processus vaginalis) preceding it, and being connected with the testis by the 'plica gubernatrix. The looped fibres of the cremaster would appear to be fibres of the internal oblique drawn down by the testicle in its descent. According to Culling, a muscular band, consisting of three sets of fibres and called the gubernaculum testis, passed from the pubes to the testis, and its divisions had the following attachments—one to the bottom of the scrotum, and one, on each side of the external abdominal ring, to Poupart’s ligament and the crest of the pubes (Fig. 96). By the action of these bands the testicle.was drawn down as far as the external abdominal ring, but it is obvious that Fig. 97. Fig. 98. when it had reached this point the lateral bands must have become horizontal, and thus have lost all power of traction ; and the further progress of the testis depended therefore upon the middle band, which continued to draw the gland to the bottom of the scrotum (Fig. 97). The effect of this was to stretch the lateral bands attached to the pubes on each side, and thus they formed more or less complete loops upon the cord, and constituted the cremaster muscle, being aided by the lower fibres of the internal oblique which were drawn down by the testicle in its progress (Fig. 98). o

THE KIDNEY. 255 bunches of currants.” Each Malpighian body or plexus is enclosed in a capsule, which is continuous with a minute uriniferous tube (Fig. 140). The tube is convoluted in the cortical substance, and a secondary intertubular plexus is formed upon it by the venous radicle, after it has emerged from the Malpighian tuft. The tube then becomes suddenly smaller, and passes for a variable distance into the pyramid, again curving upon itself to reach the cortical portion, where the diameter increases and the tube opens into the straight or collecting tubes of the pyramids. These small tubes are .known as the looped tubes of Henle (Fig. 142). The uriniferous tubes of the pyramids converge at their apices, where they empty themselves into the calices ; from these the urine passes into the infundibula, and thence into the pelvis and ureter. The relation of the epithelium to the blood-vessels of the Mal- pighian body is uncertain. The capsule is lined with pave- Fig. 140.—Plan of the renal circulation (from Wilson, after Bowman). a.

38 FRONT OF THE FORE-ARM. close to the edge of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon, which can be readily felt. The External cutaneous (musculo-cutaneous) nerve (5) is distri- bute! to the outer side of the front of the fore-arm, the branches winding round the edge of the limb to join with the radial nerv.e. A cutaneous branch of the Median nerve (14) pierces the fascia in the centre of the fore-arm about two Fig. 13. inches above the wrist, and passes, into the palm of the hand. The Deep Fascia is now to be cleaned, and will be found to be continuous with the deep fascia of the arm above, and with the an- nular ligament below. It gives numerous intermuscular septa in the fore-arm, which in a thin sub- ject are seen as white lines, running more or less in the length of the limb. [The muscles from the internal condyle are to be exposed by re- moving the deep fascia from the front of the arm, and they are then to be cleaned carefully in the direc- tion of their fibres.] Fig. 13.â€”Cutaneous dissection of the front of the fore-arm (from Hirschfeld. and Reveille). 1.

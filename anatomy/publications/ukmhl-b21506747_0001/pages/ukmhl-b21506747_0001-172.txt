88 FEMORAL HERNIA. Fig. 40. ligament. Three vertical incisions, one in the centre and one at each side ol the tubular sheath, will enable the dissector to see that it is di- vided by two slender septa into three compartments, the femoral artery occupying the outermost, the femoral vein the middle, and the innermost or smallest one being occupied only by a lym- phatic gland. This last divi- . sion of the femoral sheath is the femoral or crural canal. The Femoral or Crural Ring (Fig. 41, 12).—If the finger be passed upwards along the crural canal it will enter the Crural or Femoral Ring beneath Poupart’s ligament, displacing a lymphatic gland and a little piece of subperi- toneal fat, which occupy it and form the septum crurale. The boundaries of the crural ring can be better felt than seen, and are, in front, Pou- part’s ligament, or crural arch (with occasionally a distinct band of fascia transversalis beneath it, called the deep crural arch) ; behind, the ilio-pectineal line and body of the pubes ; externally, the femoral vein separated by the septum ; and internally, the sharp margin of Gimbernat’s ligament. The crural ring is the aperture through which femoral hernia leaves the abdomen, and the point at which strangulation most commonly occurs ; the finger should therefore thoroughly explore it. The Crural or Femoral Canal (Fig. 40) is the canal, half an inch in length, along which femoral hernia descends from the crural ring to the saphenous opening ; but as soon as the hernia has forced its way through that spot, it ascends, owing to the close attachment of the Fig;. 40.—Crural sheath laid open (from Wood ‘ On Rupture ’). a.

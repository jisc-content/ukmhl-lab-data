85 FRONT OF THE THIGH. The Superficial fascia of the thigh is continuous with the superficial fascia of the abdomen over Poupart’s ligament, and generally contains a good deal of fat, particularly in the female subject. It is divisible into two layers in the upper part of the thigh, and the deep layer will be seen by reflecting the superficial layer in the same way as Fig. 39.—Superficial dissection of the inguinal and femoral regions (from Wood ‘On Rupture’). a. Superficial layer of fascia (re- flected) . b. Deeper layer of fascia (reflected), the superficial vessels being left attached to the external oblique. c. Inguinal lymphatic glands. d. Superficial circumflex iliac artery. e. Superficial epigastric artery. f. Superior external pudic artery. tj. Poupart’s ligament. h. Intercolumnar fascia. i. External abdominal ring. lc. Arciform or intercolumnar fibres of external oblique. 1. Internal saphena vein. in. Femoral lymphatic glands. n. Ilio-inguinal nerve. o. Saphenous opening.

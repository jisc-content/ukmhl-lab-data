THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK. 478 The Semispinalis (Fig. 246) is divided into the semispinalis colli and semispinalis dorsi. Semispinalis colli (u) arises from the transverse processes of the six upper dorsal vertebrae and the articular processes of the four lower cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the spines of the cervical ver- tebrae from the 2nd to the 5th inclusive. Semispinalis dorsi (io) arises from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae from the sixtli to the tenth inclusive, and is inserted into the spinous processes of the last two cervical and upper four dorsal vertebrae. Spinal Nerves (Fig. 248).—The Posterior Divisions of all the spinal nerves (with the exception of the first cervical and fourth and fifth sacral and the coccygeal) divide into internal and external branches, which supply all the muscles of the back. The Internal branches of all the cervical nerves (except the first) and of the upper six dorsal nerves become cutaneous near the spinous processes. The External branches of the lower six dorsal and of all the lumbar nerves, become cuta- neous at an oblique line corresponding to the margin of the aponeurosis of the la- tissimus dorsi. The External branches of the upper sacral nerves become cutaneous near the median line. The fourth and fifth sacral nerves are very small and join with the coc- cygeal nerve.

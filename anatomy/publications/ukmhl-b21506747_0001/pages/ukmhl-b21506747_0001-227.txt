145 THE DORSALIS PEDIS ARTERY. operation is seldom, if ever, undertaken on the living subject. As there is no definite guide to the outer border of the tibialis, it is well to make the incision a little obliquely and not less than four inches long, beginning about one inch below the head ot the fibula, at a point midway between the bone and the outer tuberosity of the tibia. The fascia should be di- vided in the same direc- tion as the skin, when, if the fore-finger is intro- duced into the wound, it will probably pass into the cellular interval between the two muscles, there being no intermuscular septum or white line to guide the operator, though these are commonly men- tioned. The tibialis anti- cus and extensor digitorum must be drawn apart, when the artery will be found upon the interosseous membrane with the nerve to its outer side. Branches of the anterior tibial artery:— The Recurrent branch arises as soon as the artery reaches the front of the leg, and winds through the fibres of the tibialis anticus to the front of the knee to anastomose with the articular arteries. Muscular branches to the adjacent muscles arise at various points. The Malleolar arteries, internal and external, the latter being the larger and more constant, pass beneath the tendons to the malleoli, in the neighbourhood of which they are distributed. The external anastomoses with the anterior peroneal artery. The Anterior Peroneal branch of the peroneal artery (page 129) appears between the tibia and fibula through an opening in the lower part of the interosseous membrane, running beneath the peroneus tertius to the outer malleolus to supply it, and to anastomose with the external malleolar artery. The Dorsalis Pedis Artery (Fig. 75, 12) is the continuation of the anterior tibial from the annular ligament to the base of the meta- Fig. 74.—Incisions for tying the anterior tibial artery and the dorsal artery of the foot (from Fergusson’s “Practical Surgery”).

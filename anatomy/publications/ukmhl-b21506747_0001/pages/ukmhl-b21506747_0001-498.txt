416 THE LARYNX. The Thyroid Cartilage (Fig. 214, i) (dvpeos ddos, like a shield) is the largest cartilage of the larynx, and consists of two halves or aloe, which meet at an angle in front and form the pomum Adami. Each ala is quadrilateral in shape, and has a rounded posterior border into which the stylo- pharyngeus and palato-pharyngeus muscles are inserted, and which is prolonged into a superior and an inferior cornu. The superior cornu is the longer of the two and is non-articular, but the inferior cornu has been seen to articulate with the cricoid cartilage, and to give attachment to the crico-tliyroid muscle. of the thyroid cartilage; and between the cricoid and the bases of the two arytcenoid cartilages. The Thyro-epiglottidean Ligament (Fig. 216, c) connects the lower border of the epiglottis with the back of the thyroid cartilage, opposite the notch in its upper border. The Hyo-epiglottidean Ligament (Fig. 216, b) is a band of yellow elastic tissue passing between the apex of the epiglottis and the upper border of the hyoid bone. Cartilages of the Larynx. [The large cartilages of the larynx, viz. the thyroid, cricoid, two arytaenoid, and the cartilage of the epiglottis, are readily re- cognised, but two pairs of minute cartilages, the cornicula laryngis and the cuneiform cartilages, are to be looked for in the arytasno- epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane.] , Fig. 217.â€”Vertical transverse section of larynx with tongue (from University College Museum). 1.

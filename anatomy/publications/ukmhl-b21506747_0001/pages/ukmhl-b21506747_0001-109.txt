21 cutaneous nerve. It is the vessel the median: cephalic vein. The Radial Vein (Fig. 5, 11) ascends on the outer side to join the median cephalic and form the Cephalic Vein (5), which passes up the outer side of the arm, between the pectoralis major and the deltoid, and has already been traced to its termination in the axillary vein. The Median Basilic Vein has important relations, since it lies su- perficially to the brachial artery, and crosses over or under the internal usually selected for venaesection on account of its size ; and protection is afforded to the artery beneath by the interposition of a process of fascia (bicipital or semilunar), which is connected with the tendon of the biceps, and may now be defined. The Median Cephalic Vein is of smaller size and crosses the tendon of the biceps, close to the outer side of which, and beneath the vein, the External Cutaneous Nerve (Fig. 5, 9) makes its appearance and supplies the adjacent parts. Above and to the outer side of the external cutaneous nerve will be found two external cutaneous branches of the Fig. 5.â€”Superficial dissection of the arm (from. Hirschfeld and Reveille). 1.

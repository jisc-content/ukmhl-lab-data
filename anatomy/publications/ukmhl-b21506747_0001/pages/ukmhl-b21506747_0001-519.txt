437 THE RIGHT AURICLE. The fossa ovalis and annulus ovalis (5) are remains of foetal structure, found on the inner wall of the right auricle, in the position of the foramen ovale, or communication between the two auricles in the foetus. The annulus ovalis is a muscular ring, which is generally well marked, and which surrounds the shallow fossa ovalis, formed by a thin membrane thrown across the foramen ovale. This membrane is Fig. 228. .—Right side of the heart laid open (from Wilson). Fig. 228 1. Cavity of right auricle. 2. Auricular appendix : in its cavity are seen the musculi pectinati. 3.

The superficial and more tendinous part arises from the anterior two-thirds of the lower border of the zygomatic arch formed Fig. 189.

The deeper and more fleshy part arises from the posterior third of the lower border of the zygoma, and also from the inner surface of the bone; it passes downwards and a little forwards to be inserted into the outer side of the upper half of the ramus of the jaw, extending to the root of the coronoid process.

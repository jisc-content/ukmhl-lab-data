MANUAL OF PRACTICAL ANATOMY. INTRODUCTION. By Practical Anatomy is meant the study of Anatomy by dissection of the dead body, in contradistinction to Descriptive Anatomy, taught by lectures, diagrams, and preparations. In dissecting, there are four principal objects to be constantly borne in mind by the student:â€”1st. The impression on the memory of those facts of general anatomy taught in the lectures. 2nd. The study of those parts of the body more especially concerned in surgical affections and operations. 3rd. The education of the sense of touch, and of the hand in the use of instruments ; and 4th, the education of the eye in the knowledge of the several tissues of the body, in various positions, and under varying circumstances. It is to assist the student in these requirements that the following work is designed; and every effort has been made to present the facts of Anatomy in such a manner, that they may be most easily grasped by the mind and retained by the memory ; it will be found also, that as far as is compatible with a work of the kind, attention is drawn to all those points which have especial interest in the practice of medicine or surgery, and directions are given for the performance of many opera- tions which do not seriously interfere with or injure the dissection. The education of the eye is a gradual and tedious process, but one which is pretty certain to be satisfactorily accompli shed if the student do but use his hands properly, and therefore a few words on the manual part of dissection may not be out of place. First, as to the INSTRUMENTS requisite for dissection. A case containing six or eight scalpels, two pairs of scissors, a pair of dissect- ing forceps, a set of chain-hooks, a blow-pipe, and a probe, will enable the student to make all requisite dissections, supposing that he is allowed the use of a saw and chisel in the dissecting-room. n

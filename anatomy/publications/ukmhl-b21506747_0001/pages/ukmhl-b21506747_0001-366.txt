284 MALE PELVIC VISCERA. be found a single tube extending along the cord and called the vas aberrans (i i). On making a section of the uninjected testis, little more can be seen than a mass of a drab colour, which may be drawn out in threads, these being the minute seminal tubes. In an injected preparation the tubes may be traced as follows (Fig. 156) :— Each lobule is composed of convoluted tubuli seminiferi (3), which anastomose with one another, and these as they emerge from the lobules become straight, and are Lcallecl vasa recta (4), about twenty in number. Entering the mediastinum, they anastomose to form the rate testis (5), which terminates in the vasa efferentia (6); and these, from twelve .to fifteen in number, pierce the tunica albuginea to form the coni vasculosi (7) of the globus major of the epididymis. The ducts are now all collected into one, which by its convolutions forms the body and globus minor of the epididymis, and ends in the vas deferens, which enters the abdomen through the inguinal canal, and has been traced to its opening into the sinus pocularis of the prostate. Attached to the top of the testis immediately in front of the epididymis may generally be found a little vesicle called the hydatid of Morgagni, the remains of Midler’s duct; and in the cellular tissue of the cord, immediately above the epididymis, may be found a small white body, which has been supposed by M. Giraldes, who first described it, to be part of the remains of the Wolffian body of the foetus. Fig. 156. Fig. 156.—Anatomy of the testis (from Wilson). 1, 1. Tunica albuginea. 2, 2.

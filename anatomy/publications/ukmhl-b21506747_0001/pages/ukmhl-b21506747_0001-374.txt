PART IV. 4 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. [The Student is requested to read the ‘ Introduction’ before commencing the dissection, unless he has done so previously.] Before beginning the dissection the student should make himself fully acquainted with the external configuration of the part, and the relation of surface-markings to deeper structures. If he has already dissected this region, he should make the incisions necessary for ex- posing the common carotid artery and the third part of the subclavian artery, and may also advantageously perform the operations of laryn- gotomy and tracheotomy, and practise extraction of the teeth and the operation for plugging the posterior nares, which last can he done with a flexible catheter. The surface of the scalp presents nothing worthy of note, hut in a well-injected body the temporal artery will he prominent, and arteriotomy may he performed upon it. The superficial appearances on the face will he described more particularly under that head, and reference may he made to that section now if time allows. In the neck, the median line is the boundary of the dissection, and presents the following prominences and depressions, which should he fully recognised with the finger. First is the symphysis of the lower jaw, next a depression corresponding to the mylo-hyoid muscle, followed by the projection of the hyoid hone, the cornua of which can he felt distinctly on each side in some subjects. The depression corresponding to the thyro-hyoid membrane and the prominent pomum Adami of the thyroid cartilage are next felt, below which are the interval of the crico-thyroid membrane and the ring of the cricoid cartilage. Below this may occasionally he felt the isthmus of the thyroid gland or body, and even the trachea in a thin subject; and on each side there is (particularly in women) the slight projection of the thyroid gland.

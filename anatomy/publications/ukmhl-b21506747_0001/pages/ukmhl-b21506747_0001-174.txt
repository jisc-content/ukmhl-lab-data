FEMORAL HERNIA. 90 skin and superficial structures having been divided (usually by a vertical incision), the forefinger can therefore be readily passed along the crural canal on the inner side of the hernia to the crural ring, where the stricture will be found. This may be most satisfactorily and safely relieved by cutting cautiously inwards with a hernia knife, so as to notch or divide Gimbernat’s liga- ment ; but if this should not prove sufficient, the sac must be carefully opened [and the stricture divided from within it. The only possible danger which can be met with in the deep inci- sion, is an abnormal distribution of the obturator artery (Figs. 43 and 44), which, if it arise from the epi- gastric artery and wind close to the inner side of the neck of the sac, might be divided and give rise to troublesome haemorrhage. Fortu- nately this vessel, if it exists, is seldom damaged by a cautious use of the knife, and, as it is impossible tc ascertain its presence beforehand, its existence may be ignored in practice. [The cutaneous nerves of the upper part of the front of the thigh are to be examined with the fascia lata, before it is removed to expose Scarpa’s triangle.] The Fascia lata of the thigh is a dense white membrane attached to Poupart’s ligament and the crest of the ilium above, and to the pubes internally, and will be afterwards seen to enclose and support all the muscles of the thigh. Cutaneous nerves (Fig. 45).—The Ilio-inguinal nerve, which emerges from the external abdominal ring, gives one or two small branches to the thigh.

242 VISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. The Duodenum (Fig. 119) should he laid open along its free border, in order to see the opening of the bile ami pancreatic ducts, which is marked by a papilla situated at the back of the vertical portion of the intestine, and about or below its middle. A probe should be passed into the orifice and along the pancreatic duct. The duodenum is from eight to ten inches long, and has a special struc- ture (Brunner’s glands) in addition to the ordinary characteristics of the small intestine. Valvulce conniventes (or valves of Kerkring) are transverse folds of mucous membrane, which will be seen to commence a little beyond the pylorus, and to increase in size at the lower part of the duo- denum. Villi (Fig. 127, i) are the minute projections from the surface of Fig. 123. Fig. 124. Fig. 123.—An intestinal villus (from Frey). a. Columnar epithelium. c. Muscular fibres. b. Capillary plexus. d.

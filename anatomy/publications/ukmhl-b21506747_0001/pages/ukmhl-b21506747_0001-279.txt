197 INGUINAL HERNIA. the transversalis muscle, and the interval between that muscle and the internal oblique. Inguinal Hernia is of two kinds, oblique and direct. Oblique passes through the internal abdominal ring, along the inguinal canal, and out of the external ring. Direct breaks through or pushes before it the posterior wall of the inguinal canal at its lower part in Hessel- bach’s triangle, i.e., the space bounded by the epigastric artery, the rectus, and Poupart’s ligament, and emerges at the external ring, thus taking a more direct course than the oblique variety. The coverings of each hernia will be best seen by tracing them from within outwards ; thus oblique hernia would have (1) peri- toneal sac ; (2) in coming through the internal ring it would have the fascia transversalis, or infundibular fascia ; (3) in passing beneath the internal oblique it would have the cremaster muscle, the fibres of which are united by cellular tissue and are sometimes known as the cremasteric fascia ; in emerging from the external ring it would have (4) the intercolumnar or spermatic fascia, and (5) the superficial fascia and skin. Direct hernia would have, (1) the peritoneum, and (2) the fascia transversalis, (for both line the abdomen) ; then pushing into the inguinal canal it would have a covering (3) from the conjoined tendon ; and lastly emerging from the external ring, it would have (4) the intercolumnar or spermatic fascia, and (5) the superficial Pig. 101.

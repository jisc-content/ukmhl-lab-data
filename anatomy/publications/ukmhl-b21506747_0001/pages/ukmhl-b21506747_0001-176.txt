92 SCARPA’S TRIANGLE. the adductor longus ; and the apex of the triangle is formed by the meeting of the two above-named muscles. The space has been seen to be covered in by the superficial fascia and fascia lata, and its floor will now be seen to be formed by the psoas and iliacus on the outer side? the pectineus and adductor longus on the inner side, with (in some subjects) a small portion of the adductor brevis between the two. Scarpa’s triangle contains the Tig- 45. upper part of the femoral artery and vein with their branches ; the origin of the profunda artery with its vein ; the anterior crural nerve with some of its brandies ; and the termination of the saphena vein. The saphena vein itself is not one of the contents of the space, since it originally was superficial t.o the fascia lata. The Femoral Artery in Scarpa’s Triangle (Fig. 45, 4). —The femoral arteiy is the con- tinuation of the external iliac 1 artery, and extends from Poupart’s ligament to the opening in the adductor magnus, through which Fig. 45.—Superficial dissection of the front of the thigh (from Ilirschfeld and Reveille). 1.

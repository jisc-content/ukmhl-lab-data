475 THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY. of the preceding muscle. It arises from the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into a mark above or outside the outer part of the inferior curved line of the occipital bone, externally to the corn- plexus and overlapping the rectus major. The occipital artery has been seen to run along the upper border of this muscle. The recti muscles draw the head backward, and the rectus major, owing to its oblique direction, assists slightly in producing rotation. The obliqui produce rotation, the inferior oblique rotating the atlas upon the axis ; the muscle of one side acting with the supe- rior oblique of the other, which latter acts slightly upon the skull. Vertebral Artery (Fig. 247, 5). — The horizontal portion of the vertebral artery will be found in the triangle formed by the rectus posticus major and the two oblique muscles. It ascends through the foramina in the transverse pro- cesses of the vertebrae, beginning at the sixth, and having perforated the atlas is seen to wind in the groove beliind the superior articular process of that bone, and pierce the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament to enter the vertebral canal. Lastly it reaches the interior of the skull through the foramen magnum. Wliile in the transverse pro- cesses the artery gives small branches to the muscles and to the spinal cord, and in its horizontal portion it occasionally gives off a branch to the back of the skull to supply the muscles. The Vertebral vein does not accompany the artery in this part of Fig. 247. Fig. 247.—Suboccipital region (drawn by J. T. Gray). 1. Occipital artery and nerve piercing trapezius. 2. Trapezius. 3.

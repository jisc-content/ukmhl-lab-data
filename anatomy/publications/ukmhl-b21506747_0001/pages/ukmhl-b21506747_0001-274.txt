Fig. 96. then be exposed, and will be most readily cleaned by beginning at the lower border of the muscle on the right side, and at the upper border on the left side of the subject.] The Obliquus Internus (Fig. 94, 7).—The fibres of this muscle take the opposite direction to those of the obliquus externus, and therefore have their origin below and their insertion chiefly above. The origin is from the anterior two-thirds of the middle of the crest of the ilium ; from the outer half of Poupart’s liga- ment ; and slightly from the fascia lumborum. The upper fibres pass to be inserted into the cartilages of the last four ribs, and into the linea alba by an aponeurosis, which is split to enclose the rectus and form its sheath, as will be afterwards seen; while the lower fibres, becoming gradually more and more horizontal in their course to the middle line, in the end arch downwards to help to form the conjoined tendon, and to be inserted into the crest of the pubes and the ilio-pectineal line. In the male subject, some pale muscular fibres will be found to be continuous with the lower border of the internal oblique, and to overlie the spermatic cord, forming the cremaster muscle. The Cremaster (Fig. 100, h), consists of a series of thin muscular loops spread over the spermatic cord. It is attached externally to the inner end of Poupart's ligament, where it is continuous with the internal oblique, and internally to the spine and crest of the pubes. In addition to the loops, there are a few muscular fibres on each side of the spermatic cord connected with the cremasteric fascia. The cremaster is supplied by the genital branch of the genito-crural nerve. Figs. 96, 97, 98.—Diagrams to illustrate the descent of the testis and the forma- tion of the tunica vaginalis (drawn by J.

The ligamentum arcuatum externum is only the artificially isolated border of the fascia covering the quadratus lumborum, which is the Fig. 115. anterior lamella of the fascia lumborum derived from the posterior tendon of the transversalis abdominis muscle (Fig. 108). The ligamentum arcuatum internum is formed solely by the poste- rior tendinous fibres of the crus of the diaphragm, and to it the fascia of the psoas is attached. The crura or pillars of the diaphragm arise from the front of the bodies of the upper lumbar vertebrae; the right crus is the larger, Fig. 115.â€”Under or abdominal surface of the diaphragm (from Wilson). 1.

492 DUCTLESS GLANDS Lymph glands, see p. 313 ; pineal body, see p. 337; hypophysis (pituitary body), see p. 335. Lien (Spleen).—5 in. long, 3 in. broad, 1L2 in. thick. Lies obliquely, behind stomach, in left hypochondrium and adjoining part of epigastrium, opposite 9th, 10th, nth ribs. Long axis coincides with that of 10th ; posterior border corresponds to lower border of nth; anterior projecting angle reaches the level of mid-axillary line. Surfaces.—Diaphragmatic: large, convex; separated by diaphragm (1) from lower intercostal muscles, (2) from pleura above that, and, in its upper part, (3) from lung. Gastric : concave; separ- ated from postero-inferior surface of stomach, near fundus, by gastro- splenic ligament (omentum). Renal : slightly concave ; applied to upper part of anterior surface of left kidney, near lateral border. Base rests on splenic flexure of colon and phrenico-colic ligament. Borders : Anterior is sharp and notched, and ends below in prominent anterior angle. Posterior and inferior, smooth and blunt. Borders separating gastric and renal surfaces and base are rounded off. At their meeting-point, and encroaching on gastric surface, is a depression for tail of pancreas. Hilum, interrupted and irregular, is situated on posterior part of gastric surface. Spleen is almost completely surrounded by peritoneum. Gastro- splenic and lieno - renal ligaments, attached in neighbourhood of hilum, connect it with stomach and kidney. Blood-vessels : Splenic branch of coeliac artery. Splenic vein joins v. portae. Nerves : from splenic plexus. Lymphatics end in splenic glands near hilum, and in left supra-pancreatic glands. Small, globular accessory spleens are sometimes found in neighbourhood of spleen.

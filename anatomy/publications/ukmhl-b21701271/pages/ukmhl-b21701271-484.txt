Kidneys lie in upper part of abdomen proper; ureters, in abdomen proper and in pelvis; bladder, in pelvis ; urethra, in pelvis and perineum ; and, in the male, it traverses penis also. Ren (Kidney).—Reddish brown in colour, bean-shaped, smooth ; about 4^ in. long, 2\ in. broad, \\ in. thick ; weighs about 4^ oz. Relatively much larger in new-born than in adult. Upper end, nearer median plane than lower end, and usually bulkier. Anterior surface, directed ventrally and laterally, often raised in middle and sloping to each end, especially in left kidney. Posterior surface, directed dorsally and medially. Lateral border, convex. Medial border, concave, presents a vertical slit, called hilum, through which arteries and nerves enter ; lymphatics, veins, ureter leave. Hilum leads into space in interior, called sinus renalis, which contains fat, calyces, pelvis of ureter, and the vessels and nerves before their entrance into or after emergence from substance of kidney. Position.—Kidneys lie on upper part of post, wall of abdomen behind peritoneum, opposite 12th TH. and upper 3 L. vertebrae. Right kidney usually reaches to level of upper border of last rib, left kidney to lower border of nth rib ; but they may be on same level, or left may be lower. Lower end is i in. to 2 in. above iliac crest, and is

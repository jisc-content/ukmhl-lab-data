417 27 RESPIRATORY APPARATUS Aik drawn into the two lungs by movements of inspiration passes successively through the cavities of nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea or windpipe, and the two bronchi, into which trachea divides. Nasal cavities are situated in the head, pharynx in head and neck, larynx in neck, trachea in neck and thorax, bronchi in thorax, lungs in thorax and root of neck. The lungs are covered by membrane called pleura. Nose and Nasal Cavities.—See Organs of the Senses, p. 403. Pharynx.—See Digestive Apparatus, p. 446. LARYNX The organ of voice, situated below hyoid bone and tongue, between carotid sheaths, and, reckoning tip of epi- glottis as upper end, in front of 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th cervical vertebrae, separated from them by pharynx and pre-vertebral muscles. In relation antero-laterally with thyreoid gland and depressors of hyoid, and overlapped by sterno-mastoid. In foetus it is opposite 3rd and 4th c. vertebrae. Gradually descends till puberty. Position varies with movements of head, and during deglutition and vocalisation. CARTILAGES OF LARYNX Unpaired : thyreoid, cricoid, epiglottic. Paired : arytae- noid, corniculate, cuneiform. Thyreoid Cartilage.—Two quadrilateral laminae. Anterior borders fused below, separated by incisura thyreoidea above.

72 OSTEOLOGY Diameters of Superior Aperture.—(i) A ntero-posterior {conjugate), from middle of sacral promontory to upper margin of symphysis. (2) Transverse, across aperture where it is widest. (3) Oblique, from one sacro iliac joint to the opposite ilio-pectineal eminence. Diameters of Cavity.—(1) Antcro-postcn'or, from centre of 3rd piece of sacrum to middle of pelvic surface of symphysis. (2) Trans- verse, between pelvic surfaces of ischia, bisecting antero-posterior diameter at right angles. (3) Oblique, from lower margin of one sacro-iliac joint to very near centre of opposite obturator membrane. Diameters of Inferior Aperture.—(1) Antero-posterior, from tip of coccyx to lower margin of symphysis. (2) Transverse, between medial margins of ischial tubers, bisecting antero-posterior diameter at right angles, but on a lower plane. (3) Oblique, from intersection of sacro-tuberous and sacro-spinous ligaments (great and small sacro-sciatic) of one side to junction of rami of ischium and pubis of opposite side.

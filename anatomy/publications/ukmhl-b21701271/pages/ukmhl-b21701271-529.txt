5'9 LIMBS of upper limb becomes lateral, and extensor surface dorsal ; pre-axial border of lower limb becomes medial, and extensor surface ventral. Limb girdles share in rotation. Central mesoderm in each limb condenses to form a membranous skeleton, which chondrifies in 5th week—except where joints are to be formed—and a cartilaginous skeleton is produced. Ossification in large bones begins during 7th and 8th weeks. Where a joint is formed, the periphery of the central condensed mesoderm becomes the fibrous stratum of the articular capsule ; central part, to a large extent, disappears and the joint cavity is formed ; but a part remains as the syncrvial stratum ; and sometimes part is retained as interarticular discs and ligaments.

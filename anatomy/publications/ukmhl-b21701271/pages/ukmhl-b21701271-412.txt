402 NEUROLOGY art.; supplies right atrium and ventricle. Post, coronary plexus, formed by branches from both halves of deep plexus, accompanies left coronary art., supplies left atrium and ventricle. Cceliac Plexus (Solar or Epigastric Plexus).—A large plexus lying in front of upper part of abdominal aorta and crura of diaphragm, behind stomach, pancreas, and omental bursa (lesser sac of peritoneum), and vena cava. Surrounds coeliac artery ; sends large plexuses into suprarenal glands. Subsidiary plexuses from it accompany and surround inf. phrenic, suprarenal, renal, cceliac, superior mesenteric arteries and their branches, and are joined by branches of vagi. It is continued downwards over aorta as aortic plexus, from which a plexus accompanies inferior mesenteric and its branches. Plexus on spermatic or ovarian artery is derived from aortic and renal plexuses. Renal plexus is joined by lowest splanchnic nerve. Cceliac Ganglion (Semilunar).—Largest peripheral ganglion in the body. J to i inch in diameter. Irregular and lobulated. Lies on crus of diaphragm, medial to suprarenal gland, at side of coeliac artery. The right ganglion is overlapped by vena cava, the left by the pancreas. Branches of cceliac plexus are derived from it. Greater and lesser splanchnic; nerves end in it. Hypogastric Plexus.—Lies on promontory of sacrum, between common iliac arteries. Formed by a continuation of aortic plexus, and by branches which descend from sympathetic trunks in front of common iliac arteries. It divides into two pelvic plexuses. These subdivide into plexuses which accompany iliac and hypogastric (internal iliac) arteries and their branches, receive their names and are distributed with them. White rami communicantes from 3rd and 4th sacral nerves, and branches from sacral ganglia join them.

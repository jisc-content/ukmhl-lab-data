24 OSTEOLOGY foetal week, first in 6th and 7th ribs. Three secondary centres, one for head, one for articular part and one for non-articular part of tubercle, appear at puberty and have joined at 25. nth and 12th ribs have no centre for tubercle. CART1 LAG1N ES COSTALES Bars of hyaline cartilage fitted into pits at anterior ends of ribs ; held there by continuity of periosteum and perichondrium. 1st cartilage is directly continuous with bony tissue of manubrium, and articular disc of sterno-clavicular joint is attached to junction. 2nd to 7th articulate with sternum by diarthrodial joints. 8th, 9th, 10th are indirectly connected with sternum through their border-to- border diarthrodial articulation with one another and with 7th. Ilth and 12th lie free among muscles of flank. They increase in length from 1st to 7th, and are successively shorter below that. 1st descends obliquely, 2nd is almost horizontal. 3rd to 10th continue direction of ribs for a short distance, increasing from above downwards, and then incline upwards and medially to their terminations, nth and 12th lie in the direction of their ribs. 10th forms lowest point of outlet of thorax, as seen from front. A line from a little behind this point to side of upper part of manubrium passes through or near junction of cartilages with ribs.

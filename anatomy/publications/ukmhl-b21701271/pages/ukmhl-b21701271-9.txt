I PRE FACE This book has been written to provide, in an easily portable form, an account of naked-eye Anatomy, expressed in terms of the Basle nomenclature. To ensure comprehensiveness, and to avoid the extensive use of small type, it has been necessary to employ very condensed language, and to shorten some of the terms that frequently occur ; e.g., inferior is contracteil into inf., and external into ext. This method has its drawbacks ; but, as the book is intended, primarily, to assist the student in the revision of his work, it is hoped that no one who has already been over the ground, with the aid of a dissecting manual, will have any difficulty in understanding the statement of fact, though the fact is stated in a compressed form. The book is meant to be used as a companion to a dissecting manual, for revision of work while the dissection of a “ part ” is in progress ; and the various structures are dealt with under their systems, in order that the dissector shall not lose sight of the fact that each structure may be found in other regions besides that which, at the moment, is engaging his attention. But the book may be used also for revision after the dissection of the body is completed ; and, as the “ regional ” method of study should never be abandoned, there has been included, in small type, a full account of the relations in the more important “ regions,” such as the Triangles of the Neck, etc. It is hoped that the usefulness of the book will be increased by the accounts given of the relations of the structures in the “ boundary ” regions, such as the Inguinal Ligament, the relations of the joints, and the relationship of articular capsules to the epiphyseal lines of v

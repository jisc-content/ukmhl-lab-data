OSTEOLOGY 86 Ossification. — Tarsus : centre for calcaneus, 6th month, talus, 8th month, cuboid, at birth. Third cuneiform, ist year, second cuneiform, 2nd or 3rd year, first cuneiform and navicular, 3rd or 4th year. Epiphyseal centre for tuber calcanei, 7th to 9th year. Ossification completed, 16 to 20. Posterior process of talus may have separate centre, and may remain separate as os trigonum. Metatarsus.—Centre for shaft and base of second, third, fourth, fifth, early in 3rd foetal month. Epiphyseal centre for head, 2nd to 4th year ; fuses at 18. Centre for shaft and head of first in 3rd month. Epiphyseal centre for base, 2nd or 3rd year, fuses at 18. Epiphyseal lines are extra-capsular. Phalanges.—Centre for shaft and head of third at end of 3rd month, of first at end of 4th month, of second of second and third toes during 6th month, of fourth toe at birth, fifth toe after birth. Epiphyseal centres for bases about 4th year ; fuse from 16 to 18, those of first phalanges before others. Epiphyseal lines are extra-capsular. Ossa Sesamoidea.—Two small nodules in tendon of flexor hallucis brevis and one in peronteus longus.

Sesamoids of hand are usually very small.

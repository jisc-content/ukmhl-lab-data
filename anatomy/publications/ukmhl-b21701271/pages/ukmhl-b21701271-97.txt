87 SYNDESMOLOGY (ARTICULATIONS) BONES may be united in five different ways and the joints formed between them are classified, according to the mode of union, as : (i) Synostosis, (2) Suture, (3) Syndesmosis, (4) Synchondrosis, (5) Diarthrosis. Synostosis. Immovable. The coalescence of two bones originally united by (a) fibrous tissue, e.g. two halves of mandible, and two halves of frontal bone ; or by (b) cartilage, e.g. basilar part of occipital and body of sphenoid. Suture. — Practically immovable. Found in the skull. Articulating edges or surfaces of bones are connected by intervening sutural membrane, which is continuous by its edges with periosteum on both surfaces of the bones. Ossification occurs in this membrane till sutures have disappeared and the bones have coalesced—synostosis. Some coalesce early, e.g. halves of frontal bone ; some persist till advanced age. Varieties.—A. so rata, between bones with serrated or denticulated edges, e.g. inter-parietal. S. squamosa, between bones with overlapping edges — parietal and squamous temporal. Harmotiia, between plane surfaces, e.g. inter- maxillary. Union between root of a tooth and its socket is allied to suture and is termed gomphosis. Syndesmosis. Union by intervening interosseous liga- ment, permitting slight yielding movement, e.g. distal ends of tibia and fibula. Synchondrosis.—Two varieties : 1. Bones united by intervening plate of hyaline cartilage, perichondrium of which is continuous with periosteum on each side. They are formed between : (1) basi-occiput and body'of sphenoid ; (2) ethmoid and body of sphenoid ; (3) petrous temporal and

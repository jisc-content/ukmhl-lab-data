COMPANION 1 i TO MANUAL OF PRACTICAL ANATOMY OSTEOLOGY The mammalian skeleton consists of: i an exo-skeleton, comprising hair, feathers, scales, armour plates, nails, teeth, etc. ; (2) an endo-skeleton, comprising bones with their cartilages and ligaments ; (3) a splanchnic skeleton, which may be included in endo-skeleton, and comprises the cartilages of larynx, trachea and bronchi, and the os cordis and os penis of certain mammals. The endo-skeleton forms the framework of the body, supports the softer structures, muscles, etc., which surround it, and protects organs within the cavities of the body. It is divided into an axial skeleton, belonging to head, neck and trunk, and an appendicular skeleton, belonging to the extremities or limbs. The bones and the costal cartilages of the endo-skeleton are dealt with under Osteology. Bones provide attachments and support for muscles and their tendons, ligaments, fibrous membranes and fascia.-. They articulate with each other to form joints, and are the passive levers in the movements at joints, and by means of them precision is given to movements. Theyare protectiveagentsto viscera, vessels, central, and parts of peripheral, nervous system ; and, in virtue of their marrow, they are blood-forming organs. The surfaces of bones which touch one another, in an articulation, are coated with permanent articular cartilage. I n the preparation of dried specimens, used in reading, this cartilage has been removed.

318 NEUROLOGY The nervous system brings all parts of the body into association with one another. It consists of a central and a peripheral system. Central nervous system consists of (i) the Brain or Encephalon, situated in the cranial cavity, and (2) the Spinal medulla (spinal cord), situated in the vertebral canal. Brain and spinal medulla are continuous with each other at the foramen magnum. They are built up of nerve cells, nerve fibres, and a supporting tissue called neuroglia. The brain consists of (1) cerebrum (including mesen- cephalon), (2) cerebellum, (3) pons, (4) medulla oblongata, the last three occupying the posterior cranial fossa, below tentorium cerebelli. Peripheral nervous system consists of (1) cerebral and spinal nerves and their ganglia, and (2) the sympathetic system. The brain is divided into rhombencephalon and cerebrum. The rhombencephalon is derived from the posterior primary cerebral vesicle and is divided into myelencephalon and meten- cephalon. The myelencephalon is the medulla oblongata. The meten- cephalon consists of pons and cerebellum. The cerebrum is divided into mesencephalon or mid-brain, derived from the middle primary vesicle, and the prosencephalon, derived from the anterior primary vesicle. The prosencephalon is divided into diencephalon and telencephalon. Diencephalon consists of the pars mamillaris hypothalami and thalamencephalon. Pars mamillaris hypothalami consists of mamillary bodies and walls of 3rd ventricle below sulcus hypothalamicus. Thalamencephalon includes: (1) thalamus;

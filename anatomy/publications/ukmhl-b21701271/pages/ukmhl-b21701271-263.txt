253 BLOOD VASCULAR SYSTEM Heart, the propulsive organ ; arteries, the tubes or vessels through which blood is sent from heart; veins, the vessels through which blood returns to heart ; capillaries, the microscopic vessels in which arteries end and veins begin. COR (THE HEART) The heart is a hollow muscular organ, completely sub- divided by 2 septa into right and left halves. Each half con- sists of (i) atrium (O.T. auricle), which receives blood from veins ; and (2) ventricle, which propels blood into arteries. Sulcus coronarius, a shallow groove encircling heart at right angles to its long axis, indicates, on surface, the subdivision into atria and ventricles. Separation of atrial part into halves is indicated on surface, only at base of heart, by indistinct sulcus. Separation of ventricular part is indicated on surface by definite anterior and inferior longitudinal sulci. Ear-shaped ventral prolongations of atria are called right and left auricles (O.T. auricular appendices). Right atrium receives impure blood from almost every part of body, by two large veinsâ€”venae cavae, superior et inferior, and from substance of heart by sinus coronarius and some small veins. Contraction of atrium sends blood into right ventricle through a large aperture, guarded by a valve to prevent return of blood into atrium. Right ventricle, by contracting, propels impure blood, received from atrium, into a large artery called the pulmonary artery, which divides into right and left branches, called right and left pulmonary arteries. These convey blood to lungs to be oxygenated. Right and left pulmonary veins,

494 EMBRYOLOGY FORMATION OF THE EMBRYO The mature ovum is the female gamete. The spermatozoon is the male gamete. Fertilisation is the union of male and female gametes. Fertilised ovum is the zygote, which divides again and again to produce a mass of cells called morula, from which both embryo and embryonic appendages are developed. Outermost layer of morula is the trophoblast; remainder is the inner cell mass. They become separated by fluid, except at one pole ; and morula becomes the blastula, which consists of a single-celled sac, the trophoblast, enclosing fluid and a collection of cells, the inner cell mass, adherent to the trophoblast at one pole. Cavities appear in inner cell mass and divide it into two sacs, placed one above the other and adherent to one another ; the upper sac is adherent by its upper surface to trophoblast also ; it encloses the amniotic cavity ; and cells forming its walls are called ectoderm. '1'he cells of the other sac are called entoderm, and it develops into (i) primitive alimentary canal and (2) yolk sac, or umbilical vesicle. The region where the sacs are adherent to one another is called the embryonic area, because the embryo develops there. Embryonic area is a plate consisting of a dorsal or upper layer of ectoderm and a ventral layer of entoderm. At first it is circular, and then egg- shaped, the large end being the cephalic end. In human zygote, as soon as embryonic area is defined, mesoderm is present in both intra- and extra-embryonic regions. It fills the space between trophoblast and the inner two sacs, and passes in between the two sacs, and therefore is present to some extent in embryonic area. This condition seems to be peculiar to human development. Soon after the embryonic area becomes distinct a median linear streak is visible in its caudal part. This is the primitive streak. In it, ectoderm and mesoderm are closely bound

>38 MUSCLES AND FASCI/E across the groove, and from lateral intermuscular septum. (3) Medial keadifi.-tend.), from post, surface of humerus from olecranon fossa to insertion of teres major, and from lateral and medial intermuscular septa. Radial (musculo-spiral) nerves run distally and laterally between long and medial heads to lie in groove, between medial and lateral heads. Insertion : by tendon, separated from posterior ligament of elbow by bursa, into posterior area on proximal surface of olecranon, and by expansion into fascia on each side. Nerve : c. 7, 8, through radial (musculo-spiral). It extends forearm ; long head extends and adducts arm. Subanconaeus consists of a few of deeper fibres of triceps which arise from distal part of posterior surface of humerus and are inserted into fibrous capsule of elbow, and pull it away during extension. FASCIAE AND MUSCLES OF FOREARM AND HAND Superficial fascia of antibrachium or forearm contains: (1) small unnamed cutaneous vessels; (2) median vein, along middle of volar (anterior) surface, dividing at cubital fossa into median-basilic and median-cephalic ; (3) basilic vein, along ulnar border ; (4) cephalic vein, along radial border ; (5) volar and dorsal branches of musculo cutaneous nerve, along volar and dorsal aspects of radial border of forearm ; (6) volar and ulnar branches of medial cutaneous n. of forearm (int. cutaneous), along volar and dorsal aspects of ulnar border ; (7) dorsal cutaneous n. of forearm, along middle of dorsum of forearm ; (8) superficial branch of radial n., after it pierces deep fascia, proximal to wrist at its radial side. Fascia Antibrachii (Deep Fascia of Forearm).—Invests forearm ; continuous with fascia of arm and strengthened by expansion from tendon of triceps and by lacertus fibrosus (bicipital fascia). Attached to olecranon and dorsal margin of ulna. Sends in septa between muscles. Continuous with fascia of hand, and is thickened at wrist to form two ligaments which hold tendons in position and also assist in binding together the bones to which they are attached :— (1) Transverse Carpal Lig. (Anterior Annular).—Very thick and strong. Bridges across carpal groove, converting it into tunnel. Attached medially to pisiform and hook of os hamatum (unciform), laterally to tuberosity of navicular and volar surface and ridge of multangulum majus (trapezium). A special band of fascia, passing from volar surface of ligament to pisiform superficially, bridges across ulnar vessels and nerve, and is called volar carpal lig. (see also p. 147).

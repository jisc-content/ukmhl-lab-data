MUSCLES AND FASCIAE 142 membrane. Nerve : c. 7, 8, T. r, through volar interosseous. It pronates forearm. Short Muscles of Thumb and Little Finger and Interosseous Muscles.â€”See Palm of Hand. MUSCLES ON DORSUM AND LATERAL SIDE OF FOREARM (1) Superficial Muscles Brachio-radialis (supinator longus) lies on radial side of forearm anteriorly and forms lateral boundary of cubital fossa. Origin (fl.): anterior aspect of proximal % of lateral epicon- dylic line of humerus and intermuscular septum. Insertion : by tendon into proximal part of lateral surface of distal end of radius, under cover of tendons of abductor longus and extensor brevis pollicis. Nerve : c. 5, 6, through radial (musculo-spiral). It flexes forearm and initiates supination and pronation. Extensor carpi radialis longus lies on radial border of forearm, dorsal to brachio-radialis. Origin (fl.) : anterior aspect of distal ^ of lateral epicondylic line and intermuscular septum. Its tendon is crossed by abductor longus and extensors of thumb ; is enclosed with ext. carp. rad. brevis in mucous sheath under dorsal carpal lig. (post, annular), on dorsum of radius ; and is inserted iqto base of 2nd metacarpal. Nerve : c. 6, 7, through radial (musculo-spiral). It extends and abducts hand, and slightly flexes elbow. Common Extensor Origin. -Extensores carpi radialis brevis, digitorurn communis, digiti quinti proprius, carpi ulnaris arise partly or wholly by a common origin, consisting of (a) a tendon attached to distal part of anterior surface of lateral epioondyle, (b) fascia covering and between muscles. Extensor carpi radialis brevis lies on radial side and dorsum of forearm. Origin : common extensor origin and radial collateral ligament of elbow. Its tendon runs along ulnar side of longus and is inserted into base of 3rd meta- carpal, and usually also into 2nd. Nerve : c. 6, 7, through deep branch of radial (post, interosseous of musculo-spiral). It extends and slightly abducts hand. Extensor digitorurn communis lies on dorsal surface of forearm, towards radial side. Common extensor origin.

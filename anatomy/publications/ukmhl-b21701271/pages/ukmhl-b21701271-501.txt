491 MAMMARY GLANDS middle, opposite 4th intercostal space, and is surrounded by pigmented patch, called areola. Corpus mammae is made up of 15 to 20 lobes of gland substance, which converge towards nipple and are subdivided peripherally. Fibrous tissue surrounding them sends processes to be attached to skin. Fat covers the gland and fills up inequalities of its surface ; is most abundant in lower lateral part, but is absent from areola and nipple. Ductus lactiferus of each lobe ends on summit of nipple. Under areola it is dilated—sinus lactiferus. Arteries : from internal mammary, lateral thoracic, intercostals. Veins end in internal mammary and axillary, a few in ext. jugular. Nerves : from 4th, 5th, 6th intercostals. Lymphatics : from lateral §, end in pectoral glands and thence in lateral axillary ; from medial J, in sternal glands ; from deep aspect, in infra-clavicular and in lower deep cervical glands. Lymph vessels of the 2 mamma communicate across median plane ; and some, on each side, pass down to the angle between rectus abdominis and 9th cartilage, enter abdomen and anastomose with lymph vessels in extra-peritoneal tissue.

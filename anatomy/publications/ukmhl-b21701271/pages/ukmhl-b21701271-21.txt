ATTACHMENTS TO VERTEBRAE i r Special Characters.—Dorsal surface of body of first is often deeper than ventral ; in second, they are of equal depth. Transverse process of third is usually the longest, and encroaches on root of arch ; and ventral surface of body is deeper than dorsal. Ventral surface of body of fourth is deeper than dorsal; transverse process encroaches on root of arch and may reach body ; inferior articular processes are as wide apart as the superior. Fifth lumbar vertebra is the largest of all vertebra:. Ventral surface of body is much deeper than dorsal. Boots of arch run later- ally and dorsally. Transverse process is short, stout and pyramidal, ts base encroaching well on to body. Spine is short, and rounded at free end. Superior articular processes look more dorsally and less medially than in other L. vertebrae ; inf. artic. processes are further apart than superior, and look more ventrally and less laterally than in other lumbar vertebra:.

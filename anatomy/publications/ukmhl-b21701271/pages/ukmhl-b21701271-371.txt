MENINGES OF BRAIN & SPINAL MEDULLA 361 tudinal band called linea splendens. Pia is attached to posterior median septum, and is prolonged as slender filament, 10 inches long, called filum terminale, from end of spinal medulla to dorsum of coccyx ; lower part of filum is en- sheathed in dura. Pia provides sheaths for roots of spinal nerves as they pierce it. Posteriorly the spinal pia is connected with arachnoid, in median plane, by an imperfect septum subarachnoideale. On each side, between anterior and posterior nerve-roots, a longitudinal toothed ridge, called ligamentum denticulatum, is attached to pia and suspends spinal medulla in middle of dural tube. The 20 to 22 teeth -push arachnoid before them and are attached to dura in intervals between spinal nerves. First tooth is attached between vertebral art. and accessory n., at for. magnum. Last is attached at level of body of 1 st lumbar vertebra.

ON THE EFFECTS OF THE ANATOMY ACT, AND THE FACILITIES FOR THE STUDY OF PEACTICAL ANATOMY IN GLASGOW. BY GEOKGE BUCHANAN, A.M., M.D. The medical traveller who has visited the Hague, could not fail to have been struck with one of the paintings in the Museum or Picture Gallery. It is a masterpiece of Rembrandt, unique in the subject, and imexcelled in execution and colouring. The subject chosen is curious, and requires all the talent of the painter to make it even tolerable to the public eye. It is an anatomical de- monstration. The professor (Tulp) stands at the side of a dissect- ing table, on which a body is lying, and holds in his forceps one of the superficial muscles of the fore-arm, which, for obvious rea- sons, is the only part of the dissection exposed. The students, who are grouped around the table, are listening with great eagerness, a perfect pattern to those who now have such facilities for dissec- tion ; and the whole picture is a valuable, though unintentional, record of the time when dissection was the privilege of the teacher only, the pupil learning his anatomy by watching the perforaiance of his master. It also recalls to our mind the necessity that at one time existed for those who wished to have a complete sur- gical education, to repair to continental schools for what was denied to them in this country, or at least was obtained witli the penalties of the law hanging over their heads, and it presents a striking contrast to the advantages enjoyed by the student of the present day. In the last number of this Journal there was a paper,* in which the claims of Glasgow as a school of medicine were prominently set forth, principally in reference to the large field for study prc- * Tlic Miidical Scliool of Glasgow.

40 DISSECTION OF THE ARM. cutaneous nerve, 1 ; and it ends in the integuments over the back of the elbow. Offsets are directed backwards to the fat and skin of the lower part of the posterior surface of the arm ; and one or two communicate with the large internal cutaneous nerve. In this body the nerve was large, and was placed rather farther forwards than usual. The external cutaneous nerve, 3, or the terminal part of the musculo-cutaneous (Plate ii., 11), appears at the bend^^^ tbe^ elbow beneath the median cephalic .vein,^^Nand is distributed along the radial side of the forcOT^^sTS^ as^t!ie*]Sairof^the thumb. The median nerve, 8, is continued to the fingers. At the upper part of the dissection it lies inside and near the brachial artery, but opposite the bend of the elbow it begins to incline inwards from that vessel. In the lower as in the upper part of the arm the nerve serves to guide the surgeon to the situation of the large vessel of the limb. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE IT. The relative position of the muscles, vessels, and nerves of the inner side of the arm, after the removal of the integuments and the deep fascia, is shown in this Plate. The skin may be reflected in two flaps to the sides, by an incision along the centre of the arm, with a cross-cut at each end. In the fat the superficial nerves and vessels are to be found; and then the remains of the fat, and the deep fascia, should be taken away. A small part of the fascia has been left near the elbow, for the purpose of marking its position to the superficial veins and the lymphatic glands. SURFACE MARKING OF THE ARM. Along the front of the arm is the well-marked muscular pro- minence so evident in the Plate. Before the removal of the integuments and fascia, this eminence seems to the feel to be

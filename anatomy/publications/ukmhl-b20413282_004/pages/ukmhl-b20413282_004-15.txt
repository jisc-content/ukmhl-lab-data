11 NERVES OF THE AXILLA. Frequently two veins instead of one are present in the lower part of the axillary space. Through this vein nearly the whole of the blood of the limb below the shoulder is conveyed onwards; and interruption to its current will occasion congestion in the parts to ■which its roots extend. A tolerably complete occlusion of this main circulating channel, as in the case of a slowly-growing tumour, will not only give rise to congestion, but will cause serous fluid to transude through the coats of the vessels into the surrounding textures. NERVES OF THE AXILLA. The nerves in this dissection are derived from two sources :— Those on the side of the chest are offsets of the intercostal nerves, and appear between the digitations of the serratus magnus muscle; and those lying around or near the axillary vessels belong to the ^— • brachial plexus. Latekal Cutaneous of the Thorax. Lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve (the highest of the set). Offset of third intercostal. Offset of fourth intercostal. Offset of fifth intercostal. Offset of sixth intercostal. Anterior branch of the offset of .the second intercostal. * * Anterior branches of the offsets of the other intercostal nerves. .

The median^ 22, is the companion nerve to the axillary artery, and is placed on the outer side. The ulnar nerve, 21, smaller than the median, but without branch like it, lies to the inner side of the arterial trunk.

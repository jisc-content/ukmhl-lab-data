The group of shoulder muscles is strained by the weight of the arm, as in Plate vi. Naturally the teres minor muscle, K, is not so covered by the long head of the triceps ; but as this head was cut, and the limb hanging, its upper end, B, was pushed back by the latissimus dorsi arching in front. The latissimus dorsi, M, and teres major, N, are stretched as they descend to the humerus. Only the upper edge of the teres appears ; below and in front they are partly blended by tendinous fibres. By the weight of the limb the deltoid muscle, P, is made to look flatter than it is usually. VESSELS OF THE BACK OF THE ARM. The ramifications of the superior profunda artery through the triceps, and its origin from the brachial trunk, are contained in this region. Some small branches of the circumflex artery appear behind the border of the deltoid. a. Brachial artery. h. Basilic vein becoming axillary. c. Superior profunda artery. d. Offset of the profunda to the front of the arm, with the musculo-spiral nerve. /. Branch of artery along the outer intermuscular septum. g. Inosculating artery from the re- current radial. h. Anastomotic branch from the ? V ' interosseous recurrent artery. k. Muscular branch of the artery to the triceps and anconeus. I. Branch of artery to the teres minor from the posterior circumflex. m. and n. Cutaneous and muscular off'sets of the posterior cir- cumflex artery. Brachial artery, a.â€”The anatomy of the brachial trunk issuing from the armpit has been described with Plate vi. p. 61. The following large muscular ofiPset springs from this part of the artery.

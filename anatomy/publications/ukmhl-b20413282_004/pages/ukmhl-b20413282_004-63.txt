DESCRIPTION OF PLATE YI. The triceps muscle at the back of the arm and some of the shoulder muscles are here displayed. Whilst the Drawing was in progress the body was raised on blocks, and the arm was fastened over the side of the table. To lay bare the triceps carry an incision along the back of the arm, and reflect the integuments and the deep fascia beyond the elbow. Generally the limb has been separated from the trunk before the student undertakes the dissection; in such case the triceps muscle may be made tense by a block beneath the elbow. MUSCLES OF THE ARM AND SHOULDER. On the back of the humerus lies the large triceps muscle, which extends the elbow-joint. The shoulder muscles have been described with Plate v., and will require but little additional notice; the scapular muscles are more stretched in this than in the preceding Plate. A. Rhomboideus major. B. Latissimus dorsi. C. Teres major. D. Teres minor. E. Infra-spinatus. F. Deltoid muscle. G. Inner head of the triceps. H. Middle head of the triceps. K. Outer head of the triceps. L. Tendon of the triceps. ]S[. Fascia over the infra-spinatus. 0. Fascia of the arm. P. Spine of the scapula. The triceps extensor ciibiti is undivided below, but is split into three processes of origin above, viz., the outer, inner, and middle heads. The outer head, K, is attached along the upper half of the posterior surface of the humerus, above the groove for the musculo-spiral nerve and its vessels, and reaches upwards nearly to the teres minor (Theile).* This attachment is repre- sented in Plate vii. * See a foot-note to the description of the triceps belonging to Plate VIL

51 NERVES OF THE ARM. The trunk of the musculo-spiral nerve, lying beneath the brachial artery, furnishes a cutaneous branch, 1, to the integu- ments of the back of the arm ; this reaches as far as the lower third, or sometimes nearly to the elbow. A muscular branch, 2? to the inner head, K, and the middle head, M, of the triceps. ^ ^^^^J^^/^^/. arises in common with the preceding. ^W^<^^^^«t^^ 2e^^yzJTZ^Z712^ The nerve of Wrislerg, 3, and the large internal cutaneous, 4, ?c£a^ )^ A pierce the fascia of the arm rather below the middle, and are dis- ^ sAj^^ ^t^^^^- tributed to the integuments of the back of the arm and forearm : their position internal to the brachial artery may be noticed. Usually the cutaneous nerve, 4, lies over the upper part of the artery. Its place at the elbow under the median basilic vein is regular: for another arrangement, see Plate iii. The median nerve, 7, takes the same course in the arm as the brachial artery, and lies close to that vessel (p. 46). Outside the artery above, and inside below, it crosses over the blood vessel so as to be found on the inner side about two inches above the elbow. Sometimes the nerve passes under instead of over the artery in its change of position from the one side to the other. No branch is distributed from it in the upper arm. Being the companion nerve to the main artery, it changes generally its place when the vessel deviates from the usual site. Thus in those instances in which the brachial artery courses along the inner intermuscular septum to the elbow the nerve usually accompanies it; but the nerve may be near the septum without the blood vessel (p. 38). In this last case a wound just above the elbow might cut through the nerve, and interfere with the actions of the parts supplied by it; or from the close con- tiguity of the ulnar and median nerves, one being before and the other behind the intermuscular septum, C, the same wound dividing both trunks would cause loss of power in the muscles on the front of the limb below the elbow, with insensibility in the fingers and the palm of the hand, and in part in the back of the hand. The ulnar nerve passes through the upper arm without branching, and enters the forearm behind the elbow-joint. As far as the middle of the arm the nerve is close to, and rather E 2

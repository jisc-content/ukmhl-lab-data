SPECIAL MUSCLES OF THE HAND. 93 the trunk of the ulnar nerve ; and the power of feeling would be lost at the same time on the back of the two inner fingers which are supplied by the same nerve. Besides the paralysis of the deep muscles attending injury of the nerve, which will be noticed in the description of Fig. ii., the small palmaris muscle, A, will lose its power of contracting. Most of the special muscles of the hand, and the deep palmar arch, with its companion nerve, are represented in the right-hand Figure of the Plate. This dissection follows the preceding ; and to carry it out, the superficial palmar arch and the ulnar and median nerves are to be cut through at the annular ligament, and are to be taken away: then the superficial and deep flexor tendons having been cut at the same spot, are to be thrown forwards to the digitsâ€”the lumbrical muscles attached to the deep tendons being cleaned as the superficial tendons are raised. All the muscles which have both origin and insertion in the hand will be now described, with the exception of the palmaris brevis. They consist of three sets : a thumb group, a little- finger group, and a central group for the other digits. Figure II. SPECIAL MUSCLES OF THE HAND. B. Abductor pollicis. C. Opponens pollicis, D.

The thumb muscles, four in number, consist of an abductor, an adductor, and a flexor, with a special muscle to oppose the thumb to the other digits.

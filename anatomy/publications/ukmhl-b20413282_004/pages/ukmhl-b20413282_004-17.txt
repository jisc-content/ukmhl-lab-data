LYMPHATICS OF THE AXILLA. 13 LATERAL CUTANEOUS NERVES OF THE THORAX, Five lateral cutaneous Iranclies of the intercostal trunks were laid bare in the dissection; they appear lax after they have been separated from the surrounding fat. The branches directed for- wards over the pectoralis were necessarily detached from the skin, and were then laid on the surface of the muscle. As the first intercostal trunk does not furnish commonly any lateral cutaneous branch, the nerves shown are derived from the five next intercostal trunks. Each branch divides into two parts (anterior and posterior) as it issues between the ribs, and these terminate on the lateral part of the thorax. The anterior offsets, 6, * * *, end in the integuments covering the pectoralis major; and the posterior, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, somewhat larger in size, ramify in the skin of the arm, and in that over the latissimus dorsi. In this body the third nerve wanted an anterior offset. The highest and largest of the lateral cutaneous nerves,â€”that from the second intercostal trunk, differs in some respects from the others. Its anterior branch, 6 (laid on the pectoralis, and not always present), supplies the arm-pit as well as the teguments on the pectoralis major: its posterior branch, 1, called intercosto- humeral, reaches the integuments of the back of the arm, and gives a communicating offset, 7, to the nerve of Wrisberg. Only a few of the glands of the axilla were retained in the dissection, and these have fallen, necessarily, from their natural position after the removal of the fat in which they are imbedded. About ten or twelve in number, the glands vary much in their shape and size. They have the following general linear arrange- ment in sets.

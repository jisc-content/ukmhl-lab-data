DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE FOREARM. 110 anastomose together as well as with the ending of the anterior interosseous, /. Recurrent artery, of the radial, ascends beneath the supinator longus, M, and communicates with the upper profunda in the arm. (Plate vii.) It supplies the supinator, and the radial extensors of the wrist, also the brachialis anticus ; and a con- siderable offset enters the supinator brevis, A, and communicates with the recurrent interosseous. Radial artery, h. The anatomy of the trunk and branches of this artery on the back of the wrist and hand has been given in the description of Plate xi., to which reference may be made. NERVE OF THE BACK OF THE FOREARM. The musculo-spiral nerve supplies the extensor and supinator muscles of the back of the forearm. 1. Musculo-spiral trunk. 2. Radial nerve. 3. Posterior interosseous. 4. Branch to the two first extensors of the thumb. 5. Branch to the third extensor of the thumb and the indicator muscle. 6. Continuation of the posterior interosseous nerve. 7. Gangliform enlargement of the nerve on the wrist. The trunk of the musculo-spiral nerve, 1, has been traced through the triceps to the outer part of the arm. (Plate vii.) Guided afterwards by the long supinator, M, and resting on the brachialis, N, it reaches the outer condyle of the humerus, and divides into two—radial aud posterior interosseous. Branches from it enter the two muscles mentioned, also the long extensor of the wrist, and sometimes the short extensor. The radial nerve, 2, has solely a cutaneous distribution, and ends in the integuments of the back of the hand, and the three outer digits. The posterior interosseous nerve, 3, pierces the supinator brevis, and runs between the two strata of muscles to the middle of the forearm. Then jinkirig^,jijad£t.. the extensor of the second phalanx of the thumb, it is continued on the interosseous mem-

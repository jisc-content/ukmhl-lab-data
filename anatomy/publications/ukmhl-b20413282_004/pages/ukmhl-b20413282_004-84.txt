80 DISSECTION OF THE FEONT OF THE FOREARM. weight of the hand is taken off by fixing the forearm and hand with splints in a position midway between pronation and supina- i tion, so that the thumb shall be in a line with the upper part of the radius, and the palm of the hand shall be turned to the chest. Should the lower fragment not be brought well into line with the upper by the position of the forearm above-said, it will be necessary to place the hand quite supine (the palm of the hand looking directly upwards), and to fix it with splints in that posture, as was recommended by Mr. Lonsdale.* In fracture of the shafts of hath bones of the forearm, the lower ends, as in fracture of the radius, depart from the line of the upper ends, being dragged away by the weight of the hand. They have further a tendency to approximate across the inter- osseous space, and will therefore be easily made to touch by any constriction, such as a bandage round the limb. By supinating the hand in the manner described for fracture of the radius, the lower displaced ends will be brought to the upper fixed parts of the bones. And with the view of keeping apart the bones, gentle pressure with a narrow graduated pad is some- times employed along the front and back of tlie forearm in a line with the interval between them. Pressure by means of a bandage is not to be made on the member, lest the broken ends be brought together, and the movements of the radius be lost by this bone blending with the ulna in the process of union. Redisplacement of the apposited ends may be prevented by splints reaching from the elbow to the fingers. ARTERIES OF THE FOREARM, Both radial and ulnar arteries are laid bare in the dissection, but the anatomy only of the ulnar and its branches will be now given. For a short distance above the elbow-joint the brachial trunk is shown. * ''Fractureof tlie Forearm." By Edward Lonsdale. Medical Gazette, 1832, p. 910.

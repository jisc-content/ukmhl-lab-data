DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE FOREARM. 106 carpal boneâ€”one on each side, to the last phalanx: the inner one of these is marked d ; and the outer one springs from the radial trunk, about half an inch higher up. There is one branch for the fore finger, which is continued on the radial side of that digit, and supplies the integuments ; in this body it is conjoined with the inner artery to the dorsum of the thumb. Both the posterior interosseous artery, and the anterior interosseous, ^, appear near the wrist ; but they belong to the deeper dissection, with which they will be described. DESCEIPTION OF PLATE XII. The deep muscles of the back of the forearm and the posterior interosseous artery and nerve are pictured in this Plate. The superficial muscles have been cut through near their origin, with the exception of the supinator longus on the one side, and the anconeus on the other. In reflecting the extensors of the fingers, the branches of vessels and nerves to them should be defined at the same time. DEEP MUSCLES. In the group of deep muscles at the back of the forearm are included three extensors of the thumb, the special extensor of the fore finger, and the short supinator. A. Supinator brevis. B. Extensor ossis metacarpi pol- licis. C. Extensor prinii internodii pol- licis. D. Extensor secundi internodii pollicis. E. Extensor proprius indicis. F. Extensor longus digitorum, cut. G. Extensor carpi ulnaris. H. Anconeus muscle. K. Extensor carpi radialis brevior, L. Extensor carpi radialis longior. M. Supinator longus. N. Brachialis anticus. P. Biceps brachii muscle. R. Triceps bracliii muscle. S. Posterior annular ligament, t External lateral ligament of the elbow-joint.

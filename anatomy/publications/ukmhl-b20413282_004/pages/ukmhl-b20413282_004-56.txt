52 DISSECTION OF THE ARM. behind the brachial artery ; but it separates afterwards from the vessel, passing through the intermuscular septum, and is con- tinued behind this piece of foscia to the hollow between the olecranon and the inner condyle of the humerus. Pressure applied to it behind the elbow-joint causes a peculiar tingling along the inner side of the hand, and in the inner two fingers. LYMPHATICS OF THE ARM. Superficial lymphatics accompany the superficial veins in the arm ; and the greater number lie along the inner part of the limb. Above the elbow are some superficial lymphatic glands in front of the intermuscular septum, which are marked thus, f t t ? these are the lowest superficial glands in the limb. Three glands were present in the dissection. Enlargement of those glands may be brought on by causes which induce inflammation and swelling of lymphatic glands elsewhere ; and a small tumour in this part of the arm may be owing to an increase of one of the glands. Deep lymphatics with their appertaining glands course with the trunks of the blood vessels beneath the fascia, and enter tlie glands in the axilla. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE Y. This view exhibits the dissection of the shoulder, and that of the superficial muscles and vessels of the back of the scapula. On the detached limb this dissection will follow the exami- nation of the subscapularis muscle on the under surface of the scapula; and it is readily made by reflecting the integuments and the deep fascia from before backwards towards the lower angle of the blade-bone. By cutting through the deltoid near its upper attachment, the vessels and nerve beneath it can be traced out.

75 DISSECTIO>^ OF THE FRO^'T OF THE FOREARM. sented, appears smaller thaa it is commonly, in consequence of being partly covered by the venae comites. The course and the branches of the artery are shown in Plate ix. ITERTES OF THE FOREARM. Three nerves, viz., median, ulnar, and radial, are visible each for a short distance in this dissection of the superficial muscles of the forearm. 1. Cutaneo-as part of tlie mtis- culo-cutaneous, named ex- ternal cutaneous of the fore- arm. 2, 2. Median nerve. 3. RarJial nerve. 4. Cutaneous palmar branch of the median nerve. 5. Palmar part of the ulnar nerve. The median nerve, 2, is superficial for two inches above the wrist, and is placed on the outer side of the tendons of the flexor snblimis. As it passes through the forearm it lies beneath the superficial flexors. From the forearm it is continued to the hand beneath the annular ligament. The following offset arises from this part of the nerve. The cutaneous palmar Iranch, 4, pierces the deep fascia near the ^vrist, and crosses over the annular ligament to end in the integu- ments of the ball of the thumb and palm of the hand; at its ending it communicates with the ulnar nerve. The radial nerve, 3, is a tegumentary branch of the musculo- spiral (Plate xii. 2), and ends on the back of the hand. Becomin superficial behind the tendon of the supinator longus, it terminates in the tegnments of the back of the thumb, of the next two digits, and sometimes of half the ring finger. The ulnar nerve, 5, enters the palm of the hand over the annular ligament; its termination is given in Plate x. This is the only part of the nerve which comes into sight in the forearm before the flexor carpi ulnaris has been turned aside ; and it is partly concealed by the ulnar vessels.

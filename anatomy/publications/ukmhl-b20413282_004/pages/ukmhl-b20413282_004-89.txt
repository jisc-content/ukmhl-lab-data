DESCRIPTION OF PLATE X. Views of the two dissections of the palm of the hand, which are needed to lay bare the superficial and deep muscles, vessels, and nerves. Figure I. In the left-hand Figure the superficial palmar arch of the ulnar artery, with its offsets, also the nerves to the digits, and the tendons of the flexor muscles, are delineated. In making the dissection the integuments and the deep palmar fascia are first to be removed. The former may be raised by a cut along the centre of the palm, terminated by cross cuts at the wrist and the roots of the fingers; and as the inner fiap is raised, the palmaris brevis muscle will be met with in the fat. After the palmar fascia has been denuded, and its arrangement at the fingers examined, it may be cut behind, where it joins the tendon of the palmaris longus, E, and may be thrown forwards. By taking away the teguments of one finger, say the middle, the sheaths of the flexor tendons will come into view; and after the removal of the sheath, the arrangement of the tendons will be manifest, as in the ring finger. CENTRAL MUSCLES OF THE PALM. In the hollow of the hand lie the flexor tendons, with some other muscles. Laterally the muscles of the thumb and little finger form on each side a ball or prominence, to be noticed afterwards; and the group on the inner side is partly covered by the small sub- cutaneous palmar muscle.

98 DISSECTION OF THE HAND. Wounds of the deep arch are rare, in consequence of its deeper and securer position in the hand; and ligature of the vessel would be oftentimes impossible. Supposing the wounded vessel cannot be reached, the bleeding would most commonly be arrested by a graduated compress to the wound, and by pressure on the radial and ulnar arteries in the lower third of the foreaim. If those means fail to stop the bursting forth of the blood, ligature of the radial artery—the chief vessel entering the arch— would probably be effectual in commanding the haemorrhage. Should bleeding still occur, and possibly from large communi- cating branches with the ulnar artery, for no large unusual artery joins the deep arch, tying the ulnar trunk might be tried. As a last resource ligature of the brachial artery remains. DEEP NERVE OF THE PALM. The ulnar nerve is distributed to those muscles of the inner and deep parts of the palm of the hand, which do not receive branches from the median nerve. 1, 1. Branches to muscles. the lumbrical 2. Deep palmar branch of the ulnar nerv^e. 3. Trunk of the ulnar nerve. The deep palmar hranch, 2, of the ulnar nerve, arising near the wrist, passes deeply between the flexor brevis and abductor minimi digiti, or through the adductor muscle, L, as in the Figure, and accompanies the radial arch to the first interosseous space, where it ends by supplying the adductor pollicis, H, and the inner head, F, of the flexor brevis pollicis. Muscular offsets are furnished to the muscles of the little finger, viz., adductor, J, flexor brevis, K, and adductor, L; to all the seven interossei muscles; and to the inner two lumbricales. All the muscles of the hand, except two and a half of the thumb and the two outer lumbricales, receive branches from the deep part of the ulnar nerve. Destruction of the trunk of the ulnar nerve in the arm would affect the movements of the thumb

MUSCLES OF THE SCAPULA AND SHOULDER. 53 MUSCLES OF THE SCAPULA, SHOULDER, AND ARM. Three groups of muscles are laid bare more or less completely in the dissection, viz., the muscles of two borders of the scapula; those of the posterior surface of that bone; and those of the shoulder and the back of the arm. All the muscles passing between the humerus and the scapula are relaxed, and are consequently wide and hanging ; but in Plate vi. the muscles are shown on the stretch, where the difference in their form and position may be noted. The dorsal muscles of the scapula cover the shoulder-joint, and will receive injury in dislocation of the head of the humerus. A. Rhomboideus major. B. Rhomboideus minor. C. Levator anguli scapula. D. Teres major. E. Latissimus dorsi, F. Long head of the triceps. G. Outer head of the triceps. H. Supra-spinatxis. K. Infra-spinatus. L. Teres minor. N. Deltoid muscle. 0. Fascia on the dorsal sca]jular muscles. The three muscles marked A, B, C, arise from the spinal column, and are fixed into the base of the scapula. The rhomboideus major, A, is inserted between the spine and the lower angle of the bone. The rhomhoideus minor, B, is attached opposite the smooth sur- face at the root of the spine. The levator anguU scapulae, C, is fixed above the last, reaching from it to the upper angle of the shoulder-blade. From the direction of their fibres the muscles, when acting without the trapezius, would lower the point of the shoulder, by raising and bringing towards the spinal column the lower angle and base of the scapula. Connected with the inferior border of the scapula are the teres major and the long head of the triceps; and the latissimus dorsi crosses the others, resting on the inferior angle of the bone. The teres major, D, arises from a special impression on the lower angle of the scapula, from the deep fascia covering the dorsal

6 DISSECTION OF THE UlTER LIMB. ARTERIES OF THE AXILLA. The lower end of the axillary artery with its branches are now brought under notice ; but only a small narrow strip of the arterial trunk can be seen in the Figure in consequence of its connections with veins and nerves being preserved. This part of the vessel is uncovered by muscle, and is in contact with the common investing parts of the limb. A superficial wound of the limb may lay it open. It supplies branches to the chest and the shoulder. a. Axillary artery. h. Long thoracic. d. Alar thoracic. e. External mammary. /. Subscapular. ^. Dorsal scapular. h. Posterior circumflex. n. Cutaneous artery with the in- ternal cutaneous of the nius- culo-spiral nerve. 0, Artery to the long head of the triceps muscle. The axillary or main artery of the upper limb crosses the space from the chest to the ann beneath the pectoral muscles, but only the part between the lower border of the pectoralis major, A, and the lower border of the teres major, D, is delineated. Its position is marked by the swell of the coraco-brachialis muscle, K; and its depth from the surface is very slight, only the tegumentary coverings of the limb concealing it, so that it can be readily reached in an operation, or it can be compressed with ease against the humerus. Its connections with the muscles around are the following :— Behind are the subscapularis, H, the latissimus, C, and teres major, D ; and on the outer side is the coraco-brachialis, K. Its companion vein (axillary) is placed on the inner or chest ^ide, partly concealing the artery, and has to be drawn aside in attempts to tie the arterial trunk. Large nervous cords lie around the artery :—outside is the median nerve, 22 ; inside the ulnar, 21, and the nerve of Wris- berg, 11 (which is sometimes nearer the artery). Superficial to the vessel is the large internal cutaneous, 18 ; and deeper than it or beneath, is the musculo-spiral, 13 (which is drawn somewhat

5 BOUNDS OF THE AXILLA. neck, and lies between the chest and the scapular arch. It cannot be recognised in this Figure, but it may be observed more com- pletely in Plate ii. The state of the muscular boundaries of the axilla is much altered by the position of the limb ; for the tenseness is dimi- nished when the arm is adducted, and increased when the arm is abducted from the thorax. And the depth will vary, in like manner, with change in the position of the limb. These facts may be remembered with advantage in any endeavour to estimate the size of a tumour in the axilla. In consequence of the position of this intermuscular space at the inner side of the shoulder bone, and of the loose nature of the fatty tissue contained in it, the movements of the scapula over the chest are facilitated. And from its situation on that side of the shoulder joint to which flexion is made, the large vessels and nerves of the limb are transmitted through it beyond the joint without injury from stretching in the motions of that articulation. A corresponding hollow exists in the lower limb in front of the hip-joint. In the undissected limb the student may recognise by the eye and the touch the prominence of the cords of the large axillary nerves and vessels along the side of the arm ; and if the arm is raised and freely moved by one hand, whilst the two fore fingers of the other are pressed into the arm-pit; the moving head of the humerus may be felt through the skin and fascia. During life the hollow is useful to the surgeon in his attempts to discover the nature and size of an enlargement, such as an aneurism, in this situation, or the position of the dislocated head of the humerus. But the size of the space interferes with the detection of small tumours, like an enlarged gland ; for these may extend upwards and inwards towards the chest in the loose fat, and acquire considerable size before their presence will be indicated by any external swelling.

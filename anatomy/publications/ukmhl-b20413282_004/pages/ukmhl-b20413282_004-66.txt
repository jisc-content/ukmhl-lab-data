DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE ARM. 62 A large companion vein (the continuation of the basilic) is placed on the inner side. Close inside the artery is the ulnar nerve, 3; and intervening between it and the middle head of the triceps is the musculo- spiral nerve, 4. Two muscular offsets, d and /, enter the long head of the triceps. The upper profunda, or the muscular artery of the back of the arm, is concealed by the middle head of the triceps; an offset, c, from it enters the outer head of that muscle. The distribution of this branch is represented in Plate vii. Inferior profunda artery, g.—Winding backwards from the brachial (Plate iv.), it accompanies the ulnar nerve, 3, to the interval between the olecranon and the inner condyle, where it joins a branch of the ulnar artery. The dorsal scapular artery, a, courses under the teres minor muscle, p. 58. Amongst the surrounding muscles supplied by it is the deltoid, to which it gives an offset: this was cut through in the dissection. The position of the posterior circumflex artery, b, to the deltoid appears in this view of the parts. Some of its muscular offsets, and the branch to the integuments, are apparent. NERVES OF THE SHOULDER AND ARM. The nerves of the shoulder and back of the arm are branches of the brachial plexus, and have been partly represented in other Illustrations. 1. Circumflex nerve. 2.

Its cutaneous offset retains its natural place in this dissection. The musculo-spiral nerve, 4, winds from the inner to the outer side of the limb between the Immerus and the triceps muscle

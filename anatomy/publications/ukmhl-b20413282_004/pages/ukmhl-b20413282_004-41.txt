BRACHIAL ARTERY AT THE ELBOW. 37 Several other diseased states produced by venesection, with their treatment, were described by Abernethy ; and the student who is desirous of obtaining further information may look to the essays of that surgeon.* The student should observe scrupulously the injunctionâ€”never to bleed with a lancet that has been used for other purposes. BRACHIAL ARTERY AT THE ELBOW. The lower end of the brachial artery, I, which lies under the superficial veins, and may be wounded in venesection, has been laid bare by reflecting a piece, C, of the deep fascia. In this situation the artery is very near the surface of the limb, and is covered only by the integuments and the deep fascia, B. Along its outer side is the biceps muscle. A, which will serve as the guide to the vessel. Underneath it lies the brachialis anticus muscle (Plate iv., F). One large accompanying nerve, median, 8, is placed on the inner side of the artery, and the median basilic vein crosses over it. Only superficial offsets are furnished to the integuments from this part of the vessel. Ligature of the artery at the elbow may be necessary in conse- quence of a wound with a lancet in venesection, or with any other cutting instrument. In the case of a wound from accident the vessel requires to be secured by one thread above and another below the injury ; and with the surrounding textures infiltrated with blood, the surgeon may experience some difficulty in finding the ends of the vessel, unless he has studied the connections, and practised previously the operation of applying a ligature to the artery in the dead body. In an operation here for aneurism after a wound, as when the vessel is punctured in venesection, the tumour is to be opened, and the contents of the sac being removed, the arterial trunk is to be tied above and below the opening in it. * Surgical Observations on Injuries of the Head and on Miscellaneous Subjects, by John Abernethy, F.R.S. ; 4th Edit. p. 135 : London, 1825,

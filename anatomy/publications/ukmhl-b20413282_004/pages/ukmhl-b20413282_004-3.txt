ILLUSTRATIONS OF DISSECTIONS. DESCEIPTION OF THE PLATES. DESCRIPTION or PLATE I. The superficial muscles of the thorax, and the axilla with its contents, are delineated in this Plate. The natural size of the dissected part has been slightly reduced in the Drawing for the purpose of showing the whole of the upper limb. â€¢In the preparation of the dissection the limb was drawn away from the trunk to render tense the muscles. Next, the integu- ments were divided, and the skin and fat were raised together in one large flap from the front of the thorax and the axilla by carrying the scalpel upwards and outwards from the chest to the arm, as the fibres of the muscle run, and along one muscular fasciculus at a time. Afterwards the fat was cleared out of the axilla; and the muscles bounding the space behind were laid bare in the same way as those limiting it in front. MUSCLES OF THE THORAX AND ARM. Two sets of muscles are displayed in the dissection ; one bounding the arm-pit before and behind; and the other lying in front, and at the back of the humerus. The former group are directed from the trunk to the limb, and move the limb forwards and backwards over the chest. Where they are fixed to the thorax they are separated widely by the ribs, but B

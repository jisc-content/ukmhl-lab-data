DISSECTION OF THE SHOULDER. 58 artery when ifc is divided, but he cannot compress at the same time the circumflex artery placed much farther back. This vessel pours out blood freely, and it may be secured first, provided the assistant controls the bleeding of the axillary trunk. The dorsal scapular artery, b, is an offset of the subscapular branch of the axillary (Plate ii./). Appearing through the tri- angular space behind the long head of the triceps, it bends round the edge of the scapula under the teres minor, and ramifies in the infra-spinal fossa. As it is about to enter the fossa a branch is directed along the inferior border of the scapula, between the teres muscles, to which and the integuments it is distributed. NERVE OF THE SHOULDER. A large nerve from the brachial plexus ramifies under the deltoid muscle. The circumflex nerve, 1, which is delineated in Plate i. 12, ac- companies the posterior circumflex artery to the shoulder. Like the vessel it ends mostly in the deltoid muscle, supplying ofiFsets to the fleshy fibres as it winds over the humerus. Close to the border of the teres minor a considerable branch, 2, breaks up into oflPsets to the teres, the back of the deltoid, and the integuments covering the lower part of the deltoid muscle. In the natural position of the integuments the cutaneous branch would wind forwards over the muscle. On the branch to the teres minor, 3, there is usually an en- largement of a reddish colour and elongated form, which has been designated a "gangliform swelling." Before the nerve is dis- turbed that swelling lies close to the teres muscle. In consequence of the loop made by the circumflex nerve under the head of the humerus, compression of it with impairment of function follows dislocation downwards of that bone. Paralysis of the deltoid muscle, with inability to raise the arm, will follow considerable disease or injury of the circumflex nerve.

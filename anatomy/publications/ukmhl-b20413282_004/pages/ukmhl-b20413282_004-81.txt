DESCEIPTION OF PLATE IX. This Plate represents the dissection of the deep muscles on the front of the forearm, with the vessels and nerves in contact with them. To make ready the dissection cut through near the humerus and remove the inner group of the superficial muscles, seen in Plate viii., except the pronator teres on the outside, and the flexor carpi ulnaris on the inside ; then draw upwards the pronator, and inwards slightly the flexor ulnaris from the ulnar vessels. The small veins with the branches of the arteries have been taken away. DEEP MUSCLES OF THE FOREAEM. The deep muscles are three in number: two flex the digits, and one pronates the radius. One, a flexor of the thumb, lies on the radius ; and the other large muscle, covering the ulna, is the common flexor of the fingers. The pronator is placed beneath the other two near the wrist. A. Lower end of the biceps. B. Brachialis anticus. C. Supinator longus. D. Pronator teres. F. Conjoined palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis, cut, and turned aside. G. Flexor carpi ulnaris. H. Supinator brevis. J. Cut end of the flexor sublimis. K. Flexor longus pollicis. L. Flexor profundus digitomm. iN". Slip of flexor longus pollicis. 0. Extensor ossis metacarpi pol- licis. P. Pronator quadratus muscle. Q. Tendons of flexor sublimis, cut. E. Tendon of flexor carpi radialis. X. Anterior annular ligament, t Internal intermuscular septum of the arm. The flexor longus pollicis, K, arises from the upper three fourths of the anterior surface of the shaft of the radius ; from the con-

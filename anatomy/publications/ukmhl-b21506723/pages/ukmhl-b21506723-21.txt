INTRODUCTION. TiiEBK are. as there always have been, certain thinkers and workers in the world, who have studies and pursuits, wliich incline them to the investigation of the Efiind, and others whose bent and calling lead them, on the other hand, to the observation of tlie body, of man. The Metaphys^ician and the Moral Philosopher, the Logician and the Philologist, the Sociologist and the Jurist, the Dogmatist and the Theologian, the Historian, and to a large extent the Poet, all of whom have their atten- tion chiefly directed to the gifts and acquirements, the tlioughts, sayings, doings and aspirations of Humanity, are necessarily prone to dissociate man from animals, rather than to associate him with them.

With this latter view, the Anthropologist entirely coincides ; and, further- more, aided by the Anatomist, Physiologist and Psychologist, he compares man with animals, and endeavours to estimate justly the distance which intervenes between liim and the highest of them, to determine with accuracy their points of resemblance and of difference, and thus to ascertain the true nature of their association, alliance, and affinity. The sculptor and the painter may yield or refuse their adhesion to any particular Biological speculations; but, within the bounds of their respective arts, so far as these are imitative or representative, they must of necessity regard man as a being, having a distinctive animal form, subject to number- less individual variations, according to diff"erences of sex, age, character, and race. Feebly comprehending, it may be, but strongly sympathising with the moral and intellectual nature of his fellow men, with their emotions and *

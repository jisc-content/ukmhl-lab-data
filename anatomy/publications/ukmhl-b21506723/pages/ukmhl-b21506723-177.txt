THE BONES OF THE CRANIUM. 157 surface, named the glabella, g. The lower edges of the internal angular pro- cesses are connected with the lacrymal bones, fig. 62, L, and with the upper jaw bones, J. The intermediate indented part below the glabella, sometimes named the nasal notch, supports the two small nasal bones N, the deep-seated nasal spine also serving to sustain them. On each side of the glabella, is the nasal eminence, passing from which, upwards and outwards, a little above the inner half of the supra-orbital arch, and separated from it by a slight flattening of the bone, is an oblique, slightly curved, smooth ridge, larger and more Fig. 63.â€”The front view of the Skull. References the same as in Fig. 62. prominent internally, and subsiding gradually as it passes outwards, known as the superciliary erainence, figs. 62, 63, c. These nasal and superciliary eminences of the two sides, correspond with large subjacent cavities situated in the substance of the bone, named the frontal cells or sinuses. These sinuses, one in each half of the bone, are of considerable interest; they are formed by the separation of the outer and inner tables of the frontal bone, and by the substitution of spaces containing air, in place of the diploe, the cavities thus formed communicating with corresponding sinuses in the ethmoid bone, and these again with the interior of the nose, so that air can pass, from without, into the whole series of sinuses. They are lined by a mucous membrane, which is continuous with that of the nasal cavities. One use of these sinuses, is to perfect the resonance of the

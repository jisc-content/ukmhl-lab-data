THE SKULL CONSIDERED AS A WHOLE. 175 the eyelids and the skin, so that it very precisely determines the external form, which, indeed, is very pronounced in this situation, immediately in front of the temple. The temple itself is either slightly convex from the action of a large temporal muscle, or sunk in when this muscle is very thin. The bony framework of the face is in complete contrast with that of the cranium, being irregularly angular in its general contour, and very uneven on its surface. Seen from beloiv, the outline is bluntly triangular, the base of the triangle being turned backwards, and formed by a transverse line drawn through the condyles of the lower jaw, behind the angles of that bone, the blunted apex being directed forwards, and corresponding with the under surface of the symphysis menti. Viewed on its lateral aspect, the profile of the face also forms a triangle, having its hinder angle truncated along a line corresponding with the posterior border of the ramus of the lower jaw ; its vipper defective side, extending from the root of the nose to the condyle of the lower jaw, is attached beneath the slanting base of the cranium ; its under defective side reaches from the angle of the jaw to the chin ; its remaining anterior side is determined by a line drawn from the chin to the root of the nose. Regarded in front, the outline of the face is included in a hexagonal figure, having unequal sides ; a long horizontal upper side, corresponding with the cranio-facial junction, is formed by a line drawn transversely through the root of the nose, and the lower edges of the external and internal angular processes of the frontal bone; two very short sides descend, each ob- liquely outwards and downwards, from the external angular process of the frontal bone to the most prominent part of the zygoma, just behind and below the malar eminence; two much longer sides are bounded by lines running downwards and inwards, from the zygomatic arches to the two angles of the lower jaw; lastly, a horizontal under side is formed by a line, longer than the two last, but shorter than the upper horizontal line, beneath the lower jaw. This, imder side is somewhat indented in the middle, and truncated at its two ends. The greatest breadth of the facial hexagon, is opposite a horizontal line passing through the hinder part of the face, at the most prominent points of .the zygomatic arches, just behind and below the malar eminences, which line, accordingly, corresponds with the longest transverse diameter, or greatest width of the face; this is, invariably,-in excess of the vertical diameter, drawn in the median plane, from the root of the nose to the point of the chin. In the profile view of the cranial and facial bones together, it will be noticed that the plane of the foramen magnum, corresponds, more or less closely, with a line passing along the floor of the nasal fossse, but, according to the position of the head, this will necessarily vary. The parts on which the head is actually balanced, are the occipital condyles, and the position of these may be determined, almost exactly, by remembering that they are placed, when the head is in a state of equilibrium,

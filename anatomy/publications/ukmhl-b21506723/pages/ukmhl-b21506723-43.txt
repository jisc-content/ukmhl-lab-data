23 THE SKELETON. Table op the Bones. The following table constitutes a reference to the key-figures, 1 to 5, and ■will help the memory, as regards the names of the bones, and their position in the skeleton; it also gives the number of the bones in each great sub- division of the body, as well as the total number in the whole skeleton. The shoulder-girdle and hip-girdle are here placed in conjunction with their respec- tive extremities. The two patellae are not enumerated as bones of the skeleton proper ; nor are certain little ossicles, six in number, belonging to the ears, though these latter deserve to be so considered. The Head.

The skeleton obviously constitutes the hard basis of the Human Form. This hardness is due to the chemical composition of the bones, which consist of no less than about 66 per cent, of earthy matter, chiefly phosphate and

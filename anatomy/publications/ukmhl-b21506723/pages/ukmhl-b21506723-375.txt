355 SUEFACE FOEMS OF THE TEUNK. creases, traceable from the lumbar and lower dorsal spines, and crossing over the surface-forms of the erectores spinae muscles, on each side of that furrow ; these are not due to muscular intersections or inscriptions, such as sub-divide the recti muscles, to which, however, the fascia and skin are also comparatively- speaking very closely adherent, so that they show on the surface. Across the lower part of the abdomen, above the pubic prominence, is a crescentic depres- sion, which is gradually lost above the furrow formed by Poupart's ligament; the inner end of this furrow itself, disappears towards the pubes, and there is seen below it, a second oblique folding of the skin, which subsides outwards upon the thigh. Long and deep foldings of the integument appear, and disappear, across the loins and around the waist, according as the trunk is bent backwards or sideways, or is rotated, or brought straight or upright again. The axilla, closed in by a sort of floor, formed by the proper fascia, which keeps its borders in position, appears as a long triangular depression, between the chest and the arm, when the upper limb is raised, fig. 166, but merely as a narrow and shallow sulcus, when this is more or less dependent; the contrast between its shorter anterior and its longer posterior borders, has already been alluded to. Chiefly resting upon, but partially overlapping- the lower border of the pectoral plane on either side, is the mamma or mammary gland, rounded, conical, shorter and somewhat flatter above, but longer and more convex below, in the female bust, and projecting outwards and forwards, because the pectoral plane itself, on which it rests, slants backwards from the front of the chest towards the shoulder. These characters are scarcely recognisable in the male breast; but, to the outer side of and below it, there exists an accumu- lation of adipose tissue, which completely changes the form and direction of the neighbouring transverse subpectoral fold. The lower margin of the great pectoral muscle trends upwards obliquely to the armpit, whilst its inner end is rounded off", the result being a form in itself as meagre, and bounded by a line which in composition would be as weak, as that which would be produced by the slanting lower border of the gluteus maximus, above the back of the thigh; but the intervention of the rudimentary mammary gland and some accompanying subcutaneous fat, produces a bolder and a firmer form, more square in its outline below, and bounded by a pronounced fold, rectangular in relation to the vertical lines of the sternal furrow and the median depression of the linea alba. This rectangular subpectoral depression, as well as the horizontal linese transversse, and the vertically disposed linea alba and linese semilunares, imparting a certain breadth and grandeur to the male figure, were never lost sight of by the Greek and Grraeco-Eoman sculptors ; they are forms which would doubtless be developed in their models, in whom, youth, the exercises of the gymnasium, and a costume which never fettered the growth of the body, combined to realise the richest development of such local forms.

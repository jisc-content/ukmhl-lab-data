THE MUSCLES OF THE TEUNK. 345 raised. The great pectoral muscle draws the humerus forwards across the front of the chest, and rotates it inwards, in the latter action co-operating with the latissimus dorsi. Conjointly with this muscle, and with the teres major, the middle and lower portions of the pectoral bring the arm suddenly downwards from the elevated position, as in cutting, or chopping, with sword or axe ; but the upper or clavicular part distinctly helps in raising the arm, or in fixing it in a forward elevated position. In rowing and swimming, the two great pectorals bring the upper limbs forwards, whilst the latissimi dorsi muscles carry them backwards; all four muscles support the body on crutches, and sustain its weight in the act of climbing. In forced inspiration, the shoulders being raised, the pectorals are called into play. Fig. 163.—The Deltoid Muscle, from the back. Fig. 164.—The same, from the outer side. The Shoulder-cap Muscle, figs. 163 to 167.—This is the well-known deltoid muscle, which passes from the clavicle and scapula to the humerus, and joins on the arm to the trunk. Deltoideus, figs. 163, 164, 165, Superficial throughout, forming the prominent cap of the shoulder, and covering the deep-seated articular muscles, as well as the head and upper end of the humerus; thick, triangular, like an inverted Greek letter, delta, A, broad above, bent on itself horizontally, so as to cover the shoulder behind, on its outer aspect, and in front, and composed of numerous large fusiform, or conical, and more or less distinctly penniform, fleshy processes, arising from short tendinous bands, and ending on central

THE MUSCLES OF THE AEM. 359 middle of the arm, to form a full, fusiform, but slightly flattened mass, which terminates, sooner and somewhat abruptly on the tendon of insertion, on the outer border, but, later and more gradually, on the inner border of the tendon. The exceedingly beautiful and complicated forms of this muscle have been selected for special explanation, p. 262. As it is about to dip into the hollow at the bend of the elbow, its tendon gives off a strong fibrous expansion, the bicipital fascia, figs. 124, 166, which spreads out, obliquely downwards and inwards, over the fascia of the fore-arm below the elbow. As the biceps muscle passes over three joints, it can pro- duce motion in all. First, acting on the shoulder-joint, it raises, or abducts the humerus by its long head, and draws it forwards by its short head, which therefore aids in bringing the arm towards and in front of the trunk. Its long tendon supplements the ligaments of the shoulder, and enables the muscle to press the head of the humerus against the glenoid cavity, and so retain it in situ, especially in the dependent position ; the biceps, also, thus resists the escape of the humerus from the glenoid cavity, as, for ex- ample, when the deltoid muscle tends to draw that bone upwards; in these respects, this long tendon acts even more eflfectually than a ligament, as, by means of the mus- cular fasciculi connected with it, it can be adapted both to any change of position of the bone, and to every varying degree of force. Secondly, the biceps, acting on the elbow joint, is a powerful flexor of the fore-arm, balancing by its hold on the radius, the action of the brachialis anticus on the ulna ; it also draws upon the ulnar side of the fore-arm, through its bicipital fibrous expansion. Thirdly, the biceps passes beyond the superior radio-ulnar articulation; hence, as soon as the fore-arm is ever so slightly FiU. 169.â€”Superficial Anterior and other Muscles of the Arm.

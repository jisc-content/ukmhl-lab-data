226 THE JOINTS. branous laminae, pass obliquely between the bodies of the vertebrse, the fibres of each successive layer having an opposite direction, so that they cross each other and resist strains in all directions ; some of the fibres, however, pursue a less regular course. The central portion of each intervertebral substance, figs. 91, 92, forming less than half of its area, and placed nearer to the back of the disc, is composed of a pulpy, elastic, semi-translucent, pale yellowish substance, which, on a transverse section of the disc, rises up and assumes a conical or swollen form. This is more abundant in the lumbar and cervical, Fig. 91.—Vertical median section through the dorsi-lumbar region of the Spine, showing the intervertebral discs, the capsular ligaments, and the inter- and supra-spinous ligaments ; also a part of the spinal canal. Fig. 92.—Upper view of a Lumbar Vertebra, with transverse section of its intervertebral disc.

It consists of a very soft, (felicate fibro-cartilage ; near the bones, it merges into true cartilage. The bodies of the moveable vertebrae are further connected together by an arderior common ligament, fig. 93, which extends from the sacrum to the axis, whence it is prolonged upwards to the base of the skull; it gradually diminishes in breadth from below upwards, and is composed of deeper fibres attached to the intervertebral discs and the adjacent vertebrae, and of super- ficial fibres reaching over three or four vertebrae; a few lateral fibres also pass from bone to bone. Within the spinal canal, is a strong posterior common ligament, fig. 94, situated upon, and attached to the back of the bodies of the vertebrae, from the sacrum to the axis, whence it is prolonged to the occipital

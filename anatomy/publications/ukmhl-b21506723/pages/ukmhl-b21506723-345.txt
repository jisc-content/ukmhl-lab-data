325 THE MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. one side; and when the muscles of both sides contract, they balance the neck, and maintain it in lateral equipoise. The Longitudinal Dor- sal Group—figs. 150-152.— This includes the erector spina?, situated in the loins and back, and its prolongations into the neck, together with the complexus, and spinales muscles. They are very complicated in structure, and are held in position by the lumbar and vertebral fasciae, which will be described immedi- ately after them. They are very large and powerful muscles, which erect the trunk, and help to support the head upon the neck. Erector spince, fig. 150, Deep, beirig covered by a sheath formed by the lumbar fascia and vertebral aponeurosis, as well as by parts of other muscles of the back ; narrow and pointed below, over the sacrum, very large and prominent in the lumbar region, smaller and flattened in the back ; vertical or longitudinal, along the vertebro-costal grooves, between the spinous processes and theangies of the ribs, where these exist, else- where between the spinous and transverse processes. Before this muscle reaches the level of the lowest rib, it divides into two parts, an outer, smaller and shorter part, named the sacro-lumbalis, and an inner, larger and longer part, named the longissimus dor si, Both parts are tendinous on the Fig. 150.—The Longitudinal Dorsal Group, in the Back and Neck.

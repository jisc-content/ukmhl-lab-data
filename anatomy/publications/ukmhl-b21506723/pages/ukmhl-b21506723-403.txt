383 SUEFACE-FOKMS OF THE UPPER LIMB. of the wrist, which is the innermost muscle and tendon of this group. The largest intermuscular interval, here, is that between the two radial extensors and the common extensor of the fingers, which widens out below, as the muscles become tendinous, and from which emerges on the outer border of the lower part of the fore-arm, a remarkable, oblique, elongated eminence, partially subdivided, and passing downwards and outwards over the back and outer border of the radius, towards the root of the thumb, ending upon it in the form of a slight ridge. This eminence and ridge are produced by the extensor of the metacarpal bone and by that of the first phalanx of the thumb ; they interrupt, especially when the thumb is extended, in a very noticeable manner, the otherwise simple, and almost straight contour line of the lower part of the outer border of the fore-arm. The general mass of the supinator and extensor group, is subdivided into three subordinate forms; first, an outer, longitudinal, full form, descending from the arm, dependent on the long supinator and the two radial extensors, lifted up, as it were, by the sub- jacent external condyle of the humerus, the radius and the short supinator muscle; secondly, an intermediate emergent form, due to the extensor muscles of the thumb; and, thirdly, an inner longitudinal pointed form, produced by the common and special extensors of the fingers, and the ulnar extensor of the wrist. This last-named form tapers upwards, towards the external condyle, a short space in front of the subcutaneous part of the ulna, its posterior or inner border, describing a long sweeping curve, formed above by the intermuscular marking between it and the anconeus, and lower down by the ulnar furrow. The anconeus tnuscle itself produces a well-marked triangular, and slightly elevated plane, situated behind the upper part of this extensor mass, between it and the subcutaneous portion of the ulna, terminating above, at the back of the outer condyle of the humerus, which here sinks into the well-known dimple amongst the surrounding muscular forms. A slight intermuscular marking separates the ulnar extensor of the wrist from the extensors of the fingers. On the hack of the hand, the four tendons of the common extensor are so arranged, as to obviate any appearance of formality. They radiate from a point, not in the centre of the wrist, but nearer to its ulnar border; their lengths, their sizes, the angles at which they diverge, and the spaces between them, are all unequal. The strongest and straightest, but only the second as to length, is the tendon for the middle finger; the single tendon on its radial side, that for the index finger, is the longest, but not quite so thick ; it is, however, thicker, and more divergent than the one for the ring finger; the tendon for the little finger is the thinnest, shortest, and most divergent. The tendon of the special extensor of the little finger, can be traced coming down, separately, from near the lower end of the ulna; whilst that of the indicator muscle is in closer contact with, though really more independent of, the tendon

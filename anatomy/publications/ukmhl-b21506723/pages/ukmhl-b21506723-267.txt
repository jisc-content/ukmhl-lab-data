THE STRUCTURE AND ACTION OF THE MUSCLES. 247 larger ones being composed of smaller ones, and these again, when fully un- ravelled, of the smallest or ultimate fasciculi, fig. 118, a. All the fasciculi, small and large, are held together by a web of fine areolar connective tissue, known as the perimysium, in which the vessels and nerves of the muscle are supported. Each ultimate fasciculus (of which a small portion is shown at b), when examined under a magnifying lens, is seen to consist of a number of laterally compressed prismatic fibres, embedded in a finer perimysium, and measuring about 4:^th of an inch in diameter, and from 1 inch to 1|- inch in length; these are the muscular fibres. Each fibre, again, g, is composed of a soft substance, named sarcoc^e, [sarx, flesh), capable of almost unlimited longitu- dinal subdivision into numerous delicate threads, named the muscular /?6r;77cp, rraTWfST^iCTTSTm^T'^T"^l^l^i^i^'^!^i^i^'^'i^|'ii¥lH|B|P|l|§il|l|BjM|E[l!B|iiM|i,i|i|gill h Fi(J. 118. Microscopic structure of Muscle; «, portion of a small fasciculus, with six of its component ultimate fasciculi and the perimj^sium ; h, part of an ultimate fasciculus con- taining fifteen striped muscular fibres, cut across at one end, and free at ihe other, one being partially unravelled; c, parts of two muscular fibres, one ruptured, so as to show it; tubular sarcolemma; d, a single fibre passing into a bundle of fibrous connective tissues; c, ramified fibres ending in the mucous membrane of the tongue ; /, fibres terminating obliquely on the white fibrous tissue of a tendon ; g, part of a single fibre, more highly magnified and diagrammatic, showing its longitudinal subdivision into fibrills, and its transverse splitting into a disc, also the longitudinal lines and transverse striae, and lastly, the change of form and appearance due to contiaction ; h, a single fibrilla, still more highly magnified, showing its component sarcons cj'linders, with their dark centres, and clear surrounding material separated by a fine cross line. The dark centres correspond with the transverse stripe, and contain the bundles of longitudinal rods; i, bundles of nerve fibres running, in loops, across five ultimate fasciculi of a flat muscle ; ultimate ending of a single nerve fibre, upon and within the sarcolemma of a muscular fibre. which are enclosed in a transparent, homogeneous, tubular sheath, named llie sarcolemma, best seen when the soft contractile contents are broken across, c. Each fibrilla, h, appears to be built up of a row of short cjdindrical particles of

222 THE JOINTS. , The capsule of the hip joint, for the most part dense iind firm, is attached to the neck of the femur, in front, fig. 88, as far down as the anterior trochanteric line, and, elsewhere, nearly to the root of the greater trochanter ; above, it is fixed to the cotyloid ligament and the rim of the ace- tabulum. Its lower part is thin and loose, fig. 90, but it is thicker above, and, especially, in front; its upper part is supported by fibres from the reflected portion of the tendon of the rectus femoris muscle. This capsule is fortified by four strong accessory ligaments ; first, the ilio-femoral liga- ment, fig. 89, a very strong band, often half-an-inch thick, narrow above, but spreading out below, which extends from the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium, over the front of the cap- sule, to the anterior inter-trochan- teric line of the femur; secondly, the ilio-trochanteric ligament, fig. 89, reaching from near the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium to the front of the root of the g'eater trochanter, and adjacent part of the neck of the femur; thirdly, the pubo-femo- ral ligament, proceeding from the pubic bone, near the aceta- bulum, to the front of the smaller trochanter and neighbouring part of the neck of the femur; and, lastly, the orbicular ligament, situated on the back of the cap- sule, which, extending between the ilio-trochanteric and pubo- femoral ligaments, closely em- braces the hind part of the neck of the femur, and receives certain longitudinal fibres descending from the hip-bone, which, therefore, do not reach the femur itself.

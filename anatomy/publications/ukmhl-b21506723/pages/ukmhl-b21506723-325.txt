MUSCLES OF THE THIGH. 305 versely between the pelvis and the s/^a.^ npper part of the femur, lie entirely "~^^^tTJXv,6 ^ ^ concealed by the gluteus maximus. They consist, beginning from below, of the quadratus femoris, the ob- turator externus, the obtm-ator internus with the two gemelli, and the pyriformis. Quadratus femoris, figs. 143, 144, Deep ; short, square ; nearly horizontal, forming a flat vertical plane, situated above the adductor magnus. Outer border of ischial tuberosity, close to the origin of the great adductor tubercle on the posterior inter- trochanteric line, and upper part of the linea quadrati of the femur. Obturator externus, figs. 143, 144, Deep, outside the pelvis ; flat, triangidar, converging to a narrow tendon; nearly horizontal, but oblique backwards and out- wards, from the outer surface of the pelvis, beneath and behind the hip- joint. Inner two thirds of the outer surface of the margin of the obturator foramen, and anterior half of the obturator membrane digital fossa of the greater troch- anter. Its cord-like tendon of insertion lies between the quad- ratus and the inferior gemellus. Obturator internus, figs. 142, 143, 144, Deep, partly within, and partly outside the pelvis ; large, thick, triangular, its fasciculi converging to a series of from three to five tendinous slips, which unite into one tendon of insertion ; within the pelvis, obliquely back- wards to the inner border of the Fig. 144.â€”The Rotators, Vasti, and Great Adductor

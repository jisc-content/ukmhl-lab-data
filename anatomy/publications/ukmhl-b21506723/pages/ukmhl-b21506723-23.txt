3 INTEODUCTION. form, when met with in perfection, whether in infancy, yoiith, manhood, womanhood, or age, far transcends that of even the most elegant and beautiful of the mammalian group to which man himself belongs. It might, indeed, be urged that the very nakedness of the body in man, by which he is distinguished from animals generally, whose integument is for the most part provided with scales, horny plates, feathers, or hair, covering the greater portion of their surface, constitutes, as it were, a sort of pledge for the perfection and finish of his outward superficies. For, such a proposition is in entire agreement witli a principle almost universally recognisable and recognised in the organic world, whether vegetable or animal, according to which, whatsoever is exposed to view, is more finished and beautiful than what is hidden. Foliage and flowers and fruit are more beautiful than the boughs, stalks and stems, which support them, and which are in a measure concealed by them ; whilst these again are more beautiful than the roots whicli are buried in the earth. The stripped body of a bird, or of one of the well- covered mammalia,â€”take for examples, the barn-door cock, the cat, and the rabbit, is hideous and ghastly to beliold ; but, in their covered condition, tliey are beautiful in outward form, their beauty deiiending entirely on the amount, arrangement, and colour, of the flowing plumage or of the soft, abundant, hairy investment, or fur. In other cases, however, where the hairy coat is thinner and more compact, as in the greyhound, and in the finest breed of horses, the underlying forms of the body are, in themselves, much more attrac- tive, although, even in these, the characters are modified, and the beauty is heightened, by the fine, close, hairy coat. In certain exceptional cases, again, as in the hog, tapir, elephant and rhinoceros, where the integument is almost destitute of haii', either the subjacent structures are partly concealed by an unusual amount of fat beneath the skin, or they are still more effectually masked by scuta, or by irregular folds of thick integument, massive, inelegant, of inferior beauty, but yet less unpleasing to the sight than would be the naked flesh, and less so than a rabbit or bird denuded of its hair or feathers. But, in contrast with all these, and far surpassing them, man possesses a soft smooth integument which, with a limited quantity of fatty tissue, conceals and yet reveals the underlying structures, which in themselves, moreover, present- extremely fine local form; whilst, in the more highly favoured races, the skin itself, from its proper delicate colour, its partial translucency, its qualified transmission of the tint of the blood and of the subjacent tissues, has a fair and pearly lustre, or a darker and warmer tone, incomparable in quality, and almost or quite inimitable in effect, when contrasted with the stripped or naked skin of any of the animals with which, in this respect, he can properly be compared. The beauty of the human form, however, does not by any means reside entirely in its superficial covering, but it depends essentially on that of the B 2

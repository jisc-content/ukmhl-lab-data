THE FEMALE SKELETON. 191 this is due to an increased width of its lateral masses, the bodies of the sacral vertebrjB being actually narrower and smaller than in the male, so that the sacral promontory intrudes less into the pelvic cavity. The female sacrum is less overlapped behind by the two innominate bones, so that the posterior superior spinous processes of the ilia, are further apart, the difference being- even more marked than in the case of the anterior superior spinous processes. Although the upper part of the female sacrum is proportionally very wide, the Figs. 71 and 72.â€”Female Pelvis, back and front. lower part is narrow and tapering, and the coccyx is slender and moveable. The sacrum and the coccyx together, are proportionally long and flat, so that they form part of a larger curve than in the male. As is best seen in a side view, the sacrum projects more backwards, or is placed more obliquely, so that its dorsal surface is less vertical in the female. Most of these differences produce some effect on the surface forms. The iliac furrow, corresponding, on each side, with the iliac crest, is not only longer, but less elevated above the

THE MUSCLES. 428 head. The differences in the muscular system, due to occupation, character and race, are more striking than even those which occur in the bones, for they are more obvious to ordinary observation. The arm of the blacksmith, or the shoulder of a cricketer, the limbs of a Hercules, and the calf of the Negro, manifest well-known peculiarities referable to the greater or less amount of work performed by the muscles of those parts ; in the last-named case, the gastrocnemius is less developed, owing, it is thought, to the greater leverage afforded by the elongated heel; or, as it may be put, the shorter OS calcis of the European type, compels a larger development of the muscles of the calf. The integument or final covering of the human body, is so soft and beautiful in woman, that its characteristic appearances may preferably be noticed in her. The colour of the skin, in all races and complexions, its tone in the dark ones, and its brilliancy in the white ones, are so remarkable, that its successful imitation in pigments is exceedingly difficult. It is translucent, and yet more or less opaque ; it transmits some light, but it re- flects still more, as may be perceived at a theatre, or at an open-air assemblage of people, when it will be found that the human faces, necks and hands are strikingly discernible; and that, in spite of the amount of colour in the skin, it is more luminous than most costumes, of similar, or even of more diluted, hues. This distinguishing quality of the skin, is probably due, in great measure, to the multitude of little reflecting surfaces, formed by the lozenge- shaped angular facets between the intersecting lines and furrows of the cutis, and to the glassy brightness of the dry film of cuticle upon them ; the latter property completely explains the dazzling character of the high lights upon the skin, where it is directly illuminated. Both conditions, not only assist in imparting brightness to the integument, under direct illumination, but also account for the remarkable amount of light and colour, reflected from it, even when it is in shadow. The complex hues of the purest coloured skin, are due to many causes, namely: to the nearly white colour of the cutis itself; to the thin streamlets of blood in its superficial vessels, which, circulating through the skin generally in minute quantities, gives it its pale pinkish colour, but in the palms and soles, around the joints, and, especially, in the face, where the capillary vessels are large, and approach very near the surface, imparts to it a delicate rosy colour, or a carmine blush ; to the transparent, yellowish adipose tissue, which contains some fluid fat; where fat is absent or scanty, to the darker colour of the subjacent muscles, as upon the eyelids, or over the interosseous muscles on the back of the hand ; to the glis- tening white of tendons, as over the extensor tendons on the metacarpal bones, or over those just above the front of the wrist; and, lastly, to the presence of subcutaneous veins, which, owing to the interception by the skin and the coats of the veins, of most of the red rays, and the freer transmission of the

13 THE BONES. THE SKELETON". The human body consists of a hard internal bony framework, named the skeleton, more properly the endo-skeleton (Jv^ov, within ; crKaXsrov, a dry body), of certain surrounding and enclosed soft parts, including the muscles or flesh, the viscera or various organs, the blood-vessels, absorbents and nerves, and of the general integument or skin, with which are associated the external organs of the senses. Certain tegumentary parts, such as the teeth, nails and hair, are representations of the exo- or dermo-skeleton of animals {s^co, without; Sipi^a, skin) ; whilst in the muscular and tendinous systems, situated between Iheexo-and endo-skeletons, are found certain bony nodules, such as the sesamoid bones of the foot and hand, and the patella or knee-pan, which constitute re- presentatives of the sdero-skeleton {(tkXtjpos, hard). The part of the science of anatomy which relates to the bones, is named Osteology {oariov, a bone ; A070s, a discourse). The skeleton is composed of a large number of separate hones, which are connected together at the jomte or articidations (cm'^i ctt^us, a joint), and which thus form certain cavities for the protection of the viscera, and their main- tenance in their due position, and also form fulcra and levers, for the support and movement of the body and of the limbs. The muscles clothe the skeleton, whilst the skin covers all. The Parts of the Skeleton.â€”The Names and Connexions OF the Bones. The entire skeleton, like the body of which it forms the solid internal frame- work, presents for the purposes of description, a central portion, which comprises the head, neck, and trunk, and four appendages, two on each side, the upper and lower limbs. Fig. 1 shows these parts, and is intended, moreqver, to serve as a key or

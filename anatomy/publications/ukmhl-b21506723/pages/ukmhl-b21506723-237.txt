217 THE JOINTS OF THE LOWER LIMB. encloses the joint, and fills in the intervals between the special ligaments. It is attached above to the femur, in front and at the sides to the patella and to the inter-articular cartilages, and below to the tibia; it is strengthened, generally, by the fascia which invests the lower limb, and also by tendinous ex- pansions from the surrounding muscles, figs. 140, 142, 145. In front of the joint, below the patella, and reaching from that bone to the anterior tuber- osity of the tibia, is the broad, thick prolongation of the tendon of the great extensor muscles, the Ivjamentum patellce, sometimes named the anterior ligament of the knee, figs. 86, 140, I p. Of the proper ligaments, the posterior is a strong wide band, figs. 86, 144, formed partly by the capsule of the joint, and partly by fibres reflected from The Knee Joint laid open. jfjQ. 83.

Back view, showing the crucial ligaments, and posterior margins of the semilunar libro-cartilages. Fig. 85. Front view, the femur thrown a little back, the patella, with the greater part of its ligament, having been removed; it shows the crucial ligaments and anterior margins of the semilunar fibro-cartilages. the tendon of the semi-membranosus muscle ; it also receives fibres from the tendons of the popliteus and gastrocnemius. It passes obliquely from the back of the internal tibial tuberosity, to the outer condyle of the femur. The lateral ligaments, as in hinge joints generally, are of great strength, and are fixed further back than the centre of motion in the joint. The internal lateral ligament, figs. 83 to 85, a broad flat band, passes from the tubercle on the inner condyle of the femur, to the internal tuberosity and side of the tibia; it blends with the capsule of the joint; its deep surface, partly free

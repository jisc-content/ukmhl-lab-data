369 THE MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. It extends all the phalanges of the fingers, then the wrist, and even the elbow; it also has a tendency to separate the fingers, as it extends them, whilst the flexor muscles, on the contrary, bring the fingers together. Extensor minimi digiti^ figs. 177, 183, 185, Superficial; long and slender, with a delicate tendon; de- scends on the inner side of the com- mon extensor, but passes, between the radius and ulna, through a separate com- partment of the posterior annular liga- ment, on to the back of the carpus, the fifth metacarpal bone, and the little finger. Common tendon of origin of the digital extensors——dorsal aspect of the last two phalanges of the little finger. As an accessory of the common extensor, it assists in extending the little finger, and then, also, the wrist, and even the elbow; acting alone, it extends the little finger independently of the others, an habitual action by no means uncommon, and fre- quently inherited in families. The little finger has been named the auricular finger, from its adaptation to the office of rubbing or cleansing the meatus or opening of the ear ; hence this muscle is also named auricularis. Extensor vndiois^ figs. 175, 177, 183, ^® Covered by the common extensor ; elongated and rounded, end- ing, just above the back of the wrist, in a flat tendon ; this descends in the same compartment as the common extensor tendon, but covered by it, and then ac- companies the slip of that tendon to the back of the carpus, metacarpus, and forefinger, placed somewhat to its inner or ulnar side. Lower half of the back of the ulna, below the extensors of the thumb, and adjacent interosseous mem- brane dorsal aspect of the last two phalanges of the forefinger.

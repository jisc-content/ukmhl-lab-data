152 THE BONES. The horizontal portion of the bone, below and in front of the curved line and the occipital protuberance, is concealed by the muscles of the neck, and does not influence the surface forms; but, nevertheless, it must be described, as forming the part of the cranium which articulates with the first cervical vertebra. In it, is the foramen magnum, f, a large, oval aperture, with sloping margins, having its long axis directed from before backwards, and its plane nearly horizontal, which leads upwards into the cranial cavity, corre- sponds with the vertebral canal, below, and gives passage to the spinal cord, as this passes down from the brain. On the sides of the foramen magnum, are 0 Fig. 61.â€”The Base of the Skull. 0, occipital bone ; b, basilar process ; o', left occii^ital condyle ; e, occipital protuberance ; /, foramen magnum ; I, superior curved line.

Like these surfaces, the occipital condyles are ear-shaped, being slightly incurved on their inner, and rounded on their outer, border ; they are situated nearer to the front of the foramen magnum, and converge slightly forwards. Their under surfaces, smooth and convex from before backwards, are not horizontal from side to side, but slope downwards and inwards, the outer border being less prominent than the inner one. so that the plane of the surfaces

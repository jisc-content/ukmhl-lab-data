381 SURFACE-FORMS OF THE UPPER LIMB. The hollow of the elbow is continued down the front of the fore-arm, by the principal intermuscular marking, which separates the flexor and pronator group from the supinator and extensor group of muscles. The general mass of the former group, occupies the greater part of the anterior surface of the fore-arm, and also its inner border, with a small part of the hinder surface ; that of the latter group occupies a small part of the anterior surface, as well as the outer border, with the greater part of the hinder surface ; they meet at, or are separated behind by, the undulating or sinuous ulnar furrow. The intermuscular marking, just mentioned as placed between them in front, opens out below, opposite the tendinous parts of the muscles, into a wide and shallow longitudinal plane, which reaches down nearly to the wrist, but is obliterated towards its lower end by the prominence of the lower part of the radius ; it is occupied by the flexor longus pollicis. The general mass of the flexor and pronator group is pointed above, at the inner condyle of the humerus, and is somewhat compressed below that condyle, where it is crossed by the oblique bands of the bicipital fascia ; it then quickly enlarges to its fullest breadth, after which it gradually tapers down to the wrist. The supinator and extensor mass, on the other hand, commences, above the elbow, in the arm, emerging as a very characteristic oblique elevation from between the brachialis and the triceps, acquires its greatest breadth on a level with the external condyle of the humerus, higher up than the pronator and flexor mass, tapers downwards more suddenly, and ends in a longer and straighter line, reaching nearly down to the wrist. Hence, the different contours of the outer and inner borders of the fore-arm. Each of the two chief masses formed by the muscles of the fore-arm, presents intrinsic muscular and tendinous surface- forms, separated by subordinate intermuscular markings and intertendinous planes or depressions. In the position of supination, the surface-forms of the pronator and flexor group have an oblique direction, downwards and outwards, on the front of the fore-arm, and those of the supinator and extensor group, downwards and inwards, on the back of the fore-arm; but when the fore-arm is in the position of pronation, the aspects of the wrist are so changed in relation to the inner and outer condyles of the humerus, that the musculo-tendinous forms and intermediate markings, of both groups, pursue a more nearly longitudinal direction on the two flattened surfaces of the fore-arm. The outermost elevation on the 'pronator and flexor mass, next below that of the pronator teres, is produced by the fleshy and tendinous parts of the flexor carpi radialis; it is rounded and full above, but ends in a narrower, nearly longitudinal ridge below, which runs down towards the inner part of the ball of the thumb, opposite to the junction of the outer with the middle third of the front of the wrist; if prolonged, the line of this tendon would pass through the base of the second metacarpal bone, and then out of the palm

198 THE BONES. thigh-bones become shorter and more nearly at a right angle with the shafts; the heads of those bones become smaller; the lower limbs are bent at the ankle, knee, and hip, and the pelvis becomes tilted forwards, by the now feebly supported super-incumbent weight; whilst the several components of the vertebral column, the ribs and the sternum, the clavicles and the scapulae, become adapted to the stooping position of the back and shoulders. In all these changes, the individual bones participate, especially their articular extremities and surfaces. The neck becomes inclined forwards, and the cranium and face drop upon the neck. The teeth falling out, the alveolar borders of the jaws are absorbed, the alveoli disappear, and a thin firm margin of bone alone remains. The tuberosity of the upper jaw wastes, and the ramus of the lower jaw becomes oblique, and its angle very obtuse ; the convex profile line of the front of the superior maxillary bone, and the vertical contour of the front of the lower jaw, now each incline backwards to the other, so that the mouth recedes, whilst the chin becomes slanting, and approaches more closely to the nose. The depth of the lower part of the face is thus diminished, as in the infantile face. All the osseous forms, however, instead of being concealed and rounded, become angular, and more plainly revealed beneath the surface, in the aged and decrepit frame.

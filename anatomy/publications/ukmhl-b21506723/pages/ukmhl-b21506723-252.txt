THE JOINTS. 232 rib, with the under surface of the inner end of the clavicle; although this ligament does not enter directly into the formation of the sterno-clavicular joint, it materially strengthens the connexion between the two bones. Movements.—The sterno-clavicular articulation is very strong. The effects of blows on the outer end of the collar-bone, are admirably resisted by the peculiar attachments of the inter-articidar cartilage, namely, to the sternum at its lower edge, and to the collar-bone at its upper edge. If its points of attach- ment were reversed, its means of resistance against such blows, would be seriously impaired. The cartilage also acts as a cushion, or pad, to deaden shock, and it likewise serves to better adapt the bony surfaces, which, from their difference in size and form, are inadequate to fit each other. The move- FlG. 98.—The Ligaments of the sternal, sterno-claviculai-, and scaijulo-clavicvilar articulations and those of the shoulder joint. The left sterno-clavicular joint is opened to show the interarticular fibro-cartilage. Tendons of capsular muscles are seen on the shoulder-joint. ments at this joint are as varied as those of a ball-and-socket joint; namely, elevation and depression, backward and forward movements, a circumductory movement on the inner end of the collar bone, and also a slight movement of rotation on its axis. These are all especially restrained by the strong costo- clavicular ligament. The Acromio clavicular Joint, and Coraco-Clavicular Liga- ments.—The above-named gliding joint is completed by a small wedge- shaped inter-articular Jibro-cartilage, a capsule, and superior- and inferior ligaments, fig. 98. This joint is mechanically weak, but the connexion of the collar-bone with the scapula, is further secured by the two powerful coraco- clavicular ligaments. Of these, the trapezoid ligament, fig. 98, descends from the oblique line on the under sui'face of the clavicle, to the inner border

44 THE BONES. Surface-forms dependent on the Bones of the Foot. The general breadtli of the entire foot, both on its upper and its under surface, and especially across the metatarsus, depends essentially on the bony framework, and is particularly characteristic of Man, The height of the instep, and the elevation of the plantar arch, equally dependent on its osseous fabric, are also special characters in the human foot. The hollow under part of the foot, widening from the heel to the heads of the metatarsal bones, but after- wards becoming narrower at the toes, is, almost throughout, covered with soft parts, so that but few bony prominences affect the surface directly. The position of the broad, nearly oval, weight-bearing portion of the os calcis, of the hinder end and tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal bone, and of the heads of all the metatarsal bones, the sesamoid bones concealing the head of the first metatarsal, can be readily recognised even tlirough the thick pad of integument which covers them. Certain tendons however pass over all these parts, except over the tuberosities of the os calcis, and that of the fifth metatai'sal bone. In advance of the well-padded anterior metatarsal curve, the foremost part of which corresponds with the head of the second metatar- sal bone, are seen the projecting but flattened pads or pulps of the toes, which correspond with the horse-shoe-shaped under surfaces of the ungual phalanges, the other phalanges being recessed in the deep transverse groove in front of the anterior metatarsal curve, dependent on the extremely flexed position of the second on the first phalanges. At the back of the foot, is the rounded pi'ojection produced by the under- lying subcutaneous part of the os calcis, bounded by the attachments to it of the tendo Achillis, and other soft parts. On the outer thinner border of the foot, which is overhung by the outer ankle, commencing from behind, the prominent bony points are the ex- ternal tuberosity of the os calcis and the ridge between its hinder and outer surfaces; just beneath the ankle-bone, the peroneal tubercle, when this is pre- sent; much further forward, the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal bone, and then the head of the bone with the base of the first phalanx of the little toe. On the inner thicker and rounded border of the foot, which is overhung by the inner ankle, are, commencing from behind, the ridge between the hinder and inner surfaces of the os calcis ; only very indistinctly seen, the pro- minence of the sustentaculum tali, and a small adjacent part of the head of -the astragalus, below the inner ankle-bone ; in front of this, the well-marked tuberosity of the scaphoid bone ; much more obscurely seen, the sliglit pro- minence formed by the internal cimeiform and the base of the first metatarsal bone ; beyond this, the projection indicating the position of the enlarged head of the first metatarsal and the base of the adjoining phalanx of tlie great toe,

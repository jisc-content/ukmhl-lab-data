2G2 THE MUSCLES. muscles ; or, lastly, it may be in different stages of active contraction^ from the most moderate to the most vigorous exercise of its power, and that, in different conditions of its fasciculi as to length. The most important changes of state in a muscle attached by both ends to bone, and their different effects on the surface-forms, are illustrated in the annexed representations of different conditions of the well-known and easily observed biceps muscle of the arm, perhaps the most independent and freely moving muscle in the whole body. In fig. 121, tlie entire arm being dependent, the elbow-joint extended, and the forearm supinated, this muscle is perfectly tranquil or relaxed, elongated to nearly its full extent, but, of course, in a state Figs. 121, 122, 123.—Three different conditions of the biceps muscle of the arm, to show their efEects on the outward or surface forms.—Fig. 121. The muscle relaxed, and stretched by gravity, the forearm supinated.—Fig. 122. The muscle moderately contracted, the fore- arm being flexed, and the radius pronated. Fig. 123.—The muscle contracted to its utmost, the forearm flexed, and the radius supinated. of tonic contraction. It is, accordingly, narrow, or slender, and its surfaces present gently and elegantly curved forms, altogether peculiar to this in- dividual muscle, of course, dependent, first, on the number, length and arrange- ment of its component fasciculi, and their mode of attachment to its two tendons of origin and to its single tendon of insertion, and, secondly, on the length, breadth, special form, and course of those tendons themselves. In this condition, the fleshy portion of the muscle obviously determines the delicate and complex undulating contour of the front of the arm, tapering gTadually, both upwards and downwards, into the tendon-forms; it is slightly indented oi flattened along the middle, Avhere the fasciculi are nearly parallel,

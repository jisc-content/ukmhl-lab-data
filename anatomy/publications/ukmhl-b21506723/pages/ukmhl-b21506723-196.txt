176 THE BONES. a little in front of the anterior borders of the mastoid processes, on a level with the middle of those bony prominences ; they of course project below the plane of the foramen magnum. It has been lately assumed by craniologists, treating of the dried skull, that this plane always corresponds with the horizontal axis of the orbits, but this conclusion is erroneous. The startling death's head appearance of the facial osseous framework, is almost entirely concealed by soft structures, a few of its more prominent parts only being subcutaneous. In front, in the middle line above, are certain portions of the nasal and superior maxillary bones, which form the bridge and sides of the nose ; below, is the triangular mental eminence, with its indented lower outline at the point of the chin, which gives prominence and breadth to that region. At each side, is the outer, partly subcutaneous surface of the malar eminence, running back into the zygomatic arch, and passing upwards and forwards into the adjacent portion of the orbital rim, which here recedes, and is covered only by the thin orbicularis palpebrarum; immediately beneath the hinder, receding part of the zygoma, and just in front of the external auditory meatus, is always to be felt, and sometimes to be seen, an elevation produced by the outer end of the condyle of the lower jaw; the pos- terior border of the ramus of the jaw is obscured by the parotid salivary gland, but, lower down, the small, prominent, everted portion of the lower border of the jaw, just in front of its angle, causes a very remarkable and evident point upon the surface form ; lastly, all round the under border of the face, the long, subcutaneous part of the margin of the jaw, from the angles to the symphysis, thin posteriorly, but much thicker and more rounded at the sides and in front, determines, under all positions of the neck or head, in a very definite manner, the general contour in this situation; at the same time, the actual line depends upon soft tissues, glandular, muscular, and fatty. The remaining bones of the face, are concealed, more or less completely, by muscles, as well as by fatty tissue and skin; the broad rami of the lower jaw are covered by the large masseter muscles ; the rest of the surface of that bone, and also the upper jaw-bones, up to the side of the nose and the inner and lower margins of the orbit, are concealed by fat, by the buccinator muscles, and by the numerous muscles of the upper lip ; the hollow eye-sockets are filled up by the eye-balls and other parts, covered in by the delicately formed eyelids; and the large repulsive opening of the anterior bony nares is quite obliterated by the projecting, softly modelled, cartilages of the nose, and its cutaneous covering. Variations in the Forms of the Head and Pace.â€”No description can communicate an adequate notion of the numerous modifications of the surface-forms of the head and face, which are due to variations in the size and shape of the cranial and facial bones. These parts, indeed, are the

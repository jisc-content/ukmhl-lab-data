Vastus intemus and crureus, the anterior, inner, and smaller portion of the triceps, figs. 139, 140, 142, 144, 24, 24//_ The crureus, con- cealed above, but the vastus intemus, 2*, superficial below, appearing between the rectus and the sartorius; very pointed and flattened above, but full and broad below; nearly vertical on the front and inner side of the femur, the fleshy part reaching lower down, and projecting more than the vastus externus. From almost the whole length of the front and inner side of the shaft of the femur, from the anterior intertrochanteric line, the spiral line, and the inner lip of the linea aspera, down to about two inches from the lower end of the bone —■■—with the tendons of the vastus externus and rectus, to the patella, reaching along its inner border. The fleshy fasciculi of the crureus are nearly vertical, but those of the vastus internus are first oblique, and then curved, and finally nearly horizontal just above the internal condyle ; the tendon of insertion commences upon the surface of the crureus, but beneath the vastus internus. Subcrureus. Deep and completely concealed by the crureus; a few bundles only; vertical. Lower part

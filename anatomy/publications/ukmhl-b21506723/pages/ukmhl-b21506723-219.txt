199 THE JOINTS. THE JOINTS CONSIDEEED GENERALLY. The places where the separate bones meet, and the parts which connect them, are called the joints or articulations {articulus, a joint). That part of the science of anatomy, which relates to the joints, is named Arthrology {dpdpov, a joint; Xoyos, a discourse). The joints permit the various movements of the body. The shape of the bony surfaces, which enter into their formation, determines the character, whilst the position, length, and strength of the soft parts, which hold the bones together, regulate the extent of those movements. The muscles are the active agents; whilst the bones furnish fulcra and levers, to give effect to their action. The joints are divided into three classes, named, according to the degree of motion permitted at them, the Immoveable, the Mixed, and the Moveable Joints. The Immoveable Joints. The Immoveable Joints, or Synarthroses (o-i;!/, together ; dpdpov, a joint), include the several kinds of Suture met with in the cranium and the face. Some of these sutures, such as the lambdoidal, sagittal, and coronal sutures, are named dentate or serrated, because the edges of the bones are jagged {dens, a tooth; serra, a saw). These edges iit into each other, a thin layer of fibrous membrane, continuous with the periosteum, intervening between them. When, as in the lambdoidal suture, the borders of the adjacent bones are elevated, the suture is said to be limbous (limbus, a selvage). The squamous suture, has thin, bevelled, and overlapping margins. When the * opposed edges are linear and smooth, as in some of the articulations of the face, this more simple suture is termed harmonia {apjxovia ; ctpsiv, to fit). In a few cases, a ridge in one bone is received into a groove in another, and the union is called schindylesis (o-p^ii^SuXi/o-ts, a fissure) ; whilst the mode of fastening of a tooth into its socket, is termed gomphosis {yofitpos, a nail).

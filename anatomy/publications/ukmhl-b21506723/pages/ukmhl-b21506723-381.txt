361 THE MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. In pulling an oar, the biceps is the active muscle ; but in throwing or striking a ball, the triceps, as well as the great serratus, are energetically employed, the former to straighten the fore-arm, the latter to swing the shoulder-girdle forwards. The long head of the triceps, being fixed to the scapula, may de- press, adduct, and draw the humerus backwards, towards or upon the trunk. Anconeus, fig. 170, Super- ficial ; triangular, flat, narrow above ; diverging obliquely downwards and inwards, over the outer side and back of the elbow joint. Back of the external condyle of the humerus outer side of the olecranon, and triangular surface of the ulna, below it. This muscle seems like a con- tinuation of the outer part of the triceps, which it assists, in extend- ing the fore-arm ; during that move- ment, it probably guides the ulna on to the outer part of the back of the trochlea. It, perhaps also, ac- complishes that slight abduction of the ulna, which always accompanies, and aids, pronation of the radius. Placed deeply beneath the lower part of the triceps, but not beneath the anconeus, are two or three fleshy fasciculi, which arise from the back of the humerus, above the olecranon fossa, and are attached to the loose capsule of the elbow joint, below. They are analogous to the sub- crureus in the thigh, and have, there- fore, been named, though inexactly, the sub-anconeus; they draw the capsule and synovial membrane out of the way, in extension of the ioint. ^'ig. 170.â€”Posterior Muscle of the Arm, and Anconeus. The Muscles of the Fore-arm. The muscles of the fore-arm are easily arranged into an anterior and a posterior group, the former arising partly from the inner condyle of the humerus, and partly from the front of the ulna and radius, and the latter

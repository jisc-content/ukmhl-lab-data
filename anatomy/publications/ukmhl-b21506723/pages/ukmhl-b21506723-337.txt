317 SURFACE FORMS OF THE LOWER LIMB. of the fascia lata, it is more prominent laterally behind, where the thickest portion of the gluteus maximus exists, and where, especially during the contracted state, a very broad convex form is produced, above and behind the depressed area, within which the tendinous portion of the muscle and the greater trochanter are situated; the trochanter is, however, sometimes pro- minent, as when the thigh is thrown over the opposite limb. Anteriorly, the trochanteric depression is bounded by the elevation due to the tensor vaginae femoris; this muscle, which, seen from the front, balances the sartorius, yet descends from their common starting-point at a different inclination, and forms, not a prominent ridge, but a broad elevation, which is directed downwards and backwards towards the front of the greater troclianter, where it ends by an oblique or nearly vertical border. Acting on or from the ilio-tibial band of the fascia, it tightens that band, which then flattens the vastus externus, and produces the narrow tendon-like plane, on the outer side of the knee, in front of the more rounded ridge caused by the tendon of the biceps; the former leads to the outer tuberosity of the tibia, the latter to the head of the fibula, and there is a distinct sulcus between them. The integument in front of the knee joint is very loose. When the knee is bent, as the skin is tightened over the subjacent parts, its folds disappear, and the forms of the two vasti muscles, passing over the condyles of the femur, with the strong median tendon descending from the rectus and slightly spreading out as it reaches the patella, as well as the bony forms themselves, can be easily traced. When the knee is straight, and the patella in- drawn up by the rectus, the tendon and this bone also become visible, the former as a broad ridge, the latter as a depression between the soft parts pressed out around it; but when, as in standing at ease, the knee is straight, and the patella is let down or dropped, a soft cutaneous fold passes obliquely downwards and inwards over the inner condyle, completely obscuring the oppositely inclined form of the vastus internus. This fold corresponds with the line along which the skin, looser in front of the knee, becomes more firmly attached to the fascia above the joint, as may be shown by tucking the fingers under the fold, which can easily be done; the same thing can also be accomplished, on a smaller scale, over the first phalangeal joint in the fingers. The large transverse gluteal fold, below t^e gluteal region, is also a tegumentary form ; it does not follow strictly the lower border of the gluteus maximus muscle, but is due to the presence of a special accumulation of adipose tissue towards the inner portion of that fold. This not only furnishes a cushion of support to the body in the sitting posture, when it is drawn partly beneath the ischial tuberosity, and likewise serves the purpose of concealing the lower part of the trunk, but it changes the oblique line of the lower border of the gluteus maximus into a more nearly horizontal line. It thus affords an illustration of the use of fat in modifying the subjacent anatomical forms ; for, whereas

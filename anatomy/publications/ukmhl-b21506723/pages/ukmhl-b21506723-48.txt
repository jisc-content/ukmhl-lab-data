THE BONES. 28 sary particularly to bear in mind, that all surface forms and local proportions which are due to bony structures, of whatever kind or character tliey may be, whether prominent or depressed, are more determinate and less variable and fleeting, than those which are produced by softer and more yielding tissues. The deep-seated and well-covered parts of bones, are usually marked with lines, ridges, or depressions, bounded with flattened or uneven surfaces, or roughened, for the attachment of ligaments, tendons and muscles; or they present grooves, notches, or foramina, for the lodgment of tendons or the passage of vessels or nerves ; but in the subcutaneous parts of bones, these ir- regularities disappear, and the surface is smoother or even polished, and so gently modelled, that its outlines and contours compose and harmonise with the lines and forms of the neighbouring soft parts, all being covered by the skin. The frontal bone, the collar-bone, and the inner surface of the tibia, furnish the best illustrations of this harmony of form between adjacent hard and soft parts of the body, which, though resulting from a consentaneous development and growth, and of course adapted to the structural require- ments of those parts, seems indicative of a special design, having reference to beauty of form. Nevertheless, throughout the whole skeleton, all parts of the bones, the most uneven as well as the smoothest, present to close observation, forms of singular elegance, remarkable variety, and, very frequently, of admirable finish. This is especially true of the human skeleton. If we call to mind the flattened or disc-like plates of the bones of the fish's head, the simple curved bars of its jaws, and the slender thorn-like or needle-like character of its ribs,—the smooth unmodelled bones of the frog,—the sameness of the surfaces of the bones of the crocodile,—and even the somewhat varied but yet simple forms of the sternum, wing-bones, ribs, and leg-bones of the bird,— the fact soon becomes evident that, in none of these, is there manifested that intricacy of contour, form, and modelling, which strikes the eye so quickly in studying the bones of most of the mammalia. In these latter, especially, the limbs acquire a greater play of movement, the muscular system is necessarily increased in complexity, and the muscles themselves multiplied in their lines of action ; and, accordingly, the bones, the development of which is always in accordance with the forces acting upon them, become more varied in their prominences and depressions. But it is in Man, whose body is balancea erect on his lower limbs, or even, as in the alternate movements in walking or running, on one, whilst the upper limbs are devoted to so many special uses, that the relations of the muscles to the bones, and of the bones to the muscles, become most complex ; and in the human skeleton, therefore, the greatest variety and richness of modelling of the osseous surfaces is met with. A finely-formed, perfect, and well-prepared human skeleton is, indeed, an object of great intrinsic beauty ; it is the best example of what might truly be called

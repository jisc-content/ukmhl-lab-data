THE MUSCLES. 316 already been described; they are revealed clearly upon the surface, when the muscles are in action; but when these are at rest, as in standing at ease, they are obscured and modified by foldings of the skin. The adductor group fills in the large triangular space between the slanting femur and the inner border of the thigh, the contour line of the upper portion of which, is chiefly dependent on these muscles; they scarcely offer any marks or signs of subdivision into separate forms, but the tendon and inner edge of the adductor longus stand out in certain actions, as a well-marked narrow ridge, proceeding downwards and outwards from the pubes, and forming the inner side of a flattened and clearly defined triangular surface seen on the front of the upper part of the thigh, below the fold of the groin, and having its outer side bounded by the narrow oblique plane of the sartorius muscle ; in front of the lower part of the sartorius, and behind the lower part of the vastus internus, the tendinous cord of the great adductor makes itself felt, and sometimes momentarily seen, as a short ridge, running down towards the small tubercle on the face of the inner condyle. The thin gracilis muscle covers over and combines the forms of the inner edges of the adductor muscles, that of the great adductor being very thick, and thus, smooths the inner surface of the thigh above. The sartorius, lying in its sheath, in the oblique gutter-like bed, formed between the adductor and extensor groups, may be brought well into view, in the standing position, by flexing the thigh and leg, rotating the whole limb outwards, and carrying the foot towards the opposite leg; it then produces, at its upper end, a prominent conical ridge, widening downwards into a rounded elevation, which only gradually changes into a flattened plane, this being itself finally lost upon the general full and softly curved eminence, seen behind and below the inner side of the knee. At the back of the thigh, the flexor mass escapes from beneath the gluteal fold ; at first narrow and depressed, but lower down, wider and more prominent, it finally flattens out, and separates at an unequal angle, to form the two borders of the sunken lozenge-shaped popliteal space, and to constitute, below, the so-called hamstrings. The inner hamstring, descending obliquely inwards, contains the tendons of the semi-membranosus, semi-tendinosus, and gracilis, as well as the lower part of the still fleshy sartorius; it is thicker, more rounded, more prominent backwards, more oblique and more curved, and reaches lower down than the biceps or outer hamstring ; but, nevertheless, one of its cords, namely the tendon of the semi-tendinosus, sometimes starts up as a sharper ridge than that produced on the outer side by the tendon of the biceps, which, moreover, is thicker, and pursues a more direct and vertical course down, to the head of the fibula. The gluteal region, with its copious form, is redeemed from commonness, by the variety of its local modelling; compressed towards the fore part of the hip, where it inclines gently downwards and outwards from the pelvis and is supported by the denser part

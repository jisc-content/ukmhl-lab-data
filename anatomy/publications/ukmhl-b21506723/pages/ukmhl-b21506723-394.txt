374 THE MUSCLES. forming the balls or eminences of those digits, the ball of the thumb being known as the thenar eminence, and that of the little finger, as the hypo-thenar eminence (utto, under, Ohap, the palm). Flexor brevis minimi digiti, figs. 179, 181, Superficial, but crossed by the palmaris brevis muscle; fusiform; oblique, downwards and inwards. Tip of the unciform process, and anterior annular ligament base of the first phalanx of the little finger, together with the tendon of the abductor. This muscle is often incorporated with the abductor, or it may be absent. It flexes the first phalanx of the little finger, being assisted by the abductor and the long flexors ; it also co-operates with the op- ponens muscle. Flexor brevis pollicis, figs. 179, 181, Â»^ One portion deep, the other superficial; a large, double muscle, each part fusi- form; oblique, downwards and outwards, from the middle part of the carpus, through the ball of the thumb, the two parts sepa- rated by the tendon of the long flexor of the thumb. Deep or inner part, os magnum, trape- zoid bone, bases of the second and third metacarpal bones, and sheath of the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb; superficial or outer part, trapezium and anterior annular ligament inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. The tendon of each part encloses one of the sesamoid bones of the thumb; the deep or inner tendon joins that of the adductor, and the superficial or outer tendon, that of the abductor pollicis. This strong muscle flexes the thumb, and aids in drawing its metacarpal bone forwards and inwards. The long flexor tendons in the palm, figs. 172, 173, 181. These include the tendon of the long flexor of the thumb, and the four tendons of the deep and of the superficial flexors of the fingers. The tendon of the long flexor of the thumb, figs. 172 to 174, 181, passes beneath the annular ligament.

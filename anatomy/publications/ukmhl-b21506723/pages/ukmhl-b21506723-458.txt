This work has obtained an established reputation during the last twenty- years. In the New Edition each subject has been re-drawn on the zinc, and, under the supervision of the Author, important additions have been made to the series, so as to render it as complete as possible, and consistent with the present state of Science. Though expressly designed for the wider purpose of general education, supply- ing an acknowledged necessity of modern teaching, these Diagrams will be found not inapplicable to the requirements of professed Medical Schools, affording—aa they do—a correct preliminary view of the various systems and organs in the human body. To Lecturers at Literary, Scientific, and Mechanics' Institutes, or to the Committees of such Societies, this series would be peculiarly useful. EXPLANATORY KEY, 16 pp. 8vo. Is.

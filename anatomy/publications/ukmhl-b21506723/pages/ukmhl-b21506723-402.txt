382 THE MUSCLES. between the second and third fingers, when the hand is simply extended. On the inner side of this ridge, and separated from it by a narrow intertendi- nous depression, ending above in a slightly pronounced intermuscular marking, is a more slender ridge, caused by the delicate tendon of the palmaris longus, which runs quite superficially, especially below, where it spreads out a little, and is lost in the central part of the palm. Next, on the inner side of this, is an elongated triangular plane, widening out below, corresponding with the interval between the palmaris longus and the flexor carpi ulnaris, and occu- pied by the inner set of the tendons of the flexor sublimis digitorum; the thin ridge formed by the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, the innermost of the flexor group, is sharper but much less prominent, and placed on a lower level than those of the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus, which are much more conspicuous. The actual prominence of each of the flexor forms, is, however, dependent on the condition of the muscles which produce them. Thus, when the wrist only is flexed, the fingers and thumb being kept ex- tended, the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus are prominent, and nearly equally so ; when the fingers and thumb are in a state of easy semi-flexion, the tendon of the palmaris often sinks out of sight, whilst that of the radial flexor remains visible ; when the fingers and thumb, as well as the wrist, are firmly flexed, then the palmaris longus becomes more prominent than the radial flexor; in order to bring the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris into full prominence, it is necessary to adduct, as well as to flex, the hand at the wrist joint. Again, when the fingers and thumb are extended, or in a state of semi-flexion and quiet, their long flexor muscles and tendons fill up smoothly the intervals which they occupy between the flexors of the wrist and palm ; but when the hand is firmly clenched, the muscular portions of those long flexors are retracted up into the fore-arm, and, then, the tendon of the long flexor of the thumb is drawn in, so as to increase the hollow between the flexor carpi radialis and the supinator, whilst the tendons of the flexor sublimis project in the interval between the palmaris longus and the flexor carpi ulnaris. If, now, the little finger be very firmly closed, its short muscles are sufficiently strong to draw the somewhat move- able pisiform bone downwards and a little outwards, by which movement the tendon of the fiexor carpi ulnaris is tightened and made more prominent, the front of the wrist is slightly widened, and numerous vertical wrinkles are produced in the skin above the pisiform bone itself, to which the integu- ment is more or less attached. Beyond the full, fleshy form produced on the outer border of the upper part of the fore-arm by the long supinator muscle, overlying the two radial extensors of the wrist, subordinate intermuscular markings are recognisable between those muscles, between the radial extensors and the common extensor of the fingers, and between the extensor minimi digiti and the ulnar extensor

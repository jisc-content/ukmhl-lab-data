Soleus, figs. 134, 136, 137, 138, Covered by the gastrocnemius, except its two borders, of which the outer one is superficial throughout, and the inner one in its lower two thirds; broad, flat, pointed above, and shaped like a sole fish, (solea) ; vertical behind both bones of the leg, its numerous fasciculi ending in a broad, strong, flat aponeurosis, situated on the back of the muscle, and narrow- ing and thickening dovmwards, until it joins with the tendon of the gastrocnemius which covers it, to form the tendo Achillis, Hinder part of the head, and upper half, nearly, of the back of the fibula, oblique line of the tibia and middle third of its inner border, and a strong fibrous arch crossing from bone to bone the lower part of the back of the os calcis. The action of the soleus will be more usefully studied together with that of the gastrocnemius. Plantaris, figs. 136, 138, 20'^ pe^p ^nd covered, except at its lower end; its fleshy portion diminutive, fusiform, only two or three inches in length, ending in a veiy long- slender tendon, the longest in the body; oblique downwards and inwards, between the soleus and gastrocnemius, appearing, at its upper end, in the ham, in contact with the inner head of the latter, but below the middle of the leg, along the inner border of the tendo Achillis. A rough line above the external condyle of the femur and posterior ligament of the knee joint— back of the os calcis, with or close to the tendo Achillis, sometimes only to the internal annular ligament of the ankle, or to the adjacent fascia or subcutaneous fat at the back of that joint. This muscle may be double or wanting; it represents the palmaris longus in the fore-arm and palm, but its tendon does not reach the sole of the foot, (planta), as its name implies. u 2 2I» CO Fig. 137.—Muscles of the Leg Superficial view of the Calf.

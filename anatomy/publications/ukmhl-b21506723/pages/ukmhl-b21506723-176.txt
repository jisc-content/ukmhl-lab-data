156 THE BONES. they serve, on each side, for the attachment of a part of the temporal fascia, the concealed part of the bone below them giving partial origin to the correspond- ing temporal muscle. In front, fig. 63, the temporal ridges terminate at the two very pronounced external angular 'processes, which pass downwards and outwards on the outer side of the orbits, and join, by a thick indented edge, the corresponding malar bones, or cheek bones, M, and so form bonds of con- nexion between the cranium and the face. Commencing at the external angular processes, and curving inwards, over the orbits, towards the root of the nose, are the two strongly marked supra-orbital ridges or arches, which form the upper margins of those sockets ; the outer end of each arch, is very pro- FiG. 62.—Left side of the Skiill. o, occipital bone ; Z, superior curved line.

The inner ends of these arches, on the sides of the root of the nose, form the internal angular processes, which are much less prominent than the external processes. Between them, is the broad surface which assists in forming the root of the nose, and which, inclining backwards, produces here an indent- ation, of greater or less depth in different skulls, best seen in profile. Above this indentation, in the middle line, is the broad, somewhat triangular smooth

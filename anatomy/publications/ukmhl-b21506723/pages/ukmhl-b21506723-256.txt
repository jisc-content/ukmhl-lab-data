Extension, limited to a little beyond the straight posi- tion, is cliecked, as elsewhere, not by bony contact, of which we should at least be conscious, even if it were not painful, bnt by tlie tension of the an- FlG. 102.—Front view, showing the anterior and lateral ligaments.

In very violent extension, such as occurs in accidents, a collision doubtless occurs. In extension, the elbow Fig. 106.—Front view of the Elbow, and Eadio- FiG. 108.—Vertical median section ulnar joints laid open, showing edge of through the right elbow joint, show- is stiff and firm: in flexion, the joint exhibits a slight lateral play, the inner portions only of the trochlea of the humerus and of the sigmoid notch of the ulna, being then in perfect adaptation. The obliquity of these surfaces, in certain directions, causes an oblique or cross action of the ulna upon the The Ligaments of the Elbow, and Superior Kadio-ulnar Joints.

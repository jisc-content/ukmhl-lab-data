128 THE BONES. outer one, nearer to the radius, is smaller and shallower than the inner one, the two thus corresponding with the smaller outer part, and the larger and longer inner part of the trochlea. In this way, the mutually adapted siu-faces of the ulna and humerus, form the hinge-joint of the elbow. Near the deepest part of the greater sigmoid notch, its outer and inner borders are indented, so that the articular surface is constricted; sometimes it is interrupted quite across, no cartilage existing there ; the indentation or space is occupied by fat and blood- vessels. The eminence in front of the greater sigmoid notch, named the coronoid process, figs. 53, 55 ^Kopcovi], tip of a bow), is curved backwards, and somewhat pointed; when the forearm is bent, it is received into the coronoid fossa, in front of the lower end of the humerus. The eminence sur- FiG. 53, front view, FiG. 5i, back view, and FiG. 55, inner side of the right Kadius and Ulna, placed parallel with each other, in the position of supination. Fig. 56, front view, and FiG. 57, back view of the same bones, with the Radius across the Ulna, in the position of pronation. The two small sketches belong, respectively, to Figs. 53 and 56, and show the lower ends of the Radius and Ulna, in supination and pronation ; the direction of movement of the Radius is indicated by the dotted lines. mounting the notch behind, and reaching much higher than the coronoid process, is named the olecranon process or olecranon, figs. 54, 55 {mXsvt], the elbow ; Kpdvos, a helmet), because it forms the cap of the elbow. It is broad and square at its upper end, not pointed like the coronoid process, and, during extension of the forearm, is received into the deep and wide olecranon fossa, at the back of the lower end of the humerus; it is nearer to the inner than to the outer condyle of that bone. Its broad, truncated, and roughened upper end, and also its sides and margins, afford insertion to the triceps muscle of

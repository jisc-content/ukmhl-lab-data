304 THE MUSCLES. Fig. 143.â€”The Flexor and Rotator Groups first on the back of the muscle; obliquely downwards and outwards, its long head behind the adductor magnus, its short head parallel with the hinder border of the vastus internus, at first in con- nexion with, then in contact with the semi-tendinosus, finally sepa- rating from that and the semi- membranosus, its fleshy fibres descending lower down than the latter, and its tendon forming by itself the outer hamstring. The long head, from the back of the ischial tuberosity, by a conjoined tendon with the semi-tendinosus, the short head, from the middle part of the lower two thirds of the linea aspera of the femur, the oblique line leading to the back of the outer condyle, and the external intermuscular septum head of the fibula, by two distinct ten- dinous bands, which embrace the external lateral ligament of the knee joint, and send forwards an expansion on to the tibia. It is a powerful flexor of the leg and extensor of the thigh, being thus associated, both anatomically and in its action, with the semi- tendinosus ; but it rotates the fibula and tibia outwards, when the knee is bent. Acting from below, it supports the knee joint, draws the pelvis backwards, and sustains it, from behind, in the upright posture. The Rotator Group, figs. 142, 146.

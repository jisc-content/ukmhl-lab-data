22 THE BONES. of tlie tarsal bones, being all firmly connected together, but moving in mass, with some freedom, on the os calcis and astragalus, which form the hinder group. The metatarsus, which succeeds to the tarsus, has five bones, numbered as in the hand, one for the support of each toe, but, unlike the metacarpal bones, they are all arranged side by side, parallel with each other, the adjacent lateral surfaces of their hinder ends be- ing articulated together. They are firmly connected behind, three with the three cuneiform bones, and two with the cuboid bone; but, in front, they form very moveable joints with the first or proximal phalanges of the several toes ; beneath this joint, in the great toe, are two sesamoid bones. The phalanges of the toes, P'i4 , fourteen in number, as in the thumb and fingers, two for the gi'eat toe, and three for each of the other toes, are named as in the hand, first, second and third, or 'proximal, middle, and distal or terminal; whilst the last or nail-hearing phalanx, is here also named the ungual phalanx. The second phalanges of the fourth and fifth toes, and the ungual phalanges of all but that of the great toe, are very small bones. The great toe is named the hallux i^aWofiai, hallomai, to bound or spring). Although the phalanges of tlie four outer toes are much smaller than the corresponding phalanges of the hand, yet those of the great toe are larger than those of the thumb. The bones of the lower limbs are, with the exception of these phalanges, larger than the corresponding bones of the upper limbs; they are employed in standing, and in locomotion.

THE MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. 327 Spinales dorsi et colli, fig. 150, Deep; variable longitudinal slips, situated on the inner border of, and associated with, the erector spinse, remarkable for both arising from and being inserted into the spinous processes. Spinalis dorsi, upper two lumbar, and lower two dorsal spines upper eight dorsal spines; spinalis colli, upper two dorsal, and lower two or three cervical spines second and third cervical spines. The action of the two erectores spinse in straightening the back, as in rising from the stooping posture, is indicated by their name. Continuing to act, they bend the trunk backwards, this movement, however, as has been explained, occurring chiefly at the loins. The two musculi accessorii and spinales dorsi co-operate with the erectors. The cervicalis ascendens, transversalis colli and trachelo-mastoid, and also the complexus and spinalis colli, of the two sides, straighten and bend back the neck, the trachelo-mastoid likewise acting thus on the head. In each case, the muscles of one side incline the loins, back, neck or head, to their own side, slightly rotating them to that side, except in the case of the complexus, which rotates the face to the opposite side. The lower portions of the erector spinae may aid the expiratory movements; but if the neck be fixed, the upper portions of these and of the cervicalis ascendens, would be inspiratory. The trachelo- mastoid and the complexus, approximate the side of the head to the shoulder. The fascia lumborum and the ver- tebral fascia or aponeurosis, fig. 152. The fascia of the loins, is formed by the splitting of the broad tendon of the deepest of the three muscles which form Fig. 152.â€”The Divergent Dorsal Group, in the Back and Neck, with the Lumbar and Vertebral Fascise.

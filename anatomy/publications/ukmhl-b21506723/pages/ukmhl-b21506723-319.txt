MUSCLES OF walking, it draws the hinder limb forwards, and then projects it in advance of the pelvis. Acting from below, it supports the pelvis on the inner side of, and, likewise, behind the hip joint; it may also depress the pelvis in either of these directions. This the great eques- trian muscle, accomplishing the grip of the knees upon the animal or saddle. Adductor longus, figs. 139, / 141, Superficial, except below, / where it is covered by the sartorius and gracilis ; flat, triangular, elon- gated and elegant, with its apex at the pubes ; oblique downwards and outwards. Front of the os pubis, \ close below the junction of the crest \ with the sjrmphysis, by a narrow flat tendon, middle third of the inner lip of the linea aspera, by an aponeurosis, connected with the adductor magnus and vastus in- ternus. Its actions resemble those of the adductor magnus ; but it is a more direct flexor of the thigh upon the pelvis, and of the pelvis upon the thigh. Adductor brevis, figs. 139,141, Deep seated, concealed by the long adductor, pectineus, and sar- torius ; flat, elongated, nearly quadrangular; oblique downwards, outwards, and somewhat backwards. Outer surface of the descending ramus of the os pubis the line leading from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera of the femur, and a small part of that line itself. Its action is the same as that of the adductor longus. THE THIGH. 299 Fig. 141.â€”The Adductor Group.

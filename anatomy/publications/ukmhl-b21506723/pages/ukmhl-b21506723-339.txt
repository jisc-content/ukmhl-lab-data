THE MUSCLES OF THE TEUNK. 319 The muscles of the Trunk include those of the Back and Neck, tlie Thorax, the Abdomen, and the Shoulder. Each of these sets consists of more than one layer, those of the Back, especially, being so numerous, as to be usually arranged in five distinct layers. Moreovei-, many of the muscles of one region pass also into another, so that no precisely regional classification of them is possible. For the present purpose, ifc is better, whilst paying due regard to their connexions and uses, to ar- range them in topographical groups; for, in this way, their relations to the forms of the torso, will be better understood. The annexed Table indicates all these muscles, arranged in order from the deepest to the most superficial, in each group; the numbers, as before, are those by which they are referred to, in the several figures in which they occur. In the succeeding descriptions, the same order is observed. The Deep Vertebral Group, figs. 147, 148.â€” This contains the following small,* short muscles, con- nected with the vertebriP, or with the occiput, which is a modified vertebra.

THE MUSCLES. 256 The Ixfluence of the Muscular Sv^stem ox the General AND Local Forms. The manifest influence of the muscles on the surf ace-fcn'tns of the body, figs. 119, 198, 199, justifies the minutest examination of every detail con- cerning their form, structure, and connexions. The deeper-seated muscles, in this respect, are of less importance than the superficial ones ; they are hidden from view, but they serve to fill up the hollows, vacuities, and angular intervals existing in the hai'd framework of the body ; they form the first fleshy clothing of the bones. But the superficial muscles cover nearly every part of the skeleton, save only those subcutaneous parts, which have been fully described with the bones themselves; moreover, in man, in whom the erect position demands a more uniform distribution of the muscular organs around the osseous columns of support, they nearly everywhere determine, by their position and mass, the outward general and local form of the body and limbs; they give breadth and smoothness to the trunk, and special round- ness and richness to the limbs; whereas, in quadrupeds, the body is more flattened on the sides, and the movements of the limbs are more simply hinge- like, to and fro, so that the muscles and tendons are placed chiefly in front of and behind the bones, and the general form of the limbs is also flattened laterally. The introduction of long tendons in the limbs, especially in the leg and fore-arm, and on the toes and fingers, not only, as already stated, economises the more highly organised contractile tissue, and conveys the action of the muscles conveniently to great distances, but it also aids in lightening the weight, and in tapering the general forms of the limbs in their distal segments, and thus adds greatly to their elegance and beauty. Unlike the straps and bands used in certain machinery, tendons, whether rounded or flat, never present quite straight borders or squared ends; their width continually varies, their edges are oblique or gently cmved, and their attach- ments spread out, so as not only to take good hold of the bones to which they are fixed, but, if superficial enough, to blend finely and imperceptibly with the harder contours of these. The forms of the deeper-seated muscles, including both their fleshy and their tendinous portions, are, for the most part, simple, their outlines being often geometrical, linear, triangular, or quadrangular, and their surfaces flat; but those of the superficial muscles, which are so far exposed that they actually determine the smface-forms, are, as regards their tendons or aponeuroses, as well as their muscular portions, singularly complex both in outline and mass, presenting graceful contours and richly modelled surfaces of the most varied character, flowing agreeably into each other. The local details of the surface-

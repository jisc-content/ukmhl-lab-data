THE MUSCLES OF THE HAND. 371 extensor of the metacarpal bone, is also a special abductor of the thumb itself, and hence has been named, the long abductor of the thumb. The Muscles of the Hand. There is no muscle on the back of the hand corresponding with the short extensor of the toes in the foot; but the dorsal interosseous muscles are here visible between the metacarpal bones, and the long extensor tendons also pass down the back of the hand. All the muscles of the hand, are accessible from the palm, arranged in superimposed layers; and, as in the foot, the long flexor tendons descend into it, from the part of the limb above it. The groups into which the muscles of the palm, which act upon the digits, may be arranged, are an abductor and adductor group, an opponent group, and Fig. ] 78.—Abductor and Adductor FiG. 179.—Short Flexors, Abductors, Adductors, Group. and Opponent Muscles. a short flexor group. The long tendons either act on the carpus and pro- carpus, at the wrist-joint and transverse carpal articulation, or they pass down to the fingers and thumb, which they serve to bend or straighten. To one set of these, the lumbricales muscles are attached. There is also a special cutaneous palmar muscle, connected with the palmar fascia, which, as well as the dorsal fascia and the annular ligaments of the wrist, must here receive attention.

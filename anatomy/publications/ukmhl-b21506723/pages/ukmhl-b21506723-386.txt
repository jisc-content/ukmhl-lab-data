THE MUSCLES. 366 ah" cc ^ ixi "2 en O UJ S£ o X the wrist; three extensors of the fingers, namely the common extensor, the extensor of the little finger, and that of the forefinger; and, lastly, three extensors of the thumb, destined, re- spectively, for its metacarpal bone, its first phalanx, and its second phalanx. Supinator radii brevis, fig. 175, Deep-seated throughout; short and broad ; oblique roimd the upper part of the radius, almost surrounding it in a sort of muscular cylinder. Ex- ternal lateral ligament of the elbow joint, orbicular ligament of the radius, rough spot below the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and adjacent two inches of the outer border of that bone upper part of the radius, ais low down as the insertion of the pronator teres, except the bicipital tuberosity and a narrow surface below it. It is a direct supinator of the radius and hand, and is more powerful, in this re- spect, than the supinator longus; but, as already mentioned, when the fore-arm is flexed, the biceps is the most power- ful supinator muscle. Supinator radii longus, figs. 174, 176, 177, 185, ^o'. Superficial throughout, except that its tendon is crossed by two of the extensors of the thumb ; long, thin, ribbon-shaped, end- ing obliquely, about the middle of the fore-arm, in a fiat tendon ; longitudinal, in the lower part of the outer side of the arm, and along the outer border of the fore-arm. Upper two thirds of the epi-condyloid ridge of the humerus, and external intermuscular septum base of the styloid process of the Fig. 174.—Muscles in front of the radius. Above the elbow, the edges of Fore-arm, complete. ^^.^ ^^.^ ^^^^^^ directed towards the bone and towards the skin, but, in the fore-arm, it turns, so as to become widened out, and flattened upon the subjacent muscles ; its fasciculi

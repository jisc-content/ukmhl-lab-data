INTRODUCTION. 6 tural form than could easily have been obtained from the study of the living types around them, or from the examination of their embalmed and withered dead ; whilst in their lowly relieved sculptures, their intaglj or incised figures, and their flat painted outlines of man, which latter are indeed mere diagram- matic representations, their attention to detailed form became even less noticeable. It would, however, be as little necessary to assume that the execu- tion of these, demanded anatomical learning, as to suppose that such scientific knowledge was possessed by their Semitic and Aryan brethren, the artists of Chaldsea and India, or by those of our own prehistoric ancestry, who carved characteristic and vivid delineations of the horse and reindeer on fragments of bone or horn, by aid of a flint chip, and towards whom we nevertheless may well turn with something like filial respect and regard, as amongst the earliest prosecutors of the graphic art. As to the practice of human anatomy by the Greeks during the time of Pericles, and the actual acquaintance of such artists as Pheidias with human structure, conjecture has been always rife. In the absence of direct proof, it is, by some, maintained that, not even the Greek physicians and surgeons, much less the Greek artists, can be assiuned to have dissected, or assisted at the dissection of, the human body; and it must be admitted that certain departures from strict anatomical accuracy, which are met with here and there in their statues, might seem to strengtlien such an opinion. By some, on the other baud, it has been suggested that Greek artists were not necessarily restricted within the limits which, by law or custom, bound their contem- poraries who practised the healing art; they were certainly wealthy enough and influential enough to have done, unmolested, many things usually for- bidden ; the dead body of a criminal might have been accessible to them, for rude dissection ; and the minuteness of some of their observations on the figure, the exactitude of most of their best work, and the soimdness of their methods of generalisation of form, might seem to justify the belief that they studied, more profoundly than would have been possible on the living model only, the structural details of the human frame. The question at issue must, however, be left undecided, but if, in the Pheidian age, the Greek artists were absolutely precluded from systematic or surreptitious examination of the anatomy of the human body, they certainly dissected animals, and applied the knowledge, so acquired, to the anatomy of man; they, doubtless, availed themselves of the accidents of life and death, which, in peace or war, would afford them transitory glimpses of hmnan structure; and tliey would supplement and test any scraps of inft)rmation thus obtained, and subsequently handed down in sketches on walls or tablets, or by models in their workshops and studios, by the close and intelligent study of the living figure. Herein, indeed, lay their cliief and exceptional means of education ; for the li-ving figure they could constantly observe, at all periods of life, and especially in its noblest

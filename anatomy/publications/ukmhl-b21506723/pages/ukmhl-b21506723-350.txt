Obliquus internus abdominis, figs. 150, 154, Deep, so named, because it is placed deeper than the external oblique, by which it is covered, except at a very minute triangular space, between the margins of the external oblique and the latissimus dorsi muscles, just above the crest of the ilium, fig. 167; fleshy be- hind, at the side, and in front, as far as the outer margin of the rectus muscle, thence tendinous or aponeurotic to the linea alba; the fleshy fasciculi, for the most part oblique, forwards, upwards and inwards, but the lower ones horizontal, and the lowest de- scending obliquely forwards and inwards. Outer half of Pou- part's ligament, ^3, intermediate surface between the two lips of the anterior two thirds of the crest of the iliiun, and lumbar fascia inner end of the pecten, and crest of the pubes, broad anterior aponeurosis of the muscle, from the pelvis to the thorax, and inferior borders of the lower three or four costal cartilages, uniting with the corresponding internal intercostal muscles. Near the outer margin of the rectus, fig. 154, the aponeu- rosis, in its upper three-fourths, splits into two layers, of which the posterior one, unites with the aponeurosis of the transver- FiG. 153.â€”Deep Abdominal Layer; with parts of the Diaphragm. sails, fig. 153, to pass behind the rectus, fig. 154, ^% whilst the anterior one unites with the aponeurosis of the external oblique, and passes in front of the rectus, both uniting beyond it, and ultimately reaching the linea alba, : in the lower fourth, the aponeurosis remains undivided, and, with that of the transversalis, passes altogether in front of the rectus, to the linea alba. At its upper end, the split aponeurosis is connected, deeply, with the xiphoid cartilage and the eighth and seventh costal cartilages, and, super-

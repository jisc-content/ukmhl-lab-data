SURFACE FORMS OF THE LOWER LIMB. 313 the leg, exists between the tibialis anticus and the extensor longus digitorum ; it is convex outwardly, most evident opposite the prominent parts of the muscles, and widens out below into a sort of plane, issuing from which the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis makes its presence felt. Between the extensor longus digitorum and the peroneus tertius in front, and the two larger peronei muscles behind, is another marking, narrow and deep above, as it descends from the depression over the head of the fibula, but soon widening and flattening, as it reaches down, along the 'peroneal furrow, to the triangular surface-form above the external malleolus. Between those peronei and the outer border of the soleus, is another and still plainer and longer intermuscular marking, brought into view by standing on tip-toe, slightly convex anteriorly, and extending from below the head of the fibula, down to the longitudinal hollow between the back of the external malleolus and the tendo Achillis, which is itself lost on the plane surface corresponding with the outer side of the os calcis. Lastly, on the inner side of the leg, between the inner border of the soleus, and the lower exposed portion of the flexor longus digitorum, is another short curved intermuscular marking, running obliquely backwards, and slightly convex anteriorly. The muscular and tendinous forms between these several markings, have been carefully described, and if the descriptions be read, with the living model to refer to, every surface point will be easily recognised. Commencing at the anterior border of the subcutaneous surface of the tibia, or tibial furrow, the fusiform tibialis anticus is seen to be partly let in to the excavated border of that bone and also to project forwards beyond it, so as to fill up its meagre anterior outline, and really to determine the gently convex anterior profile line of the upper portion of the leg; lower down, the tendon of this muscle also partly conceals the bone, and obliterates the nearly right angle between tlie tibia and the astragalus, thus determining the slanting line by which the form of the foot is set so firmly on to that of the leg. The precise places and modes of termination of the fleshy or the tendinous parts of the tibialis anticus, and also of the adjacent extensors and of the two peronei, are plainly visible on the surface, when these muscles are brought respectively into action. The bold swelling, and the high position and abrupt termination, in the leg, of the fleshy portion of the peroneus longus, and the flatness produced lower down by its very long tendon overlying the tendon of tbe peroneus brevis, are often recognisable, especially in standing on tip-toe. The origins of the extensor longus digitorum, peroneus longus, and soleus, surround the head of the fibula, and when in a state of contraction, cause it to appear as a depression. When the soleus is acting, its borders become very plain, as narrow curved prominences, of which the outer one is much the longer, reaching both higher up and lower down, and being, moreover, straighter and narrower, in comparison with the shorter, more oblique and

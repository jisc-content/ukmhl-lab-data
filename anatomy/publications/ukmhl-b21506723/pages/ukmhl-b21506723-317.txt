MUSCLES OF THE THIG of the front of the femur, three inches from its lower end upper part of the capsule of the knee joint. Rectus femoris, 140, 142, 146, ^^ or middle portion of the triceps. Concealed at its origin only, by the sartorius and tensor vaginae femoris, superficial in the rest of its extent; very regularly fusiform, broad in the middle, tapering at either end, and widely penniform; nearly vertical, but slightly inclined inwards, down the middle of the front of the thigh. From the ilium, by two tendons, one, straight and rounded, from the anterior inferior spinous process, the other, flattened and reflected from along a groove over the acetabulum, giving fibres which strengthen the capsule of the hip joint together with the tendons of the two vasti and the crureus into the upper border of the patella. The two tendons of origin soon join at an acute angle, and spread out into a superficial median aponeurosis; from this, the fleshy fasciculi pass sideways and backwards, to end higher up than those of the vasti muscles, upon a deep aponeurosis, which is continuous with the tendon of insertion into the patella, some of the fibres of which tendon pass over the patella to join those of the ligamentum patellae. The common tendon of insertion of the triceps extensor, figs. 139, 140, .passes over the capsule of the knee-joint to reach the top and sides of the patella; it is narrower above than below; its outer border ascends higher up than, but does not reach so low down as the inner one, and, thus, it is shorter, as well as less curved; its upper Fig. 140.â€”Muscles of the Tliigli; front

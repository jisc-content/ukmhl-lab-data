THE MUSCLES. 282 by transverse and oblique fibres, fastened to the tibia, fibula, and os calcis, and embracing the limb, above and below the ankle joint; they serve the important purpose of binding down the long tendons, which pass from the muscles of the leg into the foot, so that these cannot start far away from the bones during the action of the muscles, the direction of Avhich action is here necessarily changed. The anterior annular ligament, figs. 130-132, a a', consists of two bands united by a thinner fascia. The dipper, stronger band is placed vertically in the leg, above the level of the ankle-joint; it contains two sheaths, an inner one for the tendon of the tibialis anticus, and an outer one for the tendons of the long extensor of the toes, and of the peroneus Fig. 131.â€” Muscles and Tendons on the inner border of the Foot, with the Anterior and Internal Annular Ligaments, a, a. tertius, ; the tendon of the extensor of the great toe, '2', passes altogether beneath it. The lower band is placed obliquely across the highest part of the tarsus ; it contains three sheaths, lined by separate synovial membranes; an inner one for the tendon of the tibialis anticus, ; a middle one for that of the extensor of the great toe, ; and an outer one for the tendons of the long extensor of the toes, and of the peroneus tertius, The internal annular ligament, fig. 131, a, is a strong fibrous band, attached, above, to the internal malleolus, and below, to the inner margin of the OS calcis ; it is continuous, on the one hand, with the fascia of the leg, and, on the other, vpith the origin of the abductor of the great toe, and with the plantar fascia. It forms, with the bony grooves on the inner side of the os calcis, three canals lined by synovial membranes, for the transmission, from

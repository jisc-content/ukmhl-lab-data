The part of the metacarpus corre- sponding with the four inner metacarpal bones, is also longer and narrower, in the woman's hand ; the phalanges of the fingers, are likewise longer, in propor- tion to their width, so that the entire hand, when the fingers are straight and Fig. 75.—llie Bones of the Male Hand. Fig. 76.—The Bones of the Female Hand. closely approximated, is, accordingly, not only smaller, but, comparatively, more tapering than the hand of the male. The peculiarities of form, in the female cranium and face, figs. 66,191, depend, not only on the greater smoothness of its surfaces, and the partial sup- pression of the various ridges, eminences, and processes, but also on the relative proportion of its several parts. Taking, as a standard, the cranial and facial forms in the male, the differences observable in the female head, may be said generally to indicate a less amount of departure from the infantile or juvenile characters. In fact, up to a certain period of life, except a difference in size, in favour of the male cranium and face, which, indeed, exists from the moment of birth, and is permanently retained, no distinctly marked sexual differences can be noticed; but these are subsequently established by the evolution of

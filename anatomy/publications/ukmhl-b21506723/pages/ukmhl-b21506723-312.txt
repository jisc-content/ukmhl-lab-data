THE MUSCLES. 292 FtG. 138.—Muscles of the Leg, seen from the inner side. Its action on the bones of the leg and foot, though feeble, must coincide with that of the gastrocnemius; but its connexion above with the posterior ligament of the knee, and below with the fatty tissue at the back of the ankle, may enable it to draw out of the way the capsules of those joints, and the external semilunar cartilage of the former joint, in the rapid flexion and extension of the leg and foot caused by the gastrocnemius and soleus, of which the plantaris is a satellite. Gastrocnemius, figs. 134, 137, 138, 21, 2i«, 21'. Superficial, except small portions of its two heads, above, in the popliteal space; a double headed and double bellied muscle, one of the most beautifully shaped in the body, commencing by two heads emerging at the popliteal space or ham, from between the hamstring muscles, and ending, below, on a broad tendon, which tapers downwards to join that of the soleus, to form the tendo Achillis; vertical at the back of the leg, forming the swelling of the calf (ryaa-T^p, belly, Kv^/j-rj, the leg). Back of the two condyles of the femur, the outer head from a pit on the outer surface of the condyle, above the origin of the popliteus, and from the upper and posterior surface of the condyle, the inner head from an impression on the back of the Internal condyle, and a rough line above it, lower half of the back of the OS calcis, by the tendo Achillis. The tendons of origin of this large complex muscle are short, narrow and flat; the outer one occasionally con-

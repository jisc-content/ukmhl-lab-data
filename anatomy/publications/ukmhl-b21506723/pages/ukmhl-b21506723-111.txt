91 THE MOVEABLE VERTEBRA. to connect it with the under surface of the vertebra above, but, on the contrary, is prolonged upwards, in the form of a very strong toothed-shaped iprocess, named the odontoid, or dentate process (^oBovs, dens; a tooth), the vertebra itself being designated the vertebra dentata. This process ascends into and occupies the anterior part of the ring formed by the first cervical vertebra, which, with the head supported upon it, partially rotates around the odontoid process, so that this latter serves as a pivot or axis of rotation, fig. 36. Hence the second cervical vertebra has been named the axis. The odontoid process presents a contracted part or neck, which is strengthened, in front, by a vertical ridge, and is embraced behind by the so-called transverse Fir. 31, upper view, and FiG. 35, the left side of the atlas.

Fig. 37, upper view, and Fig. 38, the left side of the axis. ligament; its head is club-shaped, having its apex bevelled and its sides roughened, for the attachment of the odontoid ligaments. In front, it has a small oval articular facet, for adaptation to the inner surface of the ring of the first vertebra, and another also oval but somewhat larger, behind, for contact with the transverse ligament just mentioned. The pedicles of the axis are slender, but the lamince of its arch are very thick, and deep from above downwards. The spinous process is also long, deep, massive, rugged, nearly horizontal, but somewhat curved upwards, and deeply bifurcated at its apex;

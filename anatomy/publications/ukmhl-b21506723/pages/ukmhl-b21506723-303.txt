THE MUSCLES OF THE LEG. 283 the back of the leg to the sole of the foot, of the tendon of the tibialis posticus, of that of the long flexor of the toes, and, behind these, and resting partly on the astragalus, of that of the long flexor of the great toe, The external annular ligament, fig. 132, passes from the external malleolus to the outer surface of the os calcis, and encloses in a single synovial sheath the tendons of the peroneus brevis, andperoneuslongus, muscles. The passage of the tendons of the deep flexor muscles of the leg and of the peronei, behind the malleoli into the foot, furnishes good examples of the deflection of muscular force around a bony prominence, so that it no longer acts in the line of the fleshy masses; for, when these muscles act from below upwards, they draw upon the malleoli, and when from above down- wards, they pull/rom them.

Figs. 1'-'" to 132 should be rcfei-red to, whilst studying the Muscles of the Leg. The muscles of the leg may be arranged into an anterior or extensor group, which serves to extend the toes and the protarsus, but beuds the foot upwards at the ankle joint, or raises it towards the leg ; an outer or peroneal group, which flexes the protarsus, but straightens the foot at the ankle ; a deep posterior or flexor group, which flexes the toes and the protarsus, but straightens the foot ; and lastly a superficial posterior group, forming the muscles of the calf, which straighten the foot, at the astragalo-calcaneal and ankle joints.

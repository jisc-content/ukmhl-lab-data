293 THE MUSCLES OF THE LEG. tains a fibro-cartilaginous or bony nodule, whilst a bursa is often found between the inner head and the internal condyle. Each tendon gives off an elegantly shaped aponeurosis 2", slender above, but spreading out below, which covers the hinder surface of the corresponding portion or belly of the muscle, and, as it lies upon the fleshy fibres, somewhat resembles the central spot of a shamrock leaf. The muscular fasciculi from the two short tendons of origin pass obliquely downwards towards each other, and unite upon a tendinous raphe in the middle of the muscle, forming two long rolls of fleshy substance; the fasciculi from the leaf-like aponeurosis pass from the deep surfaces and edges of these, to the hinder aspect of another aponeurosis situated upon the deep or anterior surface of the muscle, and which, emerging from beneath the muscular fibres ^'",and gradually thickening and narrowing downwards, unites at a short distance above the heel, with that of the soleus, to constitute the tendo Achillis The inner head of the gastrocnemius arises higher up, and projects further back, than the outer head ; the inner belly is larger and longer, and its lower end is more pointed, and reaches further down in the calf, than the outer one; the central leaf-like aponeurotic expansion of the inner head, is also wider and thicker than that of the outer one, and the lower obliquely curved border of its muscular belly has a more abrupt profile outline than the corresponding part of the outer head : in these ways, the general symmetry of this richly modelled muscle is varied, and the formality of mere repetition is avoided. The tendo Achillis, figs. 134, 136, 137, 138, named, as is well known, from its occupying the vulnerable part, by which Thetis is said to have held her famous son, when she dipped him in the river Styx, the common tendon of the soleus and gastrocnemius, formed by their super-imposed and blended tendons of insertion, is the thickest and strongest tendon in the body, being more than six inches in length, and nearly three in width at its upper part, though less than an inch wide below. It becomes free from the muscular portion of the gastrocnemius behind, about the middle of the leg, but it receives fleshy bundles from the soleus in front, almost throughout its whole length ; gradually narrowing towards its lower end, it then widens a little as it passes over the upper half of the back of the os calcis, a bvursa intervening, and is finally attached to the lower half of that surface of the bone, chiefly above the inner tuberosity, that is, rather towards the inner than towards the outer border of the heel. As indicated by oblique markings on the surface, the component parts of this large tendon decussate, the deeper or soleus portion passing to the inner border, and the superficial or gastrocnemius portion to the outer border, of the back of the os calcis. The soleus and gastrocnemius, in their free action, extend the entire foot at the ankle joint, and also produce a gliding motion at the astragalo- calcaneal joint, but they have no direct action on the protarsus, like the other

Extensor proprius pollicls, figs. 133, 134, Deep above, super- ficial in its lower half; thin and flat- tened, ending obliquely from behind, on a long and strong tendon ; vertical in the leg, appearing in the lower third, between the tibialis anticus and the long extensor of the toes, then oblique, through and beneath the annular ligament, along the upper surface of the tarsus, the first meta- tarsal bone, and the first phalanx of the great toe. Middle three-fifths of the anterior portion of the inner surface of the fibula, and adjacent part of the interosseous membrane back of the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. Besides extending the great toe, this muscle aids in extending the pro- tarsus, in flexing the foot at the ankle, in raising the foot from the ground in walking, and, when it acts fi"om below, in drawing forwards and sustaining the leg upright, in standing. Extensor longus digitorum, figs, 133, 134, " Superficial; long, flat, semi-penniform, ending obliquely, in the lower third of the leg, on the under and outer side of a broad flat tendon, which first becomes fissured, and then divided into four flat tendons, for the four outer toes ; vertical in the leg, between the anterior tibial and the peroneal muscles, then oblique, beneath the annular ligament, and along the back of the tarsus, meta- tarsus and toes.

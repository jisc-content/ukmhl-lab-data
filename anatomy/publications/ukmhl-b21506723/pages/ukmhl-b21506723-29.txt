9 INTRODUCTION. is impossible not to speculate, in regard to still more remote historic times, and to imagine Egyptian, Greek or Graeco-Roman masters, making more or less rude plans, sketches, or models, of proportion, form and anatomy, it may have been in perishable materials, for their own use and for that of their pupils. Nevertheless, a simple estimate of the facts known to us, may more justly lead to the inference, that whiLt Egyptian art displays chiefly a knowledge of proportion, and Greek art, of proportion and form, modern art has superadded to these, an insight into structure ; so that, in reference to the artistic treatment of the human form, we may recognise in the Egyptian, Greek, and Modern Epoch?, respectively, an anthropometric, an anthropomorphic, and an anthropotomic method. It is easy to perceive that the works of eminent anatomists, though devoted to pure anatomy and not to artistic anatomy, must have been consulted by contemporary and succeeding artists, and thus must have powerfully con- tributed to the dissemination of anatomical knowledge amongst the latter. Moreover, independently of the effects of their published plates and writings, the personal influence of anatomists, whether of the pure or of the artistic class, exercised during intercourse with artists or with others, by criticism, by counsel, or by direct teaching, would aid in an unrecorded manner, in the dis- semination of a more exact anatomical knowledge amongst artists. Lastly, it has often happened that artists and anatomists have combined their efforts towards a common end ; and, indeed, few facts are more interesting in connexion with this subject, than the constantly recurring examples met with, of the warmest personal friendship, as well of the most cordial co- operation between contemporary workers, in the domain common to science and art. Relations of this kind, for example, existed between Delia Toi're and Leonardo da Vinci, Colombo and Michael Angelo Buonarroti, Da Carpi and Benvenuto Cellini, Vesalius and Titian and Calcar, Hamusco and Becerra, Cheselden and Vandergucht, Santorini and Battista Piazzetta, Albinus and Ladmiral, Sommerring and Hock, and between Mascagni and Serantoni. The mutual connexion which has now so long existed between anatomy and the art of design, attests the intimate nature and increasing strength of their relations. It does more; it establishes in the mind, a complete con- viction of their firm and indissoluble alliance. Artists and anatomists, as we have seen, very early united their efforts towards one object; and, whilst the more accurate representative faculty of the former served better to record tlie results attained by the latter, and thus assisted the progress of anatomy, so the arts of design and modelling acquired an accuracy and certainty, not a little due to the fuller investigations and closer criticism of the anatomist. So far as art-anatomy is concerned, the most remarkable and satisfactory works of each epoch, have been those in the production of which, artists and anatomists, of equally great reputation, have bees jointly engaged ; or else

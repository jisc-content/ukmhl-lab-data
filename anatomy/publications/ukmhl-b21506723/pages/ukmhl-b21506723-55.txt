THE BONES OF THE FOOT. 35 outer border of the foot; moreover, it is distinguished by its slanting outer surface, its great breadth at its tarsal end, which rests against the cuboid bone, and also by its remarkable process, named the tuberosity, which projects backwards beyond the cuboid bone, and forms a very important prominence on the outer border of the foot. To this tuberosity, besides the plantar fascia, the tendon of the peroneus brevis is attached; to the dorsal surface of the base of the bone, that of the peroneus tertius; the under side of the base of the bone gives origin to the short flexor of the little toe. The shafts of the five metatarsal bones gradually diminish in size from behind forwards; they are smooth on their opposed surfaces, which give origin to the dorsal interosseous muscles ; from the under and inner surfaces of the third, fourth, and fifth, the plantar interossei arise. They are slightly convex from before backwards, on their dorsal surface, and, on the contrary, slightly concave on their plantar aspect, so that they form the fore-part of the so-called antero-posterior arch of the foot, the hinder portion consisting of the tarsus. The dorsal surfaces of these bones, witli tlie exception of tliat of the first, are turned somewhat outwards; they are, moreover, wider than the under surfaces, which more nearly resemble an edge, so that, the sides of the bones being flattened, their transverse sections are somewhat prismatic or wedge-shaped ; they likewise form a sort of transverse arch, as bound together in the foot. The dorsum and the inner surface of the first metatarsal bone, the former being turned a little inwards, are rounded and smooth, like other bony surfaces which are subcutaneous, or covered only, or chiefly, by skin. The anterior end of the bone, is much expanded, especially in a lateral direction, and terminates in a large, rounded eminence or head, convex in all directions, but much broader than deep, and articulating in front, with the wide deeply concave base of the first phalanx of the great toe. This articular surface is continued further backwards on the plantar than on the dorsal aspect, and there presents two longitudinal grooves, with a sharp intermediate ridge, or a double pulley-like surface, for the reception and play of the two sesamoid bones, which are here articulated with it; lastly, the hinder part, or base of the bone is chiefly expanded in the vertical direction, and is somewhat narrower on the dorsal than on the plantar aspect; it has no lateral articular facet on its outer side, but, at its end, it presents a semi-lnnar, ear-shaped, or kidney-shaped surface, elongated vertically, and slightly concavo-convex, to articulate with an oppositely shaped facet on the anterior surface of the in- ternal cuneiform bone. Hence, like the thumb, its representative in the hand, it does not articulate with the neighbouring bone on its outer side, and has an independent joint at its base. The plane of this joint, as regarded from above, slants a Kttle backwards and inwards, so that the shaft of the bone is directed slightly inwards, away from the second metatarsal bone; viewed D 2

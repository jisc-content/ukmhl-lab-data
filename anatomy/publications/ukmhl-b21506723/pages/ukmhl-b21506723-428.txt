The upper cartUage, like the corre- sponding eyelid, is the larger; this eyelid also is the more moveable one, and is chiefly concerned in opening and shutting the lids. When the eyelids are closed, their relatively thick, flattened edges meet along a transverse curved line, convex downwards, and passing across below the centre of the eyeball, thus more efi'ectually excluding light from the eye. The eyelashes, arranged in two or more rows, reaching further towards the outer than the inner end of each eyelid, and much longer, shorter, and more numerous in the upper eyelid, curve upwards and downwards from each other, fig. 195 ; hence, when the lids are closed, they meet, but do not cross, so as to become entangled as they separate. The skin on the eyelids is very thin, and is always free from fat, which would interfere very much with their movements, especially with their opening. When opened, the elliptical aperture be- tween them is what is commonly spoken of as ' the eye,' considered as a feature of the face, but through which only a small portion of the eyeball is visible.

In this fossa, is a small, pink, moist elevation, called the caruncle (caro, flesh), fig. 196 ; and, between that and the eyeball, is a thin, semi-lunar fold of the conjunctiva, having its free concave edge turned towards the eyeball, and best seen when the eye is directed outwards ; it is the representative of the haw, or nictitating membrane, existing in the horse, and of the third eyelid in certain birds.

The local differences of form, proportion, and direction, in the various parts of the female skeleton, as compared with the male, are very numerous. Tims, in regard to the foot, figs. 67, 68, not only is the bony frame- work smaller in the female than in the male, bone for bone, and, therefore, as a whole, and, not only have the bones, severally, gentler contours and Fig. 67.—Male Foot in outline.

This difference is, moreover, recognisable in each section of the foot, tarsal, metatarsal, and phalangeal. But the elongation of the female foot, is especially noticeable iu the middle and anterior regions, or metatarsal and phalangeal regions taken together ; for they are decidedly longer, in proportion to the tarsus, than in the male foot. Hence, whilst the tarsus is relatively shorter and broader, and, therefore, stronger, and better adapted for bearing weight, in the male.

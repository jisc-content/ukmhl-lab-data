P E E F A C E. I DESIRE to express, on this page, my indebtedness to my friend Mr. J. S. CuTHBERT, for his zealous co-operation, his clear and artistic drawings, and his persistent reference to Nature for every detail of structure and form. The skill and obliging disposition of Messrs. Nicholls also demand my acknowledgments. Lastly, I have to express my obligations to another friend, Mr. John Castaneda, for long-continued and most valued assistance, involving the collation and verification of numerous statements. As to the Anatomical and Physiological data herein set forth, they may be regarded, generally, as familiar to every Anatomist; but for the arrangement and description of those facts, for their exposition and application, and for the introduction of various novel details, as well as for the character of the Illustrations, and the accuracy of the Drawings, I am alone responsible. Owing to the time which I have taken before publishing this work, certain thoughts, scattered through it, have been first com- municated in my Lectures, and have thus been already difiused and made common property, as, indeed, can be testified by many of those, to whom I now, finally, dedicate my labours, namelyâ€” ' To my past, present, and future Pupils in Art Anatomy.'

339 THE MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. LLlDS Latissimus dorsi, figs. 159, 167, *° Superficial, except a small tri- angular part at its upper and inner corner, which is overlapped by the trape- zius ; very broad, flat and triangular, for the most part thin, but thicker along its anterior border ; its lower fleshy fasciculi nearly vertical, its middle ones oblique upwards and outwards, its upper ones horizontal, all r"*^/ converging to the hinder border of the axilla, whence the muscle ascends to the shaft of the humerus. Lower five or six dorsal spines, all the lum- bar, and upper two or three sacral spines, supra-spinous ligament, outer lip of nearly the posterior half of the iliac crest, and lower three or four ribs bottom of the bicipital groove of the humerus, by a short, flat, quadrilateral tendon, blended with that of the teres major. The spinal and pelvic origins of this muscle form a broad, thin, but strong aponeu- rosis, which, wider below than above, is inseparably joined with the aponeurosis of the erector spinse, and gives at- tachment to the fleshy fasciculi, along an oblique curved line passing downwards and out- wards through the lumbar re- gion. The three or four fleshy fasciculi from the ribs, fig. 162, interdigitate with as many of the processes of the external ob- lique, and, ascending together with the fasciculi from the crest of the ilium, form the comparatively thick anterior border of the muscle. The upper horizontal border, which crosses over the lower angle of the scapula, and is sometimes attached to it by a thin slip, is very thin.

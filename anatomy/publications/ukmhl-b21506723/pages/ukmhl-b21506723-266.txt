THE THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. The muscles {/j,vs, a muscle, a mouse), the contractile organs placed between the bones and the skin, constitute the flesh of animals. This flesh, usually of a characteristic reddish colour, varies from a deep red to a pale pink, or is even almost white, as in the lower vertebrate animals, or in particular musclesj in the higlier vertebrata. In man, the flesh is red ; but its colour is paler in early life, and in debilitated persons ; it is darker in the dark races. This contractile substance, or flesh, does not form a homogeneous environment of the bones, but is disposed in separate masses of different size, form, and con- nexions, named Muscles^ fig. 119. These are, moreover, called Voluntary muscles, because they are under the government of the tvill. In the interior of the body, as in the walls of the heart and alimentary canal, other and peculiar muscular structures exist, which, being emancipated from volitional control, are termed Involuntary. A few of the voluntary muscles, such as those of the lips, consist of fleshy substance only ; but, nearly always, this material is combined, in various ways, with a dense white fibrous tissue, arranged in cords, bands, or membranes, constituting the so-called tendons, or aponeuroses. The two structures together form an individual muscle, so that, in defining a muscle, both its tendinous and its fleshy part or parts, are always included. The voluntary muscles and their tendons make up the Muscular System, the study of which is termed Myology. The Structure and ActioiV of the Muscles. ' Every voluntary muscle is composed of few or many parallel bundles of a soft reddish tissue, arranged in diff'erent directions in different muscles, sometimes longitudinally, sometimes obliquely to the axis of the muscle, and sometimes in curved lines, fig. 119. These bundles are named fasciculi, the MUSCLES.

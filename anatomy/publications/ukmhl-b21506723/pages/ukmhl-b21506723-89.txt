The weight of the body, transmitted from above, is supported in the sitting posture on this tuberosity, which, however, as seen from behind, is narrower than the body of the bone. In front of this, the ischium becomes narrow and flattened, and curves forwards, inwards, and upwards, to form the ramus or brcmch of the ischium, sometimes named its ascending ramus, because it is continued upwards to meet and join, by bony Figs. 24, 25.â€”Front and Back views of the Pelvis, showing the Innominate Bones, right and left, the Sacrum and the Coccyx. union, with the descending ramus of the pubic bone, so assisting to form the part of the lower border of the pelvis named the ischio-pubic arch. It here bounds, behind and below, the large aperture in the hip-bone, placed below and in front of the acetabulum, named the foramen ovale, the obturator foramen, or thyroid foramen. The margin of the ramus next to the fora- men, is sharp; whilst that which forms part of the lower border of the pelvis, is thick, uneven and somewhat everted. This aperture, which is completed in

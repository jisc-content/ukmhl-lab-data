All these movements are employed during mastica- tion, providing not merely for the closure of the jaws, but also for the rotation of the lower teeth beneath the upper ones. It is important to note that, in opening the mouth, which occurs not only in eating, but in oratory, in singing, in yawning, and in the expression of certain strong or startling emotions, the condyles, and with them the whole lower jaw, move a little forwards, and yet the chin and the angle are carried backwards ; at the same time, both the body and rami change their direction in regard to neighbouring parts, though not to each other. In closing the mouth, the condyles again move backwards, but the angle and the chin are carried forwards, the rami and body recovering their respective positions in reference to adjacent parts. The backward and forward movements of the jaw are employed in grimacing, and so, in fact, are the side to side motions of the chin, in making ' wry ' faces.

PecL, pectoral. Tr., trapezius. L. levator sca- pulae. D. s., dorsalis scapulae. Br. a., brachialis anticus. Ext. c. r., extensor carpi radialis. Ext. d. s., upper and lower parts of Ext. d. sublimis, of which the greater portion has been removed. Ext. c. u., extensor cai’pi ulnaris. Sup. 1., supinator longus. Sup. hr., supinator brevis. Su^). m., supinator man us. Ext. d. br., extensor digitorum brevis. Fig. 18. Muscles of right forelimb. €., coracoid with {Ep. c. b.) epicoraco-brachialis. B., biceps. H., humerus. G. b. L, coraco- brachialis longus, with divisions to biceps, to ulna, and to condyle of humerus. Pect., pectoral divided and thrown outwards. Br. a., brachialis anticus. Fl.c.r., flexor carpi radialis. Pr.t., pronator teres perforated by the nevye to {FI. d. s.) flexor digitorum sublimis, which has been divided and reflected upwards and downwards. c. w., flexor carpi ulnaris. Fl.d.p., flexor digitorum profundus. Pr. q., pronator quadratus. Pr. m., pronator maiius. R. radius. Fig. 19. Muscles and nerves on palmar aspect of right forearm and hand. FI. d. s., flexor sublimis digitorum divided and reflected upwards to the humerus and towards the ulna and downwards at its attachment to the digits. Fl.d.p., flexor digitorum profundus ra- diating to the digits with the carpal cartilages appearing through it. Pr. m., pronator manus divided and reflected. Pr. t., pronator teres. FI. c. r., flexor carpi radialis. Pr. q., pronator quadratus. P. pha- langeus. U., ulnar nerve and branches. M., median nerve. Fig. 20. Muscles and nerves on the upper part of the head. T., temporal muscle of right side; on the left side the upper part of the muscle has been removed leaving only the part near the inser- tion. M., masseter. On the left side the upper part has been re- moved (exposing the suspensoiium with the dentary nerve in front and the seventh nerve behind); and the lower part has been turned back to shew its insertion into the lower jaw and the dentary nerves passing into the jaw. On the right side a branch of the third division of the fifth is seen emerging from beneath the masseter and joining the seventh, la. Conjoined branch of 7th and 5th—the sub- mental nerve. In the left orbit are seen the ophthalmic nexwe near the inner pai-t of the orbit giving off the ciliary nerve and the supramaxillary, with the optic crossing from the inner side of the orbit over the latter. H., hinder end of the hyoid cornu with {St.) styloid cartilage between it and the jaw. D., dorsal muscle ex- tending to head. Fi«^. 21 represents a piece of the side from which the lateral muscle {L.) has been partly removed to shew one of the spinal nerves emerging from the vertebral foramen just behind the rib {R.) and dividing into anterior or intercostal or ventral (F.) and posterior branches. C. cutaneous nerve from the lattex’. The posterior branches pass in front and behind the ax'ticulating processes to the

90 MUSCLES OF THE SMOOTH DOG-FISH. and penetrate between the lateral muscles the spines are short or abortive; and, on the contrary, when the rays are abortive, the spines run on into the fins. DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES. (PI. VI.) Fig. 28. Dissection of the upper surface of the fore pai’t of the Dog-fish, to show the angular prolongations of the septa of [M. D.) the meclio-dorsal part of the lateral muscle. L. D., the latero-dm*sal part of the same. L. V., the latero-ventral, and Jf. F., the medio- ventral. Zat. d., latissimus dorsi, which has been partly reflected from the fin-muscle. P, pectoral. C. s. s., cervicalis superficialis superior, its supra-branchial portion. D. F., the doi*sal fin. Fig. 29. Dissection of the under surface of the fore part of the Dog-fish. M. V., the medio-ventral portion of the lateral muscle. P, its superficial, or pectoralis, layer advancing to the fin and to {G. S.) the coracoidal septum. G. s. i., the cervicalis superficialis inferior, which, on the left side of the animal, is in situ, but, on the right side, has been reflected to shew (C. pr.) the cervicalis profundus, and the superficial branchial cartilages. The hinder fibres of the cei’vicalis pr. are seen passing upon the fin and connected with the fin-muscle. G. //., the glosso-hyal. G. II., cerato-hyal. B, bran- chiostegal rays. Fig. 30. Side view of a portion of the hinder part of the Dog-fish to show the relation of the dorsal muscle (Gl.) of the ventral fin (F. F.) to (L) the lateral muscle. P. I). F., the posterior dorsal fin. Cl. Cl., the claspers. Fig. 31. Section through the anterior dorsal fin and the body wall. L. S., lateral septum. A, septum between the dorso-lateral muscle and the fin-muscle, passing to the root of one of the cartila- ginous fin-rays, and continued on, as a median septum, to the dorsal spinous process. A', similar septum to the fin-ray above. B, septum from neui'al arch separating D. L., the doi'so-lateral muscle from M. D., the medio-dorsal muscle. C, septum between (V. L.) the ventro- lateral and [M. V.) the medio-ventral muscle. The parts of the vertebra which are ossified ai*e distinguished from the cartilaginous parts by not being dotted. Fig. 32. Section through the post-dorsal (P. d. F.) and the anal {A. F.) fins. V, the ventral muscle behind the part where it is divided into medio-ventral and venti’o-lateral. D, septum between the ventral muscle and the anal fin and fin-muscle. A, septum between the dorsal muscle and the dorsal fin and fin-muscle. Fig. 33. Section through the caudal fin showing the prolongation of the neural and haemal spines into the fin. L. S., lateral septum. N. S. is the divided end of an ovei’hanging neural spine; and II. S. is the divided end of an underlying haemal spine.

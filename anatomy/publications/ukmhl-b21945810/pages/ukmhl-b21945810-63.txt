51 NEiy^ES OF HIND LIMB. neath the pronator quadratus, supplying it, then over the front of the carpus beneath the flexor profundus, where it divides into three nerves, one supplying the muscles of the base of digit II. and perhaps passing on to the radial side of that digit; the second supplying the apposed side of digits ii. and ill., and the third supplying the apposed sides of digits HI. and iv. The second and third nerves last mentioned each receives a twig from the terminal branch of the ulnar w*hich runs across the metacarpal bones and muscles. The ULNAR nerve always arises from the plexus in company with the MEDIAN, and not uncommonly forms one trunk with it, not separating from it till the forearm. In the Cryptobranch the dorsal or posterior part of it shows a tendency to associate itself in its course with the radial or dorsal nerve-trunk of the limb forming the inferior musculo- spiral, which corresponds in mammals to the posterior branch of the ulnar in the fore limb, and to the external saphenous in the hind limb. The palmar or anterior part of the ulnar carries with it the muscular branches usually given off directly from the median; and the trunk of the median is continued on in a deep plane as the ANTERIOR INTEROSSEOUS to the carpus and digits. Nerves to the Hind Limb. The nerves to the hind limb are derived from four spinal nerves (a, h, c, d). Of these the foremost (a) sends a branch to (J) and runs downwards as the obturator nerve, pierces the pectineus where it is taking origin from the interior of the pelvis, traverses the small obturatar hole in the pelvic shield, ! and supplies the adductor muscles arising from that shield, i Whether it extends to the superficial stratum [gracilis, &c.) = there situated, could not be ascertained with certainty. A branch from it however passes backwards to join the branch of ■ the sciatic, which enters the hinder (flexor cruris) part of that I stratum. 4—2

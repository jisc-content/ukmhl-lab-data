56 THE CRYPTOBRANCH. branches of the spinal accessory and of the cervical nerves passing separately into them; and the communicating branches above described between the obturator and sciatic, and between the median, radial, and posterior ulnar at the back of the forearm, indicate that the oflEices performed by the proximal plexuses in ourselves ai*e, to a greater relative extent, performed by distal plexuses or communi- cations in the Crvptobranch. The course which the nerve-curi'ent follows, like that of the blood- current, is, in each case, probably regulated or gi-eatly modified by convenience; and a nerve in its way to a particular muscle takes usually the most direct course, and may attach itself to one set of neiwes or another, according as either lies moi’e across its path. I have already alluded to the difference in rotation of the fore and hind limbs as a cause of difference of distribution of the nerves in the two. The rotation in each limb attains its maximum in ourselves, and causes the divergence of the nerves in the two limbs to be greater than in the Cryptobranch. For examples; the extensors of the leg and of the forearm are both in that animal chiefly supplied by nerves passing behind the respective girdles; in Man the nerves to the ex- tensors of the forearm pass behind the scapula, whereas those to the extensors of the leg pass in front of the pelvis.—In Cryptobranch, the nerves to the muscles on the dorsum of the scapula and to the pectoral pass behind the shoulder, and those to the muscles on the dorsum to the ilium and to the gi’acilis pass behind the hip; in Man the scapula being thrown as well turned more backwards, the nerves (pectoral and suprascapular) to the corresponding muscles in the fore limb pass in front of the shoulder, while those in the hind limb (obturator and gluteal) j)ass behind the hi[).—In Cryptobi'anch the nerves on the palmar and plantar aspects of the two limbs below the elbow and knee present scarcely any difference. In Man the nerves to all the digits of the hind limb proceed together in the posterior tibial nerve as far as the ankle; the companion of the peroneal artery, which is the representative of the ulnar nerve, is a mere muscular branch; whereas, in the fore limb, tlie nerves to the ulnar digits take their course down the forearm in the ulnar nerve quite separate from the nerves to the other digits, which are bound together in what we call the median nerve. These points indicate, as do the variations observed in this and other animals and in man, that nerve-course is somewhat too arbitrary or too much regulated by convenience in each instance for us to be able to rely upon the disposition of nerves as at all sure guides to the discernment, in difficult cases, of the homo- logical relations of muscles and other structures.

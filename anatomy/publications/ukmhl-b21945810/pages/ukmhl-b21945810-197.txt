MUSCLES IN VERTEBRATE ANIMALS. 169 The same upon the fore limb gives rise to the pentorales and the coraco-brachials, including the supra-spinatus on the one side and the subscapular is on the other, together with the biceps. Middle and Distal Segments of the Limbs. The muscles on the ventral (palmar and plantar) and on the dorsal surfaces of these segments of the two limbs are, in each instance, as we learn from the lowest orders of Verte- brates (see Figs. 23, 24, 34 and 36 and Cryptobranch), in their primitive state, in one mass which is connected with, that is to say, is to some extent continuous with, the prolongations of the ventral muscle upon the limb. In animals above Fishes, in all of which a uniform plan of segmentation of the limbs is fol- lowed, each mass (palmar or plantar and dorsal) is usually attached to the bone of the upper segment of the limb and to the several bones of the middle and distal segments. In ac- cordance with the feathering manner in which the limbs, es- pecially in the lower animals, are pressed upon the ground and withdrawn from it, the fibres on the palmar and plantar surfaces are directed from without, inwards as well as downwards, take their origin chiefly from the post-axial (ulnar or fibular) con- dyle and the post-axial side of the limb, and constitute a ‘pronato-flexor’ mass in each limb; while the fibres on the dorsal aspect, having a supinato-extensor action, take a similar direction, passing downwards and inwards from the post-axial side of the limb, and in some instances, in the hind limb, fi’om the dorsal part of the post-axial condyle of the femur. In the case of the fore limb, however, the ulna, rising into the olecranon, commonly shuts off the supinato-extensor mass of muscles from the post-axial condyle of the humerus, and causes it—the deep as well as the superficial layer of it—to spread upon the preaxial condyle and the preaxial edge of the hume- rus. A certain method of division of these masses into planes and sectors is common to them all, and is also common to them in most animals; though there are of course many varieties in detail. A part of either of the masses which associates itself with one plane or one sector in a certain limb or animal may bo otherwise disposed in other cases; but the deviations arc

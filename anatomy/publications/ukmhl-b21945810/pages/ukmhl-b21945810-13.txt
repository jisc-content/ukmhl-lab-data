1 THE MUSCLES AND NERVES OF THE CRYPTOBRANCH. Being so fortunate as to obtain the fine specimen of the great Japanese Salamander v/hich died recently from a gash across its throat in the Zoological Gardens, in Regent’s Park, and having the advantage of my friend and assistant Mr Anningson’s skill for its dissection, I felt that the opportunity of making a more careful examination of the muscles of the animal with I their nerves than had hitherto been done was not to be lost. Hyrtl, in his Cryptobranchus Japonicus, 1865, does not describe either the muscles or the nerves, and Drs F. J. J. Schmidt, ^ Q. J. Goddard, and van der Hoeven {Aanteekeningen over de anatomie van den Gryptohranchus Japonicus, Haarlem, 1862) do not give any account of the spinal nerves. The chief interest in the muscular system of this animal (and the other Urodelans) consists in the massing together of the several muscles, or rather the imperfect segmentation and invidualization of them; so that it affords us, to some extent, a natural means of ascertaining the relationships of the muscles of the higher animals to one another, and so of grouping them. In instituting the comparisons requisite for this, it is difdcult to exercise sufficient caution, and to avoid the errors which the necessities of nomenclature and the straining for over-exactness O of homological interpretation are apt to induce. Especially is .this the case if our views are warped by any theory we are dis- posed to favour. Such influences work upon us imperceptibly; and to be altogether free from them is more than is to be ex- pected, even if it is to be desired. Facts will gravitate from their chaos, and they do so in some minds more quickly, in some in better order than in others; and while we gain the good, we

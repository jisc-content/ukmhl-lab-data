145 MUSCLES IN VERTEBRATE ANIMALS, other limb and in other animals ; and the same with the ven- tral series. There is, moreover, often an antagonistic similarity between the ventral and dorsal muscles, according with the similarity in the action requisite to produce the flexor and the extensor movements. In short, the similarity of muscular disposition about the several joints, in the same or the different limbs of the same or different animals, is, as we might expect, generally proportionate to the similarity of the form, move- ments and position of the joints and of the force required\ Differences in these are sometimes, indeed not unfrequently, associated with such varieties in the combination of embry- onic germs as to defy attempts at an exact homological com- parison. Two important features of difference which serve to modify the muscular relations in the two limbs at once suggest them- selves as being present to a greater or less degree in most animals. First, the superficial position and the mobility of the shoulder-girdle, as compared with the pelvis; and associated with these are the variability and instability of the subglenoid parts of this girdle, and the frequent presence of a clavicle. The shoulder-girdle and its muscles often, indeed commonly, deviate from their simple primitive form and relations much more than do the pelvic girdle and its muscles ; and they are liable to much greater variations in position—fore and aft and in the depth of plane at which they are situated—and in their relation, to the other parts of the osseous skeleton. In one animal the shoulder-girdle is joined to the head, giving it, in the opinion of some anatomists, a claim to be regarded as an appendage to the skull; in another animal it is joined to the vertebral spines; in a third to the vertebral bodies; in a fourth to the sternum ; and in a fifth it is free from all these. These varieties in the girdle involve a greater amount of variety in the muscles connecting it with the rest of the trunk and passing from it to the limb, than is the case with the muscles of the pelvis. There is, however, in connection with the latter, the varying development of the tail, which leads to considerable ^ I do not mean to assert that all muscular varieties are thus teleologically determined; but it is very generally so; and it is not easy to adduce unques- tionable exceptions. 10

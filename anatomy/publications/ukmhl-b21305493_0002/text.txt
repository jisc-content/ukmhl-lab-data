GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. The first part of this work has been devoted to researches on the systems common to the struc- ture of every part, on the primitive systems that form, as it were, the nutritive parenchyma, the basis of every organ, since there is hardly one of these organs in which the arteries, the veins, the exhalants, the absorbents, the nerves, and the cellular tissue do not form a more or less essential part. Each of these organs is woven, first with these parts in common, to which are subsequently added the parts by which they are especially cha- racterized. The systems that will be considered in this vo- lume, are not so generally extended throughout the animal economy. They belong to some pe- culiar processes; thus, the systems of the bones, yol. ii. B* GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. the muscular systems of animal life, the cartila- ginous, and the fibrous, are especially intended for the purpose of locomotion ; thus the serous, mucous, organic, muscular systems, &c. are par- ticularly intended for purposes of digestion, re- spiration, and circulation. Thus, the glandular system forms the secretions; thus, again, the cu- taneous system forms an essential part of the ex- ternal sensitive apparatus, &c. All the systems that remain to be considered, are then much i more isolated, and act a less extended part than those we have been examining. Restricted to particular parts, they do not interfere with the others, they are possessed of a separate vitality, whilst in every part the primitive systems add their mode of vitality to that of every organ they contribute to form. The greatest number enjoy a mode of existence and exterior forms that dis- tinguish them from the latter; the different parts that compose each, are most generally insulated, nor are they connected together. The bones, the muscles of animal and of organic life, the cartilages, the fibro-cartilage, the medullary or- gans, the glands, the serous membranes, hair, &c. display this insulated state in a striking light. Each part belonging to these different systems, is constantly separated from the other parts of the same system, by a number of intermediate organs of a very different nature, and conse- quently belonging to other systems. The cu-general considerations. 3 taneous, fibrous, and mucous systems only, are every where continued in all their parts. And yet, in respect to the last, there is no communi- cation between that part extended over the organs of digestion and respiration, and that belong- ing to the urinary and genital organs. We have found, on the contrary, the primitive systems are every where continuous. The cellu- lar, the arterial, the veinous, the absorbant, the nervous, are so disposed, that if it were possible to remove every organ they overrun, and leave them separate, they would completely represent a whole, differently shaped according to these systems. The exhalants, as we have seen, may also be considered as every where extended. Let us suppose, on the contrary, that the organs inter- mediate to the bones, to cartilages, to the fibro- cartilage, are removed, all the parts of these sys- tems will instantly separate, and continuity will cease to exist. It is of little importance what order we follow in examining these systems; they shall be placed in succession to each other in the following series; that includes, 1st. The osseous system ; 2nd. The medullary; 3d. The cartilaginous; 4th. The fibrous; 5th. The fibro-cartilaginous; 6th. The muscular system of animal life; 7th. The muscu- lar system of organic life; 8th. The mucous sys- tem ; 9th. The serous; 10th. The glandular ; 11th# b 2GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 4 The cutaneous; 12th. The epidermoid; 13th, and finally, The system of the hair. It may be remarked, that nature, in distribut- ing these systems throughout the different organs, has not restricted herself to method ; she pays no regard to the considerable distinctions existing between their respective functions. Each may appertain at the same time to parts for functions that have not the least analogy with each other. Thus, the fibro-cartilaginous, particularly met with in the organs of locpmotion, consequently in animal life enters the process of respiration W through.the trachea; thus, the mucous system, destined in nearly all the parts for the organs of internal life, belongs also to external life in the con- junctivae, in the fossae nasales, &c. to generation in the vesiculse seminales, in the prostrate gland, &c.; thus does the glandular system moisten al- ternately with fluids, the organs, both of ani- mal and organic life, as those of generation. Thus are the serous surfaces extended over parts very distinct from each other by their functions, over the brain and stomach, for instance, over the articulating cartilages, and the lungs, &c. Let us then consider the simple systems by ab- straction, if I may be allowed the expression ; let us represent them to ourselves in an isolated manner, as materials distinct from each other, although united, two by two, three by three, fourGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 5 by four, &c. to form the separate parts of our or- gans, parts from which result the general con- struction of our economy. Each of these is in- tended to perform a determined function, and consequently must be classified in the same man- ner as these functions. It is in this order they are distributed in descriptive anatomy; but simple systems tend only to a common end, inasmuch as they are united, and we cannot, in considering them in a separate manner, be restricted to a classification borrowed from their intended uses*OSSEOUS SYSTEM. % This system, remarkable amongst all others for its hardness and power of resistance, borrows from that twofold property the faculty of serv- ing as a common basis on which other parts rest, and around which they are suspended, as it were, and fixed. The assemblage of the component parts, bound together for that purpose by supple and resisting ligaments, compose a whole termed the skeleton. That bony assemblage, situate amidst the crowd of organs it supports, every where continued in all its parts, is not, however, as the primitive systems, endowed throughout with a similar vitality. The ligaments that con- nect these different parts, very distinct from them both in nature and properties, produce therein a distinct vitality, which does not exist in the dif- ferent parts of the systems above described, be- cause their nature is every where the same.OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 7 ARTICLE I Of the Fyor??is of the Osseous System. Viewed in respect to forms, there are three kinds of bones—the long, the flat, and the short bones. One dimension only predominates in the first, namely, length. Two are observed nearly in an equal proportion, in the second, length and breadth. These two last dimensions, in addition to thickness, characterize the short bones. Let us consider each in a general manner. SECTION i. 'S » . Of the Long Bones. The long bones in general belong to the parts for locomotion, where they form a kind of levers moved by the muscles in various directions. They are all situate within the limbs, where, by their assemblage, they constitute a kind of central and moveable column. On examining them from the superior part to the inferior, from the femur or the humerus down to the phalanges of the toes, or of the fingers, they are seen successively to di- minish in length and increase in number. From , this twofold reverse disposition, it follows, that the superior regions of the limbs are characterized by8 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. extensive motions, and the lower, by the multi- plicity, variety, and restricted limits of these motions. The conformation of all the bones is analogous ; thick and voluminous in their heads, they are thinner and generally round in their middle or body, as it is termed by anatomists. The volume of the heads of the bones affords a double advantage : 1st. To provide for articu- lation, extensive surfaces, and consequently more means of resisting dislocations; 2dly. To contri- bute to the regularity in the form of the limbs to which they belong. It may be remarked indeed, that in the limbs, the muscles and the bones are in juxta-position, but in a reverse sense ; the middle sponds with the middle thinnest, whilst the ends of these make up for the tenuity of tendons in which the others ter- minate, and which are placed near them. The increase of bulk in the heads of bones is not abrupt. It begins gradually from the body of the bone. On these heads different ridges are ob- served, intended either for articulations or points of insertion. The middle or the body has no such projections. Prominent lines only are seen intended for aponeurotic insertions, which, when strongly cha- racterized, divest the bone of its cylindrical form, a form which, however, is continued in the in- of the former, which9 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. terior. Thus the external part of the tibia is evi- dently triangular, although inwardly its canal is of the same form as that of the femur. In general, those lines of insertion always separated from each other by plain surfaces, are three in number in every long bone, as is seen in the hu- merus, ulna, radius, tibia, the fibula, &c. I cannot account for this law of conformation. Another general observation is, that the body of nearly * every long bone is, as it were, twisted on its axis, in such a manner that the direction in the superior does not correspond with that of the inferior part. By following the lines I have just mentioned, from one end to the other, the truth of this remark, which however is more striking in the adult than in the foetus, is very apparent. This change of direction does not follow any general course. The interior forms of the long bones are per- fectly elucidated by sawing these organs in the longitudinal direction : their ends are filled with cellular tissue or cancelli, much thinner and less abundant in the middle where the medullary ca- nal is formed. During the first months of concep- tion, and as long as the bone is in a cartilaginous state, this canal does not exist in the foetus. It is formed during the process of ossification. At this epoch, all the gelatine contained in the mid- dle of the bone is then absorbed. Exhalation does not furnish this organ with any new sub-OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 10 stance, except it be in the spare quantity of cel- lular tissue contained in this canal, and because this function has been suppressed in the centre, it becomes very active round the circumference of the bone. This increase of activity in the exter- nal exhatants, promotes the formation of the com- pact tissue that is developed precisely at the same time as that of the canal, whose parieties it - forms, so that at this period of ossification, ex- halation and absorption seem to be in these two parts of the bone quite in a reverse state; the one very active externally to supply the calcareous phosphates with which the parenchyma already farmed is impregnated ; the other displaying the same activity internally to rob it of the gelatine, which being absorbed, leaves room for the forma- tion of the medullary canal. It is only in the humerus, radius, ulna, the femur, tibia, fibula, and the clavicle, that a regular medullary cavity is formed. The interior of the ribs of the pha- langes, which in form approach tb these, are filled with common cellular tissue, and scarcely ever contain that kind of fine tissue found in the mid- dle of the above mentioned bone, and only to be met with in the medullary canal. This canal does not extend beyond the body of the bone. It disappears where the compact tissue begins to diminish, being replaced by the cancelli that fill the heads of the bone. ItsTorm is cylindri- cal ; its direction straight.. It does not vary itsOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 11 torm in consequence of the projections or pro- minent lines observed on the external surface of the bone, which in these parts only acquire a greater thickness. Its parieties are smoother in the middle than in the ends, from which nume- rous cellular filaments already project. In many subjects it is divided by delicate bony partitions arranged horizontally, which in this part almost completely interrupt continuity, and seem to di- vide this substance into two or three very distinct parts. The medullary canal is not only intended to contain the medullary organ, and to protect it, but also to give a greater degree of resistance to the bone ; for it has been sufficiently proved, that of two cylinders, equal in respect to the quantity of matter they are composed of, but one of which is hollow, consequently of larger diameter than the other which is compact, the former is capable of opposing more resistance than the latter, be- cause it will bend, and is consequently fractured with more difficulty. Compact cylinders, equal in diameter with the long bones, would have pre- vented, by their weight, the motions of the limbs, whilst other cylinders of a similar weight, but unprovided with a cavity, would not have pre- sented a sufficient surface for muscular insertions. The union of lightness, with extent of surface in the long bones, is then an important advantage derived from the existence of the medullary canal. When callus begins to form at the point of frac-12 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. ture this canal is obstructed, because the whole me- dullary organ is impregnated in this part with gela- tine, and becomes cartilaginous ; but that gelatine being gradually absorbed, without being replaced accomplishes the formation of a new cavity, and the former communication between the superior and inferior parts is again opened. I have observed that in the first stage of life, and as long as the bones remain in a cartilaginous state, the medullary canal is proportionally much shorter than in the adult. At birth, it does not occupy more than the middle third of the bone, the two superior and inferior thirds being origi- nally formed by the cartilaginous portion of each end, then by a reticulated substance placed between this part and the canal. As age advances, its length increases. section n. Of the Flat Bones. The flat bones in general are little connected with locomotion, serving only in this respect for the insertion of muscles which from them pro- ceed to the long bones. They are particularly intended by nature to form cavities, such as those of the cranium, of the pelvis, their conformation rendering them very fit for that purpose. 1 hey vary in number according to the cavity they con-OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 13 tribute to form. Several are always united to form a cavity, and it is partly this circumstance that insures the solidity of the parts. In fact the force of exterior blows being expended in their sutures, they are not so easily fractured. If the cranium were composed but of one single piece, it would be more frequently fractured than in its natural state. In proportion as the sutures ossify in old age, the cranium becomes more brittle. In infants, in which ossification is not completed, and consequently the number of isolated bony parts is more numerous in the head, in the pelvis, &c. fractures are not produced without great force, because the soft ties that connect the solid parts, without fracturing, yield to external violence. Almost all the flat bones are curved, concave and convex, in their opposite surfaces, which is owing to their being intended to form cavities, their curvatures varying according to the part of the cavity where they are situate. This curvature is a very powerful cause of resistance, when that above mentioned no longer exists. Thus in the first stage of life, the skull resists fracture by yielding; but in proportion as the sutures become tighter, as it tends to form but one single bony mass, it is the mechanism of the arch that protects the brain. I he flat bones have two surfaces and a circum- ference, the first, accordingly as they are in- tended ^for muscular insertions, or merely co-OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 14 vered with aponeuroses, membranes, &c.,are either rough or smooth. Towards the centre, the bone is thinner, and always thicker in the ridges, which are intended either for articulation or insertion. In the first case, this greater thickness secures the solidity of the joints which is effected by wider surfaces, as in the cranium : in the second, it sup- plies the fibres with a multiplied origin, as may be observed in the crista of the os ilium, and in the greatest part of its circumference. The interior of flat bones discloses but few peculiarities; their two external plates leave a space between them filled with eancelli. SECTION III. Of the Short Bones. The short bones are generally situate in such parts, wherein motion and solidity must be united, as in the vertebral column, the tarsus and the metatarsus; always rather small, they are accu- mulated in a tolerable number in their respective regions : this number in the formation of the parts of the skeleton to which they contribute, com- pensates for their smallness. It is also this num- ber that insures to these parts the possession of the two properties we were just now mentioning, and nearly opposed to each other, namely, solidity, be-15 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. cause the force of the external mechanical shocks are expended in the wide surface by which they are connected, and mobility, because, from their partial motions, there results a very extensive general one. In the external conformation of these bones, there is nothing constant nor uniform; this is modified according to the general plan of the whole of which they form integral parts: thus, the different uses of the carpus, metacarpus of the spine, determine divers forms in their respective bones. The external surfaces of these bones dis- play a number of cavities and projections indis- pensable to their numerous articulations to the in- sertion of the ligamentous bands that connect them together, and to the muscles by which they are moved. In the interior of these bones nothing particu- lar is observed, except a quantity of cancelli of which they are nearly totally composed, and which makes them frequently liable to caries. Let us not suppose, however, that nature has restricted herself to any regularity in dividing these organs, in the long, the flat, and the short bones. Here, as every where else, she baffles our methodical descriptions, and shows us these or- gans, sometimes uniting the character of the long with that of the short bones, at other times the properties of the latter with those of the flat bones. The basillary apophysis and the upper16 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. part of the occipital bone, the body, and the late- ral parts of the sphenoid bones, when compared, prove the assertion. Sometimes, a bone, by its exterior form, belongs to the long, and from its interior organization, ought to be classed with the flat ones. Of this the ribs afford an instance, &c. &c. SECTION IV. Bony Eminences. The bony eminences are generally termed apophyses, they are epiphyses whenever the carti- lage of ossification that unites them to the bone, is not yet impregnated with the calcareous sub- stance. These eminences may be referred to four grand divisions, 1st. Of articulation ; 2nd. Of insertion ; 3d. Of reflexion ; 4th. Of impression. 1st. The eminences of articulation vary accord- ingly as the articulation is moveable or immove- able. To avoid repetition in the chapter on arti- culations, I shall not view them here in a general light. 2nd. The eminences of insertion, are excessively multiplied in bones; they never give origin but by fibrous organs, as the ligaments, tendons, aponeuroses, and the dura mater j every organ dif-OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 17 fering from these in structure, is never implanted in bony eminences and in bones in general, but by means of the above-mentioned organs ; muscles are a striking instance of this. These eminences are in general less character- ized in the female than in the male ; in the infant than in the adult; in weak animals than in such as are carniverous, that live by seizing upon, and destroying their prey. The degree of projection of these eminences for insertion, is always a sure sign of strength, and of energy in the motions. These powers are so much the more developed, as the muscles are the better characterized. Let us only compare the skeleton of a powerful man of a sanguine habit, in whom the muscular system is conspicuous through the integuments, with that of a week phlegmatic subject, whose effeminate forms, like those of a woman, are not outwardly expressed, and we shall perceive the difference. Ihe form of these eminences for insertion vary considerably ; sometimes muscles only are inserted by a number of isolated aponeurotic fibres ; in this case they are small, very numerous, forming as- perities that cover a greater or less surface ; at other times it is from a single tendon the muscle borrows its origin, in which case the apophysis is generally very prominent, and requires but little space. Sometimes a wide aponeurosis gives birth to fleshy fibres ; when it forms a bony line, more or less prominent, that receives the insertion. VOL. If. rOSSEOUS SYSTEM. ] 8 The , eminences are in general proportionate with the muscles to which they give origin : for instance, in three different muscles nearly equal in size, one of which is implanted by insulated fibres, the other by a tendon, the last by an apo- neurosis, it is remarked, that the sum total of asperities for insertions in the first, the insulated apophysis of the second, and the projecting line of the third, are nearly equal to each other in re- spect to the quantity of bony substance of which they are composed ; so that, admitting the apo- physis to be disseminated in asperities, or ex- tended in a line, or again, these asperities to be ac- cumulated in a mass, or that the line is concentrated to form the apophysis, the quantity of bony sub- stance would be found nearly the same. All the advantages derived from the eminences in respect to the insertion of muscles which they remove from the centre of the bone, by lessening the pa- rallelism with the axis, and consequently promot- ing the motions in an evident manner, are easily conceived. » Do they proceed from the contractions of the muscles ? This opinion, borrowed from the laws on the formation of soft and inorganic forms, does not accord with the known phenomena of vitality, with the existence of eminences for in- sertions that are not muscular, and which fre- quently project much more than these, with the disproportion existing between the elongation ofOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 19 peculiar apophyses of muscular implantation, of the styloid, for instance, and the power of the muscles to which they give rise, &c. The eminences for the insertion of ligaments afford the advantage, by removing in some degree the lio-ament from the articulation, of facilitating the motions of the latter. This is particularly re- markable in respect to the lateral ligaments of the elbow, of the knee, &c. In regard to the eminences of insertion, their respective functions will hardly admit of being viewed in a general light. 3d. The eminences of reflexion, are those un- der which, by deviating from its primitive course, a tendon passes. Such is the curve of the ptery- goid apophysis, the malleolar head of the fibula, &c. Nearly all these eminences present in one sense a hollow or excavation, completed in the other sense by a ligament, and thus constitute a ring for the transmission of the tendon. 4th. The eminences of impression it is said, are those that exist where the different organs form depressions that are divided by the emi- nences on the ossified surfaces, which are nothing more than the bone preserving in this part its natural level. The cerebral and muscular impres- sions are produced as instances of this disposition ; but are these impressions actually the result of the compression of the organs on the bone, or do they depend upon the laws of ossification, laws c 220 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. that provide the bones with forms accommodated to the adjacent organs? I should rather adopt the latter of these opinions in preference to the former, which had been thought highly probable, on account of the effect produced by aneurisms on their contiguous bones, which they gradually destroy: but let it be remarked, that if the mus- cles, the brain, the vessels, exercised over the bones in their natural state by their mode of pressure, an action analogous to that of aneurism, the state of the parts should unavoidably be the same as in that case. The compact plate would be destroyed on a level with the depressions, and leave in its place an uneven and rough surface. Now precisely the reverse takes place, which leads me to believe that what is commonly called the impressure of organs, is nothing more than a natural effect of ossification. section y. Of the Bony Cavities. These cavities are innumerable; those alone exterior to the bone, will now come under consi- deration like the eminences ; they are divided into articulating and non articulating. The former will be viewed, together with the correspond- ing eminences, in the chapter on articulations.21 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. Amongst the latter there are cavities; 1st. Of insertion; 2d. Of reception; 3d. Of gliding; 'ith. Of impression ; 5th. Of transmission ; 6th. Of nutrition. 1st. Aponeuroses, muscles, and ligaments, &c. are implanted in the cavities of insertion. They serve, 1st, To multiply fibrous origins with- out an increase of diameter in the bone, since a concave surface evidently presents more ex- tent than a flat one bounded by the same line : 2d. To leave more space for the muscular fibres, and to render them consequently longer than if they arose from a projection, by which means they admit of more extensive motion. The pterygoid and digastric cavities, &c. may be pro- duced as instances. 2d. The cavities of reception are those which are intended to receive an organ to harbour and protect it. Such are the sockets of the bones of the skull, those of the ilium, &c. These cavities sometimes belong to the whole of the bone whose form is concave, as is seen in parietal bones; at other times they are formed in an insulated part, as the maxillary depression of the inferior jaw ; but they are always intended for some essential part, for a gland, a viscus, &c. 3d. The cavities of gliding are generally found in the heads of the long bones : they are furrows, more or less deep, in which the tendons slide to proceed to the intended point of insertion. TheyOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 22 are all lined with a cartilage, and completed by a very strong ligamentous ring. Are these cavi- ties formed by the continual friction of the ten- dons ? It is a general opinion, but no more pro- bable to me than the theory of the muscular and vascular impressions, &c. These cavities should, in this case, be deeper as the muscles are more exercised; they should not exist in subjects para- lytic from infancy, nor in the cartilages of ossifi- cation in the foetus whose limbs undergo but little motion : but the reverse is constantly observed. Let us then consider the different configurations of bones, as naturally resulting from the laws of ossification, laws from which every conformation of the bone originally fixed is merely developed. The volume of the heads of the long bones is fa- vourable to the existence of these different cavi- ties, which, on this account, cannot be detrimental to the solidity of the organ. 4th. The cavities of impression correspond with the eminences of the same description. I have mentioned them before. 5th. The cavities of transmission are espe- cially intended for vessels and nerves. Several are met with in the head ; sometimes they assume the form of a whole, sometimes that of a tube. On other occasions again, that of a slit, according to the width and thickness of the bone which these vessels or nerves have to cross, to proceed from one part to another. The periosteum23 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. lines them. They are filled with more or less cancelli, and the vessels and nerves they transmit do not interfere with the bones. 6th. The cavities of nutrition, on the contrary, give passage to the vessels that convey to the bone and medullary organ the substances that repair their waste. There are three species. Some are exclusively observed in the long bones that are provided with a medullary canal, one only for each bone situate along the body, directed in an oblique line between the fibres of the compact tissue, penetrating sometimes from the upper to the lower part, at other times quite in a reverse sense into the cavity of the bone, and thus establishing for the vessel of the medul- lary organ, a communication from the external to the internal parts. This aperture in fact is especially intended for the nutrition of that organ, and nourishes the bone in an auxiliary manner only. The second species of cavities for nutrition especially belongs to the cancelli of the bones. Thus, where this tissue abounds, it is in the heads of the long bones, on the circumference of the flat, and over the whole superfices of the short bones. They have a more extensive diameter than that of the tube that penetrates the medullary canal, but less so than those of the compact tissue. Their number is very great. I have enumerated as many as one hundred and forty on the tibial24 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. head of the femur, twenty on the body of a dorsal vertebrae, fifty on the os calcis, &c. This number is in general in proportion to the quan- tity of cancelli contained in the bone. This ex- plains why so few are met with in the skull, why they are more multiplied in the bones of the pel- vis, particularly in those parts where this tissue is abundant, as in the os ischium, in the iliac part of the circumference of that bone, &c : on pouring mercury in the spongy tissue, this fluid is found streaming through these holes, and thus displays their communications. Where these apertures exist they are irregularly distributed: none are found on the body of long bones, because they contain no cancelli, or scarcely any. The third species that gives admission to the nutritive organs, is a multiplicity of small pores, evidently perceptible to the eye, through which minute vessels that are lost in this tissue penetrate ; an evident proof they do not reach the cancelli, is, that in the preceding experiment the mer- cury never finds in them an outward issue : their number is past description, in the infant it is very great, gradually as in old age the bones be- come overloaded with the calcareous substance, the apertures are obliterated, and the small ves- sels they contain converted into small ligaments, are no longer concerned with the nutrition of bones that gradually decay, and would end by being completely annihilated, producing necrosis25 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. if general death did not precede this partial death of the osseous system. ARTICLE II. Organization of the System of the Bones. The tissue peculiar to the system of the bones, forms in that system, particularly as age advances, the principal and predominant part. The organs in common are proportionally much less nu- merous. SECTION i. Tissue proper to the Osseous System. The tissue of the bones, like almost every one in the other organs, has a fibrous aspect, the na- ture of which is every where the same, but being differently arranged, admits of two essential mo- difications. In the one, the fibres, more or less distant from each other, display a profusion of cellulee; in the other, closely compressed toge- ther, they form a kind of compact substance, in which they cannot be discerned without the ut- most difficulty. Hence two subdivisions in the tissue of the bones,—the cellular and the com-26 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. pact. Authors have admitted of a third,—the recticular, but it is included in the former. Cellular Tissue. In the first periods of ossification, the cellular portion does not exist. The time of its forma- tion is when the calcareous phosphate is added to the gelatine of the primitive cartilage, and the organ assumes a bony nature. Then the solid mass of the cartilage is divided into innumerable cellulse, because the gelatine being taken up by the absorbents, has left the parts it previously occupied. It is no longer replaced by the exhal- ants that still circulate some, and which begin to convey the calcareous phosphates to the fibres, from the interweaving of which these cellulse proceed ; so that the developement of the can- celli is visibly owing to the disproportion arising in bones, at a certain epoch of their increase, be- tween the functions of the exhalants and absorb- ents, hitherto equally maintained. The cause of this disproportion is not ascertained; it appears to be a law of ossification ; it is in virtue of this law, and by a similar mechanism, that the ethmoid bone, solid at first, and full as long as its original cartilage, is filled with numerous cellulse, at the epoch of its ossification. Thus it is the sphenoid and frontal sinuses originate and are extended.27 OSSEOUS SYSTEM* The formation of cancelli is completed when every epiphysis has disappeared. At this period, it displays an infinity of fibres that seem to arise from the internal surface of the compact tissue, projecting in every direction, crossing each other, uniting together, separating, dividing, and assuming in fact such irregular di- rections, that it is impossible to follow them in their course. Their volume is no less variable, such is at times their excessive tenuity, that they are ruptured by the slightest contact; at other times, their thickness is tolerably striking. In- stead of fibres, lamellae, varying in their extent, are often found, from which smaller lamellae seem to ramify, arise, and from which there results whenever they are very close, a kind of ducts, easily perceived on sawing transversely the end of a long bone, to obtain a segment of half an inch. The cellulae formed by their partitions are re- markably irregular, both in form and in capa- city. They all communicate, as is proved by the fol- lowing experiments. 1st. If the end of a long bone, the surface of a flat or of a short bone, be perforated, and mercury poured in, it crosses all the communications to flow through the various natural passages on the surface of the bone, which of themselves open into the cellulae. 2nd. If a bone be sawed at one of the ends, and plastered28 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. all over its surface so as to stop the apertures, then exposed to the sun, the medullary juice pre- vented from transuding through the external pores will, after crossing the cellule©, flow from the divided part. 3dly. By varnishing a dried bone, and opening it in two opposite parts, air, water, and every kind of fluid, after crossing these communications, will flow through both aper- tures. We may then conceive the interior of every bone as forming a general cavity, filled with a number of intersecting fibres. I have observed no material difference in the direction of these fibres in the three species of bones. Compact Tissue. It is not the same with the fibres of the compact tissue, as with those of the preceding; these fibres in juxta-position leave no spaces between them, giving by their tight adherence, a remarkable density to the tissue they form, in a longitudinal direction; in long bones divergent, and radiating in the flat; they intersect each other in every di- rection in the short bones. This threefold dispo- sition of the fibres in the compact tissue, seems completely to proceed from the mode of ossifica- tion. In fact, if its progress be studied in the pri- mitive cartilages, these organs are seen to impreg- nate themselves with calcareous phosphates, inOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 29 that direction which the fibres will subsequently assume. Thus are these fibres very apparent in the early age, particularly in the bones of the skull. In proportion as the calcareous phosphate successively accumulated in the cartilaginous pa- renchyma predominates, every thing in the com- pact tissue seems confounded in one homogeneous mass. But, even then, various circumstances seem to point to the direction of the primitive fibres : 1st. Whenever by the means of acids the bone has been deprived of its calcareous substance, the cartilaginous parts retain, as a kind of mould, the form of the substances by which it was filled, and display fibres, whose directions are the same as those described in the three species of bones. Thus, if the laceration of the cartilaginous la- * mellee be then attempted, they are more readily separated in this direction; 2d. The clefts that occur in bones long exposed to the air generally follow the natural direction of the fibrf; 3d. The calcination of bones displays nearly the same phenomenon. The direction of fibres in the compact tissue is completely changed in the apophysis, where it does not follow that of the principal bone; in those which in form partake of the character of long bones, as in the styloid process, these fibres are longitudinal; they assume every direction in those, which like the mastoid, the different speciesOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 30 of condyles, &c., may, by their conformation, be assimilated to the short ones. The assemblage of fibres has been considered, by anatomists, as forming lamellae in juxta- position as it were ; united by processes according to some ; by the intersection of the fibres by others. These bony lamellae do not appear to me to exist in nature ; all the fibres of the outward shell ad- here together, cross each other, and constitute a whole that can not be conceived in this manner, which, besides, does not correspond with the irre- gular distribution of the vessels. Here, art has divided the fibres into layers, in the same manner as in a tendon, a ligament, &c.; but all this is nothing but fiction. To represent the bones as the result of their union, would be conveying a very incorrect idea of the structure of these organs; and it would be still more erroneous to consider these lamellae as adhering together by attraction, by means of bony points, by a kind of glutinous matter, as a substitute for glue. All such ideas, contradicted by anatomical inspection, suggested by a wrong application of the laws of adhesion of inorganic forms, to the adhesion of organized fibres in the present day, belong only to the his- tory of physiological errors. There is a circum- stance it is said, that evidently proves the lamel- lated structure of the bone ; it is exfoliation. It is true, that frequently very distinct lamellae are31 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. separated from the living bone ; but these are nothing more than the produce of exfoliation itself; then, in fact, the surface of the bone dies ; the superficial vessels are no longer supplied with blood; the fluid is checked in the part deprived of life; there, also, the exhalation of the calca- reous phosphates finds its limits, every species of vascular exhalant or absorbant organ is destroyed ; a chronic inflammation, attended^ with suppura- tion, ensues, and draws the line, and as this line is frequently drawn on the very same level, all that lays above is converted into an inorganic layer that gradually exfoliates and retains the solidity of the bone, because the absorbents being impaired, could not rob it of the calcareous substance. Be- sides nothing is more common than to find ex- foliation is not affected in the lamellae, and the bone to display subsequently an uneven surface produced by the irregular thickness of the exfo- liated parts. Finally, exfoliation frequently takes place in quite a reverse sense to what these lamel- lae are supposed to assume: this is seen by the separation of the parts in the heads of the long bones that have remained exposed to the air, or been so much irritated by amputation, by the fall of horns, &c. Let us then consider the compact tissue as an assemblage of united fibres, but not arranged in distinct layers, that can only be con- ceived abstractedlv. •/ In their organic arrangement, the fibres of the32 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. compact tissue differ from those of the muscles, in- asmuch as they are united together by frequent prolongations, whilst these are hardly possessed of any other means of union than the cellular organ, the vessels and nerves. Such is the inti- mate position of these fibres, that their inter- spaces are not discernible without the assistance of the glass, and which are filled with the medul- lary juice, and that of the vessels. In cases of rickets this identity is destroyed, and in the mid- dle of the long bones, under the increased layer of the periosteum, an ossified tissue of a circu- lar form, easily bent in every direction, display- ing an infinity of cellulse, and a substitute to the outward shell that should have existed, is observed. It appears that the change of this com- pact tissue is less the effect of absorption of a part of the calcareous phosphate, than of the extension of the bony fibres that separate from each other, and leave between them spaces that did not previously exist, giving to the long bone affected with this disease a very considerable thickness. I have repeatedly made this obser- vation. Disposition of the Two Bony Tissues, viewed in the Three Species of Bones. These tissues studied in the different species of bones are differently arranged. In general theOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 33 SwtH-C* ;<' v compact tissue forms the external part and lines the bone, whilst the cancelli occupy the interior. The nasal process only is an exception to this rule, whose modifications we shall now consider. 1st. In the long' bones the compact tissue is particularly remarkable for its thickness in the centre, where it is intended for a threefold use; first, to protect effectually the medullary organ it jhae3, then to insure the solidity of the bone in this part, to which much more than to the ends every powerful effort of locomotion, of falls, of counter strokes, &c. is directed, and wherein the bone crossed by a few very weak cellular fibres only, can borrow no power of resistance from its external parieties. Finally, to reduce the volume of the middle part of the bone without endanger- ing the limb, whose form is thereby, as we have seen, rendered much more regular. In pro- portion as we recede from the centre of a long bone sawed in a longitudinal direction, the outward shell is observed to decrease in thick- ness, and to be gradually reduced in the end to a thin plate similar to that of the short bones; thus the resisting power in long bones consists less in their compact structure,, than in the profuse quan- QU / ^ tity of cancelli crowded within ; it is this parti- ^ cularly that prevents fractures, from whence it is seen how the proportion between the compact and spongy tissues being in a reverse sense in the L' u VOL. if. DOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 34 two parts of bone, their mode of resistance must also be equally opposite. Viewed in the medullary canal, or in the ends, the cancelli are somewhat different. In the tube it consists of very small filaments, continued with thicker fibres that fill up both ends of the bone, and with the compact part that forms the bony cylinder, very scarce and disseminated as it were accidentally in the middle of the canal, these filaments approach nearer together, and form a kind of net-work, as they recede from the centre ; hence the denomination of reticulated substances. This, however, is not a distinct tissue, it is no more than a modification in the cancelli, a modifica- tion especially characterized ; 1st, By the tenuity of the fibres; 2d, By being deficient of those short and delicate lamellae that are frequently developed in that tissue when viewed in the other parts. Besides, the evident use of this portion of cancelli, too weak to contribute to the resistance of the bone, is evidently to afford a support for the medullary system, and a means of origin to its membrane. The fibres of the cancelli gradu- ally increase in thickness in the ends of the long bones, they approximate more, are strewed with lamellae, and by their number and union, give to the bone a remarkable thickness and power of resistance, without, however, increasing the weight, a circumstance favourable to locomotion,35 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. since that weight placed at the further end of the lever, would have been too much to be easily lifted. 2d. The compact tissue in flat bones form two external plates of a moderate thickness, between the middle and ends of the long bones, or to that of the short bones. Between these two plates is the cellular texture, generally similar to that in the ends of long bones, a little more flattened, how- ever, commonly thicker towards the ridges or the circumference, frequently wanting in the mid- dle of the bone, where the two compact plates, in close juxta-position, when placed against the light, are transparent. In general, whenever flat bones by the deficiency of cancelli are thin, very powerful muscles meet and compensate by their thick layers for the want of solidity in the bone, as the iliac fossae, the sub-scapulary, the inferior occipital, &c. afford instances of. 3d. The cellular structure always predomi- natesTn the short bones; they are almost entirely formed by it, being merely covered with a slight layer of the compact tissue, and in this respect their organization is similar to that of the heads of the long bones : thus the resistance of the bone de- pends upon the whole,and one part is not more ex- erted than another to prevent fracture. From what has hitherto been stated, the successive mode of solidity in the different bones has been sufficiently elucidated: in the middle of the long bones it is d 2OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 36 almost exclusively the compact tissue; in the flat, partly this and partly the cellular tissue, or cancelli, that constitute solidity ; in the ends of long bones, and in the short ones, it is almost ex- clusively to the latter tissue that this property is owing. 4th. In the eminences of the bones, the com- pact tissue is in general more abundant than in other parts, particularly in those of insertion, as in the projecting lines of long bones that entirely formed with it, in the asperities of bony surfaces, and in their angles. If the emi- nence be considerable, more or less cancelli con- tribute to the formation, as is seen in the spinal, the transverse, vertebral, coracoid, mastoid, apo- physes, &c. The eminences for the moveable articulations are in general more sparingly sup- plied with compact tissue, the articulating cartilage being a substitute to it, for the solidity of the bone : on the contrary, those of the immoveable articulations being in general smaller, such for instance; as the indentations of the bones of the skull, &c. are proportionally more compact than cellular. 5th. In the cavities of the bones, every one of those that are intended for moveable articulations, are provided with a very thin compact layer only : with a thicker whenever the articulations are characterized by want of motion. In general every aperture, cavity, or tube, that transmitsOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 37 vessels, nerves, and other organs, from one region to another, is lined throughout with a compact layer that protects them from the impression of those parts. The foramina at the basis of the skull, the sockets of the teeth, of the vidian nerves, &c. are instances of this disposition. Of the Composition of the Bony Tissue. Whatever maybe the modifications under which it is represented, this tissue is everywhere of the same nature ; it is formed of the same elements, and these elements are especially a saline, calca- reous, and a gelatinous substance. In bones, the existence of the first, is proved in different ways: 1st, Combustion, by destroying the gelatinous parts, leaves a friable, brittle sub stance,of a similar form with that of the bone, which is nothing else than this saline substance, resem- bling, as it were, a moulded form that retains the shape after the mould has been removed. If combustion be carried too far, and the calcined bone become red, it will undergo a semi-fusion similar to that of porcelain; then it assumes a light fine texture, half vitrified, semi-transparent, and that aspect, in short, that characterizes vitri- fied earthy substances ; 2d. The exposure of a bone to atmospheric air, when continued for a considerable time, will produce nearly a similar38 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. effect to that of the first degree of combustion, although, however, it is seldom in this case com- pletely deprived of its gelatinous parts, and the saline so effectually laid bare, as by the action of caloric ; besides, to produce this effect, a consi- derable time is required, particularly with the thick bones, the thin bones require less. In an observation I have repeatedly made, I remarked that clavicles which had remained in the ceme- tery of Clamart for ten years exposed to air and rain, presented, when submitted to the action of acids, a cartilaginous parenchyma nearly equal to that of a bone that had undergone desiccation for some time. But finally, this parenchyma decays, and the bone no longer supported, moulders into dust, when, in the course of time, the particles of the remaining calcareous substance have been dis- united. 3d. In every cancerous disease that has attained its last period, the bones acquire a degree of brittleness proceeding only from a greater proportion of the latter substance, a proportion that itself proceeds from but little gelatine being then exhaled in the bones; 4t.h. When a bone has been for some time submitted to the action of an acid, of the nitric for instance, it is robbed of a part of its substance by that acid, and that part is evidently a calcareous salt, as is seen by mixing an alkali with the dissolution, which instantly, uniting with the acid, discovers that salt in a pre- cipitated sediment; 5th, Papine’s machine also,39 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. by dissolving by the gelatine the action of water reduced to steam, evidently produces that cal- careous saline part. Scheele found that this portion was a neutral salt, with an earthy basis, the phosphate of lime. Phosphorus, when exposed on a fresh and naked bone, gives it a luminous appearance, visible dur- ing night, at a considerable distance. Sometimes it is the whole bone, at other times a part only, that is luminous. I have always observed in the luminous part, an oily exudation, proceeding either from the medullary juice, or the fat of the parts that surrounded the bone. Various facts, not less evident than the pre- ceding, prove, with equal certainty, the existence of a gelatinous substance in bones; 1st. When in their dissolution by the agency of acids they have been deprived of their phosphates, there re- mains a cartilaginous body, flexible, elastic, yel- low when the nitric acid has been made use of, bearing the same form as the bone. Now it is well known that it is the gelatine which chiefly forms the cartilages; 2dly. If, besides, this carti- laginous residue be submitted to ebullition, a great quantity of gelatine will be extracted, it dissolves in water, and may be subsequently pre- cipitated by tan. The bones may even be" de- prived of this substance without a preliminary extraction of the calcareous phosphate. Thus it is, that with bones deprived of every sur-OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 40 rounding organ, reduced to very small fragments, or even to powder by the rasp, very nourishing broth and substantial jellies can be made. It is not without reason, that the bone is left in boiled meats; besides the white organs that surround it, and the medullary oil it contains, it imparts to the liquid a substance peculiar to itself. 3dly. The combustion of bones, and particularly of their cartilaginous residue, has exactly the same smell as that produced by the combustion of every ani- mal glue, which, as is well known, are especially composed of gelatine. 4thly. In the different affec- tions that soften the bones,, the earthy substance is evidently more or less diminished, and the ge- latine remains proportionally more abundant than before. These two substances, the gelatine and the saline, that are the essential component parts of bones, give to these organs very distinct charac- ters. The calcareous phosphate nearly uncon- nected with life, is merely intended to provide the bones with the degree of solidity and resis- tance that characterize them. The gelatinous substance, on the contrary, has especially the characteristic of animal matter; thus is animal activity, as we shall see in a reverse sense with the one, and in a direct one with the other. When deprived of the second, bones will no longer admit of being digested, the gastric fluids will not act upon them, they cannot ex-41 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. tract any nutritive matter from them, because they merely act upon them in the same manner as water, that separates the gelatinous from the saline substance. Different animals, that feed by swallowing fresh bones, would starve surrounded by calcined bones. Thus, the more a bone con- tains of that substance, the more nourishing it is; those of young animals are, in this respect, the fitter for broth, and the better digested raw by peculiar animals, &c. If a bone be submitted to the action of an acid, and afterwards softened in boiling water, it becomes digestible food. Besides the above mentioned substances, the bones also contain a few saline principles, such as the sulphate and carbonate of soda, &c. but in such small quantities, that it is not worth while to consider them here. On this head, I shall refer to books on chemistry, particularly to the import- ant work of Fourcroy. SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Osseous System. The ancients had ranked the bones amongst the white organs, amongst tendons, cartilages, &c.; kut it is only necessary to examine their interior,OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 42 to observe by the red hue that distinguishes them, that much blood is admitted. This blood is con- veyed by three different orders of vessels: some belong to the medullary canal, some to the can- celli, and the others to the compact tissue, or out- ward shell. The two last orders, distributed in the bony tissue, seem chiefly intended to provide it with the calcareous substance, for in respect to the cartilages of ossification, it is the white vessels only that convey the gelatine; it is the same thing with the other cartilages, which leads me i to think that this species of vessel is also intended in the perfect bones, for the nutrition of their cartilaginous parenchyma, whilst the blood ves- sels more directly belong to their calcareous part. Each medullary cavity is provided with one vessel only, and one aperture for nutrition. The diameter of this Vessel is proportionate with the organ which it penetrates without leaving any ramusculae in the compact tissue, and where it instantly divides into two branches. These pro- ceed in reverse directions to the two ends of the bones ramifying to infinity in the medullary organ, and losing their last ramifications when the cancelli begin, wherein they anastomose with the vessels of that tissue ; this situate in the me- dullary cavity, under the denomination of re- ticulated, and the internal surface of the compactOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 43 tissue, also receive a few branches. A vein every where attends the artery, and follows its various distributions. The vessels of the second order belong to the cancelli of the long and short bones, they are in an equal number with the apertures of that tissue, ramify over the cellulae, and communicate with the marrow and the compact tissue. At the mo- ment of death, the small arteries generally re- main filled with red blood, which points out their course, and which, by their excessive tenuity would otherwise be inscrutable, being but very imper- fectly demonstrated by injections. The veins that accompany these arteries can hardly be seen. The blood vessels of the third order are nothing more than the ramifications of the arteries that surround the bones, ramifications that crowd in the compact tissue, and are lost in it. The ex- istence of these minute branches may be eluci- dated in various ways. 1st. By lifting the dura- mater from the internal surface of the scull, a profusion of small bloody drops point out the laceration. £dly. By removing the periosteum of a middle aged subject, a similar phenomenon is produced. I have noticed that these experiments are particularly successful in drowned subjects, in animals purposely suffocated, on account of the great quantity of blood their vessels contain. 3dly. If a long bone be fractured in the middle, the compact part that forms the medullary tube,44 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. presents small reddish striae, that are nothing more than these small vessels still filled with blood, a more or less considerable number is thus ascertained, in proportion to the blood contained in the capillary system at the moment of death : 4th. The sawing of the compact tissue in living animals is tinged with red, less so, however, than that of the cancelli; a proof that a number of vessels have been injured by the saw. The vessels of the bones are uncommonly nu- merous in infants. Their number decreases in the adult and it is very much reduced on the decline of life. The facility that attends the formation of callus, follows the same proportion in the diffe- rent stages; sometimes, and even frequently, in the affections of the osseous parenchyma, they acquire a remarkable developement, such even as considerably to exceed the natural diameter. The osteo-sarcoma, and the spina-ventosa, display this disposition, which is more frequently observed to be the result of cancerous than of any other tumours. All these vessels communicate by multi- plied anastomoses: this is particularly observable in the long bones, between those of the medullary or- gan and those of the cancelli. By these communica- tions they act as substitutes to each other for their functions. In a body I was injecting, I found the nutritive foramen of the tibia completely ob- literated ; a kind of cartilage filled up the space, the artery being nothing more than a real liga-45 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. ment. Its bifurcation, however, in the medullary canal, was perfectly injected, and no deficiency besides in the nutrition of the medullary tube, which had probably received the same quantity of blood as usual, could be observed. I could see nothing near to the aperture that could ac- count for this obliteration, an exostosis, an affec- tion of the periosteum, or an inflammation, might readily have produced it. On the other hand, it is sufficiently known that very considerable lamellae are frequently exfo- liated by caries from the heads of the long bones, in consequence of which every vessel correspond- ing to these lamellae is destroyed, and that the bone is alive under that part, and is nourished by the blood it receives from the extremities of the artery of the medullary organ. This is also al- most what takes place in the long bones during the early stages of life, when the ends of the cartilages are unprovided with vessels of the se- cond order, and that consequently nearly the whole vascular supply proceeds from the same ar- tery of the medullary organ. On this account it . is proportionally much larger, as well as the fo- ramen intended to receive it. Nothing has hitherto been proved in respect to the system of the absorbant and exhalant organs of the bones ; and our reasonings on this head are guided by analogy only ; however, the nutritive function evidently implies their existence.46 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. In regard to their cellular tissue, it appears almost completely different: it might even be said, that in whatever part the compact fibres or those of the cancelli are ruptured, the fila- ments are never distinct; it is their tight and dense tissue that conceals them from us. In fact, 1st. Whenever that texture softens, and the bone becomes fleshy, as it is vulgarly termed, the cellular tissue is very apparent. 2dly. Gran- ulations formed over the fractured parts, or over those laid bare, are nothing more than an extension of the cellular tissue, overloaded with calcareous substance, that in the natural state concealed them from sight. 3dly. After having deprived a fresh bone of all this substance, by means of an acid, I have sometimes discerned the cellular filaments, by separating the cartilagi- nous fibres that constitute the remaining paren- chyma. 4thly. When to extract from it the gelatine, this cartilaginous parenchyma is submit- ted to ebullition, parts of membranes are left, that are evidentlv cellular. •/ The nerves cannot be traced in bones, such is the tenuity of the filaments that penetrate these organs. I am not aware that anatomy has any thing positive in this respect.47 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Osseous System. SECTION i. Physical Properties. The bones are possessed of physical properties in an eminent degree. Solidity and hardness are their peculiar attributes,—a twofold advantage derived from the calcareous phosphate with which they are impregnated. This substance gradually increases as we advance in age. Elas- ticity is another of these properties combined with the preceding, but in a reverse order ; as it resides in the gelatinous substance, and in the cartilaginous part of these organs, it is more strik- ing as we approach the period of infancy. In the aged subject, the bone is completely deprived both of its suppleness and elasticity; it is more frequently fractured. Elasticity is more striking in the long and thin bones than in those of greater volume. The fibula will bend, and re-assume its primitive state; the tibia will also bend, but with more difficulty. This does not proceed from the one being more elastic than the other, but from • . * its organization being better accommodated to the exercise of this property.48 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. SECTION II. Properties of the Tissue. Although hardness and solidity appear to be opposed to every kind of extension and contrac- tion in the system of the bones, yet these two phenomena are frequently very apparent; and the properties of the tissue from which they pro- ceed are very striking. The extensibility of the bony fibres is suffi- ciently proved by the observations made in nume- rous diseases; for instance, in the spina-ventosa, in the swelling in the maxilliary sinus, when affected with a polypus, in the expan^ons of the bones of the skull, from hydrocephalus, &c. Jn respect to these various distensions, I have remarked, that frequently, from the influence of similar causes, the bones that in the above mentioned cases yield and distend, are fractured, worn away, and destroyed in others. A polypus perforates the naso-palatine partition, without any previous distension ; aneurism of the aorta does not bend the sternum forward, nor does it force the verte- bras to yield ; it perforates and destroys these bones. The cause of this difference in effects, in- fluenced nearly by similar causes, is not easily determined. The contractility of the tissue,49 OSSEOUS SYSTEM, when the cause that distended the fibres has been removed, is very evident in bones. The alveolar socket, when the tooth is drawn, is seen to contract, and even to become obliterated. The reduction in thickness of the jaw, after the teeth have appeared, proceeds merely from the con- traction of its fibres, which are no longer so much distended by these bodies, because the root has not the same thickness as the crown, which before was completely contained within the jaw-bone. The maxillary sinus contracts when the fungus has been removed, or an issue given to the pus of the carious tooth, &c. &c. If death were not, in cases of hydrocephalus, too immediate a result of puncturing the head, I am convinced the bones would gradually contract to their natural state, and the cavity of the skull re-assume its usual di- mensions. When, in cases of necrosis, the dead part of a long bone has been removed, the new bone outwardly formed by the periosteum evi- dently contracts. In atrophy of the optic nerve, the foramen of that nerve becomes evidently smaller; in the same manner, the cavity of the orbit contracts, after the extirpation of a can- cerous eye. After having tied one of the carotids of a dog, I dissected the canal of that vessel: no contraction ensued, because the blood proceeding from the anastomosis dilated the artery as usual. This contraction in bones, proceeding from the VOL. II. £50 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. contractility oi the tissue, is not so readily per- formed as that in muscles, in the skin, &c. when they cease to be distended f>y a tumour, a collec- tion of serum, &c. This proceeds from the dif- ference of the organic tissue, from the rigidity of the bony fibres, caused by the calcareous sub- stance with which they are loaded. On this account, organic sensibility is not so evident in these organs. section nr. Vital Properties. In their natural state, bones are almost entirely deprived of animal properties; they do not pos- sess sensibility ; the saw, the mallet, or the chisel may be applied with impunity to their tissue,— a dull sensation being the only result; even fire will destroy it without causing much pain. In a state of disease, however, the sensibility is very acute; the excruciating pains attending the spina-ventosa, and those not less acute, the ef- fect of caries, &c. in some cases, are sufficiently known. If a bone undergo inflammation, as in the extremities of an amputated stump, for instance, which in the natural state had sustained the action of the saw, without transmitting any painful sensation, it becomes, as it were, a new sensitive organ, in which the least con-OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 51 tact is attended with pain. Animal contrac- tility does not exist in this system. This, like every other system, is animated by the organic properties, and this kind of sensibility is very evident; bones feel the fluids they con- tain, and appropriate to themselves in virtue of that sensation, those accommodated to their nutri- tion. But do they re-act upon these fluids ? Are they calculated to perform those insensible osci- lations that constitute insensible organic contrac- tility ?—their state of hardness does not seem to admit of it. Within these organs there is a con- tinual alteration, an habitual composition and decomposition, that can hardly be conceived, without admitting of re-action on their part; on account of their structure, however, this re-action is performed more slowly, and with greater diffi- culty. Hence, undoubtedly, proceeds the degree of torpor, that will afterwards be noticed in the vital phenomena of this system. It is completely unconnected with sensible organic contractility. Characters of the Vital Properties. The vitality peculiar to bones consists only of organic sensibility and insensible organic con- tractility : from these two properties every vital phenomenon observed in these organs is derived ; inflammations, the formation of tumours, the cica- trization of their fractures, &c. This peculiar life e 252 OSSEOUS SKSTEM. is, as T have just observed, remarkable amongst those that distinguish the other organs, for its % torpor, and the slow developement of its phe- nomena. Every thing in respect to age, to the different proportions of earthy and cartila- ginous substances being similar, inflammation is slower in its progress than in any other part. The formation of callus is more tedious than in other cicatrices : if we only compare an exostosis in its origin and progress with the formation of a tumour in the soft parts, with phlegmon for in- stance, the difference is striking. Who is not aware, that whilst in the other organs the process of suppuration frequently requires only a few days, in bones several months are necessary ? Let us observe the difference between gangrene of the soft parts, in which case death takes place after a very short interval, with caries and necrosis of bones, which require a long period for their com- pletion. It may be said on this account, that when seated in the bone, inflammation is chronic. Sympathies. This character of the vital properties imparts a similar one to the sympathetic connections of the osseous system with those of the other systems. First, animal contractility, and sensible organic contractility, could not be brought to act in these connections, since they do not exist in53 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. bones. Animal sensibility being but slowly and imperfectly developed by the diseases that essen- tially affect these organs, the sympathies have much less influence. These sympathies then, must essentially affect the organic sensibility and insen- sible organic contractility ; and as these two pro- perties are but very slowly developed, it follows that the different sympathies must be perfectly unconnected with the acute affections of the other organs : it is what observation evidently proves. In fact, if we only observe, that whilst the other systems readily sympathise with the acute affec- tions of another organ, this organ, as well as the cartilaginous and fibro-cartilaginous systems, &c., in almost every case remain inactive. If the stomach, the lungs, the brain, &c., be the seat of some serious and acute disease, a variety of sym- pathetic phenomena are produced in the nervous, vascular, muscular, glandular, cutaneous, and mucous systems, &c. &c.: all seem to partake of the mischief in the affected organ. Each, in pro- portion to the degree of its vital powers, displays a variety of phenomena that are nothing more than aberrations, irregular developements of these powers. In the muscular system of animal life, the animal contractility is especially increased ; hence spasms and convulsions : in the glandular, serous, cutaneous, mucous systems, &c., it is the insensible organic contractility, and organic sen- sibility, that* undergo the greatest alteration ;54 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. hence proceed the various and sympathetic affec- tions of secretion, perspiration, and exhalation. In the nervous system the animal sensibility is sympathetically excited ; hence proceed the dull and fixed pains in different parts. In the organic muscular system, it is the organic contractility that is augmented ; hence the irregular motions of the heart, of tlfe stomach, and the intestines. Two orders of sympathies constantly attend the acute affections of every organ, some relating to the affected organ, as cough, pains in the side, expec- toration of blood, the difficulty attending respira- tion, &c., in peripneumony,; others merely sym- pathetic, and proceeding from the connections between the vitality of that organ with those of every other: now the latter are frequently much more numerous than the former. Let us only consider the bones amidst the ge- neral sympathetics affecting the systems in which vitality is very active; they undergo no altera- tion : their vitality, slower in its progress than that of the other systems, cannot admit of the phenomena that bear an acute type. It is the same in respect to cartilage, fibro-cartilage, hair, aponeurosis, &c.; all of these systems are remark- able for a similar character of vitality, but do not correspond with the acute affections of the other systems : they are not acted upon during these affections, at least in any striking degree. II we regard the acute fevers, we find that their innu-55 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. merable phenomena will only act upon the sys- tems in which vitality is very active: all those possessing a character the reverse of this, always remain unconnected with these phenomena, they continue, as it were, calm and unmoved in the o-eneral disorder that affects the others. Let us, for instance, select the different eruptions that appear during fever; they affect the skin, the mucous surface, &c. : with the fever they arise, and with it they decline ; hut the bones, the car- tilages, &c. from their peculiar mode of vitality, could not admit of such rapid origin and fall. It is in slow and chronic affections then, that instances of sympathies in the systems of bones and cartilages, &e. should be sought for. In the early periods of the invasion of the venereal dis- ease, when it appears with acute symptoms, at least when its progress is not very slow, as in buboes, inflammation of the urethra, &c. its in- fluence does not re-act upon the system of the bones, it is only after it has continued some time, after it has degenerated as it were, and assumed chronic type, that bones are affected by the dis- ease, and become the seat of pain, of different tumours, &c.; besides, I am not aware that the sympathies of the bones have been properly ana- lyzed. I have merely given a sketch of their ge- neral character ; they will be much better ap- preciated, when the connection existing in dis- eases between the affection of each organ, and56 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. its mode of vitality, has been properly investi- gated. Seat of the Vital Properties. Impregnated wifh saline substance incessantly tending to obey the laws of affinity and attraction, and to give to these laws a predominance over those of sensibility and organic motion, the bones appear to form the intermediate link between living and inert bodies. There is but one part of their bony tissue that partakes of the vital phe- nomena, namely, their cartilaginous substance; the other part, or the calcareous substance, has no connection with it. Thus the degree of vitality in bones, is in proportion to the quantity of these substances. During infancy when the former predominates, and in the early periods of the formation of callus, when it is exclusively met with, in the softening of bones, in which case it exists almost separately, all the vital phenomena become more striking, more energetic. On the contrary, as the saline substance is gradually ac- cumulated in the bones by age, or in proportion as in peculiar species of animals, this accumu- lation takes place in consequence of the natural laws of ossification in respect to peculiar external parts of the system that have a calcareous basis, as the horns of the stag, the crustaceous cover- ings, &c. life is, as it were, progressively de-57 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. stroyed in the osseous system, and is ultimately completely annihilated whenever the calcareous part predominates very considerably: this is ex- actly the case when, in consequence of necrosis, the horns and the crustaceous coverings, &c. fall. We may also ascertain the exact degree of vita- lity an organ is possessed of, by the rapidity with which the different stages of inflammation suc- ceed each other, and the frequency of this affec- tion in that organ. Now, inflammations in bones are more rapid in proportion to the quantity of cartilaginous substance which the affected organ contains. Let us remark the different periods of the healing of bones at the different ages, periods measured by the length of inflammation indispen- sable for the formation of callus; we shall find them shorter and more frequent in the infant, and much longer in the aged subject, and that fre- quently they will not consolidate, whilst it is ef- fected with the utmost facility in all soft parts. The general decay of the vital powers from age is, without doubt, one cause of the slowness or rapidity with which callus forms at the two most distant stages of life ; but the different pro- portions of the gelatinous and calcareous sub- stances have also a considerable influence : for, let other cicatrizations be compared with these, the cutaneous for instance, the difference, esta-OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 58 blished by age, in respect to that rapidity or slow progress in the re-union of the parts, is much less than in the system of the bones ; they no longer possess sufficient vitality to inflame and unite, but the skm and the muscles still display that phenomenon in a very striking degree. In an aged subject I have seen the neck of the femur fractured, that had remained for a considerable space of time without uniting, whilst a wound in the face of the same subject was rapidly healed by the first intention. Finally, the following is a very simple experi- ment which I have frequently repeated, and which, like the preceding facts, prove that the animal part of the bone is in the cartilage. It is well known that one of the essential properties of ani- mated forms, is to contract and shrink in burn- ing : now, as long as the bone remains impreg- nated with the earthy salt, it will not admit of this mode of combustion, but if deprived of this substance by an acid, the remaining cartilaginous parenchyma will contract and twist during ignition. The flat bone of the infant in which this parenchyma predominates, displays the same phenomenon ; combustion compels the calcareous portion, which is in small quantity, to follow the impulse it gives to the organ, to bend in a variety of directions; but in the adult, in whom this earthy substance predominates, the bone remains59 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. immoveable whilst penetrated by fire, and is completely robbed of its cartilage, without the fibres being able to yield to their tendency to contraction. ARTICLE IV. Articulation of the Osseous System. All the bones are united together, their assem- blage forming the skeleton ; their mode of union varies; but whatever this may be, it is expressed by the general name of articulation. section 1. Division of the Articulations. All articulations are referred to two general classes. Mobility is the distinctive character of the one, immobility of the other. The one belongs to every bone intended for locomotion, to a few of those intended for inter- nal functions, such as the ribs, the lower jaw, &c.; the other is especially met with in bones, the as- semblage of which form the cavities intended to protect the organs, as is seen in the head, the pelvis, &c.60 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. Moveable Articulations—Considerations respecting their Motions. j I divide the moveable articulations into four kinds, the characters of which are borrowed from the different motions they perform. To form a proper idea of this division, it is requisite that the articulating motions in general should be first known. They may be subdivided into four spe- cies, namely, 1st. Opposition. 2dly. Circum- duction. Sdly, Rotation. 4thly. Gliding. 1st. The motion of opposition is that performed in two opposite directions; for instance, from flexion to extension,—from adduction to abduc- tion, and thus reciprocally. This motion is ge- neral or limited. It is general when performed in every direction, as above stated, then in those they include ; limited, when there are only flexion and extension, adduction and abduction, &c. The femur, in its articulation, is possessed of a general motion of opposition ; the tibia, in its articulation performs a limited motion of opposition. <2dly. Circumduction is the motion by which the bone describes a kind of cone, the summit ot which is in the superior articulation, the basis in the inferior one ; so that this organ is successively a state of flexion, of adduction, of extension, and of abduction, according to the motion by which it began, and describes also every other motion61 OSSEOUS SVSTEM. included between these. From this we perceive, that circumduction is a motion that comprehends all those of opposition, and in which the bone, instead of proceeding from one part to the oppo- site one, as in the preceding case, moves from one point to the next, the end describing a circle, which is the basis of the cone I have mentioned, and the more extended as the bone itself is longer. It is easily conceived, that in this sys- tem, such bones only as are characterized by a vague motion of opposition, are calculated for circumduction. 3dly. Rotation is quite different from the pre- ceding motion. In the first locomotion is in- cluded in the progress of the bone from one part to another; here the organ remains in the same situation ; it only turns on its axis. The humerus and the femur enjoy this mode, which is deno- minated simple motion. 4thly. Gliding is within the attributes of every articulation. It is a dull motion, by which two surfaces meet in a reverse direction, by gliding, as it were, the one over the other. This motion is included in all the others, but frequently exists alone. From such notions in respect to articulating motions, the division of the class of moveable articulations into processes is easily conceived. In fact, there are articulations that include every motion; others are deprived of rotation; in62 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. several, rotation and circumduction are wanting, and opposition exists in one sense only ; some are singly possessed of no rotation : finally, some are not calculated to perform rotation, circumduction, and opposition, but merely intended for gliding. From this it is seen, that nature here, as well as elsewhere, is gradual in her progress; that from the most moveable articulations to those the least so, there are several degrees of diffe- rence ; that she gradually proceeds to the immove- able articulations, wherein there is merely a glid- ing motion, such as that observed in the carpus, in the tarsus, &c. Another intermediate articu- lation might be included between the latter spe- cies of motion and complete immobility; it is that of the symphysis pubis, which, with that of the humerus, ma.y be considered as forming the two most distant orders in the series of moveable arti- culations. Every individual articulation I have just been mentioning, displays contiguous surfaces. It is the general character of those intended for mo- tion. This rule, however, admits of an excep- tion ; it is the articulation of the bodies of the vertebrae, in which continuity and mobility are united. The symphysis pubis is also partly con- tinuous in its surfaces, and sometimes performs obscure motions. Hence proceeds a division of the moveable articulations, into those with conti- nuous and those with contiguous surfaces.G3 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. Immoveable Articulations. The immoveable articulations sometimes pre- sent indented surfaces, as those of the bones of the cranium, in which numerous asperities are locked together; on other occasions, surfaces in juxta-position, as in the articulation of the tem- poral with the parietal bones, of the two superior maxillary bones with each other ; and again, im - planted surfaces, as in the teeth. All these divisions will be easily conceived, by referring to the following table, which is not the same as that produced in my treatise of the mem- branes. I am induced to believe this presents rather a more useful classification, inasmuch as it displays the two essential points in every kind of moveable articulation; namely, 1st. The connec- tions between the articulating surfaces that charac- terize the orders. 2dly. The number of motions of each, that distinguish the genera. In the im- moveable articulations these are merely orders ; for excepting the surfaces, they do not present sufficient difference to admit of a subdivision.OSSEOUS SYSTEM.

After having thus divided the articulations, let us produce, in respect to each class, a few general considerations; but let us previously observe that the preceding table, considered in respect to the moveable articulations, with contiguous sur- faces, clearly shews how very much these articu- lations are liable to luxations, which are more frequent in proportion as the motions are more extensive. The first genus is the more liable to this accident; the second the least so; the others.65 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. more or less, as they are nearer or more distant from these, in the order above stated. Considerations respecting the Moveable Articulations. This class of articulations is the more import- ant to consider, because their mechanism is the most complicated of the two orders that com- pose it. The last, or that of articulations with continued surfaces, we shall in these general con- siderations pass unnoticed, since it contains one single species of motion only,—that of the verte- brae,—which motion will be considered in exam- ining the spine. The order of the moveable articulations with contiguous surfaces, includes, as we have said, five genera, characterized by their respective motions. First Genus. General opposition, circumduction, and rota- tion, characterize this genus; the first, by the extent and multiplicity of the motions: that of the humerus and scapula, the femur and bones of the pelvis are instances of it; they even exclu- sively compose this genus. We may conceive why nature has fixed this VOL. If. - p66 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. kind of articulation in the upper part of the limbs, —atwo-fold advantage resulting from this disposi- tion : on the one hand, very distant from that part of the limb most directly endangered by external mechanical injury, it more readily escapes luxa- tion, to which it is exposed by its want of soli- dity ; on the other hand, it is calculated by this disposition, to impart motion to the whole limb, compensating for its deficiency in the inferior articulations, in which solidity excludes motion in every direction. For instance, the two articula- tions just mentioned are not only intended for the humerus and the femur, but also for the whole limb, which they move in various directions. Thus it is that anchylosis in this part renders the limb totally useless, whilst in the inferior articu- lations it only destroys partial motions. The peculiar motion of this kind of articula- tion necessarily implies a semi-spherical form in its articulating surfaces, concave if they receive, convex if they are inserted. This form, in fact, is the only one calculated for the united motions of general opposition, rotation, and circumduc- tion : it is actually the form of the superior parts of the humerus, with the shoulder bone ; of that of the femur, with the os innominatum. The bone that moves is possessed of the convex surface, the other of the concave one. Some species of animals present quite a reverse disposition: I67 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. mean, that a concavity is seen to move in every direction, on a convex surface ; but in man this disposition does not exist. Although in respect to motion, the two limbs have the utmost analogy with each other, there are some few distinctions relating parti- cularly to their respective uses; which are, in the one, to grasp at or repulse external bodies, in the other, to perform locomotion. The most essential of these distinctions is, that rotation and circumduction take place in a reverse sense, in these articulations. The mechanical cause, and the advantages of this disposition, are easily felt. In the femur, the length of the neck that acts as the lever for rotation, admits of very exten- sive motions, which make up for the want of pronation and supination in the leg, so that in every rotation of the foot there is a motion of the whole limb. In the humerus, on the contrary, the neck being very short, tends to concentrate the motion to the axis of the bone, and limits rota- tion, which can more readily be dispensed with, on account of that of the fore-arm ; the motion of the hand inward and outward, then, is never performed but by a part of the limb. In respect to circumduction, or circular motion, the length of the neck of the femur is an obstacle to it. In fact, we must observe that this motion • » is in general more easily performed, as it is exe- cuted by a rectilinear lever, because then the f 2OSSEOUS SYSTEM. G8 axis of the motion is also the axis of the lever ; that, on the contrary, if they describe an angle the motion is much more difficult, because its axis is not that of the lever ; and in general, it may be said that the difficulty of the motion is in proportion to the distance between these two axis. This once determined, let us observe that the axis of the motion for circumduction in the femur is evidently a straight line, directed ob- liquely from the head down to the condyles, and consequently removed above from the axis of the bone, by the whole extent of the neck. Now, from what has been stated, it is evident that the difficulty attending circumduction is in a direct sense with the length of the neck, and con- sequently rather considerable. In the humerus, on the contrary, the neck being very short, the axis of the bone is nearly confounded with that of the motion : hence the facility and extent of circumduction. By this proportion, the connec- tions of these motions might strictly be ascer- tained ; the circumduction of the humerus is, to that of the femur, what the length of the neck of the former is to that of the neck of the latter, which shows how much more difficult is the cir- cumduction of the femur than that of the hume- rus. To ascertain this, it is sufficient to know how far the length of the neck of the one exceeds that of the other.OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 69 The advantages derived from the great exten- sion which the circumduction of the superior limbs, intended for seizing external bodies, and from that motion, limited by nature in the infe- rior limbs intended for a stationary position arid locomotion only, are easily felt. Why the former are more easily luxated than the latter, is also easily understood. In fact, in one of the simple motions, a succession of which constitutes the compound motion of circumduction ; for instance, in elevation and depression, in adduction and ab- duction, &c. displacement most generally takes place, and all these motions being much more extended in the humerus than in the femur, the surfaces are more readily separated. Second Genus. The motion of rotation being wanting in this genus, it differs from the first. Opposition and circumduction only are met with. Instances of it are aseen in the temporo-maxillary articulations, in the sterno-clavicular, radio-carpal, metacarpo- phalangean, and in the carpo-metacarpal of the thumb, &c. The deficiency of rotation evidently implies, fiom what has been said, the absence of a bony head, whose axis should form, as in the preceding genus, an angle with the axis of the body of the one. Thus in every bone of the articulations to70 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. which I have just alluded, the articulating sur- face is situate at the very end of the bone, and not sideways ; the axis is the same for both, and they form a rectilineal lever instead of an an- gular one. These articulating surfaces, in general, are like the preceding, uniform, destitute of reciprocal prominences and depressions, which would ob- struct and even completely prevent circumduc- tion. In the supporting bone it is a concavity more or less deep; in the moveable bone, it is an analogous convexity. The corresponding sur- faces of the temporal and inferior maxillary bones, those of the metacarpus, and the first phalanges, &c. afford instances of this dispo- sition. This mode of articulation is most favourable for circumduction, which is, as we have seen, al- ways in a reverse sense to the rotation, and which constantly affords the greatest possible fa- cility when the lever is rectilinear, a circum- stance by which rotation is annihilated : how- ever, in many articulations of this kind, circum- duction is evidently more restricted than in the humerus and in the femur ; but this proceeds from the moving powers, which being much more numerous in these two long bones, compensate for the disadvantageous disposition, by the circum- duction of the articulating surfaces. In the articulations we are now considering,71 OSSEOUS SYSTEM* motion is always performed more readily in one direction than in the others ; for instance, in the elevation and depression of the jaw, the flexion and extension of the first phalanges, of the wrist, &c.: there are in general two lateral ligaments and a capsule where the motions are the most re- stricted ; a capsule only, where they are more ex- tended. Third Genus. In proportion as we advance in examining the modes of articulation, we find the extent of mo- tion is lessened. In this there is less opposition in different directions, and of circumduction, which always implies an undefined opposition. Here this opposition is constantly limited to one direc- tion, to that of flexion and extension for in- stance. This kind of articulation is peculiar to the mid- dle of the limbs, as the elbow, the knee, towards the middle of the fingers in the articulations of the phalanges. Although the bones which compose them below only move in one direction, yet they borrow general motions from the superior articu- lation of the limb, and by that means may be va- riously directed. The articulating surfaces are found here, as in the preceding genus, situate at the extremity of the bone, having the axis in common with thatOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 72 organ: but these articulations differ; 1st. Inas- much as they have several prominences and cavi- ties that are inserted into each other, a disposition which, by limiting the motion to one direction only, prevents it in every other. In general there are two kinds of semi-spherical projections? called condyles, that move from before back- wards, or from within outwards, &c. on two simi- lar cavities, and that are divided by a projection which is inserted in the interstice between the condyles, as is proved in the femoro-tibial articulations, in those of the phalanges, &c.; 2dly. This genus is also distinguished from the preceding, by the width of the surfaces: this width secures its solidity, and prevents luxations, which, however, are attended with more dreadful consequences in these parts, as a greater number of ligaments must necessarily be torn. In this genus, motion is always more extended in one direction, than in that which is opposite. In general, flexion is never so limited as exten- sion : in fact, if we consider the condyles of the femur, of the phalanges, &c., they are much less extensive in the one than in the other direction; Why is this ? because all our essential motions require flexion, and those of extension are only intended to enable the former, as it were, to re- store the limb to a position from which it may proceed to be again bent. This explains why the numbers and the powers of the fibres are73 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. much more considerable in the extensors, than in the flexors; why the large vascular and nervous trunks are constantly placed on the side in which flexion is performed, as is seen in the thigh, in the leg, in the fore arm, and in the phalanges, &c. There is always something or other that limits the motion of extension, as the olecranon in the hu- mero-cubital articulation, the cross ligaments in the femoro-tibial articulation, &c. Although there are no characteristic motions of circumduction in the genera we are now con- sidering, yet, when the leg or the fore arm are in a state of flexion, they are able to move laterally, and even to describe the cone, but in a very slight degree only. During extension, this is utterly impossible, because the lateral ligaments being stretched, they will not yield sufficiently to suffer the bone to move from one side to the other. Fourth Genus. Opposition or circumduction of any descrip- tion, are wanting in this genus, that contains nothing more than rotation, as those of the ulna and radius, as the atlas and occiput afford instances of. Sometimes there is a concave surface re- volving over a convex one, as in the lower part of the radius, and in the odontoid apophysis; at other times, there is a convex surface, moving in a con-7,4 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. cave one, as the upper head of the radius: there is always a kind of ligament that completes the concave surface, and forms a ring, revolving over the bone, or on which the bone turns. Luxations here are not very frequent, because rotation being performed on the very axis of the bone, the ligaments are scarcely more distended on one side, than on the other, and consequently, are not so easily fractured, let the extent of the motion be what it may. The inferior part of the radius, might rather be considered as an excep- tion to this rule, because it is on the ulna, and not precisely its axis, that the bone in this part turns. In the leg, the motion of rotation, as we have noticed, is not the same as that of the fore arm ; that of the femur, which is considerably extended, compensates for this ; but in respect to the humerus and fore arm, the case is different, as is proved by the anchylosis of these parts. Fifth Genus. %■ This genus is totally deprived of every kind of rotation, of opposition, and of circumduction. It includes the articulations of the carpus, meta- carpus, tarsus, metatarsus, of the vertebrae, in re- spect to their articulating apophyses, of the atlas with the occiput, of the humeral ends, of the75 OSS LOUS SYSTEM. clavicle anterior ends of the ribs, and upper end of the fibula. There is but one sort of gliding, more or less obscure, and in which the bony sur- faces are rarely separated ; almost every one of these surfaces are plain, very tightly compressed together, united by innumerable ligaments, and so effectually supported in their connections, that they can hardly ever admit of luxation. Another cause also prevents these accidents, it is that nearly the whole of these articulations belong to the short bones: now, it is sufficiently known, that the motion imparted to a bone has a power of action, that is in a direct sense with its length, and in a reverse one with its smallness; for in- stance, the same power applied to the tibial end of the femur will much sooner cause the luxation of its ischiatic end, than if applied to the middle of that bone. As the isolated motion of every individual articulation of the fifth genus is excessively re- stricted, nature generally accumulates several in the same part, to produce a sensible general mo- tion, as in the carpus, the tarsus, in the ver- tebrae, &c.: this is an additional cause for the scarcity of luxations in these kinds of articula- tions. In fact, let the general motions be ever so violent, two bones separately taken, perform but very little motion in respect to each other, and it is only the extent of motion in isolated bones, that can produce displacement.76 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. SECTION III. Considerations on the Immoveable Articulations. In this class, we have been restricted to orders, because its varieties are not sufficiently extended to be subdivided into genera. 1st. The order of immoveable articulations with surfaces in juxta-position, is met with in such parts, as those where the single mechanism of the part nearly suffices to insure the solidity of the bones, that are merely situate next to each other, without being bound by the least insertion, and are only separated by an interposed small layer of cartilage. Thus the maxillary bones that are in- serted between the cheek bones, the os unguis, the ethmoidal, the palatine, the vomer, the coronal, &c. are supported more by the general mecha- nism of the face than by the articulating ties that connect them together: thus the squamous portion of the temporal bone supports the parietal more by the mechanical powers of its angles, than by the mode of union of their respective surfaces. Deprive the parts of this general mechanism, and they instantly separate. 2d. The order of immoveable articulations, with inserted surfaces, is also partly indebted for its solidity to the general structure of the region ;77 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. but that mechanism would not be sufficient to in-» sure solidity : thus the bones, instead of presenting plain surfaces, are indented with dove-tailed like projections that are inserted into each other, as is seen in the parietal bones with each other, and with the sphenoid, the occipital, the coronal, &c. This is what is termed suture. This order of articula- tions sometimes approaches the preceding, as in the parietal or the coronal sutures, which reciprocally pressing upon each other, are more supported by this mechanism than by their own indentations, and in other parts are better connected with the fol- lowing order, as in the parieto-occipital order, in which very deep indentations only secure the so- lidity of the union. This order is never met with but in the ridges of flat bones; the indentations of these ridges, by multiplying the points of con- tact, compensate for their deficiency of surface; the projections and notches that compose the indentation, are always found irregular both in form and size. They are exactly framed on each other, bearing not the least resemblance in two bones of the same species, and proceeding from two different subjects; so that the left parietal bone of one individual could never be united with the right taken from another. Much has heen said of the formation of sutures; they aie a separate effect of the laws of ossification, laws we can no more account for than for anyOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 78 other, no more than for the general phenomena of growth. This order of articulations gradually diminishes with age, and the bones are united by the ossification of the slight interposed cartilage. The preceding order less frequently disappears. In very elderly subjects, however, 1 have found different articulations of this kind that were im- perceptible, especially those of the maxillary bones with each other. 3d. The articulations, with implanted sur- faces, do not borrow their solidity from the me- chanism of the part; they are entirely indebted for it to the connections of the surfaces that are so united and woven together, that displacement cannot take place. There is but one instance of this articulation; we find it in the tooth with the jaw-bone. Here age does not erase the articulation, and does not, on this account, confound together the two bones as in the preceding orders, because the means of union consists in the palatine membrane that belongs to the mucous system, and which, from that organization, never has any tendency to ossification ; whilst, in the preceding cases, the interposed cartilage has a natural propensity to impregnate itself with calcareous phosphate.79 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. SECTION IV. Of the Means of Union in the Articulating Surfaces. The articulating- surfaces would soon be parted , if different organs did not retain them together. These organs are the cartilages and the mem- branes for immoveable articulations, the liga- ments and muscles for the others. Union of the Immoveable Articulations. The two first orders of the immoveable articu- lations—those with inserted surfaces, and those with surfaces in juxta-position, are provided with cartilages interposed between the bony surfaces, so much the thicker and wider as we are nearer to infancy. Nearly all the bones of the head are held together in this manner, which allows them to yield in some degree to the mechanical efforts they may be exposed to, and which consequently prevents their being fractured. In the articulations of the pelvis there are ligaments as well as cartilages, but as these articulations perform in some cases, slight mo- tions of gliding, they may be considered as an intermediate class between the moveable and im- *80 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. moveable articulations. It is on this account they are possessed of the two species of organs espe- cially intended to secure the articulating surfaces of each of these classes, namely, the cartilages and the ligaments. The immoveable articulations with implanted surfaces, an order exclusively composed by the teeth, have no other uniting agent between their surfaces, than a mucous membrane, the palatine. This explains why, by the congestions, of this membrane, by scorbutic affections, and by the use of mercury, &c. the teeth are loosened, &c. TJnion of the Moveable Articulations. The moveable articulations, with contiguous surfaces, are especially united by the ligaments met with in the five genera, but under different forms, that will subsequently be examined. In this species of articulation a considerable degree of suppleness is added to a very powerful resistance, a twofold attribute it borrows from its peculiar tex- ture, and which renders it very proper for this func- tion. Let us remark, however, that these two pro- perties are in a reverse sense in the two most dis- tant stages of life ; that suppleness is the property of infancy, and that stiffness and resistance cha- racterize the ligaments in the aged subject; hence partly proceeds the multiplicity of motions in theOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 81 early age, and the slowness and difficulty that at- tend them in the latter. Cartilages are not, in this order of articulations, as in the preceding, intended for the purpose of union, but by their smooth and polished surfaces for that of motion. In respect to the synovial membrane exclu- sively met with in this order, such is its excessive tenuity, that it can hardly be considered as uniting the surfaces, and its use seems restricted to the exhalation of synovia. It is not the same thing with muscles ; they might be considered at the same time, round the moveable articulations, both as powers for the whole of the bone, and as resisting agents for their heads ; they prevent displacements by act- ing round and supporting these, their resistance being in proportion to the efforts that tend to dislocation. In fact, it is in great motions these efforts are the most exerted. Now the muscles ad- jacent to the articulation, strongly contracted, and hardened by the contractions, effectually oppose the tendency of the head of the bone to separate from the corresponding one. During rest, when the muscles relaxed, afford little or no resistance, there is no effort to oppose. A limb rendered use- less by palsy, would much sooner be dislocated than another by exterior mechanical violence. The medium of union, in the order of move- VOL. II. <582 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. able articulations characterized by contiguous sur- faces, consists in a substance, the nature of which seems to form the medium between that of the ligaments and that of cartilages. ARTICLE V. Developement of the Osseous System. There is not a single system in the economy that has been more diligently followed up by ana- tomists in its different states, and at the different stages of life than this. The remarkable differ- ence between a bone, considered in the early months, when it is almost exclusively composed of gelatine, with a similar organ viewed in the adult, in which the calcareous substance predomi- nates, has especially directed their attention to this point. Let us examine the phenomena of os- sification in every age; these phenomena may be considered before growth, or subsequent to it. In general, as long as it lasts, there are constantly some parts in the osseous system that are not ossified, such as the neck of the femur, for in- stance. Ossification is not properly completed, nor the bones perfectly formed, until towards the sixteenth or eighteenth year, even sometimes later.83 OSS ICO US SYSTEM. SECTION I. State of the Osseous System during Growth. In the clevelopement of bones, three states are generally observed, namely, the mucous state, the cartilaginous, and that of solid bone. Mucous State. The mucous state may be conceived at two distinct epochs; 1st. In the early days of the developement of the embryo, when the sum of the organs is nothing more than a mucous homo- geneous mass, in which no outlines can be traced, and there is only parenchyma of nutrition. At that epoch all the organs are of the same nature: the bone, in fact, is like every other organ, a mu- cous substance, if by this word be understood a state in which the cellular tissue existing alone with the vessels and nerves is permeated with such a quantity of juices that it bears the appearance of pulp, and gives that appearance to the embryo. 2d. By this word, a mucous state may also be conceived; that epoch in which the nutrition of bones is more forward, when the bones already be- gin to be distinct, and appear through the transpa- rency, which the other parts of the limb still pre- g 2I 84 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. serve; and when they have already acquired a de- gree of consistence much superior to that of all that surround them. Now this is merely the first degree of the cartilaginous state, for the parenchyma of nutrition assumes a cartilaginous character as soon as it begins to be impregnated with gelatine, and, in fact, it is impregnated with this substance from the moment it acquires more consistence, since it is this substance that gives to it the de- gree of consistence, and on this account, an ex- istence distinct from the surrounding parts. If, in the early periods of conception, this cartilage be softer, if it diffuse under the finger, if even it partly bear a mucous appearance, it is because it does not contain a sufficient proportion of gela- tine, and that the nutritive parenchyma still predominates ; in proportion as we advance in age its quantity increases, and for this reason the cartilaginous state is more evident. Hence it follows there are three periods in the developement of bones; the first it shares in com- mon with every other organ ; the mucous predo- minates ; the two others, especially, characterize these organs. In these the cartilage and the bone predominate. Let us examine their phenomena. Cartilaginous State. All bones prior to assuming this regular form, are of a cartilaginous nature. This cartilaginous85 OSS LOUS SYSTEM. state begins at an epoch that can hardly be ascer- tained : on the one part it is, when the circulating system begins to convey gelatine, and to provide the organs with that substance ; on the other part, when the organic sensibility of the paren- chyma of nutrition for these organs, has become connected with that substance : then the consist- ence in bones progressively increases, because the gelatine is gradually accumulated. Now this ac- cumulates in the same manner as the calcareous phosphate at a later period; that is to say, it is in the middle of the long bones, in the centre of the flat, and also in the middle of the short bones, that this substance is at first exhaled, and from thence is successively extended to the ends of the first, to the circumference of the second, and to the surface of the third. I myst observe, however, that during the formation of cartilagi- nous bones, these longitudinal striee in long bones, radiated or divergent in the flat ones, and irre- gularly interwoven in the short bones ; that cha- racterize the bony state in its formation, and that seem to point out the course of the calcareous substance, are not observed. The cartilaginous state displays a peculiarity that distinguishes it from that of bone ; namely, that all the bones that will subsequently be united by means of cartilage, as those of the skull, of the face, of the spine, of the pelvis, form but one and the same pieces, whilst all those which are to86 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. be united by ligaments only, consequently in- tended for the moveable articulations, as the femur, the tibia, the clavicle, &c. &c. are very distinct. The flat bones, especially those of the skull, do not display a cartilaginous state in so striking a light. In this period of ossification their appear- ance, proceeding from the following causes, is ra- ther more that of a membrane :—As they are in- terposed between the periosteum and the dura- mater, and their tenuity is excessive, they can- not be perceived without the utmost difficulty in the interior of these two membranes : but when- ever the parts are dissected with due attention, the bone, although still soft, may be distinguished from this double envelopement. The cartilaginous state is apparent in the clavi- cle, the shoulder bone, and the ribs, prior to its being distinct in the other bones wherein it is subsequently deposited. When the bones are ex- amined in that state, they disclose different de- grees of consistence and solidity. Where exhala- tion of gelatine has commenced, they are but im- perfectly cartilaginous, and in proportion as we examine them at an earlier period, they are still seen to partake more or less of the mucous state : the cartilaginous bone is unprovided with an in- ernal cavity, with a medullary system, &c.OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 87 Osseous State. Whenever the whole bone is cartilaginous, and even when some dots of a mucous nature still appear, the exhalation of the calcareous sub- stance begins, and consequently the bony state is manifested. Its progress is as follows—The bone first becomes more dense, subsequently as- sumes a deeper hue, finally a very striking yellow one in its middle ; that is to say, where ossifica- tion is to begin. A red dot is gradually formed, which arises from the vessels conveying red blood, and not from their recent developement, as some anatomists have pretended, or from being forced into these parts, according to their own expres- sion, by the impulse of the heart. These vessels ex- isted before, but circulated only white fluids, after- wards red globules are admitted, and at the same time the adjacent parts are also impregnated with calcareous phosphates. This period is therefore remarkable for two facts, namely, for the circu- lation of blood in the cartilaginous bones, and the exhalation of the phosphate of lime. In general these two phenomena are never separated, when the red hue is observed in a cartilaginous ossifica- tion. This is not only observed in common ossifi- cations, but also in those that are subjected to the common laws, such as the ossification of the car- tilages of the larynx, of the ribs, &c. Whenever88 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. the progress of the exhalation of the earthy sub- stance is examined, a vascular layer, very red, interposed between the cartilage and the part of the ossified bone, is always seen. This layer seems to be a forerunner of the state of solid bone. Why is it, that the vessels of the bones, which till then only contained white fluids, begin to circulate red globules? It is not, as Boerhaave would have said, if he had studied os- sification, because their diameter is increased, but actually because the sum of their organic sensibi- lity increasing, they become then connected with the red portion. Their diameter might twice or three times exceed that of the red globules, but these will never penetrate them, if re- jected by the mode of organic sensibility, in the same manner as the larynx repels any sub- stance that tends to penetrate it, although this substance is much inferior in size to the glottis. It is by an increase of organic sensibility. It should also be explained why the bone, so far unconnected with the calcareous substance, and admitting of gelatine, also appropriates the first substance, and is easily imbedded with it. I shall only observe, there is this distinction between the exhalation of the one, and of the other, that the former always proceeds directly from the red part of the blood, since wherever it is deposited, there are, as I have stated, blood- vessels, whilst the latter appears to proceed im-OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 89 mediately from the white fluids, since the vessels of the tendons, cartilages, and the other parts that are sustained by it, do not evidently, at least in their natural state, admit any red globules, and that every thing therein circulated, is apparently white. The formation of bone commences towards the end of the first month, in the clavicle, the ribs, &c.; it is rather more retarded in the other bones: its progress in the three species is as fol- lows.— Progress of Ossification in the Long Bones. First, in the middle of these bones there is a small bony cylinder, very thin in the centre, gra- dually assuming a trumpet-like form towards the ends, leaving a space in its interior for the rudi- ments of the medullary system, and perforated very obviously to receive the large nutritious vessel. This ossified cylinder, at first very thin, when compared with the cartilaginous ends of the bones, evidently disproportionate in this respect, and composed of very minute fibres, progressively in- creases both in bulk and length, and finally, draws towards the ends, where it reaches at the time of birth ; at this time, the greatest part of the heads are not yet ossified; soon after, at an epoch that varies according to the different species of bones, an ossified dot, constantly preceded by the ad-90 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. mission of blood into the vessels, forms in the centre of these ends. These new rudiments are formed at the expense of the cartilage that gradually contracts between the body of the bone and the heads; after some time, there only remains a thin partition, that also be- comes ossified; so that the bone becomes solid throughout its whole length. The secondary dots, that had formed in the different apophyses, also unite, by which means, its substance becomes every where homogeneous. Nature has rarely completed this work before the ages of sixteen or eighteen years. Progress of Ossification in the Flat Bones. In these bones, the mode of ossification varies, those that are symmetrical, constantly display two or more of these dots on each side of the median line, corresponding with each other; in some in- stances, one forms over the line. When these points of ossification are of equal number, they are placed on the sides, if not, one is formed upon the line itself. Sometimes the irregular bones have but one, such as the parietal for instance, at other times several are formed, as in the temporal bones; but in such cases, they never assume a parallel disposition with each other, but merely correspond with those of the opposite bone.91 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. In that part of the flat bone, where the first rudiment of ossification is displayed, vascular dots are at first observed. The calcareous phos- phate is seen to radiate from the centre to the circumference, the divergent ossified rays are very evident in the bones of the skull. Unos- sified substance, at first, occupies the interstices they leave between them, but these are subse- quently filled up with additional rays, all termi- nating in an uneven process, and without being contiguous to each other, so that by separating an ossified part of a flat bone from the membranous portion to which it adheres, its circumference ap- pears indented or scolloped like the end of a comb. Hence, as we shall perceive, the origin of sutures. In the early periods of ossification, the tenuity of these bones is almost beyond description, they are not as yet possessed of cancelli; at birth but very few of these rudiments of ossification have united, being separated by cartilaginous and mem- branous spaces ; these spaces are more extensive on a level w7ith the angles, than on a level with the ridges, and in general, in the most distant parts from the originally ossified centres. The bones possessed of several of the rudiments, are formed of separate parts, more or less distant from each ; those with a single centre of ossification have one only. Subsequent to birth, these bones extend still more, they increase in thickness and solidity, and92 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. divide into two compact tables, the interspace of which is filled with cancelli; gradually the edges come in contact, and then sutures are formed in the skull; for there is this distinction between their ossification and that in the long bones, that it constantly goes diverging from the centre to the circumference, and new rudiments are not formed in this circumference to meet the others. When this takes place, then the re-union is not forwarded as in the long bones, but sutures form, and it is this process that constitutes the wormian bones, that are larger in proportion, as the nucleus has been sooner formed, because it has had sufficient time to extend before meet-’ ing with the general ossification of the bone. When a flat bone is developed in different parts, and it contains an articulating surface, this is generally the centre, in which all the points meet, when ossification is nearly completed ; the cotyloid cavity, the condyle of the occipital, &c. are instances of this. There are frequently two very distinct epochs in the ossifications of flat bones, that, like the sacrum or the sternum, form in numerous parts. These rudiments first unite into three or four essential pieces that divide the bone; this is the first period; subsequently, the union of these parts takes place ; this constitutes the second period of ossification.OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 93 Progress of Ossification in the Short Bones. These organs generally remain cartilaginous much longer than the others; even at birth, several are frequently in this state, particularly those of the tarsus, and of the carpus. The bodies of the vertebrae ossify much sooner, a nucleus forms in the centre and extends all over the surface. These phenomena are nearly similar to those ascertained in the progress of ossification in the heads of the long bones, with which the short bear so much analogy. Subsequent to birth, the whole of the cartilaginous substance is invaded, as it were, by the calcareous substance, with which it intermixes, and finallv, there remains no other cartilaginous part, except that of the articula- tions. There are bones that unite, such as the occi- pital, the sphenoidal, the characters both of the long and of the short bones; their mode is mixed, and follows that of each, according to the part in which it is examined. SECTION IT. State of the Osseous System subsequent to Growth. Ossification being completed, the bones con- tinue to undergo different phenomena, whichOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 94 anatomists have too long neglected. The gene- ral growth in stature, is completed with the pro- cess of ossification, and it even appears that both cease nearly at the same time ; but increase of bulk is still for a long time continued ; if we only compare the slender and eniacmted frame of a youth of eighteen, with the well proportioned form of a middle aged man, the difference is striking. Bones follow the general law; their nutrition, in respect to bulk, is still continued, when that in the longitudinal sense has subsided. It appears in this instance, that the vessels which enter the apertures of the first and second orders, have hardly any thing more to do with the pro- cess of nutrition, the materials for which are sup- plied from those of the third. Now, as we are perfectly aware that these very superficial vessels, are lost in the external fibres of the bone, and do not penetrate into the interior, it must be con- ceived ; 1st. how growth being outwardly con- tinued, the bone must increase in thickness; 2dly. how this increase especially operates upon the compact tissue, whose thickness is in a direct pro- portion with the age, as is easily ascertained by comparing the different bones in the infant, with those of the adult, and of the aged subject. This external increase has led to a supposition that the periosteum especially contributed to it by the ossification of its lamellee; but in the95 OSSEOUS SYSTEM, chapter that treats of this membrane, we shall see how far such an opinion must be trusted to. It is chiefly at this epoch, in which the process of nutrition seems applied to the surface of the bones, that the different elevations on their sur- face become still more prominent, particularly the apophyses for insertions. In respect to these, there is a remarkable difference between the skeleton of a child, and that of a man ; in the foetus, these projections are scarcely existing, as mav be seen in the different apophyses of the vertebrae, particularly in the spinous apophyses. As such projections, in general, are at the greatest distance from the primitive centre of os- sification, it appears that the slowness of their progress must be attributed to this circumstance, since ossification constantly proceeds on from the point wherein it commenced to those more distant. When the bone has acquired all its dimensions, it still continues to be the focus of very active nutrition ; exhalation incessantly supplies it with gelatine and calcareous matter that are subse- quently taken up by absorption, so that this or- gan is uninterruptedly composed and decom- posed ; the experiment tried with madder, indis- putably establishes the fact; if an animal, par- ticalarly a young one, has for some time been fed upon this plan, all its bones become red, so that, on amputating a limb, they present anOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 9G appearance quite different to the natural one; if subsequent to the amputation, the madder be dis- continued for some time, and another limb be re- moved, the bone will have completely re-assumed its natural hue. Now, is it not sufficiently known, that the calcareous substance is the colouring vehicle; since, as long as the bones remain in a cartilaginous state, the madder has no effect. The calcareous substance, then, is alternately conveyed to, or taken away from, the bones ; be- sides, the formation and resolution of exostoses, the softening and brittleness of the bone, the phe- nomena of the production of the callus, &c., are they not evident proofs of the successive exhala- tion and absorption of this principle ? It appears evident, that nature has selected the urinary sys- tem to expel the earthy and even the gelatinous substance. It would be interesting to analyze, pro- perly, the urine of rickety subjects, and of those afflicted with cancer ; it is highly probable that the first of these substances predominates in the first case, and the second, in the other. Nothing very positive, I believe, has yet been dis- covered in this respect by experiments. Will gelatine, or calcareous phosphates, given to pa- tients, restore to the bones, either the suppleness or consistence they have lost ? No, undoubtedly, because it is not sufficient to introduce these sub- stances into the economy, but also to restore to the bones the mode of organic sensibility they are97 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. deprived of, by which means they are enabled to appropriate these substances for their nu- trition. The blood might be overloaded with earthy and gelatinous principles, yet the bones will reject these principles as long as their mode of sensibility does not harmonize with them. The twofold motion of nutrition is always con- tinued in bones, in proportion as we gradually advance in years ; but its proportions alter, gela- tine progressively declines, and; the earthy sub- stance assumes an increasing ratio. Finally, in extreme old age, this last substance predominates to such a degree, that it would annihilate life in these organs, if general death did not anticipate the partial event. To this, the grayish hue which these organs then assume must be attributed; hence also'proceed their progressively increasing weight; hence, consequently, the difficulties that attend the motions of the limbs, since, as the muscular powers are gradually destroyed by age, the bony resistance they have to contend with in- creases. At that stage of life, the calcareous substance predominates in the economy to such a degree, that it invades different organs, such as the arteries, the cartilages, the tendons, which then assume a bony character. It might be said, that by thus accumulating, in our parts, a substance uncon- VOL. II. H98 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. nected with life, nature, in an insensible manner, prepares them for death. In general, the organs that select gelatine for their habitual nutritive substance, are those which have the most tendency to become connected with the earthy substance, and, consequently, to be impregnated with it. This explains why the cartilages are more generally ossified : why, those of the sutures disappearing, the bones of the head become united ; why the larynx finally becomes nearly a complete bone; why the cartilages of the ribs are sometimes as solid as these very organs : why, frequently, several vertebrae united together, will then form a continued mass more or less considerably extended. I must observe, however, that the arteries which have so much tendency to ossification, are not so evidently of a gelatinous nature, as many other substances that do not so readilv admit of ossification, such as the tendons, for instance. section in. Phenomena peculiar to the Formation of Callus. From what has hitherto been stated, respecting the nutrition of bones, nothing is more easy to conceive than this phenomenon. It has three periods, as is sufficiently known ; 1st, the develope-, OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 99 / ixient of granulations ; 2dly, the transformation into a cartilage ; 3dly,the change of this cartilage into solid bone. This threefold phenomenon re- quires a space of time, that varies, according to the age of the subject, the nature of the fracture, and the species of bone, &c., but which generally requires more time than any other kind of cica- trization. The formation of granulations is a phenomenon common to every kind of organ that has been di- vided, when the edges of the division are not in immediate contact; here granulations arise from all the parts of the divided surface, from the pe- riosteum, from the compact tissue, and particularly from the cancelli. Those from one side meet and unite with those of the opposite one, and so far the cicatrization of bones differs in no respect from that of every other part. This state cor- responds with the mucous state of natural ossi- fication. As granulations are nothing but an ex- tension of the parenchyma of nutrition, they are possessed of the same vital powers,and their organic sensibility follows the same laws as in common nutrition ; it first becomes connected with gela- tine; this substance, consequently, is exhaled in it; then begins the cartilaginous state : then the cicatrization of the bone assumes a peculiar cha- racter, that distinguishes it from that of all other organs. u 3OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 100 After a longer space of time, organic sensibi- lity is exalted in the parenchyma of cicatrization formed by the granulations ; it then becomes con- nected with the calcareous substance, which, as well as the red part of the blood, is admitted, the latter always preceding the process of ossifi- cation. / By this it is seen that the callus is both cellular and vascular in the first period ; that it contains celltilar tissue and vessels, as well as gelatine, in the second ; that in the third, cellular tissue, vessels, gelatine, and also calcareous substance, are met with. The regular forms of the sound bone are not to be expected here, because the parenchyma of nutrition, arising irregularly over the surfaces of the organ, the exhalation and absorption of gela- tine cannot be performed in a precise and regular manner. The callus is so much the thicker as the ends have remained the further separated, because the granulations having had more space to over- run before they could meet those of the opposite part, are more extended, and have consequently absorbed more nutritive substance. If the constant motion of the fractured parts check granulation in both, or, what is the same thing, if it prevent the parenchymoe of cica- trization from uniting, notwithstanding the ex- halation of the nutritive substances in each, theOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 101 bone must remain disunited: lienee unnatural ar- ticulations. The callus forms with difficulty, whenever the ends, divided and laid bare, join with the ad- jacent parts in the suppuration, as is the case in complicated fractures, because the formation of pus expends the nutritive substance intended to repair the injury. Further considerations on this singular production belong to pathology. In this chapter I have neglected to bring for- ward the notions of the ancients, who supposed that bones were formed by the hardening of a bony juice, the existence of which has never been demonstrated. Haller's ideas were, that the im- pulse of the heart formed arterial ducts in the bony substance, and hardened that substance by the pulsation of the arteries. DuhamePs notions were, that every thing depended upon the perios- teum. I shall refer to the books that have re- peatedly exposed these opinions. Without entering upon any individual refu- tation of any of these doctrines, I shall observe they are all stamped with a fundamental defect; that of considering the nutrition in bones in an isolated manner, and not representing it as a division of nutrition at large ; of admitting, for its explanation, arguments singly applicable to these organs, and that are not consequent to those which serve to ascertain the nutrition of every other organ. Let us never lose sight of that102 OSSLOUS SYSTEM. essential principle on which every phenomenon in the economy rests; namely, that a few causes give rise to a multiplicity of effects. Let us guard against every partial, and mutilated explanation that would tend to limit the resources of nature, within the narrow compass of our feeble and de- ficient comprehension. SECTION IV. Phenomena peculiar to the Formal ion of Teeth. The teeth, differing in some degree in their tissue from the other bones, are also possessed of a peculiar mode of nutrition, which we shall now consider; but as the knowledge of this implies also that of the general structure of these organs, it will be proper to examine here this structure, referring their description till the bones of the face are examined. Organization of the Teeth. The teeth are formed of two substances, the one exterior, of a peculiar nature, termed enamel; the other interior, which forms the basis as it were, the tissue of which is the same as that of the other bones. They have also a small cavity filled with a spongy substance, which is still but imperfectly known.OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 103 The Enamel of the Tooth. The enamel is only found round the crown of the tooth. Several anatomists have asserted, that it exists in some degree over the root, grounding their opinion, I suppose, on the excessive whiteness of some drawn teeth, which prevents the line where it terminates from being seen; but in such cases a very simple experiment will point out the distinc- tion. This method consists in macerating the tooth in nitric acid, diluted with a certain quantity of water; the acid will operate both upon the root, and upon the crown, which it softens ; but like al- most every other animal substance submitted to its action, the one becomes yellow, whilst the other preserves its appearance, and even becomes whiter. This experiment proves likewise, that their respective natures also essentially differ. The enamel thick in the free part of the crown, becomes gradually thinner as it draws near the root. This disposition is indispensable to protect the tooth, and chiefly to bear the efforts of masti- cation, which chiefly affect the free part of the crown. This substance hard and compact, particularly after having been exposed to the air, yielding with difficulty to the file, is composed of very close fibres, the direction of which cannot be followed. It seems impermeable to the medullary oil; doesOSSEOUS SYSTEM. 104 not admit of combustion, but bursts in the fire, and thus separates from the other tissue, which, when exposed to caloric, at first blackens, and subsequently burns like every other bone, and exhales the same smell. Is the enamel organized, or is it merely a juice which, at first transuding from the external surface of the tooth, hardens and concretes ? This question will not, I think, be easily solved. The enamel, in fact, is possessed of properties that seem to admit of these two opinions with equal probability. On the one part it enjoys sensibility in common with every other organized part; it feels the sensations caused by contact, more evidently than the hair and the nails; the diluted acids, especially those borrowed from vegetables, exalt its sensibility to such a degree, that the slighest contact is attended with great pain a long time even after their application. The teeth then, ac- cording to the vulgar expression, are said to be set on edge. On the other hand, the enamel has many properties that seem to deny the existence of or- ganization ; 1st. It never admits of combustion; is never the seat of any tumour, of any alteration tending to soften its tissue ; it is never seen to undergo any change by which its vitality is in- creased beyond the natural state ; such, for in- stance, as is the case with hair, which, although generally inert, displays, however, in the plicae polonicee, very great vital activity. In fact, we105 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. often judge of the vitality of an organ more from its morbid alterations than its natural state ; 2d. It appears that, in the enamel there is no such thing as alternate exhalation aud absorption of nutritive matter, in a visible manner at least. It is worn away without being renewed. This is re- markable in the aged subject, and in those that fre- quently gnash their teeth. The enamel may be filed as any inorganic body, and is never re-pro- duced, whilst the hair, and the nails, evidently grow after they have been cut. If the end of a long bone sawed in amputation be filed, granula- tions will soon form over the surface, the action of the instrument being a stimulant that excites developement of the vital phenomena. The bony part of the tooth, forms the whole root and the interior of the crown ; it is only com- posed of compact tissue, excessively dense, bear- ing the utmost analogy with that of the rock,—it has no cancelli. Its fibres strongly compressed together, take various directions, that cannot be easily followed, but which are generally arranged as those in the roots; to obtain a correct view of these, the tooth must be softened by an acid. Each tooth contains within the crown a cavity of the same form, which decreases in diameter as we advance in years; which communicates out- wardly by small tubes equal in number with the distinct roots of the tooth, and opens over the106 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. summit of these roots. This cavity is lined with a very thin membrane, in which the vessels ramify, and which incloses the pulp. Soft Part of the Tooth. This is a spongy substance, that seems formed by the interweaving of the vessels and nerves peculiar to each tooth, the nature of which, how- ever, is not yet sufficiently known, but which en- joys animal sensibility to a high degree, equal at least with that of the medullary organ. This is proved, 1st. By the pains caused by a carious tooth, in which the pulp is left bare, and which, as we are aware, are most excruciating ; 2dly. By introducing a stylet into the opening of the cavity, an operation, that at first is not felt, but which gives great pain on the instru- ment reaching the pulp ; odly. By opening an alveolus in a very young animal, a long time previous to dentition, the pulp, at this stage of life, is very considerable, and the tooth be- ing proportionally small, is easily removed from it without injury, because it is not yet provided with a root, and the opening of the basis of the crown is very wide. When the tooth is elevated, and the pulp thus laid bare is irritated in any manner whatever, the animal appears to suffer acutely. I have frequently repeated this experi-OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 107 liieut, which on account of the tenuity of the bony plates that form the sockets, is easily per- formed. The teeth have very remarkable sympathies, that do not act upon the solid part, but on the pulp; as this is proportionally much larger in early life, forming the largest portion of the tooth, these sympathies are at that stage both more fre- quent and better characterized ; sometimes the animal properties, at other times, the organic are called into action by these sympathies, The sympathies of animal sensibility are dis- played when the tooth becomes painful from cold, or damp affecting the cutaneous system, and in the painful sensations experienced in the face and the / head from caries. Fauchart quotes an instance of an obstinate headache, that had for a long time resisted all kinds of remedies, and which was instantly cured by the extirpation of a tooth. The sensibility of' the eye, and of the ear, is in- creased in violent tooth-aches, &c.; animal con- tractility is also brought into action by the sympathies of the teeth; nothing is more frequent during dentition than convulsions in the volun- tary muscles. Tissot, mentions a spasm in those of the jaw, which was cured by drawing two teeth, and a convulsion in the muscles of the throat, that terminated in death, the primitive cause of which proceeded from a decayed tooth, &c., See.10S OSSl'OUS SYSTEM. Organic sympathies are not less frequently produced by the affections of the teeth. Spasmo- dic vomiting, diarrhoea, acceleration of the pulse, frequently, even involuntary evacuation of urine, phenomena over which the sensible organic con- tractility of the stomach, the intestines, the heart, and of the bladder preside, are the frequent effects of dentition, particularly the first, as well as of violent tooth-aches, &c. Insensible organic con- tractility, and organic sensibility, are sympatheti- cally excited in obstructions in the parotid gland, in the general swelling of the face, in the increased secretion of saliva, and sometimes, in erysipelas, caused by an acute affection of these small and painful organs. Sympathies between the corresponding teeth in the same row, or between those of the two rows are frequently to be observed. My first superior left grinder is rather affected with caries, and sometimes causes much pain, and the opposite one on the right side becomes painful, although perfectly sound. There are other instances, in which a tooth of the lower jaw being affected, sympathetic pains are felt in the one above, and vice versa. The structure of the teeth being explained, let us now consider in what manner their different substances are formed. This point of bony nutri- tion appears to me, to have been but imperfectly investigated by the various authors. I shall *en-109 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. i deavour to elucidate it better. There are two kinds of dentition, the one temporary, and re- stricted to the early stages of infancy, the other belongs to the whole of life ; each must be con- sidered previous to, during, and subsequent to, the protrusion. < The first Dentition previous to the appearance of the Teeth. The phenomena of dentition, previous to the period of protrusion, are as follows : the jaws of the foetus are closed all over their free ridge, they appear homogeneous at first sight; but when viewed internally, they display a number of small membranous follicles, divided by thin partitions situate in the sockets, in the same symmetrical or- der as the teeth, that will subsequently arise from them in the following manner. The membrane that envelopes the follicle forms a bag without any opening, that first lines the parieties of the alveolus, to which it adheres by ex- tensions : on reaching the part in which the ves- sels and nerves penetrate, it leaves the socket, frees itself, falls backward, forming a tube that attends the vascular and nervous bundle, and finally expands over the pulp of the tooth in which the bundle terminates.110 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. From this it results, that this membrane has the general conformation of serous membranes, the shape of a kind of night-cap, as is vulgarly said. There are two parts, the one adhering to, and lining the socket, the other free, and enveloping the pulp ; such, for instance, as the pleurae, that have a costal and a pulmonic side. The pulp and the vessel, although rapt up by this fold, are actu- ally then without the cavity, which is lubricated by a moisture. I found that this moisture, simi- lar to that of the serous membranes, was essen- tially of an albuminous nature : the action of ni- tric acid, of alcohol and caloric clearly proves it. When submitted to the action of one of these agents, particularly the first, the membrane sud- denly becomes white, the albuminous coat that covers it concretes and coagulates, just in the same manner as when a similar experiment'is tried upon a serous substance. The pulp, rather considerable at that age, is suspended like a bunch of grapes, as it were, from the ends of the vessels and nerves. It is over the pulpous part of the membrane of the follicle, and on the surface of its floating end, the first rudiment of ossification is ob- served ; it soon extends, and assumes the shape of the summit of the crown it is intended to form ; that is to say, a cubic form for the grinders, a pointed one for the canine teeth, and for theOSSEOUS SYSTEM. Ill *incisores : first unfolded towards the gums, it sub- sequently extends from the vascular and nervous pedicle, moulds itself upon this in proceeding to that part of the alveolus, where it penetrates; so that, in this part, it forms a concave surface which encompasses the pulpous portion of the membrane, and adheres to it by different vascular extensions ; and as this portion floats, the first rudiment of the tooth floats along with it in the cavity of the membrane, as is easily ascertained by di- viding the alveolar part of this membrane, after having destroyed the corresponding side of the socket. The following are the consequences of this mode of developement: 1st, the crown is first formed, and the root is gradually produced, as ossifica- tion following the longitudinal direction, advances over that part of the membrane which lines the nervous and vascular bundle: 2dly, as all the ves- sels that resort to the tooth penetrate through the internal surface, since the external is com- pletely free within the cavity of the membrane, ossification, in diameter, is especially continued to the detriment of the internal cavity that gradually decreases, as well as the pulp, a reverse disposi- tion to that of every other bone, in which ossifi- cation begins in the centre of the cartilage, and which, primitively solid in that part, after- wards becomes hollow for the formation of theOSSKOUS SYSTEM. m cellular and medullary cavities, that gradually increase: 3dly, when the ossification of the tooth is completed, the portion of the membrane of the follicle that lined the socket remains the same, whilst the part corresponding to the pulp, previously free on the other side, becomes on this, adherent to the whole cavity of the socket, that is lined by it, forming the membrane already mentioned when speaking of the structure of the teeth, which membrane is interposed be- tween the pulp and the bony substance : 4thly, the pulp of the tooth is the first portion that is formed, it forms also the most considerable part of the tooth in the early times. Subsequent to this, it seems the bony part is produced, and that finally the enamel forms over it. I have not yet been able to exemplify this mode of origin. The period, for the formation of the membran- ous follicle is difficult to ascertain; that of the first ossification seems to be between the fourth and fifth month. At birth, the twenty teeth of the first dentition are already seen rather forwarded ; the rudiments of the root in the shape of a wide tube, with very thin parieties, gradually extend- ing in both directions, also begin to be perceived : on reaching the bottom of the socket, this last being too narrow to contain the tooth, the organ forces its way out.OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 113 i The number of teeth less in the first dentition than in the second, imparts to the jaws of the foetus and of the infant, a peculiar form, espe- cially to the lower jaw, which projects less, and is consequently larger in proportion than in the adult, in which the ridge where the alveoli are situate must unavoidably be more extended to receive all the teeth. This disposition of the lower jaw has a great influence upon the expression of the features. First Dentition considered during the Protrusion. Towards the sixth or seventh month subsequent to birth, very seldom before, still less frequently during pregnancy, although there are some instances of it, as is proved by the history of Lewis XIV., the following phenomena are ob- served. Sometimes simultaneously, at other times in an isolated manner, the two small incisores of the lower jaw, and soon after the corresponding ones of the upper jaw, begin first to appear. A month or two subsequent to this, the four other in- cisores are produced. Towards the end of the first year, generally the four canine teeth are cut. At the end of the second, and frequently later than this, two grinders are seen to project from each jaw, and are soon followed by two more, each eruption generally beginning with the inferior VOL. ii.OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 114 jaw. At the age of four years, four and a half, and sometimes at five, and even six, constantly, however, at an uncertain period, two other grinders, first below, then above, are produced, they complete the number of twenty-four, of which the first dentition is composed. In fact, all these teeth afterwards fall out and are re- placed by new ones. The mechanism of this first dentition is as fol- lows :—The ossification constantly advancing to- wards the root, the whole tooth can no longer be contained within the alveolus, and forces its way through the alveolar part of the membrane, the mucous membrane of the mouth, and an inter- posed pulpous tissue that separates them ; this is the . more easily effected, because this threefold layer becomes gradually thinner as we draw nearer to the time when they appear. Does this phenome- non proceed only from the mechanical pressure of the tooth ? I think there must be another cause ; for here we should observe, they are hardly ele- vated before they are perforated ; whilst, by a polypus, or other tumours that frequently form under the membrane of the gums, it is much more extended ; but still in these cases it is not lacerated but lifted up. The mechanism of the cutting of the gums has not been better elucidated, than the principle of the fatal accidents that so fre- quently attend this event. The bag formed by the primitive membrane of the follicle being116 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. thus laid open, the part that lined the socket unites with the membrane of the mouth, is con- tinued with it, and adheres at the same time to the ridge in the most intimate manner ; and as during the formation of the root, the internal surface of this membranous portion, at first per- fectly free, as we have seen, has gradually become strongly attached to it, it follows, that this root is incased between the part belonging to the socket that lines it outwardly, and the pulpous part that lines the interior : this is what secures its solidity. In proportion as the adhesions of the membrane increase, it is more difficult to distin- guish. In the first dentition, the formation of the root is very seldom so completely effected as in the second; its internal cavity is also much wider, and the pulp is larger. Second Dentition considered previous to the Protrusion. The nutritive phenomena ought, as in the preceding case, to be distinguished in those pro- duced previous to, during and subsequent to the eruption. Before this event, on opening the jaw, a row of teeth like follicles is noticed. It corresponds with the row of teeth already formed, either under them or sideways, and separated from them by small partitions, which are thicker i 2OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 116 , as we are nearer to the earliest years of in- These follicles have precisely the same dispo- sition as those of the first dentition. Like these they form pouches without openings; the al- veolar portion of which adheres to the free and pulpous part, and collects over its surface the first rudiments of ossification to form the crown. The mode of growth is also the same ; that is to say, the increase takes place from the interior to the exterior, in a reverse sense to what is observed in other bones; by which disposition the part of the tooth in immediate contact with foreign bo- dies, being the first formed, has more time to ac- quire that degree of solidity indispensable to the use for which it is intended. In proportion as the secondary teeth grow, their vascular system is seen to increase, and that of the old ones to decrease, proceeding from the sensibility, which being reduced in the former, attracts no more blood, whilst exalted in the lat- ter it strongly attracts that fluid. It is also ob- served, that the partitions of the sockets are re- duced in thickness, and that the roots of the first decay. This twofold phenomenon does not ap- pear to proceed from any pressure of the tooth over the rising one, since in this case the root would only spread and be flattened ; or if it ac- tually were destroyed, some remnants would be found, which is not the case. It is then highlyOSSEOUS SVSTEM. 117 probable, that the roots and partitions are destroy- ed by an absorption of the calcareous phosphate, nearly in the same way as we have stated that the internal cavities of the cartilaginous bones are formed. From this it is seen, that the ossification of the roots of the first dentition, is but of short con- tinuance ; it begins the last and ends the first; when it is nearly completed the teeth begin to move for want of sufficient insertion. The de- struction of the partition increases the motion; they begin to fall towards the sixth or seventh year; this is affected in the same order as that of their protrusion ; that is to say, the incisores begin to fall, the cuspidati follow, then the molares drop in turn. Let us remark, however, that the lasty. those which appeared at four years of age, are not renewed. Second Dentition considered daring the Protrusion. During the protrusion of the second teeth, they are seen to grow gradually and in the same order as those corresponding to them are loosened ; 1st. The eight incisores ; 2dly. The four canine teeth appear; 3dly. In the place of the first grinder two new ones are formed, they are those that will be afterwards denominated small grinders; 4thly. The second grinder, as we have just said, re-118 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. mains; it is the first of the large teeth; 5thly. At the age of eight or nine years, two second grinders come forth in each jaw; Finally. At eighteen, twenty, and thirty years, even some- times later, a third grinder also appears; this is vulgarly called the wise tooth. Each jaw then contains sixteen teeth ; four cutting teeth, two canine teeth, two small grinders, and three large ones. Sometimes in forming, the secondary teeth in- stead of appropriating to themselves the nutri- tive substance of the roots and partitions of the former, leave them entire ; they do not destroy each other; and the eruption of the second teeth takes place along the side of the first that have remained ; this phenomenon in general only takes place in respect to an isolated tooth ; but sometimes several, and even the whole row, will produce instances of it; the second teeth, gene- rally speaking, have no other tendency than that of cutting through the sides of the gums. When placed in a very oblique direction from mal-con- formation ; their crowns are turned inwards, and instead of cutting through the jaw, they remain buried within their sockets. I Phenomena subsequent to the Cutting of the Second Teeth. The teeth evidently grow subsequent to the protrusion—1st. I11 the longitudinal direction;OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 119 2dly. Transversely. The root only grows in the first direction; it always preserves the same di- mensions ; and if in old age it appears to be longer, it is because the gums are depressed; a phenomenon that is also frequently observed in emaciated subjects, and in those who have taken mercury, &c. The increase in the second direction does not take place outwardly, but internally ; the tube of the root and the cavity of the body progressively contract, and ultimately become obliterated; then the blood no longer penetrating the tooth, the nerves no longer convey their influence to it; it dies, and falls. This state, however, seems also brought on by the accumulation of the bony sub- stance of a considerable quantity of calcareous phosphate, which so much exceeds the ge- latine, that the principle of life is completely stifled, so that in this respect the fall of the teeth displays a phenomenon similar to that of the horns in the herbivorous species, or of the calcareous envelope, in the crustaceous tribe, &c. Why has nature limited the duration of life in teeth more than other bones, that only cease to exist with the other organs, whilst these perish a long time before ? Is it because the powers of the stomach being weakened by age, animals are thereby reduced to feed only in old age, upon soft substances, accommodated to the languid state of their gastric powers? Undoubtedly withOSSEOUS SYSTEM. no man, numerous causes, arising particularly from the nature of the food, from its degree of heat or cold, from the mode of dressing it, and from its innumerable varieties, accelerate the time of the natural death and fall of the teeth, because by incessantly exciting these organs, they keep them in an habitual state of activity that exhausts their life, which would not otherwise terminate so soon. Thus also will a thousand causes, arising from the state of so- ciety, put an end to general life at a period long before that intended and ascribed by nature it- self; but in general, in animals, the death of the tooth always precedes that of every other organ, and yet these do not live under social influence, and they always masticate food intended by na- ture to be in contact with their teeth. In old age, the jaws robbed of their teeth, con- tract, the sockets are obliterated, the tissue of the gums hardens, and mastication is continued, though more imperfectly. In that change of con- formation, the ridge of the alveoli drops back- wards ; hence the projection of the chin. It de- creases in height; from whence its approximation to the nose, a phenomenon which also especially proceeds from the loss of the teeth.121 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. SECTION Y. Phenomena peculiar to the Formation of the Sesamoid Bones. These organs afford an exception to the general laws of ossification less striking than that of teeth, but which is not the less real. General Disposition of the Sesamoid Bones. These small bones, commonly of a form nearly spherical, and varying in their size, do not in ge- neral, with the exception of the patella, exceed that of a pea. They are generally met with in the limbs only, never in the trunk. In the superior extremities they are commonly found in the hand, where the articulation of the thumb constantly produces two, and sometimes the corresponding articulation of the index; that of the little finger, though rarely, and the phalan- gean articulation of the thumb also, disclose one of these minute organs. In the inferior extremities, on the contrary, they are very numerous and strongly characterized; two are observed upon each condyle of the femur, be- hind the knee ; before is the patella. In the foot, the122 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. tendon of the posterior tibial, near to its insertion into the tuberosity of the os scaphoides, that of the peroneus longus on its crossing under, and the os cuboides are also supplied with sesamoid bones. Two are constantly found under the metatarso- phalangean articulation of the great toe, and under the greatest part of corresponding articulations of the other toes, some are also discovered, although they are more variable. I have also frequently found them in the phalangean articulations. In general the sesamoid bones are only to be seen in the points of flexion, in the direction that has to bear the strongest efforts. In those of extension, I know of none except the patella. These minute bones have not, like the larger, an insulated existence; they are constantly formed in a fibrous organ, either in a tendon like those of the gemelli, the peroneus, the posterior tibial, and the patella also ; or in a ligament, like all those situate anterior to the metacarpo-pha- langean, metatarso-phalangean, or phalangean articulations, which have for their bases, the large transverse fibrous bands, we have denominated anterior ligaments of these articulations. Fibro- Cartilaginous State. The two primitive bases of the sesamoid bones, require a considerable time before their rudiments are developed, and are the same in those parts123 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. where these bones must exist, us in any other. Their organization in general is uniform. Shortly after birth, rather more gelatine than is required for the peculiar nutrition of these two fibrous bodies, begins to be exhaled in those parts which afterwards becoming ossified, form the sesamoid bones; then cartilages essentially distinct from those of common ossifications are formed, which are nearly of the same nature as those of the ends of the long bones in the adult, whilst these actually belong to the class of fibrocartilaginous substances. In their nature they resemble the inarticular fibro-cartilage, those of the tendinous insertions, &c. They are not cartilages, but ac- tually fibrous cartilages of ossification, the fibrous bases of which are more readily discovered, as they are examined nearer to the time of their de- velopement. State of Bone. By degrees, the vessels of this fibro-cartilagi- nous bases, that hitherto circulated white fluids only, become connected with the blood, and are permeated with this fluid; at the same time the cal- careous phosphate begins to be deposited ; then cancelli form in the interior, by a mechanism si- milar to that which produces it in the other bones; a slight compact layer is formed externally ; but in the middle of this new production, the fibrousOSSEOUS SYSTEM. m basis always remains; the fibres of the tendon above the sesamoid bone are continued, as it were, through its substance, with the inferior ones, thus cicatrization in these bones, when frac- tured, displays a peculiar and distinctive charac- ter ; it is their fibrous bases, by extending to effect the re-union, that establishes this differ- ence. We are perfectly aware that the callus in the patella is not the same as in other bones. Frequently, when the dressings have not been properly secured, a fibro-cartilaginous tissue re- mains between the two fragments as a uniting medium; this tissue then is formed, not only of the cartilaginous part of the bone, but also of a portion of the tendon of the extensors that con- tribute to the organization of this bone. The vi- tality of the sesamoid organs partake nearly as much of the fibrous as of that of the bony system. In proportion as age advances, these small bones grow, and become more characterized in the animal economy; some even are formed at a late period, at twenty, thirty, and even forty years of age. In some aged subjects, they acquire in the foot rather a considerable volume. In the dead bodies of two gouty subjects, I have found they were so large as probably to have obstructed progression. Are these organs in any way con- nected with this painful affection ? In this respect I can produce nothing, except the above facts. The sesamoid bones remove their tendons from125 OSSEOUS SYSTEM, the centre of motion, facilitate their glidings over the bones, protect their articulations, and even concur in the motions. All those formed in the anterior metacarpo and metatarso-phalangean, even those of the phalangean articulations, also assist in the motions of these articulations. A por- tion of the synovia is spread over their surface, that remains slightly cartilaginous, and cor- responds to them. The formation of the sesamoid bones is not, as has been asserted, a mechanical effect of the pressure of the tendons and ligaments against the bones, but a result of the laws of ossification. Why, ad- mitting the first supposition, should not every articulation of the hand and foot, besides those above-mentioned, and exposed to nearly the same motions, be equally provided with these organs ?MEDULLARY SYSTEM. Althouth the medullary system is met with in hones only, and its essential uses seem wholly relative ; yet its properties and vitality appear to differ so essentially from the vitality and properties of these organs, that we cannot avoid viewing it in an isolated manner. Two kinds of medullary systems may be dis- tinguished : the one is in the cancelli of the heads of long bones, in the whole interior of the short and flat bones; the other rests exclusively in the middle part of the former. ARTICLE I. Medullary System in the Flat and Short Bones, and in the Heads of the Long Bones. SECTION i. Origin and Conformation. This system appears to be an expansion of the vessels that penetrate the bones through the fora-127 MEDULLARY SYSTEM. mina of the second order, that is to say, through those which proceed to the cancelli. On reaching the internal surface of the cel- lulae, these vessels ramify ad infinitum, and anastomose there in a thousand different ways. Their interweavings give to the interior of the cellular tissue its peculiar florid aspect, and which is more striking as it is examined nearer to the pe- riod of infancy, because, in fact, the vascular sys- tem, very conspicuous at that stage of life, gra- dually contracts and fades away as age ad- vances. It is these vessels that give the red hue to the edge of the saw, when the bones of the skull are perforated by the trepan: these also produce a similar phenomenon in the amputation of a limb. Although at the moment of death they remain generally gorged with a great quantity of blood, yet it is possible, as I have frequently ascertained, to fill them still more by very liquid injections, which forces the blood forward, and concentrates this fluid in their most distant parts; in such cases the spongy tissue of the adult, is almost as red as that of the infant that has not been pre- pared. j128 MEDULLAJIY SYSTEM* SECTION II. Organization. Authors have admitted a thin membrane lining the interior of all the bony cellulse, and which they have considered as the exhalant organ of the medullary juice. Although I have made repeated researches, I could never discover any such membrane. The vascular extensions only I have just been mentioning can be seen, which? being prodigiously multiplied, seem, in fact, to form a kind of membrane, but upon being ex- amined with due attention, are found very dis- tinct from each other, not at all continuous, ex- cept in their anastomoses, and leaving between them innumerable small spaces, by which the bone is evidently left bare, and in immediate con- tact with the medullary substance. The exhalation of this juice seems then ex- clusively to proceed from this vascular network, and in this respect it is similar to that of the com- pact substance, that evidently contains no mem- brane at all, although its pores are filled with medullary juice, as is proved by the combination of the compact tissue, by exposing it to the sun, or to artificial heat.129 MEDULLARY SYSTEM. SECTION in. t Properties. This vascular network possesses only that degree of organic sensibility, and insensible organic con- tractility, indispensable to its functions ; and this is what especially distinguishes it from the medullary system of the middle of the long bones, in which animal sensibility is, as we shall see, strongly cha- racterized. If the interior of a short or of a flat bone, &c. or the ends of a long one, be irritated in a living animal, no signs whatever of animal sensibility are expressed. The sawing of the bone with the trepan, that of the condyles of the femur, or of the head of the humerus, are not attended with pain. The injuries of this system, when very consi- derable, may produce necrosis, and the production of a new bony substance supplied by the perios- teum ; but if a small division only be concerned, this phenomenon is not produced. I have re- peatedly pierced with a gimlet, in a transverse direction, the end of a long bone in an animal, and subsequently passed a red-hot iron through the aperture: the animal invariably recovered without the slightest symptom of necrosis, only the articulation remained obstructed, much im- vol.ii. K130 MEDULLARY SYSTEM. peded in its motions, and different splinters were expelled with the pus. SECTION IV. Dev elopement. The vascular network of which this system is composed, is met with in the cartilaginous state ; but then, on the one hand, it does not admit of the red part of the blood, and on the other, the inter- stices of its meshes are so completely filled with gelatine, that the cartilage presents an homoge- neous appearance. At the epoch of ossification, on one part the red blood penetrates the vessels, whilst on the other, these vessels are left bare by the absorption of gelatine, where the cellulee are, upon the internal surface of which they twine. In the foetus, and in the early period of infancy, this medullary system displays a very remarkable disposition. It hardly contains any of that oily substance from which it borrows its name, and which subsequently fills with such abundance the interstices of the cancelli in the different bones. I have easily convinced myself of this, by com- paring these organs at the different stages of life ; 1st. When exposed to rather a considerable de- gree of heat, that oily juice melts and flows in abundance from the cancelli of the bone of an adult subject. From the same experiment ap-131 MEDULLA It Y SYSTEM. plied to the foetus, the only result is desiccation of this tissue from the evaporation of the fluids with which it was permeated ; 2dly. If the ex- tremity of a long bone of an adult be exposed to fire, combustion is spontaneously kept up by the oily juice that transudes through the pores of the second species, and that supports the blaze until it is exhausted. In the foetus the bone will cease burning as soon as it is taken from the fire, because the fluids it contains are not calculated for combustion; 3dly. Nothing is more difficult than to keep the bones of an adult white, because the oil that penetrates their interstices always gives them rather a yellow appearance. In the fetus and in the infant, where this cause does not exist, the white appearance of the bone is easily obtained; 4thly. In the early years hardly any oil is extracted by ebullition from the cancelli, but a great quantity of this fluid is seen floating over the water in which that of the sub- sequent age has been boiled. The foetus in gene- ral seems totally deprived of medullary oil; it is formed after birth, and gradually increases. What fluid then acts as a substitute to this in the first stage of life ? First, a considerable quantity of blood; for generally the red hue of the medullary system is in a reverse order with the oil it con- tains, but the interstices of the cellulee also ap- pear moistened with an unknown fluid, and that k 2MEDULLARY SYSTEM. 132 evaporates, as I have said, when the bone of a foetus is exposed to fire. ARTICLE II. Medullary System of the Middle of the Long Boties. This system differs essentially from the pre- ceding, in its nature, its properties, and its func- tions, &c.; it is situate in the centre of the long bones, whose largest cavity it fills. SECTION i. Conformation. Each of the organs that contribute to form it has the figure of a thin membrane, lining the whole cavity, repeatedly folded over itself, giving rise to numerous extensions, some of which sur- round the very minute filaments of the cancelli that may be met with in this cavity; the others cross without adhering to any ossified portion from one side of the membrane to the other, the whole of which form cellulae wherein the marrow is contained. i We may then form to ourselves an idea similar to that we have conceived of the cellular organ, namely, that of a spongy body, with cellulae that communicate with each other, the situa-133 31EDULLAUY SYSTEM. tion of which imparts to the whole a cylindrical form. It appears that in the two ends of the tube, the cellulas or membranes do not open into those of the cancelli, and that the medullary juice of the former has no communication with that of the latter. In fact, the line of demarcation is obvious, for they are not gradually confounded together. The air forced into one side of the medullary cylinder, reaches with the utmost diffi- culty only by lacerating the membranes in the cancelli of the opposite head of the bone : how- ever, notwithstanding these considerations, I con- fess the question is not completely resolved. The transudations in dead bodies prove nothing in this effect, on account of the permeability of our parts subsequent to death. SECTION If. Organization. We are but imperfectly acquainted with the tissue of the medullary membrane, because its extreme tenuity renders it imperceptible ; it is only in ricketty subjects that its morbid increase of thickness has enabled me to follow its course with accuracy. It has the same appearance as the cellular tissue, however its properties, and therefore its nature, are very distinct from thoseMEDULLARY SYSTEM* VM of that tissue : it cannot he referred to any of the three classes of the serous, fibrous or mucous sur- faces. Some authors have asserted that it is an expansion of the periosteum that insinuates itself through the numerous pores with which the bone is pierced as it were, and penetrates the medul- lary cavity ; but the slightest comparison between these membranes, is sufficient to show that es- sentially differing in their functions, their vital powers, &c., they cannot be possessed of the same tissue. A principal vessel penetrates the medullary membrane ; it is the artery that enters through the single but striking aperture observed in the body of the long bones; the two branches of this ar- tery, and those of the corresponding vein, ramify in reverse directions over the medullary cylinder, and by the innumerable quantity of their ramus- culee, give it a reddish appearance, that fades with age. The ends borrow their vessels from those of the adjacent cancelli; no nerve can be followed there. Such is, sometimes, the abund- ance of fluids with which this membrane is per- meated, and its excessive tenuity, that its ex- istence might actually be doubted ; to be con- vinced of the contrary, however, only expose the cylinder it forms to a high degree of caloric ; it will instantly shrink and contract in the same manner as every other solid, and will become more conspicuous.MEDULLA HY SYSTEM. 135 SECTION III. Properties. In the medullary organ, the properties of the tissue are strongly characterized. 1st, the spina-ventosa, by which this organ is stretched along with the body of the bone, in a very con- spicuous manner, clearly shows its extensibility. 2dly, the contractility of the tissue is proved by the collapse of the cellulee, subsequent to ampu- tation at the centre of a long bone ; this collapse prevents the effusion of the marrow, that, on ac- count of the existing communications between the cellulas, would otherwise be unavoidable. It is probable that insensible organic con- tractility being excited by the contact of air with this membrane, which shrinks by the irrita- tion, influences also this phenomenon ; for this mode of contractility, as well as the correspond- ing sensibility, are evidently within the attributes of this membrane. In its natural state, the animal sensibility is fully developed : the most agonizing pains proceed from the action of the saw in amputation, from the introduction of a stylet, of the injection of an irritating fluid in the medullary tube, or from any other means that may strongly excite it. I do not speak of the pains felt in bones in the spina-MEDULLARY SYSTEM. 136 ventosa, venereal diseases, &c. : as the membrane is not in its natural state, no consequences can be deduced to appreciate the mode of the vital powers with which it is naturally endowed. I have observed that its sensibility is so much the more striking, as the instrument introduced- in living animals approaches the centre of the bone. In the extremities of the medullary tube, this sen- sibility is rather obscure ; in the middle of the bone the section is very painful. From what can proceed this difference in the sensitive powers, in their gradual decrease from the centre to the ex- tremities ?—the medullary system, evidently, does not possess animal sensibility and sensible organic contractility. From this exposure of the vital powers that animate this system, it is evident that vitality is here much more active than in the svstem of the bones, that their vital phenomena are consequent- ly more rapid, and must deviate from the chronic course that characterizes every disease of the bone, and more readily admits of every sympathetic exci- tation from the other organs. I am convinced that many indefinable painful sensations, that are ge- nerally attributed to the diseases of the bones, arise from the medullary system, especially from that in the middle of the long bones : let us remark, in fact, that the greatest part of these pains are seat- ed in the middle of the limbs, and that they are actually felt in the direction of this system. TheMEDULLARY SYSTEM. 137 medullary system in the heads of the long bones, in the flat and in the short bones, is, no doubt, possessed of more vital energy than the compact tissue : inflammation is more readily produced in the former, and its effects succeed with greater rapidity. Who is not aware, that the progress of caries is so much the more rapid, as the bone contains a greater quantity of cancelli ? This phenomenon is not owing to the nature of the tis- sue, but to its greater abundance, since it is more striking in proportion as the medullary system predominates. Now, as this sympathises in all its affections, it imparts to them a degree of ra- pidity they are not possessed of in the compact tissue, where the medullary system is wanting. SECTION IV. Dev elopement. This membrane exists in the cartilaginous state in the centre of the long bones ; but then it ful- fils the office of the nutritive parenchyma; for the gelatine that is exhaled in it, and which being accumulated in a considerable quantity in its cel- lulae, gives to the bone a homogeneous appearance, and prevents it from being distinguished. Dur- ing the process of ossification, this substance is absorbed, and the medullary cavity is formed, theMEDULLARY SYSTEM. 138 medullary membrane remaining bare; the blood begins to circulate in the vessels, hitherto acces- sible only to white fluids, because its mode of organic sensibility is changed ; instead of admit- ting gelatine into its cellulee, it is marrow, and an- other fluid that fills them, a phenomenon that equally depends upon the change of organic sen- sibility. From this proceeds quite a new exterior, an organ new in appearance, whilst in reality it is not the organ that is changed, but the fluid it se- parates. A phenomenon nearly similar to this, is observed in the formation of callus, in which the portion of the medullary membrane correspond- ing to the fracture, is at first cartilaginous, subse- quently bony, and finally is restored to its primi- tive state. The marrow, however, does not begin to be ex- haled from the moment the blood circulates in the medullary tube, or rather when it commences, but I have found it quite different from what it will subsequently be in the adult. There is scarcely any proportion of oily substance, as we have seen in the medullary juice : 1st, it presents a mucilaginous and reddish aspect; pressed between the fingers, it leaves no oily impression, as in the adult, but a fluid like gelatine : 2dly, by comparing together the water, in which the marrow of both ages has separately undergone ebullition, innumerable small oily drops are not seen floating upon the former,139 Medullaky system. as they are upon the latter : 3dly, submitted to the action of caloric, the middle of a long bone gives out a considerable number of small oily drops, of a bluish aspect pleasing to the eye, and which are furnished by the marrow, that burns after having undergone fusion ; nothing similar to this is observed in the foetus : 4thly, it is sufficiently known that the taste of marrow in young animals, in veal, for instance, is quite different from that collected in the adult animal; in the former,it is flat and unsavoury. 5thly, I have noticed that the marrow in infants sooner putrefies, that it turns greenish, then black, when a fresh bone has been for some time kept in the open air. The smell of this putrefied marrow is very offensive. On the contrary, if we preserve for some time a bone of an adult stripped of the surrounding parts, the marrow will be found to turn rank, and of a deep yellow colour, in the same manner as every other fatty substance that has been kept. The action ot air on the medullary organ belonging to the early age, is very distinct from what it is in the subsequent stages of life. What is the fluid this organ especially separates in the foetus, and in the infant, and which is replaced by the oily sub- stance? It would be a very interesting subject of research. Is the lower class of society, that associates together the idea it forms of marrow with that of fat, by saying the child has no marrowMEDULLARY SYSTEM. 140 in its bones, acquainted with this phenomenon ? This absence of medullary fat in the foetus essen- tially distinguishes marrow from that substance, which, at that age, is already found in great abundance. Functions. The first and most essential use of the medullary organ, is to separate the marrow from the mass of the blood, by means of exhalation, for this or- gan is unprovided with glands; and then to return it to this fluid by absorption, after it has remained for some time in its reservoir. This twofold pheno- menon is similar to that produced in respect to the fat: whence we perceive that two very distinct orders of blood-vessels are also admitted into its tissue; to demonstrate them, however, is not in the power of anatomy. Does the activity of exhalation vary, according to exercise or rest, heat or cold, corpulency or emaciation? Although numerous conjectures have been produced in this respect, none have been supported by strict experiment. All we know is, that in consumption, dropsy, marasmus, and in general, in all states of the body in which general debility is carried to the extreme, by the gradual and progressive fall of the vital powers, the marrow, like every other fluid, like solids also,141 medullary system. loses its nature, its essential characters, its con- sistence, and assumes quite a different appearance, without, however, the medullary organ under- going any organic injury, without it being thick- ened. I have only observed this change in rick- ets ; the marrow in such diseases bears a mu- cilaginous, a gelatinous aspect, as that we ob- serve in the foetus, admitting of this distinction only, of the reddish hue caused in the early stage by the great number of blood vessels. The medullary membrane has a direct connexion with the nutrition of the bone, a connexion per- fectly elucidated by the beautiful experiments of Troja, from which it follows, that the destruction of this membrane causes the death of the bone, which is replaced by a new one, the periosteum acting in respect to the latter as a nutritive parenchyma. These experiments are generally tried, by sawing the head of a long bone, and by introducing into the medullary tube a red hot iron, that disorganizes every thing. Soon after the periosteum swells, becomes inflamed, and excessively sensible to the touch. This gra- dually becomes less, and inflammation subsides. A considerable quantity of gelatine permeates the internal lamellae of this membrane, which forms into a cartilaginous bag, with which the bone is envelop- ed. After a certain time that varies according to the class to which the animal submitted to the experi- ment belongs ; according also to its age, constitu-142 MEDULLARY SYSTEM. tion, and several other causes, the vascular system destroyed within the cavity, and wholly applied over the periosteum,deposits therein the calcareous substance intended for the bone. The bone with- in is a body unconnected with life, encompassed on all sides by a living body. In artificial ossifica- tions, there are then three very distinct periods. 1st, Swelling and inflammation of the periosteum. 2dly,The cartilaginous state of the internal lamellae of this membrane. 3dly, The state of perfect bone. Besides, the two last states are not so regular and distinct, nor so easily studied, as in natural os- sification. Is the medullary membrane indirectly intended to furnish a part of the synovia by a transudation of the marrow through the heads of the long bones? —the greatest part of authors have asserted it. The opinion we should entertain of these me- chanical transudations observed in dead bodies, but repugnant to the ascertained phenomena of vitality, is now sufficiently known; the follow- ing experiments, besides, will remove all manner of doubt in this respect. I have opened on the sides two long bones in one of the posterior limbs of a dog, so as to introduce a red hot iron, which having been repeatedly done, has com- pletely destroyed the two medullary systems: necrosis was an immediate result of this experi- ment; the articulation, however, interposed be-MEDULLARY SYSTEM. 143 tween the two diseased organs, and continued as before to be supplied with synovia; a circumstance that could not have taken place if a transudation of the marrow were necessary for the production of this fluid. Who is not perfectly aware, on the other hand, that in diseases that affect articula- tions, in which the marrow of the corresponding bones nearly always remain uninjured, and that in the diseases affecting the medullary organ, the nature of the synovia is by no means altered, as the fluid contained in its cellulse ?CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. The word cartilage has been employed in too vague a sense. In the general acceptation of the word, it is applied to bodies, the organization of which essentially differ. The gristle of the nose, and the cartilages of the articulating surfaces, bear but little resemblance to each other, and between these generalities a line of distinction should, then, be drawn. I have attempted it by dividing this system into two; the one includes the cartilages, properly so called ; the other, the fibro-cartilagin- ous substances, such as those interposed between the vertebrae, those of the middle of certain ar- ticulations, &c. As this is a compound of the cartilaginous and fibrous systems, I shall not treat of it until I have noticed the latter. After having thus restricted the sense of the word cartilage ; it conveys to us the idea of a hard substance, elastic, and of a whitish aspect, although it is really organized. This animal sub- stance is met with in various parts of the body; especially, 1st, in the articulating heads of the145 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. moveable bones ; 2dly, in the articulating surfaces of those characterized by want of motion ; 3dly, in the parieties of peculiar cavities, which it especially contributes to form ; such are the cartilages of the nasal partition, of the ribs, of the larynx, See. Hence proceed three distinct classes that present varieties, both in their forms, in their organiza- tion, Sec. ARTICLE I. Of the Forms of the Cartilaginous System. * / These forms vary according to the class to which the cartilages belong. SECTION i. Form of the Cartilages in the moveable Ar- ticulations. In every moveable articulation, each end of the bone is provided with a cartilage that encloses it; facilitating, by its smoothness, the motion of the two bones, which, on account of their hardness, would, in rubbing, experience too violent a shock. This reflects a considerable part of the motion, which thus becomes more extended ; by yielding a little, it moderates the effects of the violent shocks to which the limbs are \i VOL. II.CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 146 exposed, and thus removes the danger that attends them. / The general character of interior conformation peculiar to these cartilages, is to be constantly less thick than wide, but of a thickness proportionate with the width ; so that the cartilages of large ar- ticulations exceed two, three, and even four times in this respect, those of the less extensive articula- tions ; to mould themselves on the articulating forms, to present two surfaces, and one circumfer- ence. One of these surfaces adheres to the bone in so intimate a manner, that it may be fractured in any other part rather than in this. The uniting medium is not exactly known: it appears cer- tain, however, that the cartilage is not an exten- sion, a continuation of the cartilaginous paren- chyma of the bone, for the fibres of this parenchy- ma are not continued with those of the cartilages ; if this were actually the case, by depriving along and fresh bone, provided with its cartilage, of the calcareous phosphate it is impregnated with, this continuity would necessarily be observed ; the bone and the cartilage would no longer differ from each other. Now, I have constantly observed in this experiment, that acids separate the car- tilages from the surface of the bone, either wholly or by fragments. The cartilaginous fibres of the bone divested of their saline substance, are evidently seen to terminate in the convex surfaceCARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 147 encompassed by the cartilage ; there has been no such thing as a solution of continuity. In ge- neral, the aspect of the cartilaginous parenchyma, isolated from its earthy portion, is quite different from that of the real cartilage. This distinction, I presume, proceeds from the quantity of gelatine that is more considerable in the second than in the first. The action of acids, particularly that of the nitric, is the most advantageous means of separating a cartilage from the head of the bone ; maceration requires considerable time to produce this effect; in ebullition it is less apparent, because the gelatine is in a state of fusion. The surface of the cartilage opposed to the bone, is intimately united with the synovial mem- brane of the articulation. From this it derives the polish that characterizes it; for, wherever these substances do not correspond with this mem- brane, they lose that character, as we see in the larynx, in the'cartilages of the ribs, &c. Here the medium of adherence is a cellular tissue excessive- ly tight, that cannot be removed by^heets, by maceration, nor by dissection. As the synovial membrane is completely formed of this tissue, it appears, that over the cartilage, it is nothing more than an extension of that which, after having con- tributed to the contexture of that organ, is con- densated over its surface, and formed into a menu- brane. l 2148 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. The circumference of the cartilages we are viewing, terminates in an insensible manner over the bony surface, it dies away as it were, where the synovial membrane forsakes the bone to be reflected. The two corresponding cartilages of* a move- able articulation, are so completely disposed and moulded, the one upon the other, that in the mid- dle of the articulation they touch each other ex- actly in every direction. We all know that the central position of an articulation, is when the bone does not incline more in one direction than in the other ; and that all the muscles equally contracted, and presenting to each other an equal resistance, keep the limb equally distant from flexion and extension, from adduction and abduction, &c. &c. and forcibly maintain it in a precise medium. This is the position the limbs assume whenever muscular exertion is not commanded by the will; such, for instance, as in the foetus, during sleep, rest, &c. ; it is that also which is determined by certain convulsions, when all the muscles of a limb are agitated with equal force, by the extra- ordinary influence of the nerves, &c. In all other positions never is the contact of two articulating cartilages perfect in every part; some part of the surface of each presses more or less powerfully the parts adjacent to the articulation, and dis- tends them. The softness of the cartilaginous tissue renders this pressure more indurable ; theCARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 149 sensation of which would be painful in the ex- tensive motions, if the bones preserved their so- lidity at the end of the lever they represent. The forms of the cartilages we are examining, besides these general characters, have others that are peculiar to each kind of moveable articula- tion. 1st. In the first genus, the convex crust that covers the head of the bone is thick in the centre, and very thin in the circumference. An inverse disposition is observed in the concave part that receives the insertion ; frequently, even as in the humerus, in the femur, the thickness is increased at the circumference by a cushion-like fibro-cartilage. In this manner the effort is unequally borne in the different parts by one or other of the cartilages, but the uniformity of the contact is secured. 2dly. In the second genus, that differs from the first, by its being deprived of the motion of rota- tion, as a convexity is generally received into a concavity, the disposition is nearly the same for the two cartilages. However, if two convex sur- faces glide the one over the other, as the condyle of the jaw, and the transverse apophysis afford instances of, then the cartilage gradually decreases in the circumference of each, but an inter-ar-> ticulating cartilage, thin in the middle, thick in the circumference, supplies the deficiency, and establishes in every point a contact which, with-150 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. out this interference, could only have existed in the centre. 3dly. In the third genus, the cartilaginous layer that lines the projections and depressions on the ends of two bones that are reciprocally opposed to each other, are found nearly of an uniform thickness, as is seen in the elbow, the knee, &c. so that the pressure bears equally upon the whole articulating surface. 4thly. In the fourth and fifth genera, the carti- laginous crusts moulded over the surfaces of the bones, display also nearly the same thickness in every part. I have found that on the bones of an adult, this thickness was nearly a line and a half in the articulation of the radius and ulna, the atlas and occiput, one line in the carpal and me- tacarpal articulations. SECTION II. Forms of the Cartilages of immoveable Articulations. Th e cartilages are met with in two kinds of im- moveable articulations only, namely, in those with surfaces in juxta-position, and those with indented surfaces. They form in each a layer remarkably slight, continued with the two bones that articu- late together, arising from their bony part, simi- lar to that above described, of the same nature, and151 cartilaginous system. forming a uniting medium which becomes firmer as age advances. In the head these kinds of cartilages are consi- derably multiplied ; those of the skull are thicker on the convex than in the concave surface ; from this it follows that the sutures sooner disappear in the latter case than in the former. Wherever they are seen they contribute to unite bones that form cavities : hence, as we have already said, they are less endangered by external injury, the effort being partly lost in their soft tissue, produces less effect than if the cavity were formed of one solid bone. It appears that these cartilages have much more affinity with the phosphate of lime than those of the moveable articulations, that sel- dom admit of ossification, whilst in an advanced age these always become bony ; instances of which are produced in the skull. 1 have remarked, however, that the cartilages of indented surfaces have a greater tendency to ossification, than those of surfaces in juxta-position; at least, it is a more common thing to see the parietal bones united with the occipital and the coronal, than to find an union of the maxillary, the palatine, bones, &c. SECTION III. Forms of the Cartilages of the Cavities. The cartilages of the cavities adopt two diffe- rent forms, according to the parts they contributeCARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 152 to form. They are; 1st. Long, as in the ribs; 2dly. Flat, as in the larynx, the nasal partitions, &c. Externally they are all lined with a fibrous mem- brane, similar to the periosteum, and in which se- veral muscles are implanted. To investigate this membrane properly, the cartilage should undergo maceration for a day or two : it then becomes visibly white, and thereby its thickness, and the direction of its fibres, &c. are rendered very evi- dent. The cartilages of cavities do not display the numerous apertures that are remarked in the bones, because the blood-vessels do not penetrate them. Few eminences, and few depressions are observed in them ; besides, their forms cannot al- together be viewed in a general light, because each being intended for very different purposes, they have but little analogy with each other, ARTICLE II. Organization of the Cartilaginous System. An organic texture can hardly be admitted in the interior of a cartilage ; it really exists, how- ever, and is composed of a proper and a common tissue.CARTILAGINOUS system. 153 SECTION I. Tissue proper to the Cartilaginous System. The proper cartilaginous tissue presents a plexus of fibres so closely interwoven, that at first it appears completely homogeneous, and formed by a mass of gelatine without any particular or- der or direction. However, with more attention, longitudinal fibres are observed, crossed by others in a transverse sense. Th ese fibres are more apparent in the cartilages at the ends of the moveable bones than in the others. They have infinitely less suppleness than the fibres of the fibro-cartilaginous substances: thus the latter admit of being bent without being parted, whilst the former will snap at the least attempt; the ruptured part is constantly smooth, and displays no unevenness. The cartilaginous tissue is remarkable for a num- ber of characteristics that distinguish it from all others. Except the tissue of the bone, none will resist putrefaction and maceration so long a time as this. In a corpse completely putrefied, this tissue is found almost entirely sound, retaining its appearance, its texture, and frequently even its natural whiteness. I have kept in water for a long space of time cartilaginous substances that were no ways affected by it, except in their co- lour, as I shall state. More than a year would154 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. probably be required to reduce them to that soft, mucous, and liquid pulp, to which the greatest part of organs are brought by maceration. The cartilaginous tissue, like every other, con- tracts when exposed to great heat; this pheno- menon, however, is not observed in the thyroid cartilage on account of its thickness, and in the cartilages that cover the bones, on account of their adherence with these organs; but if the former be divided into thin lamellae, and the latter be removed in slices, and immersed in boiling water, they instantly contract strongly. On becoming dry, the cartilaginous tissue assumes a yellowish hue, a semi-transparency similar to that of tendons and ligaments that have undergone the same preparation; it contracts, is reduced in volume, and deprived of its elasticity in propor- tion as it hardens. By ebullition, this substance also acquires a yel- lowish hue, then over the articulary heads it cracks and splits in several places, it drops off in sheets that are softened, and is finally reduced nearly to a complete state of fusion,- excepting only a small residue, which does not appear to be of a gelatinous nature. The softening of the cartilaginous substance by boiling water, renders it more fit than it is in the natural state to be dissolved by the gastric juices. Swallowed raw, cartilages remain a long time in the stomach, whilst they are very quickly digested, being155 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. boiled; this is one of the most essential advan- tages derived from boiling. In several experi- ments upon digestion, I have found in the sto- mach of dogs parts of cartilages completely un- affected, whilst the fleshy parts were already re- duced into a pulp. In particular cases the cartilaginous tissue is astonishingly altered; in the diseases of the arti- culation of the hip, it assumes quite a different aspect 5 the cotyloid cavity is filled with a soft substance, larded, as it were, disclosing very dis- tinct vessels, and sometimes very striking fibres, exceeding in size twice, nay, four times their natural state. I have observed, that in this case, those fibres do not become yellow, and are not reduced to fu- sion by ebullition, consequently that they are no longer cartilaginous. In the same diseases I have found the cartila- ginous tissue over the femur and the os ilium, not only ossified, but even converted into a sub- stance similar in every respect to ivory. I pos- sess two of these productions. When the cartilages undergo ossification, a substance analogous to cancelli is formed in the middle, where the decussating fibres leave be- tween them very distinct spaces, in which a kind of medullary juice even is deposited. This obser- vation is particularly applicable to those of the ca- vities of the larynx, of the chest, &c.CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM, 156 SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Cartilaginous System. The cartilages contain cellular tissue, although, from the want of space between their fibres in the natural state, it cannot be ascertained without di culty ; in fact, the formation of granulations in the wounds in which they are concerned, and ebullition, which, after having deprived them of gelatine, leaves a membranous and cellular resi- due, sufficiently prove the existence of this sub- stance, disclosed, besides in a very conspicuous manner by particular pathological states, in which gelatine, less abundantly separated in car- tilages, has ceased to provide them with their ha- bitual degree of solidity, leaving a soft and fre- quently a spongy tissue. No blood-vessels can be distinguished in these fibres. They are supplied by the exhalant sys- tem, with white fluids only ; but as this system is continued with the arteries of the adjacent parts, the moment its organic sensibility is exalted by morbid causes, and that by these means it becomes connected with the red globules of the blood, it is also disclosed; these globules penetrate it with fa- cility, and hence the red aspect w hich cartilages then display, seen in inflammation, wounds, &c. It is the very same phenomenon that is observed when the157 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. conjunctiva is inflamed, &c. As soon as the cause of irritation has subsided, sensibility is restored to its natural type, and on that account the red glo- bules become heterogeneous substances with re- spect to the cartilages, which re-assume their na- tural whiteness. The nature of the white fluids that are com- monly circulated by the vascular system of the cartilages is not ascertained. These fluids have a strong tendency to become the vehicle for the propagation of bile, at least for the colouring substance of that fluid, when, as in jaundice, it is diffused throughout the animal economy. In this disease the cartilages, like all other parts, are al- most invariably found tinged with yellow; this colour is more striking on their surfaces than in their tissue, although it is very conspicuous there. On opening a moveable articulation, the appear- ance is generally as striking as on the skin; be- sides, all parts which, like these in the natural state, receive but few red globules, or none at all, are also very evidently tinged. The tendons, the tunica conjunctiva, the internal membrane of the arteries, are instances of this. In two different subjects in whom the middle part of the thyroid cartilages were ossified, I have observed that the yellow colour was much deeper in the ossified than in the cartilaginous part. I am not aware that nerves have been traced in the cartilages.CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 158 ARTICLE III. Properties of the Cartilaginous System. SECTION i. Physical Properties. * Elasticity is a property generally extended to every organic and inorganic body. Amongst the former, it appears that vegetables are endowed with that property in a greater number of their organs than animals. In the latter, nearly all the parts are soft, a few only admitting of re-action after having been bent or compressed. Amongst these parts, cartilages in man hold the first rank ; their elasticity is very conspicuous, particularly in the adult, in whom their consistence holds the medium between the softness that characterizes them in infancy, and their rigidity in old age. These two last properties, in fact, are not at all favourable to elasticity. If the blade of a scalpel be thrust into a carti- lage, the two edges of the division will re-act upon it and repel the offensive instrument. Pressed against a resisting form, the cartilaginous end of a long bone becomes flattened, and re- assumes its primitive shape as soon as the cause of compression is removed. In the operation of bronchotomy, the thyroid cartilage divided in its longitudinal direction, abruptly brings to- gether its divided surfaces. The section of the159 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. cricoid cartilage produces a similar phenomenon : pressed against the sides of the abdomen, the car- tilages of the lower ribs re-assume their former position, &c. &c. All these phenomena are evidently the result of the elastic power. Thus has nature always placed cartilages where, to answer particular pur- poses, it is requisite that the physical should be associated with the vital powers; as in the larynx, and in the nasal partition, to produce a kind of vi- bration in the passage of air ; in the ends of the ribs, to support that kind of tortion indispensable to mechanical respiration ; in the articulating extremities, to paralyze the effects of external violence. It appears that vital activity gives this pro- perty more energy, although it still remains very apparent after death. I presume the cartilages are indebted for this, to the great quantity of ge- latine they contain. 1st, It is sufficiently known that this substance is possessed of it in the highest degree, as is proved by the shaking of jellies that are coagulated by cold, by the inspection of dif- ferent animal glues, &c. 2dly, If by ebullition the cartilages are deprived of this substance, the nutritive parenchyma remains flabby and soft. 3dly, In proportion as organs are deprived of ge- latine, their elasticity is diminished, as is seen by studying the decay of this property in cartilages, wherein it predominates; in the fibro-cartilagin-160 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. ous organs where it is found in a smaller propor- tion, and in the fibrous bodies that contain still less. We must acknowledge, however, that nu- merous bodies, essentially gelatinous, give but in- different signs of elasticity : the skin is an instance of this, and tendons also display a similar disposi- tion : how happens it that the same substance may, accordingly as it has been differently elaborated by the organic powers, become the seat of quite opposite properties ? section II. Properties of the Tissue. Cartilages are, perhaps, amongst all other organs, those in which the extensibility and con- tractility of the tissue are the least developed. They are veryseldom found to distend, to length- en, and they sooner part. Diseases do not dis- close to us, in the larynx, those dilatations so fre- quently met with in other cavities, even in those of a bony conformation. Far from separating, as in the skin, in a muscle, &c., the edges of their sections are drawn together, as we have seen, by the effects of elasticity : one might think this last property is accumulated therein, to the detriment of the tissue. I161 CA RTILAGINOUS SYSTRM. SECTION III. Vital Properties. \ / The vital properties also are rather obscure in this system. - In the natural state, animal sensibili- ty is never to be met with ; it is only when in- flammation, or some irritating cause, has exalted their organic sensibility, a sensibility unavoid- ably implied by the functions that are performed ; it is only then, I say, the brain painfully perceives the different irritations that are seated in these organs. This is demonstrated particularly by the heterogeneous bodies that are formed in the arti- culations, which may, or may not, be injured by their presence, accordingly as their position irri- tates the cartilaginous heads, or does not interfere with them. Cartilages do not possess animal or sensible or- ganic contractility, but merely insensible organic contractility or tone, and that even in rather an obscure degree. Sympathies are very obscure, or almost want- ing in this system. I have never heard that by the acute affections of the different organs, the sympathetic phenomenon of sensibility or con- tractility has ever been observed in cartilages. They remain undisturbed amidst the general trouble that affects the other systems in these kinds of diseases. Even in chronic affections they ex- VOL. II. M162 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. perience little alteration ; for instance, if we only compare the corpse of an individual that has suffered violent death, whose organs have remain- ed uninjured, and that of a consumptive, dropsi- cal, or cancerous subject, &c., we shall find, be- tween nearly all the organs of the one, and those of the other, a very striking distinction : the as- pect of the muscles, of the mucous and serous sur- faces, of the vessels, of the nerves, &c., is com- pletely changed by the slow alteration they have undergone in the latter; but amidst all these al - terations, the cartilages have hardly undergone any; their aspect is nearly the same as in their natural state. Characters of the Vital Properties. From what has just been stated, it will be con- ceived that cartilages do not possess much vital activity ; that every morbid phenomenon must, in these organs, be characterized by a remarkably slow progress ; that inflammation, for instance, must, as in bones, assume a chronic type. The following experiment clearly establishes this point. If a cartilage be laid completely bare, divided, and then brought in contact with apart of a muscle, of the skin, &c., that has also been divided, union will not be effected, or at least will require a considerable lapse of time. Why ? Because the vitality of the muscle or of the skin,163 c A R TI L A GIN O U S S Y 8 T E M. being much more active than that of '.the carti- lages, the inflammation of the former organs will be much more rapid than that of the latter; that con- sequently the first inflammatory period of the one will answer to the last of the others. Now, the re- union is easier in proportion as the inflammatory periods in the two divided parts in contact, cor- respond. This explains why two parts of the same organ are much sooner united, than two sur- faces proceeding from different organs; why, the greater analogy there is in the degree of vitality of two distinct organs, the less difficulty will attend the union ; why the difficulty is in- creased in proportion as the distinctions in vitality become more striking. Two surfaces of bones in perfect contact will require thirty or forty days to effect their reunion ; the same phenomenon is accomplished in the lips of a cutaneous division, in the course of two or three days. If we intend to conjoin two organs so very dissimilar in their mode of cicatrization, by bringing them in con- tact, we shall succeed but slowly. If the bony end of an amputated stump be covered with the skin, the latter begins to sup- purate when the bone has scarcely softened : thus skilful practitioners have completely laid aside these pretended unions by the first intention subsequent to amputation, and which have been so much extolled. These unions would un- doubtedly take place, if the vitality of the or- M 2164 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. gans that contribute to form these parts were the same ; but the difference in the muscular, bony, tendinous, cellular, and nervous organs, &c., al- ways requires a considerable length of time, be- fore an equilibrium, as it were, is established, and the divided ends of these organs are ag- glutinated. I have already observed that the division of in inflammation into acute and chronic, is incorrect, because the duration of the inflammatory phenomena in the organs, is completely relative to their mode of vitality. An inflammation of the cellular tissue of the skin, assumes an acute type, when it lasts only a few days; and a chronic one when it exceeds forty or fifty. Now, in a cartilage, this last term may characterize an acute inflammation, whilst a succession of several months is required for a chronic one; instances of which are so frequently met with in diseases of the articu- lations. The natural functions, as well as the morbid affections, partake of this retarded mode of pro- gress in the vital phenomena of cartilages ; their habitual motion of composition and decomposi- tion, their nutrition being slowly performed, the nutritive substances require much time to be com- bined with them. I am convinced that in ani- mals suddenly killed by carbonic acid, the mus- cles, the glands, the membranes, &c., which are almost instantly infected by the contagious prin-165 CAR riLAGINOUS SYSTEM. eiples, and prove such pernicious food ; I am con- vinced, I say, that these fatal principles not hav- ing' yet penetrated the cartilages, these might be digested without danger. To the slowness of the motion of decomposition, must be attributed the re-solution of congestions in cartilages; for tumours are resolved by the same laws by which our organs are decomposed, as they are formed by the laws that preside over their composition. Cartilages, and similar organs, in respect to their mode of vitality, are to the other parts of the economy, what the zoophites and other animals possessed of capillary circulation only, are to ani- mals better organized, to those possessed of ge- neral circulation, to those provided with a heart of two ventricles. As much as life ge- nerally considered, varies in activity in the se- ries of animals, so much it will differ, when studied separately in every individual organ of each species. ARTICLE IV. Developement of the Cartilaginous System. The system of the bones, and that of the car- tilages, are confused together in the embryo ; in proportion as the first expands, the second con- tracts; the latter actually has gelatine for its prin- cipal basis. I shall not enter into a repetition of166 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. the proofs by which it was demonstrated, when the system of the bones was considered. In speaking of that system, I have pointed out how the cellular and vascular parenchymae primi- tively formed, and constituting the mucous state, are subsequently permeated with this basis; this is what forms the cartilage. The original mode, then, of the formation of this system of organs, is already investigated ; let us now consider in what manner its developement is continued. * SECTION I. State of the Cartilaginous System in the Early Age. Tn proportion as the bone becomes ossified, and this organ is consequently more sparingly sup- plied with gelatine, this substance seems to flow with more abundance over the articulating sur- faces ; for the cartilages that cover these parts lose their primitive softness, assuming a degree of consistence that gradually increases. Much more gelatine, however, disappears from within the bones, than what is absorbed by the cartilages; so that it might be said, this substance gradually de- creases in the organs, as we advance in age. We are perfectly aware it is the parts of young ani- mals that are selected to make glue, jellies, &c. The articulating cartilages display at that period a phenomenon I have repeatedly ascertained in my experiments: when they have undergone167 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. maceration in water for the space of three or four days, they assume a very deep red colour. This hue does not penetrate very far; but if the carti- lage be divided in several parts, so as to expose more surface to the contact of the fluid, it will become completely red. The cartilages of ossi- fication display a similar phenomenon, that be- comes less striking as age advances ; so that in the greater part of adults the cartilages preserve their white appearance in maceration. In some individuals, however, they are still of a light pink, but it is not so deep as in the foetus. From what can this phenomenon proceed ? Does the water contain the cause of this colouration, or does this fluid rob the cartilage, by solution of cer- tain substances that prevent this phenomenon from being produced ? Whatever it may be, none of the articulating organs will redden in this manner ; all, on the contrary,—the synovial mem- brane, the ligaments, &c. become whiter. In general, there is no line of distinction drawn, in a sensible manner, at least, between the carti- lage intended for ossification, and that designed to remain such. Sometimes, however, a tarnished hue is observed in the ends of bones ; but these reddish streaks so frequently found irregularly disseminated in the cartilages for ossification, are never seen. As long as the process of ossification continues,CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 168 a very striking vascular layer is interposed be. tween the cartilage and the bony substance al- ready formed ; these two parts, united by a slight adherence only, are easily separated. Upon the surface of each, after being removed, different asperities, projections, and depressions, that in- dent with each other, are also observed. The want of adherence between these two bony and cartilaginous portions, before ossification is com- pleted, has probably given rise to all that has been said in respect to the separation of the epiphysis, —a phenomenon very seldom ascertained by the observations of our present surgeons. In proportion as the calcareous phosphate reaches the extremity of the bone, the vessels dis- appear, and the adhesions become more perfect. Finally, ossification being completed, on the one hand, an evident vascular net is no longer observed between the cartilage and the bone, and on the other, their adherence is such that their disjunction is almost impossible. These two characters espe- cially distinguish the connection of the cartilage of ossification with the bone, from that of the real cartilage with the same bone. I have also ob- served, that most generally, and above its union with the ossified part, the cartilage of ossification is not so white, and displays a deeper hue, ex- tending to the distance of the sixth or fourth part of an inch, and which is sometimes very striking ;CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 169 it is a forerunner of the approach of the blood. This disposition is completely unconnected with the cartilage which covers the bone in the adult. The absence of ossification of the cartilages of moveable articulations, is commonly attributed to the articulating motions ; but I think it pro- ceeds solely from the laws relating to the nutri- tion of bones. Here nature has placed the limits for the exhalation of the calcareous phosphate, as she has also restricted to the origin of a tendon, the exhalation of the fibrine, for the correspond- ing muscle; it is because the mode of organic sensibility changes, and that the vessels of the cartilage are no further connected with the red part of the blood, nor with the earthy substance. In fact, in admitting as real the preceding hy- pothesis, where would be the necessity of carti- lages in the immoveable articulations ? Why should they exist ? Why should motion, that elsewhere promotes exhalation and secretion, in this case prevent the former ? Why should unna- tural ossification take place in the most move- able parts, of which we find a striking instance in arteries ? Why, again, in peculiar cases of anchy- losis, in which the articulating surfaces unite to- gether, and motion is lost, are the cartilages not destroyed ? The cartilages intended for cavities possess a mode of origin, of developement, and of nutri- tion, perfectly similar to that of the articulatingCARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 170 cartilages. I have observed a distinction in their tissues, as well as in the tissue of the latter, in re- spect to that of the cartilages of ossification, inas- much as the latter are overrun with several greyish lines not produced in the others. Whenever the cartilages for ossification are divided in any di- rection, their divided surfaces present several small dots, that are the divided ends of these ves- sels, which, although they do not yet circulate blood, contain a fluid of a much darker hue than that of the cartilaginous tissue. SECTION If. State of the Cartilaginous System, in the subsequent Ages. In proportion as age advances, the cartilages grow harder, stronger, and less elastic. Gela- tine, chiefly intended for their nutrition, assumes a particular character; for it is sufficiently known, that the glues extracted from young animals are much superior to those proceeding from aged ones. The difference between a calf’s foot and that of an ox, in preparing jellies, is well understood in the kitchen. This distinction in the substance, of which cartilages are essentially composed, and which undoubtedly constitutes their nutritive elements, sufficiently proves that it does not always remain in these organs, but is therein habituallv exhaled and absorbed, in the171 CARTILAGINOUS system. same manner as the earthy substance in the bone, the fibrine in the muscles, &c5 &c. In the latter years of life, ossification invades every cartilage, but begins in a reverse sense with those of the cavities, and with those belonging to the articulations. In the former, it originates in the centre; in the latter, on the surface that cor- responds to the bone :—it is in general more tardy in these, and particularly in the moveable than in the immoveable articulations. The cartilages of the larynx and of the ribs are ossified in their centres, from the age of thirty-six to forty, and even prior to this; this state, after that period, gradually increases, so much so, that in old age the section of the thyroid cartilage is attended with much difficulty. In a great num- ber of operations in which I have directed the stu- dent’s hand, I have constantly had occasion to convince myself, that after sixty, the knife com- monly in use was, in nearly every instance, insuffi- cient to effect the section, and that it required one more highly tempered. The ossification of the costal cartilages prevent the aged subject from performing any longer those considerable efforts of inspiration so common in youth ; with them it is chiefly the diaphragm that acts. I also attri- bute to this premature ossification in the cartilages of cavities, a state constantly attended with a de- velopement of the vascular system, the much greater frequency of caries in this species of carli-CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 172 lages, than in any other. I cannot explain why in the larynx, the arytsenoid cartilages are the most liable to this affection ; but on dissection, I found it a constant fact; every affection of the larynx, attended with caries, that I have observed in dead bodies, have afforded instances of it. SECTION III. Accidental Development of the Cartilaginous System. V The cartilaginous system, as well as that of the bones, is frequently developed in organs with which it is naturally unconnected, but with this distinction, that this phenomenon, with regard to the former, is the effect of age, whilst in the latter, it can only proceed from a morbid cause. Nothing is more common than to find cartilagi- nous knobs in schirrous, cancerous tumours, &c.; in the midst of those frequent morbid productions in which our parts assume a greasy aspect; in ob- structions of the lungs or liver, &c. I cannot conceive why the proper membrane of the spleen has so great a tendency to be impregnated with gelatine ; it is, of all the organs, that in which accidental cartilages are the most fre- quently produced. Generally it is by irregular blades these cartilaginous productions are formed ; sometimes this production invades the whole membrane, which then presents a convex surface, *173 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. analogous to those of the moveable articulations that are enveloped by the periosteum, in the same manner as these are covered by the synovial mem- brane. Can the spleen thus outwardly become cartilaginous, admit of changes in its volume? Of this I know nothing. The moveable, and frequently the free cartilaginous productions in the articulations, are sufficiently known. Do they proceed from the ossification of a part of the sy- novial membrane ? I presume this is the case ; for they have frequently been seen adhering to the cartilage by membranous extensions. Last year I observed in a corpse, that a portion of the synovial membrane proceeding from the mass of adipose matter, situate behind the patella, and passing to the notch that separates the condyles of the femur, was almost completely cartilaginous ; if during life it had been loosened by the effect of the mo- tions, it would have formed one of those move- able and free cartilages. Besides, as I have only this individual fact to produce on this head, I can present nothing else but conjectures ; and still more so, because the synovial and the serous mem- branes, as is perfectly shown, are of a similar na- ture, and the latter very seldom become cartila- ginous. These kinds of productions also, exactly follow the common course of ossification ;—cartilaginous at first, and unprovided with any blood-vessel, they soon disclose, if not recently formed, aCARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 174 I red centre, then a bony substance radiating from the centre to the circumference, and which some- times terminates completely invading the carti- lage ; so that they form real bones. This last circumstance, however, is very rare. The state in which these productions have most generally been found, is that in which they were ossified in the centre, and cartilaginous in the circumference. I have met with one in the articulations of the os pisiforme with the os pyramidale, the size of the head of a large pin, and the whole of which was harder than ivory.FIBROUS SYSTEM, Anatomists have not viewed the fibrous or- gans in a general light; none have yet formed of them a system separate from the parts in which they are found : they can afford in the actual state of the science, none of those important views so useful to the practice of physic, that dis- play to us each organ resulting from the combi- nation of different systems, the analogy of which we find in the other organs, so that, although very distinct in respect to their functions, these parts are liable to the same diseases, because simr lar systems contribute in their structure. Two years ago I presented several general ob- servations on the fibrous membranes that have paved the way ; but these membranes are only a division of the fibrous system that should be here considered more at large. ARTICLE I. Forms, and Divisions of the Fibrous System. Although all the fibrous organs are absolutely of a similar nature, although the same fibres con-FIBIIOUS SYSTKM. 170 tribute, to the composition of all, the forms which they assume vary in an astonishing degree ; it is this variety of forms, in common with that of their situations, and of their functions, that has caused them to be differently denominated and designated by the names of tendons, aponeuroses, ligaments, &c. for here there is no general deno- mination for the whole system, a word for in- stance, that will answer to those of muscle, nerve, &c. which in the muscular and nervous system, See. convey the idea of the organization, whatever it may be. This word I shall not form, as I shall be easily understood without it: All the fibrous forms may be referred to two general ones; the one is disposed like the mem- branous, the other in bundles. In the former these organs are wide and thin ; they are thicker in the latter. Thus the muscles, the nerves, even the very bones, alternately present this disposition in their conformation; as is seen in the retina, when compared with the nerves formed of fila- ments ; in the muscular coat of the stomach, of the intestines, on being compared with the muscles of locomotion, in the bones of the skull, compared with those of the limbs. SECTION i. Fibrous Organs of a Membranous Form. Tiie fibrous organs disposed in membranes are; 1st. The fibrous membranes properly soFIBKOUS SYSTEM. 177 called 5 2dly. The fibrous capsules; 3dly. The tendinous sheaths ; 4thly. The aponeuroses. 1st. The fibrous membranes include the perios- teum, the dura-mater, the tunica sclerotica, the tunica albuginea, the proper membranes of the kidneys, of the spleen, &c. &c. They are generally intended to cover certain organs, to the texture of which they contribute.. 2dly. The fibrous capulses, very different, as we shall see, from the synovial surfaces, are a kind of cylindrical bags that are found round some articu- lations, especially round those of the femur and the humerus, which they connect with the sca- pula and the ilium, by inclosing both their arti- culating surfaces. 3dly. The fibrous sheaths are intended to fix the tendons on their crossing over the bones, where they undergo flexion, and generally in all parts in which, by the contraction of the muscles, they are liable to deviate, and thus transmit but imperfectly the motion they receive from these organs. They may be divided into two species ; some receive and transmit the united tendons of several muscles, as those observed in the wrist, the footstep, &c. ; others, like those of the fingers, are intended for an isolated tendon, or for two only. 4thly. The aponeuroses are a kind of fibrous canvas, more or less extensive, always connected with locomotion, and disposed in such a manner > vol. n. NFIBROUS SYSTEM. 178 that sometimes they form coverings for different parts, at other times they provide the muscles with points of insertion : hence the aponeuroses for envelopement, and those for origin or in- sertion ; each of these are divided into two species. The aponeuroses for envelopement are placed sometimes round a muscle, to which they form a general sheath, as is seen in the thigh, in the fore arm, &c.; at other times they are seen covering certain muscles which they in part retain in their respective situations, as that which proceeds from the serratus posticus superior, to the serratus posticus inferior, as the abdominal aponeurosis, or again, as that situate behind the soleus, behind the deep muscles of the leg, &c. The aponeuroses for insertions sometimes dis- play more or less extended surfaces, as in the origins of the triceps adductor fern oris, of the rectus femoris, of the gemelli, &c. ; at other times fibres separate from each other, and give insertion by each of these fibres to a fleshy one, as at the superior insertion of the iliac, of the anterior tibial, &c. Finally, they sometimes form arches, and then they at the same time give insertion to muscles, and suffer vessels to pass under them, as in the diaphragm, the soleus, &c. SECTION II. Fibrous Organs formed in Fasciculi, These organs are ; 1st. The tendons ; 2d. The ligaments.179 FIBROUS SYSTEM. FIBROUS ORGANS. 1st. The tendons are found at the origin, at the insertion, and in the middle of muscles; they are either single in the form of extended strings, as in the peronei, the tibials, and in almost every muscle ; or compound, as in the rectus femors, the flexors, &c. 2d. The ligaments secure the cartilaginous or bony articulations round which they are placed ; they are formed of regular fasciculi, as the lateral ligaments of the elbow, of the knee, of the jaw, &c. or of irregular fasciculi, as those of the pelvis, A single glance at the following table, will be sufficient to represent the classification I have just pointed out for the fibrous organs. &c SECTION III Table of the Fibrous System 'Fibrous membranes.

N 2FIBROUS SYSTEM. 180 Although the numerous organs that are in- cluded in this classification belong to very dif- ferent processes; although they seem dissemi- nated here and there in the economy, without \ being in any way connected together ; although each appears isolated, yet they are nearly all con- tinued and held together, so that the fibrous system might be considered like the vascular and the nervous cerebral systems ; that is to say, as having a common centre from which the different organs that form its divisions radiate. This common centre of the fibrous system ap- pears to me to be the periosteum. I do not mean that similar to the heart or to the brain, it exerts any influence upon the organs that proceed from it, but that anatomical inspection discloses to us all the fibrous organs as closely connected with it, and communicating together by its means. The following observations will afford the proofs of it. 1st. Amongst the fibrous membranes, that of the corpus cavernosum interweaves with the pe- riosteum above the ischium ; the dura-mater is continued with it through the foramina at the basis of the skull. In uniting by the lamella that attends the optic nerve with the sclerotic tunic, it joins to it this membrane, between both of which it remains interposed; 2dly. Every fibrous capsule interweaves with the periosteum above and below the articulation ; 3dly. Wherever are fibrous sheaths, their fibres intermix with its181 FIBROUS SYSTEM. own ; 4thly. All the aponeuroses, either for en - velopement or for insertion, disclose similar in- terweavings ; 5thly. The tendons, by their ex- tensions, are every where confounded with this membrane ; 6th. In the two ends of the filaments it unites its fibres with theirs ; the tunica albuginea, the perichondrium of the larynx, the membranes of the spleen and kidneys only, form exceptions to this general rule. The fibrous system then must be conceived in a general manner; that is to say, as every where extended ; belonging at the same time to a number of organic processes, distinct in each by its form, but continued with the greatest number, having communications every where. This maimer of viewing it will appear still more natural, when we consider that the periosteum, or general abut- ■ ment for the divers parts of this system, is itself everywhere continued, and that in those parts wherein it is separated by an articulation, the fibrous capsules and ligaments are, as has been stated, the means of union. From this use of the periosteum in respect to the fibrous system, the advantage derived from its situation over the bones, that affords it and the organs with which it communicates, a firm support, is easily conceived.FIBROUS SYSTEM. 182 ARTICLE XT. Organization of the Fibrous System. In the numerous varieties of forms we have just been examining, the general organization of the fibrous organs is nearly always the same. I shall now consider this organization, and after- wards the varieties it undergoes in each part will be treated of. It results from the assemblage of a peculiar tissue with the vascular and cellular systems, &c. SECTION i. Peculiar Tissue of the Organization of the Fibrous System. Every fibrous organ is provided for its basis with a fibre of a peculiar nature, hard, rather elastic, insensible, hardly admitting of contracti- lity, sometimes in juxta-position, and assembled together parallel to each other, as in the ten- dons, the ligaments; at other times intersected in various directions, as in the membranes, the capsules, the fibrous sheaths, &c.; but every where the same ; every where displaying a whitish or greyish hue, and a very remarkable degree of resistance. This resistance of the fibrous tissue, renders every organ it composes fit to resist the utmost efforts ; thus is every one of these organs intended for uses that require this faculty. The ligaments183 FIBROUS SYSTEM. strongly retain together their articulating surfaces. The aponeuroses retain the muscles together and prevent their displacement. The tendons inces- santly exposed to the contraction of these organs, are every instant placed between the energetic power they represent, and the more or less re- sistance offered by the extremity of the muscles, &c. Such is this resistance, that it frequently proves superior even to that of the very bone itself. We are aware, that by the muscular exertions, the patella, the olecranon, and the os calcis, are sometimes fractured. Now this would not be the case if the tissue of the exterior ten- dons that correspond with these different bones, exposed to contraction, were more easily lace- rated. To that resisting power the following pheno- mena must be referred; 1st. Luxations in the corpse are produced with the utmost difficulty, particularly in the articulations commonly called enarthrodial; 2dly. In the living subject, exter- nal mechanical efforts are seldom sufficient to produce them ; they require a powerful muscular action; 3dly. The punishment formerly in use, by which criminals were drawn in quarters by four horses, was so much the more cruel, that the resistance opposed by the ligaments prolonged the duration of the agony ; in almost every instance the powers of the horses pro ved ineffectual to tear the limbs asunder, and the knife was used to184 FIBROUS SYSTEM. complete the barbarous deed. Weights suspend- ed to a tendon, will never part them, except when they are very enormous: thus the best cordage that could be used in manufactories, would be those twisted with animal fibres, if these organs were not robbed of their softness and flexibility by desiccation; if humidity did not vitiate them, &c. ; 5thly, an aponeurosis cannot be lacerated without the greatest force, especially those which are rather thick, as the fascia-lata, the tunica albuginea, the dura-mater, &e. This resistance, however, is occasionally over- powered in the living subject, and surgical prac- tice sometimes affords instances, in which the tendons of the soleus, of the plantaris, of the ex- tensors of the thigh, &c. But how does it hap- pen, that the tissue of a softer muscle never gives way, while that of a much denser tendon is rup- tured ? It proceeds from the fleshy fibres being constantly in such cases in a state of contraction ; consequently far from being distended, as the tendinous fibres, which then are in a passive state as it were, their divers parts exert their powers to draw nearer to each other ; and, in fact, they succeed, which gives to the muscle a density, and hardness equal, and even in some cases, much su- perior to those of their tendons ; as may be ob- served by placing the hand over a contracted muscle. As a further proof, these kind of rup- tures proceed from the cause I have pointed out,185 FIBROUS SYSTEM. is, that if in a corpse, a weight be suspended to a muscle detached at one end from the bone, the fleshy and not the tendinous part will be ruptured. The fibrous tissue has been considered by some anatomists, as being nearly of the same nature as the muscular tissue, and even as being some- times a continuation of it. Thus, it has been said? that the tendon merely resulted from an assem- blage of the fleshy fibres, which, without chang- ing their nature, were only deprived of their hue. Thus, the aponeuroses for envelopement, have been considered as formed by the pressure of the surrounding bodies upon the exterior of fleshy fibres. To prove how such an opinion is ill grounded, it is sufficient to remark, 1st, that the dura-mater, the tunica sclerotica, the periosteum, and the ligaments, are evidently of the same nature as the tendons and the aponeuroses, and that they completely differ from the muscular tissue. 2dly, that the chemical composition, the vital proper- ties, the apparent texture, are completely distinct in the tendinous fibre, from what they are in the muscular. 3dly, that there is no kind of con- nection between the functions of the one and those of the other. There certainly is less analogy be- tween the muscle and the tendon that receives its insertion, than between this last, and the bone that supplies it with one, and with which organ the cartilaginous part bear a similitude in its na-186 FIBROUS SYSTEM. ture. A muscle and its tendon form an organic apparatus, and not a simple organ. What is the nature of the fibrous tissue ? It is unknown, because it is not found possessed of such properties as would characterize it; it has none but negatives, of those of the muscular tissue cha- racterized by contractility, and of those of the nervous tissue marked by sensibility. It is always found in a passive state ; it obeys the action im- parted to it, but of itself is incapable of any. It constitutes between the organs in which it is found, and the skin, the cellular tissue, the car- tilages, the serous membranes, &c., a very essen- tial distinction. It was incorrect to refer all these parts to the same class, under the deno- mination of white organs—an idle vague expres- sion, that refers only to external appearances, to a comparison of analysis still incomplete, and not at all applicable to the texture, the vital pro- perties, the vitality, and functions of the organs. Fourcroy had foreseen that this too general a division should be subordinate to ulterior ex- periments. Let this be as it may, the following lines will give the result obtained from the fibrous tissue, when submitted to maceration, ebullition, desicca- tion, and to the action of acids, &c. Submitted to maceration in a moderate degree of temperature, the fibrous tissue remains a long timeFIBliOUS SYSTEM. 187 without undergoing any alteration ; it preserves its volume, form, and density ; this last lessens by degrees; the tissue softens, but is never dilated or swelled, as has been said ; its fibres may then be divided from each other, and the cellular tissue that was interposed between, is evidently seen to de- cay. Finally, after a very considerable time, it is converted into a soft and whitish pulp, of an homogeneous appearance. All the fibrous organs do not diffuse in this manner with equal facility. The tendons yield first to maceration ; next the aponeuroses; amongst the latter, those formed by the expansion of a tendon are sooner softened than those intended to inclose the limbs, than the fascia-lata for instance : the fibrous mem- branes, the capsules, and sheaths of the same nature, are more resistant. Finally, these liga- ments resist longer the action of water that tends to soften them ; however, when they originally proceed from a tendon, as the interior ligaments of the patella, they yield much sooner to macera- tion. I have made experiments upon all these organs in a comparative point of view, and the result was what I have just stated. Every fibrous organ immersed in boiling wa- ter, or exposed to a great degree of heat, shrinks, and contracts, as the greatest part of animal tis- sues ; it is reduced to a smaller volume ; on which account it becomes more solid, and assumes a de- gree of elasticity it does not possess in the naturalFIBROUS SYSTEM* 188 state, and which it subsequently loses by soften- ing to be converted into a gelatinous state. By putting all the parts of this system at the same time in water, that is gradually heated to ebulli- tion, this softening is observed to be produced in the same degree in each, and nearly to the same extent. That force, which in this instance tends to contract the fibres of this system, is very consi- derable, it suffices to tear off those of the periosteum from their insertions, and which, by this mechanism are removed from the bones that have been boil- ing for some length of time ; also to separate the inter-osseous ligaments, the obturator membrane, &c., when they are plunged in boiling water along with the bones to which they adhere ; it is also sufficient to lock the articulating surfaces so effectually against each other, that they can no longer be removed, when, together with their ligaments, they have been exposed to considerable heat. The fibrous tissue softens by degrees in boiling water, becomes rather yellow, semi-transparent, and finally is, in part, diffused. In boiling to- gether all the parts of the fibrous tissue, I have observed that the tendons are first softened ; next the aponeuroses, then the membranes, capsules, and fibrous sheaths, and finally the ligaments, that are as in respect to maceration, those that yield the last. Many others have already made this remark, to which I add, that all the ligaments189 FIBROUS SYSTEM. do not resist alike ; those interposed between the lamellae of the vertebrae resist the longest ; they do not display that yellowish aspect, that semi- transparent appearance common to all the fibrous system that has been boiled ; they remain white, tough, seem to contain much less gelatine, and to be completely distinct in their nature. On being exposed to the action of air, the fibrous system loses its white appearance, by the evaporation of the fluids it contains; it contracts, becomes yellow, partly transparent, and is easily ruptured. If a few days after having been dried, it is again immersed, it will re-assume its white- ness, its softness, and nearly its primitive appear- ance ; so that it might be supposed the whitish appearance is attributable to the water only : this phenomenon applies particularly to the tendons. I have also observed another very remarkable phenomenon, in respect to the latter, which is, that after having been macerated for some time, and then dried, they do not in the process acquire a yellowish hue, but remain particularly white. This undoubtedly must also be the case in respect to the whole svstem. •/ The action of the nitric and sulphuric acids rapidly softens the fibrous tissue, and reduces it to a kind of pulp, blackish in the one, yellow in the other ; the moment this tissue is plunged into the acid, it twists and contracts, in the same manner as in boiling water.190 FIBROUS SYSTEM. In general, the fibrous tissue affords less resist- ance to putrefaction than the cartilaginous, but much more than the medullary, the cutaneous, the mucous systems, &c. Amidst the putrefied and disorganized tissues in our dissecting-rooms, it is still found uninjured; finally, it undergoes the same change. The water in which it has been macerated, gives a less offensive smell than that used for the greatest part of the other systems. Easier of digestion than cartilages and fibro- cartilages, the fibrous tissue is less so than several others, as Spallanzani and Gosse have prov- ed by their experiments. It appears to be acted upon by the gastric juices, in the same order as in maceration and ebullition. These orders are, Istly. The tendons; Qdly. The apo- neuroses ; 3dly. The different fibrous membranes; 4thly. The ligaments, that are the hardest of diges- tion. I must remark, however, that when once the fibrous tissue has been softened by concoction, these different organs are digested with nearly the same facility. Thus are cartilages, when they have become gelatinous, as easily digested as tendons, and even more so, as Spallanzani has proved by trying the experiment upon himself; although they are much more indigestible, being raw.FIBROUS SYSTEM. 191 SECTION II. Common Parts entering into the Organization of the Fibrous System. The cellular tissue is met with in every fibrous organ, but in more or less abundance, accordingly as their fibres are more distant or more con- tracted. In some ligaments, it forms for the fibrous bundles, sheaths similar to those* for muscles; in others, in tendons, aponeuroses, &c. it is scarcely perceived, but is rendered every where very evident, by maceration, by morbid affections ; for instance, in the funguses of the dura-mater, in the carcinomia of the testis, that has invaded the tunica albuginea, in certain affections of the periosteum, &c. In all these cases the fibrous tissue, relaxed, softened, vitiated, and converted into a spongy substance, suffers its fibres to disunite, and the cellular tissue to appear bare. The formation of granulations, the soft nature of these productions in certain wounds, in which the fibrous organ has been concerned, also prove the presence of the cellular organ, which besides is here in general met with in a trifling degree,—a circumstance that contributes a great deal in producing the resistance and power in the organs that belong to them. Does this cellular tissue contain any fat ? None is ob- served at first sight, since the tissue in itself isFIBROUS SYSTEM. 192 hardly discernible ; however, I have repeatedly remarked, that by submitting to desiccation parts of the aponeurosis, of the periosteum, of the dura- mater, &c. perfectly cleared of any other part, when all these fluids had evaporated, and that the organ had borrowed that appearance of parch- ment which is then remarked, an exudation of fat was seen in different parts over its surface. The number of vessels varies in the fibrous sys- tefevery considerable, in several organs, as in the dura-mater, the periosteum, &c.; they are less so in others, as in the aponeuroses, and not at all in some, as in tendons. I have observed that in ge- neral, inflammations and different tumours are most frequent in those which contain the most vessels. The affections of the dura-mater, of the periosteum, when compared with those of ten- dons, are remarkable proofs of it. I have never heard absorbant vessels had ever been traced in / the fibrous system. Notwithstanding all that has been written re- specting the nerves of the periosteum, of the dura- mater, &c. this system does not appear to be pro- vided with these organs.FIBKOUS SYSTEM. 193 ARTICLE III. Properties of the Fibrous System. section r. Physical Properties. In the natural state, the fibrous system hardly admits of any elasticity ; but when removed from the body, and its different organs are submitted to desiccation, they acquire this faculty in a very evident degree. Thus, the tendons, the aponeu- rotic shreds, &c. which in a fresh state could admit of no vibration at all, are made capable of resounding in musical instruments, when very much dried. SECTION II. Properties of the Tissue. The properties of the tissue are evident in the fibrous system, but less so than in many others. Extensibility of the dura-mater is demonstrated in hydrocephalus; of the periosteum, in the dif- ferent obstructions that affect the bones ; of the aponeurosis, in the various tumefactions of the limbs; in the distensions of the abdominal pari- etes, which, as is well known, are as much apo- neurotic as fleshy; of the fibrous capsules, in dropsy of the articulations : of the tunica scleroti- vol. ii. o194 FIBIIOUS SYSTEM. ca, and albuginea, in the tumefactions of their re- spective organs. This extensibility in the fibrous system is sub- jected to a permanent law, that does not relate to the extensibility of the other systems; it can be effected only in a slow, gradual, and insensible manner, so that whenever it is too abruptly brought into action, two different phenomena will ensue, both of them admitting of an equal impossibility of sudden extension, observable in a muscle, the skin, the cellular tissue, &c.; 1st, If the resistance of the fibrous organ be superior to the effort it experiences, it will not gi ve way, and different accidents are the result. Instances of them are met with in the inflammatory obstruc- tions that form under the aponeuroses of the limbs, under those of the skull, within the fibrous sheaths of the tendons, &e. ; then these different fibrous organs, not calculated to extend with the same rapidity as the subjacent parts that swell, painfully compress those tumefied parts, and sometimes even make them liable to gangrene : this is actually the case in those con- tractions, so frequently met with in surgical practice, and which render various operations necC5sary; 2dly, If the fibrous organ be inferior in resistance iC the sudden effort it is exposed to, it is parted instead of yielding; hence the rupture of tendons, the lacerations of the fibrous capsules, and ligaments in luxations, those oi the apo-FIBROUS SYSTEM. 195 neuroses m certain rure cases, 1 elated by divei& authors, See. Sec. It will be easily conceived that the great resistance with which the fibrous system is endowed, is essentially owing to this impossibi. lity of yielding abruptly to the given impulse. In the slow and gradual extension that fibrous organs admit of, it is observed, that irecjuentlv far from being reduced in thickness, of extending their surface at the expence of this dimension, their thickness, on the contrary, is increased. The tunica albuginea scirrhus testis, the tunica sclerotica of a dropsical or cancerous eye, the periosteum of a rickety bone, &c. : display these phenomena, the reverse of which is sometimes observed, as in the distensions of the abdominal aponeurosis, produced by pregnancy, by acute dropsy in hydrocephalus, &c. The contractility of the tissue is accommodated in the fibrous system to its mode of extensibility : as it cannot be suddenly distended, so it cannot abruptly contract when distension ceases. This fact is striking in the section of a tendon, of the aponeurotic portion of a ligament laid bare in a living animal, in the incision of the dura-mater, to give an outlet to blood under this mem- brane, &c. In all these cases the divided surfaces admit but of a very trifling separation : thus in the rupture of a tendon, division being produced, not by the contraction of the divided surfaces, but o 2196 FIBROUS SYSTEM. only by the motions of the limb, contact is ob- tained by placing the patient in such a position, as that in which the tendon will not be drawn in the natural state ; whilst, for a divided muscle, not only this position is required, but also that which produces the most relaxation ; and even then, very often, the divided parts cannot be brought in contact. If, while a muscle is distended, the tendon of this muscle be divided in a living animal, the end continued with the fleshy fibres will withdraw a little from the other, by the retraction of these fibres ; but the one that holds to the bone remains unmoved; so that in this case, one cause only of retraction exists, whereas in the division of a fleshy part, there are two. Jf a tendon be divided when the muscle is relaxed, the ends remain close to each other. The contractility of tissue, however, after some time has elapsed, discloses itself in the fibrous sys- tem, particularly when the organ has been ori- ginally distended; for in its natural state, it is nearly wanting. The tunica sclerotica, subsequent to the puncture of the eye, or to the amputation of the anterior half of that organ, and the evacua- tion of itshumours; the tunica albuginea; the proper tunic of the spleen, and that of thekidnies, after the re-solution of tumours, that have distended their respective organs; the fibrous capsules subsequent197 FIBROUS SYSTEM. to the evacuation of the fluid of dropsical articula- tions ; the abdominal aponeurosis, after the first, even the second delivery ; the periosteum subse- quent to the re-solution of exostoses, &c.; all gra- dually contract, and re-assume their primitive forms. SECTION HI. Vital Properties. Animal contractility, and sensible organic con- tractility, are completely wanting in the fibrous system ; like every other organ, it is possessed of organic sensibility, and insensible organic con- tractility. In the natural state, it is also endowed with animal sensibility ; but this property is displayed in a peculiar mode, no other system in the econo- my, I believe, affords an instance of, and which has not yet been properly explained. The common agents that bring it into action, such as the divers mechanical and chemical agents, &c., would be ineffectual here, unless the organ be in a state of inflammation. The tendons, the aponeuroses, the fibrous membranes, the ligaments, &c., laid bare in operations, in experiments on living ani- mals, and variously excited, give no kind of pain. All that has been written respecting the sensibility of the periosteum, of the dura-mater, &c., taken in this sense, is evidently contradictedFIBROUS SYSTEM. 198 by observation ; but if the fibrous organs be ex- posed to a sudden and violent extension, their animal sensibility will be developed to the utmost. This fact is particularly remarkable in the liga- ments, the fibrous capsules, the aponeuroses, &c. Lay bare an articulation in a dog, that of the leg, for instance : dissect away carefully the sur- rounding organs, particularly the nerves, so as to leave the ligaments only, and let these be irritated by a mechanical or chemical agent: the animal will not move, or give signs of pain : then distend these ligaments by twist- ing the articulation ; the animal will instantly struggle, be convulsed, and express its agonies by cries, &c.; finally, let these ligaments be di- vided, so as to leave the synovial membrane only, which here is situate in the fibrous capsule, and let these two bones be twisted in reverse directions ; there is no longer any pain. Aponeuroses, and even tendons laid bare, and drawn in contrary directions, display the same phenomenon. I have repeatedly tried these experiments, which prove what I have stated indisputably; namely, that ordinary means are not sufficient to bring the ani- mal sensibility of the fibrous system into play, and that this faculty is strongly characterized in the distensions to which this system is liable. Let it be remarked, that this mode of being excited, is analogous to the functions it fulfils. In fact, pro- tected by its deep position from chemical or me-Flint OUS SYSTEM. 199 chanical injury, it does not require, like the cu- taneous system, for instance, a sensibility that would transmit the impression ; on the contrary, the greater part of the organs, such as the liga- ments, the fibrous capsules, the tendons, &c. being much exposed to distension, and liable to be drawn by the violent motions of the limbs, it was indispensible That we should be warned of the approach of danger, the excess of which might prove so fatal to the articulations and to the limbs. Thus it is nature accommodates the animal sensibility of every organs to the different exciting causes the organ may experience, par* ticularly to those that might become fatal if we were not warned against them; this vital power is the essential agent that keeps the animal on the watch for its preservation. To this mode of sensibility in the fibrous sys- tem, must particularly be attributed ; 1st. The vio- lent pains that attend luxation ; 2dly. Those still more violent inflicted on the patient, by the exten- sions exerted with a view of producing them, particularly when, as with ancient dislocations, extraordinary exertion is required ; 3dly. The in- expressible sufferings caused by the punishment that consisted in quartering an unfortunate wretch with horses; 4thly. The painful sensation arising from sprains, from a forced distention of the spine, and consequently of its ligaments, by too ab- rupt a motion to turn the head, &c. ; ffthly. TheFIBROUS SYSTEM. 200 acute pains experienced immediately before the accident by those that have ruptured a tendon, pains that are partly destroyed by the accident itself; 6thly. Those less violent, which we ex- perience when any tendon, the tendon achilles for instance, is, by a wrong* position, rather too much extended; 7thly. The considerable increase of pain experienced when, in a collection of mat- ter beneath an aponeurosis, this not admitting of extension, is forcibly elevated ; 8thly. The painful sensation experienced, when the leg is too much extended, and the two oblique liga- ments intended to limit this extension are too strongly drawn in the attempt, &c. &c. To the deficiency of sensibility in the fibrous organs in respect to one mode of excitation, and to their sensibility in respect to another, must be referred, the contradictory results produced by the experiments of Haller, and those of his antagonists on the other, with regard to the dura- mater. Characters of the Vital Properties. Vital activity begins to be more evident in the fibrous system than in those of the bones and car- tilages. This is very evidently proved ; 1st. By the mode of animal sensibility, we have just noticed, and which is wanting in the others ;201 FIBROUS SYSTEM. 2dly. By a much greater predisposition in this system, to become more or less frequently the seat of pains, and especially of inflammations, &c.; 3dly. By the excessively acute type this af- fection assumes in this system, as may be seen in acute rheumatism, which essentially affects the fibrous parts of the great articulations of the arm- pit, of the hip, of the knee, of the elbow, &c. ; the aponeurotic parts of the muscle, &c.; 4thly. By the excessive mobility of rheumatic pains which fly with astonishing rapidity from one part to another, and consequently imply that the vi- tal powers of the different parts of this system may undergo alterations with the greatest rapi- dity ; 5thly0 By its cicatrizing more rapidly. Thus in laying bare a fracture made expressly in animals, I have constantly noticed, that granu- lations proceeding from the periosteum and the medullary organ, were formed before those of the bone had hardly begun to appear. In regard to this cicatrization, I have observed that the parts of the fibrous system which admit the greatest number of blood-vessels, such as the periosteum, the fibrous membranes, the capsules, &c. more rea- dily admit of this phenomenon, than those where little or hardly any blood is admitted, as in ten- dons, the ends of which unite with difficulty only; 6thly, and finally, The difference between the vitality of the fibrous system and that of the^02 FIBROUS SYSTEM. \ preceding systems, may also be easily ascertained by comparing the progress of an exostosis with that much more rapid of a periostosis, of a col- lection in the dura-mater, &c. In respect to vi- tality, however, a remarkable degree of slowness is still observed in this system ; it is particularly noticed in certain affections of the limbs in which gangrene takes place, and is, as well as the pre- vious inflammation, excessively rapid in its in- vasion, in. the cellular tissue, the muscles, &c. whilst, as I have said, the tendons that are laid bare require some time before they partake of the injury, and amidst the dark and livid aspect of the parts, are remarkable for their whiteness. The fibrous system presents a remarkable phe- nomenon in never admitting the secretion of pus. I have never heard, that subsequent to the in- flammations of this system any purulent collec- tion has been observed. Rheumatism that has been ranked with the phlegmasiae is never at- tended with such collections, a few gelatinous extravasations only have been observed round the tendons. What had been mistaken in former times for a suppuration of the dura mater in wound's of the head, was evidently a purulent transudation from the tunica arachnoides, simi- lar to that of the other membranes. What can be the reason that pus is seldom or ever formed in this system, or at least, why have these organs less ten-203 FIBROUS SYSTEM. dency to admit of it than almost every other ? I cannot tell: neither have I ever heard that purulent collections had been met with in car- tilages. The inflammations of the cartilaginous system are very remarkable, because they seldom, or hardly ever terminate in suppuration. Sympathies. Sympathies of every description are met with in the fibrous system. Amongst the animal sym- pathies let us state a few of sensibility; 1st. In peculiar cases of periostosis occupying but a very small surface, the whole of the periosteum remains sound, becomes painful, &c. ; 2dly. Subsequent to a puncture or a bruise of the periosteum the whole limb swells and is painful; 3dly. During the affection of the dura-mater, the eye is frequently affected and cannot bear the contact of light: this as I have before stated, may proceed from the com- munication of the cellular tissue, but it is cer- tainly in some cases sympathetic ; 4thly, Whilst extensions are exerted to reduce a luxation, the patient frequently complains of pain in a very distant part of the limb, &c. &c. Contractility is also brought into action in the animal sympathies of the fibrous system. 1st. A puncture in the centre of the diaphragm causes, it is said, a contraction in the muscles of the face, from which proceeds the sardonic laugh. The injuries ofFIBROUS SYSTEM. 204 aponeuroses; the distension of the ligaments in luxations of the foot, and the laceration of ten- dons, are frequently attended with convulsive mo- tions in the jaws,—even with confirmed teta- nes. A splinter in the dura mater will produce contractions in several muscles of the economy. In injuries of the tunica albuginea, and of the exterior aponeurosis similar phenomena are fre- quently observed. In the organic sympathies of the fibrous sys- tem, insensible organic contractility is sometimes called into action ; at other times it is the sensible organic contractility. The following are a few instances of the first case :—1st. The dura-mater being inflamed, inflammation, that naturally sup- poses an increase of the tonic powers, or of insen- sible organic contractility, frequently takes place in the pericranium, and vice versa. 2dly. The irritation of the periosteum, when rather con- siderable, frequently produces inflammation in the medullary organ, and causes that organ to sup- purate. Sdly. The articulating ligaments being distended by a sprain, all the adjacent parts, and frequently the whole limb, will swell and become a centre of irritation, in which the powers of vi- tality, particularly insensible contractility, are much greater than in the natural state, &c. At other times sensible organic contractility is called into action. 1st. In the operation of de- pressing the cataract, the injury to the scele-205 FIBROUS SYSTEM* rotic tunic has caused sympathetic vomiting, &c. 2dly. Intense pain arising from any part whatever, particularly from the fibrous sys- tem, considerably increases the sensible or- ganic contractility of the heart, and thus causes a sympathetic acceleration in the circulation of the blood. I have seen a man in whom Desault was reducing a luxation, suffer such violent pains from the great distension of the ligaments, that he could not retain his faeces, such was the con- traction of the rectum. It is evident that in these sympathies the fibrous system sometimes exercises its influence over the others; sometimes also these exercise their action upon the fibrous system. It is on be- ing extended, that the peculiar mode of animal sensibility it enjoys is so powerfully excited, as to cause in the economy a remarkable sympathetic disturbance. The ancients, I presume, mistook all the white parts, the ligaments, the tendons, &c. for nerves, on account of the serious accidents they had observed resulting from their distension, in sprains, in the complex luxations of the knee, of the elbow, of the instep,—luxations that cannot take place without a violent extension of a number of ligaments, of aponeurotic and tendinous parts, &c. A wound from the sabre, that divides the li- gaments of the tarsus, and bruises from the fall of heavy weights, are attended with far less serious consequences than a false position that distends206 FIBROUS SYSTEM. them. This leads us to a very important and inte- resting general consideration, the correctness of which is also ascertained by the study of the other systems ; namely, that it is the mode of vital pro- perty which predominates in a system, that is specially called into action in sympathies. As that mode of animal sensibility calculated to answer to the agents of distension, is the most predominant, t acts the principal part in sympathies of the fibrous system. ARTICLE IV. Development of the Fibrous System. SECTION I. State of that System in the early Age. In the mucous state of the embryo, the fibrous organs cannot as yet be distinguished. Every tiling is confused. It is only after several other organs are formed, that they begin to be traced. Those in the form of membranes first appear as a transparent canvas; those disposed in bundles appear an homo- geneous body. In general the fibres are not distinct at first; the aponeuroses, the fibrous membranes, the tendons, &c. have not presented to me the slightest outline of them ; every thing at that stage seemed to be uniform in the texture of the fibrous or-FIBROUS S VST EM. €07 o-ans. In a foetus of seven months, a few white threads begin to be perceived in an insensible manner,—very scarce at first, and separate from each other, they draw nearer subsequent to birth, and assume a parallel disposition, or interweave in various directions, according to the organ which they wholly invade, at a certain age, if I may be allowed the expression. These observations are more easily made in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm, in the aponeurosis of the thigh, or the dura-mater. In proportion as the fibres are developed in the fibrous organs, they present more resistance and hardness. In the foetus, and in early life, they are exceedingly soft, and yield easily. Their colour is quite different from that they display at a more advanced age : it is a pearly whiteness ; it is only by degrees they acquire that degree of strength which especially characterizes their tissue. To this softness, to this deficiency of resistance of the fibrous system in early life, the follow- ing phenomena must be attributed :—1st. The articulations at that age admit of motions, that, from the rigidity of the ligaments, are subse- quently impossible. Every extension may then be forced beyond its natural degree. It is suffi- ciently known, this is the time when what are called tumblers begin to exercise; they could never succeed in performing those extraordinary208 FIBROUS SYSTEM. motions, which strike us, if habit had not kept up from infancy the faculty of these motions. 2dly In general, luxations are very rare at this pe- riod, because the fibrous capsules yield without parting. 3dly. Sprains are then attended with less consequence. 4thly. The inflammatory collections beneath the aponeuroses very sel- dom produce those distensions that frequently prove fatal in the adult. This suppleness in the fibrous system is also accommodated in the ten- dons, the ligaments, and the aponeuroses, &c.; on the one hand, to the multiplicity and frequency of the motions of the child • on the other, to their want of energy. I have remarked, that although the fibrous system in early life displays a softness of tex- ture nearly uniform, in all the parts belonging to the same order, it is, however, more or less de- veloped, according to the different regions. In general, when it belongs to organs very forward in their formation, as the dura-mater, the tunica sclerotica, &c. it is proportionally thicker, and is more voluminous; but these differences relate only to its dimensions, and not at all to its intimate organization. It is likely this mode of organization in the fibrous system influences, at this period, its inode of vitality, and consequently its diseases. It is well known that rheumatism, which seems in all probability to affect this system, is so very rare in209 FIBROUS SYSTEM. infancy, that in a hundred subjects afflicted with this complaint, ninety-nine at least have exceeded the age of fifteen or sixteen. When submitted to ebullition in the foetus or the infant, the fibrous system is easily dissolved, but does not assume that yellowish hue, its con- stant attribute, when submitted to the same pro- cess in the adult. The jellies formed from young animals are, as it is well known, much whiter than those proceeding from old ones. SECTION II. Slate of the Fibrous System in the subsequent Ages, In proportion as we advance in age, this system becomes stronger and more dense; in the adult age, it remains stationary, as it were, notwith- standing that the alternate absorption and exhala- tion of the nutritive substances are still continued. In the natural state, these two functions are not distinguished from each other without difficulty; but the former becomes very apparent, when by any contusion, or an internal cause, the perios- teum, the fibrous capsules, the ligaments, &c. swell, are obstructed, &c.; the latter in turn pre- dominates when disgorging or re-solution ensue. In the aged subject, the fibrous system gradu- ally becomes denser and tighter. It resists ma- ceiation and putrefaction much longer. The teeth of animals that feed upon it, tear it with vol. II.FIBROUS SYSTEM. 210 more difficulty; the gastric juices do not so readily act upon it. Spallanzani has observed,that tendons, and aponeuroses of aged animals, were harder of digestion than those of young ones. The powers of the fibrous tissue increase with age, but its softness decreases; hence the difficulty that attends mo- tions,—the stiffness that characterizes them. The ligaments, and the fibrous capsules, suffer the ar- ticulating surfaces to separate from each other without difficulty; tendons will hardly admit of being bent; whenever the parts wherein they are laid bare under the ligaments, are pressed, they are found to be hard, void of suppleness, &c. and it is only with difficulty, and after a long time, that they can be softened by ebullition. The whole fibrous system becomes yellow. One might suppose it then approaches that dense, con- tracted, and semi-transparent state, to which it Will be reduced by desiccation ; so that if it could be admitted that this system underwent the dif- ferent periods of its decay with more rapidity than the others do, every motion would cease, from the rigidity of the ligaments, tendons, and aponeuroses, although the power of contraction would be still preserved by the muscles.211 FIBROUS SYSTEM. SECTION III. Accidental Dev elopement of the Fibrous System. We have seen that different productions, belong- ing by their nature to the bony and cartilaginous systems, are sometimes accidentally developed in peculiar parts. Pathological anatomy also discloses to us productions in which the fibrous appearance is very evident. In tumours of the womb, of the fal- lopian tubes, &c. I have had repeated opportuni- ties of ascertaining the fact; instead of the greasy matter so commonly met with in organic affec- tions, one or two fibrous collections heaped toge- ther, very distinct, and of a yellowish appear- ance, are found. I cannot affirm that these ex- crescences essentially belong, in respect to their component parts, to the fibrous system, having never comparatively submitted them to experi- ments with the organs of that system. ARTICLE V. Fibrous Membrane in general. After having considered the fibrous system in a general manner, in respect to its organization, its vitality, its properties, and nutrition, I shall par- ticularly examine it in the essential divisions it offers, and which we have pointed out before. I shall begin with the hbrous membranes. p 2212 FIBKOUS SYSTEM. SECTION I. Forms of the Fibrous System. - * f • '■ • • * * * These kinds of membranes that compose, as I have said before, the periosteum, the dura-mater, the tunica sclerotica, the tunica albuginea, the membranes proper to the kidneys, to the spleen, to the corpora cavernosa, &c. are nearly all intended to form external coatings, tubes in which the or- gans they inclose are contained. These organs are not like those round which the serous surfaces are placed, as the stomach, the intestines, the bladder, the lungs, liable to al- ternate dilatations and contractions. This would not accord with their mode of extensibility; they are closely moulded upon the forms of these or- gans ; they show none of those numerous folds formed in the serous membranes, excepting, how- ever, in the dura-mater, they adhere by both sur- faces, a character that renders them essentially distinct from the preceding, as well as from the mucous membranes. One of these surfaces, intricately united with the organ, seems to project to it divers ex- tensors, which identify in a first glance its ex- istence with that of the membrane. Innumerable threads, projecting from the tunica albuginea, from the membrane of the cavernous bodies, from213 FIBK006 SYSTEM. the proper tunic of the spleen, &c. or rather ad- hering to these tunics, plunge into the respective organs of these membranes, and therein inter- weave in a variety of directions, forming, as it were, the frame around which the other con- stituent parts of these organs are arranged and sustained, that seem from this to be moulded upon their exterior membranes: thus are they seen, on these moulds being removed, forming here and there irregular projections- In displacements too considerable to admit of the periosteum extending over the divided surfaces, the callus is uneven and rough, Stc. The figure of the testis changes whenever the tunica albuginea has been implicated, &c. This adherence of the fibrous membrane which incloses different organs, with the interior prolongations of these organs, with the fibres that form their can- vas, has induced several anatomists to believe that their nature is similar; that these were nothing more than elongations of the membrane. I was of this opinion myself when I published my treatise upon the membranes, but ulterior experi- ments have undeceived me. First, I can affirm, that the membranes of the corpora cavernosa exclusively belong, in these bodies, to the fibrous system. The interior spongy tissue contained within the cavity of the mem- brane has not the same nature, and is not, asFIBROUS SYSTEM. 214 anatomists have asserted, an extension of it. They are not lamellae, which, according to the vulgar expression, have, by separating from the mem- brane, produced by their intersection the spongy tissue. This is another substance, distinct in its vitality and properties. By submitting the corpus cavernosum to ebul- lition, I have evidently made this distinction : the external membrane acts like all other fibrous or- gans ; it thickens, becomes yellowish, semi-trans- parent, then diffuses more or less into gelatine ; the spongy tissue on the contrary remains white, soft, does not increase in bulk, nor contract when submitted to the action of fire ; in a word, it presents an aspect that cannot be compared with that of any other tissue subjected to the same experiment. Maceration also serves to distinguish these tis- sues from each other. The first yields but slowly, its fibres remain for a long time distinct; they still retain their natural disposition when the second is already reduced to an homogeneous pulp of a reddish appearance, in which nothing fibrous, nothing organic, can be distinguished. It appears in general, that the spongy tissue of the corpora cavernosa is their essential part; that in which the important phenomena of erection are produced, that which is animated by the peculiar motion that distinguishes it from all other organs.FIBKOUS SYSTEM. 215 The fibrous peel is accessary only to its functions ; it is nothing more than an envelope. In erection, it merely obeys the impulse received. Whenever the corpus cavernosum is exposed to the action of nitric acid, the spongy tissue cleared of the blood it contained, assumes a much deeper yellow than the fibrous membrane. This serves to distinguish them from each other. By submitting the testis to the action of boiling water, its interior tissue is also seen to assume quite a different aspect from that of its exterior membrane; this is of a dark brown hue, whilst the other remains whitish; nor does it so readily admit of a gelatinous appearance, nor in so strik- ing a manner as that of the corpus cavernosum. When submitted to maceration, the testis is also quite different in its envelope, and in its interior tissue. The surface of the fibrous membranes, opposed to that corresponding with their organ, is united to the adjacent parts, sometimes in a loose man- ner, as in the cavernous envelope, at other times by very strong ties, as in the dura-mater. In general, the membranes, and even all the fibrous organs, have an astonishing tendency to unite intimately with the serous and mucous sur- faces. Instances are produced in respect to the serous membranes, by the union of the dura-ma- ter with the tunica arachnoides, of the tunica al- buginea with the tunica vaginalis, of the fibrous216 , fibkous system* with the synovial capsules; such is the intimacy of these adhesions, that they cannot be destroyed in the adult by the nicest dissection. During in- fancy it is much less, as is particularly seen in the connection existing between the basis of the peri- cardium and the the diaphragm, and which con- nection is such, that in these early years, the two surfaces which are contiguous more than conti- nued, may easily be separated, whilst in the sub- sequent ages it could not possibly be effected. As to the union of the mucous with the fibrous surfaces, whenever they are contiguous they are completely confounded with each other. This is observed in the pituitary membrane, imthe mem- brane of the sinuses, in that of the ear, &c. The pericondrium of the larynx, of the trachea, form but one with their internal membrane: in all these parts the periosteum is so interwoven with the mucous surface that it is impossible to sepa- rate them, they are removed together from the bone which is then left bare. The vas deferens, the fallopian tubes, the ureters, &c. are also most evidently fibro-mucous organs. SECTION II. Organization of the Fibrous Membrane i'} nun linn The fibrous membranes in general have a very tight texture, a remarkable thickness, and are formed of a single sheet. The dura-mater seems to be an exception to this rule in the foldsFIBROUS SYSTEM. 217 formed by the falx and the tentorium cerebelli; but except in the sinus, it is difficult, nay even impossible, to find in it two distinct lamellee. These membranes possess more vessels than all the other divisions of the fibrous system ; they have numerous perforations for the passage of these vessels, the greatest number of which only cross them and proceed to the organs they cover. These perforations are of larger dimensions than the vessels they give passage to, form another character of the fibrous membranes, distinct from the serous that constantly fold, and never open to admit the vascular system into their respective organs. The particular description of the membranes we are examining, will be added to that of the organs they inclose. I must, however, except the periosteum, the description of which belongs to these generalities, either because clothing the whole system of the bones it cannot be consi- dered in an isolated manner, or because, as I have stated, it forms the centre from which radiate, and to which resort all the organs of the fibrous system, so that its functions are more nearly allied to this system than to that of the bones. • t " * » - •' < I i • / 1 • . - - • i * SECTION III. Periosteum :—its Form. This membrane surrounds all the bones. Hard, resistant, grayish, it provides them with a coatingFIBROUS SYSTEM. 218 every where extended, except in such parts as are lined with cartilages; its thickness is remark- able in the infant; proportionably thinner in the adult, it gradually acquires more density and tightness. The ancients had figured to themselves this or- gan as extending from one bone to the other, over the articulation, and thus forming a continued bag for the whole skeleton. This idea is incor- rect. In the junctions of bones, the periosteum interweaves with the ligaments that afford it means of communicating, and in this manner only continuity can be conceived: the crown of the tooth, as well as all the bony productions arising from the heads of certain animals, are un- provided with it. The periosteum, in infancy, is slightly united to the bone : and is removed from it with the utmost facility, particularly from the part of the long bones. In the adult, as the calcareous substance has gradually invaded its most internal fibres, the adherence is very obvious ; it is excessively so in the aged subject, in which this membrane, by the progress of ossification, is frequently reduced to a very thin layer. The continual pressure poduced by the contraction of the muscles, may very probably influence this adherence. Divers pro- , jections proceed from the periosteum to the bone ; they are much more numerous in the extremities of long bones and on the short ones, than in theFIBROUS SYSTEM. 219 middle of the long and on the flat bones, which is easily conceived, from the greater number of apertures in the former than in the latter part. These prolongations attend the vessels lin- ing the ducts, by which the bones, in different parts, are perforated, and are lost in those which terminate in the substance: they do not penetrate the medullary canal, but solely restricted to the tissue of the bone, form between this and the mem- brane from whence they originate an intimate con- nexion. Such are the connexions, the destruction of which, when the periosteum is diseased, or se- parated to rather a considerable extent, causes the death and separation of the bone beneath. There is this distinction, however, between this phenomenon and the death of the bone, caused by the injury the medullary organ may have un- dergone ; that if this happens to be disorganized, the whole bone dies ; whereas, if the periosteum be irritated, or torn from the central part of a long bone, in an extent nearly equal to that of the medullary membrane, it is the external lay- ers only of the compact tissue that exfoliate, and the same bone remains. I have lately tried this experiment upon dogs. In what regards the re- moval of the periosteum, not only from the central part, but from the whole surface of the bone, I am not aware that it has ever been attempted.220 FIBROUS SYSTEM. but it has: appeared to me impracticable ; if it were not so, the animal would soon die from the extent of injury ; thus, no result could be obtained. The connexions between the periosteum and the adjacent organs, vary in an astonishing de- gree. In the greater number of bones the mus- cles glide upon it, and it is more or less ultimately united to them by cellular membrane, according to the necessity for motion. Subsequent to in- flammations, it loses this laxity, and frequently all motion is at an end. - - - L ' i" • . •; •, o . j i\ r; f f Organization of the Periosteum. | f . # ; *'i.

These fibres placed over each other, differ in length : the superficial are the most ex- tensive ; those that immediately correspond to the bone, overrun a short distance only. In ge- neral, they are all rendered very apparent by cer- tain diseases of these organs. Amongst numer- ous instances of this accidental develojjement of fibres, I recollect the ca$e of a man affected with elephantiasis, and at the same time labouring un- der a swelling in the compact tissue of the tibia.221 FIBROUS SYSTEM. that had acquired a very remarkable thickness. The periosteum of that bone was very thick, and so little adherent to that organ, that the slightest attempt sufficed to remove it in . its whole extent, and the fibres were so very thick, that upon being removed, it might have been mistaken for a portion of the palmar or plantar aponeurosis. The periosteum borrows its vessels from the ad- jacent ones. Their innumerable branches ramify in it ad infinitum, and form an intricate net, which is rendered very striking by injections, especially in infants: they are then lost in the compact tis- sue, or are returned to the adjacent parts, where they form divers anastomoses. This membrane, as we have said, gives inser tion to nearly the whole fibrous system; to the tendons, the ligaments, and especially to the apo- neuroses. It does not appear to be attached in ' the bones of infants, for by removing, at that age, the periosteum, the whole comes off together ; but ossification soon invades the most internal lamellae, and in the adult every fibrous organ seems indentified with the bone. I have observed that this disposition perfectly coincides with the pro- digious power of contraction which the muscles that have become more fully developed will form at that stage of life, and which power singly bearing upon the periosteum, which would have been the case had not ossification taken place,222 FIBROUS SI STEM. would not have met with a sufficient degree of resistance, whilst thus attached to the bone it moves that organ without endangering its cover- ing. The general organization, the properties, the vitality of the periosteum, being the same as those of the fibrous system, I shall pass over them unnoticed. Development of the Periosteum. In the foetus, this membrane is soft, spongy, permeated with a considerable quantity of gelati- nous fluid, and is easily diffused in water; its fibres are not very distinct, but they become more so as age advances; at the same time softness dimi- nishes, and resistance is increased. The periosteum in the aged subject is very tough; it will resist ebul- lition nearly as long as ligaments. Those who prepare skeletons are aware of this. It splits into several places, because its fibres, by contracting, separate from the bone; but the remaining part is with difficulty reduced to a cartilaginous state. Functions of the Periosteum. The periosteum protects the bone it covers from the impression of the surrounding moveable parts, from that of the muscles, from the arteries, the pulsation of which might wear them, as is the case with some aneurismal tumours near the sternum, the vertebras, &c.223 FIBROUS SYSTEM. There is a kind of parenchyma of nutrition in reserve, if I may be allowed the expression, con- stantly ready to receive the calcareous phosphate, when that substance cannot be conveyed to the diseased bone : hence the natural and artificial ne- croses which cannot take place in the teeth, because they are not provided with this membrane. These minute organs are subject to caries, and divers alterations, but never to a real necrosis. It can- not be doubted, but that the internal blades of the periosteum will successively admit of ossification, and thus contribute in some degree to increase the thickness of the bone, when its growth in the longitudinal sense is completed. I have observed in this respect, that not only this, but also the the aalincKna-bstan-ee ; after the cartilaginous sys- tem, it has the most tendency to become in- crusted, undoubtedly because its mode of general vitality, and particularly of organic sensibility, has a great analogy with that of the bones. Where- ever the tendons, by sliding over the bones, un- dergo considerable friction, they become ossified. The dura-mater, the tunica albuginea are fre- quently ossified ; the tunica sclerotica, in birds, performs the office of a parenchyma, conveying a considerable quantity of ^garthy substance, and to this must be referred the remarkable hardness of-their bonca.» The periosteum has nothing to do with the peculiar affinity with224 FIBROUS SYSTEM. formation of bone ; it contributes only to that of callus; it forms a kind of limit that confines the progress of ossification within its natural bounds, and prevents it from straying by irregular aberra- tions. Does it p^egare ^he ^lood intended for the nutrition of the ©£ga»s ? Experiments are insuffi- cient to resolve this question; but it may be as- serted that the vital properties it is possessed of, are by no means calculated to accelerate the cir- culation of the blood conveyed to the bone, as some authors had thought. Besides, it appears to me that the periosteum, in respect to the bones, has been examined in too exclusive a manner; it is no doubt indispensable to bones, but it may also act a more important part still, in respect to the fibrous organs. If na- ture has so completely provided* the* system of bones with this organ, it probably was because, as I have said, it found in that system a general, so- lid, and resistant support, that enables it to resist the various powers exercised upon it by the whole fibrous system,—a force that is itself imparted to this last system. Such is the new point of view in which the periosteum ought to be considered, and which leads more readily to general considera- tions than that in which Duhamel, Fourgeroux, &c. have considered this membrane.22 5 FIB R OU S S Y STEM. f .-SECTION IV. X- ( Perichondrium. i j Every non-articulating cartilage is covered with a membrane perfectly similar to the perios- teum, and denominated perichondrium; the larynx, the ribs, &c« are striking instances of it: it is thin, its fibres are intersected in every direction, and are less intimately attached to the organ it covers than the periosteum is with the bone, because the sur- face of cartilages not containing such a considera- ble number of apertures, does not project such a profusion of fibrous threads; hence there is a less intimate connection between the vitality of the perichondrium and that of the cartilage, than be- tween that of the bone and its periosteum. I have twice, in a young dog, stripped the thy- roid cartilage of its external membrane, and closed the wound immediately; it healed perfectly, without any apparent alteration in the cartilage ; at least the functions of this organ continued un- interrupted. A similar experiment might be easily tried upon the ribs, but I have not at- tempted it. In various injections, the perichon- drium did not appear to me to contain so great a number of blood-vessels as the periosteum : its uses are analogous to those of this last membrane. VOL. II. oN 226 FIBROUS SYSTEM. ARTICLE VI. Fibrous Capsules. i The fibrous capsules are infinitely more rare in the economy than has hitherto been thought. The scapulo humeral and the ilio-femoral articu- lations are almost exclusively provided with them ; in other parts, scarcely any thing more than the synovial membranes is to be met with. \ SECTION I. Forms of the Fibrous Capsules. These capsules form a kind of cylindrical tube, open at its two extremities, fastened by the cir- cumference of its apertures round the articulating surfaces, both superior and inferior, and inter- woven in these insertions with the periosteum ; they are so much the looser, as the articulation is calculated for more extensive motions; that of the humerus, for instance, admits of a much more extensive separation of the parts than that of the femur ; their lengths, in fact, are nearly the same. Now, as "on the one hand, the neck of the first bone is not so long as that of the second, and on the other hand, they are both inserted under this neck, it results from this, that the extension in both articulations is in a reverse ratio with the length of the articulating necks. These capsules, astonishingly strengthened by11B U O US SYSTEM. 227 tehdinous fibres,—even by tendons proceeding from the adjoining muscles, are outwardly sur- rounded with abundance of cellular tissue: they are sometimes perforated to give pas- sage to these tendons, which are fixed to the bone between them and the synovial mem- branes, as the scapulo-humeral articulation in respect to the sub-scapularis, is an instance. Ana- tomists having observed that tendons were in- serted in the capsules, have concluded from this, that the muscles of these tendons were intended to prevent the capsules from being compressed be- tween the articulating surfaces, when in motion. This appears probable to me ; but the muscles are at least intended, during extensive motions, to prevent the laxity of the capsule, which would otherwise have been weakened by that laxity : thus is the capsule of the shoulder-joint provided with several of these muscles, whilst none are observed in that of the femur, which, as I have before stated, is much tighter. These cap- sules are within very closely united with the sy- novial membrane, particularly in the adult; for in infants the adhesion is less. Towards their ex- tremities, however, this connection is deficient, because the synovial membrane by reflecting over the cartilage leaves between it and the cap- sule that proceeds to enter to the bone a trian- gular space ; and as this disposition is continued around the articulation, a kind of circular canal Q 2228 FIBROUS SYSTEM* is formed, filled with cellular tissue, and strewed with vessels. I have sometimes distended this by injections through a small aperture made in- tentionally. The intimate union of the capsule with the synovial membrane prevents this last organ from folding, and therefore secures it from the contusions to which in extensive motions it might be exposed. SECTION II. Functions of the Fibrous Capsules. Why are the fibrous capsules exclusively met with around the first kind of articulations only ? The reason is very simple : as these articulations are calculated to perform in every direction mo- tions nearly equal, they also require an equal re- sistance, whilst the others intended only to be moved in two or three ways, ligaments were ne- cessary to limit these motions. This explains why, for instance, the fibrous system is distributed around the ilio-femoral articulations in the form of a membrane, and united in isolated parts round the femero-tibial articulation, where the synovial membrane is nearly every where left bare. From all that has just been stated, it will be easily conceived that the fibrous capsules are com- pletely limited to securing the articulating con- nections, and that this use is evidently uncon- nected with synovial exhalation.FIBROUS SYSTEM. <229 When, in cases of unreduced luxations, the head of the bone has forsaken the articulating cavity, a new membrane forms round this head in the cellular tissue, and thus provides it with a cap- sule ; but this membrane is not of the same texture as the first. I have observed, that in two diffe- rent subjects no fibres could be traced; that its tissue was completely similar to that of the dif- ferent cysts frequently met with in various parts of the economy, particularly to those that form round the substances unconnected with the sys- tem, the presence of which has not produced suppuration, and, consequently, that these unnatu- ral productions belong rather to the class of se- rous than to that of the fibrous membranes. ARTICLE VII. \ Fibrous Sheaths. The fibrous sheaths, as we have said, are di- vided into partial and general. section i c Partial Fibrous Sheaths., The partial sheaths intended for a single ten- don are of two species. Some have rather a con- siderable distance to over-run ; such are, those of the flexors of the foot and of the hand, which ^01 respond with the whole concave surface of theFIBROUS SYSTEM. 230 phalanges ; the others merely form rings, in which a tendon is reflected, the great oblique of the eye is an instance. In general they all describe a semi-circle, and form a kind of semi-canal, completed by the bone in the opposite part, in such a manner that the tendon slides into a canal which is partly bony and partly fibrous. This canal is lined with a sy- novial membrane, the adherence of which with the fibrous sheath is equal to that of the articu- lating synovial organ with its capsule. In their external surfaces, the fibrous sheaths correspond to the adjacent organs, with which they are united by a loose cellular tissue. All these sheaths are composed of a very dense and tight tissue; they are stronger in propor- tion to the efforts of the tendons that act upon them than the fibrous capsules are in respect to the various impulsions of the bones, and which tend to lacerate these capsules. At their two edges they are confounded with the periosteum. Those of the flexors also unite their ends with the expansions of the tendons: thus is that very remarkable fibrous intersection, ob- served at the extremities of the last phalanges, accounted for. These kinds of sheaths in the limbs are met with in respect to the flexors only ; the extensors are not provided with them. This, on the one part, proceeds from two tendons of the iirst species be-231 FIBROUS SYSTEM. ing requisite for each finger, and only one for the second, consequently from a greater power being required to maintain the organ in the first direc- tion ; and on the other part, from each extensor tendon giving insertions in its sides to the tendons of the interossei and lumbricales, which re-acting against extensive motions, serve to retain it in its proper place, and thus act as substitutes for the fibrous sheaths-.* Finally, the efforts of the exten- sors are not near so powerful as those of the flexors, the effects of which they are, as it were, intended to limit. SECTION II. ; I General Fibrous Sheaths. The general sheaths are met with in the wrist, and in the instep, where they are termed annular ligaments. They are intended to maintain several united tendons in their re- spective situations. As in these two parts all those of the hand or of the foot have to cross through rather a narrow space, it was indispen- sable they should be properly secured; besides, these sheaths serve also in some cases to change their directions, as may be seen by those that lesort to the thumb, either in its palmar or on its dorsal surface, and which evidently trace an angle on crossing under the sheath. The tendons of the little finger display a similar dispo- sition.FIBROUS SYSTEM. 951C These kinds of sheaths admit of two essential differences; in the one, as in the anterior part of the wrist, every tendon is contiguous with the other, separated only by a kind of loose mem- brane interposed between them ; in the other, as in the posterior part of the wrist under the ge- neral sheath, are found small fibrous partitions that separate each tendon from the other. In ge- neral, the resistance of these t-enekmo is remark- ably powerful. ARTICLE VIII. Aponeuroses. We have divided these organs into two classes, those for envelopements and those for insertions. SECTION i. Aponeuroses for Envelopements. These aponeuroses are either general or partial. Aponeuroses for General Envelopements. These are found round the limbs, wherein they maintain the muscles in their respective situations the arm, fore-arm, and the hand ; the thigh, the leg, and the foot, are provided with them. v# •FIB HO US SYSTEM. <233 Forms. In their conformation, they are analogous with the form of the limb, which in part they shape, and which they particularly support by prevent- ing the displacement of the subjacent parts—an occurrence that, on account of the extreme laxity of the cutaneous organ, would incessantly take place : they vary in thickness ; in general the more numerous the muscles they contain the thicker they are. This explains why the fascia- lata exceeds in this respect that of the fore arm ; why the antibrachial is thicker in the anterior than in the posterior part, why the palmar and the plantar aponeuroses are so voluminous^ whilst a few fibres onlv are disseminated over the back of the hand and foot. This rule, however, ad- mits of some exceptions ; for instance, the aponeu- rotic expansion on the posterior part of the leg is not proportionate with the strength of the gas- trocnemii and of thesoleus; thus are these muscles more frequently than any others exposed to those very painful affections that constitute the cramp, and which ought to be distinguished from the pains or benumbed sensations resulting from the compression of one of the nerves in the inferior extremities, as of the ischiatic, or the external plantar, a compression proceeding from a wrong position, or any other similar cause, &c. Externally, the aponeuroses for general enve-234 FIBROUS SYSTEM, lopement are contiguous with the integuments. They are united to them by a very loose tissue., so that the latter may easily slide over them in ex- terior pressure; immoveable between these mo- tions and those of the muscles, they separate them perfectly, so that the skin and the muscles that correspond to it do not, in this respect, influence each other in the least. Internally, the aponeuroses are generally united to the muscles by cellular tissue in a loose manner. From space to space they project between the different muscular layers numerous elongations, which proceed to be inserted into the bone, and which also, as they give points for insertions, en- sure the solidity 6f the envelopement of the limb. Aponeurotic Tensors. The aponeuroses for general envelopement, are nearly all provided with one or two particular muscles, that are wholly or in part attached to them, and which are intended to impart to them either a degree of tension or of laxity, as required by the state of the muscle. This disposition is remarkable in the insertion ; 1st. Of the latissi- mus dorsi and pectoralis major, with the brachial; 2dly. Of the biceps with the antibrachial; 3dly. Of the palmaris with the palmar aponeurosis; 4thly. Of the muscle of the facia-lata, with the aponeurosis of the same name; 5thly. Of235 FIBROUS SYSTEM. the semi-tendinous, semi-membranosus, and bi- ceps, with the tibial, Ac. As in the extensive motions of the limbs, in which every muscle has the most tendency to be displaced, these are unavoidably called into ac- tion, they strongly distend the aponeuroses; which by that means reflect the motion imparted, and particularly prevent every kind of displacement. Whenever the limb is at rest, the tensors cease to contract, and the aponeurosis is slack- ened. I have observed, that the muscles in- serted into the fibrous capsules, as into that of the humerus, for instance, actually fulfil, in this respect, the functions of extensors with their re- spective aponeuroses. The hue of the latter is a resplendent white ; they differ in this respect from every fibrous or- gan hitherto considered, and are analogous with the tendons, from which however they rather differ in nature: in fact, they resist maceration and ebullition much longer; their fibres are stifler, and more resistant. There are no aponeuroses per- fectly similar to the tendons, except those essen- tially formed by their expansions, or situate at their origin ; such as those extended over the rec- tus fern oris, those that are concealed within the fleshy fibres of a muscle, and which subsequently pass from it to form a tendon. In certain parts of the limbs, as on the upper part of the arm for instance, the aponeuroses for general envelope-FIBROUS SYSTEM. ment are gradually lost in the cellular tissue, without the slightest possibility of the line being drawn. This disposition is almost peculiar to the fibrous system ; at least I know of none which thus interweaves and loses its fibres in the cel- lular tissue ; it is so much the more remarkable, that the nature of each tissue is essentially dif- ferent : they do not give the same products, nor follow the same organic arrangement. The fibres of a general aponeurosis are hardly ever interwoven in more than two or three direc- tions : this disposition of the fibres is generally visible to the naked eye; but 1 have often re- marked, that by immersing an aponeurosis in boil- ing water, and leaving it there for some time, they become still more striking. This observation is also applicable to the whole fibrous system, to these organs particularly, the texture of which being little apparent, seems homogeneous at first glance. In this manner also the fibres of the dura- mater are rendered very distinct. Functions. The habitual ^compression of the aponeuroses over the mcmbiTmtrr, besides the uses already pointed out, has also the effect of forwarding the circulation of the white and red fluids. Thus va- rices, very seldom met with in the deep seated veins that attend the arteries, are excessively nu-FIBROUS SYSTEM. 237 merous in the superficial ones that are not ex- posed to such compression : this we endeavour to supply in the application of tight bandages; from which such advantage is derived in a number of external diseases arising from a defi- ciency of tone, or from a relaxation in the parts. I have constantly noticed, that the serous infil- trations always begin by invading the sub-cuta- neous cellular.tissue ; that in the advanced stages of dropsy, that only which lays below the aponeu- rosis is found infiltrated ; and that in general it never contains the same quantity of serum as the other. In most cases of considerable distensions in dropsical limbs, when the skin has been re- moved and the subjacent fluid suffered to escape, the limb inclosed in its aponeurosis hardly ex- ceeds its natural dimensions. The muscles unpro- vided with these coverings, as those over the sides of the abdomen, for instance, are much sooner in- filtrated. Aponeuroses for partial Envelopement. These aponeuroses are met with in isolated parts ; on the anterior part of the abdomen, on the head, the back, &c. They are generally intended to maintain in their respective stations a certain number of muscles, that are not like the preced- mg, encompassed by them in every direction, but to which they are applied only partially. TheirFIBROUS SYSTKM. 238 thickness is much less than that of the preceding ; it is calculated for the efforts they are intended to bear. All the aponeuroses are provided with ten- sors, that proportion their degree of tension or relaxation to the powers of the adjacent mus- cles. The rectus anterior, by means of its inser- tions, in common with the pyramidalis, fulfil this office in regard to the abdominal aponeuroses ; the serrati minores in respect to that which covers the muscles of the vertebral gutters ; the auricu- lar, the frontal, and the occipital, in respect to the epicranial, &c. The aponeuroses for envelopement, the use of which is exclusively restricted to a single muscle, as that of the temporal for instance, are un- provided with tensors, and are consequently al- ways in the same degree of tension : this pro- bably explains why they have a very tight and thick tissue, as that which I have just men- tioned. In general, the use of all aponeuroses for enve- lopement, whether general or particular, in what relates to compression of the muscles, is ren- dered indispensable by the displacements they would be exposed to in contracting—displacements rendered obvious; 1st. When we place the handover a muscle in action, which is unprovided with an aponeurosis, such as the masseter ; 2dly. When some part of a general aponeurosis having beenFIBROUS SYSTEM. 239 divided in a wound, the subjacent muscles acciden- tally come in contact with the integuments ; 3dly. When the muscles of a limb have been laid bare, and left without any other support than the cel- lular tissue only, and that when left in this state their contraction is excited; dthly. In certain wounds inflicted upon muscles when in a state of contraction, it is very difficult to sound these wounds, because the muscles assuming a. different situation by their relaxation, the connections be- tween the parts that form the edges of the wound are changed, &c. SECTION II. Aponeuroses for Insertion. The aponeuroses for insertion have been divided into three species. Aponeuroses for Insertion, with wide Surfaces. These are very numerous. Sometimes they result from the expansion of a tendon, as in those of the rectus femoris ; at other times, as in the masseter, they borrow their origin immediately from the bone. Sometimes the insertion is ef- fected by one side only, in other instances by both at the same time; and in this case they represent partitions interposed between the fleshy skains, answering at the same time the purpose both of uniting and of separating them, as is ob-FIBROUS SYSTEM. 240 served in the bundles of muscles originating from each of the condyles of the humerus. These aponeuroses always receive the insertions of the fleshy fibres in a very oblique direction ; they are intimately attached to each other—a circumstance I shall notice when treating of the tendons. They afford the great advantage of multiply- ing prodigiously the points of insertion with- out the necessity of increasing the extent of the bony surfaces : the width of the whole temporal fossa would not be sufficient for the masseter if it arose by insulated fibres. By means of the aponeurotic partitions which receive its fibres, and then proceed on to be attached to the bone, its insertion is Concentrated over one of the ridges of the zygomatic arch. Thus every powerful muscle, whose fibres consequently are consider- ably multiplied, are generally traversed by a si- milar aponeurosis ; of which we find instances in the deltoid, the pterygoid muscles, &c. Nearly all of these aponeuroses are perfectly similar to tendons; several are continued with them, and then their fibres follow the same di- rection. Not to have their fibres interwoven in a thousand different directions, like those of the aponeuroses intended for coverings, is in general a distinctive character of this species of aponeu- roses ; the reason of it is very simple : the fleshy fibres they give insertion to being nearly all dis-241 FIBROUS SYSTEM. posed in one direction, or at least these fibres not interweaving, ‘they must necessarily follow the same direction, since they are continued with them. I have tried an experiment, which very evi- dently proves the identity of tendons and aponeu- roses ; it consists in submitting a tendon to ma- ceration for the space of a few days, it then becomes flexible, the fibres separate, and by spreading it in the direction of its thickness, it will form a kind of membrane that cannot possibly be distinguished from a real aponeurosis. Arched Aponeuroses for Insertion. These are much less numerous than the pre- ceding. Whenever a large vessel crosses under a muscle, nature has adopted this means to pre- vent the insertion of the fleshy fibres being inter- rupted ; the diaphragm for the aorta, the soleus for the tibial artery, are instances : the insertion takes place over the convex part, and the vessel crosses under the concavity of the arch, the two extre- mities of which are fixed to the bones. For a long time it was thought that the arteries might be com- pressed under these arches; hence the explanation given of popliteal aneurisms, of apoplexy caused by a reflux towards the head, of the blood ob- structed in its course through the aorta, &c.; but it is most evident, that by contracting, the fleshy VOL. II. RFIBROUS SYSTEM. 242 •*. ■ - fibres must widen the passage, instead of contract- ing it, since the necessary effect of these contrac- tions is to enlarge in every direction the aponeu- rotic curve ; an effect which would be quite the reverse if the insertion took place in the concave side. These kinds of aponeurosis are strongly in- terwoven, and are very resistant. Aponeuroses for Insertion by isolated Fibres. These are an assemblage of numerous small fibrous bodies, all very distinct from each other, that seem to arise from the periosteum in the same manner as the threads of a piece of velvet project from their common texture : each of them is continued with a fleshy fibre, so that when all these fibres have been removed by maceration, these small bodies are left floating, and per- fectly visible, particularly when some periosteum that has been detached is selected for the expe- riment. It will be conceived that this mode of muscu- lar insertion must always require very extensive bony surfaces, since each fibre has its individual allotted place ; as for instance, in the upper por- tion of the iliac, of the anterior tibial, of the temporal, &c. If every muscle followed this mode, a surface tenfold more extensive in the skeleton would not be sufficient for their in- sertions.FIBROUS SYSTEM. 243 ARTICLE IX. Of Tendons. Tendons are a kind of fibrous cords, interposed between the muscles and the bones, transmitting to the latter the motions of the former, and acting in this function completely a passive part. SECTION i. Form of the Tendons. The tendons are generally situate in the ex- tremitiesof the fleshy, ^bundles, but sometimes occupy-thok; ontiro length, as is seen m the di- gastric mus(^ej^they are most generally met with in the furthest moveable extremity, 'm that which acts as a support, aad is provided with aponeuroses for insertion, as is seen particularly in the fore-arm, and in the leg, all the muscles of which arising from the upper part, over a very extensive bony or aponeurotic surface, ter- minate below in a tendon that is more or less minute; from such disposition there results, 1st. Little thickness in the extremity of the limbs, and consequently facility for their motions ; 2dly. Much resistance to exterior pressures, to which, these parts are very frequently exposed, the fibrous tissue being, as we have said, exces- sively resistant; 3dly. The concentration of the R 2FIBROUS SYSTEM. 244 whole power of a muscle, frequently very large, on a small bony surface, and thence the extent and power of the motions of the bone, &c. The tendinous forms are generally cylindrical; undoubtedly, because, in this form there is more substance in less compass ; sometimes, however, as in the tendons of the extensors of the leg, and of the fore-arm, they are flattened. Sometimes the tendons are bifurcated, or divided into several secondary prolongations, at their in- sertion ; or they receive the fleshy fibres in two or even more different points. They are all co- vered with a loose tissue, that admits of their sliding over each other or the adjacent parts with facility. This tissue is sometimes wanting, then the synovial capsules surround them to facilitate their motions. The fleshy fibres pass in different directions toward the points of inser- tion ; sometimes they proceed from one side only, hence the semipenniform muscles ; at other times from both sides at the same time, consti- tuting the penniform muscles. Frequently the tendon imbedded in the centre cannot be laid bare but by a longitudinal section. The adherence between the fleshy fibre and the tendons is very great; however, by submitting them to maceration for some time, or on their undergoing ebullition, they will gradually sepa- rate from each other. I have observed, that in young subjects the adherence was by no meansFIBROUS SYSTEM. 2J5 so excessive: thus by scraping with the scalpel the tendon at that age, the muscle may be sepa- rated from it without any marks being left, the polish where the fibres were implanted, and in other parts, being nearly the same. The end of the tendon fixed to the bone, is generally interwoven with the periosteum by expanding into it; so that it is with this membrane, and not with the bone itself, it is conjoined, because in fact, with that only it is identified by its nature ; thus if it meet with an analogous membrane, it equally unites with it, as is seen in the insertion of the straight and oblique muscles with the tunica scle- rotica, of the ischio and bulbo-cavernouses with the membrane of the corpus cavernosum, &c. In general tendons never unite but with fibrous membranes ; the serous, the mucous, every organ, in a word, that does not belong to the fibrous sys- tem, is foreign to them. SECTION II. Organization of the Tendons. The fibrous tissue is exceedingly tight in ten- dons ; several of them appear homogeneous at first glance ; but on being attentively examined* fibres united by a tight cellular tissue, and in ge- neral not a very abundant one, are soon ob- served. These fibres are very obvious in ebulli-FIBROUS SYSTEM. ‘246 tion: when the tendons are suddenly immersed in boiling water, they become thicker and more apparent in that part where the tendon has been transversely divided. In those parts where they expand to form an aponeurosis to unite with the periosteum, these fibres were distinctly seen with- out any kind of preparation. On the other hand, as a tendon softened and relaxed by maceration, will in this state admit of being converted into an artificial aponeurosis, or will assume any form whatever, maceration must necessarily be a very effectual method of obtaining a proper investiga- tion of the tendinous fibres. In this experiment, so easily repeated, I have never observed that spiral form in the tendinous cylinders of which some modern authors have spoken. These fibres are similarly arranged in a tendon, as they are wherever they separate from it, to form an apo- neurosis, that is to say, in a straight line. Scarcely any blood reaches the vascular system of tendons; but in certain inflammations they are completely permeated with this fluid. I have seen one of those of the extensors laid bare in a whitlow by a country surgeon, so completely red, that it had the appearance of a phlegmon. I have remarked, however, that this hue did not, as in several other organs undergoing inflammation, depend upon a number of small reddish streaks, in- dicating exhaling tubes filled with blood, but that the colour was uniform, resembling a substanceFIBROUS SYSTEM. 217 that has been dyed red. In general it appears, that of all the fibrous system, the tendons are possessed of the least vitality. On dissecting them in a living animal, I found they had exactly the same qualities as in the corpse; the white juices they are permeated with do not flow under the knife, they are dry, and are removed in layers. The temperature appears to be very low ; for in general the degree of heat in an organ is pro- portionate to the quantity of blood vessels it receives. Tf in the body they attain the general tempe- rature, it arises from that of the surrounding or- gans. No caloric is separated in their tissue: the tendons have a remarkable affinity with gelatine, and even with the calcareous phosphate, and in parts where they slide over a bone, and under- go considerable friction, they present a degree of hardness attributed by authors to pressure, com- paring it to the induration in the sole of the foot, but which is evidently owing to an exhalation of the two preceding substances in the tendinous tissue; an exhalation determined by the motion, and from which real ossification results. In this manner, as we have stated, are the different sesamoid bones formed, and particularly the patella, of which the tissue evidently differs from that of others, because, besides the gelatine and earthy substance with which it is penetrated, it has also a portion of fibrous tissue which is notFIBROUS SYSTEM. 248 impregnated with these substances, and which is in such quantity, that its mode of vitality is as much or more allied to the fibrous system than to that of the bones. Besides, when the patella, or any sesamoid bone is removed, there remains on each side a tendinous portion, which being submitted to the action of an acid, is robbed of this saline substance, the fibres of the bones being left bare, and seen continued with the tendon that has been softened by the experiment. The muscles of organic life, the greatest part of those that form the sphincters in animal life, are unprovided with tendons. The white tissue those silver-like cords meet with in the heart, are of a different nature from the tendons of the limbs. ARTICLE X. Ligaments. The ligaments have been divided into those composed of regular and those of irregular fas- ciculi. SECTION i. Ligaments composed of regular Fasciculi. These are generally met with in almost every moveable articulation, especially on the sides; hence the name of ligaments, by which they areI FIBUOUS SYSTEM. 249 designated. Some, however, have no connection with the articulations: as we find instances, in that stretched between the coracoid and acro- mion apophyses, in those which complete the dif- ferent bony notches, the orbitary for example. These organs form bundles, sometimes cylin- drical, at other times flattened, fixed in, or rather interwoven at their extremities with the perios- teum, easily removed with this organ during in- fancy, but adhering to the adult bone by the ossification of the internal lamellee of this mem- brane. Their analogy with tendons is very striking; the external difference consists in their adhering to the periosteum on both sides, whilst it is on one side only the tendons are continuous with the muscles. The same organ is frequently seen to form a tendon at one age, and a ligament at another, a circumstance that is particularly re- marked in the inferior ligament of the patella. These differ also, as we have remarked, in their composition. All the ligaments are formed by an assemblage of fibres parallel in the middle, divergent in the ends, united by a cellular tissue, looser than that of the tendons, and which frequently contains a few flakes of fat; at times they are so abundantly supplied with this substance, that they assume an aspect analogous with the adipose muscles ; this250 FIBROUS SYSTEM •> I have observed in the ligaments of the knee, in a subject otherwise of a very emaciated habit. The ligaments contain a few blood-vessels. In certain diseases of the articulations their vascular system is developed in a very remarkable manner, and they are permeated with a great quantity of blood; no nerves can be discovered. Sometimes the ligamentous tissue is converted into a greasy matter, in which there is no sem- blance of fibres. This matter is very seldom re- stored to its primitive state, and is almost always met with in those organic diseases that prove fatal. The ligaments strongly unite together the ar- ticulating surfaces, prevent their displacement, and yet admit of easy motions ; a twofold function they fulfil in virtue of a twofold property, of their resistance on the one part, of their softness and flexibility on the other : outwardly they sometimes give insertion to a few muscles. SECTION II. Ligaments composed of irregular Fasciculi. These are irregular fibres strewed here and there over the ossified surfaces, without any or- der, interwoven in various directions between the sacrum and os ilium, over the summit of theFIBROUS SYSTEM. 251 acromion, &c. A few of these fibres are also seen irregularly scattered round several moveable articulations; they are separated by a quantity of cellular tissue, and do not admit of general consi- derations. In general, the fibrous system is not so regularly organized in ligaments as it is in tendons, or as the muscular system is in muscles, &c.; in the ligaments, even in those formed by irregular bundles, we frequently see a few fibres straying in different directions, deviating from the principal skain, without following any regular course. /FIBR0-CARTILAG1N0US SYSTEM. The fibro-cartilaginous system is composed of different organs, which anatomists have sometimes classed with the cartilages, at other times with the ligaments, because, in fact, they partake of the nature of both. I have given it a middle state between the two preceding, the knowledge of which will facilitate the investigation of this. ARTICLE I. Forms of the Fibro-Cartilaginous System. The fibro-cartilaginous organs may be divided into three classes, The first includes those that compose the ears, the nostrils, the trachea, the eyelids, &c.; they are very thii^ membranes as it were, sometimes disposed in an uniform manner, sometimes reflected over themselves in various ways. As neither their position nor their functions have any thing uncom- mon, we shall not borrow from these their deno- minations, which shall be derived from their253 FIBRO-CA11TILAGINOUS SYSTEM. forms. These substances may be designated by the words fibro-cartilaginous membranes ; besides, it is not only in the form, but also in the nature, that the parts of this class differ, as we shall per- ceive, from those of the other classes. In the second class are ranked the inter-articu- lar substances, interposed in the interstices of the moveable articulations, whether being partly free in the cavity, such as those of the knee, of the inferior jaw, &c. they move, according to the motions performed by the organ, in different di- rections, or, like those of the body of the ver- tebrae, they are fixed in a solid manner, although moveable over the surfaces of the bones. These organs in general are thicker than the preceding, remarkably variable, presenting commonly la- mellae, sometimes perforated through their cen- tre in the articulating cavities, disposed in very thick bundles, and figured like the body of the vertebrae in the spine. They may be designated by the name of articulating fibro-cartilages. I have allotted to the third class particular por- tions of the periosteum, in which this membrane completely changes its nature, impregnates itself with gelatine, and displays at first an aspect ana- logous to that of the cartilages, but in which, however, the fibrous tissue is easily distinguished. These portions are met with in the tendinous sheaths, in which they facilitate the motion of the tendons, and protect the bones against their254 FIBUO-CART1LAGINOOS SYSTEM. impression. They may be called tibro-cartilages of the tendinous sheaths. These three classes of fibro-cartilages, although extremely analogous, have not exactly the same structure, the same vital properties, or the same vitality j so that the system they form is not so homogeneous in its different divisions as the os- seous system, the muscular system of animal life, &c. ARTICLE II. Organization of the Fi hro - Carti la gin ous System. SECTION I. Tissue proper to the Fibro-Cartilaginous System, The tissue peculiar to the fibro-cartilaginous sys- tem is composed, as its name sufficiently implies, of a fibrous substance, and also of real cartilage. The fibrous substance forms the basis of the organ as it were: this basis is perfectly dis- tinct in the fibro-cartilage of the tendinous grooves, and of the articulations, particularly in those of the body of the vertebrae, but is not near so apparent in the membranous fibro-cartilages. Sometimes it is interwoven, at other times dis- posed in a parallel direction. In general its nature is absolutely the same as in the fibrous system, hard, resistant, dense and tight: hence255 FIB RO-C A UTIL ACINOUS SYSTEM. the great powers with which the different organs of this system are endowed : hence again ; 1st. The solidity with which the vertebrae are secured together; 2dly. The difficulty with which the fibro-cartilages of the knee, of the jaw, of the clavicle, &c. are ruptured or lacerated; 3dly. The resistance which the ulna opposes to the in- ferior luxations of that bone, luxations which in strong pronations have the utmost tendency to take place, and which cannot be effected without the rupture of this fibro-cartilage. I have wit- nessed an instance of such a displacement that had never been reduced, in which the fibro-carti- lage had completely disappeared; 4thly. On bending the real cartilages they will break ex- actly like a radish ; these organs, on the con- trary, bend in every direction, and resist the agents that distend them ; 5thly. Imprudent men are seen lifting up children by the ears, the fibro- cartilages of that organ sustaining the whole weight of the body. I am convinced those of the nose would bear the same attempt; Gthly. It is sufficiently known, that in aneurisms of the tho- racic or abdominal aorta, the bodies even of the vertebrae are much sooner destroyed, and conse- quently that they afford less resistance than their uniting substances. The cartilaginous part seems interposed, as it were, in the fibres, the interstices of which it fills up* It is very evident, particularly in the arti-256 fibro-cartilaginous system. culating fibro-cartilages, and in those of the grooves: from this they borrow the white hue by which they are characterized, the organic as- pect displayed by their sections in various parts, and the elasticity specially allotted to them. When undergoing ebullition, the articulating fibro-carti- lages, like those of the tendinous-grooves, become yellow, transparent, and diffuse into gelatine, though with much more difficulty than the real cartilages. In respect to the membranous fibro-cartilages of the ear, the nose, the trachea, the epiglottis, and the eye-lids, their composition seems very diffe- rent. They are not reduced to a gelatinous state by the action of boiling water, in a sensible man- ner at least ; they remain white, are but indiffe- rently softened, present quite a different aspect from that of a fibrous organ, or from the other fibro-cartilages that have undergone ebullition, and that liquify after becoming yellow and semi- transparent. The simple inspection of the ears of animals dressed for our meals, evidently proves this fact, which I have also repeatedly ascertained in my experiments. I know but few tissues in the economy that resemble this. When it has under- gone ebullition for some length of time, the kind of periosteum that covers it falls off, and the car- tilage itself splits and cracks in different places : the rings of the trachea especially, afford us in- stances of this last phenomenon.FIBUO-CAUTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 257 When exposed a few days to maceration, this tissue, white as it was, becomes strikingly red. The hue is darker than that acquired by the car- tilages of ossification from immersion in water. Does this proceed from the same causes ? I do not know. When the intervertebral fibro-cartilages are submitted to maceration, their fibrous lamellae also assume that reddish tint I have never ob- served in the other articulating fibro-cartilages, particularly in those of the knee. The membranous fibro-cartilages are rendered hard and brittle by desiccation; they do not as- sume the yellow colour of dried tendons and apo- neuroses, but have quite a peculiar aspect. In undergoing the same experiment, the inter- vertebral substances acquire a very remarkable transparency, different also from that of the fibrous system, but without any yellow hue. These substances, in the first days of their maceration, when they have been completely removed from their vertebrae, swell and rise, forming a kind of hollow cone, the summit of which is represented by the centre which swells considerably, and the basis formed by the circumference that remains in its natural state. The greater part of the fibro-cartilages are in general unprovided with a perichondrium : this is evident in those of the tendinous grooves, in which the bone on one side, and the synovial VOL. II. s258 FIBROCARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. membrane on the other, enclose the organ ; in those of the articulations which this membrane sur- rounds on both sides ; and in those of the vertebrae, to which the posterior and anterior ligaments only correspond. In regard to the membranous fibro- cartilages, they are covered with a very distinct fibrous tissue, which is thick, adheres strongly to the proper tissue of the membrane, is easily dis- covered in maceration, which whitens it very evi- dently, and thus renders it completely distinct from /the fibro-cartilaginous tissue found in the middle. By splitting a fibro-eartilage of the ear, of the nose, that of the epiglottis, &c. after they have remained in the water, this fact is made obvious; particularly if the experiment be tried whilst they remain still possessed of the hue I have mentioned. The fibro cartilaginous system appears to have nearly the same connections with the gastric juices, as the fibrous and cartilaginous systems have, the nature of which they partake of; in the raw state these juices can scarcely act upon them. They yield much sooner when softened by boiling, being converted into a digestible food. In general this food is less nutritious than that produced by many other systems.259 FIBRO-CA RTILAG1NOUS SYSTEM. SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Fibro-Cartilaginous System. The organs in common of the fibro-cartilages are not very striking; they are but sparingly supplied with cellular tissue, which is so very dense in these parts it is hardly discernible, but is rendered very apparent by maceration. In the natural state their vascular system con- tains but little blood. I have ascertained this by dis- secting an animal purposely killed by strangula- tion, a state in which the blood accumulating in the capillaries interposed between the arteries and the veins, particularly towards the head, renders these vessels excessively apparent; but in inflammation, which seldom affects the fibro-cartilages, they are much injected. No nerves can be traced. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Fihro-Cartilaginous System. Physical Properties. Elasticity essentially belongs to this system. This property is evidently proved ; 1st. In the fibro-cartilages of the ears, whenever they are bent; 2dly. In those of the nose, whenever s 2FIBROCARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 260 they are twisted in different ways; 3dly. In those of the trachea when they are compressed, or divided longitudinally, we separate the di- vided part, as is practised in tracheotomy, for the purpose of extracting a foreign substance. It fulfils an important office in that kind of vibration of the former organs in the per- ception of sounds • of the latter, in the pro- duction of voice; and 4thly. It is in conse- quence of elasticity that the articulating fibro- cartilages serve as a kind of cushions, which, by compressing and swelling again, accommodate the motions of the bony surfaces to which they correspond ; 5thly. That those of the vertebrae, in particular, depressed during the day, re-act during rest, and thus render the stature in the morning in some degree superior to that at night. Finally. In the sliding of tendons over their fibro-carti- © lages, the elasticity of the latter promotes mo- tion in an evident manner. This elasticity in the fibro-cartilages is united with a very remarkable degree of suppleness, for they will bend in every direction without break- ing. By the first property they belong particu- larly to the cartilaginous system ; by the latter, they approach the fibrous : it is by no means asto- nishing that, being by their tissue as intermediate to these two systems, they should likewise be so by their properties.2G1 F1BR0-CAR TILAGINOUS SYSTEM. SECTION II. Properties of the Tissue. Extensibility is frequently excited in the Ebro-cartilaginous tissue. I have witnessed a polypus that had so far dilated the anterior open- ings, and consequently the fibro-cartilages of the nostrils, that their diameter was at least trebled. The auditory canal, from a similar cause, fre- quently displays a similar distension. In the dif- ferent distortions to which the spine is liable, that portion of the fibro-cartilages corresponding to the convex part of the curves, is very evidently lengthened, whilst that part opposed to it is de- pressed, &c. This extensibility besides, is sub- mitted, in numerous cases, to the very same law that governs it in the fibrous system ; that is to say, it cannot be brought to act, but in a slow and insensible manner. % The contractility of the tissue is obvious, when m the cases I have just been mentioning, the cause of distension has ceased. Thus subsequent to the extraction of the before mentioned poly- pus, the nostril was gradually restored to its na- tural state. In a dog I have removed a tendon from its sheath, by parting it at one end, and drawing it by the other, so as to leave the con- taining sheath entire and uninjured : this sheathFIBROCARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 262 and the fibro-cartilage contracted by degrees* and the cavity became obliterated. In carcino- ma of the eye, where the eyelids are not re- moved, the tarsus with which the palpebree had been considerably extended, gradually contract and re-assume their primitive state ; besides, these phenomena should be perfectly distinguished from those which result from elasticitv : the lat- * ter are quick and abrupt: strongly distended, the fibro-cartilage yields in some degree, and abruptly re-assumes its primitive and natural position; the others, on the contrary, are the most fre- quently characterized by their remarkably slow progress. section in. Vital Properties. Every vital property is very obscure in the fibro-cartilages ; no such a thing as animal sensi- bility or contractility is to be met with in the na- tural state : the first property, however, is deve- loped by inflammation ; for they are possessed of organic sensibility and insensible contractility, in such a degree only as is indispensable for nutri- tion. Sensible organic contractility is completely wanting in this system. This obscurity in the vital properties necessi-FIB R 0-C A K T1L A G1N OU S SVST EM. 2 63 tates a remarkably slow progress in the develope- ment of the phenomena produced in the organs now under consideration. X have obsei ved, that after the ears of a dog have been divided by a longitudinal section, if the edges of the section be brought and kept in contact by one or two stitches, the two parts of the skin will in a few days be perfectly re-united; but the re-union of the cartilage under this will require a much longer time to be effected, as may be ascertained by ex- amining the parts subsequent to the re-union of the integuments. I presume the very same thing would happen in the operation of tracheotomy practised in former days, in which the soft parts, undergoing first cicatrization, keep in contact the cartilaginous semi-rings, which ultimately became agglutinated. To this obscurity of vital properties in the fibre-cartilages, and to their want of energy, must undcubtedlv also be attributed the scarcity of * * diseases that affect these organs. X know of few organic systems in the animal economy, more sel- dom affected than that of the fibro-cartilages of the nose, of the ear, trachea, &c. They are scarcely susceptible of gangrene; for whilst the surround- ing parts are already quite black, they are hardly changed. The nature of the fluid they emit in suppuration is not yet known, and suppuration itself, from a want of vital activity, is very rare in these organs.FIBRO-CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 264 As they are hardly ever diseased, scarcely any thing can be said of their sympathies. I could not quote a single instance. ARTICLE IV. Developement of the Fibro-Cartilaginous System, SECTION i. State of that System in the early Age. In the early period of our existence, the arti-^ culating fibro-cartilages are tolerably developed, owing probably to the width of the articulations at that time. In fact, as the extremities of bones are proportionally much larger, whilst they re- main cartilaginous, than when they have become ossified, the articulations also are proportionally much larger, and the organs they contain more striking. The fibro-cartilages of insertions, nearly all situated as is sufficiently known, at the extremi- ties of the long bones, are not in the early stage of life distinct from the cartilages of ossification that form these ends at that age. Confused to- gether, no distinctive line is to be seen when the bone is divided on a level with them. This state subsists until ossification is com- pleted 5 then the fibro-cartilages of insertions,*FIBRO-CAUTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 26& as well as those of the ends of bones, remain separate. The gelatinous part interposed, appears to pre- dominate in the infant, in the articulating fibro- cartilages, and in those for insertion, over the fibrous part. This is remarkable in the interver- tebral substances, wherein that kind of mucilage which occupies the centre, and in which the fibres also are more striking, is in a reverse state with age in respect to quantity. In the foetus al- most every thing is homogeneous in the pubis, for the transverse fibres become apparent in a more advanced age only. The articulations of the knee, the jaw, &c. display the very same disposi- tion in their fibro-cartilages. A greater quantity of gelatine is then extracted from them, and by ebullition they have the more of that smooth aspect that characterizes the cartilages. The membranous fibro-cartilages, as those of the ear, of the eyes, and especially of the nose, are in general formed at an early period : they are very striking in the foetus. In two ascephali, I have observed, that here, as in every other part of the head, they were of a very remarkable size, much exceeding the natural state. Besides, the whole fibro-cartilaginous system is in the foetus remarkably soft, supple, and binding.FIBRO-CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 266 SECTION II. State of the Fibro-Cartilaginous System in the subsequent Ages. This system gradually acquires consistence as age advances. In old age it grows hard, yielding with difficulty from the peculiar nature its nutritive substances assume. To this circumstance must be referred; 1st. The stiffness and inflexibility of the spine, in which the fibro-cartilages maintain the component parts in a state of immobility as it were ; 2dly. In part the deafness which affects the aged subject, the tympanum being incapa- ble of vibrating and of reflecting sounds; 3dly. His nostrils admitting of less dilatation, their fibro-cartilages opposing more resistance to the muscular effort, which itself is also reduced; 4thly. The difficulty that attends the gliding of tendons, their sheaths being much stiffer. In old age, the fibro-cartilages have in general less tendency to ossification than the cartilages properly so called. I have never seen this pheno- menon in the membranous ones: in such subjects it may proceed from that particular texture, and even from the difference of their component principles, or from the small quantity of gelatine they are found to contain. Amongst the articu-FIBROCARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 267 lating cartilages, those of the vertebrae only will admit of ossification, which, however, is very sel- dom the case. Those of the grooves are like the cartilages of the moveable articulations, they con- stantly preserve their nature : in extreme old age, however, their thickness seems to be rather re- duced by the ossification of their lamellae that correspond to the bone, which is also very trifling.MUSCULAR SYSTEM 268 MUSCULAR SYSTEM OF ANIMAL LIFE. * The general muscular system is evidently di- vided into two parts, essentially differing from each other in the vital powers, by which they are animated, in their exterior forms, their mode of organization, and above all, in the func- tions they fulfil; the one in animal life, the other in the organic life. We shall consider them se- parately. Let us begin with the muscles of ani- mal life: these are distributed with profusion in the human body, and no other system occupies more space in the economy. Besides the numerous re- gions that are over-run with muscles, they are extensively distributed under the skin, sharing, as it were, the functions of that organ, protecting, like the latter, the subjacent parts; and similar to it also, enduring external mechanical action, admitting even of being divided to a greater or less extent, without the general functions of life being essentially injured ; by which it is well adapted to protect the organs deeply situate, the injuries of which might be attended with dread- ful consequences.OF animal life. 269 ARTICLE I. Forms of the Muscular System of Animal Life. In what regards their exterior forms, the mus- cles, like the bones, may be divided into long, wide, and short muscles. Their disposition varies according to these three general descriptions. SECTION i. Forms of the Long Muscles. The long muscles in general are placed in the limbs, to the conformation of which theirs is ac- commodated. Separated from the skin by apo- neuroses, from the bone by the periosteum, they are contained in a kind of fibrous funnel, as it were, which strictly maintains them in their re- spective situations, and in which they are disposed in layers more or less numerous: the deepest are fixed in their places by the uppermost, these are in turn confined by the aponeuroses. In these they are remarkably long; commonly they belong to the motions of three or four bones, and even to more; as the sartorius, the semi-ten- dinous and semi-membranous, the biceps, the flexors, and the extensors afford instances of. In proportion as they are deeper seated, they also be- come shorter, and are generally restricted to twoMUSCULAR SYSTEM 270 bones ; as we find in the brachialis internus, the adductors, the pectinoei, &c. They are separated by cellular layers; loose in parts, in which extensive motions are performed ; tight wherever these motions are more confined, and very thick where vessels and nerves glide under the muscular fasciculi. These are frequently separated from each other by a greater or less space filled with cellular tissue. The long muscles have been divided into single and compound; single when composed of an isolated skain only ; compound when they result from the assemblage of several. These fasciculi then act in two dif- ferent ways; sometimes, in fact, it is in the su- perior part the division is seen, as in the brachial and femoral biceps; at other times it is interiorly : in the most moveable part the division is met with, as in the flexors and extensors of the leg, and of the fore-arm. The long muscles frequently separated from each other, are sometimes held together by inter- posed aponeuroses, which confound together more or less of two, three, and even four of these adjoining organs. The origin of the muscles of the internal and external tuberosities of the hu- merus, are thus disposed, and hence, in the ge- neral motions of the limbs, essential advantage is derived. Then, in fact, the contraction of each muscle acts in moving, below, the moveable point to which it is inserted, and in securing, above, theOF ANIMAL LTFE. 271 fixed point of the adjacent muscles which contract at the same moment. Every long muscle generally considered, is thicker in its middle than at its ends ; a form ow- ing to the mode in which the fleshy fibres are at- tached, which arising above and terminating below successively over each other, are so much the less numerous as they are viewed nearer to each ex- tremity, whilst in the middle they are every one of them in juxta-position ; the rectus anterior, the supinator longus, the external radials, &c. evi- dently display this mode of conformation. There is another peculiar species of long mus- cles, which claim not the slightest analogy with the muscles of the limbs, except in outward ap- pearance. These are extended anterior, and parti- cularly posterior to the spine. Although apparently single at first glance, they are composed of as many distinct skains as there are vertebrae. The transverso spinalis dorsi, the longus colli, the sacro- lumbalis, &c. actually display a lengthened skain, as the sartorius, the rectus anterior of the thigh, <&c.; but the structure of this has nothing in common with that of these muscles ; they are a continuation of minute skains, distinct both in their origins and terminations, and which seem a single muscle only, because they are placed to- gether.272 MUSCULAR SYSTEM. SECTION II. Forms of the Wide Muscles. The wide muscles are generally situate in the parieties of cavities in the animal economy; es- pecially those of the chest and of the abdomen. These parieties are partly formed by them ; they protect the internal organs, and at the same time, by their motions, they facilitate their functions. They are not very thick ; the greatest part of them representing muscular membranes,sometimes disposed by layers, as in the abdomen ; at other i times applied over the long muscles, as in the back ; in the first instance they are more extended as they are examined more superficially. When a wide muscle arises from and termi- nates in one of the great cavities, it preserves in all parts nearly the same width, because there are wide surfaces for insertion ; but if from a ca- vity it extends to a long bone, to an apophysis of a short extent, the fibres concentrate by degrees; it grows narrower and thicker, and terminates in an angle, succeeded by a tendon, which contracts into a very narrow compass the fibres largely disseminated on the sides of the cavity. The great dorsal and pectoral muscles are in- stances of this disposition; which is also met with in the pyriformis, the gluteus medius, mini- mus, &c. ; the wide muscles of the pectoral cavityOF ANIMAL LIFE. 27£> have a peculiar disposition in consequence of the ribs; they derive their origin from flat strings fixed to these bones, and separated by the inter- stices that are left between them. Most commonly the wide muscles are single ones; several are rarely united to form com- pound muscles : similar to the long muscles they are separated by different cellular layers, but are seldom, like the latter, covered by aponeuroses ; the greatest number of them are placed immedi- ately below the integuments; the reason is, that by their forms they are naturally secured against those displacements that have been mentioned when speaking of the aponeuroses, and to which, were it not for these membranes, the muscles of the long bones would be so frequently exposed. I have never heard that the cramp has ever been felt in these muscles. When by dividing the integuments of a living animal, the abdominal muscles are laid bare, I have observed, that on contracting, the whole of each preserves its sta- tion. section in. t Fonns of the Short Muscles. The short muscles are those in which the three dimensions, nearly equal, display a thickness in pi oportion to their width and length. They are commonly met with in parts where considerable VOL. II. rpMUSCULAR SYSTEM 274< power on the one hand, and a limited extent of motion on the other, are required: thus around the temporo-maxillary articulation there are the % masseter and the pterygoid muscles, around ; the ischio-femoral, the quadratics, the gemelli, even the obturators, &c.; around the scapula-humoral articulation, the infra spinalis and rhomboideus minor ; in the hand, the muscles of the thenar and hypothenar eminences ; in the foot, various fleshy skains ; in the spine, the interspinales ; on the head, the little and great anterior, posterior, and lateral recti, will all display with more or less regularity the forms we are examining, and answer the two- fold purpose I have alluded to ; on the one part by the very great number, on the other by the short- ness of their fibres. The short muscles are more frequently than the wide united together, either in their origin, or in their termination, as is seen in the foot, in the hand, &c. Sometimes they assume a triangu- lar form, as is observed in these two parts ; at other times they approach the cubical figure, of which the pterygoid muscles and the masseters are instances: they are seldom covered with aponeuroses, undoubtedly because, by the short- ness of their fibres they are not otherwise ex- posed to considerable displacements; besides the division of the muscles into long, wide, and short, is similar to that of the bones, liable to a multiplicity of modifications. Several of theseOF ANIMAL LIFE. 275 organs, in fact, assume a compound character; thus the sub-scapularis, the infra spinalis, are in- termediate to the wide and short forms; thus cannot the crural, the gastrocnemii, be referred either to the wide or to the short muscles. Na- ture varies according to the functions the organs are intended to perform; the conformation of their impulsive agents and its progress admit of no- thing more than approximations in our anatomi- cal divisions. ARTICLE II. Organization of the Muscular System of Animal Life. That part peculiar to the muscle, is what is commonly called the muscular fibre ; the parts in common are composed of the vessels, the nerves, the exhalents and absorbents, and the cellular tissue met with in abundance round these fibres. SECTION i. Tissue peculiar to the Organization of the Muscular System of Animal Life. The muscular fibre is red, soft, uniform in thickness in the large and small muscles, some- times disposed in very apparent bundles, sepa- rated from each other by very remarkable fur- t 2MUSCULAR SYSTEM 276 rows, as in the gluteus major, the deltoid, See.; at other times in more regular apposition, as in the greatest number of wide muscles, con- stantly united with several other fibres of a si- milar nature; a union that is very apparent to the naked eye, but inscrutable even with the assist- ance of the glass, from its excessive tenuity, when submitted to inspection in an insulated manner : notwithstanding this excessive tenuity, number- less researches have been tried in the last century to determine with certainty the volume of this fibre. I refer on this head to the works of Leuwenoek, Muysk, &c. I shall not mention here the result of their researches, because it can be of no use to science, and their correctness cannot be relied upon; besides, what have we to do with the precise dimension of the muscular fibre ? its investigation could add nothing to the physiological notions respecting the motions of these organs. Every muscular fibre over-runs its distance with- out separating or dividing in any manner what- ever, notwithstanding that many have asserted this to be the case; it is merely in juxtaposi- tion with the adjoining ones, and by no means interwoven, as is frequently the case in the fibrous system; a disposition necessitated by the isolated motions it is commissioned to per- form ; for the general contraction of a muscle, is the assemblage of innumerable partial con-277 OF ANIMAL LIFE. tractions, all very distinct and independent of each other. The length of the fleshy fibre varies to an astonishing degree. If the mass they form by their assemblage be generally examined, it will be observed, this mass is sometimes further ex- tended than the tendinous part of the muscle, such as in the biceps, in the coraco-brachialis, in the rectus internus femoris ; that it is sometimes much shorter, as in the palmaris plantaris, &c. and on other occasions in nearly an equal propor- tion with it, as in the external radials, &c. If from this investigation we proceed to that of the individual fibres of which it is composed, the length of the former will seldom be found equal to that of the latter. There are scarcely any but the sartorius, and a few other similar muscles, in which the fibres are always seen to over-run the whole extent of the fleshy mass; in almost all the other muscles they are disposed in an oblique direction between two aponeuroses, or between a tendon and an aponeu* rosis; so that, although each of them are rather short, their assemblage forms a mass of some ex- tent, as is observed in the rectus anterior femoris, in the semi-membranous, &c. This disposition may also result from the different tendinous inter- sections which are placed at different distances in the course of the fibres. In general the mus- cles that derive their length from long fibres,MUSCULAR SYSTEM 278 have a considerable extent, and very little power of motion; whilst those provided with short fibres only, but excessively multiplied, so as to insure to the whole a considerable length, are re- markable for a reverse disposition.The reason is as follows: As every fibre being equal in thickness, let its length be what it may, has the same degree of strength, it is evident that the aggregate of this power in a muscle, must be measured by the number of its fibres. On the other hand, the longer the fibre the more it will shorten on contracting; then by contraction, the body of a muscle is drawn nearer to the two points of at- tachment, in proportion to the length of its fibres. All the fibres of the voluntary muscles are straight, the sphincters excepted ; they lay ei- ther parallel to each other, as the rhomboidei, or obliquely, as in the pectoralis major. Sometimes in the same muscle, several layers crossing each other following different directions, are seen, as we find, in the masseter; but this intersection is quite different from that met with in the invo- luntary muscles, wherein a plexus of fibres is also seen, whilst in this instance fasciculi follow- ing different directions, placed in apposition, only are to be found. I shall not at present speak of the cylindrical form, according to some, or the globular form, according to others, assumed by the fleshy fibre.279 OF ANIMAL LIFE. Inspection proves nothing' of the kind. Why then has this been made an object of research, and opinions without foundation been produced ? The same remark is applicable to the intimate nature of this fibre upon which so much has been written; it is still unknown to us; and all that has been said respecting its continuation with the vascular and nervous organs, respecting the ca- vity filled with marrow, it was affirmed by some to contain, &c. is nothing more than a mass of incoherent ideas, supported by no positive fact, and unworthy of claiming a moment’s attention. Let us begin to study nature where she comes within the cognizance of our senses. Such ana- tomical researches as have had the intimate struc- ture of the organs in view, I compare with those physiological researches on the primitive causes of the functions. In both we are without a guide, without any correct notions, why then should we dwell upon them ? All we know respecting the nature of the mus- cular fibre is, that it differs from others, that it cannot be compared either with that of the nerves os vessels, nor with that of tendons, or of the cellular tissue. Now we shall find, that in this point of view, all these systems differ essen- tially from each other, that consequently there cannot exist the slightest analogy between them ln what regards their nature from which the pro-? perties are constantly derived.280 MUSCULAR SYSTEM The muscular tissue is remarkable for its soft- ness and want of resistance. This is what essen- tially distinguishes it from the fibrous tissue. It is easily ruptured in the corpse, but not without difficulty in the living subject, because the state of contraction produced by violent exertions, provides it with a degree of density from which it borrows a considerable power of resistance, of which it is deprived as soon as that state of contraction is discontinued. There are, however, some instances of rupture in muscles; they have chiefly been observed in the straight and square muscles of the abdomen. In the latter I have seen one myself. We should notice, that this mus- cle, and all those situate between the ribs and the pelvis, have from their situation a great tendency to become ruptured. In fact, whenever the pelvis and the chest are bent in opposite directions, these muscles are more violently stretched, be- cause in such motions the whole upper part of the body, in common with the chest, acts as a very powerful lever, which moves in a reverse sense to another powerful lever, formed by the pelvis and all the inferior parts. Now these levers, consi- dering their extent, are capable of a very consi- derable motion, consequently of communicating it to the abdominal muscles that are stretched between, and serve to unite them. This ex- plains why the quadratus of the left side may be ruptured by a violent inclination of the right, &c.OF ANIMAL LIFE. 281 Let us remark that few muscles in the economy are interposed between two such powerful levers, consequently not liable to be so excessively dis- tended, and particularly by a power much supe- rior to that of their contraction; for every mus- cular rupture naturally supposes an excess of ex- ternal motion, that distends over that of the fleshy fibres, which contract to resist the distension. If external efforts were concentrated in a single muscle, they would more frequently overcome the resistance ; but in general, several partake in the effort to support, and in the resistance to be opposed. Composition of the Muscular Tissue. The muscular tissue has been for the chemist a more especial object of study, than the greatest number of the other organic tissues. It has been examined in every way. I shall refer to the works of chemistry, particularly to that of Fourcroy, for all that does not strictly relate to the nature of the tissue ; for all that may regard the conse- quences inapplicable to physiology, and that may be drawn from a knowledge of the principles which may constitute its component parts. Exposed to the action of air, the muscular tis- sue is acted upon in two different ways; 1st. If cut in thin slices it dries, admitting of a quick evaporation of the fluids it contains. It is then of a dark brown colour ; its fibres are compressed282 MUSCULAR SYSTEM together, and it becomes thinner, harder, and brittle. When after a few days, even after fifteen or thirty, subsequent to desiccation, it is again immersed in water, it will re-assume its primi- tive form and softness, and a lighter hue. The water that has been employed has a more or less offensive smell, similar to that proceeding from the fluid employed in maceration ; 2dly. If ex- posed in too considerable a mass to the contact of air, the muscular tissue does not become dry, it putrefies. Thus in making dried anatomical pre- parations, great care is taken to reduce the thick- ness of the fleshy layers, or to dispose them in such a manner as will allow the air to penetrate in every direction. If the air be damp, or if the evaporation has not been sufficiently rapid, pu- trefaction is the necessary result. In putrefying, the muscles acquire a green aspect, a livid hue, and exhale a foetid smell. Under similar cir- cumstances they putrefy much quicker than the fibrous, the cartilaginous, and fibro-cartila- ginous substances. The smell is also very dif- ferent from that exhaled from these systems: sometimes a phosphoric spark is produced. A thick putrelage, in which there is no semblance of fibre, is formed when the progress of putre- faction is far advanced ; by degrees this putre- lage is partly evaporated, and there remains a dark brown residue, which on drying becomes hard and brittle, nearly the same as the muscle283 OF ANIMAL LIFE. that has undergone desiccation in the ordinary way, although the aspect is quite different. Submitted to the action of water, the muscles display different phenomena, according to its temperature. Cold water first deprives it of its reddish hue, the principal of which it seems to dissolve. To produce this phenomenon rapidly, the flesh should be exposed in thin layers to the action of water frequently renewed ; by placing it, for instance, under the cock of a fountain, the stream of a river, or what is preferable, by re- peatedly draining it by pressing out the water with which it is permeated, for if it be kept in a jug, it will become white externally, but re- tain its colour within. The water used to wash a muscle is red, and appears as if blood had been mixed with this fluid ; it contains the colouring substance, and a small quantity of extractive matter, some gelatine, &c. Of all the organs, the muscle, I believe, is most readily deprived of its colour by artificial means. Ought we then to be surprized if nature so frequently and so evidently causes this hue to vary in the phenomena of nu- trition, as we shall soon have occasion to remark. Preserved in water of a moderate temperature, the muscular tissue is a long time in softening; eventually, however, it softens, and is succes- sively, layer by layer, converted into a kind of putrelage, very distinct, however, from that pro- duced in the open air, as I have frequently hadmuscular system 284 occasion to observe, by macerating the muscles in a cellar where the temperature undergoes no variations. At other times, instead of putrefying thus, the muscle, as Fourcroy has very correctly observed, is converted into a substance similar to spermaceti, then the fibre is hard and solid ; but every muscle preserved in water, is very far from displaying this phenomena. Frequently when it is undergoing this change, a kind of reddish pro- duct is disseminated from space to space over the surface of the muscle, an evident effect of decomposition, announcing and subsequently at- tending this state, which, however, is frequently effected without it. Maceration in our dissecting rooms affords numerous instances of it. When by repeated washing, the muscles have been deprived of their colouring matter, there remains a white fibrous tissue, from which may also be extracted by ebullition, albumine, . that rises in the form of scum, gelatine, collected on cooling, a portion of extractive matter deeply coloured on concentrating, and a few phosphoric salts. When all these substances have been ex- tracted, the residue of the muscle consists of a fibrous substance, greyish, insoluble in hot water ? soluble by acids, producing a quantity of azote, by the action of nitric acid, and possessed of every character of the fibrine of the blood. It appears, as Fourcroy has judiciously observed, that this is actually the nutritive substance of the muscle,OF ANIMAL LIFE. 285 that which incessantly exhaled and absorbed, con- tributes more than all the rest to its vital phe- nomena ; it constitutes the essence of the mus- cle, that is its principal characteristic, as the phosphate of lime is the characteristic nutritive substance of bones. Is this substance formed in the blood, and from thence conveyed to the mus- cle, or is it produced in the organ itself, by nu- trition, and from the muscle conveyed to the blood ? I cannot determine. Whatever may be the case, its exhalation and absorption seem to undergo innumerable varieties : the state of laxity, that of cohesion, the appearances of the muscular tissue varied ad infinitum, seem to be partly owing to these varieties of proportions : thus does the calcareous phosphate or gelatine, reduced by nutrition, impart to the bone softness or friability. In this fibrous and essential part of the muscle, particularly, resides the faculty of twisting by the action of caloric, either on immersing the muscle in boiling water, or on exposing it to fire ; for this shrinking is as evident in the muscle deprived of its colouring matter, of its gelatine, of its albu- mina, and even of a portion of its extractive sub- stance, as in the common muscle. There is in general a constant connection between the quan- tity of this fibrous substance contained in mus- cles, and that of the blood. In strong, hardy, and sanguine constitutions, as they are termed, the muscles are thicker and much more fibrous.MUSCULAR SYSTEM 286 In all cases of cachexia, in which the blood is im- poverished, the pulse small and feeble, in which muscular nutrition has had time to suffer from a deficiency of fibrine in the blood, the muscles are small, weak, soft, &c. In general, the muscles and the blood are constantly in an uninterrupted connection, whilst other systems frequently pre- dominate, even when this fluid seems deficient in the economy. On undergoing continued ebullition, as the meat for instance boiled for our meals, the muscular tissue still adhering to the adjacent organs, to its parts in common, produces; 1st. An albuminous scum, which seems to depend more upon the lymph in the cellules, than upon the muscle itself; Sndly. Numerous small greasy drops also, especially proceeding from the cellular tissue, consequently nearly unconnected with that of the muscle, and floating over the surface ; 3rdly. Gelatine, par- ticularly formed by the aponeurotic intersections; 4thly. An extractive substance, which partly colours the liquid, gives it a peculiar flavour and remains partly adherent to the meat, to which it communi- cates a deep colour very different from that of raw meats,which depends upon the colouring substance of the muscle, and which besides changes when the meat is cooled, to a lighter and even to a whitish hue ; 5thly. Different salts, that impart to the liquid a flavour, which the chemists have noticed. Such are the natural effects of boiling the muscles.287 OF ANIMAL LIFE. It is not my intention to make a farther analysis of boiled meat; but what ought not to be passed un- noticed here, are the phenomena that are seated in the fibre, during the extraction of the preceding product either from this organ or from the ad- jacent tissues. j These phenomena may be referred to three periods; 1st. Prior to ebullition, as long as the water is only gently warm, even rather under the temperature of natural heat, the muscular tissue is merely somewhat softened; 2ndly. When the water is almost boiling, and an albuminous scum begins to form upon the surface of the water, the muscle shrinks, contracts, and acquires a degree of density, much superior to that of its natural state, and its resistance is considerably increased. I have ascertained that in this state muscles will bear a much greater weight than in their natural state. They have more of that remarkable den- sity, by which they are characterized during contraction in the living subject, and which so effectually prevents their being ruptured. This condensation of the muscular tissue suddenly produced rather increases until the time of ebul- lition, when it has attained its utmost degree, at which it remains stationary for some time ; 3rdly. By degrees this density decreases, the fibres become softer, and are lacerated with more facility than in their natural state. This softening, quite the reverse of the preceding state, is slowly and288 MUSCULAR SYSTEM \ gradually produced. When it has attained a certain degree, our food is sufficiently prepared for the table. We must remark, the muscle has not then been restored to the state it was in pre- vious to that of condensation. Amongst other phenomena that distinguish it perfectly from the latter, the following is very essential: it has lost the faculty of curling and becoming hard, either when under the influence of strong concentrated acids, as under that of alcohol, or particularly when again exposed to a high degree of caloric. In general it does not purify so readily, and its flavour, as is sufficiently known, is quite different. The loss of its principles by ebullition, is undoubt- edly one of the essential causes of these changes. When the muscle is exposed to the naked fire, as in roasting,the albumine condenses, the gelatine melts, the fibrine permeated with juices softens, the extractive substance, together with gelatine, and the dissolved salts, partly run from the organ: this is what constitutes gravy, which, as is suffi- ciently known, is very different from melted fat. The exterior of the meat is more solid than the interior; it is coloured by the extractive substance. The interior partly loses its natural hue: its consistence, taste, and even its composition, are completely changed. The fibres, as in ebullition, lose the power of shrinking and of curling from strong stimulants, particularly from fire. No part of the animal economy is sooner affectedOF ANIMAL LIFK. 289 by the gastric juices, than the muscles. Boiled muscle is received by almost all animals, whilst many will reject other organs that have been cooked. The carnivorous species feed on the muscles of their prey, in preference to the viscera of the chest and abdomen. The muscle is, with respect to the generality of nations, the most habitual food, that which they are never tired of; it seems to be the most nourishing amongst all those borrowed from animal tissues. Does this, as is said, proceed from its containing a greater quantity of azote ? Whatever may be the rea- son, the important part which the muscular system takes in the act of digestion in all the carnivorous species, and particularly in man, is a very remarkable observation. All the parts of that system, however, do not appear equally pa- latable to animals. For instance, it is a very sin- gular observation, that the dead bodies brought to our dissecting-rooms, and upon which rats had begun to feed in our cemeteries, are almost ex- clusively gnawed in the muscles of the face. It may be observed, that in respect to this use of muscles in digestion, it is that part of the fibrous system adhering to the muscles, forming, as it were, a body with these organs :—I speak of tendons, that are sooner changed by maceration, ebullition, and most undoubtedly by the gastric fluids. It may also be remarked, that the consider- able mass formed by the muscles of the body in VOL. II, tjMUSCULA K SYSTEM 290 the animal creation supplies the voracious species with abundance of materials for their nutrition. Thus nature, by multiplying these organs in the individual they are intended to move, seems also to have held in view, the wants of other animals that are destined at some period to feed upon them. By forming them in each species, she has effectually provided for all. Who can tell if this general end, which observation displays in a great series of the animal creation, is not the cause of that remarkable predominance which the muscles display over every other system ? Who knows if nature would not have simplified the powers of animal mechanism, which are so very numerous and so considerably multiplied when compared with those of our artificial ma- chines ? Who can say that she would not have w simplified the means, and produced the same re- sults, if the motions to be performed by animals, had been her only object in forming the muscles ? The sex has considerable influence upon the quality of the flesh of animals. I do not believe that anything has yet been stated respecting the influence of the genital parts in this respect, but the following lines contain some remarkable facts. The muscles of the male, larger and more energetic, have a superior flavour, resist boiling much longer, are firmer, &c. Boiling water on the con- trary, affects those of the female much sooner; it is softer, and gives to the liquor a weaker flavour.291 OF ANIMAL LIFF. / During* rutting time, the muscular system of the former is penetrated with a peculiar smell, that often makes it disagreeable to the taste. This observation is easily verified in quadrupeds, birds, and even fishes, dressed for our meals. Without acquiring so strong a smell, the flesh of the latter is in similar instances flabby and taste- less. SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Muscular System of Animal Life. Cellular Tissue. The muscular tissue, is abundantly supplied with cellular tissue: I even know of no system, that in proportion, is so plentifully provided for. This tissue forms a very considerable layer, round every muscle; it is most generally loose, filled with fat, easily distended with air in emphysema, and with serum in anasarca: sometimes it is den- ser, tighter, and actually spread in the form of a membrance ; as that, for instance, which covers the obliquus externus deseenden, on which ac- count this part of dissection is rather difficult for the young student. The other muscles of the abdo- men, the trapezius, the serratus major, and the great dorsal are also similarly disposed. It might be thought that nature had intended this as a substitute for aponeuroses, that are wanting u 2292 M U SC IJ L A R * YST E M over the wide muscles of the trunk. This layer besides has nothing more than the appearance of membrane; it has not the same organization ; it disappears in infiltrations, in which cases every real membrane remains. Besides this general covering of the muscles, each skain is provided with a less, each fibre with a smaller still, each minute filament with hardly a perceptible sheath, although really existing. We might then represent to ourselves the cellular tissue of the muscles, as forming a continuation of sheaths successively decreasing. These co- verings accommodate the motions of the fibres, which they separate from each other, either by the serum of the cellulee, or by the fat they contain ; which two fluids by lubricating faci- litate their mutual motion. Frequently between these fibres the cellular tissue seems to form a kind of transverse lines, that divide them into rectangles. This disposition is particularly ob- served in the extensor proprius pollicis pedis, in the extensor communis, the fleshy bundles of which are wide and thin whenever they are dis- tended. In the greatest number of the thick muscles nothing of the kind is to be met with. The quantity of intermuscular cellular tissue varies very considerably. In general,in all the wide and long muscles, it is very abundant, it is pio- portionally less so, between the fibres of those of the vertebral furrows. Behind the neck, theOF ANIMAL LIFE. 293 spienius, the coinplexus, &care much more sparingly provided than many others, particularly in the spaces by which they are separated. Sometimes rather considerable cellular exten- sions are found amongst the muscles, and seem to divide them by halves ; sucliis that, which sepa- rates the clavicular portion of the pectoral is major : this even, has sometimes puzzled anato- mists, with regard to the division of these organs. In general the muscles are fixed in their re- spective positions by the cellular tissue ; the art of dissecting proves fhis fact. The collections of pus, frequently fulfil the office of the knife, and are also additional proofs of its use, an use which does not preclude motion in all directions, of which the excessive extensibility of the cellular tissue admits. The cellular tissue not only binds the muscles together, but also unites each of their fibres with those adjoining ; it is compressed during their contraction and lengthens when they are distended : if deprived of this tissue, their motions become inefficient and irregular. I have frequently by the knife separated a mus- cle laid bare in a living animal into several small skains ; and on causing subsequently this muscle to contract by irritating the marrow with an in- strument passed into the medullary cavity, I have remarked these irregular motions. If we divide, in a longitudinal direction, the muscle of a limb from its superior to the inferior tendon, into two orMUSCULAR SYSTEM 294 three isolated parts, then irritate one of these portions, the other, or the two others, will remain unmoved in almost every instance, whilst a single fibre being irritated in an uninjured muscle, will set the whole muscle in motion. The section of the vessels of the nerves, may undoubtedly have, some influence in producing this phenomenon, but certainly that of the cellular tissue also con- tributes to it. In dropsical subjects, the serum of the inter- muscular tissue has frequently a reddish appear- ance; this phenomenon is peculiar to the dead body, and proceeds from the serum having acted subsequent to death upon the colouring matter. I believe that this could not easily take place dur- ing life. Fat sometimes superabounds in this tissue, so far even that every fibre involved, as it were by it, is concealed, and this substance only remains apparent; but frequently also the yel- lowish aspect of the fibres is mistaken for an adipose state of the muscles, an aspect proceed- ing from the absence of the colouring matter. I have seldom ascertained the first state, the second very frequently ; one might easily be de- ceived by it at the first glance. By ebullition and combustion, it is easily ascertained that fat has nothing to do with the discolouration of the mus- cles examined in that state.295 OF ANIMAL LIFE. Vessels. The arteries of the muscles are excessively ap- parent ; they project from the adjoining'trunks, and penetrate the organ through every part of its circumference, but more towards the middle than the ends. At first they curl between the essen- tial bundles, then divide, and through these divi- sions proceed to the secondary skains, there they subdivide and twine amongst the fibres, are finally reduced into capillary tubes, and attend the most minute fibres, where they deposit, by means of the exhalant system, the nutritive sub- stance. Few organs, in proportion to their size, possess more blood than the muscles. This blood, as we shall see, is essentially requi- site to keep up excitement; by this fluid the muscular tissue is coloured, but not in the way that might, at first, be thought, by circulating in the tissue. The circulating or free part, hardly contributes to it; it is that part combined with the muscular tissue, that which contributes to its nutrition that gives the colour ; this will prove it: 1st. the fibres of the intestines contain as much, or even more of the circulating blood, than those of the muscles of animal life, and yet their tissue is most evidently whitish wherever these ve&sels are not met with. ‘Sndly. In several ani- mals only possessed of red and cold blood, par-MUSCULAR SYSTEM 296 ticulariy frogs, the muscles are nearly white, and yet a number of blood-vessels overrun this white tissue. 3rdly. I have observed, that in animals that have been strangulated, the colouring matter does not change its hue, and, undoubtedly, be- cause it is only gradually combined with the mus- cles in nutrition ; that on the contrary, if in such cases, a muscle be divided at the last moments of life, whilst the veinous fluid is still circulated through the arterial system, that blood will flow in black streams from the arteries of the muscles, and the tissue itself remain red. This curious ex- periment, which I have pointed out in another work, is made on strangulating an animal by compressing the trachea, or by any other means that may prevent the air from circulating through that tube, whilst the muscles are exa- mined. When a muscle has remained for some space of time exposed to the contact of air, es- pecially to that of oxygen, its reddish hue be- comes evidently brighter. In some instances, the vessels of the muscles suffer the blood they contained to escape, hence the different hemorrhages particularly remarkable in scorbutic subjects, and sometimes in putrid % fevers; seldom or never in such diseases as are characterized by an increase of vitality. Im- pregnated with blood in accidental hemorrhages, especially in the false aneurisms caused by effu- sion, the muscles are partly deprived of their mo-OF ANIMAL LIFE. 297 tion ; this is also the case in contusions, in which similar infiltrations are observed. In the muscles the veins constantly attend the arteries; distributed in the same manner, they borrow from the contractions of these organs an assistance essential to their action. The stream of blood is much greater when the patient, on bleeding, contracts his muscles, than when they ^remain relaxed. This motion is expressed in the same manner as water is forced from a sponge that has been wetted. This phenomenon is never observed in the arterial circulation. I have ob- served, that if we open the artery in the foot of an animal, and by irritating the nerves, cause the muscles of the leg and thigh, across which that artery passes to reach the bleeding part, and contract strongly, the stream of blood will remain the same as during a state of re- laxation. I have several times injected, with facility, the veins of the muscles of animal life, from the trunks towards the branches. This, notwithstand- ing what Haller has said, leads me to suppose, that in these organs as in the heart, the valves are not so numerous as in several others. The assistance which the veins borrow from the adja- cent organs, no doubt, forms a substitute to these folds, or rather renders them useless ; the weight of the column of blood producing no powerful effect on the parieties of the veins. We are well298 MUSCULAR SYSTEM, aware that varices are very seldom met with in the veins of muscles. These veins are of two kinds; some attend the arteries, and follow the same course; the others wind superficially over the surface of the organs, unattended with corre- sponding arteries. The muscles contain absorbants and exhalants. The first can be traced, though not without diffi- culty ; the second are inscrutable. Nerves. Almost all the nerves of the muscles of animal life proceed from the brain : the ganglions supply them with a few only, whenever this is the case, as in the neck, the pelvis, &c^ Resides the filaments proceeding from these nervous centres, 43o-rvi-e(%l filaments are constantly met with ; were it not for this, such organs would belong to the involuntary muscles. No organs whatever, in proportion to their size, are provided with more nerves than the muscles. In the extensors they do not appear to be quite so numerous as in the flexors: but the difference is very immaterial. It is true, that all the large nervous trunks are found in the direction of flexion ; that in that of exten- sion, branches and ramusculse only are to be met with, as is seen in the posterior part of the arm, of the fore-arm, of the spine, &c. This remark is also applicable to the existence of the vessels.OF ANIMAL LIFE; 299 which are much larger and more numerous in the former than in the latter direction ; but this in- crease in the number of vessels and nerves, pro- ceeds from there being many more flexors than extensors, from the former being stronger, and composed of more multiplied fibres; so that each of these fibres is not provided with more vascular and nervous filaments in one of these muscles than in the others. All that has been said re- specting the difference of strength between the fibres of the flexors and those of the extensors, respecting the predominance of the former over the latter, &c. I consider as without foundation. If there be any difference, it is because, as in the foot, the hand, &c. they are more numerous, or disposed to more advantage ; as round the trunk, upon which the abdominal muscles which bend the spine, are at a great distance from the point of resistance ; whilst, in what regards extension, the dorsal muscles perform their office immediately close to that point of resistance; such also as in the neck, wherein the muscles that depress the lower jaw and the head when that bone is fixed, are at a much greater distance from the occipital condyles than those which produce extension. Whatever may be the cause of this superiority of the flexors, it cannot be doubted, 1st. That in hysterical convulsions, in those of infancy, &c. in every spasmodic motion independent of the W]h, the contractions are more frequently pro-300 MUSCULAR SYSTEM duced in the direction of flexion than in that of extension, which, however, is sometimes the case ; 2dly. The flexors in the aged subject finally ob- tain a predominance over the extensors; the fingers and toes for instance are most generally bent; 3dly. In every motion the power is in the sense of flexion. - \ • On penetrating the muscles, the nerves make very acute angles with the extremities, because the nervous trunks follow the natural direction of these organs. In the trunk, on the contrary, those proceeding from the spine, particularly the cervicals, on penetrating their muscles, make almost right angles, or at least the angles are not very acute : this circumstance is immaterial: each branch, on reaching the fleshy fibres, first divides, then subdivides in the interstices, and is lost in their tissue. Is each individual fibre supplied with a ner- vous ramification? From the following observation one might be induced to believe it; namely, that on the principal branch being irritated, every fibre comes into play ; none are left in a state of inactivity; but, on the other hand, if one be ex- cited, they will all move, which undoubtedly is a sympathetic phenomenon, or proceeding from the cellular communications. Are the nerves, on entering the muscles, di- vested of their cellular sheaths ; do they become pulpous ? Dissection proves nothing of the kind.301 OF ANIMAL LIFE* ARTICLE III. \ Properties of the Muscular System of Animal Life. There are but few systems in the economy, in which the vital properties, and those of the tissue, are more energetic and striking than in Ihis. To convey a correct and precise idea of these pro- perties, the muscles should be selected. Their physical properties, on the contrary, are very obscure ; they are characterized by a remarkable softness, and a want of elastic power in their tis- sue. They have scarcely any resistance whatever after death, and it is only during life they borrow that degree of energy by which they are charac- terized. SECTION i. Properties of the Tissue, Extensibility. Extensibility in the muscular system of ani- mal life is developed in numerous instances. The different motions of the body display this property in its strongest light. Such is in fact the state of the muscular system, that one of its parts cannot be contracted without the other being distended. The flexion of the thigh necessarily causes an elon- gation of the semi-nervous, the semi-tendinous, and the biceps muscles. By stretching the armMUSCULAR SYSTEM 302 outwards the pectoralis-major is extended ; when lifted it extends the latissimus dorsi and rhomboi- deus-major. Every considerable flexion obviously extends the antagonist muscles, and vice versa. Whenever a muscle is extended by its antagonist, that organ is left completely passive ; it is mo- mentarily deserted, as it were, by its contracti- lity, or rather still possessed of it, this property is less active ; it merely obeys the motion that is communicated to it. In these cases the disten- sion exclusively bears upon the fleshy part, the tendon has nothing to do with it: whatever may be the distance between the points of insertion, whether they are removed farther from each other, or drawn nearer together, during the diffe- rent degrees of extension, it remains the same; the longer the muscle the more easily it is ex- tended. The sartorius, the posterior muscles of the thigh, &c. obviously display this phenomenon : thus is their position perfectly accommodated to it. In general, all the muscles remarkable for their extent are superficial, and most commonly traverse one or two articulations; sometimes even three or four, as in the limbs. Now the number of these articulations readily admits of very considerable variations in the space included between the two points of insertion, variations to which the great extensibility of these muscles are adapted. From what has been above stated it will be easily conceived, that it is the length of theOF ANIMAL LIFE. 303 fleshy fibre, and not the combined length of the muscle to which its extensibility relates. Those with which many aponeuroses are intermixed, that partly borrow their extent from these mem- branes, or from the tendons, do not so fully en- joy this property. Hence, in the very same mo- tions, mi s lies of the same length contract or elongate their fleshy parts to a greater or less de- gree. Let it be observed, however, that when the tendinous portion predominates very consi- derably, or that, on the other hand, it appears to be very thin, it also yields a little, as we see in- stances of in the plantaris, in the palmaris, &c. When from the natural we proceed to the pathological state, we find muscular extensibility displayed in a still more striking degree in the face ; air accumulated in the mouth, swells it by lengthening the buccinators ; the various tumours of this cavity, the funguses, the sarcomas, fre- quently distend the small facial muscles, in a man- ner that would strike us, if in the production of this phenomenon, we only allowed for the small extent of these muscles, which, in such cases are extended three or even four-fold. The muscles of the eyelids, of the eye, in the carcinoma of that organ, those of the anterior parts of the neck, in large swellings in the thyroid gland, the great pectoral muscle in extensive aneurisms or other tumours of the armpit, the abdominal muscles304 MUSCULAR SYSTEM daring’ pregnancy, or dropsy, or in various tumours of the abdomen, and the superficial and wide muscles of the hack, in certain cases of swellings situate beneath, display these phenomena of dis- tention in the most obvious light. The muscles of the limbs are not so liable to them, because the causes that produce tumours are not so numerous, and the aponeuroses would not so readily admit of such phenomena. Contractility o f the Tissue. In muscles, this contractility is carried to its utmost extent. These organs have a permanent tendency to contraction, particularly when by lengthening they have exceeded their natural dimensions. This tendency is independent of the action of the nerves, as well as the irritable pro- perty of the muscular tissue. It may be influenced by vitality, but is not especially connected with it, as it depends upon the structure of the muscles. The remarkable phenomenon of the antagonist muscles results from it. Such is this phenome- non. Every moveable point in the animal frame is constantly situate between two muscular powers, opposed to each other ; between those of flexion and extension, of elevation and depression, of ad- duction and abduction, of rotation without, andOF ANIMAL LIFE. 305 rotation within, &c. This opposition is a con- dition essential to motion; for in whatever direc- tion the limb be moved, the moveable point must necessarily be in the opposed motion ; the act of flexion requires it should be primitively extended, and vice versa. The two reverse positions as- sumed by a moveable part, are alternate in re- spect to that part; the points at .which motion begins and terminates, and the two extreme dis- tances of these positions, are the limits between which it is allowed to move. Now, between these two limits there is a medium point, it is that of rest of the moveable part, and in this position the muscles are in their natural state ; on deviating from it some are extended, whilst others are con- \ traded ; and they are so disposed, that the contrac- tions and extensions that are performed in reverse directions, are in exact proportion. Hence in the reciprocal influence the muscles possess over each other, these organs are alternately active and passive, an acting or a resisting power, organs moved, or moving organs. The effect then of every muscle that contracts, is not only to act upon the bone into which it is implanted, but also on the opposite muscle ; frequently even be- tween two antagonist muscles no solid organ is interposed, as in the lips, over the linea alba, &c. In this case the muscle of one side acts directly upon the one opposite, and distends it. Now this action of one muscle over the other, precisely VOL. II. xMUSCULAR SYSTEM 306 constitutes the phenomenon of the antagonist muscles; two muscles are such, that the one cannot be extended without the other con- tracting, and reciprocally. Let us examine what share the contractility of the tissue has in this phenomenon; its influence should be properly distinguished from that of the vital powers, an influence that has hitherto been completely over- looked. Whenever a muscle rests in its medium po- sition, it cannot possibly be removed from it, but by the influence of the vital powers, by that of animal contractility, or of sensible organic con- tractility, because in this position the contracti- lity of tissue of its antagonist is in equilibrium with its own, and an additional force is therefore required to overpower the opposing one. If this muscle, however, should be placed in one of the extremes of the preceding positions; for in- stance, in adduction, abduction, flexion, exten- sion, &c. then there will be inequality of action between the antagonists in regard to the con- tractility of tissue; that which is extended the most will make a greater effort to contract than that which is already contracted. To main- tain an equilibrium, it is then requisite the vital powers should continue to influence the con- tracted muscles. Thus every extreme position of the limbs, and of any moveable part, can only be continued in the natural state, by means of theOF ANIMAL LIFE. 307 vital powers. Let these powers cease to act, and instantly the contractility of the extended muscle will actually come in play, and restore the moveable part to its medium position, a po- sition in which the equilibrium is restored. This explains why, in every case in which the cerebral influence does not act upon the muscles in which they are not irritated by stimulants, the limbs are always in a medium position with respect to flexion and extension, adduction, abduction, Sic. This is the case, during sleep, with the foetus, &c. I have demonstrated elsewhere how the disposition of the bones in each articulation is accommodated to this phenomenon, how every other kind of connection between the articulating surfaces, besides that of this medium position, pre- sented a forced state, in which some ligaments are unavoidably more drawn out than others, and in which the surfaces are never in such per- fect contact as in this position. In certain fevers which exercise a deleterious influence over the vitality and texture of muscles, the horizontal position, and the extension of the limbs, do not proceed from an increase of action in the exten- sors, but from a want of energy in the flexors which cannot counterbalance the weight of the limb. Thus every analogous attitude always co- incides with signs of general weakness ; it is that of putrid fevers, &c. The section of a living muscle displays two x 2308 MUSCULAR SYSTEM phenomena that evidently result from the con- tractility of tissue. 1st. The two divided ends contract in two op- posite directions, leaving between them a space proportionate to the retraction. This retraction ]s not regulated, as it was conceived, by the de- grees of muscular contraction; if this were the case, it would be sufficient, in cases of a transverse wound, to place the limb in the most relaxed state, in order to bring the divided parts in con- tact ; for frequently, in this case, they remain se- parated, but the retraction frequently exceeds the utmost contraction of the muscle considered in its natural state. 2dly. The antagonist of the divided muscle having no longer any effort to overcome, contracts and withdraws the moveable part, if no other mus- cles, acting in the direction of the former, supply the deficiency. This last phenomenon also takes place to a certain degree when paralysis affects the face. The mouth is then drawn towards the sound side. I have remarked, however, in this respect, that this deviation is never so striking as it would be in the division of a paralysed mus- cle which has retained its contractility of tissue. The remaining contractility, during the absence of motion, maintains in part an equilibrium with that of the muscles of the sound side. Thus the deviation becomes very striking only when the patients attempt to speak, for when the sound309 OF ANIMAL LIFF. muscles are excited, the others cannot counterba- lance the action. A paralysis of the sterno-mas- toideus displays, in respect to the whole head, a phenomenon similar to that produced by the pre- ceding instance with regard to the mouth, Stra- bism frequently proceeds from this cause. In general, in all these phenomena, it is neces- sary to consider what belongs to the vital powers, and what proceeds from the contractility of the tissue. The muscles are antagonists in respect to these powers, as in respect to their j contractility ; but as the contraction which depends upon the nervous influence, or from irritability, is much better characterized than that of the organic tis- sue, the phenomena in the antagonist muscles are much more striking in paralysis when the sound muscles are brought to act in the former manner. It appears that in numerous cases of paralysis, the contractility of tissue on the diseased side is also rather effected, but is never so completely destroyed as to leave, in the amputation of a pa- ralysed limb, no power of muscular re-action. I have tried this experiment upon a dog ten days after, the nerves having been cut, during which interval the limb had remained completely mo- tionless. The section of the muscles produced an evident vacancy between the two divided ends ; and I also found no difference when, subsequently, and for the sake of comparison, I amputated the other limb.310 MUSCULAR SYSTEM It is particularly when the muscles have been previously distended, and the cause of distention is removed, that the contractility of the tissue be- comes evident. The operation for ascites and delivery in respect to the abdominal muscles, the opening' of deep collections for those of the trunk, the extirpation of any tumour, &c. display this property in action, in the most obvious light. In this respect, however, it ought to be remarked, that if the extension has been rather long conti- nued, or too frequently repeated, the consequent contraction will be less, because the muscular i tissue has been weakened by the painful state in which it has been kept: hence, 1st. The flaccidity of the abdomen resulting from repeated preg- nancies ; 2dly. The laxity of the scrotum subse- quent to the puncture of an old hydrocele; 3dly, I have seen at M. Desault’s, a man from whom a fungus in the mouth had been removed in Germany, and who on that side of the face where the disease had existed, had very large wrinkles, owing to a greater extent of the fleshy layer on that part which could no longer contract like the other, mastication at that time being performed on the sound side only; 4thy. When- ever women have borne many children, the dia- phragm is weakened by repeated pressures ; hence partly proceeds the greater mobility of the sides, that in females compensates for a deficiency of the action in this muscle. 1 am induced to think.OF ANIMAL LIFE. 311 that in various chronic affections of the chest, and of the abdomen, attended with long conti- nued distention of this muscle, physicians should pay more attention to this cause of difficulty in the act of respiration, when the principle for dis- tention has been removed, as subsequent to the evacuation of the fluid in dropsical subjects, &c. In muscles, the extent of the contractility of the tissue is proportionate with the length of the fibres. This explains why, in amputations, the superficial layer retracts more than the deep one ; why, during sleep, the phenomena of contracti- lity of tissue are very apparent in the limbs that are provided with very long muscles; why, in the antagonist muscles, nature has in general op- posed to each other muscles of corresponding power; why, consequently, a muscle with long fibres is seldom opposed to one formed of short ones, and vice versa. The flexors, the extensors, of the arm, of the fore-arm, of the thigh, of the leg, are nearly all of the same length ; those which rotate the humerus inwardly, and those which move it in the contrary direction, the former arising from the infra-spinal cavity, the latter from the inner surface of the scapula, re- semble each other in this respect. The proportion between the antagonist muscles is still more re- markable in the facb, wherein the same muscles most commonly act in quite opposite ways to each other, on each side of the medium line.MUSCULAR SYSTEM 312 The rapidity of contractions, arising from the contractility of the tissue, is not like those pro- duced by animal contractility, or by sensible organic contractility, which are always more or less striking, accordingly as the nervous influence or the stimulant has acted more or less power- fully. Every motion depending upon the con- tractility of the tissue is slow, uniform, and re- gular in its progress; it decreases only when the muscular tissue is weakened, and increases with the power of the latter: from whence it follows, that these varieties in rapidity can only be ob- served in two different individuals, or in the same individual, but at different times, and not as in the exercise of the vital powers, from one moment to the other. This is an important and remark- able distinction between these two species of pro- perties. Death weakens the contractility of the tissue, but does not completely annihilate it: a muscle being divided, retracts long after life has forsaken it. Putrefaction only can destroy this property, and this is also the case with respect to extensi- bility, I have observed, however, that as long as the muscles retain their natural heat, they pos- sess greater power of retraction, than when they have become cold from death. Haller placed on the same line, and deduced from the same principles, the phenomena result- ing from the contractility of the tissue, which,OF ANIMAL LIFE. 3] 3 admitting of a few distinctions only, answer to its dead power, and those produced by alcohol fire, concentrated acids, &c. on animal sub- stances, which shrink and contract by the effects of these different agents : but the following dif- ferences will essentially distinguish these pheno- mena. 1st. The contractility of the tissue is not very weak in organs evidently endowed with very great powers of contraction ; for instance, in every organ belonging to the fibrous, fibro- cartilaginous, serous systems, &c. &c. 2ndly. The contractility of the tissue is distributed throughout the body in very variable proportions : from the muscles and the skin, that possess this faculty in the highest degree, to cartilages which do not seem to possess it, there are innumer- able variations; the faculty of hardening under the effects of the above-mentioned agents on the contrary, is uniformly bestowed, or at least its differences are much less striking. 3rdly. The one is destroyed in organs that have been dried, the other is retained for a long series of years : parchment is a proof of it. 4thly. The former evidently receives, particularly in muscles, addi- tional energy from life ; the latter hardly seems modified by it. 5thly. This is invariably at- tended with sudden effects, with rapid contrac- tion. To feel the contact of fire, of concen- trated acids and alcohol, and to contract, are, in regard to animal parts, phenomena that occur atMUSCULAR SYSTEM 314 the same moment. The contractility of the tis- sue, on the contrary, is but slowly produced. 6thly. This is not calculated to give to the parts, especially to muscles, that remarkable degree of density displayed during their contractions. 7thly. A deficiency of extension in the fibres is the only unavoidable condition required for the exercising of the contractility of tissue, which is incessantly disposed to act; to cause a fibre to contract, on the contrary, necessarily requires the contact of a mechanical agent. To these proofs, I could add many more, to establish a distinction between the phenomena, which have been con- founded together by the illustrious Helvetian physiologist. SECTION II. Vital Properties. \ ' 1 The greatest number of these properties, take a very important part in the muscles ; we shall first examine those of animal life, after which those of organic life will be considered. Properties of Animal Lfe.—Sensibility. Animal sensibility in these organs is of all vital properties, the most obscure, at least, when they are investigated in the natural state. Divided transversely in amputation, and in experiments315 OF ANIMAL LIFE- performed on living animals, they cause no re- markably painful sensation : pain is severely felt, only when a nervous filament is divided by the incision- The proper tissue of the muscles is hardly possessed of any sensibility, nor is this property better displayed by the application of any chemical stimulant whatever. There is, however, in muscles a peculiar sen- sation, which most evidently belongs to this pro- perty ; it is that experienced subsequent to re- peated contractions, and termed weariness. After a long continued position, this sensation is par- ticularly felt in the thick fasciculi of the lum- bar-muscles. Subsequent to progression, running, &c. if performed on a horizontal plane, all the muscles of the inferior limbs are affected; if on an ascending plane, it is the flexors of the ilio- femoral articulation, and in the contrary case, the same sensation is felt in the posterior mus- cles of the trunk. In such trades as especially require the exertion of the upper extremities, this sensation is frequently experienced in a very remarkable manner, and which, most undoubt- edly, is not owing to the compression of the con- tracted muscles upon the small nerves, with which they are supplied. In fact, it may be experienced without this antecedent contraction, as is ob- served during the commencement of numerous diseases, wherein it generally extends over the whole muscular system, the patient complaining316 muscuj.au system of that fatigue and weariness that attends ex- cessive pedestrian exertion. This sensation seems to depend upon the peculiar mode of animal sen- sibility in muscles, a sensibility which other agents are not calculated to produce, and which in this case, the permanence of contraction ren- ders very striking. In the same manner the fibrous system, sensible only to the distentions that act upon it, gives no pain when under the influence of other irritating agents. It should also be remarked, that this painful sensation produced in the muscles by too long continued a motion, is a means nature has selected £o warn the animal it is time to put an end to past, to avoid conse- quences that might prove fatal. Hence is the peculiar sensation arising from the distention of ligaments, intended to inform the animal to cease the distention ; hence each organ being pos- sessed of its peculiar mode of sensibility, what an incorrect idea would be conceived of the existence of this property, if mechanical and chemical agents only were selected to convey that idea. Nature has particularly accom- modated the peculiar mode of animal sensibility bestowed upon every organ, to the various uses for which that organ is intended. In phlegmasiae of the proper muscular tissue, animal sensibility is frequently exalted to the utmost degree ; the slightest contact on the skin proves very painful; the patient can hardly bearOF ANIMAL LI Ft. 31*. the weight of the clothes ; the least commotioi given to the bed will often cause excessive pain in all the limbs ; but in general, these kind of pains are very different from that sensation termed weariness: thus the pain felt by the distention of a ligament in its natural state, is not similar to that arising from a ligament or any other organ when inflamed. To what has already been stated respecting this sensation I shall add, that some organs, in the same manner as the muscles, are wearied by too long a continuance of their functions; such are the eyes by the contact of light, the ears by the impression of sounds, the brain by long medita- tions, &c., and, generally speaking, every organ belonging to animal life : and the want of sleep even, is, as I have proved it in my researches upon life, an effect of this general weariness. Yet it should be remarked, that the sensation caused by the eye, the ear, the brain, and by every ex- ternal organ, thus wearied, is not -the same as that of the muscles that have been over-exerted ; a further instance of the peculiar mode of sensi- bility in the latter, and in general of every animated part. Animal Contractility. This animal property, on which revolve all the phenomena of locomotion and voice, that also promotes many of those of the interior and exteriorMUSCULAR SYSTEM 318 functions, is exclusively seated in the muscular system of animal life: it is this that distinguishes it from the organic, and even from any other. It consists in the faculty of moving under cerebral influence, whether this influence be determined by the will or by other causes. Animal contrac- tility then, as well as the sensibility of the same denomination, bears a peculiar character distinct from the two organic contractilities, a character that consists in its action, and not concentrated in the moving organ, but requires also the interfer- ence of the brain and nerves. The brain is the principal from which this property flows, the centra] point to which every sensation is referred. The cerebral nerves are the agents of transmission, in the same manner as they are, though in a re- verse sense, the conveyers of the phenomena of sensation ; hence it follows, that to form a cor- rect idea of this property, it should be studied in the brain, in the nerves, and in the muscle itself. Animal Contractility considered in the Brain. Every thing in the phenomena of animal con- tractility proclaims the influence of the brain. In the natural state, if rather more blood be conveyed to that organ, as during passion; if opium taken in a moderate dose, causes gentle excita- tion ; if wine produce the same effect, the mus-OF ANIMAL LIFE- 319 cular action will increase in energy in proportion as that of the brain is increased. If terror, by weakening the powers of the heart, and on that account the quantity of blood conveyed to the brain destroys its power; if the dif- ferent narcotics, carried to an excess, produce a similar effect; if wine obstructs its action when used in an immoderate quantity, then the muscles are seen languid in their motions, and experience even a remarkable intermission. If the brain be completely concentrated in its connections with our senses, or in its intellectual functions, its in- fluence is diverted from the muscles, and these organs are left inactive :—he whose attention is completely captivated in looking or listening at- tentively, does not move ; and in contemplation, reflection, or meditation, he is similarly influenced. The phenomena of ecstasies, the history of the studies of our philosophers, frequently present this important fact, this muscular relaxation, the principle of which rests in a revulsion of the cerebral influence, that is increased in other func- tions to the detriment of locomotion. All causes which in diseases powerfully act upon the brain, spontaneously re-act upon the muscular system of animal life, and this re-action is obvious in two reverse states, in paralysis and spasm. The first state indicates a loss of energy, the second an increase; the one is produced in compressions caused by pus, by effusions of blood,MUSCULAR SYSTEM 32 0 by bones forced from their natural position, by apoplexy ; it generally occurs in sudden attacks of hemiphlegia, in which the patient falls down and is senseless, giving every sign of a cerebral affection. This ceases but its effects do not, and these effects produce a loss of power in one divi- sion of the muscular system. The other, or the convulsive state, proceeds from the different irri- tations of the cerebral organ, owing to splinters of bone that have entered its substance, inflam- mation of its substance, or that of its membranes, to the various tumours that may form within, to organic injuries, injuries I have seldom seen in the adult, but sometimes in infancy, and to the very causes of compressions ; for this convulsive state is frequently found to coincide with different effusions, with hydrocephalus, &c. The state of the muscular system of animal life is a thermometer with regard to that of the brain, the degree of its motions indicating the energy in this organ. Physicians who attend hospitals for lunatics, have frequently occasion to consult this thermometer. Next to a furious maniac, in whom the muscular power is doubled or even trebled, is a man whose motions are cha- racterized by a remarkable apathy. A multipli- » city of degrees are observed in these motions, and these degrees do not depend upon the mus- cles only; the former is frequently that in whom external forms indicate the weakest muscularOF ANIMAL LIFE. 321 construction, as the latter often displays a strong muscular appearance. Muscles are to the brain what arteries are to the heart. By these vessels the physician is informed of the state of the central organ from which they receive the impulse ; by the muscles of animal life, he ascertains also that of the central organ of that life. Observe the patients in a number of violent fevers, we shall find prostration in the morning, in the evening excessive agitation in the muscles. Now where is the seat of this revolution ? Not in the muscles, but in the brain. If on leaving the patient’s bed-side we enter the physiologist’s laboratory, we find his experi- ments perfectly coincide with the preceding ob- servations. Fy tying all the arteries that resort to the brain, vve suddenly interrupt the motions of that organ, motions indispensable to its action ; and abruptly put an end to voluntary motion and subsequently to life. By injecting through the ca- rotid and towards the head, with solutions of neutral salts, of acids, the contacts of which sub- stances are fatal to the cerebral action, I have constantly seen the animal’s death preceded by convulsive motions. The injection of water does not produce a similar effect. This fluid may, in respect to the life of the brain, be introduced with impunity into the arterial circulation if moderately injected ; but on being conveyed with VOL. II. VMUSCULAR SYSTEM 322 force, this organ is strongly irritated, and the animal is instantly seized with violent agitations; lessen the impulse and it becomes quiet. I have mentioned this experiment before. If the brain be laid bare, and irritated with a mechanical or chemical agent, <&c. the muscular system of ani- mal life is immediately excited. In these expe- riments, however, it should be noticed that the convexity of the organ appears to have less con- nection with the motions than its basis. Limited to the cortical, and to the superficial layers of the medullary substance, the irritation is very trifling, it is only on reaching the inferior layers that convulsions ensue. I have repeatedly at- tempted to determine the exact point where the irritation begins to cause convulsions, but this has constantly been attended with much diffi- culty, and the results have varied in an astonish- ing degree. I am led to believe that general con- clusions only can be established, namely, that in experiments, the nearer we approach the tuber annulare, and, generally speaking, the cerebral basis, the stronger will be the convulsions ; they have no relation with the cojivex surface. Let it be remarked, it is in the part of their basis, that is to say, in their most essential part, the brain receives the innumerable vessels that convey to it both excitation and life, either by the motion they communicate, or by the nature of the red blood323 OF ANIMAL life. they circulate, as the experiments I lately pub- lished have, I conceive, sufficiently demonstrated. To these experiments let us add those of arti- ficial concussion. The muscles of the ox quiver, and refuse any further support the moment it re- ceives the blow. Animals under the stroke that meets the occiput, expire with convulsive mo- tions. In the limbs, rabbits frequently display this phenomenon. Pigeons die with a convulsive qui- vering of their wings. Irregular agitation pro- duced by an irregular distribution of the cerebral influence of the brain, always immediately pre- cede death resulting from the injury. From all these experiments, and from the pre- ceding observations, we may conclude that the action of the muscular system of animal life is constantly allied to the state of the brain, that whenever this action is increased or lessened, there is almost always an increase or diminution of the cerebral powers. Let us not exaggerate, however, the connec- tions between the cerebral phenomena and those of the muscles, for observation might contradict us. There are indeed various instances of serous, sanguineous, and even purulent collections, form- ing in the brain, without the muscular motion having been impaired. Different tumours and cases of mal-conformation have produced dis- turbance in the intellectual functions, without the muscles having participated in the injury. How y 2324 muscular system frequently the brain is affected in various kinds of mental alienations; how often do the intelli- gence, memory, attention, imagination, proclaim these affections by their irregular aberrations, without the muscular system having participated. Are not exterior sensations very often altered without the motion being so? The brain is in general intended for three important functions; 1st. It receives the impressions of the external senses, and is in this respect the focus of percep- tion ; 2dly. It is the principle, the centre of vo- luntary motion, which cannot take place without its influence ; Sdly. The intellectual phenomena are essentially connected with the regularity of the life of this viscus,—it is the seat of them as it were. Now one of its functions only may be deranged, and the others remain perfect; it may be a regular principle for motions, and an irre- gular centre for the intellectual phenomena ; it may be deprived of communications through the organs of sensation with outward forms, and yet produce motions, or preside over the intellectual functions, as when our sleep is disturbed by dreams, &c. From what has been stated, it follows that a foetus wholly void of brain, cannot possibly continue to live on leaving the parent’s womb. As animal life does not exist in the foetus, respiration cannot take place, and as the functions are restricted to general circulation, to secretions, to exhalation.OF ANIMAL LIFE. 325 and nutrition, such subjects may be possessed of life in the mother's womb, and even very evi- dently admit in this state of an increase in di- mension ; but at birth, the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm being unable to act, respiration can- not be carried on, the gastric viscera receive no in- fluence from their muscular parieties, and the limbs are in a complete state of immobility : animal life which at the instant of birth has begun for other parts, cannot commence in them, because they are denied the centre of this life ; they are possessed of senses, but having nothing to receive the im- pression of muscles, nothing to put them in mo- tion, they can only continue to live a short time within themselves, without relation to external objects. But as in general it seems, that the in- stant the child leaves the womb the red blood becomes indispensable to him ; that to obtain this blood he must breathe; and this function being deficient, he loses the interior life with which he was animated in the mother’s womb. There are acephali, in which a small medullary swelling is observed at the origin of the nerves ; in others the spinal marrow is more voluminous. If these medullary swellings, if this spinal marrow7, act in virtue of their peculiar textures as substitutes for the brain, life might take place, and in this manner only the instances produced of acephali, who had lived a short time, might be accounted for ♦, but most undoubtedly, an acephalous subject326 MUSCULAR SYSTEM organized as we are, in whom there is no substi- tute for the brain, is not calculated to live. Thus in nearly every instance of this monstrosity quoted by authors, by Haller in particular, these subjects have died immediately after birth. Animal Contractility considered in the Nerves. Distant from almost every muscle, the brain communicates with and transmits its influence by means of the nervous system. Now these com- munications are effected in two different ways; 1st. There are nerves that proceed immediately from the brain to the muscles of animal life; 2dly. The greatest part do not proceed from the organ itself, but from the spinal marrow. Almost all the muscles of the neck, all those of the chest, of the abdomen, of the limbs, borrow their nerves from the latter source ; the spinal marrow, is as it were a general nerve, of which the others are the principal branches and divisions. All injuries sustained by this essential nerve, are felt by the muscles that are under its influ- ence ; the compressions it is exposed to by frac- tures of the vertebrae, by any displacement what- ever ; by an effusion of blood, of serum, of pus, &c. in the vertebral canal; the commotions re- sulting from a violent blow on the region of the spine, by a fall on the loins, or on the superior part of the sacrum, are attended with numbness327 OF ANIMAL LIFE. \ and paralysis of the subjacent muscles. Let the spinal marrow be divided by introducing the knife in its canal, and all motion below the division will immediately cease. If it be our object to produce convulsions, let an instrument be passed into the canal, let the marrow be excited either with that instrument, or with different chemical agents conveyed through its means, every part of the muscular system of animal life situate below, will instantly quiver and be convulsed. The higher the injury sustained by the marrow, the greater the danger; its influence in the lum- bar region bears upon the inferior extremities and the muscles of the pelvis only ; in the back it is followed by paralysis both of these muscles and of those of the abdomen. Now as these con- tribute indirectly to respiration, this function begins to be obstructed ; if the injury be above the dorsal region, respiration will be still more diffi- cult, because the intercostal muscles have lost their powers; the diaphragm alone maintains the action, because the diaphragmatic nerve still re- ceives and transmits the cerebral influence. If the injury happen to be above the origin of this nerve, there is an end to the action of the dia- phragm, to the contraction of the intercostal, and to that of the abdominal muscles; respiration ceases, and circulation is therefore interrupted j the blood being no longer conveyed to the brain, the action of this organ is annihilated. This ex-MUSCULAR SYSTEM 328 plains why the luxations of the first vertebrae over the second are attended with sudden death, whenever the displacement is very considerable; why experienced practitioners will not some- times run the chance of reduction when they are incomplete, for fear of completing them, and destroying the patient they wish to save ; why again, on knocking clown an animal, the blow is constantly directed to the upper and back part of the spine ; why a knife thrust between the first and second vertebrae causes instant death, &c. The successive influence of the different parts of the spinal marrow over the muscles and gene- ral life, will be perfectly elucidated by passing a long wire into the inferior part of the vertebral canal of any animal, of a guinea pig for instance, and by extending it up to the cranium through the spinal marrow, which is lacerated by it. In proportion as the wire ascends, convulsions in the inferior limbs are first observed, then in the abdominal muscles, afterwards respiration is dis- turbed, then it ceases, and finally death is the result. From all these facts, the influence of the spinal marrow upon motion, the principal of which it receives from the brain, and subsequently trans- mits to the nerves, cannot, I think, be doubted. These transmit to the muscle that principal they have received, either through the intervention of the marrow', as in almost all those of the trunk,329 OF ANIMAL LIFE. and the limbs, or directly from the brain, as in those of the face, of the tongue, of the eyes, &c. There are other proofs of this influence ; the tying, the division, or the compression of a nerve will paralyze the corresponding muscle. If a nerve, laid bare in an animal, be irritated by any means, spasmodic contractions are instantly produced in the muscles. These experiments have been so repeatedly and correctly made by many authors, that I think it useless to dwell upon them any longer; they are met with in every book. Irritation continued for some time on one part of the nerve, will exhaust its influence upon the muscle, this remaining unmoved ; but it is again excited if the irritation be applied to a lower part of the nerve. If this be tyed, the motion ceases when the irritation is above the ligature, but is renewed when the ligature is re- moved or irritation is produced below it. I have remarked that all the nerves of animal life do not appear equally calculated to transmit to the muscles the different irradiations of the brain. In fact, whilst in diseases, in wounds on the head, in our experii ents, &c., the muscles of the limbs are convulsed or paralysed with the utmost facility, those of the abdomen, of the neck, and more particularly those of the chest, only display these phenomena, when the causes of excitement or depression are carried to theMUSCULAR SYSTEM 330 utmost extent. Nothing is more common than to see the abdomen and the chest in their natural degree of muscular contraction, whilst the limbs or the face are distorted with convulsive motions. In most cases of hemiphlegia the mouth is distorted; the upper and lower extremities on one side are motionless, and yet the pectoral and abdominal muscles continue to act: the muscles of the larynx are much sooner affected with paralysis than these; hence the different alterations to which the voice is liable. A proportionate scale for the susceptibility of muscles for receiving the cerebral influence, or of the nerves for propa- gating it, would not be difficult to form, for it cannot be easily determined to which of these two phenomena the cause is owing. At the top of this scale might be placed the muscles of the limbs, then, in succession, those of the face, of the larynx, those of the abdomen find pelvis, and finally the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm : the latter are, of all the muscles, the least suscepti- ble of being paralyzed. Let us observe how very properly this scale would be accommodated to that of the functions ; what would become of life, intimately connected with the perfect state of respiration, if every cerebral injury were as readily transmitted to the diaphragm, and to the intercostal muscles, as to those of the limbs? Paralysis of the latter deprives the animal of oneOF ANIMAL LIFE. 331 means only of communicating with external ob- jects, but paralysis of the others, instantly de- stroys both external and internal life. The nervous influence is always propagated from above downwards, and never in the reverse sense. If a nerve be divided in two parts, and the lower part be irritated, the subjacent mus- cles contract; but, however much the other is excited, it will never produce the least con- traction in the muscles situate above ; in the same manner the spinal marrow on being transversely divided, and excited both above and below, the effects are only observable in the last: in respect to motion, the nervous influence is never found to ascend as in respect to sensation. Animal Contractility considered in the Muscles. The muscles especially intended to receive the cerebral influence through the medium of nerve, take also an active part in their own contraction. To exercise this property, to answer to the cere- bral excitement, they should be entire. When- ever their tissue is affected by any injury what- ever, or this tissue is no longer in its natural state, the muscle either remains motionless, or moves with irregularity, although it receives a regular supply of nervous influence. The fol- lowing are divers circumstances that relate to the muscle itself, and prevent or alter its contractions.MUSCULAR SYSTEM 33*2 1st. An inflamed muscle does not contract; the blood which penetrates its fibres, and the increase of its organic powers, prevent it from answering to the excitement. In quinsy, the deglutition is impeded as much by the want of power in the muscle, as by the in- flammation of the mucous membrane. It is ob- vious, that the inflammation of the bladder causes a retention of urine, and that of the diaphragm, throws the effects of respiration almost wholly upon the intercostal muscles. 2ndly. Every thing that tends to weaken, to relax the muscular tissue, as external blows, bruises, contusions, infiltrations of serum in the extremities, or long continued distention caused by a subjacent tumour, will alter, disorganize, and even annihilate animal contractility. 3rdly. Whenever the blood ceases to flow to the muscles, these organs are incapable of mo- tion. Stenon has observed, and I have always re- marked it myself, that by tying the aorta above its separation into the common iliacs, paralysis of the lower extremities is instantly produced. It is sufficiently known that in the operation of aneu- rism, a numbness, more or less considerable, con- stantly attends the application of the ligature. This state is continued until the collateral branches act as substitutes to the artery, which no longer con- veys any fluid. The motion produced in the muscle by the contact of blood, is then an essen-333 OF ANIMAL LIFE. tial condition of muscular contraction ; thus, the habitual motion imparted to every other organ, and especially to the brain, maintains both motion and life. 4thly. To obey cerebral influence, it is not only requisite that the muscle should receive the im- petus of the blood, but also of the red or ar- terial blood. The dark blood is not calculated to maintain motion by its contact. General weakness, the fall of the animal, are the first symptoms of asphyxia, in which the dark blood invades every part. I shall not repeat here the proofs of this assertion, sufficiently explained, I believe, in my researches on the different species of death, but in this respect I shall refer to that book. 5thly. A fluid different from blood, water, oily albuminous fluids, <&c. and still more urine, sour and irritating fluids, solutions of acids, of alkalies, &c. are not calculated to maintain muscular ac- tion; on the contrary, they will paralyze it: injected through the crural arteries in a living animal, when the circulation of the blood has been stopped above by a ligature, they weaken and even anni- hilate motion, as I have frequently been con- vinced. The results in these experiments vary according to the fluid that has been used ; the motions cease after a greater or less interval; they are weakened or totally suspended ; but is there al- ways a striking difference from the natural state ?MUSCULAR SYSTEM 334 Will the contact of the different gases with the muscles modify their contractions? Since my publication on membranes I have tried no expe- riments on this head. Those contained in that work give the following results:—The frogs and gui- nea-pigs made emphysematous by forcing into the sub-cutaneous tissue air, which subsequently in- vades the cellular interstices, and comes every where in contact with the muscular system, move nearly as usual. If oxygen be selected for the experiment, the motions of the inflated animal are not accelerated, they are not lessened if inflated with carbonic gas, with hydrogen, &c. Every inflation I have attempted on each individual of the two species already mentioned, of animals provided with red and cold blood, and of those with red and warm, to obtain an exam- ple of each, have in general perfectly succeeded; the animals apparently experienced no essential inconvenience from it, and it gradually disap- peared. Emphysema produced by nitrous gas is always fatal, the contact of the fluid seems to pa- ralyze the muscles almost immediately. 7thly. If instead of inflating the cellular tissue of a living animal with gas, other fluid substances are propelled in that tissue, they will produce different effects according to their nature, their sour, mild, and styptic qualities, &c. No injec- tion whatever will produce a quicker or a more striking effect than a mixture of opium, or itsOF ANIMAL LIFE. 335 different preparations with water; the instant the muscles feel its approach there is an end to their motions, they become paralyzed as it were. I have generally observed, that it is far prefer- able in making experiments respecting the con- tact of p'as, or of various other fluids, with mus- o 7 cles, to inflate or inject the intermuscular tissue of a living animal, than to tear the organ off and immerse it full of life in these fluids, as seve- ral authors have done, or than to lay bare a mus- cle, and direct upon it a current of gas, or to moisten it with a fluid, to observe the effects of contact. From all that has hitherto been stated, it fol- lows ; 1st. That to answer cerebral excitation by contracting, the muscles should in general be in a state determined by the laws of its organization, that once out of that state it will no longer ad- mit of contraction, or at least it will effect but weak and irregular contractions only ; 2dly. That the contract of the different heterogeneous sub- stances produces upon the muscles very varia- ble effects. Several other causes besides those above related, seem to influence the various con- tractions on acting directly upon the muscles ; such is" the use of mercurial friction for the vene- real disease ; the influence of that metal, copper and lead, upon those who labour in their prepa- ration, the action of cold, the effect of certain fevers, &c. The quivering of muscles arising from336 MUSCULAR NYSTUM these various causes does not appear to proceed from the brain, most generally, at least, in such cases, this organ does not appear the least af- fected. I confess, however, that in these affec- tions it is not easy to determine what proceeds from the state of the muscles, and what from that of the nerves; these organs perhaps are especially affected, but most undoubtedly the brain has no- thing to do with it. Causes that produce Animal Contractility. We have just seen, that in the natural state this property constantly requires three actions ; 1st. That of the brain; 2dly. That of the nerves; 3dly. That of the muscles : that the principle of motion originates from the brain, is propagated by the nerves, and received by the muscles ; but it is requisite that the influence of the brain be called forth by some other power ; animal con- tractility, in fact, being essentially intermittent, a fresh cause is required to excite it to action when- ever this action has ceased ; now in the natural state, this cause acts first upon the brain. The causes that excite this organ for the pro- duction of animal contractility, I refer to two causes. The first includes will; the second, every impression the brain receives, and which does not come within the empire of the soul. The brain is a medium between the soul andOF ANIMAL LIFE. 337 the nerves, in the same manner as nerves are be- tween the muscles and that organ ; the principle that constitutes will, first acts upon the brain, which subsequently re-acts. When thus produced, our motions are sometimes determined and regu- lar : it is when the intellectual functions are sound, when memory, imagination, and perception are in all their plenitude, that judgment being cor- rect, governs with regularity every act of the will:—at other times they are irregular ; as, when the intellectual functions variously disordered, produce an irregular and fantastic will, as in the different mental alienations, in dreams, in those ravings of fevers, &c.; but in all such instances they still are voluntary motions, and proceed from the immaterial principle by which we are animated. In the second class of causes which influence the brain, animal contractility becomes involun- tary ; it is exercised without the participation of the intellectual principle, frequently even against its will. Only observe the animal whose brain is artificially excited in our experiments ; he stiffens to oppose contractions—they take place in spite of him. If a nerve be punctured in an operation, the muscle will spontaneously contract below, without the mind interfering with the motion ; the patient is not even sensible of it, he is only sensi- ble of pain. If a great quantity of blood in the de- lirium of inflammatory fevers, be propelled to the brain, this organ, excited by the fluid, instantly vol. it. zMUSCULAR SYSTEM 338 re-acts upon the muscles, without the least inter- ference of the will. All the phenomena of con- traction and relaxation arising from the various incidents attending wounds in the head, cerebral inflammations, &c. are also involuntary, although residing in muscles habitually governed by the will; such are the different circumstances in which the action of any agent upon the brain is direct and immediate, in which a mechanical cause is applied to that organ. In other circumstances the brain is only sym- pathetically affected. In numerous acute affec- tions, what is termed delirium does not proceed from more blood being conveyed to this organ ; the pulse is not fuller, the face has not a deeper colour ; frequently even there are symptoms of relaxation in the vascular system. The brain, like every other organ, is affected by sympathy, a very accommodating word, a cloak for our ig- norance, in what regards the connections of the organs with each other; the brain then is affected in the same manner as the heart, the liver, &c. In peripneumony for instance, it is the lungs that are essentially injured, and from this essential and local injury proceed a multiplicity of sympathies more or less considerable. If the liver happen to be sympathetically affected, symptoms, termed bilious, are superadded to those of the original affection ; if the stomach suffer, sympathetic affections of that organ take place. The heart in every case is339 OF ANIMAL life. affected ; hence fever. Whenever the sympathetic influence is directed towards the brain, convul- sions and delirium are the consequences ; for as I have said, the state of the muscles proclaim the state of this organ. Now in this last circumstance, the will does not interfere with animal contracti- lity in exercise ; the patient could not possibly prevent himself from moving his muscles convul- sively; the sympathetic irritation of the brain overpowers the influence of the will. From this example of cerebral affection in peripneumony, although less frequent th&n in other affections, we may, however, form an idea of what takes place in every other case in which the muscles maybe convulsively agitated by the injury which any organ may sustain; by distention of the fibrous system, especially of ligaments of aponeuroses, by the cutting of the teeth, by the violent pains in the kidnies, in the salivary glands, or in the pancreas, from the presence of stone; by in- juries of the diaphragm, the nerves, &c. In all such cases one part in the economy is affected ; from this, sympathetic irradiations diverge, parti- cularly to the brain: this organ thus excited, comes into play, excites the muscles; and these contract without any operation of the will. This also explains why the strong passions, whose influence especially bears upon the internal organs, especially affect those situate round the epigastric region, the heart, the liver, the sto-muscular system 3+0 mach, the spleen, &c. and stamp our motions with a degree of* impetuosity we cannot even sup- press by the assistance of the will. The interior affected organ re-acts upon the brain. This once excited stimulates the muscles, they contract, and the will has hardly had any thing to do with the contraction. Let us only consider the man agi- tated to the utmost degree, by jealousy, hatred, and fury. All his motions succeed each other with an impetuosity judgment reproves, and the will cannot repress them, so much do the sympathetic affections of the brain predominate. At other times the passions display a reverse phenomenon ; they are characterized by a general debility of muscular motion. In amazement attended with grief, in that accompanied with excessive joy, the subject is rendered immoveable, the cerebral influence has almost wholly ceased, and yet it is not to the brain the influence of the passion has been transmitted, but to the epigastric centre, as is evidently proved by the sudden contraction it causes. One of the epigastric organs has been affected, it has re-acted upon the brain ; these have been interrupted in one part of their func- tions ; the muscles have been affected by it, and the functions of the latter are suspended. In fear, in which a similar phenomenon is ob- served, as the paleness of the face indicates an abatement in the circulation, it may happen that the cerebral and muscular inactivity inOK ANIMAL LIFE. 341 part depend upon this organ not receiving a suf- ficient impulse from the heart, upon which organ the first influence of this passion bears, and les- sens its motions. It is a vulgar saying, that fear deprives one of his legs ; it petrifies, &c. These expressions borrowed from vulgar language, pro- claim the effects of this passion upon the muscles ; but this effect is secondary only : the first influ- ence bears upon the heart, the second upon the brain ; in a third order only are the muscles af- fected. This explains why certain animals are rivetted to the spot at the sight of their voracious enemy, ready to make them a prey. To the sympathetic influence of the internal or- gans over the brain, the motions of the foetus must also be attributed, motions that are not directed by the will; for the will is only the result of intel- lectual phenomena. Now these phenomena are yet unexisting at that stage of life. The internal functions, very active at that period, suppose a considerable action in the liver, the heart, the spleen, &c. On this account these organs effectu- ally influence the brain, and this in turn brings the muscles into motion, so that animal contracti- lity is by no means voluntary in the foetus, it can become so only when sensation has brought the intellectual phenomena into play ; until then they should be assimilated to those here above-men- tioned. From all that has been said, will, I trust, easily342 MUSCULAR SYSTEM be conceived why animal contractility may or may not be submitted to the influence of the will. In both cases the series of phenomena it necessi- tates is invariably the same; there is always an excitement of the brain, transmission by the nerves, and action of the muscles, or a successive inaction of these three organs. The difference rests in the cause only by which the cerebral ex- citation is produced. Now this cause may be ; 1st. The will; 2dly. Any irritation immediately applied; 3d!y. A sympathetic irritation. It is very important to form a precise and correct idea of this vital power, which acts so essential a part in the living economy. \ Continuance of Animal Contractility after Death. The difference of causes that in animal contrac- tility act upon the brain to induce this organ to excite the muscles, is very obviously displayed at the moment of death. In whatever manner it is brought into action, the intellectual functions are always the first to cease, and it is to this we refer the idea of the absence of life. Hence it follows, that the very first phenomenon produced by this absence must necessarily be a deficiency of mus- cular contraction submitted to the influence of the will, which is the result of these intellectual functions. Every thing then in the muscular sys- tem remains in a passive state, if no cause acts upon the brain or upon the nerves; but these343 OF ANIMAL LIFE. two organs still for a considerable time answer to the different stimuli. In whatever manner the brain, the marrow, or the nerves of an animal recently killed be excited, the muscles are in- stantly convulsed ; it is the same phenomenon as that which occurs during life from a similar cause. This phenomenon is frequently more apparent im- mediately after death than previous to it, as I have repeatedly ascertained in my experiments. If, during life, any nerve be irritated, there will be scarcely any contraction, because the will acting at the same time upon the same muscles through other nerves, or at least upon those of the limb, contractions are opposed to those the irritation tended are produced. I have repeatedly noticed that the galvanic phenomena are also much more easily produced, even in animals provided with red and warm blood, an instant after death, than during life ; in the latter case there will be hardly any re- sult, because their influence is opposed by that of the brain. Whenever irritation is directly ap- plied to the brain, or to the superior part of the spine, it then overpowers the will; it is much stronger in the living animal; but in an isolated nerve, the contrary is the case ; not that the will acts by the irritated nerve, for in respect to this, influence is limited to the irritated spot; but it is affected by the adjacent nerves. To the susceptibility of the brain, and of the nerves, of transmitting after death, the principlemuscular system 314 of motion, must be referred all the phenomena produced by the different modes of decapitation. Ducks, geese, and other species of the feathered tribe, still move their voluntary muscles with some degree of regularity, after the head has been severed from the body, in running, jumping, and performing other motions, &c. Some time alter the fall of the guillotine, the upper and lower extremities still continue to quiver, and the muscles of the face, even by their contractions, have expressed different passions; expressions er- roneously referred to a surviving sensitive princi- ple in the brain. Similar phenomena were ob- served in that punishment formerly employed of beheading with the axe. Some time since I made a painful experiment of these singular facts: a guinea-pig, from which I had just ex- tracted the heart, thrust the four projecting teeth, by which this specie is distinguished, through one of my fingers. All these phenomena are merely the result of the irritation produced either by the instrument, or by the effect of air on the two surfaces of the division of the marrow. This is so perfectly correct, that, by increasing the irritation with a pointed or cutting instrument, &c. by a chemical agent applied to these extremi- ties, the motions will be considerably increased. This fact is easily ascertained on a living animal. I have frequently verified it on criminals who had suffered the guillotine, and on which subjects IOF ANIMAL LlFfi. Ho had been authorized to try galvanic experiments. This also explains why the alternate motions of respiration may be continued for a levy moments longer after the brain has been destroyed. In a wound of the head, by which the brain has been crushed, after a luxation of the first vertebrae, by which the origin of the spinal marrow has been so compressed as to destroy life immediately, or after injecting a very irritating fluid through the carotid, &c. &c. In this continuance of animal contractility after the cessation of life, the muscles are completely passive, they obey, as they did during life, the impulse given by the nerves: it is this which distinguishes it from irritability, a property by which, both in life and death, the muscle contains within itself, the principle of motion. According to the class to which the animal belongs, this continuance of animal contractility is more or less extended. Those possessed only of cold and red blood, retain that property much longer than those circulating red and warm blood ; amongst the latter, ducks are, as I have said, very remarkable for this phenomenon, which is longer continued than with other birds, or than with quadrupeds. The first class also admits of varieties, in reptiles, in fishes, &c. I have generally observed, that subsequent to death the source of animal contractility ceases, first in the brain, then in the marrow, and finallyMUSCU LA R SYSTEM 346 in the nerves. When the muscles have ceased to contract, on irritating the first of these organs, they may still be acted upon through the me- dium of the others. Motion may be produced by irritating the nerves, when we can no longer act upon the spinal marrow. I never observed that the superior part of the nerve is sooner deprived of this faculty than the inferior ; but a very re- markable instance is, that certain nerves, acting under the same influence, cause a stronger con- traction in their muscles than others; such, for in- stance, is the diaphragmatic. Every muscle has already lost all power of motion during the arti- ficial excitement to which its nerves are submit- ted, yet the diaphragm can still be moved by similar means. Whilst in other parts experiments flag, in this they are still in their plenitude, which is the more striking, that during life, the organ is precisely that which is the least affected by the state of the brain, or of the spinal marrow, and it scarcely ever, as we have observed, is subject to paralysis and convulsions. By thus comparing the permanence of animal contractility, the same stimulants should con- stantly be used ; for according to those selected, the effects are more or less striking. The brain and the nerves have already ceased to be affected by chemical or mechanical agents, but still con- tinue to be powerfully influenced by the galvanic power. Irritation from metals is, above all, thatOF ANIMAL LIFE. 347 which seems to afford the most effectual means of prolonging animal contractility for some time after death. Organic Properties. Organic sensibility is evidently allotted to the muscles we are considering ; incessantly brought into play in these organs, by nutrition, absorption and exhalation, it is still the better displayed, when the muscles laid bare are submitted to irritation ; they are sensible of this irritation, and the mo- bility we are about to mention is a result of this sensation, which is concentrated in the muscles, and cannot be referred to the brain. Insensible organic contractility is amongst the properties of the muscular system, as well as those of every other system. Sensible organic contractility is very obvious in these organs. If a muscle be laid bare in a living animal, and irritated by any agent what- ever, it will shrink, twist, and contract. A por- tion of muscle on being removed, will present a similar phenomenon for some length of time. Every thing becomes an exciting cause for a muscle laid bare; air, water, neutral salts, acids, alkalies, earths, metals, animal and vegetable substances, &c. The mere contact is sufficient to produce contraction ; however, besides this con- tact, there is still something which depends uponMUSCULAR SYSTEM 348 the nature of the stimulants, and causes a variety in the intensity of contractions. Dust of wood, coal, metal, &c. strewed over the muscles of a frog, will only produce slight motions; let a pulverized neutral salt, sea-salt for instance, be applied, and instantly irregular agitations, a thou- sand different oscillations are produced. All bodies are, by their nature, capable of acting dif- ferently upon the muscles, as according to age, constitutions, seasons, climate, &c. the muscles are susceptible of being affected. To cause a muscle to contract, it is not re- quisite that the whole should be excited; two or three fibres only are sufficient to put all the others in motion. Frequently, even when these experiments are tried on a living animal, the contraction is extended from one muscle to the other. In general, I have remarked that during life these experiments are attended with more dif- ficulty, and give more variable results in what, as I have previously stated, regards animal contrac- tility. If a muscle be laid bare and excited at in- tervals ; at one time, it will not give the slightest appearance of contractility; at another time it will be strongly contracted, and this variation takes place from one instant to the other; whilst, if an animal recently killed, be selected for the experiment, the results, within a certain time, are always nearly the same, admitting of this dis- tinction only, that the contractions are less inOF ANIMAL LIFE. 349 proportion, as we recede from the moment of death. A muscle is never left wholly insensible to stimulants, as is frequently the case during life. This essential distinction, too long over- looked by authors, and which I have frequently verified on different animals, proceeds from the effects of the nervous influence which, during life, opposes that of the stimulant; for instance, if an animal extend the thigh, the action cannot be counterpoised by laying bare, and it will be to no purpose exciting the antagonist muscles. The influence of the brain upon the extensors being more powerful than the mechanical irrita- tion of the flexors, the former have the advan- tage. During the application of the stimulant, the brain often acts powerfully upon the muscles, and the effect more than counterbalances that artificially produced. This appears surprising, but our surprise ceases if we consider that there are two distinct exciting causes ; namely, that of the external agent and that of the brain. In general, those who have tried experiments upon living animals, have not paid sufficient attention to this concurrence of two different powers. In order to estimate correctly sensible organic contractility, the animal sensibility should be de- stroyed; for as long as they are simultaneously ex- cited, they check, and counterbalance each other, and it is impossible to ascertain accurately what be- iongs to the one, and what to the other, or what they350 MUSCULAR SYSTEM share in common. Now animal contractility in the living body, may be destroyed by dividing every nerve of a muscle or of a limb, which is then completely paralyzed. The brain can no longer act upon them, and every result obtained by stimulants, essentially belongs to the sensible organic contractility. The permanence of this last property, after the experiment I have pointed out, evidently proves that the nerves have no- thing to do with it, that it essentially resides in the muscular tissue,—is inherent, as Haller has ex- pressed it. Thus, whilst in the different species of paralysis the muscles are deprived of the faculty of obeying the cerebral influence, or ra- ther this influence being annulled, they retain the power of contracting in a visible manner. This contraction, from a co-operation of sti- mulants upon the muscles of animal life, is dis- played in two very distinct modes. 1st. The whole of the muscle may be contracted, and shrink in such a manner as to cause the two points of origin and insertion to approximate; a circumstance that generally occurs after death, when the muscles are still replete with life. 2ndly. There are frequently multiplied and simultaneous % oscillations of the fibres; but this is not a con- traction, but only a vibration, a quivering, which has no evident effect upon the whole of the mus- cle which does not contract; an action which takes place when life has almost forsaken the muscle.OF ANIMAL LIFE. 351 The difference, also, of the exciting cause, occa- sions this twofold mode of contraction ; if the knife be moved over a muscle full of life, a com- plete contraction will be the result; if the same organ then be strewed with a neutral salt, a simi- lar contraction is sometimes produced ; but fre- quently there is nothing more than an oscilla- tion, or vibration, similar to that observed in a muscle that is nearly deprived of life. During the life of an animal, its sensible or- ganic contractility is seldom brought into play, because the muscles have no agents that act upon them, at least in a sensible manner. Why is it, then, that this property is so considerable ? I cannot account for it. Every muscle is not possessed of this property in an equal degree; the diaphragm and the inter* costals are the most irritable; in these, also, orga- nic contractility is continued for a longer time after death. It may be remarked that this, as well as their readiness to admit of the nervous in- fluence, from artificial irritation, particularly of the diaphragmatic nerve, forms a contrast with the difficulty with which, during life, they are affected by convulsions and palsy in turn. Next to these the masseter, the buccinator, &c. are the most irritable muscles; form respect to irritability there is an essential distinction between these and the muscles of the limbs, which are nearly all equally affected by the operation of stimulants.352 MUSCULAR SYSTEM Besides, after a multiplicity of experiments, we can only form general notions, for nothing is more common than to find different results from two similar muscles, and even in the two correspond- ing muscles of the same body. Sympathies. The muscular system of animal life acts a very important part in sympathies. This system is fre- quently seen in the different affections of our organs, agitated with irregular motions; in the infant especially, in which every powerful im- pression received by any organ is most generally attended with spasmodic and convulsive motions in the muscles of animal life. Animal contracti- lity, in fact, is the predominant vital property of this system, and is that which in sympathies is most frequently brought into action. In general it appears, that whenever animal sensibility is developed in one of our organs to some extent, this system instantly tends to con- tract. The acute pains caused by stones in the kidnies and uninary passages, the distentions of ligaments, of aponeuroses, dentition, chirurgical operations that have been very painful to the pa- tient, &c. frequently give rise to convulsions. I am conscious there are very acute pains, unat- tended with sympathetic convulsive motions; but convulsive motions of this nature are seldom353 OF ANIMAL LIFE. observed without the organ which is the source of the sympathy being considerably affected, and the focus of animal sensibility. On the contrary, the greatest number of sym- pathies which display in a part insensible or sen- sible organic contractility to a considerable de- gree, are not characterized by those excruciating pains in the affected organ from which the ex- citement emanates; for instance, the sympathetic perspirations and secretions, the intestinal and gastric contractions, are seldom produced by af- fections bearing the character of those from which the sympathies of animal contractility arise. The brain is always first affected in the latter species of sympathies, in which the muscles are, as it were, in a passive state, and wherein they merely obey the impulse they have received. The affected organ first acts upon the brain, which subsequently re-acts upon the muscles. Authors have viewed sympathies in too vague a manner. Some have admitted, whilst others have rejected the interposition of the brain; some have not decided. All would have agreed, if instead of attempting to resolve the question in a general manner, they had viewed sympa- thies in the same manner as the vital powers, from which they are only aberrations or irregular developements; they would have found that in animal sympathies of contractility, the cerebral influence was essentially requisite, for no con- VOL. II. A A354 MUSCULAR SYSTEM traotility of this kind can be conceived, without the twofold influence of the brain and nerves upon the muscles; that, on the contrary, in the organic sympathies of contractility* the brain is not concerned, the affected organ acting directly upon that which sympathetically contracts, and without any intermedium. Whenever the heart, the stomach, the intestines, &c. move ; whenever the parotid gland, and the others increase their action by the sympathetic influence of a diseased organ, most undoubtedly this organ does not first act upon the brain, for in this case it would be requisite for this organ to re-act upon those which contract. Now this influence could only be con- veyed through the nerves, since, by the nerves only, the brain is connected with them; but every experiment, every fact, concurs to prove that the brain has not, through this medium, the least influence upon the organs of involuntary mo- tion, the action of which is not secondary. In this respect the sympathetic motions are similar to the natural ones ; sensible and insensible con- tractilities are constantly increased by a stimulant directly applied to the organ, whilst animal con- tractility never acts but by cerebral influence, which itself -requires either a sympathetic or a direct cause to act upon the muscles. Next to animal contractility, sensibility of the same nature is in the muscular system of animal life, that which is the most frequently and sympa-355 OF ANIMAL LIFE. thetically forced into action. The sensations of weariness, of dull pains, that of heaviness, the draggings felt in the limbs at the commencement of many diseases, are nothing more than sympa- thetic phenomena, in which this property is excited in the muscles. These sympathetic dis- turbances are also very remarkable at the ter- mination of several other affections, but in gene- ral less so than at the commencement. In the species of muscles now under considera- tion, the organic properties are seldom seen to act sympathetically ; however, if they do act, we cannot judge of them, since they are not demon- strable. Perspiration in the skin, the secreted fluids in the glands, the fluids exhaled over a num- ber of surfaces, are general results which proclaim sympathetic derangement of organic sensibility, and insensible organic contractility. In muscles we are denied these means of ascertaining such alterations. Characters of the Vital Properties. From all that has been hitherto stated respect- ing the muscular properties and sympathies, it will easily be conceived that vital activity must in general be more developed in muscles than in any other organ that has yet been examined in this volume ; consequently all their affections be- gm to resume a peculiar character which makes A A 2356 MUSCULAR SYSTEM them distinct from those of the other organs; they are quicker and much more rapid. It should be remarked, however, that every altera- tion in the functions which they display, will enable us to appreciate that vital activity accu- ratelv : in fact, a number of these alterations do not essentially reside, or arise in, the muscular tissue; such, for instance, as the conekisive mo- tions, in which, as we have seen, the muscles act by obeying, but do not possess the principle of action. They indicate in such cases the state of the brain. Thus the arteries only passive, by innumerable varieties of pulsation, indicate the state of the heart, whilst the veins unprovided in their origin with a similar impulsive agent, very seldom present varieties of motion, although their tissue is endowed with as much, or perhaps more, vital activity than the arteries. A proof that the tissue itself in muscles is not so frequently changed as might perhaps at first be supposed, on considering the numerous affec- tions of these organs, is the scarcity of their or- ganic diseases. These even are not so frequently met with as in bones. No indurations, none of those collections, of those changes of texture in a word, so frequently observed in the other organs, have ever been ascertained in these. Amongst the great number of subjects I have dissected, or caused to be dissected, I cannot recollect one single in- stance of any other alteration in the muscles ofOF ANIMAL LIFE. 357 animal life, except those of their cohesion, den- sity, and hue. By these phenomena they are nearly assimilated to those that belong to organic life, in which changes in the tissue are seldom as- certained, as the heart, the stomach, &c. afford in- stances of. The muscular tissue of animal life rarely sup- purates ; hence we are but imperfectly acquainted with its mode of suppuration. Inflammation of these organs appears generally to terminate by re-solution. Induration, gangrene, and suppura- tion, a treble issue .'fo.r This affection in other or- gans, have seemingly^ in the greatest number of cases, nothing to do with it in this. ARTICLE IV. Phenomena of the Action of the Muscular System of Animal Life. So far we have treated of muscular motion only, with the exception of the phenomena it presents in the muscles when in a state of activity. These phenomena will now come under consideration. They relate particularly to contraction, which is, in fact, the active state of the muscle, relaxation constantly being merely passive. The phenomena of these will be easily conceived, after the others, which are quite the reverse, have been properly investigated.358 MUSCULAR SYSTEM SECTION II. Powers of the Muscular Contraction. The power of contraction in the muscles of life varies excessively, accordingly as it has been brought to act by mechanical agents, or by cere- bral influence. Every irritating substance applied to a muscle laid bare, will produce an abrupt, rapid, but not an energetic motion; by my experiments, I have frequently convinced myself it was impossible by these means to approach even remotely the ex- cessive degree of energy communicated by the brain to the muscles of animal life. The muscular system of organic life, principally put in motion by stimulants immediately applied, never displays exacerbations corresponding to those which, in peculiar circumstances, is displayed so conspicu- ously by animal contractility. The power of contraction then should be examined, when the muscles are moved, in virtue of this last property. Now this contraction may, as we have seen, be determined by; 1st. Exciting the brain in expe- riments ; 2dly. When this excitement takes place in the natural state, by the power, by the will, or by sympathy. In the first case, the power of contraction is never very energetic, whatever may be the exciting agent, either applied to the brain or to the denuded nerves. I have constantly ob-359 OF ANIMAL LIFE. « served, that the convulsive motion is very rapid, similar to that obtained by exciting* the very muscles themselves. Notwithstanding what some physiologists have written, it is impossible, by irritating a flexor, to produce that powerful con- traction, a contraction comparable with that which is voluntary. If, after amputation of an inferior extremity, tfye sciatic nerve be ex- cited, the toes will never bend with the same force which they frequently display in their na- tural state. In amputations performed by De- sault, I have made this experiment twice, and at that time ignorant of physiology, I was very much struck with this phenomenon. It is not possible by irritating the brain or spinal marrow, to appreciate the powers of con- traction with that same accuracy as when an iso- lated nerve has been excited : in fact, the whole system coming convulsively into action, the ex- tensors partly destroy the efforts of the flexors, and vice versa ; the muscles simultaneously put in motion, check, and counterbalance each other. Galvanism has always appeared to me the most powerful agent for producing npuscular contraction. During life, the degree of muscular contraction depends upon two causes ; 1st. On the muscle ; 2dly. On the brain. These two causes are in variable proportions,—they should be con- sidered separately. Acted upon by the same power, the muscieMUSCULAR SYSTEM 360 that is well nourished, and is strongly depicted through the integuments, because its fibres are very thick, will contract more powerfully than the thin emaciated muscle, whose fibres, loose and pale, are hardly seen to project. In estimating the degree of muscular power, we always refer to the appearance of the muscle; the statues that represent power and strength. constantly display an energetic developement of muscular forms. When the brain operates with energy upon such muscles, the extraordinary motions they are capable of performing are beyond con- ception. Haller and others have quoted a mul- tiplicity of instances of their astonishing powers ; either of those of the back, to bear burthens, or the superior extremities to lift up weights, or of the inferiors to perform extraordinary leaps, or maintain attitudes by which it is supposed that enormous resistance is surmounted. It is the cerebral influence in particular that increases the power of muscular contraction. The will may exalt that power to a high degree; but other causes that are independent of the will, render that power infinitely greater. The addi- tional strength acquired by passion, by a state of insanity, that observed in subjects labouring un- der delirium in consequence of violent fever, &c. are sufficiently obvious. In all such cases, the impulse conveyed by the brain will sometimes be such, that the smallest muscle of the weakest361 OF ANIMAL LIFE. of females will much exceed in energy those of the most powerful man considered in the natural state. The power of the muscular contraction then depends upon the strength of the organization in the tissue of the muscles, and of the degree of cerebral excitement; if both happen to be weak, there will hardly be any motion at all; if both exist in the highest degree, it will be difficult to conceive the consequences that may result:—a maniac, whose muscles are thick and powerful, is capable of exertions that will baffle all calcu- lations ; but when the nervous power is very energetic, and the muscular tissue weak, or when the case is the reverse, the phenomena are less. Nature has in general united these properties in the latter state. Women and children, characte- rized by the debility of the fleshy tissue, are very sensitive ; men, on the contrary, particularly those distinguished by athletic forms, are less easily affected, and those causes which act powerfully upon the muscular system, are consequently less numerous. In whatever point of view we consider the powers of contraction in the muscular system of animal life, it is very considerable in proportion to the effects that result from these contractions. In the animal economy nature follows a law, the re- verse of that which governs the motions of our me- chanical machines,the essential advantage of which362 MUSCULAR SYSTEM is to produce considerable effect with little power ; here we constantly observe considerable power to produce little effect, which is owing to the numerous causes that tend to destroy the ef- fects of these powers; 1st. Most generally the muscles act under very unfavourable circum- stances, as the power they represent is nearer to the point of pressure than the resistance is ; 2dly. All muscles on contracting have to encounter their antagonists ; 3dly. As in every motion there is always a fixed point, the effort which in conse- quence of the contraction bears upon that point is totally lost; 4thly. Motion is also impeded by friction ; Sthly. The obliquity of the insertions of muscles in bones, an obliquity which in general approaches much nearer the horizontal than the perpendicular direction. The not less remarkable obliquity of the fleshy insertions on the tendon or the aponeuroses, afford a twofold cause for re- ducing the motion. All these motives, and a multiplicity of others which might be added in common with Borrelli, who first made these im- portant remarks on muscular motion, prove that the absolute or real power of the muscles is much superior to their effective power. All, however, are not so disadvantageously placed ; in some, as in the soleus, the insertion is perpendicular with the bone ; in others, as in the muscles that act upon the head, it is observed they have the power of first rate levers in general. To form a363 OF ANIMAL LIFE- proper estimation of the powers of an isolated muscle, of the deltoid for instance, the distance between its insertion and the point of resistance, the degree of opening of the angles formed by the fleshy fibres upon the tendon, and subsequently by the tendon upon the bone, with the distribu- tion of the powers between the fixed and the moveable points, should be particularly consi- dered. A few advantages seem with some muscles to compensate slightly for their unfavourable posi- tion for not admitting of powerful motion; such are; 1st. The sesamoid bones, the patella, the different prominences for insertion, the enlarge- ment of the long bones at their extremities, &c. by which the distance between the fibres and the moveable points is increased ; 2dly. The inter- muscular fat, that which surrounds the muscles, the fluid of the synovial sheaths which promotes motion by moistening the surfaces of the respec- tive organs; 3dly. The aponeurotic expansions which reflect the motions over the limbs; 4thly. The motion itself, that of flexion for instance, which gradually, as it takes place, lessens the ob- liquity of the insertion of the flexors, and even renders it perpendicular, as a modern author has judiciously observed. The losses sustained by the muscular motion, the exertion performed by a muscle on contract- ing, compared with the effect, have undergone364 MUSCULAR SYSTEM numerous calculations. None of them could ever be correct, because the vital powers vary ad infinitum, and are never the same in two indivi- duals, because cerebral influence, and the power of muscular organization, are never found in an uniform proportion in the same subject. It is in the very nature of the vital phenomena to baffle all calculations, as it is in that of the powers they emanate from to display a character of irregula- rity which renders them perfectly distinct from the phenomena of physics. Let us merely con- clude from the preceding observations, that mus- cular exertions carried to the utmost by cerebral excitement, may produce astonishing effects, which effects admit of a power of contraction hardly to be conceived ; such are the ruptures of strong tendons, that of the patella, of the olecra- non, &c.; such is again the powerful resistance frequently opposed by the muscles to the enor- mous distentions required in cases of luxation, in those of fracture, &c. SECTION II. Rapidity of Contractions. Contractions ought to be considered both in respect to their rapidity and their powers. 1st. If they are produced by stimulants, by laying a muscle bare and by acting directly upon365 OF ANIMAL LIFE. it, they vary according to the vitality of the mus- cle and the nature of the stimulant. At the com- mencement of experiments, they succeed each other with astonishing rapidity, and sometimes this rapidity is such, that the eye cannot discern all their motions. As the organ becomes languid, its contractions become slower, and after some time they completely cease ; but they may be re- newed by using a very active stimulant, which also ultimately ceases to produce any effect. 2dly. If a voluntary muscle be caused to con- tract by irritating the nerve, more rapid contrac- tions will result than by irritating the muscle it- self. The rapidity in the act of running would be incalculable, if each contraction were equal to that produced by these means, particularly of animals endowed with considerable vitality on the one part, and very powerful stimulants, such as galvanism for instance, on the other, be selected for the experiment. I have remarked in this re- spect, that the rapidity and the powers of con- tractions are not in general more increased by irritating at the same time all the nerves that re- sort to a muscle, than by irritating a single one only. 3dly. Whenever the rapidity of muscular con- traction is governed by the will, that rapidity admits of innumerable varieties; but there is al- ways a degree that can never be exceeded. This366 MUSCULAR SYSTEM degree is not the same in every subject, even in this respect they differ essentially from each other ; but this has nothing to do with the powers of organization in the muscles ; it rarely happens that the same individuals who display great mus- cular powers, are the best runners. I am not aware that any connexion between the external appear- ance of the body, and the rapidity of contractions has been observed, as there is one to indicate their power ; but still it must exist. The degree of ra- pidity of which men and animals are susceptible, varies ad infinitum. I shall not produce instances of rapid speed, of analogous motions performed by the superior limbs, as by the fingers, in play- ing on various instruments, the violin, the flute, &c.; of these numerous authors have quoted sur- prizing examples: I shall merely observe, there are few motions that will convey so correct an idea of this rapidity, as the abrupt and quick con- tractions of the inferior extremities produced by the act of leaping, or their forcible projection in that of kicking; those which in the superior extremities serve to project heavy bodies; those which in the same organs thrust the trunk backwards; when pressing against a resisting surface, we extend them suddenly, and throw back the motion upon the trunk ; those again which occur in giving a blow with the fist; those which produce that abrupt motion of theOF ANIMAL LIFE. 367 fingers from which, what is commonly called a fillip, results, &c. &c. I consider all these mo- tions as nearly similar to the act of leaping, dif- fering from this act only in the effects they pro- duce, It may be noticed that authors have not sufficiently assimilated all these variously rapid and abrupt contractions, for the act of leaping has been viewed in too abstract a manner : but let us return to our subject. The rapidity of muscular contractions, is powerfully subordinate to practice. The habit of exercising certain muscles, gives us more facility in contracting them ; for instance, the habit of walking, which exercises alternately the flexors and extensors, enables us to run with great rapidity. If any one will habituate himself to this last exercise, he will very soon attain the utmost degree of rapidity of which his muscular system will admit. The motions of adduction and abduction, on the contrary, being more rarely performed in the ordinary state, require in dan cers a considerable and long continued practice to enable them to perform with agility those steps in which the legs cross each other alternately. Habit in general has much greater influence on the rapidity than the degree of contraction ; by practice, any one may leap or run with more or less agility.368 MUSCULAR SYSTEM SECTION irr. Duration of the Contractions. In respect to the duration of contractions, there are in muscles very remarkable distinctions, ac- cordingly as these contractions have been artifi- cially or naturally produced. If in a living animal, or in one recently killed, the muscle itself, or its nerves, be stimulated, re- laxation will almost immediately succeed to con- traction, but neither of these states will be of any duration; for whatever length of time the excite- ment is continued, the effect produced is instantly exhausted. If galvanism, or mechanical and che- mical agents, be selected for experiments, the phenomenon will be the same. When, on the contrary, the contraction is di- rected by the will, it may be continued for a con- siderable time. The position, &c. in supporting burdens, evidently prove this fact; even when during life, a morbid irritation acts upon the nerves, the contraction may continue, dreadful instances of which we find in tetanus. A permanent state of contraction will fatigue the muscle much more than alternate contrac- tions and relaxations: this explains why, when- ever a stationary position is long continued, we alternately bring the body to bear more upon one limb than upon the other.369 OF ANIMAL LIFE. SECTION IV. State of the Muscle during Contraction. The muscles on contracting, present divers phenomena, which are as follows :— 1st. They become evidently harder, as may easily be ascertained by placing the hand on the masseter, the temporal, or on any other super- ficial muscle whatever, when contracted. 2dly. They increase in thickness: hence the stronger projection of every sub-cutaneous mus- cle, whilst the body is in violent agitation. The sculptor is sensible of this difference. The figure that moves, is represented very differently from that at rest. Sdly. When the muscles are not maintained by the aponeuroses, they sometimes undergo slight displacements. 4thly. They decrease in length, and therefore their two insertions are brought nearer together. 5thly. Their volume remains nearly the same; what is lost in the length, is nearly compensated for by the thickness. The question whether this proportion is very exact, and of which so much has been said since it was proposed by Glisson, is not deserving of attention. 6thly. The blood contained in the vessels of the muscles, in the veins particularly, is partly ex- pressed ; the very act of bleeding proves it; for VOL. II. B BMUSCULAR SYSTEM 370 the current of blood is increased by the motions of the arm. 7thly. The colour of the muscle, however, is not changed ; this proceeds from its not being the colouring portion of the blood circulated with this fluid in the vessels of muscles that supplies them with colour, but, as I have said before, that which exists in their tissue, and is combined with their fibres. Now this colouring matter remains the very same either in the state of contraction or in that of relaxation. The heart of a frog fades on contracting; but this is because the blood it contained is evacuated, and by the trans- parency of its parieties, the phenomenon is dis- played very obviously. 8thly. On contracting, the muscles disclose a multiplicity of small transverse wrinkles, parti- cularly striking in oscillatory contractions, less apparent in those which are complete, and nearly wanting in a muscle that is laid bare in a living animal, as it contracts with some degree of force. 9thly. Authors have considered contractions too uniformly : they have described their pheno- mena in such a manner, as to suppose that in every instance the muscular contraction is the same; but the state of a muscle at that time ad- mits of a multiplicity of distinctions; 1st. Slow and almost insensible contraction, produced by the contractility of tissue, whenever a muscle has371 OF ANIMAL LI FF. been divided, or its antagonist deprived of mo- tion in paralysis ; 2dly. The abrupt and sudden contraction produced by the will, or by exciting a nerve, the most common mode of motion either in the natural state, or in that of convulsions ; 3dly. The kind of oscillation I have just men- tioned, and which, affecting every individual fibre in a muscle, will not, however, produce any sen- sible effect on the whole ; reduces it but indiffe- rently, and consequently does not cause its move- able points to approximate. This is the mode of motion in the shiverings attending cold, fear, and the accession of intermittent fevers, &c. On applying the apparatus requisite for the ex- periment in the bare muscle of an animal shiver- ing under the application, this kind of contraction is found perfectly to resemble that produced by strewing with pulverised salt, a part of the mus- cular system : then, although there is in every muscle an internal motion, much more striking than in considerable contractions, the position of the limbs is but slightly affected ; there is hardly any general motion. 10. There are also other motions of contraction less apparent than these, but still rather different. In general, a peculiar mode of contraction is adapted to each species of muscular motion : how- ever limited may be our experiments upon living animals, we may easily conceive how far the B B 2MUSCULAR SYSTEM 372 most judicious authors have been misled in this respect. Two modes of contraction are frequently com- bined : for instance ; when a muscle is divided on a living subject, first a slow general contrac- tion, produced by the contractility of tissue, will be observed, then partial oscillations in every di- vided fibre Now these oscillations have nothing to do with the retraction, which would take place without them, frequently in the living subject, and always in the corpse. In the same manner these oscillations may be combined with the sud- den contractions arising from the nervous influence produced by the action of the will, such as hap- pen in the last moments of our existence, or may not be conilected with them, as is generally the case when the animal enjoys life in all its pleni- tude. This last fact may be easily ascertained without the help of experiments, by applying the hand to the masseter muscle, or to the biceps of an emaciated subject; whilst they contract, not the slightest motion resembling oscillation will be felt under the skin. section v. Motions produced by the Muscles. Every muscular motion is either a simple motion or a combined one. Let us now inves-373 OF ANIMAL LIFE ligate the former, it will facilitate the study of the latter. Simple Motion. This should be considered; 1st. In the muscles that follow a strait direction; 2dly. In those of a reflected one; 3dly. In those which assume the circular direction. In the first, as in the limbs of the trunk, if they are of a lengthened shape, and terminate in a tendon, each fibre on contracting draws the tendon on its side; from whence there results, that all contribute to draw it nearer to the centre of the muscle, but that each of them at the same time tend to give it another direction, and in this respect they are antagonists; the common motion remains ; the opposed one is destroyed. In long muscles, the whole effort of the contrac- tion is concentrated on a single point of the tendon. In the greatest part of wide muscles on the contrary, the insertions being in the sides and by different points, all the fibres have not an uniform action. Thus different parts of the same muscle may be intended for very different and even for opposite uses ; thus the lower part of the serratus-major does not act like the upper ; fre- quently even different portions of the same mus- cles do not contract simultaneously. In the long muscles on the contrary, as every fibre concurs374 MUSCULAIl SYSTEM to produce the same effect, they all act at the same moment. Various means have been used to ascertain the effect a muscle of a straight direction might pro- duce on the bone in which it is implanted. This, which has not been pointed out, appears to me very simple. I believe it consists in examining the direction of the muscle from its fixed up to the moveable points, and to follow the reverse of that direction : this last is infallibly that of mo- tion : if it be intended to ascertain how the ante- rior radial acts upon the wrist, let us begin at its attachment to the condyle, follow from this its course in the inferior and outward direction, and we shall find it moves the hand upwards and downwards, that it bends it and rather brings it in adduction. The anterior tibial directed down- wards and inwards, raises the foot and brings it outwards: the rectus femoris, directed in a straight line from the pelvis towards the patella, raises the leg without causing the least deviation ; every other muscle displays the same disposition. Whatever may be the attachments which serve as a fixed or moveable point, they will always act in a reverse sense of their line of direction sup- posed to have begun at the first point, and as every insertion may in turn be the move- able or fixed point, the two bones are moved in reverse directions; the coraco brachialisOF ANIMAL LIFE. 375 directed downwards and outwards from the shoulder towards the arm, moves the latter up- wards and inwards. By this general rule, it is only sufficient to see a muscle in the corpse to decide for what uses it was intended. Whenever the whole of a wide muscle is con- centrated in one common point, such as the del- toid, which arising above by a multiplicity of parts, is inserted below by a single tendon, the average direction of all its fibres should be chosen to ap- preciate its uses. When a muscle is attached by several points at its two extremities, consequently, when the fibres it is composed of, form different skains of diffe- rent directions and separate motions, the line of direction of each bundle should be examined to judge of the action of the muscle. It is in this manner that we should study those of the trape- zius, of the serratus major, the rhomboideus, &c. In muscles that are reflected, as the great ob- lique of the eye, the peronei, the staphylinus ex- ternus, &c., the action of the muscle should be cal- culated from the point of reflexion only : thus the great oblique moves the eye inwards, notwith- standing that its fleshy portion contracts in such a manner as to carry the moveable point back- wards. The orbiculares, those situate round the lips, the eyes, the arms, &c. have in general no fixed or moveable poirfi ; they are not intended to bringMUSCULAR SYSTEM 376 two parts together, but merely to contract the aperture round which they are situate. The anus, when it is not dilated by the faeces, is closed by its sphincter. The mouth remains shut as long as the depressors, the levators, and the ab- ductors of the lips remain inactive. The eye remains shut as long as the levator of the upper eyelid is relaxed. I observe in this respect, that the lower eyelid not being provided with a de- pressor, it is the other which essentially concurs to open or shut the eye, and as its muscle cannot remain in a permanent state of contraction, its alternate relaxations produce that repeated wink- ing which takes place when the eyes are open; they are to the eye, what the alternate transfers of weight from one leg to the other are to these limbs when the body is stationary. At every in- stant, the muscle relaxes, and the sphincter in- stantly contracts; it contracts, and the sphincter is distended : winking then, is formed by the ha- bitual contention between the levators and the or- bicular muscles. During sleep, the eye is not closed by the contraction of this muscle; it is relaxed like the rest, because the preceding being inac- tive, the eyelid drops downwards by its own weight; it communicates, as it were, the motion to the orbicular muscle it contains; whereas, during the day, it is the latter that communicates that motion.OF ANIMAL LIFE. 377 Compound Motions. There are but very few single motions in the economy ; but very few muscles that contract in an isolated manner. Almost every kind of con- traction supposes another; and this is the reason, the two points by which a muscle is commonly inserted have an equal tendency to move : if one of the two were not prevented, both then would come into motion when the muscle contracts: thus, by the contraction of the extensors, the leg would be brought almost as near to the foot, as the foot is to the leg, if this were not fixed : but it can only be so, by the muscles acting in a reverse sense to the extensors; now, when- ever the two points of attachment are move- able, the isolated motion of one of the two, sup- poses the contraction of divers muscles to fix the other. No other muscles than those inserted by one of their extremities to a fixed, and by the other to a moveable point, as those of the eye, the greatest part of those of the face, are enabled to move in an isolated manner without requiring any motion in other muscles. Let us remark, however, that in general the contraction intend- ed to fix the point, which, in the ordinary mo- tions must remain the immoveable point is less considerable than might be thought at first. In378 MUSCULAR SYSTEM fact, in these ordinary motions, the point that is moved is always the most moveable, that which remains motionless is less so ; for instance, much more exertion is required from the flexors to bend the arm over the fore-arm, than to reflect the phalanges over this, and this over the arm. Supposing their two points of attachment to be moveable, the gastrocnemii would act more effec- tually upon the foot than upon the femur, &c. In the limbs the superior point is constantly more moveable than the inferior : now the other being fixed, it is this wThich generally moves, for as by its position it offers more resistance, less exertion is required from the muscular powers to retain it. It is only in rather violent motions that the pre- liminary contraction of the muscles intended to fix one of the points of attachment is very painful. Such is the case in the chest, when the trapezius, the serratus major, or the pectoralis major con- tract powerfully: then the other muscles of that cavity strongly contract to dilate it, and thus af- ford to these muscles which move the shoulder, in the carrying burdens and other similar exer- tions, firmer and wider insertions. The dia- phragm also contracts ; hence, ruptures produced by counter strokes, in such motions, which seem at first glance not to bear the slightest analogy with the abdominal cavity. Whenever the body is in an horizontal position, and the head is up,3T9 OF ANIMAL LIFE. the rectus abdominis contracts to fix the chest, and afford to the sterno-mastoideus, &c. a firm • Compound motion is that simultaneously pro- duced when two or several muscles act upon the same point. In this case, the moveable point follows the direction of neither of these muscles, if there are two, but the diagonal of their two- fold direction. Thus it is that the eye is moved out- ward and upward, outward and downward, &c.; that the head is lowered and carried to the right or to the left, and the arm is applied over the trunk, &c. In general, nature has placed the muscles around a moveable point, in particular directions only ; for instance, round the eye, in those of ele- vation and depression of adduction and abduction, the combination of these single motions produces the compound ones. If the adductor and de- pressor contract equally, the eye is maintained in a medium position; but if one act more forcibly than the other, the eye is directed accordingly; so that the four muscles, by moving separately, or two by two, with equal force, move the eye in eight different directions. There is also in all the intermediate directions a simultaneous ac- tion of two muscles, but, in point of force, one always predominates, thus it is that almost every motion of circumduction is performed. Whenever two muscles opposed to each other contract,the moveable point remains fixed. When380 MUSCULAR SYSTEM two muscles that simultaneously contract are placed in the same direction, there is no waste of power : this is what happens when the genio-hy- oidei and the mylo-hyoidei lower the jaw, or raise the os-hyoides; they act conjointly: but when two muscles are partly opposed to each other, and partly in the same sense as the sterno-mas- toidei, a part of the power is wasted, the other part remains. The action by which the sterno- mastoidei tend to direct the head to the right and left, is null; that only by which the head is in- clined produces its effect, which is twofold, consi- dering the action of the two muscles, which are also at the same time assistants and antagonists. From this it is obvious, that these words not only apply to the motion produced by the contracti- lity of the tissue, but also very frequently to those produced by animal contractility. % SECTION VI. Phenomena of the Relaxation of Muscles. Whenever a muscle has ceased to contract, it presents properties quite the reverse of the pre- ceding, which should be understood in order to investigate the latter. The muscle lengthens and softens, ceases to be corrugated, and is perfectly restored to the state it was in : to present a series of these phenomena would not answer any useful purpose. I have remarked, that in the state ofOF ANIMAL LIFE. 381 relaxation, parts frequently perform motions aris- ing merely from their weight: such are the flexions of the head, the dropping of the arm and fore- arm, during sleep. In such cases gravity is opposed to that power by which the limbs are maintained in their medium position. Instances of these phenomena are frequently met with in paralytic subjects. ARTICLE V. « Dev elopement of the Muscular System of Animal Life. The muscular system presents important dis- tinctions, accordingly as it is investigated during growth, or at a later period. SECTION i. State of the Muscular System in the Foetus. During the first months, this system, like the rest, is confounded in a mucous homogeneous mass, in which no traces of aponeuroses, muscles, tendons, &c. can be discovered; every thing, in short, bears the same appearance ; by degrees, the limits are drawn ; the muscular tissue is first seen to assume a deeper colour, owing to the blood by which it is permeated. This line, however, is notMUSCULAR SYSTEM 382 in the beginning as deep as in the adult, it even remains such until birth ; if the bones be selected for comparison, this becomes striking. In the adult, the interior of the bones is not as red as the muscular tissue; the difference is very remarkable ; in the foetus it is quite the reverse; the parts of the bones already ossified, are impregnated with a greater quantity of blood than the interior of the muscles. In the two dis- tant periods of life nature has distributed this \ fluid for the two systems in quite a reverse order. This phenomenon I conceive essentially de- pends upon the activity of the muscles previous to birth. It may be remarked, in fact, that al- though during the last months of pregnancy, some motions denote the presence of the foetus in the womb, yet these motions, however, are not so striking as afterwards. The proofs are, in the permanent position, assumed by the limbs and the trunk, half bent, in the narrow space allowed for motions particularly in the latter period of pregnancy, when the quantity of the fluid is very considerably diminished. Although during the / early months the space be more extensive, yet on opening the bodies of pregnant animals, the foetus is constantly found coiled on itself, and in a state of immobility as it were. Several eminent physiologists have found the muscles of the chick less irritable when in the shell than after it is hatched, either under the influ-OF animal liff.. 383 ence of common agents, or that of galvanism. I have repeated the same experiments on small guinea-pigs before they were born, by irritating directly the muscles, or exciting their nerves, spi- nal marrow, and brain. The nearer we are to the moment of conception, the less are the mo- tions produced. A very remarkable peculiarity, is the rapidity with which the moment the foetus is dead, the muscles lose their irritability. At the same instant in which life is extinguished, this pro- perty is annihilated. In the last days previous to delivery it is rather more permanent and more readily I flight into play, but still less so than after birW, and it cannot then be doubted that the motions though existing are less at that age. We shall find that in the adult, the nutrition, the volume, and colour of the muscles, are in general proportionate with the number of motions they are intended to perform ; we ought not then to be surprized if they are penetrated with less blood in the foetus; besides, the nearer we ap- proach the instant of conception, the less abun- dant is the fluid. I have had occasion to make this remark on guinea-pigs killed at different pe- riods of breeding. At first the muscles of the young are in reality similar to those of frogs, whitish like these, they are over-run with small reddish lines which trace the course of the vessels. I presume also, the species of blood circulatedMUSCULAR SYSTEM 384 in their arteries at that stage of life, and which penetrates their muscles, is not so very fit to pro- duce and maintain motion. In fact, at that stage, it is the dark blood that reaches their muscles through the vessels. Now we know that in the adult, every time this species of blood is acci- dentally circulated in the arterial system, life is endangered, the muscular motion weakened, and asphyxia soon ensues. To the nature and colour of the blood in the foetus, must be attributed the livid, and frequently the dark hue, displayed by the muscles; for this is another character that distinguishes them from those in the aes It, they are not only paler, but their colour is Tjuite dif- ferent ; and before the foetus has breathed, have always the character I have pointed out. In the foetus the muscles are thin, and but slightly prominent : they are much less deve- loped than those of organic life. The size of the extremities proceeds from their sub-cutaneous fat : when this fat is not very abundant, and the ex- tremities are compared with the trunk, they are much less in proportion to this than they will be in the progress of time. In foetuses that are pos- sessed of abundance of cutaneous fact, when all the skin is removed this disproportion of bulk is likewise observed. We are aware, that at that \ * stage of life every cavity for muscular insertion, every apophysis intended for the same use, is hardly in existence. The parieties of the temporalOF ANIMAL LIFE. 385 foss for instance, being less deep, increase the cerebral cavity, and reduces that filled up by the crotaphyte. This is a trifling anatomical fact, which is owing to an important law of nutrition, namely, the predominance in the developement of the nervous system, to which the brain belongs over the muscular system of animal life. Let us remark that this predominance, from which arises at that age an evident disproportion be- tween the two muscular and nervous systems compared to what they will become in progress of time, would alone be sufficient to prove, as has been stated, that muscles are not a termi- nation or an expansion of the nerves. In fact, two species of organs, whose developement is quite the reverse, could not possibly belong to the same system. Several authors have maintained that the fleshy mass is proportionally much more developed in the foetus than the tendon, that the latter even is wanting. I cannot conceive whence such an opinion could arise. That the aponeuroses of the extremities may in the early months have been thought deficient may be conceived. I have, in fact, constantly observed, that at that epoch they do not actually display that whitish appearance by which they are subsequently characterized, and which is assumed only when their fibres are de- veloping ; they are transparent like a serous mem- VOL. II, C c386 MUSCULAR SYSTEM brane, and may at first escape our notice. But tendons have a very evident whitish aspect; they are easily distinguished, and are proportionally as thick and long at a more advanced period. SECTION II. State of the Muscular System during Growth. At birth, the muscular system of animal life, like every other system, undergoes a remarkable revolution : the dark blood having hitherto only penetrated into its arteries, instantly the red is circulated; for^this last* fluid is formed the mo- ment respiration begins. The livid hue of the skin is evidently and almost instantly replaced by a rosy colour proceeding solely from this differ- ence in the blood. This new kind of fluid reach- ing the muscles is a new cause of excitement, and therefore of motion. To this may be added the sudden increase of cerebral action. Hitherto permeated with black blood only, the brain was left in a state of inactivity, owing chiefly, as I have proved elsewhere, to the absence of sensa- tion. Suddenly the red blood reaches and sti- mulates this organ, either by the principles it contains, or merely because it is different from that circulated before; for it is the nature of sensibility to be affected in any organ whatever,387 OF ANIMAL LIFE. by a change of stimulants. Excited by the red blood, the brain immediately re-acts upon the muscles, and compels them to contract. This cause added to the preceding, appears to me to be amongst others, that which produces the sud- den transition from the apathy of the foetus, or at least from its deficiency of motions to the general agitation of all its limbs* of its abdo- men, chest, face, &c.; for instantly after birth, nearly all his muscles move with more or less energy. Let us be careful, however, not to exaggerate the influence of a cause which undoubtedly is not the only one; the motions of the diaphragm, and of the pectoral muscles, for instance, are evi- dently antecedent to the red blood reaching the brain, since their action is indispensable for the production of this red blood. These muscles be- gin to act, because the contact of air to the whole of the body, and to the mucous surfaces, stimu- lates the brain, which is the centre of all sensa« tion. Influenced by this cause, the brain re-acts upon the muscles, and disposes them to contract. The contractions increase, when to this exterior and indirect excitation is added the interior and direct excitation we have just mentioned. This second state is not indispensably necessary to the foetus ; for infants are often seen to conti- nue livid, and to move perfectly, some time afte c c 2388 MUSCULAR SYSTEM birth; but in general, the motions are not so striking as when the florid colour of the skin shows that the arterial blood is subjected to the influence of respiration. The circulation of the red blood in muscles does not immediately impart to them that colour of which they are subsequently possessed ; for some time after birth they still display a dark tint, evidently proved by dissections, because, as I have said before, their colour does not proceed from the colouring matter circulating in their tissue, but actually from that combined with the tissue itself. Now nutrition alone produces the combination ; but this function operates by de- grees only; it is actually a chronic function, when compared with exhalation, absorption, and circulation, which evidently assume an acute type. Asjige advances, the muscles gradually assume a deeper colour, they are permeated with more blood, and are more abundantly nourished than many other organs. This is particularly remarka- ble in those of the inferior extremities. I have remarked, however, that as long as growth is continued, it acts upon the length and not on the thickness of the muscles. This explains why they are not so conspicuous through the inte- guments, why the forms are fuller and more graceful, but less manly, at that stage of life. The389 OF ANIMAL LIFE. exterior habit, with the exception of all such causes as might influence conformation, is in this respect quite different in a youth from that of an adult. The exterior conformation of an infant and a young man, is in general very analogous with that of the female. Although we are not so perfectly acquainted with the difference of substances that penetrate the muscles in infants and the adult, as with those of the bones, where the addition of the calcareous phosphate to the gelatine presents such a striking phenomenon in respect to nutrition, yet it cannot be doubted that these differences most inevitably exist. Submitted to ebullition, combustion, ma- ceration, &c. the flesh of the foetus doesnot yield the same results as that of the adult. Broth made from the muscles of a young ani- mal contains much more gelatine, a substance that predominates so much at that stage of life, and has much less flavour than that from adult animals, and consequently there appears to be less extractive substance in the muscular system. Veal broth is characterized by a flat taste, which is disagreeable even to some persons. The differ- ence of the principles it contains influences even the gastric organs, which they cause to contract; they open the body, as it is called, a phenome- non never produced by other broths. It does not appear that iibrine is over abundant in muscles atMUSCULAR SYSTEM 390 that stage of life, as I am induced to believe by the following considerations: 1st. Instead of this substance, Fourcroy found nothing but a softish tissue in the blood of the foetus, without the least consistence, and gelati- nous as it were. Now the blood seems to be the reservoir for fibrine ; 2dly. The power and energy of contractions are generally proportionate with the quantity of this principle in the muscles. Now this energy is very deficient in the early age; 3dly. These muscles do not twist and con- tract so much on burning as those of the adult. In two or three different instances, I have ob- served that their tissue, on being applied to burn- ing coals, swelled in the same manner as gelatine subjected to the same experiment. In general it appears that this last substance is substituted in muscles to the fibrous substance that is formed afterwards. Those who attend dissecting- rooms, have undoubtedly observed, that under similar circumstances the muscles of young sub- jects are longer in putrefying than the greatest part of other substances, and that in this process they emit a less offensive smell. We are aware that veal broth becomes sour much quicker than that of beef. It is always white, and has never that dark colour observed in the others. It stiffens much quicker and boils much sooner, either by the naked fire or by any fluid. The juice ex-OF ANIMAL LIFE. 391 pressed from the muscles is essentially different, it is not so strong. The effects of maceration also are much more rapid ; that mucous pulp, to which every animal substance is finally brought by the action of water, is much sooner obtained. SECTION III. State of the Muscular System subsequent to Growth. After general growth in statue is completed, our organs still increase in bulk ; in muscles this phenomenon is very remarkable. To the slender, thin, and rounded forms of adolescence and youth, strong, powerful, and manly forms succeed, the muscles may be traced through the integuments, on which alternate projections and depressions are observed. At that stage of life the muscular system appears to more advantage during rest, than in the most considerable motions of the youth. Painters and sculptors have paid more attention than anatomists to the developement of the muscles. The period at which hair begins to increase, and the organs of generation become active, is, principally that in which the muscles begin to become prominent in man. This last period is not attended in the female with a similar phenomenon; the muscles retain their primitive contour ; the graceful and rounded forms in theMUSCULAR SYSTEM 392 fair sex, form a contrast with the kind of harsh- ness in those of man. The increase in the bulk of the muscles ap- pears to operate much more on the fleshy than upon the tendinous and aponeurotic parts. The intermuscular aponeuroses in particular do not appear to grow in proportion to the1 fibres that are affixed to them, so that these form a projection, and in the part of the aponeuroses there is a depression which is better observed in muscles crossed in their insertions by a quantity of fibrous substance, in the deltoid in particular. The projection of the whole muscle under the skin not only shows more clearly the depressions which se- parate them from each other, but also each fleshy layer forms a prominence separated by a groove, which, however, is distinct in rather lean subjects only. In proportion as the muscle increases in thick- ness, it acquires^more density, it becomes firmer, and more resistant; if the hand, for comparison’s sake, be placed on two similar muscles of an adult, and of an infant, whilst they are con- tracted, a remarkable difference in the hardness is observed. If weights be suspended to muscles proceeding from two subjects belonging to these stages of life, they will prove the different de- grees of their resistance. The muscular tissue of an adult will resist all kind of re-agents much longer.393 OF ANIMAL LIFE. The colour of the muscle continues red in the adult; but in general, an allowance being made in respect to the causes that may effect a change in that hue, it rather begins to fade away after the age of thirty. In the last years of growth, and even from the age of ten to that of twenty, this hue is in general the brightest, the most glaring. In the adult it displays a very remarkable phe- nomenon. The muscles in every man are red, but the shade is scarcely even the same in diffe- rent individuals. Those who have attended dis- sections may have ascertained this truth. This hue may be influenced by a multiplicity of causes ; the temperament is the most essential. Diseases also form a number of varieties; all these which assume a chronic type will produce a remarkable alteration; it then fades and becomes tarnished, &c. When dropsies have lasted some time, it turns white. Every thing in general that has a gradual and depressing influence over the vital powers affects this hue. Acute diseases, whatever they may be, will hardly influence it. Fevers characterized by great prostration, will leave it uninjured if they terminate in death, be- cause this hue can only be affected by the process of nutrition. Now as this function is slow in deve- loping, its phenomena are but indifferently af- fected by acute diseases; it is only after a394 MUSCULAR SYSTEM long time that this colour is influenced by gene- ral disease. I have remarked that the varieties of shades observed in the muscles of adult subjects, even in the perfect state, especially distinguishes these organs from those of the foetus, which in general are uniformly made. This difference proceeds from our not being exposed in the early age to the action of a multiplicity of agents, which in the subsequent stages of life modify ad infinitum the essential functions, and consequently the nu- tritive process. It is in these varieties of shades in the hue of the muscular system of the adult, that we find the blood circulated bv the arteries has positively nothing to do with it: this fluid in fact, is uniform in respect to colour, and not liable to change. A multiplicity of circumstances in the adult will cause a difference of muscular contraction: motion is the most essential. The sedentary man is remarkable for the flaccidity of his muscles, particularly if they be compared with those of every active man. This phenomenon is not only displayed in the general habit, but also in parti- cular parts, the arm of the baker, the calves of the dancer, the shoulders of the porter, &c. establish this fact.395 OF ANIMAL LIFE. SECTION IV. State of the Muscular System in old Age. In old age the tissue of the muscles undergoes astonishing changes, it grows resistant and tough, and the tooth tears it with difficulty. This excess of density checks its contractions, which can no longer be performed with rapidity, for the-action of the brain upon the muscles is impaired ; motion cannot be continued so long, it is sooner followed by weariness. It should be observed, the density of the muscles must not be confounded with their cohesion. It proceeds from the integral sub- stances of the muscle: cohesion on the contrary, appears to be connected with the vital influence, the effect of which survives death. If the mus- cles of a robust and powerful adult be dissected, the fleshy mass will be found firm, it preserves its station by its own power, although separated by the knife from all the surrounding tissue. In the body of one who has sunk under a chronic disease on the contrary, in a dropsical or con- sumptive subject, &c. for instance, the muscles are slack, and afford no support; the connections are lost the instant the surrounding tissue is re- moved ; inasmuch as the former are proper sub- jects for the dissection of muscles, so much are these unfit for it. In aged subjects the muscular396 MUSCULAR SYSTEM tissue is nearly the same as in the latter, flabby and loose ; this flaccidity is felt under the skin ; in the soleus, the gastrocnemii, the biceps, &c. it does not prevent each fibre from being dense, tough, &c. Muscular cohesion in general is in a reverse sense to the age. The muscles of the youth are firm and tight; they do not move un- der the skin. Towards the fortieth year more laxity begins to be observed, and beyond that period in the great motions the calves of the legs begin to quiver ; the thighs, and in general all the prominent parts, display also this state of flaccidity, especially if the subject be lean. The muscles also become less capable of motion in proportion as we approach old age, a period in which the least motion causes a tremor of the whole muscular system, the muscles are no longer sufficiently contracted, they are too long, as it were, for the space they fill. This appears to proceed from the contracti- lity of the tissue being reduced in the last stage of life. We may easily be convinced of it, by comparing a muscle divided transversely in a young or in an ’aged subject; in the former, in fact, it contracts more than in the latter subject. By this contractility of the tissue, all the parti- cles of the muscle are drawn closer together during repose ; but this effect is no longer pro- duced ; the organ remains flaccid. Authors have not paid sufficient attention to that remarkable Why is this ? BecauseOF ANIMAL LIFE. S97 phenomenon displayed by the muscular system in the progress of age, a phenomenon that ac- tually indicates the degree of contractile power. In old age the muscular tissue frequently dis- plays such an alteration, that for its natural hue a pale yellow and a greasy appearance are sub- stituted, although this aspect does not proceed from the fat, but from a total deficiency of the colouring matter of the blood : I have repeatedly made this remark. If the fat that envelopes these pretended greasy muscles be carefully removed, so that their tissue only is left, no animal oil will be extracted by combustion or ebullition ; they are found in their ordinary fibrous state, the colour only is different. I have observed that the deep muscles of the back, those situate in the vertebral notches, are much more liable than the rest to lose their colour and assume this yellow aspect, an aspect that never pervades the whole system, being found only in a few isolated muscles. Sub- jects of a middle age, as well as those advanced in years, are liable, though less frequently, to this alteration. A similar appearance has been ob- served in emaciated limbs; in cases of recent pa- ralysis, even in such as have lasted three, four, and six months, the muscles retain their colour and volume, but after a long space of .time, the absence of motion, and perhaps the deficiency of nervous influence, will eventually impair the H Pvocess °f nutrition, which has continued a long398 MUSCULAR SYSTEM time perfect without this influence ; and then the muscles fade, contract, and decrease. But even this phenomenon is not permanent: in the Hotel- Dieu there are cases of hemiplegia that have lasted six, seven, and even ten years, without the least difference in the nutrition of the affected and the sound limb. Long continued external pres- sure upon a muscle will produce nearly the same effect as an atrophy; it robs it of its hue, and whitens it by checking circulation. In those who habitually use straps passed under their arms, who constantly wear girdles round the abdomen, who lift burdens, the muscles corresponding to the seat of pressure, are frequently in the same state as those of the aged subject. I have remarked, however, that these muscles contract, which evidently proves that the colouring substance is not absolutely indispensable for muscular action. The blood in general flows in less quantity to the muscles of the aged subject, their vessels are partly obliterated ; a cause that exposes them to the state I have just mentioned. section v. State of the Muscular System at Death. At the instant of death the muscles are left in two different states; sometimes they are still and inflexible, at other times they suffer the399 OF ANIMAL LIFE. * limbs to perform rather easy motions. To bend the thigh in a corpse often requires considerable exertion ; but sometimes the slightest attempt is sufficient, as in cases of asphyxia from charcoal. These states of rigidity or relaxation are innume- rable in their degrees. The first is sometimes car- ried so far, that the subject, on being placed against the wall will remain in a vertical direc- tion, on other occasions this cannot possibly be effected. In some subjects, one division of the muscular system is stiff, another is slack. It ap- pears that these different states depend upon the nature of the death, upon the phenomena that accompany the last respirations. How these phe- nomena are produced would be a very inte- resting subject of research. I have remarked that the muscles which remain stiff at the instant of death, are easily lacerated, if ever so slight an effort be made to bend the limbs to which they resort; that the contrary is the case with those which continue supple, whatever may be the de- gree of force directed to their moveable points; to produce this phenomenon, which is then easily effected, they should be drawn in a straight direction, or weights should be suspended to them. The muscular tissue, as is the case with the bony, the cartilaginous, and even with the fibrous, is never accidentally developed in partsMUSCULAR SYSTEM, &C. 400 wherein it did not originally exist. If this de- velopement were to occur, it would not belong to animal but to organic life ; to be connected with the former, the cerebral nerves are indis- pensably requisite, the muscles being no more than the agents of motion which these nerves commu- nicate.MUSCULAR SYSTEM OF ORGANIC LIFE. This system is not so liberally extended throughout the economy as the preceding. The whole, when compared with that of the latter, which forms more than one third of the body, offers, in this respect, a very remarkable diffe- rence. Its position is also different; it is con- centrated ; 1st. In the chest, where the heart and the oesophagus belong to it; 2dly. In the abdomen; the stomach and the intestines be- ing partly formed by it; 3dly. In the pelvis, where it contributes to form the bladder, and even the womb, although the latter belongs to generation, which is a distinct function of organic life. This system then occupies the centre of the trunk, does not interfere with the limbs, and is secured from exterior injury; while the other placed superficially, forming almost entirely the limbs, appears, as we have before stated, to be intended in the trunk to protect the other or- gans, as much as to perform the various motions VOL. II. B DMUSCULAR SYSTEM 402 of the animal. The head contains no division whatever of the organic muscular system; this region of the body is exclusively intended for the organs of animal life. ARTICLE I. Forms of the Muscular System of Organic Life. Every muscle of the preceding system follows in general a straight direction. All of these, on the contrary, folded and curved, form a kind of muscular bag differently shaped ; sometimes cy- lindrical, as in the intestines, at other times coni- cal, as in the heart, or spherical, as in the bladder. Sometimes their form is irregular, as in the stomach for instance. None of them adhere to the bones, and in all tendinous fibres are wanting. The white fibres arising from the interior surface of the heart, and inserted into the valves of its ven- tricles, are by no means of the same nature as tendons are: they are not easily diffused into gelatine by ebullition ; in drying they do not as- sume the yellowish aspect displayed by these or- gans, and they resist for a long time the process of maceration. Not to originate from fibrous organs; not to terminate in them, is in general an important character that distinguishes the organic muscularOF ORGANIC MFC. 403 system from that of animal life. In the latter, all the fibres are continued either with tendons, with aponeuroses, or with fibrous membranes ; nearly all those of the first originate in the cellular tissue and return to it again, after having completed' their course. At first I believed that the dense and tight layer interposed between the mucous membrane and the fleshy fibres of the intestines, of the bladder, of the stomach, &c. was an assemblage and an interlacement of a multiplicity of minute tendons corresponding to these fibres, and woven in the form of an aponeu- rosis ; at first sight I was deceived by the density of this layer. By ebullition, maceration, and desic- cation, I have since ascertained that it is com- pletely unconnected with the fibrous system : this layer, as Haller has stated, should be referred to the cellular tissue, which in this part is denser and tighter than in any other. This is the layer I have described in the cellular system, under the name of sub-mucous tissue. Several fibres of the system we are now considering, appear to form a complete curve, without any cellular intersec- tion whatever. Some plans of the heart thus disposed, exhibit this structure, which in general is very rare, so that the fibres originate from and terminate in an organ, of a distinct nature from their own. The forms of this system cannot be considered in a general point of view ; everv organ that be- D D 9j404 MUSCULAR SYSTEM longs to it moulds itself upon the form of the viscus it contributes to form. The organic mus- cles, in fact, are not formed in isolated skains, like those of animal life. None except the heart contribute more than a third, a quarter, and even less, in the formation of a viscus. The greatest part are of a thin, flat, and mem- branous form ; they are in layers of divers widths, and hardly ever in distinct bundles. Si- tuate next to each other, the fibres are not often placed above : hence it follows, that these mus- cles being of a very considerable extent, are still not very voluminous. The gluteus major alone would be more considerable than all the fibres of the stomach, intestines, and the bladder, if, like this, they were united into a thick and square mass. ARTICLE II. Organization of the Muscular System of Organic Life. The organization of the involuntary muscles is not quite so uniform as that of the preceding. Allowing for the distinctions observed in these, for the proportion of the fleshy fibres over the tendinous, the length of the first, for the thick- ness of their bundles, and for their assemblage in flat, long, and short muscles, every thing is per-OF ORGANIC LIFE. 405 fectly similar. It matters not in what part they are examined, their varieties relate to the forms and not the texture. Here, on the contrary, the distinctions of texture are obvious ; the heart compared with the stomach, the intestines with the bladder, are striking1 examples. It is in vir- tue of these differences of the texture, that con- tractility and sensibility vary, as we shall see in each muscle, that the power of contraction is not the same—that life is different in each, whilst it is uniform in those of animal life. We shall, however, consider the organization of the invo- juntary muscles in a general point of view. SECTION i. Tissue proper to the Organization of the Muscular System of Organic Life. The muscular fibres of organic life are, in ge- neral, much finer than those of the preceding sys- tem ; nor are they united in such large masses. Of a deep red in the heart, they are found whi- tish in the gastric and urinary organs. This hue besides varies in an astonishing degree. I have sometimes observed those of the intestines acquire a very deep brown by maceration. These fibres are never found, like the preced- ing, to assume only one direction : they are con- stantly intermixed, or are laid in juxta-position, in different ways. Sometimes they form rectan-406 MUSCULAR SYSTEM gles in the skains, as the longitudinal and circular fibres in the gastric tubes; at other times, as in the stomach, bladder, &c. they form angles more or less acute. In the heart this interweav- ing is such, as to form in the ventricles a com- plete muscular net. From these various direc- tions there results real advantage for the motions of these kind of organs, which, being hollow, may lessen, by contracting into various diameters the extent of their cavity. All the organic muscular fibres are generally rather short; those which like the longitudinal ones of the oesophagus, of the rectum, &c. seem to run a considerable distance, and are not conti- nuous ; they originate and terminate in a short space, to arise and terminate again in the same line : in respect to length, none can be compared with those of the sartorius, of the gracilis, &c. We are not better acquainted with their nature than with that of the fibres of animal life ; they act besides nearly the same when submitted to the divers re-agents. The very same phenomena are produced by desiccation, putrefaction, maceration, and ebullition. I have remarked, in respect to the latter, that after having undergone ebullition, the fibres of both systems are not so readily af- fected by acids sufficiently diluted. After having remained for some length of time in the sulphu- ric, the muriatic, and the nitric acids, diluted with water, they become somewhat softer, but retain407 OF ORGANIC LIFU. their primitive form, and are not diffused into that pulpous state to which raw fibres are brought by similar experiments. The last-mentioned acid will dye them yellow as previous to ebullition. In respect to the shrinking produced the mo- ment ebullition begins,—I have remarked that it is invariably the same, whatever may be the ante- rior dilatation or contraction of the fibres. The stomach left sufficiently dilated at death to con- tain several pints of liquid, will contract to the same volume, (ceteres paribus,) so as not to ex- ceed the size of the ccecum. Diseases have some influence upon this contraction. The heart of a consumptive subject, in the very same experiment, did not so evidently display this phenomenon, as that of one who had died from apoplexy. The resistance offered by the organic muscular fibres is proportionally more considerable than that of the fibres in the muscular system of ani- mal life. To whatever degree the extension of the hollow fibres is carried during life by the fluids they are filled with, they are rarely lacerated. The bladder alone may sometimes, but very rare- ly, present this phenomenon. In considerable re- tentions of urine, when laceration ensues, they most generally occur in the urethra, the bladder remaining uninjured. In practice, a hundred ul- cers in the perineum, proceeding from the mem- branous portion, will be observed, to one above the pubis. Authors relate numerous instances of408 MUSCULAR SYSTEM lacerations of the diaphragm, but hardly one of the stomach, the intestines, and the heart, are mentioned. SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Muscular System of Organic Life. The cellular tissue is, when generally consi- dered, more sparingly distributed in the muscles of organic life than in the others. The fibres of the heart are much more in juxta-position than united by that tissue ; it is rather more apparent in the gastric and urinary muscles: scarcely any is met with in the womb; hence these muscles are never, like the preceding, infiltrated in drop- sies ; they never display that greasy state we have mentioned, in which the fibres are, as it were, imbedded ; nor have I ever remarked in these muscles, that yellowish hue frequently ob- served in the other fibres, particularly in those of the vertebral notches. The blood-vessels are much more numerous in this system, and even proportionally than in the others ; consequently they are supplied with a greater quantity of blood. This fact is parti- cularly remarkable in the intestines, where the mesenteric arteries supply a remarkable thin layer with a profusion of ramusculae: but I ob-409 OF ORGANIC LIFE. serve this appearance is to a certain degree illu- sory, inasmuch as these vessels merely cross the fleshy fibres on their progress to the mucous membrane. In the natural state they impart to the gastric viscera a pinkish hue, which may be made livid or restored to its primitive state, by turning the cock I adapt to the trachea in my ex- periments on asphyxia. The absorbents and exhalents have nothing particular in these muscles. They receive their nerves from two sources; 1st. From the cerebral system ; 2dly. From that of the ganglions. The nerves projected by the ganglions predo- minate every where, except in the stomach, to which organ the par-vagum is extended. They are the most essential ones in the heart; in the intestines they are exclusive; at the extremity of the rectum, and of the bladder, they are more numerous than those proceeding from the spine. The cerebral nerves intermix with these on plunging into the organic muscles. The cardiac, solar, and epigastric plexuses, result from this in- terlacement, which apparently influences the mo- tions, although we are unacquainted with the na- ture of this influence. Every nerve proceeding from ganglious, and that plunges into the organic muscles, does not seem exclusively intended for them ; a consider- able number of filaments belong to the arteries ; such is, in fact, the interlacement they form,MUSCULAR SYSTEM 410 that we have seen, round these vessels, a real ner- vous membrane superadded to their own, and exclusively intended for them. I compare this nervous sheath with the cellular envelopement of the arteries, which is perfectly distinct from the adjacent cellular tissue ; hence this has nothing more than communications with the nerves of the organic muscles, without being otherways dis- tributed to these muscles; besides, as the nerves of the ganglions are constantly the most essential and the most numerous, they are excessively fine, the nervous mass intended for each is much inferior to that in the voluntary muscles. The heart and the deltoid muscle, on being compared together, display in this respect a very remarkable difference. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Muscular System of y Organic Life. In respect to its properties, this system is partly similar to the preceding, and in part distinct from it. SECTION i. Properties of the Tissue—Extensibility. In the muscles of organic life extensibility is very conspicuous. The dilatation of the intestinesOF ORGANIC LIFE. '411 ft and that of the stomach, by the food, by the gases emitted in these organs, by the fluids they may contain, that of the bladder by urine, by the fluids injected, &c. are essentially derived from this extensibility. This property is herein essentially characterized by two remarkable properties ; 1st. By the rapi- dity with which it can be brought into play; 2dly. By the very considerable extent it admits of. The stomach and the intestines pass in a mo- ment from a complete state of vacuity to a very considerable extension. Artificially distended, the bladder will admit of being distended to three or four times its usual size. Sometimes, however, it will resist, but this does not prove a want of ex- tensibility ; it proceeds from its being irritated by the fluid which causes it to contract; organic contractility in exercise prevents extension, as it sometimes cannot be brought to act by the irri- tation directed upon a muscle laid bare in a living animal, because the animal * contractility being fully excited in this muscle forms an obstacle to it. The muscles of animal life will never admit of such rapid extension, either because they are crossed by numerous aponeuroses, which dilate but slowly, or because their layers of fibres are too thick, two circumstances foreign to the mus- cles of organic life; hence a remarkable pheno- menon I have instanced in every case of tympa- nites. When the abdomen of subjects who have412 MUSCULAR SYSTEM died of this disease is laid open without dividing the bloated intestines, these instantly swell still more, and require double the space to what they had occupied in the abdomen. Why is this? Because the parieties of the abdomen not calcu- lated to yield proportionally to the quantities of gas that has been produced, these have, during life, been compressed in the intestines, and in- stantly expand in virtue of their contractility when the cause of compression is removed. Dis- tention being slowly produced in dropsies, the ab- dominal parieties yield much more than in tym- panites. In this disease the volume of the abdo- men would be double to the other, if the exten- sibility of its parieties were proportionate with that of the intestines. We may form some idea of the extensibility of the organic muscles, by comparing an empty sto- mach, which is frequently not larger than the coecum in its natural state, with the same organ containing five, six, and even eight pints of fluid ; the bladder contracted on itself, and hid behind the pubes, with one filled with urine rising in some cases of retention above the umbilicus ; the rectum empty, with that in which, with aged subjects, the faeces have been accumulating and filling a part of the pelvis, the intestines contracted with those inflated with gas. To the great extensibility of the organic mus- cles, and to the limited degree of this property inOF ORGANIC LIFE. 413 those of the abdominal parieties, must be referred a phenomenon constantly observed in respect to the gastric viscera; namely, that in the natural series of their functions they are never all dis- tended at the same time ; the intestines fill when the stomach has voided the matter it contained; the bladder in the order of digestion is filled with urine, when the other hollow organs are empty, &c. In general, it is against the order of nature for all the organs to be distended at the same time. The organic muscles possess also a mode of extensibility quite different from what I have just mentioned; it is that of the heart in aneu- risms, that of the womb in pregnancy. The left side of the former, for instance, acquires twice, sometimes even thrice its natural volume, and yet it continues to increase in thickness. This increase is not owing to a distention; but actually to unnatural growth. The heart affected with aneurism, is to the natural one what an adult’s is to that of a child ; the difference is owing to nu- trition and not to distention ; for when this is the case, it loses in thickness what it acquires in ex- tent, there being no additional substance : besides, the heart affected with aneurism has frequently no cause of distention, for generally in these cases the mitral valves leave a free passage to the blood, whilst when they are ossified, the left part often remains in the natural state. The slow formation of aneurism also sufficiently shows that414 MUSCULAR SYSTEM the process of nutrition is preeternaturally in- creased. To empty the heart of the contained blood would be useless ; it would not contract, nor return to its original dimensions in the same manner as the inflated intestine will, on being punctured to let out the air. In the womb there are two causes of disten- tion; 1st. The sinuses largely developed, and containing a quantity of blood; 2dly. An addi- tion of substance, a real temporary increase of the fibres of the organ, which remain as thick, and even more so, than in the natural state. At the moment of delivery the sinuses are lessened in size from the contraction of the fibres : hence the spontaneous contraction of the organ. But as on one part the substances superadded to the febres can be removed by the decomposition which takes place in the nutritive process, and on the other part, this function is slowly affected, after the womb has undergone the sudden con- traction, owing to the depression of the sinuses, it is only gradually, and with time that it re-as- sumes its natural state. The womb filled with the foetus, and the heart affected with aneu- rism, are not in a state of distention: in such cases these organs actually become the focus of more active nutrition ; they grow accidentally in the same manner as they grew naturally with the other organs, except that they become compara- tively monstrous. After delivery the womb de-415 OF ORGANIC LIFE. creases, because at that time the motion of de- composition naturally predominates over that of composition, which previously, was quite the re- verse. The aneurismal heart always remains the same. Now is the time to distinguish properly those enlargements produced by extensibility ; as those of the right auricle and ventricles for instance, which are filled with blood at the moment of death, because the lungs being weakened, and not admitting a free circulation of this fluid, it is repelled towards its source. Th^re are few hearts indeed that do not present these dilatations in very variable degrees, which may be increased or lessened at will, according to the nature of the death. In the dissecting room two hearts are rarely found alike ; a number of varieties are met with, and these varieties are derived from the degree of obstruction to the blood during the last moments in crossing the lungs. This explains why, in the affections of the heart, we have no criterion by which every morbid increase might be compared, (particularly if the organ be examined as a whole. In fact, the distention of the right part may give it an aneurismal appearance, and a volume superior even to that of certain aneurisms. If the left part be considered in an isolated manner, the error in this disease is the better ascertained, because this part admits of less variations. But the essential difference is in the thickness ; the energy of con-MUSCULAR SYSTEM 416 traction seems to increase with the thickness, arising from a superabundance of substance sup- plied by nutrition. It is this energy that produces these strong pulsations felt upon the ribs, the force of the pulse, &c. Contractility. This is proportionate with extensibility, and is frequently brought into action in the natural state. It is in virtue of this power that the stomach, the bladder, the intestines, &c. shrink, contract, and are reduced to so small a compass when com- pared to that in a state of plenitude. There is not one muscle in animal life that will admit, like those of organic, of that immense dispropor- tion between their two most distant states. It may be remarked that life, without having contractility under its immediate dependence, since the intestines, the stomach, and the bladder, will contract after death, when the cause of their distentions has been removed, will modify it, how- ever, in a very striking degree. The causes even which alter or reduce the vital powers act upon them; hence the following observation, with which those who follow the courses of dissections may have been struck with. Whenever death has been sudden, and the stomach is empty, it is very much contracted; but when, on the contrary death is the result of a long disease which has reduced the powers, the stomach, although empty, is left flabby, and is but slightly contracted.OF ORGANIC LIFE. 417 The substances contained within the hollow muscles of organic life should be considered as their real antagonists, for they are not opposed by muscles acting in a reverse direction. As long as they are distended by these substances their contractility is counteracted, but as soon as they are emptied it comes into play. It is not upon this property, however, that the mechanism of the ex- pulsion of the matter from these organs, such as food from the stomach and the intestines, urine from the bladder, blood from the heart, &c. re- volves; organic contractility presides over ib These two properties are easily distinguished dur- ing action, for the one causes a slow and gradual contraction without any alternate relaxation ; the other quick, abrupt, consisting in a continuation of contractions and relaxations, constitutes the systole and diastole, &c. After organic contrac- tility has evacuated the hollow muscles, they are again contracted by the contractility of the tissue. In deaths caused by hemorrhage from a large artery, the right side of the heart, and even the left, expel all the blood they contained ; being left empty, they contract forcibly, and the organ remains very small. On the contrary, it is very large when distended by the considerable quantity of blood left in its ca- vities, as in cases of asphyxia for instance. Such are the two extremes, between which there are, as I have before stated, a multiplicity of intermediate vol. u. E E418 MUSCULAR SYSTEM links, the contractility of the tissue being in this system proportionate with the number of fleshy fibres. Thus, ceteris paribus, the rectum being empty, contracts with more power than the large intestines; the contraction of the ventricles is much greater to that of the auricles than of the oesophagus, exceeds the contraction of the duo- denum, &c. &c. SECTION II. Vital Properties. These are nearly in a reverse order to those of the preceding system. Properties of Animal Life.—Sensibility. Animal sensibility is rather obscure in the or- ganic muscles. The observation made by Harvey, of a caries of the sternum which had left the heart bare, is well known ; that organ was irritated al" most without the patient being conscious of it, and merely contracted under the irritation. If we remove the peritoneum from behind the bladder of a living dog, and the subjacent muscular layer be irritated, the animal will scarcely give any signs of pain. It would be difficult to try these experiments on the intestines and the stomach; their muscular layer is so very thin, it would be419 OF ORGANfC LIFE. impossible to act upon them without interfering at the same time with the subjacent nerves. It appears that the organic muscles are less lia- ble to those sensations of weariness of which the others are susceptible after considerable exercise. I could not affirm, however, that it is not the case with such as receive many of the cerebral nerves ; for instance, when the stomach has been long contracted, it is highly probable that the weariness of its muscular fibres give rise to the sensation we then experience, and which is called hunger; a sensation that should be distinguished from the general affection by which it is suc- ceeded, forming in reality a disease when absti- nence has been too long continued. We are aware that substances void of nutrition will ap- pease this sensation without curing the disease. To the same mode of sensibility must be referred the anxiety and uneasiness of those in whom the bladder is kept in a state of constant irritation, by the presence of a hollow sound in the urethra, transmitting the urine as it flows from the ureters. This sensation does not resemble that of hunger, because the sensibility of the bladder and that of the stomach being different, their modifications cannot possibly be the same. Thus are each of these two sensations very different from that which was seated in the muscles of animal life when they have remained long contracted. I do e e 2MUSCULAR, SYSTEM 420 not believe the sensation of hanger is solely ow- ing to the cause I pointed out, and which has never been mentioned before, but it cannot be doubted that it is in some degree. Who can tell ; may it not be that subsequent to fevers, in which the action of the heart has been long accelerated, the weakness of the pulse during convalescence does not denote the weariness of its fleshy fibres from their previous action ? We are perfectly acquainted with the painful sensa- tion felt in the stomach subsequent to the violent contractions that organ has undergone in vo- miting. Contractility. Animal contractility has no connection with the muscles of organic life. To convince our- selves of it, we have only to recollect, that on the one hand this contractility supposes the influ- ence of the brain and of the nerves to bring the muscular action into play ; that on the other hand, the brain to exercise this influence requires / to be excited by the will, by the irritating agents, or by the sympathies. Now, none of these three causes acting upon the brain, will cause the or- ganic muscles to contract. Every one is perfectly conscious that these muscles are essentially involuntary. If it be true that some have been enabled to stop the motion of the heart, it was not upon that organ theOF ORGANIC LIFIE. 421 brain had acted; the action of the diaphragm and intercostals must have been first suspended, respiration momentarily ceased, and then the cir- culation. If the brain be irritated with the knife, or any other stimulant, the muscles of animal life be- come convulsed ; they will be paralyzed if this organ be compressed. Those of organic life, on the contrary, retain their natural motion in both cases ; the heart still continues to beat; the in- testines and the stomach move sometime after the cerebral mass and spinal marrow have been removed. Who is not aware, that in acephalous subjects circulation is perfect; that after the blow by which an animal is knocked down, and the whole power of the voluntary muscles destroyed, the heart will still continue to act some time, the bladder to expel urine, the rectum the feces, &c. In some cases even the stomach ejects its con- tents. Opium, which benumbs the whole animal life because it specially acts upon the brain, the centre of that life, and which paralyzes all the voluntary muscles, does not affect the contrac- tions of the others. Intoxication produced by wine, presents the very same phenomenon. In this state a man totters; his limbs refuse their support, and yet his heart beats with force ; his stomach rises and rejects the superfluous contents. All narcotic substances will produce the effect. same422 MUSCULAR SYSTEM If from experiments we pass to the bed-side of the patient, we find all cerebral affections per- fectly unconnected with the muscular system of organic life ; wounds in the head attended with depression, funguses of the brain, effusions of blood, pus, or serum, apoplexies, &c. bear wholly upon the voluntary muscles, the action of which they either exalt, reduce, or annul. Amidst the general confusion of animal life the organic life remains uninjured; the state of insanity, and of malignant fevers, equally prove this fact. Who is not aware that in these last cases frequently the pulse is not altered, that it is even sometimes reduced ? Head-aches are frequently attended with spas- modic vomitings; the motion of the heart is ac- celerated by cerebral inflammations, &c.; but these are sympathetic phenomena, which affect the organic muscles as well as every other sys- tem ; their course cannot be indicated, since it is attended by numerous irregularities, whilst the contraction of the muscles of animal life, from affections of the brain, is a constant and invaria- ble phenomenon, which nothing disturbs or pre- vents, because the means of communication be- tween the affected organ and the one that moves is invariably the same. If in the study of the phenomena resulting from cerebral influence upon the muscles of or- ganic life we fpllow reverse order, that is to423 OF ORGANIC LlFIi. say, if, in the affections of these muscles, we ex- amine the state of the brain, we shall find the same independence: let us consider the greatest number of vomitings, the irregular motions of the intestines that take place in diarrhoea, parti- cularly those which constitute volvulus, &c. or consider the heart during the divers agitations of fevers, during the irregular palpitations with which it is so frequently affected, &c. : in all these affections of the organic muscles we scarcely ever find any signs of cerebral affection; it re- mains calm, whilst in organic life all is in confu- sion. Cullen imagined, that in syncopy the ac- tion of the brain was first suspended, and subse- quently as a consequence, that of the heart: in most cases, however, it is precisely the reverse ; the heart being first affected ceases to act. Now its action being indispensable for that of the brain, either by the motion it communicates to it, / or by the red blood it propels, the functions of the latter are suddenly arrested, and animal life is at an end. This is particularly remarkable in syncopies arising from passions, in those proceeding from hemorrhage, from polypi, from copious eva- cuations, &c. For further particulars in this re- spect I shall refer to my book upon life and death. If from the influence of the brain we pass to that of the nerves, we find additional proofs of the deficiency of animal contractility in the or-424 MUSCULAR SYSTEM ganic muscles; the greatest number of these muscles receive, as we have seen, two kind of nerves, some are cerebral, the others form the ganglions. The heart, the stomach, the rectum, and the bladder, are evidently supplied with the first of these nerves ; on cutting, or by irritating in any manner whatever, the cardiac filaments of the par vagum, the heart experiences no alteration, its motion is neither accelerated nor diminished. The division of the par vagum is mortal, it is true, but after a few days only, and I much doubt if death arises from its action in such a case. The essential phenomena, as conse- quences of this division, present a considerable obstruction in the lungs, and great difficulty of respiration: circulation appears only to be sub- sequently affected. As the same nerves are extended to the stomach, the same experiment may be tried to ascertain the cerebral influence over this viscus. Nowt the division of one has generally no effect upon this organ, that of both will soon produce a remarka- ble disturbance. But this is quite distinct from the disturbance which follows when a nerve which belongs to a muscle of animal life is di- vided: the power of the muscle is in this case destroyed, whilst the stomach, on the contrary, no longer communicating with the brain by the par vagum, appealtly acquires a momentary in-OF ORGANIC LIFE. 426 crease of power, it contracts; hence the spasmo- dic vomitings continued for the few days the animal survives the experiment-—vomitings I have constantly ascertained in dogs, and already pointed out by Haller and Cruikshank. From this then it appears, that although the brain has great influence over the stomach, this influence is quite different from that it exercises over the voluntary muscles. I have remarked, however, that the irritation of the par vagum of one or both sides, will instantly cause the stomach to contract, as it happens with a voluntary mus- cle. On irritating its nerve to try this expe- riment, the abdomen of a living animal should be laid open, so as to present a fair view of the or- gan that is to contract, and then the irritation applied to the eighth pair of nerves in the region of the neck. In their connections with the brain, the bladder and the rectum seem to approach nearer to the voluntary muscles than the stomach and the heart. We are aware that a fall upon the sacrum, from which a commotion of the inferior part of the marrow arises, causes retention of urine; that the bladder becomes paralyzed in the same man- ner as the lower limbs, which then cease also to move : however, as that organ is powerfully as- sisted in its functions by the abdominal muscles, by the levatores ani, and by voluntary muscles, the retention may in a great measure be owing426 MUSCULAR SYSTEM to the loss of power in these muscles. What in- duces me to believe it, is; 1st. The irritation of the spinal marrow, which brings in motion all the voluntary muscles of the inferior limbs and of the pelvis, has no effect upon this part. I have repeatedly ascertained this fact in guinea pigs and dogs ; 2dly. On irritating>the nerves proceeding from the foramina of the sacrum to the bladder, nerves frequently found with the utmost difficulty in an animal recently killed, on account of the blood, I have seen this muscle perfectly immoveable. All these nerves, on the contrary, having been divided, the injection of an irritating fluid will cause it to contract powerfully; Sdly. In experiments on living animals, as well as in chirurgical operations, the violence of the pain, which sometimes causes spasmodic coontractions in every muscle of animal life, will frequently cause an involuntary emission of urine. Now in this case it is not the bladder that is convulsively agitated, for if this phenomenon be manifested in an experiment upon the abdominal parieties, the flow of urine instantly ceases, because, on the one hand, the muscles of these parieties will no longer act upon the intestines and press them against the bladder, and on the other hand, the levatores ani, which contract and raise that organ, have no point of resistance against which they may compress it above. In rather copious emis- sions, the bladder is placed between two re-427 OF ORGANIC LIFE. I) verse efforts, the one superior, effected by the gastric viscera being pressed by diaphragm and the abdominal muscles ; the other inferior, which is chiefly from the levatores ani contracting in an ascending direction, w hilst the opposite effort acts in the reverse one. Now both these efforts are evi- dently under the cerebral influence. I have fre- quently had opportunities of examining the blad- der, filled with urine, in a living animal, when the abdomen was laid open; but I never saw it contract sufficiently to expel this fluid. I do not contend, but that the bladder, owing to the nerves which it receives from the sacral plexuses, may be in some degree a voluntary muscle, but I say it is chiefly by collateral powers superadded to its own, and chiefly to its functions, that this organ is submitted to the will; that animal contractility has a greater share in its function than sensible organic contractility; how then does it happen that the urine is kept within this organ, or expelled from its cavity at will ? It is as follows: When the urine that drops into the bladder, has not stagnated therein long, and is in small quantity only, it is not then sufficiently stimulating to call the sensible organic contractility into action, the effort of the bladder is so weak that it cannot overcome the resistance offered by the urethra, which being contracted by the pow- ers of the tissue, must be dilated again by the428 MIJSLUL.lIt SYSTEM impulse given to the urine. To emit this fluid then, requires that the contraction of the adjacent voluntary muscles be superadded to that of the bladder ; but the slightest effort of these muscles would be sufficient to overcome the resistance of the urethra. If the quantity of urine be con- siderable, and by having remained there some time it has acquired that colour which indicates the concentration of its principles, then its irrita- tion upon the organ acts forcibly upon the sensi- ble organic contractility, the bladder contracts in spite of the animal, and the urine is ejected. In the rectum, where the faeces have not a long tube to traverse, but merely a single aperture, this aper- ture is provided with a sphincter, which is want- ing in the urethra. This sphincter, habitually con- tracted, requires to be dilated, by the impulse of the faeces: for as they have been retained but a short time onlv in the rectum, and in a small quantity only, the sensible organic contractility is not sufficiently excited to expel them, the ac- tion of the adjacent voluntary muscles is also re- quired. If this action is not commanded by the influence of the brain, the faeces remain in the in- testine ; hence we can retain them for a considera- ble time. But if their quantity be increased, or by being allowed to remain they acquire some degree of acrimony, and become irritating, then sensible organic contractility being powerfully excited, the gut is emptied in spite of the will. If theOF ORGANIC LIFE. 4 29 sphincter, which is a voluntary muscle, happens to be paralyzed, incontinence is the result, because there is no resistance opposed to the tendency of the rectum to contract, a tendency rather inef- fectual as long as this organ is filled. From all this it is evident, that although the bladder and the rectum receive cerebral nerves, these organs, however, are less influenced by the brain than might at first be supposed, and that there is between them and the voluntary muscles a very essential distinction : they do not partake of the properties of both, but might be much better assimilated to the organic muscles than to the others. I even much doubt whether we could contract them voluntarily if no collateral power were afforded from the nerves of the sa- cral plexuses. I have never seen an animal expel his faeces when the abdomen was open. From all that has hitherto been stated, we may conclude that the cerebral nerves which resort to the organic muscles possess over them an influ- ence that cannot be assimilated to that of the ce- rebral nerves upon the muscles of animal life. I have no further knowledge of the nature of this influence. Every organic muscle receives nerves from the ganglions, either the preceding, which are also penetrated by the cerebral, or the small intestines, the ccecum, the colon, &c. which are exclusively430 MUSCULAR SYSTEM supplied by them. Now on cutting, tying, or ir- ritating these nerves in any manner whatever ; on exciting the ganglions from whence they project; on destroying them with a strong concentrated acid or alkali, the muscle remains in its natural state ; its contractions are neither accelerated nor diminished. I have not been satisfied with using the com- mon agents to ascertain invariably the actual de- ficiency of the nervous influence upon the cerebral muscles; a fact consequently admitted by every judicious physiologist, in spite of the hazardous opinions of a few physicians who have applied the vague expression of nervous influence to or- gans that are by no means calculated to admit of it. I have used galvanism, and have convinced myself that this means of bringing in organic life the muscular contractions into play is almost wholly ineffectual, whilst it is the most powerful of all in animal life. I shall not repeat now my experiments on this subject; the particulars may be read in my researches upon death. From all that has been stated there, it may be concluded that we are completely unacquainted with the influence of the brain and the nerves upon the muscles; that it does not operate as upon the voluntary muscles. It must, how- ever, exist to a certain degree, since the nervesOF ORGANIC LIFE. 431 that enter into the composition of these muscles must infallibly be intended for some use ; but this use we are unacquainted with. Organic Properties. Organic sensibility is strongly characterized in the muscles we are now considering; it must exist before the sensible organic contractility can be developed; but as these two properties are never separated, as they succeed each other in their exercise, what will be afterwards stated re- specting the one may be applied to the other. Insensible organic contractility, or tone, exists in the muscular system to that degree requisite for nutrition, without any further particularity at- tending it. Sensible organic contractility is the predomi- nant property in this system, nearly all the func- tions of which rest upon this property in the same manner as all the functions of the preceding mus- cular system are derived, as it were, from animal contractility. We shall then enter into the most minute particulars in examining this essential pro- i perty, in respect to which physiology is so much a indebted to the illustrious Haller. It may be con- sidered ; 1st. In respect to the excitants ; 2dly. 1 In respect to the organs; and 3dly. To the action i of the former upon the latter.MUSCULAR SYSTEM 432 Of Sensible Organic Contractility considered in respect to the exciting Agents. The excitants are either natural or artificial. The action of the former is continued through- out life: upon these in part depend the pheno- mena of the organs; they stimulate the muscles, which without them would be immoveable; they are to these organs as it were, what pendulums are to our machines ; they give the impulsion : the latter can hardly produce any effect, but after death, or in our experiments. Natural Excitants. These are, the blood for the heart, the urine for the bladder, the food and the faeces for the gastric organs. Every organic muscle has a body which is always in contact with it, and keeps up its motions in the same manner as every animal muscle incessantly connected with the brain borrows its power of motion from that organ. The natural excitants maintain their or- gans in the same degree of motion as long as they remain the same. Every thing is alike in respect to the organs, the pulse does not vary, the diges- tive periods require the same time, the intervals that separate the excretions of urine are the same, as long as blood, chyle, or urine have undergone433 OF ORGANIC LIFE. lio changes; but as these substances are liable to innumerable varieties, the organs preserving the same mode of organic sensibility experience fre- quent changes in their motions. At the moment chyle penetrates the blood during digestion the pulse alters, because the heart is differently excited. A similar phenomenon, but which varies, is observed; 1st. In re-absorp- tions, when pus passes into the mass of the blood ; 2dly. In the injection of different fluids into the veins,—injections so frequently repeated in the last century, when experiments on transfusion were practised, which experiments I have also per- formed, but with other views, that will be pointed out; 3dly. In inflammatory diseases, wherein the blood assumes a peculiar character, still but imperfectly ascertained, and which causes the cupped appearance, &c.; 4thly. In various other affections in which the nature of that fluid is astonishingly altered; 5thly. In the passing of the arterial blood into the veinous system, I have ascertained, that by adapting on one side a curved tube to the carotid of rather a large dog, and the other end to the jugular of the opposite side, in such a manner that the blood might be con- veyed from one vessel into the other, the passage of the red blood into the veins is not mortal, as that of the dark blood in the arteries; but in ge- neral, the first moments are marked by an acce- leration in the motions of the heart. VOL. II. F F434 MUSCULAR SYSTEM The influence of the degeneration of fluids upon diseases has undoubtedly been too far exagge- rated : but it cannot be doubted that, according to the divers alterations observed in these fluids, they may act differently upon the solids that con- tain them. We are perfectly aware that in the same subject, the time required to digest the same quantity of food will vary from one day to another; that some substances are more rapidly digested than others. Now, in all these cases the organ remains the same, the fluid only varies. Accordingly as the kidnies separate urine of a more or less acrid nature, it is retained in the blad- der for a longer or shorter space of time. Some- times the aliment is so irritating, that the mo- ment it enters the stomach it is rejected. Shall I mention the effects of emetics, or of purgatives, the powers of which are so variable? We are well aware that the words, drastic purgatives, laxatives, &c. indicate different degrees in the stimulating qualities of certain substances upon the alimentary canal; degrees that should be con- dered apart from the sensibility of the organs: this, in fact, might be such, that a laxative may produce more effect than a drastic medicine. Not only the quality but the quantity of fluids contained within the organic muscles, will influ- ence the contractility ; 1st. The word plethora is undoubtedly used in too vague a manner; it can- not be doubted, however, that the state it ex-435 OF ORGANIC LIFE. presses is sometimes present. Now a greater quantity of blood being propelled to the heart, its contractions are accelerated; 2dly. I have had frequent opportunities of repeating transfu- sion upon dogs, either with a view to this pheno- menon, or those of respiration and circulation. Now I have always observed, that by not opening a vein to draw the blood gradually, as it is intro- duced in the external jugular, (for I constantly select this for the experiment,) and thus pro- ducing artificial plethora, I have, I say, constantly observed that the motion of the heart was accele- rated. I have even noticed in one dog, that the eye became fiery and inflamed, as it were, but this phenomenon was not produced in others; 3dly. We are conscious, that in the act of running, when all the contraction of the muscles acts in all directions upon the veinous blood contained in their tissue, this fluid is propelled to the heart in abundance, and causes very strong palpitations; 4thly. It cannot be doubted that the quantity of urine and faeces are as much, and even more so, causes of involuntary contraction for the bladder and rectum ; 5thly. The fatal effects produced by emetics and purgatives taken in too large doses have been too frequently witnessed; 6thly. A glass of warm water will often fail to bring on vomiting, whilst a pint will produce it in a great degree, &c. &c. F F 2436 MUSCULAR SYSTEM Artificial Excitants. All substances are in general artificial excitants. Such is, in fact, the nature of organic contracti- lity, that if a muscle be in contact with a body it is not accustomed to, it will instantly contract. If the muscles are not irritated by the organs they are surrounded and connected with, it is be- cause habit has blunted the sensation arising from such connection ; but if the state of these organs be changed ; if they are separated from the body, allowed to cool, and then applied to the organic muscles laid bare, they will cause them to con- tract. Caloric, the absence of which constitutes cold, as its presence constitutes heat, will act in the same manner upon muscles, and in general upon every organ. The moment the chest and the pericardium of a living animal are laid open, the heart suddenly beats with additional force, be- cause air acts upon the organ. In the transition from the temperature of the body to another quite different, all aeriform fluids, all light li- quids, &c. are excitants for the muscles. When we observe the heart emptied of blood, the sto- mach and the intestines deprived of the substances they habitually contain, they contract more when they have been removed from the body; it is the surrounding atmosphere and the substancesOP ORGANIC LIFE. 437 with which it is impregnated that produce this ef- fect : they are then the excitants of these organs. Artificial excitants in general act differently; 1st. By contact only ; 2dly. By lacerating or mechanically dividing the fibres ; 3dly. By tend- ing to combine with them ; 4thly. There are some whose mode of action we are completely ignorant of; such is, for instance, electricity. Whenever the excitants act by contact only, the fluids ceteris paribus are more powerful than solids, because they stimulate by a greater num- ber of points; they not only excite the surfaces of the organ, but penetrate also the interstices of the fibres. The solids produce an effect propor- tionate with the extent of their excitement, with the degree of pressure, with their density, their softness, &c. In the ordinary state nature mos^ generally selects fluids for excitants. Laceration produces a greater degree of con- tact. The heart, the intestines, frequently inert when they are merely touched with the knife, contract powerfully when they are punctured. Section produces a less sensible effect than lace- ration. If divided transversely the fibres oscil- late and fluctuate by the sensible organic con- tractility, whilst, by the contractility of the tissue, they undergo a manifest contraction. The chemical agency is, in the greatest num- ber of cases, the most advantageous; but it is necessary to distinguish what belongs to shrink-MUSCULAR SYSTEM 438 ing, and what is the effect of irritability; 1st. If a living frog, from which the cutis has been se- parated, be plunged into a strongly concentrated acid, every part is instantly disorganized ; the re-agent is so powerful, it is impossible to distin- guish either contractility or shrinking ; 2dly. If we dilute the acid a little, and dip another frog into it, the inferior limbs immediately be- come stiff from the contraction of the extensors, which counterbalance the power of the flexors ; in this experiment this phenomenon is almost in- variable : if the animal be withdrawn, the thighs remain motionless, and their life is destroyed; for the contraction that has been produced was not a vital phenomenon. A dead frog immersed in the same liquor undergoes the same phenome- non; reduce the acid still more, the limbs of the \ animal contract the moment he is dropped in; but relaxation will succeed contraction ; these are alternate motions of irritability when brought into action. If the acid, however, has not been suffi- ciently reduced, some marks of shrinking still subsist, and the motions of the posterior extremi- ties are constrained: an evident result of the first degree of shrinking; Finally. If the acid be very weak, it becomes a simple excitant, which produces sensible organic contractility without injuring the tissue of the fibres; when taken from the fluid the animal retains the same powers of motion.OF ANIMAL LIF E, 439 These experiments, which might easily be mul- tiplied on animals possessed of warm blood, but which I have not tried on those species, obviously disclose what belongs to the mechanical, and also to the vital contraction. An exact line, however, cannot be drawn between them, since the acid may be of that degree of strength, that the two causes of motion are confounded together. There is a mode of excitement that authors have not sufficiently noticed ; it may be termed a negative one, and is the same I have just men- tioned. In respect to caloric, the privation of which is frequently a very active stimulant, I have frequently made this observation, in the nu- merous experiments I have performed : — if an excitant be applied to a muscle, it instantly con- tracts ; but after some time the motion ceases, al- though the contact is continued : remove the agent, and the motion will often return instantly. Nothing is more common in the heart, in the in- testines, &c. than contractions ceasing under the continued action of a stimulant, and returning immediately on its being withdrawn. I admit that this phenomenon is not so invariable as that of the contraction produced by the application of a stimulant, which succeeds to a state of non-ex- citement, but it is frequently produced. In this respect it may be said, that the organic is similar to animal sensibility ; that every new state will aflect it, let this state be either a positive or a ne-MUSCULAR SYSTEM 440 gative one. The transition from a state of apa- thy to that of excitement is more rapid; but the reverse transition is not less felt when it is abrupt: besides, this manner of viewing sensible organic contractility in exercise is deserving of further experiments. Of Sensible Organic Contractility, considered in respect to the Organs. Considered with respect to the organ in which it is seated, sensible organic contractility presents innumerable varieties, which relate, First, To the difference of the tissue; Secondly, To age ; Thirdly, To sex; Fourthly, To the constitution of the subject. First Variety. — Difference of the Muscular Tissue. Animal contractility is everywhere the same in the voluntary muscles, on account of their or- ganization being uniform. The number and the length of the fibres being equal, the phenomena of contraction are everywhere exactly the same : here, on the contrary, the varieties in the tissue must necessarily produce others in the vital pro- perties. Every involuntary muscle is first specially connected with the fluid of its habitual stimulant: the blood only is calculated to continue the441 OF ORGANIC LIFE. motions of the heart. If this fluid be altered in any manner whatever, the contractions will be- come irregular. Every heterogeneous substance introduced in the circulation will produce this phenomenon. Urine, which maintains in har- mony the motions of the bladder, would disturb those of the heart, if it be circulated in its cavi- ties. The blood, apparently milder than urine, might occasion spasm of the bladder, if deposited in that organ. I have attended, with Desault, a patient long affected with retention of urine, and from whom he had extracted a very large stone. Subsequent to the operation, the urine stagnated in the bladder as long as the former remained pure ; but the moment a little blood found its way into the organ, it caused involuntary contraction, and the bloody urine was expelled. The faeces, which remain for some time in the rectum with- out causing contraction, would instantly act upon the stomach, &c. All these phenomena also rally around the varieties of sensibility in the mucous membranes, varieties to which we shall return. They evidently prove that each individual muscle is possessed of a degree of organic contractility peculiar to it, and upon which certain fluids only in the animal economy can act with regularity. Heterogeneous fluids give the same result: eme- tics, which cause the stomach to contract, might be injected into the bladder with impunity ; pur- gatives cause no vomiting, &c. This connectionMUSCULAR SYSTEM 442 of such fluids with the sensible organic contracti- lity will take place, whether, as in the preceding case, these fluids are applied over the mucous sur- faces that correspond to the muscles, or they be conveyed to these muscles by circulation, as has been proved by the experiments performed in the last century, on introducing medicated substances into the veins ; of which experiments Haller has collected a multiplicity of results. In these ex- periments circulation has been seen conveying to all the organs, at one time, emetics, and the sto- mach alone contracted ; at another time purga- tives, and the intestines only were brought into action, &c. Taken in by cutaneous absorption, the medicated substances give rise to a similar phenomenon. Purgatives and emetics, &c. ap- plied by friction, cause the contraction, not of all the organic muscles, although circulation con- veys these substances to all, but of those with which their sensibility is connected. During the various diseases that are seated in these organs, each organic muscle is seen to pos- sess a peculiar mode of irritation, to answer to one stimulant, and remain insensible, as it were, in the rest. Second Variety.—Age. Age modifies sensible organic contractility in a remarkable degree. Very striking in infancy>OF ORGANIC LIFE. 443 the muscles obey the exciting agents with the ut- most punctuality ; the bladder does not retain urine long; children expel it involuntarily during sleep ; the heart contracts with a rapidity pro- claimed by the pulse; all the phenomena of di- gestion are more rapidly performed; hence a shorter interval before the return of hunger : this is a phenomenon analogous with that of the vo- luntary muscles, in which the rapidity of the mo- tions is allied (in the early stage of life) with a deficiency of strength. Subsequent to infancy, the readiness with which the muscles answer their stimulants progressively decreases : hence all the important phenomena of organic life gradually decline. The number of pulsations, the time required for digestion, for retention of the urine, &c. are the thermometers of that decline. In the aged subject, ail the powers are weak- ened ; the action of the organic muscles gradually fade away. Those of the bladder and of the rec- tum are the most liable to lose their contractile powers: hence the retention of urine, the very frequent appendage of old age ; hence again the accumulation of the faeces above the anus, which, like the former affection, although not sufficiently noticed by practitioners, is so common at that stage of life. The rich, who indulge them- selves in the luxuries of the table, are particu-444 MUSCULAR SYSTEM larly liable to this affection. I have seen many cases of it, at least as many as of retention, dur- ing the last year of Desault’s practice. The func- tions of the intestines, and of the stomach, decay much later. The heart resists the longest: this organ is the ultimum moriens, as it was the first in exercise. Its action determines the duration of organic life. Third Variety—Constitution. The individual constitution modifies organic contractility in a very remarkable manner. It is sufficiently known, that in some subjects the pul- sations are more frequent, the secretion of urine more rapid $ that with others everything in or- ganic life is stamped by a remarkably slow pro- gress : now all these varieties most evidently have their primitive source in the contractility of the heart, of the stomach, of the intestines, &c. which have, in what regards this, a considerable influ- ence over the different temperaments. In this respect two essential considerations should be noticed : 1st. The varied powers of organic muscles do not always coincide with those of the muscles of animal life. Thus some persons are remarkable for a want of expression in the contour of the body, and for a weakness in the muscles of the4 J5 OF ORGANIC LIFE. limbs; whilst the powers of digestion, and the force with which the urine is evacuated, &c. de- note the utmost energy of sensible organic con- tractility. I have remarked in this respect, that the powers of the heart are more frequently propor- tionate with the exterior muscles, than those of the stomach, of the intestines, and of the bladder. A full, strong pulse, coincides in general with an athletic constitution, whilst such a constitution is often united to a weak gastric system in the same subject, and more particularly strong powers of digestion are often combined with muscular de- bility. This fact, demonstrated by the different temperaments in man, is most evident in the se- ries of animals. Those which like the carnivorous species are endowed with great muscular powers, have the parieties of their gastric cavities mem- branous, as it were. These parieties strengthen in the herbivorous species: they become very striking in the gallinaceous species. In general, mastication, which depends upon animal contrac- tility, is in animals in a reverse ratio with the powers of trituration of the stomach, over which sensible organic contractility presides. 2dly. The varieties of this property, in what relate to constitutions, present another pheno- menon that hardly ever interferes with the mus- cular system of animal life. In fact, in this these varieties are always general; we may, indeed, strengthen by exercise, such and such a muscular446 MUSCULAR SYSTEM region, but the distinctions of the natural pow- ers relate to the whole system. The arms, the legs, the chest, the abdomen, are uniformly contractile in the different divisions that belong to them. This uniformity, on the contrary, is very seldom seen in the voluntary muscles: most gene- rally one will predominate over the others : some- times it is the heart, at other times the stomach, and sometimes the bladder. Frequently even all the gastric powers are not in the same proportion; the stomach will be languid whilst the intestines retain their natural action ; or although the sto- mach is in perfect order, the intestines being too contractile, instantly reject the faeees, and pro- duce diarrhoea. This essential distinction between the two muscular systems, proceeds from the contractility of the one depending upon a com- mon centre, the brain ; whilst that of the other, on the contrary, has its isolated principle in every part where it exists. Fourth Variety.—Sex. Women in general have more resemblance to children in their phenomena of sensible organic contractility. The weakness of their motions coincides with their greater rapidity in this sex, with whom all the interior muscles, like the ex- i terior ones, are thinner and weaker than in man. One might suppose that in them the powers ofOF ORGANIC LIFE. 447 the womb have been produced at the expence of those of all the other organs. In experiments the results obtained from the female are less striking, and not near so long continued as those from the male. The heart, the stomach, the in- testines, &c. cease their action much quicker; these motions are less ; they require more power- ful agents to be excited, &c. Fifth Variety.— Season and Climate. During winter and in cold climates, when the cutaneous organ, contracted and shrunk, as it were, by the impression of the surrounding at- mosphere, is in a weak state of action^ all the interior functions more active, necessitate addi- tional energy in the powers which preside over them ; all the phenomena of digestion, the excre- tion of urine, and even of circulation, are better developed. I am not aware that comparative ex- periments have yet been made respecting the degrees of irritability in the different seasons; but I am convinced they would give different results. Sensible Organic Contractility considered in re- spect to the Action of the Stimulating Agents over the Organs. We have just examined separately, both the excitant and the organ upon which it acts, eachMUSCULAR SYSTEM 448 being isolated is null in respect to sensible organic contractdity; from their concurrence only, the exercise of this property will result. Now we are ignorant of what takes place in this concur- rence. To pretend to ascertain it, would be pre- tending to say how one body attracts another, how an acid combines with an alkali, &c. In at- traction, affinity, and irritability, we can follow the phenomena no further than to the action of bodies upon each other. This action is the boun- dary of our researches. But what should not escape our notice here is, that in this last property the action is never im- mediate. There is always between the excitant and the organ an intermediate that receives the irritation ; this intermediate is a thin membrane, and continued with that of the arteries for the heart; it is a mucous surface for the gastric vis- cera, and for the bladder. This intermediate ad- mits better of receiving the excitement than the muscles itself. I have constantly observed, that by irritating the internal surface of the heart, the contractions of this organ were more acute, than by laying its exterior tissue bare by the removal of its serous envelopement, and by exciting it subsequently. It is the same in respect to the organic muscles of the abdomen. Are there between the excited intermedium and the organ some nervous communications that transmit the impression ? I believe not: the cel-449 OF ORGANIC LIFE. hilar tissue is sufficient. In fact, the serous sur- faces have nothing interposed between them and the organic muscles but this tissue as a medium of union : their life is by no means connected with that of the latter, since, as we shall perceive, they are often separated, and yet they may transmit the excitement. The pericardium and the peritoneum, on being irritated in their parts corresponding to the organ intended to be moved, cause it to contract. This fact has been observed, even by those who have made but few experiments; generally it is in this manner that the heart, the stomach, the intestines, the blad- der, &c. are stimulated. By gently moving the excitant over the serous surface, so that no mo- tion is communicated to the fleshy fibres, an effect is produced. Simple contact, however, does not suffice to transmit the irritation; for instance, by leaving the external sheet of the pericardium applied over the heart, and then exciting it, the organ remains unmoved. If the peritoneum be separated from the bladder, every cellular attachment is torn ; if it be then re-applied to the organ, and excited, the same state of immobility will be observed. Whenever the interposed membrane that re- ceives the excitement is diseased, the contracti- lity is invariably altered. The same exciting cause produces slow or rapid contractions accordingly as the affection exalts or reduces the sensibility of VOL. II. G GMUSCULAR SYS7! EM 450 such intermedium. A slight inflammation of the external surface of the bladder causes a kind of incontinence of urine ; that of the intestines brings on diarrhoea, &c. &c.; on the contrary, old catarrhs of the bladder, (affections in which the weakness of the mucous surface of that organ predominates), are frequent causes of retention, &c. The interposition of this intermedium consti- tutes a very remarkable difference between the sensible and the insensible organic contractility; no such interposition exists in the latter, wherein the very same system receives the impression, and re-acts upon the body that ’has produced it; for instance, in the glandular, serous, cutaneous sys- tems, &c. the fluid that reaches them for secre- tion or exhalation produces in these systems a sensation which is instantly followed by re-ac- tion. In the sensible contractility on the con- trary, one system perceives and the other moves. This mode of action recedes less from that of animal life, in which the organs of our senses, and those of motion, totally differing, are far asunder. Sensible Organic Contractility considered relative to its Permanence after Death. This property is longer continued than that of animal contractility. On irritating the mar-451 OF ORGANIC LIFE. vow the exterior muscles remain unmoved, whilst the internal still continue active. So many instances have been quoted of this permanence, and Haller has made so many experiments on this head, that I think it unnecessary to quote further proofs of a fact no longer called in question; to this are owing the evacuations of feeces and urine which take place subsequent to death; the vomitings noticed in some subjects, if not so evident as during life, are yet sufficient to bring up the food to the mouth of the corpse, which, as I have observed, is sometimes filled. Two kinds of death in respect to this perma- nent state, as well as to the continuance of ani- mal contractility, may be distinguished; 1st. Sudden death ; 2dly. That brought on by long continued disease. In every sudden death, produced either by a violent injury of the brain, as in apoplexy, con- cussion, compression, effusion, &c. or by an affec- tion of the heart, as in prolonged syncopy, a wound, a ruptured aneurism, or by the lungs ceasing to act, as in asphyxia from deleterious gases, from vacuum, submersion, &c. the continu- ance of contractility is very obvious; general death first ensues, then the organs individually die, and all the vital powers fall in succession. In every kind of death slowly produced, par- ticularly in that preceded by a decline, the partial death of each organ is first observed ; all the vital G G 2MUSCULAR SYSTEM 452 powers decline and die away by degrees, pre- vious to the fall of the whole (which consti- tutes general death); on this event, none of the vitalities peculiar to each organ survive, whilst, after sudden death, they are more or less continued. ' Experiments cannot fairly be tried on subjects obtained from hospitals, because they cannot be procured until twelve, or fifteen hours after death ; but by killing dogs by hunger, which, if too long continued, will degenerate into a true disease, continuing eight, ten, or even twelve days, I have seen contractility completely anni- hilated at the moment of death. I have frequently had dogs brought to me affected with various dis- eases, particularly a few years ago, when a kind of epidemic affection raged amongst them. Now, on opening them at the moment of death, or on killing them before, to cause death sud- denly, quite different from that occurring in the state of health, in which the functions, and of course the vital powers of every part, were unin- jured, I could never discover the least contrac- tility, or at least it was so effectually reduced that it seemed wanting. Several physiologists have mentioned a general convulsion that seizes upon the organic muscles at the instant of death, of a heaving of the sto- mach, of the heart, of the intestines, &c. This excess of action is sometimes real in suddenOF ORGANIC LIFE. 4 5S death, particularly in those caused by our expe- riments, very seldom met with in those which result from a long disease wherein the patient sinks insensibly, and gradually passes from life to death. Authors have been too much in the habit of generalizing facts observed under particular circumstances. From this a multiplicity of erro- neous consequences have been deduced. Sympathies. No organs are so readily influenced by the others as the organic muscles, but not all in the same degree. The heart in this respect is first in rank, next comes the stomach, afterwards the in- testines, and, finally, the bladder. This influence will now be examined. It is a remarkable phenomenon, that every af- fection at all powerful in the economy will in- stantly affect the motions of the heart. The slightest wound, the least pain, is sufficient to disturb this organ. Now there are two species of these disturbances: sometimes its action is momentarily obstructed ; hence syncopies, a mode of derangement very common in violent and s'udden pains. The vulgar expression, “ my heart fails me, &c.” used in such cases, is correct. At other times, and this is the most general, the ac- tion is accelerated : hence the febrile motions so very frequent in every local affection, motionsMUSCULAR SYSTEM 454 purely sympathetic, and which cease the moment the affection subsides. In a multiplicity of local inflammations, the evil is too much circumscribed to admit of an obstacle to the course of the blood, an obstacle which, according to Boerhaave, com- pels the heart to increase its action to resist it; besides, when there is no obstruction in the part, but pain only, and fever is produced, it is un- doubtedly a sympathetic phenomenon. The in- crease in the action of the heart may undoubt- edly depend upon some heterogeneous substance, which being mixed with the blood, alters the fluid, and renders it more irritating; or it may proceed from an affection in the substance of the organ, which disposes it-to be move irritable ; but undoubtedly it is often sympathetic, and de- pends upon that unknown connection which binds all our organs together, upon that consent between all their actions, and reciprocal dependence upon each other. As much might be said in respect to the sto- mach, although its sympathetic re-action is not quite so frequently produced as that of the heart; but in many cases it becomes very striking. The greatest part of local affections, of inflammations especially, are attended with sympathetic vo- miting. The accession of different fevers present instances of similar vomitings. In hospitals par- ticularly, these phenomena are frequently ob- served. Several physicians have not consideredOF ORGANIC LIFC. 455 these vomitings as merely sympathetic, but as a manifestation of a bilious affection, grounding their opinions on the bile that is ejected in such cases ; but in every animal I have opened, I have most generally found the empty stomach to con- tain a certain quantity of this fluid, which had re- flowed from the duodenum ; other authors have also made similar observations ; so that it appears when the stomach is empty the presence of the bile is a natural phenomenon : hence it is not astonishing, if on the invasion of such fevers, and even during their course, the stomach being sym- pathetically excited, more or less of this fluid is brought up. It might take place during health, df vomiting were produced by emetics. The same occurrence sometimes happens in the morning, if, previous to having taken any food, any cause un- connected with liver complaint, such, for in- stance, as the sight of a disgusting object, causes vomiting; bile then is brought up with other contents from the organ. I do not deny that the liver being frequently sympathetically affected on the accession of diseases, will secrete more bile ; that this superabundant fluid reflowing to the stomach, Vvili cause this viscus to contract ; cer- tainly this is not most frequently the case ; bile is vomited the same as it is expelled with the faeces, because it happens to be in the stomach and in the intestines, but not because it is in greater abundance. If vomiting were a natural effect’MUSCULAR SYSTEM 456 bilious evacuations by the alimentary canal would be as natural as the greenish hue of the faeces in the state of health. From this then it is seen, that bilious vomiting is, in a number of cases, merely accessary, and the essential phenomenon is the sympathetic contraction of the stomach. In the case I have just been mentioning, it is evident there is no gastric affection ; the sympa- thetic alteration in the stomach depends upon the fleshy fibres only. But in general this gastric af- fection takes place on the invasion of diseases wherein local affection exists: earthy matter, as they term it, is brought up : it is because the or- gan being essentially affected, the lungs, for in- stance, if it be in peripneumony, have acted sym- pathetically, not only upon the fleshy fibres, but also upon the mucous membrane. This excited, its secretion is increased ; hence that earthy mat- ter, which is nothing more than mucus mixed with gastric juices and bile. Now the presence of this matter is often sufficient to cause the stomach to contract, and the vomiting by which it is ex- it is evident from this, that sympathetic vomit- ing may exist without any disorder of the sto- mach, and sympathetic gastric disorder without immediate vomiting. In the first case, the sym- pathetic influence of the affected organ relates to the fleshy fibres ; in the second, to the mucous membrane. But how is it that the stomach is ex-OF ORGANIC LIFE. 457 cited, when the lungs, the pleura, the skin, &c. are affected ? I have previously remarked that, in respect to the connections of our organs, the word “ sympathy ” is nothing more than a cloak for our ignorance. Vomiting from erysipelas, phlegmon, pleurisy, peripneumony, &c. is then most frequently an effect perfectly analogous with the increased action of the heart which pro- duces fever. It is similar to the cerebral affection causing delirium, an affection that is not so fre- quently met with, &c. AJ1 these phenomena in- dicate that all the other organs have by re-action sympathized with the affected one, &c. Physicians, who have not considered all these phenomena in a grand and general light, have confined their practice within very narrow limits. In former times, much attention was paid to the sympathe- tic disturbance of the heart, and bleeding was frequently prescribed at the commencement of diseases: latterly, the sympathetic derangement of the stomach is especially attended to, and eme- tics are frequently given : at a future period more attention will, perhaps, be paid to the sensation of heaviness in the head, to the pains felt in that region, to the want of sleep, to somnolency, &c. which are very common sympathetic affections, and the treatment will be directed to the brain. In these varieties, the judicious physician will consider all these phenomena in a general light; he will see in all of them that general consentMUSCULAR SYSTEM 458 which connects all the functions with each otherf and binds them and their disorders together ; he will see every organ rise, as it were, to repel the enemy introduced into the economy, and each re- act in his own way ; he will see these re-actions produce quite different effects, according to the respective organs—fever arising from the re-ac- tion of the heart; delirium, heaviness, want of sleep, convulsions, &c. from that of the brain ; vomiting, from that of the stomach ; diarrhoea, from that of the intestines ; the gastric and in- testinal obstructions and furred tongue, from those of the mucous membranes, the overflow of bile from that of the liver, &c. Thus in a ma- chine where all the parts are connected and de- pendent upon each other, if one piece be de- ranged, all will be so. We should laugh at the mechanic who would apply himself to repair one of the parts only, and who would neglect to re- medy the local derangement from which all those in the machine have arisen. Let us not disregard the physician who contends with an isolated symp- tom, without attacking the disease, the principle of which he is frequently unacquainted with, al- though he knows this principle exists; but we may be allowed to smile at him, if he gives to his treatment a degree of importance perfectly null, when compared to that of the evil. After the stomach, the intestines are the most frequently affected in diseases. The bladder is, of459 OF ORGANIC LIFE. all the organic muscles, the least affected by the influence radiating from the diseased organ ; but it is sometimes disordered. We are aware that in fevers, the retentions of urine from sympathe- tic and temporary paralysis are not very scarce ; incontinence of urine is not so common. Character of the Vital Properties. From what we have said, it is obvious, that the vital properties are very active in organic muscles, particularly in what relates to contractility. These muscles during life are actually in a permanent state of activity : they are readily influenced by the other organs. Their vital properties, parti- cularly those I have just mentioned, are altered with the utmost promptitude, for insensible con- tractility is seldom affected, because in those organs it does not take a very essential part. In fact the morbid derangements of an organ con- stantly bear upon the vital power which predo- minates in that organ. Animal contractility is frequently affected in the preceding system ; in thi$ it is sensible organic contractility. The in- sensible contractility or tone, on the contrary, be- ing less so, the phenomena over which it presides almost invariably remain the same : nutrition is uniformly continued ; the structural diseases of muscles are scarce ; when they occur, it is more frequently from communication, as in cancerMUSCULAR SYSTEM 460 of the stomach, where the disease begins over the mucous surface, and where the fleshy fibres are only consecutively affected: the heart and the womb are the most liable to these morbid altera- tions ; and yet in the former they more frequently belong to the internal membrane than to the fleshy fibres. In those systems, on the contrary, in which sensible organic contractility is incessantly in action, as in the cutaneous, the serous, &c. where it presides over nutrition and exhalation; in the glandular, the mucous, &c. where it pro- duces both secretion and nutrition, &c. it is par- ticularly affected. From these derangements arise the alterations of the tissue, the organic diseases properly so called, as common in these systems, as they are rare in those in which insensible con- tractility, very obscure, exists in such a degree onlyTts may be indispensable for nutrition. To this also must be referred the rarity of acute inflammations in this system. This affection is as common in the cutaneous, serous, mucous sys- tems, &c. as it is rare in this wherein the natural functions require but little tone. Those who at- tend dissections are conscious the tissue of the heart is hardly ever found inflamed. Nothing is more common than inflammations of the external or serous membranes, or of the mucous and in- ternal membrane of the stomach, the intestines, &c., but nothing more obscure or more seldom observed than that of their fleshy tunic. In rheu-I OF ORGANIC LIFE. 461 matism, when the pains around the articulations have subsided, there are sometimes violent cholics, even spasmodic vomitings, indicating probably some acute affection of the gastric and intestinal fibres; but these affections can never be traced ; the muscular tissue is never seen tinged of the bright red colour of the mucous, cutaneous, or se- rous organs, when inflamed—at least, I have never observed it. Physicians have not paid sufficient attention to the varieties of inflammation in the different sys- tems ; but, above all, they have not sufficiently observed that this difference perfectly coincides with that of tone, or insensible organic contrac- tility ; that wherever this vital power is the most striking, there is a greater tendency to inflamma- tion, because it presides over their production ; because these affections imply its increase, in the same manner as convulsions imply an increase of animal contractility ; as vomiting, palpitations of the heart, suppose a similar state of the organic contractility,'&c. I cannot repeat too often, that the diseases most common to each system bring into play, increase, or reduce the vital powers predominant in that system. Here is a new pa- thological observation which may prove fruitful in its results.MUSCULAR SYSTEM 462 ARTICLE IV. Phenomena of the Action of the Muscular System of Organic Life. These phenomena, as in the preceding system, relate to the state of contraction, or to that of relaxation. i SECTION I. Powers of Contractions. This is never increased to that degree some- times observed in the muscles of animal life. There is a much greater difference between the strongest pulse and the weakest, between the feebleness with which the urine is expelled previous to some cases of its retention, and the full flow from a powerful subject, than between the languid state of the voluntary muscles of some females, and the energy of those of a maniac, of a man in a fit of passion, &c. The heart and the deltoid are nearly in an equal proportion in respect to their fleshy mass : but what would become of circulation, if the former were sometimes to propel the blood with force equal to that with which the latter elevates the upper extremity; a fit of passion, or madness, would be sufficient to produce aneurisms, &e. The organic muscles on the other hand, are not liable to that loss of power so very commonOF ORGANIC LIFE. 463 in the others; they are never affected with pa- ralysis, because they are not under the influence of the brain. There is, however, something an- swering to convulsions in the irregular actions which produce so many varieties of pulse in acute fevers, actions that should be properly distin- guished from those produced by an organic affec- tion of the heart; but these are quite different from the spasms of the voluntary muscles; there is not even the slightest analogy between them. There is not in the powers of contraction of the muscles we are viewing the waste that is so very remarkable in those of the other muscles; the force is nearly in proportion to the exciting cause, and the distinction of this cause both in absolute and effective could not be applied here ; only more contractile power is required accord- ingly as the substance expelled from a hollow ' muscle is fluid or solid. This explains why, in the large intestines, the longitudinal fibres are more characterized than tbose of the small in- testines ; why the rectum particularly, in which the fseces have their utmost degree of solidity, display these fibres still more conspicuously than in the colon and coecum, although under a different form ; why in diarrhoea the slightest con- traction will empty the intestines, whilst fre- quently to expel very solid excrements, the sen- sible organic contractility of the rectum being deficient, the assistance of the abdominal muscles/ 464 MUSCULAR SYSTEM is frequently required to effect the expulsion ; why, when a solid body has been admitted into the stomach, and it cannot be softened by the gastric juices, it remains a long time before it is excited, and causes a very troublesome weight, &c. &c. It it well known with what rapidity the fluids pass from the stomach to the intestines, how long, on the contrary, the solid food re- mains in the former of these organs, &c. The powers of organic muscles are incompa- rably greater in the phenomena of life than in our experiments. Once laid bare, the action of the heart becomes weak, and in general irregu- lar ; there is no kind of proportion between the power required to force the blood to the distance of seven or eight feet from the punctured carotid of a dog, and the strength of contractions caused by the strongest stimulant. In the heart removed from the body, no contraction in our experiments is equal to that which produces vomiting, &c. &c. Calculations ad infinitum have been resorted to, to ascertain the powers of contractions of the organic as well as of the other muscles, and they have produced the same varieties in their results. How, in fact, can the degrees of any action which a thousand causes may change momentarily, be submitted to calculation, not only in distinct in- dividuals, but in the same subject? Incessantly modified by sleep, digestion, exercise, rest, by peace of the mind, the storm of passions, night,OF ORGANIC LIFE. 465 day, by every thing in a word ? We cannot tell if digestion occurs twice within the same period, if the urine is retained twice for the same space of time in the bladder before it is expelled, if it is twice expelled with the same degree of force, &c. Frequently even, whilst the other muscles are lingering under a weakened state, the powers of organic muscles are left in their natural degree. A weak pulse, vomiting, diarrhoea, &c. &c. coin- ciding with a general prostration in the muscles of animal life, are not uncommon phenomena in diseases. SECTION II. Rapidity of Contractions. Thi s is subject to very great variation: very rapid in experiments when death is still recent and the excitants very powerful; contractions in general are slower in the natural state; one might say it is quite the reverse as to the power: frequently the instant the pericardium is open, particularly if before the organ has been laid open, it has been injected with an irritating fluid, the heart is seen to move with a rapidity which the eye can hardly follow, &c. In some diseases the rapidity of contractions is considerably increased ; those of the heart, for instance, are frequently VOL. II. H H466 MUSCULAR SYSTEM much more rapid than in early age ; this rapidity is also in this case perfectly distinct from the power of contractions; very seldom even are these two things united in the highest degree. In general, whenever the power of the heart is augmented, its motion is certainly rather more rapid ; but very frequently there is a reduction of power united to additional quickness, or the power remains the same, the rapidity being con- siderably increased. We have noticed that the voluntary muscles have in general a degree of rapidity they never exceed, and that this rapidity depends upon the constitution. Is not the very same phenomenon observed here? Frequently in two fevers, the symptoms being the same, the degree of in- tensity in every respect perfectly similar, the pulse will be more rapid in one subject than in . the other. This does not always denote a differ- •/ ence in the disease, but in the constitution, that one of the two hearts is more apt to contract much quicker than the other, from the same cause ? Who is not aware that in experiments contractile rapidity varies ad infinitum, under the influence of the same causes ? Each organic muscle is possessed of its peculiar degree of rapidity ; the heart, the stomach, the intestines, the bladder, &c. essentially differ from each other in this respect.OF ORGANIC LIFE. 467 SECTION III. Continuance of Contractions. The heart never remains in a state of perma* nent contraction, as is frequently the case with the voluntary muscles. Although hunger seem- ingly proves the contrary with respect to the stomach, and in the intestines, yet this phenome* non is not contradictory : in fact, the permanent contraction of the gastric viscera when empty, proceeds from the contractility of the tissue. When sensible organic contractility is brought into play, there are alternate contractions and dilatations: by this alternate state, essentially characterized, and distinguished from animal con- tractility, and from that of the tissue wherein contraction is frequently continued. SECTION IV. State of the Muscles during Contraction. v The phenomenon described as belonging to the voluntary muscles, are nearly all applicable to these, such as induration, increase of thickness, i reduction in length, expression of blood, &c. &c.; ' but in what regards the mode of contraction, B there is some difference between the heart and B the gastric muscles. In fact, in the former are h h 2MUSCULAR SYSTEM 468 very evidently seen; 1st. Complete contractions similar to those of the voluntary muscles, con- tractions which take place during health, which cause the projection of blood, and which are easily produced in experiments when the animal is still alive ; 2dly. Multiplied oscillations of the fibres which agitate them all without producing any sensible effect, without contracting the ca- vity, without forcing out the blood for instance. These oscillations are observed at the moment of death, when the heart ceases to contract; it is then in vain we apply stimulants, perfect con- traction cannot be produced; although a general vibration is very evident, the cavity is not con- tracted, and the contained blood accumulates. In this respect the heart perfectly resembles the vo- luntary muscles; it is agitated in the same man- ner as these muscles, in ague, in what is termed shivering, and which is observed in the subcuta- neous muscles of some individuals: I have al- ready seen several persons affected with an habi tual and irregular action in a portion of the so- leus perfectly distinct to the eye through the skin, and which did not interfere with the con- traction necessary to the extension of the foot. This two-fold mode of contraction is never met with in the involuntary muscles of the abdomen. Instead of abrupt, sudden contractions, nothing but a slow shrinking, frequently hardly apparent, is observed; there is not even, properly speakOF ORGANIC LIFE. 469 ing, total contraction, like that of the heart wherein every fibre of an oracle, or a ventricle, moves at the same time; here each fleshy fibre seems to act in succession. If placed at the origin of the large vessels, the stomach or bladder could not possibly propel the blood in jerks, as it is propelled from an artery at each contraction. On the other hand, the instant motion subsides in the stomach, the intestines, and the bladder, these os- cillations, always observed in the heart and in the voluntary muscles, and which may even be produced at will, are never seen. section v. Motions produced by the Organic Muscles. \ There is scarcely ever any simple motion in these muscles; the varied interlacement of their fleshy layers causes them generally to act on the substances they contain in three or four different directions. We cannot speak generally of those motions which compose the diastole of the heart, the peristaltic motion of the alimentary tube, the contraction of the bladder, &c. Each muscle has its mechanism that belongs to the physiological history of the function to which it contributes.470 MUSCULAR SYSTEM SECTION V. Phenomena of the Relaxation of the Organic Muscles. During the relaxation of organic muscles, the phenomena are generally the reverse of the pre- ceding. It is therefore useless to state them : but here is a question to be examined, namely to know what is the nature of that state which succeeds contraction and alternates with it. In the muscles of animal life, when contraction ceases, it is not in general the muscle itself that returns to its preceding state of extension. This is effected by its antagonist: for instance, when the biceps have contracted to bend the fore-arm, and its contraction has ceased, it becomes passive; the triceps then coming in motion, extend it and cause it to return to its natural position, by first acting - upon the bones which communicate the motion to this muscle. Every muscular power of animal life finds, then, in that opposed to it, a cause for returning to the state it had departed from in contracting. It is not the same thing with respect to organic life ; its muscles, which are hollow, have no antagonists. We have, in fact, to a cer- tain degree, considered as such the substances contained within their cavities, and which oppose the effect of contraction ; but most generally notOF ORGANIC LIFE. 471 being calculated to re-act after having been com- pressed by their want of elasticity, these sub- stances cannot possibly fulfil the same office as the antagonist. The greatest number of physiologists have ad- mitted, as a cause of dilatation, the admission of fresh substances which replace in the muscular cavities those expelled by contraction : thus the admission of new blood in the heart, that of food in the different parts of the alimentary tube have been considered to dilate these organs; so that by this opinion muscles would merely be passive on dilating. But the following considerations, of which some authors,’ particularly Grimaud, have already presented a few, do not allow of consi- dering the dilatation of organic muscles in this way, that of the heart in particular. 1st. When a hollow muscle is laid bare, as the heart, the stomach, or the intestines, &c. and the substances contained are completely with- drawn, if a stimulant be applied externally, it will alternately dilate and contract in the same manner as when it is filled ; 2dly. If on empty- ing, by puncture, all the large vessels that resort to the heart and those which proceed from it, and that organ be completely evacuated, its alternate dilatations and evacuations will still be continued for some time; 3dly. To judge comparatively of the degree of power of contraction and di- latation, let two hearts, nearly equal in size, be472 MUSCULAR SYSTEM extracted from any living animals; instantly place the fingers of one hand in the auricles or ventricles of one, and grasp with the other the exterior of the second, and it will be found that the effort of the latter on dilating, is quite as powerful as that of the other in contracting. This fact, which had already been observed by Pechlin, is so much the more remarkable, as the effort of dilatation frequently exceeds that of contraction. I have even observed in repeating that experi- ment, that howTever much the organ is com- pressed, it cannot be prevented from dilating ; 4thly. The alternate extension and contraction from which the vermicular motion of the intes- tines arises, is observed in hunger, on opening the abdomen of an animal; 5thly. The hardness of the muscular tissue, is as evident when the or- gan is dilated as when it is empty ; 6thly. I have frequently observed that the instant I irritated the heart with the point of the knife, dilatation was the first result, and contraction was only com secutive. In experiments it generally happens that contraction is first observed, but there is no doubt that when the muscle is at rest it is often dilated previously. It seems then highly probable that the dilatation of organic muscles depends as much upon vitality as their contraction; that these two states are unavoidably connected ; that their union forms the muscular motion, of which contraction is only a part. Who can say that473 OF ORGANIC LIFE. each could not be separately deranged; that a regular contraction cannot be succeeded by an irregular dilatation, and vice versa ? Who knows if certain alterations in the pulse do not proceed from irregular dilatations, and others from irregu- lar contraction ? Iam far from maintaining this : for in physic, our belief should not rest upon pre- sumption, but upon facts ; but it might be an in- teresting object of research. It appears that sometimes the voluntary mus- cles are really the seat of active dilatation ; 1st. Laid bare or removed from the body, a muscle contracts and subsequently dilates, without the operation of any cause with regard’ to the latter state ; 2dly. In amputation, the ends of the di- vided fibres are often seen to shorten and elon- gate alternately in the stump, a two-fold motion which seems also to be vital; 3dly. In different species of convulsions in which the limbs become stiff; in those for instance which accompany hys- teria, there seems to be a very active and rather considerable dilatation: in fact, on placing the hand upon muscles which, from the disposition of the part, ought then to be relaxed, they feel quite as hard as when they are contracted, &c. There is ample scope for further research on this mode of dilatation of our parts, a mode which certainly is not exclusively limited to the muscu- lar system, but seems also to belong to the iris, to the spongy tissue of the corpus cavernosum, to474 MUSCULAR SYSTEM the nipple of the breast, &c. All these organs move by evident dilatation ; contraction succeeds expansion, as in the ordinary muscles; relaxation succeeds contraction. Expansion is the principal phenomenon. Perhaps, as some modern authors have asserted, the sudden swellings that attend contusions, bruises, &c. are a result of this kind of motion. * ARTICLE V. Developement of the Muscular System of Organic Life. In respect to its developement, the organic muscular system is completely the reverse of the preceding. As much as this is obscure in early life, so much the increase is conspicuous in the former. Let us follow it in every stage of life. SECTION i. State of the Organic Muscular System in the Foetus. The heart is already formed in the early days of conception ; first it offers a point in motion as * # they term it, punctum saliens. The successive progress of its growth in the early months, has been elucidated by the researches of several au- thors, by Haller in particular. The muscles within the abdomen, requiring, however, rather more475 OF ORGANIC LIFE* time in forming, are developed long before those intended to form the parieties of that cavity. It is the volume of the intestines, of the stomach, of the bladder, &o. that give to the cavity in which these organs are contained, the remarkable capacity observed at that stage of life. All the organic muscles, nearly uniform at that stage in respect to their proportions of volume, are not so in what regards that of their tissue. The heart is evidently denser and harder than the rest; its texture is strongly characterized. Soft and loose, the fibres of the stomach, intestines, and bladder, perfectly resemble, in this respect, the muscles of animal life ; they contain but a small portion of blood, when compared to that which will subsequently be circulated through them. Their redness is as striking; they are pe- netrated with the same quantity of blood, and are consequently nourished by that fluid. This redness of the heart, perfectly similar to that of the voluntary muscles in the adult, forms a con- trast at that period with their remarkable pale- ness. It presents, besides, the same as in every other part wherein it exists, a deep hue, proceed- ing from the kind of blood that produces it. The reason that so much blood penetrates the heart, is easily conceived, since that organ, very active in its motions, requires considerable force, whilst the others, nearly all in a state of inacti- vity, require much less.476 MUSCULAR SYSTEM The sensible organic contractility of the heart in the foetus and in the early age, has, however, been too much exaggerated, undoubtedly on ac- count of the excessive rapidity of circulation at that stage. This rapidity proceeds as much from the activity of the tonic powers of the general capillary system, as from that of the heart; be- cause, as we have remarked, when once the blood has reached the general capillary system, this fluid is no longer under the influence of the heart, and its continuance in that system depends en- tirely upon the power of the system itself. Now at that period very active, these powers accelerate the course of the blood, and propel it into the veinous system, from which it reaches the heart; the irritability of which is then doubled, or even trebled. If the blood reached it but slowly, it could not possibly keep up a rapid and at the same time a continued pulse. Haller has suffered himself to be misled in this respect, by supposing that the heart was the sole impulsive agent of the blood circulating, even in the most minute ves- sels : besides, the sensible organic contractility of the heart is not in the foetus very easily brought into action by our experiments, and its duration is much shorter. Then the strongest stimulants have less power over it immediately after death, than the weakest have over the heart of an animal that has breathed. I have repeatedly verified this in the fetuses of guinea pigs. Compared with that of477 OF organic life. the voluntary muscles, the motion of the heart is undoubtedly very remarkable in the foetus; but it is not so, compared to what it will be subsequent to birth. The very same thing is observed in respect to the contractility of the stomach, bladder, and in- testines : stimulants in general fail to produce any kind of motion in these muscles. Leveille has already set forth these important observations; he has also observed 'urine stagnate in the blad- der, and meconium in the large intestines, without producing sufficient contraction for their expul- sion. I do not believe, however, that the gastric viscera are ever wholly immoveable during life ; and this is the reason : most commonly the meco- nium is met with in the large intestines only ; of course, then, it must originate in these organs, if it be true that the gastric muscles are motionless. Now it is much more probable that it is a residue of the bile, of all the mucous juices, &c.; that, consequently, it is progressively conveyed by a slow action, from the superior to the inferior part of the alimentary canal. The softness of the organic muscles renders their extensibility much less striking at that stage. The heart of the dead foetus, however, does not present these innumerable varieties of volume so frequently observed in the right side of that of an adult, according to the nature of the death.478 MUSCULAR SYSTEM SECTION II. State of the Organic Muscular System during Growth. The early days of existence are marked by an interior motion as rapid as the exterior motion we have just mentioned. The sucking of the milk, the evacuation of urine, that of the meco- nium, &c., denote this interior general motion, and this almost sudden agitation in all the volun- tary muscles. It is not the brain which, being excited at birth, causes the contraction of these muscles, since, as we have said before, they are not under its influ- ence. This appears to proceed from—First, The sympathetic influence of the cutaneous organ ex- cited by a new atmosphere upon their system ; Secondly, From the excitement at the origin of all the mucous surfaces, and over the whole of that of the lungs, an excitement which subse- quently re-acts upon these muscles ; Thirdly, From that produced by the fluids entering the stomach ; Fourthly, From the sudden circulation of the red blood in every muscle, so far permeated, like every other, with dark blood: this cause is an essential one; irritability seems partly to de- pend upon it, or, at least, to borrow from it a re- markable increase of power: Fifthly, The excre- tion of the meconium and urine is also powerfullyOF ORGANIC LIFE. 479 promoted by the abdominal muscles, which, with the whole system they belong to, are then brought into action. The general interior motion which occurs in the first moments of our existence, and which is caused by the suddenly increased activity of the involuntary muscles, fulfils an important use in respect to the mucous surfaces: it rids it of the fluids it was overloaded with, the presence of which was painful. In such parts as those where- in the mucous surfaces are not surrounded with involuntary fleshy layers, as in the bronchia, the fossae nasales, &c. muscles of animal life, more or less distant, fulfil this office ; such for instance as the diaphragm, and th^ intercostals, which clear the bronchia and pituitary surfaces by coughing and sneezing. As we recede from birth, the organic muscles generally increase in a less proportion than the others: hence all the systems are gradually ba- lanced together. The predominance of the former, however, is much less striking in the. foetus than that of the nervous system. The brain, for instance, is considerably larger than the heart. i It is probable that the muscles now under con- sideration, present at that period the same varie- ties in composition as the others, that gelatine particularly predominates, that fibrine is in a small quantity, &c. At an early period, the lat- ter substance is perhaps more plentiful in theMUSCULAR SYSTEM 480 heart than in the other muscles of the same class. We have noticed two very distinct periods in the developement of these muscles; the one is completed with their growth, the other when the increase in thickness has ceased. The term of the former in organic life is not quite so strictly marked. Stature has already ceased, when the gastric and urinary organs of the heart still lengthen and expand. Growth has been considered in too general a light. In this important phenomenon each sys- tem has its peculiar time. The osseous system, the muscular system of animal life, and those de- pending upon them as the fibrous, the cartilagi- nous, &c. especially influence the general stature of the subject; but this never influences the length of the intestines, the capacity of the stomach, of the heart, of the bladder, &c.; the glandular? serous, mucous systems, &c. are also independent of stature: thus do its innumerable varieties re- late much more to the limbs than to the abdo- men, and the chest, &c. A lofty stature proclaims a predominance in the powers of locomotion, but not in those of digestion, respiration, &c. The cessation of growth in stature is merely referable to the muscles, the bones, and their appendages, and not to the internal viscera which still ex- pand. We might easily be convinced of this, by comparing the organic muscles of a youth of eighteen with those of a man of thirty and forty.OF ORGANIC LIFE. 481 The organic muscles do not seem liable to those irregularities of growth so frequently ascertained in the other muscles and in bones. We are aware that the stature will often remain stationary for some years, and then suddenly undergo a very considerable and rapid increase: this phenome- non is particularly striking subsequent to long diseases. Notwithstanding all these differences, the heart and every other analogous muscle grows uniformly; the regularity of the functions to which these muscles especially contribute would not accord with those aberrations which affect the organs of locomotion. Besides, were they to take place, circulation, digestion, the excretion of urine, &c. would be similarly affected ; but this is never observed. The heart and the gastric mus- cles keep growing whilst the size of the child re- mains stationary ; they do not suddenly increase in the youth when growth is so rapid. This ex- plains why the chest and abdomen are so spa- cious in il e first instance, in proportion to the limbs, and remain contracted in the second. Be^des, in these two systems, nutrition and power are never in equal portions. I have already observed, that very powerful organic muscles are frequently connected with a remarkable weak- * ness of the voluntary muscles, and thus recipro- cally. Let us not then consider growth and nutrition in an uniform manner. Each system has its pe- VOL. II. i j482 MUSCULAR SYSTEM culiar mode of developement and growth: two are never found equally forward, because nutri- tion, like every other act over which life pre- sides, depends essentially upon the vital powers, and these powers vary in each system. The increase of the involuntary muscular sys- tem is not uniform in all the organs that concur to its formation. Each grows more or less, or is differently developed ; the one frequently predo- minates over the other in a very remarkable manner; a bladder, with very strong fibres, is often met with in a subject whose stomach is weak, whose intestines are small, &c.; and reciprocally, the stomach, the heart, &c. are frequently seen to predominate individually. section in. State of the Organic Muscular System subsequent to Growth. ) > Towards the twenty-fourth or twenty-sixth year, the organic muscles have attained their full growth. Then the chest and the abdomen that contain them have acquired th§ir utmost ca- pacity : these organs are what they must remain for life ; they have a degree of density much su- perior to that of youth ; their powers are in- creased, their hue is deeper. This hue is in gene- ral liable to numerous varieties in the heart,OF ORGANIC LIFK. 483 which variations rather correspond with those in the preceding system. Acute and chronic dis- eases have nearly the same influence upon them ; it also indicates, by its different shades, the san- guine and lymphatic constitutions, &c. The co- lour of the fibres of the stomach, of the intestines, and of the bladder, is less variable ; their general whitish aspect is less influenced by disease. We cannot, by habitual exercise, increase the nutrition of organic muscles. Excessive reple- tion, by causing the stomach to contract, fre- qently weakens the muscles instead of strength- ening them, as is the case when the limbs are kept in continued action : the bladder inces- santly acting in peculiar incontinencies, gradually weakens and loses its energy. It may be said these two systems are in quite a reverse state in this respect. It appears that the nutrition of organic mus- cles, as well as that of others, is liable to frequent variations, that sometimes they are better characte- rized, and at other times less so than usual. Diseases have a remarkable influence upon this phenome- non, which, as well as the softening of bones and their return to their natural order, proves the ha- bitual composition and decomposition carried on in our organs. In respect to the hue, density and cohesion of muscles, a thousand varieties are daily seen in our dissecting rooms. Now all the varie- ties we see at once, one individual has often expe- i i 2 /484 MUKCULAK SYSTKM rienced successively. At one period the heart is undoubtedly red, dense, voluminous, and well nourished in the same subject; or feeble, pale, and less voluminous at another, according to the circumstances by which he is influenced ; for the internal organs necessarily undergo the same al- terations we observe in the external ones, and we are well aware how very frequent these changes are during life. SECTION VI. State of the Organic Muscular System in Old Age. In proportion as age advances, the muscular system, we are now considering, decays like every other; its action, however, is rather longer con- tinued, it survives the other, as it were. When i the aged subject can no longer move without dif- ficulty, his pulse, digestion, &c. still retain some energy. This distinction between the two sys- tems is so much the more remarkable, that the duration of activity in the one is reduced to nearly half to that of the other ; sleep, in fact, suppresses half of the period of motion in the vo- luntary motions, whilst it has no influence upon the others. This phenomenon of one muscular sys- tem surviving the other, as it were, at the decline of life, depends upon the same principle from485 OF ORGANIC LIFE. *1 1 which, in a smaller scale, proceeds the weariness that attends the contraction of an isolated mus- cle. Less continued motion is required to fatigue the voluntary than the involuntary muscles. An empty stomach remains long contracted, without imparting any painful sensation, whilst, by grasp- ing any body for a quarter of an hour only, every flexor will very soon be painfully affected. Subsequent to a convulsion that has lasted half an hour, and stiffened every muscle belonging to locomotion, the whole frame is bruised, according to the vulgar expression : it admits of no motion : whilst after a fever of six or eight hours, during which the pulse has been violently agitated, the heart will often retain the natural type of its contractions; to weaken this organ requires a succession of fits. All these phenomena of the two muscular systems, evidently prove, that that of animal life is much sooner wearied ; this even causes intermission. Why should we wonder then, if although less active than the other, it sooner expends the sum of power nature has bestowed upon it ? Is it astonishing this should survive the last? Life is a grand exercise that, by degrees, destroys the moving organs, and finally com- mands rest ; that rest is death : each moveable organ dies sooner or later, according to the pow- ers which it has to expend, according to its greater or less tendency to be wearied by that exercise.486 JV1USCIJLAK SYSTLM-. The organic muscles, however, gradually de- cay. The pulse becomes slower, and digestion requires more time in the elderly subject; the bladder and the rectum first cease to act, then the intestines become inactive in turn ; the sto- mach, and more particularly the heart, dies the last. Long before death, the muscular cohesion de* cays in this as in the preceding system ; the fleshy tissue grows flabby: in youth the parieties of the heart are supported by their own powers, they sink down in old age. The gastric system of a young animal killed during hunger, is firm, dense, and contracted ; in an old one, in similar circum- stances, it is but indifferently contracted: the stomach and the intestines, remain much more di- lated, they are loose and soft: this phenomenon is similar to that of the preceding muscles, which, for want of cohesion, quiver under the skin. The bladder constantly remains distended, though void of urine, &c.MUCOUS SYSTEM. This system, the name of which I borrow from the fluid with which it is habitually lubricated, and which flows from small glands belonging to its structure, displays in all parts the form of a mem.' brane; it is never met with in fasciculi. In treating of the mucous organs, we shall then most gene- rally describe them under the name of mem- branes. Their study is quite a new object of re- search. Vinel was one of the first who felt the necessity of considering them in a general light in respect to diseases. I am the first, I believe, who has taken a similar view of their anatomical and physiological character. Few systems are more deserving of our attention ; upon this all the important phenomena of digestion, respira- tion, secretions, excretions, &c. depend, and it is the seat of many diseases. In a nosography in which diseases should be classed according to systems, this should occupy a space equal to several.MUCOUS SYSTEM. 488 ARTICLE I. Di visions and Forms of the Mucous System. The mucous membranes line the interior of the cavities that communicate with the skin through the different apertures which this envelope pre- sents on the surface of the body. These, at the first view, appear very considerable; for the organs within from which they are reflected, are very numerous. The mouth, the stomach, the intestines, the oesophagus, the bladder, the ure- thra, the uterus, the ureters, all the excretory ducts, <fcc. &c. partly borrow their structure from these membranes. If we consider, however, that they are every where continuous, that they are always seen arising from and connected with each other at their origin from the skin, we shall find that their number is remarkably li- mited. In fact, considering them in this manner, and not individually, but including in a same glance all those parts in which they are conti- nued, we find them confined to two general sur- faces, of which the others form divisions, and which, in respect to the different parts to which they are distributed, we may designate the gas- tro-pulmonary and the genito-urinary. The former belongs to the head, neck, and the abdo- men, the latter to the urinary bladder, and more particularly to the pelvis.MCCOUS SYSTEM. 489 There is also another small isolated mucous surface; that which lines the openings in the nipple and the lacteal tubes ; but it is too trifling to me- rit much of our attention: besides, what will be said of the others is also applicable to this, and it would therefore be useless to examine it in a general light. section i. Of the Two general Mucous Membranes, Gastro* Pulmonary and Genito- Urinary. The gastro-pulmonary surface enters through the mouth, the nose, and the anterior part of the eye ; 1st. It lines these two first cavities, extend- ing from the one to the excretory tubes of the parotid and of the sub-maxillary glands : from the other extending to all the sinuses, it forms the tunica conjunctiva, plunges into the punctae lachrymalae, the nasal canal and sac, and is conti- nued in the nose; 2dly. It descends into the pharynx, and supplies the Eustachian tube from this, and as we shall perceive, lines the internal ear; 3dly. It enters the trachea and extends through the air tubes; 4thly. It penetrates the oesophagus and stomach ; 5thly. It extends to the duodenum, wherein it divides into two parts, the one intended for the ductus choledocust the numerous ramusculse of the hepatic and cystic ducts, and the gall bladder, the other for the490 MUCOUS SYSTEM. pancreatic duct and its different branches; Gthly. It is continued through the large and small intes- tines, and finally terminates in the anus, where it is identified with the skin. The second general mucous membrane, that we have called genito-urinary, penetrates in man through the urethra, and from thence is distributed on the one part over the bladder, the ureters, the pelvis of the kidnies, the infundibula, the papil- lae, and the capillary tubes, that open at their summit; on the other part it enters the excretory tubes of the prostate gland, the ejaculatory ducts, the vesiculae seminales, the vasa deferen- tia, and the innumerable folds from which they originate. In the female this membrane enters the vulva, and continuing on the one part through the ure- thra, is extended, as in man, over the urinary organs ; on the other part it is seen to enter and line the vagina, as well as the uterus and fallo- pean tubes, and is subsequently continued with the peritoneum through the aperture of these tubes. This is the only instance, in the economy , of a communication between the mucous and serous surfaces. This manner of describing the course assumed by the mucous surfaces, by saying, they enter into, are continued with, &c. from one cavity to another, is certainly not conformable to the course that nature follows, which creates in everyMUCOUS SYSTEM. 491 organ the membranes intended for that organ, and does not thus extend them from one to an- other ; but our manner of conceiving them is better accommodated to this language, which on the slightest reflection will be sufficiently intelli- gible. By thus referring the mucous surfaces to two general membranes, I am not only supported by anatomical inspection, but pathological observa- tion also draws the same line of distinction, and discloses points of contact between the different % portions of these membranes. In the divers ta- bles of epidemic catarrhs, drawn by authors, the whole of one of these membranes is frequently seen affected, whilst the others remain perfectly healthy : it is not uncommon to observe a general affection in the former, in that which extends from the mouth, the nose, and the surface of the eye, to the alimentary canal and the bronchiae. The last epidemic observed at Paris, and with which Pinel was affected, was of this nature, as well as that of 1761, described by Razon ; and the epidemic of 1752, related in the Memoirs of the Society of Edinburgh, was remarkable for a similar phenomenon, but no corresponding affec- tion was then observed in the mucous membrane, which is distributed through the urinary organs and those of generation. Here then we find ; 1st. Analogy between the different parts of the first in the uniformity of the affection; 2dly. AMUCOUS SYSTEM. 492 difference between the two, the one being in a dis- eased and the other in a healthy state. It is also observed, that irritation in any part of one of these membranes frequently causes pain in another point of the same membrane that has not been irritated. Thus a stone in the blad- der causes pain at the extremity of the glands; the presence of worms in the intestines produces itching in the nose, &c. &c. Now these phe- nomena are merely sympathetic, for the partial irritation of either of these membranes will affect any part of the other: there are, however, in- stances of it; such as the singular consent ex- isting in mucous discharges, between the mem- brane of the uterus and that of the bronchia. If, during the periodical discharge, the blood acci- dentally ceases to flow from the one, this fluid is often exhaled from the other, which acts as a sub- stitute, as it were, for the former. From inspection and observation, we ought then to consider the mucous surface in general as being formed by two large membranes distributed over several organs, communicating together by the skin only, which is placed between them, and which being continued with both, contributes to form a general membrane every where continued, covering the animal externally, and extended within over its more essential parts. It will be easily conceived, that there must exist an import- ant connection between the interior and exteriorMUCOUS SYSTEM. 493 parts of this membrane ; and this, in fact, is what further enquiry will prove. SECTION II. Adherent Surface of th e Mucous Membrane. Every mucous membrane presents two sur- faces, the one adhering to the adjacent organs, the other free, covered with villi, and constantly moistened with a mucous fluid. Each of these claim a particular notice. The adherent surface almost every where corre- sponds to the muscles of animal or of organic life. The mouth, the larynx, the whole of the alimen- tary canal, the bladder, the vagina, the womb, a part of the urethra, &c. present muscular layers, which inclose their mucous membrane. This perfectly coincides, in animals possessed of a fleshy panniculus, with that of the skin, which also approaches in some degree the structure of the mucous membranes, and which, as we have already seen, is every where continued with them. It maintains them in constant motion, by which their secretion, the excretion that succeeds to it, and the various other functions which these or- gans are intended to perform. The insertion of this muscular layer, exterior to the mucous sys- tem, is effected by that dense and tight tissue I have named submucous. It is from this compact494 MUCOUS SYSTEM. tissue the mucous surface derives its force. On this the organ it invests is moulded ; it both fixes and maintains its form, as the following experi- ment proves. If we strip from any part of the intestines a little of this as well as of the serous and muscular layers, and inflate it after having tied the lower end, the air will produce a hernia in this part of the mucous membrane. If on the other hand we remove a small point of the mucous and submucous membranes, the same effect is pro- duced by inflation, with the serous and muscular coats, as in the preceding case with respect to the mucous coat. To this submucous cellular layer, the organ is then indebted for the resistance it opposes to the substances it contains, and the same remark applies also to the stomach, the bladder, the oesophagus, &c. SECTION III. Free Surface of the Mucous Membranes. In the free surfaces of the mucous membranes that are habitually lubricated by the fluid from which they borrow their name, three kinds of pleats or folds are observed. 1st. Those belonging to the structure of all the layers of these membranes, are constantly met with, whatever may be their state of dilatation or contraction : such are those of the pylorus and495 MUCOUS SYSTEM. of Bauhin’s valve. These folds are not only formed by the mucous membrane, but also by the interposed tunic we have mentioned, and which assumes in this part a remarkable thickness and density that insures their solidity. The fleshy tunic even enters into their composition, and their presence is known by an exterior depression over the serous surface. 2dly, Other folds, exclusively formed by the mucous surface, are also permanent, either in the state of plenitude or in that of vacuity, but less evidently than these; they proceed from the mu- cous surface being much more extensive than those over which they are applied ; so that it is folded to afford a more ample surface in the same space : such are the valvulae conniventes of the small intestines, the structure of which may be clearly ascertained, by dividing one of these or- gans in a longitudinal direction. The edges of the section show the fleshy layer and the serous surface straight in their courses, whilst the mu- cous layer describes a line not unlike a twining thread. 3dly. The third species of folds is accidental, as it were ; they are never observed but during the contraction of the organ, that is lined by the mucous surface in which they are formed; such are those of the interior of the stomach, of the 1 large intestines, &c. In the greatest number of subjects brought to our dissecting rooms, these 'MUC0U8 SYSTEM. 496 folds of the stomach so much talked of can sel- dom be traced, because generally the subject has died from some affection, which has so far weakened his vital powers, as to prevent all kind of action in that organ ; so that, although frequently found empty, its fibres are not at all contracted. In experiments on living animals on the contrary, these folds are made very strik- ing, by adopting the following method:—In- stantly a dog has taken a copious quantity of food and drink, open the animal, and cut into the stomach in the direction of its longest curve : no folds are then to be seen : but the viscus soon contracts ; the edges fall backwards ; the food is thrown out; the whole mucous surface is co- vered with a multiplicity of irregular promi- nences and wrinkles not unlike the convolutions of the brain. The same result might be obtained by tearing away the stomach from an animal re- cently killed, inflating and then dividing it, or rather by dividing it immediately when empty, and drawing it out by its edges ; it extends, the wrinkles disappear, and if the distension be dis- continued, they are instantly produced in a very conspicuous manner. With regard to inflating the stomach, I have observed, that by distending it with oxygen, stronger wrinkles, and conse- quently more powerful contractions are not ob- tained by the contact of this gas, than by em- ploying the carbonic acid gas for the same pur-497 MUCOUS SYSTEM. pose. From this experiment an effect is produced nearly similar to that I have seen on causing emphysema by means of different aerial fluids. From what has been said respecting the wrinkles of the mucous membranes, it follows, that in the natural contractions of the hollow organs lined with these membranes, their surface is not much reduced, that they scarcely contract, but fold in- wardly, so that on separating them from the or- gan, in a state of contraction, the surface is nearly equal in extent to that which exists when the organ is dilated. This assertion is perfectly cor- rect in what regards the stomach, the oesophagus, and the large intestines, but it may perhaps not he quite so applicable to the bladder, the interior of which presents smaller wrinkles during contraction, but sufficiently strong not to deviate from the ge- neral law. It is almost the same thing in regard to the gall bladder : here, however, we find another cause. If alternately observed during hunger, and during digestion, the gall bladder will contain double the quantity of bile in the former state, a fact which I have frequently noticed in experi- ments made with this and other views. Now whenever the gall bladder is partly emptied, it does not contract over the remaining bile, with that energy the stomach will, when it contains but little food, or with the same force as the blad- der when filled with little fluid only. The lat- ter then is flabby ; so that its distension or vol. n. K KMUCOUS SYSTEM. 498 relaxation has but little influence upon its mucous membrane. Besides, in saying the mucous membranes (ad- mitting only of very few distinctions), constantly display the same surface in the extension as when contracted—I merely mean in the ordinary state of these functions, and not in those enormous dila- tations often produced in the stomach, the blad- der, and in the intestines, though not quite so fre- quently in the latter. There is actually real ex- tension and contraction, which in the membrane coincide with those of the organ. A remarkable observation we are led to form in respect to the free surface of the mucous mem- branes, and to which I have already alluded, is, that this surface is every where in contact with bodies heterogeneous to that of the animal, whe- ther these bodies admitted from without, for nu- trition, are not yet assimilated to this substance, is seen in the alimentary canal and in the t trachea, or that they proceed from within, as is observed in the excretory tubes of the glands, all of which open into cavities lined with mucous membranes, and transmit the particles, which af- ter having contributed for some time to the com- position of solids, become heterogeneous, and are separated from them by that habitual motion of composition and decomposition incessantly conti- nued in living bodies. From this observation, the mucous membranes should be considered as limits,499 MUCOUS SYSTEM. as barriers, which being intermediate to our or- gans, and the substances foreign to them, protect them from the fatal impressions of these bodies, and consequently fulfil, inwardly, the same office the skin performs without, in respect to the bodies that surround that of the animal, and which in- cessantly tend to act upon him. The organization of the mucous system, in common with its vital properties, are accommo- dated to that habitual contact of substances he- terogeneous to the living economy. What may be foreign to other systems, to the cellular, the mus- cular, &c. is not so to this. The solid substances, metals, stones, wood, &c. which, on entering our parts unavoidably produce, by their contact, only suppuration or inflammation, will pass over this with impunity, provided it is not lacerated by their points, or their asperities ; they merely, as I shall state, rather increase their secretion. A ball of lead, of wood, &c. may be swallowed, and will be expelled with the faeces without injury. All irritating fluids that are not caustic, conveyed in the large intestines by injections, or even swallowed, would produce suppuration, if they were forced into the cellular system, <fcc. Sur- geons use the words, foreign bodies, in too general a manner, for whatever might be foreign to one system is not so to another. Foreign is, in this respect, a word of comparison, which ought only to be used with a perfect knowledge of the de- < k k 2500 ' MUCOUS SYSTEM. gree of sensibility peculiar to each system, and not from this property being considered in an in- definite manner. Not only the mucous system bears without danger the contact of all substances that are ad- mitted into the economy, but also whenever it is forced outward, it may, without injury, be ex- posed to external stimulants. Let us only ob- serve what takes place in prolapsus uteri, when the whole membrane of the vagina is sometimes forced out in eversions of the intestinal canal, in the artificial anus, in falls upon the rectum, &c. Then the mucous surfaces actually fill the office of inte- guments, but surrounding bodies do not act more painfully upon them than upon the skin. On the contrary, the moment a serous surface is laid bare, as in the operation of hernia for instance, wherein the intestine is exposed in consequence of an opening accidentally made by the point of the knife, this surface unavoidably inflames. All the cellular, muscular, nervous, or glandular parts, &c. laid bare, present the very same phenome- non ; the opening of the bladder is, in respect to the contact of air, unattended with danger, whilst the utmost danger would exist in suffer- ing this fluid to penetrate an articulating cavity, a tendinous sheath, a serous bag, &c. We are aware how necessary it is to avoid wounding the peritoneum in the high operation- for the stone ; how uncertain is the result of emphysema,MUCOUS SYSTEM. 501 from the admission of air to the pleura, &c. The dangers attending the action of this fluid upon these organs, may have been too much exagge- rated, but they are nevertheless real. Whenever a fistula penetrates the intestines, its whole course is covered with callosities, by which the cellular tissue, and the muscles that cross the fistula, are protected. Nothing similar to this, on the contrary, is ever observed over the . mucous surface of the intestines, because its orga- nization alone is sufficient to protect it. The urinary, salivary and lachrymal fluids will never flow outwardly through artificial passages in the adjacent organs, without' similar callosities form in the course of these ducts; on the contrary, they traverse the mucous surfaces with impunity. If with a cutting instrument, we make a long, nar- row opening in one of the extremities, and fix a tube within it, the presence of the instrument will produce a canal formed of callosities; but if, on _ • the contrary, a bougie be retained in the urethra, no alteration in the tissue will take place. From these considerations, let us conclude that the mucous system only, in common, however, with the cutaneous, is so organized as to bear the contact of all exterior forms, and not to be affected by their presence, or at least to experi- ence from it only an increase of secretion wholly unattended with danger. Thus these two systems form two limits, the one internal, the other ex- 9 teinal, limits between which the organs, foreignMUCOUS SYSTEM* 502 by their mode of sensibility and their structure to exterior forms, are interposed. To these limits the excitation of these forms stop; their influ- ence can never exceed them ; as long as they ex- tend to them only the other organs are unaffected by them. We might suppose that the exquisite sensibility with which each is endowed, is a sen- try, as it were, nature has placed on the bounda- ries of the organic empire of the soul, to warn it of approaching danger. ARTICLE II. Organization of the Mucous System, SECTION i. Tissue proper to that Organization. Two things in the tissue proper to the mucous system are still to be considered, namely ; 1st. A layer of greater or less thickness forming the principal constituent part of this tissue, and which, through analogy with the cutaneous co- rion, may be named mucous corion; 2dly. A multiplicity of small projections from its surface, called villi or papillae. As to the epidermis it is covered with, it shall be noticed when treating of the cutaneous epidermis. This tissue has not the slightest similitude with the colouring substance of the skin, interposed between the papillae and the epidermis. In fact, it is sufficiently known, that in black, as well as in white subjects, this tissue is of a very bright red colour which it bor- rows from the blood vessels.MUCOUS SYSTEM 503 Mucous Corion, The thickness of the mucous corion admits of very considerable varieties ; in this respect it va- ries in every organ : that of the gums and palate is the thickest of all: then come in turn those of the fossae nasales and of the stomach, subsequently those of the small intestines and of the gall blad- der ; then again in succession those of the large in- testines of the urinary bladder, of the urethra, and other excretory organs, on reaching which it be- comes thin so as to resemble, on being carefully removed, a serous surface. Finally. The thinnest and most delicate of these divisions, is that which lines the sinuses of the face and the interior of the ear, the tunica arachnoides is often much coarser. I speak of the mucous tissue of the internal ear, notwithstanding that every anatomist has given it the name of periosteum. In fact ; 1st. This tissue is evidently seen continued with the pi- tuitary membrane, through the prolongation of the eustachian tube; 2dly. It is habitually found moistened with a mucous fluid outwardly ex- pelled through this canal, a character inapplicable to the periosteum, which, like every other fibrous membrane, adheres constantly at both surfaces; 3dly. No fibre can be traced in it ; 4thly. Its fungous appearance, although whitish and loose, the facility with which it is lacerated at the slightest attempt, are certainly properties of the mucous membranes. Every thing then contri-MUCOUS SYSTEM. £04* butes to prove that the membrane of the cavity, tnat of the fallopean tube, &c. belong to the sys- tem we are considering: hence in catarrhal affec- tions of the pituitary membrane and the back part of the mouth, the ear is often implicated : hence the ear, as well as the mucous surfaces, is frequently the seat of hemorrhage, and polypi originate from it, as they do from the nose and surface of the womb. Every discharge from the ear has been considered as proceeding from a collection in that cavity. But how, in a part hardly possessed of any cellular tissue at all, in a part completely composed of bones, could a ga- thering of pus be conceived ? Besides, as we are perfectly aware, the fibrous system to which the periosteum of this part should belong, will hardly ever admit of suppuration. Every thing then leads to a belief that these discharges are nothing more than the produce of an auricular catarrh, some- times of an acute, at other times a chronic type* I have besides a recent and decisive fact on this head. I have observed in a subject liable to such discharges during life, a remarkable redness and thickness in the membrane of the tympanum, but not the slightest sign of erosion. The ear sup- purates as the urethra, the vagina, &c.: it is not a new fluid formed by suppuration, it is the same which naturally flows through the tube, which being increased in quantity, is accidentally ex- pelled through an outlet in the membrane of the tympanum.MUCOUS SYSTEM. 505 The thickness of all the mucous surfaces is re- markably increased by disease.* In the maxillary sinus I have seen it very considerably increased, and attain the thickness of half an inch in the bladder, &c. In considerable distensions of the mucous bags this thickness is very much reduced, it increases on their contracting ; the stomach in particular presents this phenomenon in these two reverse states. The softness of the mucous corion also varies astonishingly; in the fossae nasales, in the stomach, and in the intestines, it is actually a kind of or- ganized velvet. The name of velvety membrane is perfectly applicable wherever the mucous sys- tem originates; on the contrary, in the mouth, over the glands, in the nostrils, the tissue is denser and tighter, and by its nature approaches more the cutaneous corion; I am convinced that it would admit of being tanned, and much advan- tage might be derived from its use in our manufac- tories, if its surfaces were more extensive ; whilst I very much doubt of this process could pro- duce a similar phenomenon on the mucous tissue of organs deeply situate ; its softness would make it unfit to act as exterior ligaments; the slightest attempt, in fact, would be sufficient to rupture and lacerate it. The difference between its struc- ture with that of the cutaneous corion, prevents, in small-pox, the pustules from forming over them, whilst they are frequently met with over/ 606 MUCOUS SYSTEM. the mucous surfaces near to the openings of the skin, especially over the tongue, the palate, and the internal surface of the cheeks. Exposed to the action of dry air, so that it may be penetrated on all sides, the mucous corion dries, grows very thin, but retains some degree , of resistance. When the bladder is dried and in- flated, or the stomach, intestines, &c. have un- dergone a similar preparation, it is this tissue that prevents the organs from sinking, although air has been suffered to escape ; from its resistance, even on attempting to bend it in different ways, a crackling noise is produced; to ascertain this, let the mucous surface be dried separately from the serous and muscular layers that correspond to it; these, when dried, will remain supple as well as the cellular tissue, whilst the former will retain a kind of rigidity. In organs of which the mucous tissue is rather pale, as the bladder, the rectum, &c. this tissue becomes transparent on drying ; when of a deep red, as in the stomach, if a considerable quantity of blood has been accumulating by preceding inflammation, it assumes a deep colour, even blackish, as it were ; whence it appears that this fluid is the source of colour. Thus dried, the mucous surfaces are smooth ; they appear to have lost their viscidity ; their folds sink into the parts from which they origi- nate : thus, on a dried intestine, the valvulae con-MUCOUS SYSTEM. 50? niventes are merely marked by a reddish line, without any apparent projection ; but if the in- testine, when in that state be submitted to mace- ration, the folds will again expand. On being exposed to damp air, or left amongst other animal remains that prevent it from dry- ing, the mucous corion very soon becomes putrid ; its smell in that state is very offensive. If the abdomen soon putrifies, it is not only owing, I should think, to its containing putrid substances, but also to the surfaces being in contact with those substances which, by their vitality, had so far resisted their influence. If these substances were contiguous to aponeurosis, putrefaction would not be near so rapid during this process: the mucous system first assumes a greyish hue; and as the subjacent dense cellular tissue requires much more time to putrify, this mucous corion can be elevated with the greatest facility, and re- duced to a putrid mass, in which there are no re- mains of organization. During life, the mucous tissue is in general less frequently affected with gangrene than the cutaneous tissue. The consequences attending catarrhs, compared with those of erysipelas, will convince us of this truth. There are instances, however, of this tissue becoming dead, whilst the surrounding parts continue to live, as in malig- nant sore throat. The mucous tissue readily yields. I even be-508 MUCOUS SYSTEM. lieve, that after the brain, this is the soonest af- fected by the action of water. It is reduced to a reddish pulp, very different from that produced by exposure to pure air. When a whole stomach is submitted to maceration, this pulp becomes detached before the submucous tissue and the serous membrane have hardly undergone the slightest alteration. A greenish skin, very diffe- rent from that obtained when the muscular and cellular tissues are boiled, is first extracted from the mucous tissue by the same process. This skum, when mixed with the whole fluid at the com- mencement of ebullition, at first thickens the water and gives it a greenish appearance, subse- quently rises over its surface, where it is found to contain but very few particles of air, frequently even it sinks by its own weight. Its colour is changed to a dark brown by sulphuric acid. Just before the water boils, the mucous tissue twists and shrinks in the same manner as the others, but in a less degree. The sub-mucous tissue over which it is applied, shrinking much more, this of necessity must contract to be of equal length : thus during life, when the fleshy layer of the stomach contracts, its mucous surface not con- tracting proportionally, produces the innumera- ble folds we have mentioned. The sub-mucous tissue shrinking much more than the mucous tis- sue, by the agency of concentrated acid, produces a similar phenomenon. After having been driedMUCOUS SYSTEM. 509 for some length of time, the mucous tissue, like almost every other in the economy, does not lose the power of shrinking the moment it is im- mersed in boiling water. This phenomenon is produced, either when in a dry state, or after it has been softened by cold water. By this means the valvulae conniventes are immediately repro- duced, an experiment that is very interesting. When ebullition has been continued for some time, the mucous tissue, white at first, gradually acquires a very deep grey colour. It is not softer than in the natural state, but is much sooner la- cerated, as is proved by the following experi- ment :—When the mucous corion, united to the subjacent cellular tissue, has been gently boiled, the latter resists much longer, and thus remains entire, whilst the mucous tissue has already been parted in several places. This corion never puts on that gelatinous appearance peculiar to the cu- taneous, to the fibrous, cartilaginous, and other ogans which yield abundance of gelatine. By mixing, however, a solution of tan with the water in which this system, selected from an adult subject, has been boiled, I have observed, an evi- dent precipitation. By the action of acids, the mucous tissue is re- duced to a pulp much sooner than the others. During life, caustics act more rapidly upon this membrane than upon the skin, whose epidermis being thick, prevents it from combining with510 MUCOUS SYSTEM. its corion. Thus, the moment the nitric acid, a substance most generally used as a poison by the lower class, (as it is sufficiently proved by the practice of the Hotel Dieu); the moment, 1 say, the nitric acid comes in contact with the ali- mentary passages, they are disorganized by it ; it causes a white escar, which, when death (as is most frequently the case) is not an immediate consequence, is slowly removed and separated in the form of a membrane. We are well aware, that being slightly rubbed with very dilute nitric acid, the lips are affected by an insupportable throbbing, whilst frequently no pain is expe- rienced, although that acid has so effectually acted upon the skin, as to dye its exterior surface of a yellow colour. The softness of the mucous corion induces me to believe it is easily affected by the gastric juices; not that I credit Hunter’s experiments on this head, who pretends these juices are power- ful enough to corode even the very membrane that produces them ; but because I have noticed, that every tissue which like this readily yields to maceration, is also very easily digested. I have, besides, no experiment to produce in re- spect to this tissue, and we are perfectly aware, that in the animal economy analogy is not al- ways a safe guide. Every mucous surface, but particularly those of the stomach and intestines, have the property511 MUCOUS SYSTEM, of curding milk, in the same manner as many other substances have,—acids in particular. Should we attribute to this property a phenomenon in- variable during life, namely, the coagulation of milk, the moment it enters the stomach ? or does this phenomenon proceed from the mixture of this fluid with those which are separated on the surface of that organ ? I believe they both ope- rate simultaneously; individually, in fact, they both produce the phenomenon. Spallanzani has ascertained it, in respect to the gastric juices. We / know that when dried, and divested consequently of these juices, the mucous membrane retains the property of curding milk. Spallanzani has also convinced himself, that the serous and organic muscular systems of the stomach, do not possess this property. Are apthae an affection of the mucous corion ? Do they belong to the papillae ? Have they their seat in glands, whilst catarrhs are characterized by a general inflammation of the mucous system of some considerable extent ? These questions require a further consideration. Pinel was fully sensible that pathological anatomy was deficient in this respect. Mucous Papillae. The peculiar mode of sensibility the skin en- joys, is chiefly attributed, as is sufficiently known.MUCOUS SYSTEM. 612 to what are called the papillae,—bodies which commonly are not very easily demonstrated. The sensibility of the mucous membranes, rather simi- lar to that of the skin, appears to me to claim the same mode of organization which here is much better perceived. The origin of the papil- lae in this system cannot be doubted, where it enters the cavities, and in the openings even of these cavities; as upon the tongue over the palate, in the internal parts of the alias nasi, over the glands, in the fossa navicularis, inside of the lips, &c., is proved by mere inspection. But the question is, whether there are also papillae in the more remote parts of this system. Analogy shows that this is the case, since sensibility is as perfect in these parts as in their origin, although it ad- mits of varieties which shall be explained, but which are not less clearly proved by inspection. I believe that the villi they are, without exception, covered wrth, are nothing but papillae. Very different ideas have been conceived of these villi. In the oesophagus and stomach, they have been considered as intended for the exhala- tion of the gastric juices, in the intestines, as the agents of the absorption of chyle, &c. But, 1st. It cannot be easily conceived how an organ, every where nearly similar, should perform in all the different parts functions so very distinct: I say nearly similar; for these bodies, as will be seen, varying in their dimensions, and without513 MUCOUS SYSTEM. varying, neither in tissue or in structure ; 2dly* What could be the functions of the villi, of the pituitary membrane, of the lining of the urethra, bladder, &c. if they are not connected with the sensibility of these membranes? 3dly. The micro- scopic experiments of Leiberkuhn, respecting the bubble of the intestinal villi, have been con- tradicted by those of Hunter and Cruikshanks, and particularly by those of Hewson. As to myself, I can affirm that I have never seen any thing similar over the surface of the small intes- tines at the moment chyle was absorbed ; and it appears to me, that what relates to inspection should never vary ; 4thly. It is true that these intestinal villi are every where attended with a vascular net-work, from which they borrow a hue very distinct from the colour of the cutane- ous papillse : but the non-appearance of the cu- taneous net-work proceeds from the pressure of atmospheric air, and particularly from the dry- ness it produces in the small vessels. In fact, only see the foetus the moment it leaves the mo- ther’s womb ; its skin is as red as the mucous mem- branes, and if the papillse were rather more pro- minent, it would almost perfectly resemble the internal surface of the intestines. Who, besides, is not perfectly aware that the vascular net- work, investing the cutaneous papillse, is ren- dered very evident by liquid injections, so effec- tually as even to change the hue completely ?

That in the stomach this vascular net-work is continued with the exhalants, and pours out the gastric juices; that in the intestines it interweaves with the origin of the absorbants which encom- pass these villi, is what can no longer be doubted from the experiments and observations of anato- mists, who of late have given the lymphatic sys- tem a special consideration. But all this does not prevent the basis of these villi from being of a nervous nature, and from their fulfilling, in re- spect to the mucous membranes, the same func- tions as the papillae of the cutis. This manner of viewing them by explaining their existence in every mucous surface by a general observation, appears to me much more conformable with the course followed by nature, than to suppose them performing in each individual part, distinct, and frequently even quite opposite functions. The question, besides, will not be easily de- cided by ocular observation. The structure of these minute projections is concealed from the sight by their excessive tenuity, even when as- sisted by our microscopic instruments; agents from which anatomy and physiology do not seem to me to have reaped much advantage, because, whenever we look in the dark, each sees accordingly as he is prejudiced or affected. The observation then of the vital properties should guide us more particularly. Now, from such ob- servation, the villi are evidently of the nature I515 MUCOUS SYSTEM. have described. The following is an experiment I have made use of to demonstrate the influence of the papillae upon the sensibility of the cutis : it succeeds also on the mucous membranes. Let the epidermis in a part be removed, and the pa- pillae be excited with a sharp stylet; the animal will flutter, cry, and express the utmost pain ; then let a similar instrument be introduced into the sub- cutaneous cellular tissue, through a smaller open- ing in the skin, and the internal surface of the corion be irritated; the animal remains quiet, and gives no signs of pain, unless some nervous filaments have accidentally been injured by the instrument. From this it is evident, that the sensibility of the skin resides in its external sur- face ; that the nerves cross the corion without contributing to its texture, and that they only expand over the papillse : it is the very same thing in respect to the mucous surfaces. Let it be re- marked, that this circumstance perfectly coincides with the functions of each of these surfaces, which receive through their free part the impressions of external bodies, which their under surface has no connection with. The papilla© display innumerable varieties. Upon the tongue, in the intestines, the stomach, and in the gall bladder, they are remarkable for their length. Less so in the oesophagus, in the large in- testines, in the bladder, and in every excretory or- gan ; indeed, in the latter, and particularly in the L I, 2516 MUCOUS SYSTEM. urethra, they are nearly smooth in the whole ex- tent of their mucous surface. In the frontal, sphcenoidal, and maxillary sinuses, &c. the pa- pillae are hardly perceptible. Over the tongue these small nervous projec lions are rather distinct and tolerably distant from each other. In the fossee nasales, stomach, and intestines, they are so close to each other, and at the same time so very minute, that the mem- brane bears at first glance an uniform aspect, smooth as it were, although covered with these projections. Each papilla is formed of a single body ; their extremities are never seen divided. All apparently have a pyramidal form, if we are to judge of all by the most sensitive. Do they admit of a kind of erection ? This opinion has prevailed in regard to those of the tongue, which are said to rise to perceive fla- vours; in respect to those of the nose, which in this state of erection are supposed more effec- tually to receive odours, &c.: this, in respect to the phenomena of sensation, is, on a small scale, what the erection of the corpus'cavernosum is on a more extensive one. I do not believe this fact could possibly be proved by any experiment: besides, it should then follow that the papillae of the intestines and bladder are in a permanent state of erection, since they are almost always in contact with foreign substances.MUCOUS SYSTEM. 517 SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Mucous System. Besides the vascular, exhalant, and absorbant organs, that contribute to the structure of this system as well as of the rest, it possesses also an organ in common, most generally found isolated in every other part, but which being necessary to its functions, is more generally distributed. This organ is of a glandular nature. We shall notice it the first. Of the Mucous Glands, and of the Fluids they separate. The mucous glands exist in the whole system of that denomination. Situate below the corion, or even in its substance, they incessantly pour through imperceptible apertures, a mucilaginous fluid, that lubricates its free surface, and protects it from the impressions of the bodies with which it comes in contact, forwarding at the same time the course of these bodies. These glands are very apparent in the bronchia, the palate, the oesophagus, and the intestines: they derive their names from the anatomists who have given the best description of them, and are seen to form in different parts evident projections518 MUCOUS SYSTEM. over the mucous surface. They are not quite so apparent in the bladder, the womb, gall bladder, vesiculae seminales, <fec.; but their existence is fully proved by the mucus with which their in- ternal surface is lubricated. In fact, since on the one hand this fluid is of an analogous nature over every mucous membrane, and, on the other hand, it is evidently furnished by glands where- ever these organs are apparent, it necessarily fol- lows that it must also proceed from glands where even they are not so conspicuous. The iden- tity of the secreted fluids must imply an iden- tity of the secreting organs. It appears, that wherever these glands are concealed from the sight, nature has, by multiplying their number, compensated for their minuteness ; besides, there are animals, in which they form, by their multi- plicity over the intestines, a kind of additional layer to that mentioned before. In man, this fact is remarkable in the palate, and its appendage the velum palati, in the internal surfaces of the lips, of the cheeks, &c. &c. There is this dis- tinction then between the mucous and serous membranes, that the former are lubricated by se- cretion, the latter by exhalation. The mucous glands vary in size : the soft pa- late, &c. seem to contain the largest: this size is gradually reduced in the greatest number of the mucous surfaces. I have dissected two subjects who died from pulmonary catarrh, in whom those519 MUCOUS SYSTEM. of the trachea and bronchia were not increased in size, although, as it is well known, they are ra- ther conspicuous: the membrane alone seemed affected. Besides, the affections of these glands have not yet (as those of similar organs, more apparent from their volume) been properly in- vestigated. In general they assume a spherical form, but with innumerable varieties. They do not seem to be enveloped by any membrane whatever : like the salivary glands, and the pan- creatic, they are supported by cellular tissue. Their texture is tighter and denser than that of these last glands; they contain but little cellular tissue; they are soft and vascular, and on being opened, their appearance is nearly similar to that of the prostrate gland. I cannot tell if they con- tain any nerves; by analogy we must suppose it, for all the principal glands are supplied with these organs. Mucous Fluids. We are but imperfectly acquainted with the composition of the mucous fluids, because, in the natural state they cannot easily be collected, and in the morbid state, wherein their quantity is increased, as in catarrhs for instance, their com- position is probably altered. It is well known, that in general they are flat and insipid to the taste, not easily dissolved by water, even when that fluid is raised to a very high degree of tern-520 MUCOUS SYSTEM. perature ; they require much time to become pu- trid ; in fact, they remain for a long time unaf- fected in the nose, exposed to the action of damp air; the putrid matter of the intestines is quite inoffensive to them, &c. When removed from the body, and undergoing various experiments, their results are conformable to these facts. All acids act upon them, they are variously coloured by these substances ; exposed to dry air, they thicken by evaporation, and are even frequently reduced to small layers of a brilliant aspect. The mucus of the nose in particular displays this phenome- non. Fourcroy has published a very circumstan- tial analysis of this mucus ; to which he has also added that of the trachea. But what we know respecting the composition of these, should not, howTever, be strictly applied to similar fluids. It will be sufficient, in fact, to examine a certain number of these fluids, to perceive they are not twice the same, that they, more or less thick, or less permanent, differing in their hue, even in their smell, &c. they must necessarily vary in their constituent principles, as the membranes that produce them vary in their structures, in the number and volume of their glands, in the thick- ness of their corion, in the forms of their papillae, in the state of their vascular and nervous systems, &c. I am far from maintaining that the gastric juice is a mucous one ; it is even probable it is produced by exhalation, the glands of the sto-521 MUCOUS SYSTEM. mach emitting a distinct fluid by the way of se- cretiou: but this assertion is not substantially demonstrated, and at some future time it may be proved, that this juice, so very different from other mucous juices, is, however, a mucous juice, differing in properties only, because the structure of the mucous surface of the stomach differs from that of all other similar surfaces. The functions of the mucous fluids in the eco- nomy are not doubtful. The most essential, is to protect the mucous membranes from the im- pression of bodies with which they are in con- tact, every one of which, as we have seen, are foreign to that of the animal. These fluids form over the respective surfaces a layer, compen- sating, in some degree, for the excessive tenu- ity, nay, even for the deficiency of their epi- dermis. Thus, wherever this membrane is very apparent, as over the lips, on the glands, in the nostrils, and in general wherever the mucous membranes originate, these fluids are not over- abundant. The skin is moistened merely with an oily fluid much inferior to the mucus wTe are now considering, because it has a strong epi- dermis. This use of the mucous fluids, explains why they are more abundant where the excretions stagnate for some time, as in the bladder, in the extremity of the rectum, &c. than in the ureters, and in general in all the excretory ducts.622 MUCOUS SYSTEM. i It also explains why, whenever these substances might prove injurious, these fluids shower in a greater profusion over their surfaces. The con- tinuance of the bougie in the urethra, of an in- strument in the vagina to compress a polypus, or in the fossse nasales for the same purpose ; the tube fixed in the lachrymal sac, and that adapted to the oesophagus as a substitute for deglutition, ne- cessarily produce in the mucous surfaces corre- sponding to these instruments a more abundant secretion of the fluids with which they are habi- tually full; in short, a real catarrh. This is one of the essential reasons that prevents an elastic bougie from remaining stationary in the trachea. The superabundant mucus then separated by ob- structing the apertures of the instrument, require it to be repeatedly cleaned, and may even threaten the patient with suffocation, as Desault himself has observed ; although he has, as I have stated in my book on Chirurgical Operations, reaped great advantage from their use. I must even add, that since my publication on the membranes, I have attempted to fix a tube in the trachea of a dog, and that the animal soon died after it, his bronchia being filled with a frothy fluid, which had evidently caused suffocation. It appears then, that every excitement of the mucous surfaces, if rather quick, causes in the cor- responding glands a remarkable increase of ac- tion. But bow can this excitement, which does523 MUCOUS SYSTEM. not directly affect the gland, have such an amaz- ing influence upon it? For, as has already been stated, these glands are constantly subjacent to the membrane, and consequently separated by it from the irritating agent. This seems to form a general modification of the glandular sen- sibility, which admits of being forced into action, as will be proved when treating of the glandular system, by every thing that acts upon the extre- mities of the excretory tubes. To the readiness with which the mucous glands answer the irritation of the extremity of their tubes, must be referred the artificial catarrhs, Vauquelin has been affected with, by breathing emanations arising from oxygenated muriatic acid, the mucous discharge attendant upon a polypus, or any tumour in the vagina, a stone in the bladder, &c.; the repeated white discharge in females, from the too frequent indulgence of the sexual appetite, the more abundant flow of mucous from the nose in persons who take an immoderate quantity of snuff, &c.: in all such cases thereis evidently an excitement of the mucous tubes. To this excite- ment I also refer the mucous transudation pro- duced by exciting the nipple of the breast of a woman that does not suckle, the abundant secre- tions from the presence of any irritating substance in the intestines, secretions which especially fur- nish the matters of diarrhoea; which disorder the624 MUCOUS SYSTEM. stomach subsequent to an indigestion, that has suf- fered undigested and consequently irritating mat- ter to remain upon the mucous surface of the stomach: these are real catarrhs of the mem- brane of the stomach, catarrhs most generally unaccompanied with bilious turgescence. I might add a multiplicity of other instances of mucous secretions increased by an irritation directed upon the surface of the membranes in the extremity of the excretory ducts : these, however, will be sufficient to convey an idea of the others. All these excitements produce a kind of inflam- mation, which first contracts for some time the glandular tubes, and arrests the secretion it sub- sequently causes to flow abundantly. After the discharge has been increased for some time, it is gradually reduced, although the cause still exists. Thus the mucus of the urethra, after the bougie has uninterruptedly been used for a month, flows in a smaller proportion than on the first applica- tion ; but most generally as long as the cause sub- sists, it is more abundant than in the natural state. In the practice of medicine, according to some, blisters are frequently prescribed to divert the morbid matter; to supersede, according to the others, the natural excitement by an artificial one. Why, in a multiplicity of cases, should not also the mucous surfaces be irritated ? Why not act uponMUCOUS SYSTEM. 525 the pituitary membrane, upon the glans, the mem- brane of the urethra, upon the pharynx, &c. on the uvula in particular, which is so exquisitely sensi- ble ? Why, instead of applying blistering plaisters on the perineum, or the sacrum, is not a bougie introduced in the urethra for paralysis of the blad- der? In cases of hemiplegia, instead of acting upon the cutaneous organ, I have already twice used the following means :—I have introduced a bougie in the urethra, and one in each nostril, whilst the surgeon irritated, from time to time, the uvula ; the patients appeared much more excited, than by blistering. Strong purgative injections,and emetics, prove what advantages may be derived in such cases from exciting the mucous mem- branes. In ophthalmia, would it not often be pre- ferable to produce an artificial catarrh in the nostril adjacent to the diseased organ, than to apply a blister or a seton over the neck ? I attempted it once, but without success, for the disease was of long standing and inveterate. I intend frequently to renew these trials in the Hotel Dieu, on various subjects. In general, I believe, that in diseases excitement of the mucous membrane might often be substituted to that of the skin, with much more advantage, since, upon the mucous system, contact is sufficient, and to form a kind of ulcer, by destroying the epider- mis, is by no means requisite. ' The mucous membranes act by their uninter-626 MUCOUS SYSTEM. rupted secretions, an essential part in the animal economy. They should be considered as forming one of those grand emunctories through which the residue of the nutriment is incessantly expelled, and consequently as one of the principal agents of the habitual decomposition that rids living bodies of the particles which, after having con- curred for a limited time, to the composition of the solids, have subsequently become hete- rogeneous to them. Let us remark that all mucous fluids are not admitted into the circula- tion, but are expelled ; that of the bladder, of the ureters, and urethra, with the urine; that of the vesiculse seminales and vas deferens, with the semen ; that of the fossae nasales in the act of blowing the nose; that of the mouth, partly by evaporation, partly through the anus with the faeces ; that of the bronchia with the pulmonary exhalation—chiefly effected, as I shall state, by the solution of this mucous fluid in the air that is inspired ; in those of the oesophagus, stomach, in- testines, gall bladder, &c. with the excrements of which they frequently form, in the natural state, a part nearly as considerable as those of the re- sidue of the food, which excrements are even ex- clusively composed of these fluids; in certain bloody fluxes ; in some fevers, wherein the quan- tity of matter expelled is evidently dispropor- tionate with that taken in, &c. In this respect we may observe that there is always some defect527 MUCOUS SYSTEM. in the analysis of the fluids in contact with the membranes we have just been mentioning, as in that of the urine, bile, gastric juices, &c. because it is very difficult, nay even impossible, to sepa- rate them from the mucous fluids. If we recollect what has previously been said respecting the extent of the two general mucous surfaces, equal, if not exceeding even that of the cutaneous organ, and then we represent to ourselves these two grand surfaces incessantly expelling the mucous fluids, it will be seen of what importance this evacuation must be in the economy, and what consequences may be attendant upon their injuries. To that law of nature commanding that every mucous fluid should be outwardly expelled, must partly be at- tributed the unctuous fluid which in the foetus fills the gall gladder, the meconium its intestines are gorged with, &c.: fluids apparently no- thing more than a collection of mucous juices, which stagnate until birth, without being absorbed from the respective organs where they have been secreted. Not only the mucous fluids are thus outwardly expelled, and in this manner serve as emunctories to the economy ; but moreover nearly all the fluids separated from the mass of the blood by se- cretion, are in the same case : this is evident in respect to the most considerable part of the bile ;MUCOUS SYSTEM. 628 most probably, the saliva, the pancreatic juice and the tears are also expelled w ith the faeces, which, on account of their hue, cannot, like the bile, be distinguished. I do not know, even, if on reflect- ing on a multiplicity of phenomena, we should not be inclined to lay down as a general princi- ple, that every fluid separated by secretion, never re-enters the circulation, that this phenomenon only belongs to fluids separated by exhalation, those of the serous cavities, of the articulations, of the cellular tissue, of the medullary organ, &c.; that all fluids are thus either excrementitial or re- crementitial, and that some of them are recrimen- titial excrements, according to the vulgar division. Bile in the gall bladder, urine in the bladder, se- men in its receptacles, are undoubtedly absorbed ; but the fluid itself is not returned into the circu- lation ; its finest parts only, a few of its princi- ples we are not well acquainted with, probably the serous and lymphatic part; this is nothing si- milar to the absorption from the pleura and other analogous membranes, where the fluid is returned to the blood, such as it was when emitted. A more positive fact, in respect to the outward excretion of the secreted fluids, is, that I never could succeed in having bile absorbed by the lymphatics ; by injecting it in the cellular tissue of an animal, it caused inflammation, and sub- sequently suppuration. It is well known thatMUCOUS SYSTEM. 529 infiltrated urine also is never absorbed, and causes the death of the parts it touches, whilst the infil- trations of lymph and blood are easily resolved. In respect to composition, there exists an essen- tial distinction between blood and the secreted fluids. In this respect, on the contrary, the ex- haled fluids, such as the serum, &c. approach it much more. Another very evident proof that all the mucous fluids are intended to be expelled, is, that as soon as they have stagnated for some time in a considerable quantity over their respec- tive surfaces, they cause a painful sensation, which nature relieves by various means. Thus coughing, the constant result of an accumulation of mucous fluids in the bronchia, expels them : thus vomiting fulfils the same office in disorders of the stomach, in respect to the fluids it had accumulated, causing, by their presence, a sen- sation of weight, and even of pain, although the membranes are not affected. We can cough at will, because that function is performed by the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles ; therefore medical practice has sought for no artificial means of producing it. But as vomiting is not effected in the same manner, and it often happens that the mucous juices, by considerably fatiguing the sto- mach, do not irritate it sufficiently to occasion contraction, art has resorted to various eme- tics. We are conscious of the painful sensation vol. ii. M MMUCOUS SYSTEM. 530 of weight caused by the stagnation of mucous accumulated in the frontal, maxillary sinuses, &c. when a part of the pituitary membrane is affected by a cold. The region of the bladder is for the same reason the focus of a disagreeable and even a painful sensation in the catarrhal affections of this organ. In general, the sensation arising from the ac- cumulations of mucous juices that have stagnated too long over their respective surfaces, vary, be- cause, as we shall see, each part of the mucous system has its peculiar mode of sensibility, so that pain is not the same for each, although produced by the same cause. This sensation does not re- semble that arising from the laceration, the quick irritation of our parts; it is weariness, an annoy- ing sensation difficult to be expressed. Every one is aware of the sensation caused by the accu- mulation of mucus in the fossae nasales, from not using the handkerchief, or that so very painful, arising from gastric affections, &c. Those who are afflicted with weakness in the lachrymal sac, wherein, by that reason tears have accumulated during night, experience, on their awaking in the morning, a sensation of heaviness, which they rid themselves of, by emptying that bag by compression, if the lachrymal punctae are left free, &c.MUCOUS ST S T KM. 531 Blood Vessels. The mucous membranes receive a considerable number of vessels. The remarkable redness by which they are distinguished would be sufficient to prove it, if injections did not: this colour is not every where the same. It is scarcely per- ceptible in the sinus of the face, in the internal ear, where the membranes are almost white, and \ are so very apparent, because their excessive te- nuity suffers the bone over wdiich they are ap- plied to be perfectly distinct. In the bladder, in large intestines, in the excretory ducts, &c. that colour though still very pale, is a little more strik- ing ; in the small intestines, stomach, vagina, in the pituitary membrane, and that of the palate, it is very deep. In the gall bladder it cannot possibly be distinguished, because its mucous sur- face in the corpse is constantly coloured by bile. This hue proceeds from a very intricate net- work of blood-vessels, whose branches, after hav- ing crossed the mucous corion, and being ramified in it, expand into numerous ramusculae over its surface, invest the papillae, and are covered with the epidermis only. It is this superficial situation of these vessels, consequently the deficiency of support in one of their surfaces, that so frequently exposes them to be ruptured by strong commotions, as is the case mm2MUCOUS SYSTEM. 532 with the surface of the bronchia in violent cough- ing ; with those of the ear and nose, from a vio- lent blow on the head : we are aware that he- morrhages of the mucous system near to the brain, are common accidents attending the wounds or blows of the head. This also explains why the smallest point of gravel frequently causes the ureters to bleed ; why the blood flowing with urine proclaims the presence of stone in the bladder ; why the catheter, ever so carefully in- troduced, is frequently withdrawn tinged with blood; why the slightest pressure of instruments introduced in the nostrils for a polypus, for a fis- tula lachrymalis causes hemorrhage. I have already observed, that these hemorrhages should be care- fully distinguished from those proceeding from the exhalants, which do not suppose any rupture of the blood vessels. This superficial position of the vessels of the muscous system, in many parts, as in the red ridge of the lips, the glands, &c. indicates the state of the circulation. Thus in the different kinds of asphyxia, in submersion, in stran- gulation, &c. these parts are remarkably livid, the effect of the veinous circulation which having undergone no change by the deficiency of respi- ration, has affected the most remote parts of the arterial system. By long exposure to atmospheric air, the mu- cous system is often deprived of the red colourMUCOUS SYSTEM. 533 msM by which it was characterized, and then ittn!§- sumes the appearance of the skin, as Sabatier has judiciously observed on treating of prolapsus of the womb and of the vagina, which from this cir- cumstance have deceived, and led us to believe the individual an hermaphrodite. The history of the vascular system of the mu- cous membranes, presents a very important question; namely, if according to different cir-v cumstances this system admits of more or less blood. As the organs which are internally lined with these kind of membranes, are nearly all lia- ble to contraction and distention, as is seen in the stomach, intestines, bladder, &c., it has been supposed, that on dilating, the vessels receive more blood, and that on contracting on the contrary, folded and collapsed as it were, they admit but of a small quantity of this fluid, which on such occasions is thrown upon the ad- joining organs. Chaussier has applied these prin- ciples to the stomach, the circulation of which he has considered, as being alternately reversed to that of the epiploon, which received during the vacuity of that viscus, the blood it rejected by being contracted. Since the time of Lieutand, a similar use has also been attributed to the spleen. What follows in this respect, is the result of my observations on animals opened during absti- nence, and at the different periods of digestion.MUCOUS SYSTEM. 634 ntlt. Whenever the stomach fills, the vessels' ramifying* over its external surface, are more ob- vious than when it is empty. The internal mu- cous surface is not redder, it has even sometimes appeared to me less so; *?,dly. The epiploon, less extended when the stomach is full, presents nearly the same number of apparent vessels, quite as long, but more tortuous than when it is in the contrary state. If then, they are less gorged with blood, the difference is of little importance. I have observed, that to distinguish this properly, particular care should be taken on opening the animal, that the blood does not fall upon the epiploon which first presents itself, and would thus prevent us from ascertaining the state it is in. This, besides, is an unavoidable consequence, resulting from the disposition of the vascular system of the stomach. In fact, the great coro- nary branch of the stomach being interposed transversely between this organ and the epiploon, and supplying them both with branches, it is evi- dent, that when the stomach, by separating the lamillae of the epiploon, forces itself between them and this, by investing that organ, becomes shorter; it is evident, I say, the branches it re- ceives from the coronary artery cannot also en- compass it: to admit of this, would require they should project from the one to the other without tlie interference of the trunk that divides them inMUCOUS SYSTEM. 535 a rectangular direction ; then on distending, the stomach would separate them as well as the epi- ploon, and force itself between them ; whereas it pushes them before it, together with the co- ronary, and obliges them to fold; 3dly. I can affirm there never exists such a very per- manent proportion between the spleen and the stomach, either in the state of plenitude or in that of vacuity, that these two circum- stances should, of necessity, coincide ; and that if the first organ, under various circumstances, is increased or reduced, it is not always precisely in a reverse sense to the stomach. To ascertain this, as Lieutand did, I tried experiments upon dogs: but the differences in size and age of those brought to me, made me rather apprehen- sive I had not been able to compare properly the spleen. I have repeated them on guinea-pigs of the same breed, of the same age, and compara- tively examined some whilst the stomach was empty, the others when it was full. In almost every instance I have found the volume of the spleen nearly the same, or at least the distinc- tion very immaterial. In other experiments, however, I have observed, that under various circumstances the spleen varies in bulk, and especially in weight; but this was indistinct both during and after digestion. From all this it appears, that if, during the va- cuity of the stomach, there is such a thing as a536 MUCOUS SYSTEM. reflux of blood towards the epiploon and spleen, it is much less considerable than has generally been thought. Besides the numerous folds of the mucous membrane of this viscus leaving in this state of vacuity, as has already been observed, nearly the same surface, and consequeutly the same number of vessels as during its plenitude, the blood must circulate in it with nearly the same freedom. There is then no real obstacle existing, except in the tortuous course, and by no means in the shrinking contraction and stran- gulation of these vessels produced by the con- traction of the stomach. Now this obstacle is easily removed, or rather it is no obstacle at all, as T have proved it by my researches upon death. In what regards the other hollow or- gans, it is very difficult to study the circulation in the surrounding parts, during their state of plenitude and of vacuity, because the vessels of the latter are not superficial as in the epiploon, \ or that these organs are not insulated like the spleen. To resolve the question then, the inter- nal membrane of the mucous surface only can be examined : but this surface has undeviatingly appeared to me as red during contraction as in the opposite state. Besides, I only bring this forward as a mere fact, without intending to deduce from it the least consequence reverse to the common opinion. It is possible in fact, that although the quantity537 MUCOUS SYSTEM. kV of blood is nearly always the same, the rapidity of circulation might be increased, and consequently, that in a limited time more of this fluid may be con- veyed during the plenitude, which seems requisite for the more abundant secretion of the mucous fluids then performed; a secretion, which is pro- duced by the presence of substances in contact with the membrane from which they originate : for in- stance, it cannot be called in question, but that three or four times the quantity of mucous is separated in the urethra when filled with the bougie, than when this canal is free, and, of course, the blood must be in proportion. The remarkable redness of the mticous system, the analogy of respiration where the blood flows through the mucous surface of the bronchia, the well-known experiment of a bladder filled with blood, and placed in oxygen gas, when this fluid is also dyed of a red colour, have induced us to be- lieve that the blood, in certain mucous surfaces, be- ing separated from atmospheric air, by a slight pel- licle only, as in the pituitary membrane,the palate, I the glands, &c. assumed also in these parts a deeper red, either by clearing itself of a portion of car- bonic acid gas, or by combining with the oxygen of the air, and that these membranes thus ful- filled functions attributed to the lungs. The ex- periments of Jurine on the cutaneous organs, ex- periments adopted by several eminent physicians, seem also to enforce this opinion.MUCOUS SYSTEM. 538 The following is an experiment I have tried to ascertain this fact. I have drawn through a wound, intentionally made in the abdomen, a portion of intestine which I tied ; I then re- turned it, reduced the wound, and kept a por- tion of that organ outwardly, which was also opened for inflation by atmospheric air, with which the whole part anterior to the ligature was filled. I then tied the intestine under the liga- ture and the whole was reduced. After an hour had elapsed, the animal was opened; I compared the blood of the mesenteric veins which arose from the part of the inflated gut, with that of the other mesenteric veins arising from the remainder of this tube, and found no difference in the colour; the internal surface of the part of intestine distended was not of a brighter red. I thought I should obtain a better effect, by repeating this experi- ment with oxygen gas on another animal; but even then I could observe no change in the colour of the blood. On the mucous mem- branes which commonly are in contact with air, this fluid is incessantly renewed, and kept in con- stant motion, but in the preceding experiment it had remained stagnant. I have attempted to produce the same effect in the intestines. I have made two apertures in the abdomen, and drawn through each a portion of intestine. I have adapted to one of these parts the tube of a blad- der filled with oxygen, to the other that of an639 MUCOUS SYSTEM. empty bladder \ then I compressed the filled blad- der in order to convey the oxygen to the other, by crossing the part of intestine left in the abdomen, and thus to keep on circulation through heat; by this means the oxygen was repeatedly con- veyed from one bladder to the other, forming a current in the intestine, which, considering its contractility, is not so easily effected as might at first be thought. The abdomen having subse- quently been opened, I observed no difference between the blood proceeding from that part of the intestine, and that which flowed from the others. The superficial situation of the mesenteric veins covered merely by a thin and transparent lamillae of the peritoneum, their size, if a large animal has been selected, will considerably facili- tate these comparisons. I was fullv convinced, that from what takes •j place in the intestines, nothing can be inferred in respect to the pituitary membrane, the palate, &c. because, although similar, the organization may be different. Here, as in the intestines, the veinous blood returned from the parts cannot be examined. But, 1st. If it be considered that in animals which have breathed oxygen for some time, the pituitary membrane and palate are not found of a deeper red; 2dly. If we reflect, that the livid colour observed in various parts of this membrane in subjects suffocated by carbonic acid gas, does not deduce from the immediateMUCOUS SYSTEM. 540 contact of that gas upon the membrane, but from the intrusion of the veinous circulation into the ar- terial system, as has been demonstrated, I believe, by my experiments; Finally, if it be re- marked, that in these various circumstances, the livid appearance of the mucous membranes by the veinous circulation, is not altered after death, although the skin is then more easily permeated with any kind of aerial fluid ; we shall find we ought to suspend our judgment respecting the colouring of the blood through the mucous mem- branes, until the question be elucidated by further observations. What follows, is another experiment that may throw some light on this point. I have filled the peritoneal cavity of several guinea-pigs with car- bonic acid gas, with hydrogen, with oxygen and atmospheric air, to try if I could obtain, through a serous membrane, the result that had failed in a mucous membrane ; subsequent to these experi- ments, I found no difference in the colour of the blood of the abdominal system ; it was similar to that of the common guinea-pig I had killed for the sake of comparison. I have often remarked, either in frogs, or in animals possessed of red and warm blood, as cats and guinea-pigs, that the blood, after some time, acquires a brighter red from the cellular tissue being permeated with oxygen, than it is observed to possess in artificial emphysema, pro-541 MUCOUS SYSTEM. duced by carbonic acid gas, hydrogen and at- mospheric air, instances in which the redness of the blood does not differ much from its natural degree. But in other instances, oxygen has not the slightest influence upon the colour of the blood; so that, alhough a multiplicity of experi- ments have been repeated on this head, I can point out no general result. It seems the tonic powers of the cellular tissue, and of the vascular parieties ramifying in this tissue, receive a very variable influence from the contact of gases, and that according to the nature of this influence, the fibres shrinking and contracting more or less, render these parts more or less liable to be per- meated by aerial fluids, that tend to escape from the blood to unite with those producing the em- physema, or by this last fluid, if it tend to com- bine with the blood, which undoubtedly caused the varieties I have observed. The red hue of the mucous system is analogous to that of the muscular system. It does not es- sentially proceed from the blood circulating in the minute arteries of this system: it proceeds from the colouring part of the blood being com- bined with the mucous tissue, particularly in the depth of the organs; for at the origin of the mu- cous surfaces, the principal cause of this colour will appear to arise from the circulation of the blood : in fact, the deep seated mucous surfaces are not made as livid by asphyxia as those super-MUCOUS SYSTEM. $42 ficial and communicating with the skin. The dark blood instantly reaches these through the last ar- teries, and thus they are coloured as we find them. In syncopy, when the heart is affected, it no longer conveys blood to the arteries, the colour in this part of the mucous system, as is well known, instantly fading. Besides, the deepest parts, as well as those of the muscles, must be deprived of their red hue by repeated washing and frequently changing the water ; but the fluid used for these lotions is not so red as that of the muscles. The moment a mu- cous surface is immersed in boiling water, let it be ever so red, like that of the intestines and the stomach, it instantly becomes white; a similar effect is also produced by the action of the nitric, sulphuric, and muriatic acids. In inflammation, this hue of the mucous sur- faces becomes remarkably vivid, a circumstance that arises from the quantity of blood accumu- lated in the capillary system. In bloody fluxes, the internal surface of the intestines presents this phenomenon in a conspicuous manner. I must observe, however, to those attending dissections, that the primitive aspect of that part of the mucous system they examine should never be lost sight of, since each division of that system presents very remarkable distinctions in its shades. If the membrane of the bladder, of the rectum, &c. be as red as that of the stomach in its natural state,MUCOUS SYSTEM. 543 we may be sure that they have been inflamed. There is, as I have said, a proportionate scale of colour for the mucous system. It is of conse- quence then, in dissection,to have a correct know- ledge of this scale, by which the degrees of inflam- mation may be determined. Exhcilants. Is there any exhalation at all in the mucous surfaces? The analogy with the skin seems to admit of it; for it is well proved that perspira- tion is not a transudation through the inorganic pores of the cutaneous surface, but is really emit- ted by vessels of a peculiar nature, and continued with the arterial system. It appears, at first, that the pulmonary perspi- ration, from the mucous surface of the bronchia, so very much connected with that of the skin, which lessens or increases accordingly as this in- creases or lessens, the matter of which in all pro- bability is of the same nature ; it appears, I say, that the pulmonary perspiration is in great part at least, effected through the agency of the ex- halant system, and that if the combination of the oxygen of the air with the hydrogen of the blood contributes to produce it during the act of respi- ration, it is in a small quantity only, and merely the watery part. Besides this last hypothesis of the modern chemists, contradictory to the pro-MUCOUS SYSTEM. 544 duction of all other humours expelled by the mucous surfaces, does not appear to me calculated to account for the formation of this. Whenever the phenomenon takes place in several parts, and the explanation given is applicable to one only, we should guard against such explanation. It ought to be remarked besides, that in re- spect to pulmonary perspiration, the solution of the mucous fluid by which the bronchia are lubri- cated, in air incessantly inspired and respired, composes a considerable part of that vapour which, imperceptible in the summer, is very re- markable in winter, on account of the condensa- tion of the atmosphere. The mucous juices dissolve the same as all other fluids; for wherever atmos- pheric air is united with heat and moisture, evaporation exists. This evaporation is even a medium nature has selected to rid herself, as I have said, of the mucous juices. If they hap- pen to be superabundant, as in catarrhs, then the quantity of air that acts as their vehicle, not be- ing proportionally increased, other means are re- quired to evacuate them ; expectoration is sub- stituted for the part air cannot remove by dis- solving it. The intestinal juice, especially considered by Haller, but which appears to be much less consi- derable than he first supposed, the oesophagean, and the gastric juices, particularly the latter, which is considered distinct from the mucous545 MUCOUS SYSTEM. juices are probably exhaled from their respective mucous surfaces. But in general it is very diffi- cult to ascertain correctly in these organs what belongs to the exhalant system and what is fur- nished by that of the mucous glands, which, as we have seen, are everywhere subjacent to them. Thus are the mucous humours of the oesophagus, stomach, and intestines, constantly found mixed with the fluids of these organs. As on the one part the blood vessels twine almost bare over the mucous surfaces, and that on the other the exhaling organs constantly originate from these vessels, it is evident that these have but a short distance to over-run to reach their surfaces ; they are pores rather than distinct ves- sels. This undoubtedly explains why the blood has such a tendency to flow through the exhalants, consequently why hemorrhage, unattended with laceration, is [so frequently seen flowing from the mucous system; why that affection even may be included in the catalogue of the diseases proper to this system, &c. In no other system have the exhalants, by the manner in which the arteries are disposed, so short a space to over-run between their origin and their .termination; frequently even, as I have said, the blood of these vessels may, by pressure in the corpse, be forced through 1 their exhalants.546 MUCOUS SYSTEM. Absorbents. The absorption of the mucous membrane is evidently proved ; 1st. By those of the chyle and beverages on the surface of the intestines, of the venereal matter on the glans and tube of the urethra, of the matter of the small-pox when the gums are rubbed with it, of the serous part of the bile, of urine, and of the semen, during their abode in their respective recipients ; 2dly. When from paralysis of the fleshy fibres that terminate the rectum, the faeces are accumulated in the extre- mity of that organ, they often acquire a degree of hardness, probably the effect of an absorption of the humours that are there obstructed; 3dly. There are several instances of urine being nearly totally absorbed by the mucous surface of the blad- der in irremoveable obstructions of the urethra; 4thly. If the air of a large jug, loaded with exhalations of turpentine, be inspired through a tube, so that these vapours should act only over the mucous surface of the bronchia, urine acquires that peculiar smell constantly produced by using that substance, the emanations of which have been conveyed to the blood by absorption, &c. In whatever manner this absorption may take place, it does not appear to be constantly nor un- interruptedly carried on, like those of the serous547 MUCOUS SYSTEM. membranes, wherein the exhalant and absorbant systems are alternately in regular and continual ac- tion. There are scarcely any other absorptions ex- cept those of chyle, of beverages, and of the watery parts of secreted fluids, stagnating in their reser- voirs on issuing from their respective glands, that are uninterruptedly continued ? Nothing is more variable than all the other absorptions. Under the very same influence, the glands will absorb or re- ject the venereal matter ; the internal surface of the bronchia sometimes receive, at other times reject morbid emanations. There are more in- stances of retention of urine in which this fluid is not wholly absorbed than cases wherein such absorption takes place, &c. &c. The innumer- able varieties in the vital powers of the mucous membranes—varieties produced by the difference of the exciting causes with which they come in \ contact—explain these phenomena. If these pow- ers are ever so little exalted or reduced, the ab- sorption is altered; even that which is natural, as the absorption of chyle. A purgative will con- tract and obliterate even the absorbing orifices of the intestinal tube ; as long as the irritation is continued, all fluids are expelled through the anus: after four or five hours have elapsed, the absorbents gradually re-assume their natural type, and absorption begins anew. These medicaments only expel at first the faecal matter, the subse- quent stools are nothing more than the copious N N 2MUCOUS SYSTEM. 548 beverage which has been taken. There are nu- merous cases in which, too much exalted, the sensibility of the lacteals, being no longer con- nected with the food, will hardly take the residue of it, &c. The same phenomenon may be pro- duced by a deficiency of action. In absorption, in fact, there is a medium degree of sensibility in the organ that performs it, above or below which degree this function cannot be affected. All mucous absorbents appear to resort to the thoracic duct. Nerves. 1 i I have remarked, that in every origin of the mucous system in which animal sensibility pre- dominates, and by which we become connected with exterior bodies, cerebral nerves are distri- buted. The pituitary membrane, the tunica con- junctiva, the membrane of the palate, the mucous surface of the rectum, of the glans, of the pre- puce, &c. evidently prove this assertion ; a ner- vous filament proceeding from the ganglia is rarely met with in these parts. These nerves, on the contrary, predominate in the intestines, in every excretory organ, in the reservoirs of the secreted fluids, &c., parts in which organic sensibility is the most striking.MUCOUS SYSTEM. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Mucous Systems., sectton r. Properties of the Tissue. Extensibility and contractility are more ob- scure in this system than they -would at first appear, on account of the numerous folds ob- served in the hollow organs during their con- traction, folds whicli merely open, as we have seen, during extension. In certain cases, how- ever, these two properties become very obvious. The excretory ducts admit of being much extended beyond their natural dimension. This phenome- non is particularly observed in the urinary duct which is sometimes seen as wide as an intestine. The ductus choledocus and the pancreatic duct present frequent instances of such dilatations. The urethra and salivary ducts seem less extensi- ble than the others : at the slightest obstacles from strictures, &c. they will sooner be lacerated than distended : hence the different fistuloe connected with these passages. There are then several va- rieties in the degrees of sensibility of the mucous system. These two properties, besides, are sus- ceptible of being rapidly brought into action. It550 I MUCOUS SYSTEM. is well known that the stomach, the intestines, the bladder, &c. pass in a moment from excessive distention to considerable contraction. Their functions even command that promptitude of motion, without which they could not be per- formed. The membrane which lines the cheeks whenever the mouth is filled with air, with food, which are subsequently expelled, presents the same phenomenon. Whenever the mucous tubes cease to be supplied with their habitual fluids, they remain in a state of permanent contraction. In cases of artificial anus, I have seen the coecum and rectum reduced to the size of a very large quill. The obliteration of the parietes, however, is always prevented by the presence of the mucous fluid, a small portion of which is always emitted by the patient. The urethra, after the operation of the stone, when the urine requires a considerable time to cross the wound, and in the great fistulas of the peri- neum, or above the pubis; the salivary ducts, when wounded so as to give exit to the whole of the saliva; the nasal duct in fistula laerymalis will contract more or less, but never become obliterated. We know that the vas deferens often remains a considerable time without being crossed by the semen, and yet it remains open. This phenomenon distinguishes the mucous from the arterial tubes, which, as soon as the course of the blood has been interrupted, are convertedMUCOUS SYSTEM. 551 into a kind of solid ligaments. This phenomenon, common to every mucous tube, should not be overlooked; it invalidates the practice of those who, thinking it impossible after some time for the natural passages to open again, deemed it necessary in fistulae to form artificial issues. Not only the mucous tubes never close when they are empty, but even when inflamed their parietes never contract any adherences, so fre- quently ascertained in the serous cavities, in the cellular tissue, &c. We may remark how pro- perly this fact is accommodated to the important functions of life. What would have become of these functions, if in the catarrhs of the intestines, bladder, stomach, oesophagus, excretory ducts, &c. these adhesions were as frequently met with as in the pleura, the peritoneum, the pericardium, &c ? SECTION ir. Vital Properties. There are few systems in which the vital pro- perties are more active or conspicuous than in this. Properties of Animal Life. Similar to the integuments, incessantly connected with exterior forms, the mucous surfaces require i « a degree of sensibility that could enable us toMUCOUS SYSTEM. 552 • 1 perceive the contact of foreign bodies, especially at the origin of these surfaces. Her\ce animal sensibility is remarkably developed in this system. In several parts even, it exceeds that of the cu- taneous organ, wherein no sensation is so lively as those originating in the pituitary membrane from scents, in the palate from flavours, in the surfaces of the vagina, the urethra, and the glans, from coition, &c. But without speaking of these violent sensations, if I may be allowed the ex- pression, all the natural phenomena of the mu- cous surfaces display this property conspicu- ously ; it would be superfluous to dwell upon them any longer. I have remarked, that this sensibility, as well as that of the cutaneous organ, are essentially sub- mitted to the immense influence of habit, which incessantly tending to blunt the exquisite sense of feeling of these membranes, they imperceptibly acquire that state when they afford both less plea- sure and pain ; a state that forms the intermedi- ate link of these two reverse sensations; 1st. I have said, that sensations of pain originating in the mucous membranes are by habit converted into a state of indifference. The introduction of a bougie in the urethra is acutely painful the first day, less on the second, annoying the third, insensible the fourth. The pessaries introduced into the vagina, the plugs placed in the rectum, the tents fixed in the nostrils, the tube secured inMUCOUS SYSTEM. 563 the nasal duct, present, though in different de- grees, the same phenomenon. Upon this remark is grounded the possibility of introducing a tube in the trachea to assist respiration, and in the oesophagus to produce artificial deglutition. This law of habit may even be carried so far as to convert into pleasure a sensation which was ori- ginally painful. The use of snuff for the pituitary membrane, that of various kinds of food for the palate, are striking instances ; 2dly. I have said that the sensations of pain ^originating in the mucous membranes are by habit converted into a state of indifference : the perfumer, surrounded with an embalmed atmosphere, the cook, whose palate is incessantly affected with delicious fla- vours, do not, in their respective professions, par- take of the enjoyments they prepare for others. By habit, sensations, at first agreeable, may even become painful. I have observed that this remarkable influence of habit relates only to the sensations produced by contact, and not to those produced by actual injury, such as laceration, over-distention, divi- ✓ sion, or pinching of any part of the mucous sys- tem : thus it will never alleviate the pains caused in the bladder, by the pressure, or even by the laceration from the stone, those in the surface of the womb, of the fossae nasales, &c. from a polypus* those of the tesophagus, or of the trachea, from a554 MUCOUS SYSTEM. rough and uneven body lodged there accidentally, &c. &c. To this power of habit over sensibility of the mucous system must partly be referred the gra- dual decay attendant upon age. Every thing is exciting for the infant, every thing has lost its power with the aged subject. In the one, the remarkable activity of the alimentary, biliary, urinary, salivary surfaces, <fcc. especially contri- bute in producing that rapidity with which the phenomena of digestion and secretion succeed each other; in the latter, this sensibility, blunted by the habit of contact, assumes but slow pro- gress in connecting these phenomena together. Is it not from this very same cause that the re- markable modification in the sensibility of this system proceeds; namely, that in its origins, as in the pituitary membrane, the palate, the oeso- phagus, the glans, the orifice of the rectum, &c. it conveys the sensation of the bodies it is in con- tact with, whilst this sensation is not felt in the organs lined with it, that are very deeply situate, as in the intestines, the excretory ducts, the gall- bladder, &c. ? In the depth of organs this con- tact is uninterruptedly uniform. The bladder is only sensible to the contact of urine ; the gall- bladder to that of bile ; the stomach singly ad- mits of that of nutritive matters, masticated and reduced, however varied they may be, into an655 MUCOUS SYSTEM. uniform pulp. This uniformity in sensation na- turally commands nullity in perception, because to perceive, comparison is required, and here two terms of comparison are wanting. Thus the foetus is insensible to the liquor amnii: thus air, at first very irritating to the new-born child, ends by not being perceived. Excitants, on the con- trary, vary continually at the origins of the mu- cous membranes. We can perceive their presence, because we are enabled to compare their various modes of action. What I say is so perfectly true, that if in the depth of organs the mucous membranes come in contact with any substance they are accustomed to, it is instantly perceived. The sound in the bladder, the tubes introduced in the stomach, &c. are instances; the fresh air which through a very hot atmosphere instantly reaches the trachea, spreads over the whole surface of the bronchia a soothing and pleasing sensation ; but habit soon makes us insensible of the benefit, and its perception is soon lost. It should be ob- served, however, that whenever, in cases of the^ artificial anus, the intestines are forced outwardly, the sensibility of these organs is never so exquisite as that proper to the palate, the pituitary mem- brane, &c.: the deficiency of cerebral nerves un- doubtedly influences this phenomenon. In inflammations, the sensibility of the mucous system is considerably exalted ; how very painful acute catarrhs are, is sufficiently known. Contact556 M CJCOUS SYSTEM* in such cases is not only felt, but even very pain- ful, I have observed, however, that in this case sensibility is never so much increased as in the cellular, serous, fibrous systems, &c. undergoing inflammation: a phlegmon, pleuritis, &c. compared with a catarrh, will convince us of this. One would be induced to think that the organs feeling the least in their natural state, have the most powerful sensations in a morbid one. Animal contractility is wanting in the mucous system." Properties of Organic Life.'* In this system organic sensibility, and insensi- ble contractility or tone, are excessively deve- loped : they are incessantly brought into play by four distinct causes; 1st. By the nutrition of this system ; 2dly. By its absorption, either natu- rally or accidentally produced ; 3dly. By the ex- halation, of which it is the seat; 4thly. By the con- tinual secretion from its glands. These two pro- perties are the primitive causes of all these func- tions, the increase or reduction of which actually indicate the state they are in. As a multiplicity of causes are incessantly acting upon the mucous surfaces, as a great variety of exciting agents stimulate them uninterruptedly, at their origin particularly, this state, as well as the functions, must incessantly vary. The mucous system then varies from the557 raUCOUS SYSTEM. ■greater part of others; 1st. Inasmuch as the or- ganic sensibility and insensible contractility are habitually increased, in consequence of the nu- merous functions over which they preside; 2dly. inasmuch as they incessantly vary, on account of the variety of exciting causes. In fact, let it be remarked, that in the systems of bones, fibres, cartilages, muscles, nerves, &c. on the one hand these properties are only brought into action by nutrition, and on the other hand, no exciting agent being in contact with these systems, they always continue the same. Hence it is not astonishing, if diseases in which organic sensibility and insensible contractility are concerned, so frequently affect the mucous organs. Every catarrhal affection, either acute or chronic, all kinds of hemorrhages, the number and di- vers tumours, polypi, funguses, &c. all kinds of excoriations, ulcers, &c. of which they are the seat, proceed from the .various alterations of their organic properties. To these alterations also, a remarkable pheno- menon must be referred, namely, the innumerable varieties displayed by the mucous fluids, in disease. Let only those rejected by the internal surface of the bronchia be selected for an example, fluids that are expelled by expectoration, and which are more easily investigated, as they are not mixed with any foreign substance ; let us only consider how much in the different affections ofMUCOUS SYSTEM. 558 1 \ the chest they differ from each other; sometimes presenting a yellowish hue, bilious as it were ; at other times leaving nothing but froth ; some- times remarkably viscid, or flowing readily from the vessel that contains them, fetid or inof- fensive in their smell. In the morning frequently grayish, whitish, greenish, or of a blackish ap- pearance, they display a variety of aspects, evi- dently denoting differences in their composition, differences which chemistry has not yet accounted for. I do not speak of those cases in which, as in phthisis, hemophysis, &c. foreign substances are mixed with these mucous juices. Now it is evident, that all these varieties depend solely upon varieties in the organic sensibility of the bronchial glands, or of the membrane over which these organs shed their fluids. Accordingly as this property is altered in the mucous system, this becomes connected with such and such sub- stances, selecting some, and rejecting others. The very same organ then, the very same vessel, may, according to the state of their vital powers, se- parate from the mass of blood a variety of sub- stances, reject some of them at one time, or se- lect them at another, &c. If further proofs of the changes which the various modifications ot the organic sensibility of the mucous membrane produce in their functions are required, let us re- gard the urethra ; in its ordinary state it opens a free passage to urine; when its powers are ex-MUCOUS S VST KM. 559 cited at the time of erection, its sensibility rejects this fluid and admits of the semen only. Who is not aware, that in one kind of epiphora, the mu- cous issues for the tears are free, and that this fluid is merely prevented from flowing from the reduction of their vital powers ? The sensibility of the mucous surfaces is frequently so changed, that their glands will admit of no kind of fluid whatever. This is what happens in certain cases of peripneumony, wherein the expectoration is wholly suppressed, a fatal symptom, and even generally terminating in death if no change oc- * curs in the state of the sensibility, if an effort, as it is commonly termed, does not take place. Generally speaking, there are, I believe, few systems more deserving of consideration than this, on account of the innumerable alterations to which it is liable, alterations supposing almost constantly those of the vital properties predomi- nating in this system, as the alterations in the muscular nervous systems, &c. most generally bring into play the properties more particularly belonging to them, namely, animal contractility for the one, animal sensibility for the other. Sensible organic contractility does not seem to be one of the properties of the mucous system; but it occasionally displays something more than the insensible oscillations which constitute the other species of organic contractility : in the emis-MUCOUS SYSTEM. 5G0 sion of the semen for instance, for which the ex- tremity of the urethra is unprovided with an im- pulsive agent, as for the evacuation of urine, it is highly probable that this spasmodically contracts to produce the emission, which is sometimes rather forcible. What follows is a phenomenon I have observed upon myself, and which appears to me to proceed from the very same cause. On gaping, a small quantity of fluid is sometimes squirted from the mouth then wide open, which, proceeding from the lateral parts of that cavity it crosses, is projected to some distance. But as this duct is almost completely mucous, and its posterior part is unprovided with a mus- cular impulsive agent, it is probable that the ex- cretory ducts which emit their fluids within the organs, have a similar action. It is well known, that milk is also squirted out whenever it is over abundant, which supposes a quick contraction of the lacteal tubes. In general, these different mo- tions, similar to that of the dartcs, of the cellular tissue, &c., seem to form the intermediate link, between those of force, and those of irritability. J Sympathies. Few systems sympathise with others more frequently than this ; but sometimes is influenced, at other times they are uninfluenced. Tissot has denominated the first mode of sympathy, active,561 MUCOUS SYSTEM. and the second, passive. In the present instance let us adopt this classification. Active Sympathies„ If any part of the mucous system be irritated, inflamed, or excited, every vital power may be brought separately into action in the other systems. 7 Sometimes the animal contractility is sympa- thetically called into action ; thus will the dia- phragm, the intercostal and abdominal muscles, contract and produce either sneezing, by irritating the pituitary membrane, or coughing, by irri- tating the membrane of the bronchia, or even the surface of the stomach, which, as is well known, has no connexion whatever with the chest. The general spasm that seizes every muscle the moment a foreign body forces its way between the mucous ridges of the epiglottis has been re- peatedly ascertained. A stone in the bladder, or in the ureter, by causing a sympathetic contrac- tion of the cremaster muscle, produce a retraction of the testis. Physicians, in my opinion, might derive great advantage from a knowledge of these sympathies. In apoplexy, wherein the bronchia is sometimes filled with mucous fluids, the pa- tient is unable to expectorate : the action of am- monia on the pituitary membrane will produce the two-fold effect; First, of stimulating the brain as VOL. II. a o562 MUCOUS SYSTEM. effectually as blisters ; Secondly, of relieving, by the cough it produces, the surface of the bronchia, which, if too much obstructed, might prove an obstacle to the admission of air, &c. Sometimes it is the animal sensibility that iscalled into play by an affection of the mucous surfaces. The stone, which excites that of the bladder, causes itching at the end of the glands; irrita- tion from worms in the intestines causes a trouble- some itching at the end of the nose; Whytt has shown that the whole of one side of the head had been painfully affected by a foreign body having found its way into the corresponding ear; that an ulcer in the bladder, whenever the patient voided the urine, occasioned a pain in the upper part of the thigh, &c. &c. Sensible organic contractility is sympathetically excited by the affections of the mucous system. I might first mention in this respect, what I have observed relative to the organic muscles, which nearly all move in consequence of the excite- ment received by an adjacent mucous surface; but this is a natural phenomenon ; there are many more accidental ones. A stone that irritates the internal surface of the pelvis of the kidney, causes vomitings, which are constantly, as is well known, produced at will by irritating the velum palati. The moment the semen crosses the urethra in the act of coition, the action of the heart is generally accelerated. Tissot states that a stone which had563 MUCOUS SYSTEM. forced its way in the Warthon’s duct produced sympathetic diarrhoea. At the Hotel Dieu, I at- tend two females, who, during the catamenia, (consequent whenever the mucous surface of the womb is very active,) cannot for any length of time retain the urine in the bladder, which without the interference of the will contracts to expel the fluid the moment it is received into this organ: at other times nothing particular is ob- served in the evacuation of the urine. In respect to the sympathies of insensible con- tractility, they are produced whenever a mucous surface being irritated towards the orifice of an excretory duct, the gland of that duct comes into play; when, for instance, the saliva is caused to flow more abundantly over the extre- mity of Stenon’s duct, whenever the stomach is disordered; consequently whenever the mucous surface of the stomach is diseased, the surface of the tongue is sympathetically affected ; hence those whitish and mucous spots, constituting what is generally called a furred tongue, displaying ac- tually a sympathetic catarrh, but which, however, may exist idiopathically. To the same cause may also be referred the remarkable influence of the mucous system upon the skin : thus, during diges- tion, when the mucous fluids shower abundantly from every quarter into the stomach and intes- tines, when the gastric viscera consequently are very active, the insensible perspiration of Sano- o o 2MUCOUS SI STEM. 564 torious is considerably diminished; three hours after the meal it is reduced to a very minute quan- tity indeed; so that the action of the c.utaneous organ is evidently less energetic. Thus, during sleep, when all the internal functions become more characterized ; when consequently the sensibility of the raucous membranes is much increased, the skin seems to be struck with a kind of atomy; it is much sooner cooled, less fluid isexhaled from it, &c. To these sympathies the phenomena of hemorrhages must also be referred. There are numerous in- stances of the facility with which the mucous sur- face ceasing, by an accidental cause, to pour out blood, as is frequently the case with the uterus, another surface is instantly affected, and emits the fluid: hence proceed the hemorrhages of the nose, stomach and chest, &c. after suppression of the lochia. Passive Sympathies. In many cases, from irritation of the other sys- tems, the animal sensibility of this is excited. Amongst various instances of this fact, the follow- ing is a very remarkable one :—In the numerous diseases of organs foreign to the mucous system, a sensation of burning heat is felt in the mouth, stomach, and intestines, Ac.; and yet the mu- cous surface, the seat of this sensation, separates no more caloric than usual; as we may be con-565 MUCOUS S VST KM. vinced by placing the fingers in the mouth. This sensation is of the very same nature as that re- ferred to the glands whenever there is stone in the bladder ; as that felt at the end of the nose from worms in the intestines, &c. There is no material cause for pain, and yet pain is felt. Thus, in in- termittent fevers a subcutaneous shivering is expe- rienced, although the skin is possessed of its natu- ral degree of heat. In this respect, I have ob- served that the mucous membranes are hardly ever the seat of a similar sensation of sympathetic cold, but that most generally the aberrations of the vital powers are produced by a sensation of heat. Whence does this difference between them and the cutaneous organ proceed? I cannot tell. To the sympathies of animal sensibility I also attri- bute that excessive thirst, proceeding from a seri- ous injury in any part of the body. In every considerable wound subsequent to an important operation, in experiments on living animals, &c.} this thirst, depending upon a sympathetic affec- tion of the whole raucous surface, extending to the mouth, stomach and oesophagus, is; observed. Animal contractility cannot possibly be brought to act sympathetically in the mucous system, since it does not exist in the organs of which it is composed. Sensible organic contractility, the kind of mo- tion we have pointed to, and bordering upon this566 MUCOUS SYSTEM. property, may possibly be sometimes stimulated by sympathy, but I know of no instance of it. Insensible organic contractility in this system is very frequently actively and sympathetically affected. The skin, particularly in what relates to this property, bears the utmost influence over the mucous system. 1st. In hemorrhages of the mucous surface of the uretus, of the nostrils, &c. a cold body applied over the skin will contract this surface and stop the blood. 2dly. Who is not aware that the greatest number of catarrhs are frequently an immediate result of the effect of cold upon the cutaneous organ ? 3dly. In the different affections of the mucous membranes, beneficial effects are often derived from baths that relax and soften the skin. 4thly. Whenever the vitality of the skin is reduced by the temperature of the atmosphere, the mucous system acquires a remarkable degree of tone. This explains why in winter and in cold climates the functions of the skin being limited, all those of this system increase in a proportionate ratio ; hence an in- crease of pulmonary exhalation, and of the internal secretions, more active digestion, and the keen appetite in consequence. 5thly. When, on the contrary, the heat of climate and of season happens to relax and expand the skin, we might suppose that the mucous surface contracts in pro- portion. In hot countries, in summer, &c. the567 MUCOUS SYSTEM. secretions are reduced, particularly those of urine. The phenomena of digestion are slow in their progress, from a deficiency of action in the stomach, intestines, &c.; the appetite is produced * with difficulty, &c. In many general affections of the skin, certain parts of the mucous mem- branes are most generally affected. In scarlatina the throat, in almost every case, is sympathetically affected, and in small-pox this phenomenon is remarkably common. In the last periods of organic injuries of the viscera, as in phthisis, diseases of the heart, obstructions of the liver, cancers of the womb, &c. the mucous membranes, as well as the serous surfaces, are affected. The state of atomy, as it were, they are reduced to, causes in these tissues a more abundant afflux of mucous juices, which changing, then become more fluid, &c.; hence the diarrhoeas called col- liquative, which in such cases are to the mucous surfaces what dropsies are to the serous mem- branes. 8thly. To this state of atomy again must be referred the pectoral hemorrhages so very frequent in the latter periods of organic disease, especially in those of the heart. Within the short space of time I have attended at the Hotel T>leu, I have seen and opened more than twenty subjects that died of such affections, which before the time of Corvisart were almost entirely overlooked. Now I have only noticed four in-668 MUCOUS SYSTEM. stances in which the passive hemorrhages of the lungs were not an infallible prognostic of death* Character of the Vital Properties, From what has hitherto been stated, it is evident that the mucous system is one of those in the economy endowed with the most active degree of vitality. Incessantly in contact with substances it is excited and irritated by, this system may be compared to the skin in a state of permanent action. Its vitality, however, is not the same in every part, but it undergoes in each of them remarkable modifications, which undoubtedly depend upon those which have been pointed out in the organization of this system, in the nature of its corium, the distribution of its papillae, in that of its vessels and nerves, of its glands, &c. ; for we have found that none of these essential parts of the mucous system are disposed throughout in the same manner; there exists an organization general to the system, and one proper to each of its divisions. It is the same in respect to vitality; there is a life general to the system, and as many peculiar degrees of it as there are parts to which this system is extended. It is sufficiently known how much the animal sensibility of the pituitary mem-MUCOUS SYSTEM. 569 brane differs from that of the palate; how much the membrane of the glands and of the urethra is quickly stimulated by the emission of semen, which would make no impression on any other mucous surface. The same observation applies to the organic sensibility and contractility of the same description. Every mucous surface con- nected with its habitual fluid could hardly bear the approach of any other. Urine would be irri- tating to the stomach ; the gastric juices to the bladder; the bile stagnant in the gall bladder would produce a catarrh if applied to the mem- brane of the nostrils, in the seminal organs, &c. From such varieties in the vital powers of each division of the mucous system, should it then be matter of wonder if the diseases of this system are so very variable ? Each actually bears a general character, but this character is modified accord- ing to every mucous surface. There is an order of symptoms common to all catarrhs ; but every individual catarrh has its particular signs, each a different product. The humour expelled in a pulmonary catarrh in no respect resembles that of the nose ; the discharges proceeding from a catarrh in the uterus, in the bladder, &c. are quite distinct from those of intestinal catarrhs, &c. These fluids display in their morbid changes the very same differences we have pointed out in their natural composition, differences proceeding,670 MUCOUS SYSTEM. as these do, from the distinct vitality that each part of this system is endowed with. To these varieties of vitality, and of vital powers, must also be referred those of their sym- pathies. Each portion of this system has a sympathetic action over the other organs proper to itself: irritation of the pituitary membrane will produce sneezing; but however much the extremity of the glands, of the rectum, &c. be excited, we cannot produce any effect, as by irri- tating the uvula. It is now the time to make an important remark respecting the stomach. No organ, as is well known, takes such an important part in sympathies as this ; the slightest affection of this important viscus extends its painful influence throughout the animal economy; the injury affects all the other parts. I even do not be- lieve there exists a more disagreeable and general trouble than that which in particular cases is then felt. That general feebleness which follows al- most immediately upon hunger is sympathetic ; the change of nutrition has not had time to pro- duce it. To the same cause must be referred the sudden increase of strength resulting from the contact of food on the mucous surface of this viscus, an increase which cannot be referred to the admission of chyle into the blood, since suffi- cient time had not elapsed.MUCOUS SYSTEM. 571 I believe the important part which the stomach acts in sympathies, is especially owing to its mucous surface. In fact, first, its serous surface does not interfere with it, since it is of the very same nature as the whole remainder of the peri- toneum, and besides, in what is called enteritis, in which this serous membrane is especially affected, such frequent and varied sympathetic affections are not observed. 2dly. The fleshy tunic appears to be the same as that of the whole intestinal tube: why then should it be different in its affection ? 3dly. In what relates to the blood vessels and the nerves of the ganglia, the organization of the stomach is nearly the same as that of the remainder of the alimentary tubes. dthly. It receives also the par-vagum; but does this nerve alone produce such a multiplicity of phenomena ? It may con- tribute to them, but most undoubtedly the modi- fications it experiences in the mucous surface, and the peculiar nature of this membrane, must also be included. No membrane in the economy is organized like that of the stomach. Although we do not immediately perceive its organic dis- tinctions, a slight reflection will be sufficient to prove it, for none of the membranes separate such a considerable quantity of fluid, none sepa- rate fluids analogous to the gastric juices.572 MUCOUS SYSTEM. ARTICLE IV. Development of the Mucous System. SECTION i. State of the Mucous System in the early Stage of Life. The developement of the mucous system fol- lows, in general, the laws of the organs to which it belongs. Early in the gastric organs, more retarded in the pulmonary, and in that of gene- ration, it seems in its growth rather to obey a received impulse than to impress one upon its surrounding parts ; a disposition common nearly to all systems that contribute to form particular parts. Let it be observed in fact, there constantly exists in growth certain parts to which all the others are referred : thus the size of the brain determines that of the bones of the skull, of the dura-mater, the pia-mater, the tunica arachnoides, and of their vessels. Thus it is that the better to contain the spinal marrow, the vertebral canal is formed at such an early period in the foetus: thus have all serous surfaces an increase proportionate to that of their respective organs, <fec. See. I have remarked, however, that the early growth in systems that merely follow that of the parts they are intended for, relates only to the longitudinal and transverse dimensions,MUCOUS SYSTEM. 573 that, in general, the thickness does not cor- respond to these dimensions. Thus the bones of the cranium, though proportionally much wider in the foetus than those of the pelvis, are not the thickest. The dura-mater is proportionally more extended than the tunica albuginea, which belongs to the same system, but its organization is not more complete. In the foetus, the mucous tissue is excessively thin : the papillae are almost imperceptible, but by passing the hand gently over a mucous surface, it has a remarkable soft velvety feel, such even as art cannot imitate. The red colour of this system is not so deep then, undoubtedly, because it is per- meated with less blood, as the various functions connected with it, digestion, excretion, respira- tion, &c. are not very active, and are even com- pletely null. At this period the quantity of blood in the skin, and in these surfaces, appears to be quite in a reverse sense. The mucous surfaces, like the muscles, are of a very deep or even livid colour, on account of the nature of the blood circulated by the arteries. Then the adhesions of the mucous tissue with the subjacent cellular tissue are less firm, and particularly that of the latter, with the surrounding parts. Thus a part of the internal surface of the intestines of the foetus may be easily withdrawn from within 1 external coating, so as to form two cylindri- cal tubes, one of which is muscular and serous,574 MUCOUS SYSTEM. the other cellular and mucous. In this experi- ment all the valvulae conniventes are destroyed, and in the canal artificially drawn out, the small intestines are as smooth internally as the large. When this canal is boiled much more scum arises i from it than from that of the adult. This scum is whitish, but never green. The shrinking which takes place a short time previous to ebullition reduces proportionally much more the length of the canal, which appears very strong in conse- quence. At birth, respiration and digestion suddenly be- ginning, and the secretions increasing, the mucous system assumes a remarkable degree of activity. It is on a sudden powerfully excited by the mul- tiplicity of new substances with which it is in con- tact. It is owing to this system, and to the cutaneous, that forms foreign to our body spon- taneously stimulate it, and so much more effec- tually, as the excitement is quite new to the twofold surface by which it is received. Then the mucous system receives from the approach of the red blood additional degrees of energy and sensibility, which make it the fitter to receive impressions. Thus the mucous juices, so far stagnant over their respective surfaces without causing inconvenience, become irritating in con- sequence of the increase, and force the subjacent muscles to contract. The urine then becomes to the bladder a cause of contraction. Soon afterMUCOUS SYSTEM. 575 birth all the apertures of the mucous membranes open, and suffer the mecomium, urine, and all the mucous juices to escape. This internal and general commotion, which empties all the mucous cavities, prepares them for the important func- tions they are soon to perform. When once all the functions are in a state full of activity, the mucous surfaces no longer expe- rience abrupt changes, similar to that I have just been mentioning ; as the other viscera they increase in a slow and insensible manner: they retain for a long time their primitive softness, a softness very remarkable, particularly in the nose, stomach, <£c.; and which whilst the child suckles, were not adapted to come in contact with solid substances; indispensable food to the adult. Is this softness a cause of the mucous affections in general so very common at that stage of life ? We are aware that the mucous juices abound at that time ; the pituitary membrane is more moist; that the stomach and intestines are frequently af- fected by a kind of catarrh, causing those purgings which we have so frequently to counteract in infants. The membrane of the bronchia is also frequently diseased. The two extreme stages of life have much resemblance with each other, in the abundant quantity of mucous juices that are separated upon their respective surfaces. In youth, the action of the mucous system is very energetic. Active hemorrhages are re-MUCOUS SYSTEM. 676 markably common at that age : those of the nose, of the bronchia, even of the stomach, frequently take place : those of the parts of this system that are subjacent to the diaphragm are then much scarcer. In this respect it may be remarked that in man, the hemorrhages of the gastro-pulmonary surfaces are much more frequent than those of the genito-urinary surface, which, on the contrary, is much more extensive in the female, in whom a natural one exists in this part, namely, the men- strual discharge. At the time of puberty, the developement of the genital parts in both sexes gives a consi- derable degree of activity to a part of the genito- urinary surface: menstruation then begins in that of the uterus ; and its sensibility is raised to that pitch requisite to feel exquisitely the emission of semen. This increase of energy is not attended with a reduction of powers in other parts, as is the case in numerous instances : every system, every set of organs, on the contrary, seems to derive from that increase of powers ; in the genital parts an increase of action. SECTION II. State of the Mucous System in the subsequent Ages. In those years just following upon youth the mucous system continues to grow, to thicken, and become firmer. Its vital energy still seems to pre-MUCOUS SYSTEM. 577 dominate for some time in the superior surfaces, as in the pituitary membrane, that of the bronchia, &c.: thus are the affections of these parts more frequent until the age of thirty; but as we ad- vance in years, the abdominal mucous surfaces seem to predominate over the others, as in general does every organ of that region. Besides, a thousand causes, in the course of life, will produce varieties in the state of the mucous system. In two different subjects it never dis- plays the same shade, the same degree of density, the same exterior appearance; on taking any portion whatever from several subjects, that of the stomach for instance, these distinctions are ob- vious ; distinctions which are very striking even to those who are but little accustomed to dis- r section. Until the age of thirty, the mucous tissue is of a very bright red colour, afterwards it begins to fade. As we advance in years it gradually be- comes paler, a small quantity of blood only being conveyed to it; and it acquires additional degrees of consistence and density. By passing the fingers over it, that pleasing softness, once so very re- markable, is no longer felt. Its powers become languid, and this explains why the emission of fluids that cross the excretory ducts, to be ex- pelled outwardly, is attended with difficulty. The mucous glands, however, still separate a con- siderable quantity of fluids : frequently even these von. II. p p578 MUCOUS SYSTEM. fluids increase in proportion; which constitutes the catarrhal affections, so very common in old age. But these affections then assume the very same character as those of the whole system; se- cretion is slowly performed, the disease constantly assumes a chronic type, and most frequently ter- minates in death. Mucous absorption at that stage of life, is like every other, slow, and attended with difficulty : the different infections are not so readily taken, either by the surfaces of the organs for respira- tion, or by the contact of morbid emanations with the surfaces adjoining the skin. Chyle slowly absorbed, requires more time in the di- gestive periods.SEROUS SYSTEM, This system, whose name also, like that of the preceding, I borrow from the fluid with which its surfaces are habitually lubricated, is, like the former, disposed in a membranous form, never in fasciculi, like the muscular system ; or reduced to spherical bodies, like the glandular. It is formed by the peritoneum, the pleura, the tunica arach- noides, the tunica vaginalis, &c. The word mem- brane then, will be frequently used to designate it. No one, I believe, before my Treatise upon Membranes had appeared, viewed these organs in a general light; organs which act in the functions as important a part as the mucous, and which in disease, are almost as frequently affected. Pinel who has perfectly felt the analogy of their in- flammations, has taken this system as the charac- ter of one of the classes of his phlegmasiae. ARTICLE I. Of the Extent, the Forms, and of the Fluid of the Serous System. The serous system occupies the exterior of the major part of organs, which are lined internally p p 2580 i SEROUS SYSTEM. with the mucous : such are the stomach, the intes- tines, the bladder, the lungs, &c. It is found round every one of such as are essential to life, as the brain, the heart, all the gastric viscera, the testes, the bladder, &c. This does not, like the mucous system, form a surface every where continuous over the nume- rous organs it envelopes, but is constantly found isolated in its divers divisions, which have hardly ever any communication together, and the number of these divisions is rather considerable. By in- cluding in one view the different serous surfaces the entire mass is seen to exceed that of the mu- cous surfaces. One single consideration will con- vince us of this: the mucous and serous surfaces attend each other in many parts, as in the sto- mach, the intestines, the lungs, the bladder, the gall bladder, &c. so as to prove nearly of the same extent. But on the one hand, the mucous surfaces reach where the others do not, as in the fossae nasales, the oesophagus, the mouth, &c.; on the other hand, there are a considerable number of serous surfaces existing separately from the mucous, as the pericardium, the tunica arachnoides, &c. Now if the extent of these isolated serous surfaces be compared with that of the mucous surfaces, the one will be found to exceed the other very considerably. These considerations, which might appear trifling, claim however a special attention, on ac-SEKOUS SYS L EM. 581 count of the connexion of functions existing be- tween these two surfaces taken together, a con- nexion that especially relates to the exhalation of albuminous fluids produced by the one, and the secretion of mucous fluids, that exists in the other. However, on examining individually the extent of each serous membrane, from the perito- neum, whose surface is the most extensive, down to the tunica vaginalis, which is the least, consi- derable varieties will be observed. The serous surfaces, considered as a whole, com- pared with the cutaneous surface, also evidently exceed it in width ; so that, in this respect, the quantity of albuminous fluids constantly exhaled within, appears much more considerable than that of the humour habitually expelled by the insen- sible perspiration : in this respect I say, because various circumstances, by increasing the action of the skin, may render these fluids more equal; one of which is returned by absorption to the circu- lation, the other being merely excrementitious. I even doubt if the pulmonary and cutaneous ex- halations united together, are not less than those of the serous surfaces. Every serous membrane presents an imper- forated sac, enveloping the respective organs, and which are sometimes numerous, as in the peri- toneum, at other times single as in the pericar- dium, investing these organs in such a manner as not to be contained within, and which, if it wereSGKOUS SYSTEM. 582 possible to dissect them over their respective sur- faces, would be removed perfectly uninjured. This bag is, in this respect, similar to the double nightcap; a trifling simile, but which, however, conveys a correct idea of the formation of these membranes. From this general disposition, it is easily con- ceived that the serous membranes never open to give passage to the vessels and nerves that pene- trate their respective organs, but that by doubling they constantly attend them to the organs, thus providing them with a sheath, which prevents them from being contained within their cavities; which opposes the infiltration of the serum that lubricates them ; an infiltration which would un- avoidably take place through the adjacent cellular tissue, in dropsies particularly, if, as with the fibrous membranes, they were perforated for the passage of these vessels and nerves. This dispo- sition, exclusivelv remarkable in the membranes now under consideration, and in the synovial membranes, is evident on the vessels that pene- trate the lungs, the spleen, the intestines, the stomach, the testes, &c. This is very conspicu- ously displayed in the tunica arachnoides, a mem- brane essentially serous, as I have proved else- where. From the general idea that has been given of these membranes, it may also be conceived how almost all of them are composed of two distinctSEROUS SYSTEM. 583 parts, although continued and investing, the one, the internal surface of the cavity wherein they are met with, the other the organs of their cavity. Thus, there is a pleura costalis, and a pleura pul- monalis, a double arachnoid membrane ; one part of the peritoneum folded over the gastric or- gans, and the other extended over the abdominal parietes; one part of the pericardium free, and another adhering to the heart. A similar arrange- ment is observed in the testis, &c. Although the serous membranes are separated from each other, yet there sometimes exists communications between them; that, for instance, between the cavities of the epiploon and perito- neum ; that of the arachnoidean cavity, with the cavity of the membrane that lines the ventricles by the canal I have discovered, the external ori- fice of which is seen under, and in the posterior part of the corpus callosum; whilst the internal one is above the pineal gland between the two rows of the small spherical bodies generally met with in this part. i There is but a single instance of continuity between the serous and mucous membranes; namely, between the peritoneum and the uterine surface. How is it that the nature of the two re- spective membranes are changed in this part ?SEKOUb SYSTEM. 584 SECTION I. Free Surface of the Serous Membranes. Every vserous membrane has one of its two surfaces free, the other adhering to the adjacent organ. . The first is remarkable for its polish, which forms a character that especially distin- guishes this system as well as the following, from every other membrane. Every organ that offers this disposition is indebted for it to the envelope- ment from whence it is borrowed. The liver ceases to be smooth and shining in its diaphragm- atic side where the peritoneum forsakes it. There exists in this respect a considerable difference in the aspect of the anterior surface and the posterior part of the coecum. The bladder is rough wherever it is deprived of the peritoneal covering. The cartilages of the ribs have not the polish of those of the articulations invested by the synovial membrane, &c. Does this remarkable property of the serous membranes arise from the compression they undergo? their situation, in parts exposed to continual friction, leads us to believe so. Bordeu has asserted it, when he said “ all the parts of the abdomen are originally irnmerged in cellular tissue, which is subsequently converted into mem- branes by compressionso that the peritoneum is partially formed over every gastric organ, andSEKOUS SYSTEM. 585 the union of its various parts forms the general membrane. According to this author this way of explaining the formation of the peritoneum is applicable to the pleura, the pericardium, and to every similar membrane. But if such were the course nature followed—1st. Why, at whatever age the foetus is examined, are the peritoneum and the serous membranes proportionally as much developed as their corresponding organs ? 2dly. How are the numerous folds of these membranes, as the mesentery, the epiploon, &c. formed? 3dly. Why are there parts in which they are wanting, although these parts are exposed to simi- lar friction as those in which they are observed ? w why, for instance, are the sides of the bladder provided with the peritoneum, whilst its upper part is lined with it ? 4thly. Why is there no serous membrane formed round the large vessels of the arm, of the thigh, &c.s which impress evi- dent motion on the adjacent organs ? why is not the thickness of the serous membranes increased in such parts as are intended for more consider- able motion, and reduced in those calculated for less? 5thly. Why, for instance, is the tunica vaginalis equal in thickness to the pericardium? Gthly. How is it possible that friction should create an organized body within, .whilst externally it always destroys the epidermis ? 7thly. How could the vascular and lymphatic texture of the serous membranes be allied to this supposed origin by586 SEROUS SYSTEM. pressure ? The impossibility of resolving these questions, sufficiently proves it is not to any mechanical pressure, that both the production and the polish of the surfaces of the serous mem- branes should be attributed ; that their origin is the same as that of every other organ ; that in common with them they originate and are deve- loped ; that this polish is an evident result of their organisation, as the mucous papillae are de- pendent on the texture of the surfaces to which they belong. What would be thought of a system in which these papillae should be attributed to the pressure of food upon the stomach, of urine upon the bladder, of air upon the pituitary membrane, &c. The free surface of the serous membranes com- pletely separates the adjoining organs, over which these membranes are spread, so that these organs find in them actual limits, barriers, if I may be allowed the expression, or integuments, very dif- ferent, however, from those on the outward surface of the body": we should remark, in fact, that all the important viscera, the heart, the lungs, the brain, the gastric organs, the testes, &c. are confined by their serous envelope, suspended in the middle of the bag they form, and communi- cating with the adjacent parts, by that only through which their vessels penetrate. This isolated position, perfectly coincides with that separate mode of vitality observed in every587 SEKOUS SYSTEM. organ, particularly in those we have just been noticing. Each is possessed of a vitality proper to itself, which is the result of a peculiar modification of its vital powers; a modification which necessarily commands one in circulation, nutrition, and temperature. In no part, what- ever, are the sensation, motion and process of nutrition perfectly alike, unless they both belong to the same system ; each organ performs, on a minute scale, the phenomena effected at large in the economy; each selects in the circulatory tide the nutritive substance proper to it, digests that food, rejects into the mass of the blood the heterogeneous part of it, and appropriates that fit for its nutrition: it is digestion in miniature. The * ancients, no doubt, intended to convey an idea of that truth, so brilliantly illustrated by Bordeu, that the womb was an animal living within another. It is then a very important use of the serous membranes to contribute to the indepen- dence of the vital powers and functions of different parts, by separating the respective or- gans. Let us not forget to consider under the same point of view, the damp atmosphere that inces- santly surrounds them, an atmosphere analogous to that formed by the cellular tissue round vari- ous other organs : in this atmosphere every mor- bid emanation from the organ is lost, without reaching the others. In the cellular systemSEROUS SYSTEM. 588 we have sometimes found this atmosphere, the focus of very different phenomena, and transmit- ting diseases from one organ to another, hut then the serous membranes constantly oppose a more immoveable obstacle, because there is rio commu- nication by filaments with other organs, they are merely connected with the organs they invest. It rarely happens that a disease of the liver is extended to the intestines, of the spleen to the stomach, &c. The polish of the free surface of the serous system facilitates in a remarkable degree, the motions of the organs it invests. We have already observed that nature had secured two essential means of fulfilling this end, namely the membrane and the cellular tissue. As the exterior is provided with the latter of these means, the interior is especially provided with the former. These internal motions are generally considered too abstractedly, and merely as they relate to the functions of the organs by which they are performed, in respect to circulation for the heart, to respiration for the lungs, to digestion for the stomach, &c. But they should also be viewed in a general light; they ought to be considered as conveying to the machine a continual excitation which sustains, and stimulates the action and power of every organ, of the head, of the chest, and ot the abdomen ; which receive less forcibly than the organs ol the limbs, the influence of589 SEROUS SYSTEM. external motion. It is by these internal motions the phenomena of nutrition are excited, con- tinued and developed; as outwardly; the motions of the arms, thighs, <fcc., promote the nutrition of the muscles of these parts; as is evidently seen in the baker, the mechanic, or any other artist, that generally exercises one part in preference to ano- ther. Thus it is that the serous membranes con- tribute indirectly to the nutrition and growth of their respective viscera; but they have never any direct influence over nutrition, because their organization and vitality differ from the vitality and organization of these organs. The free surface of the serous system, essen- tially differs from that of the mucous, in its dispo- sition to form adhesions. The pleura, above all, is that in which these adhesions are the most striking. Dissections prove that there are nearly as many instances of its existence, as of the contrary state. Next in rank com.es the perito- neum, then the pericardium, subsequently the tunica vaginalis testis; and finally, the tunica arachnoides is that which is less frequently found to contract adhesions, although I have seen some instances of it. These adhesions, which may be perfectly investigated in the pleura, admit of considerable varieties, which are as fol- lows : 1st. Sometimes the costal and pulmonary parts are so completely identified with each other, notSEROUS SYSTEM. 590 only at several points, but even in their whole extent, as to form one single membrane, as firmly attached as in the two divisions of the lip, when the operation of the harelip has succeeded. 2dly. At other times the adhesion is so very slight, that the least attempt is sufficient to destroy it. I have frequently ascertained this in the pericardium; and when I was operative surgeon at the Hotel Dieu, I once observed it in the tunica vaginalis of a man in whom this membrane had been injected for hydrocele. When separated the two surfaces are uneven, they have lost their polish. 3dly. Between the costal and pulmonary part of the pleura, between the surfaces of the peritoneum, &c., divers prolongations are observed more or less extended, forming a kind of loops, which are loose, crossing the serous cavity, having the same organization, the very same polish as the membrane of which they seem to be a kind of fold, containing internally a kind of small canal, because they are formed of two sheets perfectly resembling that extension of the synovial membrane of the knee, which, from the posterior part of the patella projects to the interstice of the condyles, bearing also an appearance similar to that of divers natural folds of the peritoneum. It is hardly possi- ble to conceive how filaments, so very regu- larly organized, could result from inflammation. I rather suspect they are owing to original con-591 SEKOUS SYSTEM. formation, lthly. Between the two parts of the pleura, a number of other extensions very dis- tinct are frequently observed; they are not smooth, form no tubes, but appear like flakes, and per- fectly similar to the cellular points; so that wherever they are met with, one might think the membrane has been completely converted into this tissue, which besides, as we shall find, is the essential basis of its organization. 5thly. I am not speaking of the adhesions effected by the false membranes, by the albuminous flakes situate between two parts of a serous surface, &c. Such adhesions are in some degree unconnected with these surfaces. SECTION II. Adherent Surface of the Serous System. The external surface of the serous membranes adheres nearly everywhere to the adjacent organs: these membranes are rarely found isolated on both sides. The tunica arachnoides in the basis of the cranium, and a few others are excep- tions. This adhesion of the serous membranes is perfectly distinct from that of the fibrous mem- branes. In this the crossing of the vessels, so completely unites the two parts together, that they seem to share the same organization, so that when one is removed the other generally dies, as is seen in respect to the periosteum, and theSEROUS SYSTEM. 592 bone, &c. Every serous membrane, on the con- trary, is nearly foreign to the organ it invests ; their respective organizations are not connected, as the following lines will prove: 1st. These membranes are frequently seen alter- nately to forsake or invest their respective organs. Thus the wide ligaments, considerably distanced from the womb in the natural state fulfil the office of a serous membrane during pregnancy. The intestine on distending, borrows from the mesentery an envelopement it separates from on contracting. The omentum, as Chaussier has judi- ciously observed, is alternately a floating mem- brane in the abdomen, or a covering for the sto- mach; frequently the peritoneal covering of the bladder nearly forsakes it. Did not the her- nial bag of these enormous protrusions of the gastric viscera originally line the parietes of the abdomen, &c. ? Now, it must be evident, that since the various organs can exist, separate from their serous membranes, there is no con- nexion between their reciprocal organizations 2dly. They are constantly united by a loose tissue easily stretched in every direction, and never by vessels as in the major part of other adhesions. 3dly. The affection of an organ is not an indis- pensable consequence of that of its serous mem- brane ; and reciprocally the organ is frequently diseased, and the membrane continued healthy; for instance in the operation for hydrocele, the593 SEROUS SYSTEM. testis in general is left uninjured amidst the inflammation of the tunica vaginalis. The inflam- mation of the intestines is not a consequence of that of their peritoneal covering; and in the various acute catarrhal affections of organs in- wardly provided with mucous surfaces, and outwardly supplied with serous membranes, these are not seen inflamed, &c. In a word, the diseases of the mucous membranes are every where per- fectly distinct from those of the serous, although in general both contribute to the structure of the same organ. It is evident that so distinctive a line of demarcation between their affections must unavoidably suppose one between their organiza- tions. The life of their serous membranes is then completely distinct from that of their corre- sponding organs. There are cases, however, wherein these kind of membranes are so firmly attached to the organs they line, that frequently the sharpest knife will not separate them. We observe this between the tunica vaginalis testis and the tunica albuginea, the tunica arachnoides and the dura-mater, and between other membranes which form what I have called the sero-fibrous, &c. Such is the connexion between these surfaces that to this very day many have been mistaken for a single membrane. However there is no more identity of organization than where the serous membranes are more slightly united to their respective VOL. II Q Q594 SEROUS SYSTEM. organs, as is seen in the peritoneum, in the pleura, &c. This distinction is sometimes made very striking by disease. I have seen the tunica ,V; arachnoides in a corpse evidently attached to the internal surface of the dura-mater, without this »-i# having undergone the least alteration: it was easily removed and lacerated with the utmost facility. SECTION III. Serous Fluids. The internal surface of all the serous mem- branes is moistened with a fluid nearly re- sembling the serum of the blood. This fluid is incessantly poured out by the exhalents, and constantly taken up by the absorbents. Its quan- tity varies ; merely a dew in the natural state, it evaporates whenever the serous membranes laid bare suffer the air to dissolve it. It is generally more abundant in the corpse than in the living subject, because the transudation prevented by the tonic powers is then easily prevented on account of the loss of these powers, and is sub- stituted to vital exhalation, in mechanically trans- mitting, by their weight, the fluids of the ad- joining organs to the different serous cavities; and because this very decline of the tonic powers prevents any kind of absorption whatever; hence, the stagnation, the accumulation of this fluich595 ST ROUS SYSTEM. How far its quantity in clivers dropsies, particu- larly in those of the abdomen, may be increased is sufficiently shown. Does not this quantityvary according to the state of the organs enveloped by the serous membranes? It has long been said that synovia was more abundantly exhaled during the motion of the articu- lations than during rest. I have nothing to pro- duce in this respect grounded upon experiment; but I can affirm, having repeatedly ascertained it in living animals, that the exhalation of the serous surface of the abdomen is not increased during digestion, or at least, that if this happen to be the case, absorption becomes more active, and thus, that the peritoneum is not damper than at any other time. I have opened the chest of a number of young guinea pigs, after I had made them run for some length of time round a room to accelerate respiration ; but I did not find that the pleura was moister than usual; yet it cannot be questioned, as we shall see, that the quantity of serous fluids varies astonishingly in the different acute diseases; and that the exhalant surfaces pour out more or less of this fluid according to the way in which they may be sympathetically affected. I In the first periods of inflammations, when the exhalents are filled with blood, accidentally admitted, serum flows no longer from their free surface. Then, as they are exquisitely q q 2596 SEROUS SYSTEM. sensible and very dry, the motions of the organs they invest are remarkably painful. It is during these first periods the adhesions take place: if they do not form either on account of motion, or from any other reason, and if the inflammation does not subside by resolution, then what happens in an open wound takes place in the serous surfaces; they suppurate. Now this suppuration is never attended with ulceration and erosion of their substance. Let their purulent collections be ever so considerable, these mem- branes will constantly remain uninjured; their tissue will only be more or less thickened: they emit pus in the same way as their natural serous fluids, that is to say by exhalation! How much the consistence of this fluid varies from the lacteal serum to the false membrane, the thickest and the most adherent to the surface from which its materials have been exhaled, is sufficiently known. The fluids of the serous system are most evi- dently of an albuminous nature. The instant a membrane of this system is immersed in boiling water, I have observed a whitish layer form over it; it is concrete albumine, which, on being soon after removed, leaves to the surface nearly its primitive hue. All substances calculated to coagulate albumine form a similar layer over the serous surfaces. Their albuminous nature is con- firmed by the experiments of Hewson, who had collected a few spoonfulls of these fluids from597 SEROUS S\STEM. large animals. Ruelle and Fourcroy, who have analyzed the water of dropsical subjects, have also found albumin© predominate. Let it be remarked that all the whitish flakes, floating over that water, that the fake membranes which form in it, and the white fluids that thicken it, so even as to give it a milk-like appearance, appear to be nothing else than albumine in different degrees of consistence. It might be thought that the heat of inflammation has produced, during life, the same phenomenon as caloric produces on the white of egg, on the fluid of dropsies, &c. I shall pass unnoticed the other accessory principles which enter into the composition of the serous fluids. ARTICLE II. Organization of the Serous System, A whitish hue, shining not quite so bright as that of an aponeurosis; variable in thickness, ob- viously displayed in the liver, the heart, the intestines, &c., scarcely observable in the tunica arachnoides, the spleen, &c. ; a remarkable trans- parency whenever these membranes are removed in some considerable extent, or when thev are examined in parts; whereas in the spleen both their surfaces are free ; such are the primitive characters of their structure. All are composed of a single sheet, whichSEROUS SYSTEM. 698 where it is thick may be separated into cellular layers, But which can never, as the mucous mem- branes, be neatly divided into two or three parts. The action of cantharides applied over their external surface, first laid bare, for instance, over a part of an intestine outwardly secured in a living animal, will not, as upon the skin, raise a serous vesicle. I have frequently made this ex- periment. What is the immediate structure of this single sheet of the^nasesus membranes? Let us examine it. section r. Cellular Nature of the Serous Tissue. Every system, in general, forms, as we have seen, an assemblage. 1st. Of parts in common, which are especially the cellular tissue, blood vessels, exhalents, absorbents, and nerves, form- ing, as we have said before, the basis. 2dly. Of a particular fibre formed of a substance which is deposited within, for instance, of gelatine for the cartilages, of gelatine and phosphate of lime for the bones, of fibrine for the muscles, &c. The cellular tissue then, the blood vessels, and the nerves are the fabric of the organs, their differ- ence depending upon their proper tissue, a tissue which itself depends upon a nutritive substance also proper to the organ. A bone would be con- verted into a muscle, if, without changing itsSEUOUS SYSTEM. 599 texture in the least, instead of separating phos- phate of lime, and impregnating itself with it, nature had endowed it with the faculty of secret- ing fibrine and incrusting itself with it. Now the serous system seems to have no distinct nutri- tive matter, and consequently no specific tissue, it is moulded as the others, and is not penetrated with any substance that characterizes it. Nearly every where cellular, it only differs from the cellular tissue in being more condensed, its cellulae in the ordinary state being placed at greater dis- tances. That this texture is really cellular rests upon the following proofs: 1st. The structure must be similar whenever we find identity in functions and affections ; now it is evident that the uses of these membranes and of the cellular tissue, in respect to the continual absorption and exhala- tion of lymph, are perfectly the same, and that they absolutely share in common the phenomena of dropsies; with this distinction only, that in the one the fluid is poured upon the surface, in the other it is infiltrated. 2dly. By inflating the tissue beneath, their cellular structure is rendered more apparent, particularly when the air has passed readily, an experiment frequently attended with difficulty. 3dly. Maceration, in the course of time, as Haller has judiciously observed, will produce the same effect, but still more evidently. The different kinds of cysts, hydatides, &c., the600 / SEROUS SYSTEM. aspect, the texture, and even the very nature of which, are absolutely the same (as we have seen) as in the serous membranes, always arise amidst the cellular tissue, grow at its expence, and are completely formed by it. 4thly. No fibres are ever met with in the serous membranes; a dis- tinctive character of the other organs, and similar to that of the cellular tissue. To these divers proofs of analogy between the cellular and serous systems, might be added the action of the different re-agents, the results of which are perfectly similar in both. 1st. Every serous membrane after having undergone desicca- tion becomes transparent, but never yellow like the fibrous membranes : they retain a suppleness never met with in these last membranes, nor in the mucous that have undergone the same prepa- ration, and will by degrees re-assume their primi- tive state on being again immersed in water. 2dly. They do not so easily yield to putrefaction as the mucous surfaces, the muscular layers, the glands, Ac. This is particularly remarkable in the abdomen, on the peritoneum often left almost completely healthy, whilst every thing around is putrefied, as may be ascertained by removing it; for the transparency, if examined on the fleshy and. mucous layers, might at first glauce lead us to suppose it is injured. 3dly. In the gene- ral temperature of cellars the serous membranes cannot be reduced to a pulpous state by mace-SEROUS SYSTEM. 601 ation without the utmost difficulty. In my experiments, the slightest, the thinnest of these membranes, that of the spleen, has resisted it for a considerable length of time. This phenomenon is particularly striking when compared with the maceration of tendonsthatare so very resistant,and which during life bear such considerable strains. These have already been reduced by water into a pulp, when the epiploon is still left unaffected. The other serous membranes possess a similar property. 4thly. As the fibrous system, these surfaces shrink in hot water, but they yield much less gelatine ; like this they do not turn yellow. The pleura with the parts of the breast of ani- mals brought on our tables nearly retains its usual appearance ; it is only rather more tarnished, has been stript of the power of shrinking under the action of caloric, and can no longer be acted upon in the same manner by acids, &c. Had this membrane been of a fibrous nature, it would, on account of its tenuitv, have been diffused into gelatine, and the same may be said of the external membranes of the spleen, of the liver, of the lungs, dressed for our meals. Let us only com- pare on our tables the boiled meats, the intermus- cular aponeurosis, tendons, &c. and we shall find it is impossible to confound all the white tissues together as the chymists have done. If the different effects from the action of agents we are more familiar with upon the serous system602 SEROUS SYSTEM. be compared with such as have been observed to operate upon the cellular system, we shall find them to be perfectly the same ; consequently that these two systems are analogous, nay identical. On putrefying in the air, the serous system does not, like the skin, assume a green aspect, it becomes tarnished, and of a very deep grey ; during life, on the contrary, its black hue is very obvious in gangrene, resulting, sometimes, from acute inflammation, at other times from those chronic inflammations, attended with a rash of small whitish tubercles, so frequently observed over these membranes. This difference proceeds from these surfaces not being in the corpse per- meated with blood at the moment they are in- vaded by putrescency, whilst they contain a quantity of this fluid in the living subject when putrescency is a consequence of the inflammation by which the exhalents have been filled. A number of other facts, besides, have proved that the more the blood contained in a part when vaded by putrescency, the more that part will become livid and black. In the numerous sub- jects I have already opened, I have only observed gangrene in the peritoneum; I have never met with it in the pleura, the tunica arachnoides, the pericardium, and the tunica vaginalis testis. These are no doubt liable to gangrene ; but I have, I believe, opened a sufficient number of subjects,603 SEROUS SYSTEM. to state, as a general principle, that the perito- neum is above all serous membranes the most liable to it. Notwithstanding that the utmost analogy be- tween the cellular and serous systems is proved, by the considerations above-mentioned, yet there is still a real difference. In the first place, their exterior appearance is not the same: then there is something in their intimate nature we are unacquainted with, and which also differs; for whenever two organs are similar in structure, they are liable to the very same affections. Now there is a disease of the serous surfaces which is never observed in the cellular system ; I mean those inflammations slow in their progress, and which I have just mentioned, a disease that ought rather to be ranked in any other class than that of phlegmasiae, and which is particularly characterized by the small tubercles attendant upon it. Authors who have not paid a sufficient attention to this affection, have termed it chroyic enteritis in the peritoneum, chronic inflammation in the pleura, &c. although per- fectly unconnected with any subjacent organ, except at an advanced period ; when it is propa- gated through the cellular tissue, it is exclusively seated in the serous membranes, and is an affec- tion proper to these membranes; as the miliary eruptions are to the cutaneous surface, and aphthae to the mucous, &c. To these distinctionsSEROUS SYSTEM. 604 may be added that of pus flowing from the cellular tissue and the serous surfaces; this fluid is not the same in both systems. We are unac- quainted with its difference of nature, but its exterior appearance is by no means the same. ' SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Serous System. Exh tl< nts. There is a constant exhalation from the serous surfaces. Vessels of a particular order are the agents of this exhalation, the materials of which is the fluid already mentioned ; these vessels are remarkably obvious in this system : it ' is the onlv one in which the anatomist can trace them distinctly; the following method will enable us to take a perfect view of them; 1st. Let a portion of intestine be drawn from the abdomen of a living animal, it will be found of a pinky hue, owing to the vessels beneath the serous layer, and hardly any vessels at all in that very layer will be seen. Let the intestine be irri- tated, and returned after having fixed it with a thread, as in the operation for hernia, accom- panied with gangrene, and at the end of thirty- six or forty-eight hours let it be withdrawn again; you will observe a multiplicity of red strise over-running that serous surface, and60,5 SEROCJS SYSTEM obviously displaying the exhalents which were inscrutable in the natural state on account of the transparency of their fluids. 2ndly. When injected with very liquid fluids the serous surfaces are instantly covered with innumerable striae, of the same colour as the injected fluid, which are evidently exhalents filled with that fluid. Sdly. Whilst injecting, a fluid is often poured from the smooth surface of the serous membranes without laceration : this fluid does not transude, but is furnished by the exhalents. 4thly. If a serous surface be laid bare in a living animal and wiped dry, it will soon after be again covered with serum from the exhalents. Absorbents. From the texture of the serous membrane, it is evident that the lymphatic system essentially contributes to their formation; that they are probably nothing else than an interlacement of absorbents and exhalents; for we have ascer- tained that the cellular organ is an assemblage of them. But this assertion, dictated by analogy, is also supported by substantial proofs: 1st. The fluids of dropsy in the divers cavities varies in density and colour : now Mascagni has constantly observed that the neighbouring lymphatics con- tained a fluid perfectly similar. 2dly. The same author has observed in two different bodies effusions in the chest where the absorbents of theSEROUS SYSTEM. 606 lungs were gorged with blood. 3dly. In a man who had become emphysematous in consequence of having been poisoned, these organs were found inflated. 4thly. Injected in the abdomen or in the peritoneum, coloured fluids were soon after found, it is said, in the adjacent lymphatics. I have repeatedly made this experiment: the fluid was soon absorbed, but not with the colour- ing matter ; so that in this substance, more con- densed subsequent to absorption, the serous sur- face and the lymphatics remained transparent as before. In general the abdomen should be selected for these kind of experiments, because almost bare over the liver, the absorbents are more easily investigated. This absorbent faculty is continued some time after death; but to insure success, the animal, if possessed of warm blood, should be kept in a bath nearly of the same temperature ; I have had frequent oppor- tunities of ascertaining this truth, and of observ- ing with Cruikshank, that what Mascagni says respecting the absorption of human bodies, fifteen, thirty, even forty-eight hours after death, was at least excessively exaggerated. 5thly. Every year I make the following experiment to demon- strate the absorbents; I macerate in water during five or six hours the heart of a bullock ; the serous membrane of that organ, which before hardly exhibited any of these organs, appears covered with them. 6thly. When the serous607 SEKOUS SYSTEM. membranes are inflamed, the subjacent lympha- tics are seen distended in the same manner as those with the red globules of the blood, &c. It appears evident thpn : lstly. That the ab- sorbents open in innumerable Orifices over the serous membranes: 2dly. That their roots, a thousand times interwoven together, and with the orifices of the exhalents, especially contribute to form their tissue: 3dly. That the difficulty of distin- guishing the pores of the absorbents and exhalents over the surfaces is not a sufficient reason for de- nying their existence ; this difficulty arising from their excessive tenuity, and the oblique direction in which they open between the sheets of these mem- branes. Thus the obliquity of Warthon’s duct at its insertion, or of the ductus choledocus, renders it very difficult to discover them, although these ducts are much more considerable : 4thly. That from this structure, the serous membranes should be consi dered invariably disposed, as we have seen, in the form of imperforated bags, as large reservoirs in- terposed between the exhalents and absorbents, in which the lymph on passing from the one stagnates for some time before it enters the other, wherein it undoubtedly undergoes some changes which we shall never be able to in- vestigate, because it would be necessary to com- pare the fluids of both these vessels, which is almost impossible, at least in respect to the former; and finally, wherein it is intended for different608 SEROUS SYSTEM. uses in respect to the organs it surrounds with a damp atmosphere. Blood Vessels. Are the blood vessels integral parts in the structure of the serous membranes? They are very numerous round these organs, as is seen in the peritoneum, the pericardium, the pleurae, &c., they twine on the external surface and ramify over it. But I have always doubted that the greatest num- ber of such as are thus contiguous to them formed integral parts of their tissue, I am even convinced of the contrary, and my opinion is supported by the following considerations: lstly. In cases where these vessels are injected, they are easily removed by the scalpel from the external surface of these membranes, without destroying their continuity, which can never be effected in the fibrous and mucous membranes: 2dly. On examining these membranes, where they are free in both their surfaces no blood vessel is seen. The tunica arach- noides in the basis of the skull affords an instance of it: 3dlv. The vessels frequently change their con- nections with these membranes. I have already proved that whenever the omentum is applied to the full stomach, the vessels contained between its layers do not draw up along with it over this viscus, because they are prevented by the great coronary branch. The vessels when injected are never seen to project as usual below theSEROUS SYSTEM. 609 along with them in their change of position during ■■i hernial sac- Those observed in the wide li- gaments of the uterus are certainly not drawn pregnancy, I rather think it probable then, that the serous membranes are possessed of a small number of blood vessels only; that ‘what are generally called arteries of the peritoneum, of the pleura, &c. are no more than trunks twining over their external surface, susceptible of being detached whenever these membranes are displaced, being connected with them, and not concerned in their structure, in which the absorbents, exhalents and cellular tissue, almost exclusively contribute. Undoubtedly there are communications between the arterial system and the serous membranes, through the exhalenis; but nothing respecting the nature, the disposition, and even in some degree to the functions of these vessels, has yet been cor- rectly ascertained. i • section in. Varieties in the Organization of ike Serous 'System* We have seen that the mucous system presents in every part numerous distinctions of structure, and that it is never the same in any region or or- gan whatever. The serous system also varies; less so, however, than the preceding : 1st. Each Tnemhrane has its peculiar structure. Let, for Ikk von. nu U ItSEROUS SYSTEM. 610 stance, the peritoneum and the tunica arachnoides he compared ; the one thin, nice and transparent, will yield at the slightest attempt, opposes no re- sistance, and lacerates almost as soon as it is touched, is never left entire in the basis of the skull if the brain be ever so slightly elevated, and is found remarkably soft, on' being pressed between the fingers. Denser and thicker, the other resists without being ruptured, every effort imparted to the abdominal viscera. It may be drawn out without danger, and its texture is quite different. 2dly. The different parts of the serous membranes are differently organized ; the spleen, for instance, is evidently an appendage of the peritoneum, and yet it does not resemble it. I have observed that the intestinal part of this membrane is much thinner than the hepatic and mesenteric divisions, &c. That half of the tunica vaginilis, which is con- nected with the tunica albuginia is certainly not the same as the other half, free towards the dartos, &c. It is impossible for me to say precisely what these differences consist in ; but they are suffi- ciently indicated by their external appearance. Should we be surprised then, if all the serous surfaces are not equally liable to the same dis- eases; if their inflammation presents varieties; if ten are ascertained in the pleura, to one in the tu- nica arachnoides; if they are not attended with the same symptoms in the pericardium, the tunica vaginalis, and the peritoneum; if dropsies vary k611 SEROUS SYSTEM, so much ; not to be noticed in each, &c. ? The pericardium is liable to an affection I have observed in no other serous membrane ; it consists of white lamellae, more or less ex- tended, and forming over the internal surface, which on a first glance might bethought inherent in their tissue, but which may however be re- moved without injuring it. I am ignorant how these lamellae are produced : do they correspond to those of the false membranes of the pleura ? Neither should we be surprised at what has been said respecting the varieties observed in diseases. The whole of the peritoneum is frequently dis- eased, and the spleen remains healthy, &c. The lamellae I have just been speaking of are only seen upon the free surface of the pericardium, &c. Let it be remarked, however, that every dis- ease of this system bears a common character, evidently derived from analogy of organization. This system and the synovial, are the only ones in which rather considerable serous collections form, and in which slow and tubercular inflammations are produced. To this exclusively belongs the major part of its peculiar modes of adhesion. In- flammation has a peculiar and distinctive character in all the serous surfaces. That of the meninges, from analogy of symptoms was ranked amongst the serous phlegmasiee long before I had demonstrated that the tunica arachnoides essentially belonged to the serous system. It is to this membrane, and not R R 2612 SEROUS SYSTEM. the dura-mater, which is of a fibrous nature, that phrenzy should be referred of the diaphanous membranes, &c. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Serous System. SECTION i. Properties of the Tissue. Extensibility. The serous membranes are not endowed with such a considerable degree of extensibility, as might at first be conceived from the enormous di- latations they are in some cases susceptible of. This is obviously proved by the mechanism of their dilatations. This mechanism depends upon three essential causes: Isfcly. The developement of the plicae it forms, and this is the most effectual of the three causes. This is the reason the perito- neum is of all the membranes of this class, the most exposed to dilatations in pregnancy,from ascites and obstructions of the viscera, more frequent there than in any other part; this is the reason why the peri- toneum displays such a considerable number of these folds, such as the mesentery, the mesocolon, the me* ' sorectum, the large and small omentum, the fatty appendages, the fold of the appendicula cceci, the wide ligaments of the uterus, those posterior to the bladder, &c. &c. This also explains why these folds are particularly observed round such organs613 SEROUS SYSTEM, as are liable to habitual and alternate dilatation and contraction ; as round the stomach, the intes- tines, the uterus and the bladder ; very obvious in the first state, they are hardly observable in the second. 2dly. The great size of the serous cavities accords with the displacements of which their membranes are susceptible. Thus, when the liver is considerably increased its serous membrane also partly increases at the ex pence of that of the dia- phragm, which by being drawn ou tis separated, and directly applied over the obstructed viscus. In an aneurism of the heart, I have seen the peri- cardium, which could not allow of sufficient disten- sion, partly loosened from the portion of large vessels it covered. 3dly and finally. The tissue of these membranes is really distended in every direction, but this is in general the least striking cause of the increase of their cavities; it is only when these are rather considerable that they exer- cise over them a powerful influence ; in ordinary cases the two first causes are generally sufficient. I shall state one important observation respect- ing the change of position displayed during the motions of their respective organs; it is that these displacements are attended with the most acute pain ; when these membranes are inflamed, when the intestines, in a state of dilatation, separate the two diseased sheets of the mesentery, to pass be- tween, when the stomach forces itself between those of the omentum, whenever the peritoneumserous system. 614 ]s inflamed, the patient undergoes inexpressible pain. This explains why accumulation of air is so very painful; why too large a quantity of be- verage should be avoided. The acute pain at- tendant upon strong inspiration in pleurisy is suf- ficiently known ; it proceeds from the lungs di- lating the pleura, and tending to force itself be- tween the folds attending the large pulmonary vessels, &c. Contractility. It corresponds to the extensibility; conse- quently is less than would appear at first; for in- stance, when the peritoneum contracts, it again forms different folds, it re-assumes the state it had- forsaken by undergoing locomotion, &c. It can- not be denied, however, that these two properties are most obvious in considerable dilatations; in hydrocele, for instance, in proportion as the water flows, the tunica vaginalis visibly contracts. The same phenomenon is observed when, under similar circumstances, the peritoneum is punctured. At the moment emphysema is produced, the pleura does not undergo this phenomenon in so striking a degree, not from a deficiency of contractility, but because it adheres to the sides which do not contract, and if the fluid has been long effused, the lungs are so compressed that they can be no longer dilated by air, so that there is a vacancy left between the costal and pulmonary portions,SEHOIJS SYSTEM. 615 a vacancy filled with air. If the serum in hydro- cephalus were evacuated, a similar void would be left at the moment of the operation : subsequent to long distensions, the serous membranes will not so effectually contract as before ; after being re- peatedlv punctured the tunica vaginalis remains flabby, also the peritoneum after a succession of pregnancies, &c. SECTION II. Vital Properties. Secured from the mechanical action of out- ward bodies, the serous surfaces do not enjoy in the natural state those properties that connect living organs with exterior forms; they have neither animal sensibility nor animal contractility, so that they would be completely unfit to fulfil the office of external integuments, or to line the organs clothed by the mucous membranes; they could in fact convey no other sensation' but that of a dull and obscure touch. They actually form envelopements for the internal organ, but these are not endowed with sensibility. The proof is, that in living animals these membranes are in- effectually irritated. I have frequently seen dogs, when I have left their spleen out of the abdomen to study the phenomena, themselves tearing of that organ, though in a state perfectly calm, eat it, and thus fed upon their own substance. In ex-616 SEROUS SYSTEM. periinents in which part of their intestines are left out, they are also seen, if left loose for a few mo- ments, to tear them without any visible pain. Whenever the serous system comes in contact with external bodies,, their natural state is altered ; they inflame, as is seen when the peritoneum, and the tunica vaginalis testis are laid bare ; as is also observed whenever a foreign body is introduced * and acts upon them. To effect these artificial ad- hesions between the parietiesof these membranes, physicians frequently resort to these means, which would be ineffectual in the mucous membranes. The different morbific irritations much more fre- quently inflame the serous surfaces, which, in that state acquire a very, high degree of sensibility, supe- rior even to that of the integuments; so that these surfaces when inflamed, would be equally unfit for integuments, because they would be painfully affected by external bodies. Sensible organic contractility is wanting in the serous system ; but the other corresponding pro- perties are in permanent action: 1st. In the ha- bitual exhalation and absorption carried on in this system : 2dly. In nutrition, the latter properties then predominate in this system; thus is it that all their diseases are connected with them ; the acute and chronic inflammations, attended with tubercles, adhesions, dropsies, exhalation of pus, lacteal serum, &c., all proceed from excess, defi- ciency, or adulteration in these two properties ofSEROUS SYSTEM* 617 the serous system. These are also the properties almost exclusively brought into play in sympathies^ so that whenever either idiopathically or sympa- thetically diseased, the serous membranes always present a series of phenomena which all suppose* either an increased internal motion, or a loss of energy in the capillary vessels, exhalents, ab- sorbents, and in the tissue proper to these mem- branes ; whilst in the muscular systems of animal and organic life, &c. these predominating affec- tions, manifested by convulsions and paralysis in the one, by irregular motions of irritability in the other, do not suppose such interior alteration in the tissue of the ' diseased organ. This explains why these two last systems, though frequently affected during life, hardly disclose any changes on dissection, whilst the serous system opens to* the physician a remarkably extensive field for pa- thological anatomy. The serous surfaces are very susceptible of being influenced by the affections of the other organs this is particularly obvious in the organic diseases of the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, stomach, uterus,, &c., organs which, without any known connection of functions with the serous surfaces, influence however to such a degree, that all their morbific injuries of organization are attended in their last periods with different serous collections in theSEROUS SYSTEM. 618 large cavities, collections evidently owing to some- defect of the organs that habitually exhale this fluid. I shall make two observations in,this re- spect : the first is, that the serous membranes nearest to the diseased organ, are in general the most liable to be influenced by that organ. Thus in the diseases of the heart and l;ungs, collections of serum are apt to form in the chest, whilst acites is constantly the first result of obstructions of the liver, spleen, &c.: the pleura and pericardium only fill subsequently. We are aware that the major part of saricoceles are complicated with dropsies of the tunica vaginalis testis ; a disease which sur- geons consider abstractedly ; but it is the same as those of the preceding cases, which in this respect might be called hydro-phthisis, chronic hydro-hepatitis, hydro-carcinoma of the ute- rus, &c. The second observation is, that whenever serum thus accumulates in the cavities, in consequence of any organic injury sustained by a viscus foreign to the membrane this serum is limpid, transparent, and probably of the same nature as that circulated in the lymphatic vessels. The exhalents it is composed of not being actually diseased, their action being increased, or that of the absorbents reduced by sympathy only, the fluid must remain the same. Thus, although the presence of a stone in the bladder causes pain at the extremity of the glands, the penis is per-619 SEROVS SYSTEM* fectlv healthy, and the mucous fluid proceeding- from it is of the same nature as in the ordinary state. In dropsies, on the contrary, produced from a disease of the tissue of the serous surfaces, from a tubercular inflammation for instance, or from acute inflammation, &c., that has degene- rated, the effused serum is generally adulterated ; it is either lactescent, or displays albuminous flakes, or a false membrane is the result, &c. This ob- servation, which I consider interesting, has struck me almost as frequently as I have opened subjects. In acute diseases also, the serous surfaces equally receive the sympathetic influence from the affected organs. If they could be seen then we should find them like the skin, more or less damp or dry, according to the different periods of the disease. The proof is, that at the time of death in which the disease terminates, the serum of the pleura, of the pericardium, of the peritoneum, &e.; varies in an astonishing degree. Sometimes it is obviously increased, at other times it is almost null: this depends upon the time when death took place. If at that time exhalation is very abundant, a quantity of serum is found ; hardly any is seen when life has been continued long enough for absorption to be effected. If the perspiration were not dissolved by the surrounding air, or if the skin were disposed in the form of a bag in the same manner as the serous surfaces, we should find it in very different degrees of mois-620 SE KOU H SYSTEM. ture accordingly as the subject had died when the cutaneous exhalation was increased or sup- pressed, ARTICLE IV. Developement of the Serous System. SECTION i. State of this System in very early Life. In the foetus all the serous surfaces are exces- sively thin. On opening the chest by a longitu- dinal section of the sternum, and examining the pleura of the mediastinum, where it is free on both sides, it is found thinner than the transpa- rent sheet of the omentum or of the tunica arach- noides in the adult. The peritoneum is rather thicker, but its tenuity is still very striking. As to the omentum and the tunica arachnoides, a correct idea of the excessive tenuity of their tissue will hardly be conveyed by comparing them with that of the bubble, formed with soap and water. At this period, the fluid by which the serous membranes are lubricated, is much more unctuous and viscid than at the subsequent stages; by passing the fingers over these surfaces at different ages, the distinction will be easily felt. One might almost think that the tactile qualities ofSEROUS SYSTEM. 621 serous fluids, border then upon those of synovia. I cannot account for this difference. Besides this fluid does not appear proportionally so abundant as that of the cellular fluids, with which, however, it bears so much analogy; this is probably owing to the internal motions being less numerous; considering the inactive state of the major part of the organic muscles, less fluid is required to lubricate the surfaces. The increase of the serous system is always in proportion to that of the organs it is intended to receive. The tunica arachnoides is proportionally much wider in youth than in the adult: similar to the brain, it then appears to be the seat of a more active nutrition: thus is it more liable to diseases. The increase of exhalation is more common in this than in any other serous bag: hence, hydro- cephalus. At birth, when the internal motions suddenly become excessively multiplied, on account of respiration, digestion and secretion, the serous surfaces I conceive become the seat of more active exhalation. Besides, as they are permeated with but very little blood, the sudden production of the red blood, and its approach through the arterial system where it succeeds to the dark blood, produces less changes in them than in the mucous surfaces and muscular system. The serous membranes grow in the same man- ® ner as all the other organs ; thin fora long time.SEKOUS SYSTEM. 622 and perfectly transparent, they become gradually thicker with age, and assume a tarnished white appearance: their suppleness decreases gradually as their increase of density, and resist the different re-agents the less, as the subject is younger. In infants, they are much sooner reduced to an homogeneous pulp. I have observed that in the foetus undergoing putrescency, different gases frequently collect in the serous cavities, as may be ascertained by opening these cavities under water; a pheno- menon much less striking in the adult, in which subject the cellular tissue is frequently emphyse- matous from putrescency, without any thing escaping through the canula introduced into the peritoneal cavity, or in that of the pleura, as I have frequently ascertained myself. Gases much more frequently arise from the organs of the foetus, in experiments on maceration, than from those of an adult. SECTION II. State of the Serous System in the Subsequent Ages. In the adult the serous system is long station- nary as it were, before undergoing any evident change; its membranes merely follow the same laws that govern the organs by which they areSEROUS SYSTEM. 623 enveloped. Thus in the stage subsequent to youth, the serous surfaces of the chest are frequently the seat of inflammations, dropsies, <&c.; whilst in the age bordering upon decrepitude, affections of the peritoneum are most common. In old age, the serous system grows dense and tight, and its adhesions with the surrounding parts are more obvious: hence it will not so rea- dily admit of those motions we have mentioned; its reduced powers oppose more difficulty to ab- sorption, and it is frequently the seat of dropsy. When affected by diseases, these, from a similar cause, assume a remarkably chronic type. In the Hotel Dieu, there are several aged persons who have long suffered from tubercular inflammation of the peritoneum, whilst younger subjects soon fall a victim to similar affections. Thus, in aged subjects, cancers often remain inert as it were, and unattended with pain, whilst in adults they gene- rally run their course with great rapidity. Serous effusions are much less frequent in old age, than the infiltrations of the subcutaneous cellular tissue, but yet they are more frequent than those of the intermuscular tissue. The serous system ossifies ; but not like the arterial, the cartilaginous system, &c. as the effect of age. These membranes are not always found ossified in old subjects ; and when this phenome- non takes place it is not confined to any period of life. It is a disease, a real tumour, whilst in theHE ROUS SYSTEM. 624 arteries and in the cartilages, it appears to belong to the natural series of functions. I have a prepa- ration in which the tunica arachnoides is evi- dently ossified in several points; and as it is towards the dura mater that these productions are formed, they prove that the arachnoid mem- brane is distinct from it; for at these parts they are readily separated* Accidental Developement oj' the Serous System. I will not repeat here, what I have stated in speaking of the cellular tissue in respect to the formation of cysts* Perfectly similar to the serous membranes, these cysts should be really considered as an accidental deveiopement of these membranes; they have the same appearance, and almost the same texture; supply their fluid according to the same laws, seem to be the seat of continual absorption and exhalation, since it is in vain to empty them by puncture; the fluids are reproduced, so long as the cysts remain* For instance, compare the cyst which has formed accidentally along the spermatic cord to the tunica vaginalis filled with water in hydrocele. If the volume of these two tumours, which are often formed together, be the same, it is impossible to find any difference in the form, appearance, texture, properties, and functions, Arc*SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. I place this next to the serous system, because it has the strongest resemblance to it. 1st. In respect to its form, which in each of these organs is that of an imperforated sac. 2dly. In respect to its texture, which appears to be essentially cellular. 3dly. To its functions, which consist in alternate exhalation and absorption. What serves to establish a sensible line of . • demarcation between these two systems is: 1st. That the fluid which lubricates the membranes appears to differ in its composition, although it is very analogous to synovia. 2dly. That in cases of general dropsy, which affects simultaneously the cellular tissue, and all the serous surfaces of the peritoneum, the pleura, &c. the synovial mem- branes are not affected, which indicates a differ- ence of structure, although we are not acquainted with it. 3dly. On the other hand, in dropsies of the articulations, and in those of the synovial capsules of the tendons, there is no concomitant affection of the great cavities. 4thly. The fluid ef- fused into the joints does not resemble that which fills the great cavities similarly affected. Sthly. VOL. II. s sSYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 026 The synovial membranes are much less frequently the seat of chronic tubercular inflammation than the serous, in which they are very frequent. However, I have seen two examples of this affec- tion in the synovial membrane of the knee, and I believe also that these are the only systems in which it is observed ; so that its occurrence in both shows some analogy of character, whilst its being much less frequent in the one constitutes a distinction. 6thlv. The different kinds of adhe- sions which I have noticed with respect to the serous surfaces are not found in the synovial, wherein that only which identifies these two adherent surfaces is observed; a mode that fre- quently takes place in anchylosis, which is as frequently produced by this as by the stiffness of the parts surrounding the articulation. 7thly. The synovial surfaces are not so frequently as the serous the seat of these remarkable locomotions we have mentioned, which proceed from the articulating organs not being, like the major part of those invested by serous surfaces, liable to al- ternate dilatations and contractions. The synovial system evidently presents two grand divisions. To the one the articulating system belongs ; that of the tendinous grooves to the other. We will examine them separately.027 SYNOVI A I, SYSTEM. ARTICLE I. Synovial System of the Joints. 1 am, I believe, the first that has attempted to describe this important function ol the synovial system, and I shall now repeat what I have said elsewhere. I shall first enquire how the synovia is separated, then examine this fluid, and finally, describe the organ from which it proceeds. SECTION i. How the Synovia is separated from the Mass of the Blood. Every fluid distinct from the blood can only be separated from it, to be subsequently trans- mitted to any organ, by one of the three fol- lowing modes:—1st. By secretion, a function characterised by a gland being interposed between the blood vessels that supply the matter and the excretory ducts through which the fluid is ex- pelled. 2dly. By exhalation, a function distinct from the former, by the absence of* that interme- diate gland, and by the immediate continuity of the blood vessel with the exhalent tube. 3dly. B transudation, a phenomenon purely physical, generally occurring in dead bodies, seldom ob- served during life; the mere transmission of a 88 2SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. G28 fluid through the pores of an organ, towards which that fluid is mechanically directed. Let us examine which of these three modes nature has selected to deposit synovia over the articu- lating surfaces. Is the Synovia transmitted by Secretion to the Articulating Surfaces ? We are indebted to Clopton Havers for the J system by which the sources of synovia are ascribed to the glands. Several authors prior to him had described them confusedly in the articu- lation ; but he made them the special object of his researches, described them in the different articulations, separated them into two classes, the One principal, the other accessory, and assigned to these organs such evident characters, that, ac- cording to him, it was impossible to disown them. Reddish spongy spherical bodies, formed out of the folds of membranes, sometimes situate within the articulations, at other times externally, but invariably disposed in such a manner as to be protected from too strong compression, and pouring through tubes, disposed in the form of a fringe, the fluid they separate. Such are the cha- racters traced by Havers, characters every anato- mist has borrowed from him, and the reality of which the most modern and celebrated authors have sanctioned in their works.629 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 4 In this last century, however, several anatomists have cast some doubts upon the reality of these glandular bodies. Lieutand has confounded them with the greasy cellular tissue, and Desault does not distinguish them from it. Every thing has confirmed me in the same opinion, which seems indisputably supported by a number of considera- tions. 1st. These bodies of a reddish appearance are only seen in particular articulations: there are many in which their existence is admitted by supposition only. 2dly. It is certain that none are observed in the greatest part of the synovial membranes of the tendons, although Havers, Al- binus, Juncke, and Fourcroy, have placed them in all, grounding their opinions, no doubt, upon analogy, but not upon inspection. In these two cases, however, synovia is equally separated, and lubricates the surfaces of the articulations and tendinous sheaths. This separation then is inde- pendent of glandular action. 3dly. If the syno- vial glands, (the best characterized) such as those of the cotyloid cavity, be examined, no traces whatever can be discovered of that parenchyma, unknown in its nature, but very remarkable by its structure, which in general composes the glands, and which distinguishes them from other parts, constituting their organic character. 4thly. No excretory duct can possibly be demonstrated in these organs. Those under the form of a fringe, admitted by Havers, are imaginary. Bertin him-630 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM, self, although he ascribed to these bodies a glan~ dular structure, has acknowledged this truth. The existence of these ducts is not better ascer- tained by the transudation of fluids injected through the arteries surrounding the articulation, than the same experiment could establish this fact in the cavities of the serous membranes, where this transudation also takes place, and wherein it is sufficiently proved there are no glands, othly. These greasy forms are completely resolved into cellular tissue by inflation, and the same effect is produced by maceration When ebulli- tion, gradually produced and long continued, has completely stript these bodies of fat, there is nothing left but a mass of collapsed cellulae, similar to those of the common cellular tissue. Gthly, In certain affections the glandular form is proclaimed by a particular induration and tume- faction, of which other organs, as the muscles, tendons, &c. never afford examples. The liver, the kidneys, the salivary organs, all evident glands in short, are remarkable in this respect. Such even is the power of this character, that it helps to point out the existence of glands previously imperceptible in their natural state. For instance, the existence of the cryptae of the stomach, ure- thra, and of several other mucous membranes, is grounded, first, upon analogy ; but more particu- larly on the accidental developement of these bodies in particular diseases. On the contrary,631 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. these pretended synovial glands never present a similar developement. In the diseases of articu-> lations, an obstruction, common to all, seems to identify them with the surrounding cellular tissue. As other glands they are not liable to affection distinct from those of this tissue, because they do not enjoy a vitality proper to themselves, and because being merely prolongations only of the adjacent cellular tissue, they partake of its nature and properties, and of course of its various changes. The considerations I have just presented to the reader in a successive order, form, I think, a suffi- cient mass of evidence to resolve the preceding problem, by showing that synovia is not trans- mitted by secretion to the articulating surfaces. Let us proceed to the second mode of trans- mission pointed out by authors. Is Synovia transmitted by Transudation to the Articulating Surfaces ? It was once a generally received opinion that the marrow of the long bones transuded through the pores of their extremities, and through those of the cartilages they are terminated by, to lubri- cate the articulating surfaces. Havers revived that idea, forgotten at the time he wrote : he asso- ciated this source of synovia to that he had placed m the glands, and thus formed of this humour aSYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 632 mixture composed of two different fluids, conveyed to the articulations. The greater part of those who followed him adopted his opinion on this head. Even those who, like Desault, denied the existence of articulating glands, and there- fore that synovia is secreted, admitted of its transudation, grounding themselves on the follow- ing observations. 1st. A long bone, stript of its marrow parts, and exposed to the air, suffers a greasy transudation to escape through the pores of its cartilages, and ceasing only when the medullary juice is completely exhausted. 2dly. The mechanical compression of the cartilaginous extremity of a long bone will, for the time, pro- duce a similar phenomenon. Are these facts, so evident in a dead bone, as evident in a living one ? Divers considerations I am about to lay down, induce me to believe the reverse. 1st. The vital powers, the effect of which is to impart to every organ, animated by them, a de- gree of tone sufficient to oppose the approach of fluids, leave, on being annihilated, the fibres of these very organs in a state of laxity, admitting everywhere of being permeated. Thus transuda- tion at present is considered peculiar to the dead body, a process which cannot be considered vital without admitting of an evident deviation from the laws of nature, characterized by simplicity and uniformity. In the experiment previously related, the greasy transudation is effected notSYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 633 only through the pores of the cartilages, but also through those of the whole surface of the bone; so that, reasoning from what is observed in the corpse, it is evident that during life the whole bone should be, as it were, immersed in an atmo- sphere of synovia ; a circumstance which, being fully contradicted by the slightest inspection, proves how very erroneous was the principle from which it was derived. 3dly. The articula- tions of the cartilages of the larynx are lubricated, like those of bones, by the synovial fluid; and here any transudation whatever of marrow is evidently impossible, since there is no marrow in the substance of gristles. 4thly. In diseases that affect the articulations, and alter the fluids with which they are moistened, the marrow gene- rally continues healthy, nor is it changed in the diseases affecting the interior cavities of bones, whose influence especially bears upon the medul- lary organ. 5thly. To conclude : the experiment I have made, and which has been related in the chapter on marrow, most evidently proves there is no such thing as a transudation of this fluid. In order to explain the manner in which sy- novia was separated from the blood, Desault added to that pretended transudation of marrow another transudation, flowing from every part within the articulation, as from the capsular and inarticular ligaments, the adipose matter, cartilage, &c. A single simile will be sufficient to appre-SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 634 ciate such an hypothesis. What would be said of a theory in which, to explain the production of the serous fluid in the abdomen, the source from which it flows were placed in the liver, spleen, intestines, and in general in all the organs of that cavity ? Undoubtedly the answer must be, that a fluid of a similar nature could not possibly flow from parts so different in structure ; that it is much more natural to look for the only source in the membrane by which all the gastric viscera are enveloped. The application is correct, and the analogy complete in respect to the articula- ting cavities. We may then, I believe, without fear of error, conclude from all this, that the synovia does not transude into the articulating surfaces. Let us proceed to the last mode, indicated for the separation of synovia. Is the Synovia transmitted by Exhalation to the Articulating Surfaces ? The solution of the two preceding problems naturally lead to the question now proposed. In fact the following are opinions, the correctness of which I believe may be admitted : 1st. Secre- tion, exhalation, and transudation, are the only means by which a fluid differing from the blood can be conveyed to an organ. Sndly. The syno- via is not produced by secretion, nor does itSYNOVIAL SYSTEM* 635 transude; now from these two certain positions, should not this consequence be deduced : that ex- halation is the mode by which the synovia is con- veyed to the articulations. But to these negative proofs let us add considerations by which this proposition is fully established. The most striking resemblance between the synovia and the fluid which lubricates the par- ticles of the serous membranes are observed: 1st. Similarity of composition, for both these fluids are essentially albuminous. Albumine pre- dominates in both, though it is somewhat differ- ent, as Marguerron has demonstrated. Havers had already pointed to this analogy ; he was con- scious these two fluids were coagulable by alco- hol, acids, and caloric, though unacquainted with the principle from which this property was de- rived. 2ndly. Similitude in functions. Both are intended to lubricate surfaces performing fre- quent motions, to counteract friction, their un- avoidable effect, and prevent fatal adhesions. Both are in a similar state on their respective surfaces: they moisten their respective surfaces and are soon absorbed. 3rdly. Similarity of affections. Inflammation drains the sources of both, and more frequently produces adhesions than in the mucous membranes. Both are liable to be preternaturally increased, as in dropsies. 4thly. Similarity of absorption. The lymphatic system is the medium by which, alter having remained aSYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 636 sufficient length of time on their respective sur- faces, both are returned to the tide of circulation. Does not this series of analogies, which, admit- ting of a few distinctions only in respect to com- position, so obviously associates synovia with the fluid of the serous membranes, naturally lead us to a very simple consequence, namely, that these two fluids, being analogous in every respect, must be so in their mode of separation from the blood ? Now as it is fully admitted that the humour of the serous membranes is conveyed by exhalation, we are evidently led, by a sequence of deductions, to this, which answers the preceding question: that synovia is actually exhaled from the articulating surfaces. This precise and strict consequence, deduced from invariable and palpable facts, will, I am in- clined to think, be fully admitted, when to the preceding analogies are added that of the mem- branous organs, the essential of the exhalation of synovia. SECTION II. Remarks upon Synovia. Thus separated from the mass of the blood, synovia presents itself under the form of a whitish fluid, viscid and transparent: on flowing from the articulation it is ropy. This unctuous natureSYNOVIAL SYSTEM. to me to contain the most. Next always appeared G37 makes it very fit to lubricate the articulating sur- face undergoing friction, and to weaken the shock of contact. It varies in quantity: there are articulations liberally supplied with it; that of the ancle has in order is the ileo-femoral, the scapulo-femoral, the humero-cubital, &c. There are others where- in hardly any is seen : such are the sterno-clavi- clar, the sterno-costal, the costo-vertebral, &c.; the invariable dryness observed in these articula- tions does not result from the small extent of the synovial membranes, for the synovial bags of the larynx, though much less capacious, are moister. The synovia besides, does not, like the serum of the serous membranes, vary in quantity in every articulation. Although little accustomed to dis- secting the peritoneum, pleura, pericardium, &c. we may observe that two are scarcely ever alike : sometimes it is a mere dew, at other times a real collection of fluid. Here, on the contrary, it is almost invariably the same quantity : this proceeds from the synovial not so readily admitting, as the serous surfaces do, of being sympathetically ex- cited by the diseases of the other organs. The synovia is not liable to the divers altera- tions observed in the serous fluids. I have never witnessed in the articulating surf aces what is called the false inflammatory membrane. The unnatu- ral collections of synovia never contain any of038 SYNOVfAL SYSTEM. those whitish flakes so commonly observed where serum is accumulated. I know of no instance of an effusion of milky serum in articulations. One of its most frequent alterations, is, I believe, when this fluid assumes the consistence of a reddish jelly, somewhat similar (if I may be allowed the simile)ito currant jelly. Now this alteration has positively nothing to do with the serous fluids. These essential distinctions observed in the al- terations of the synovia and serum, evidently imply a difference in the nature of their compo- nent principles in the natural state. The viscidity of the one, and the greater fluidity of the other, are additional proofs of this, as Fourcroy has ob- served. This diversity in nature appears espe- cially to depend upon a particular substance that enters into the composition of the synovia, and is met with in hardly any other animal fluid. Marguerron, who has studied it, speaks of it as a particular kind of albumine, highly deserving of further research. I shall not enter upon a detailed analysis of synovia, this lays within the department of ani- mal chemistry. section nr. Of the Synovial Membranes. We have seen that the folding of the serous membranes that line the large cavities form a kind of unperforated sacs, embracing both theSYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 639 organs and parietes of these cavities. In every moveable articulation there are membranes perfectly similar, intended for the very same uses, not differing in their nature, and which I have called synovial because they incessantly exhale and absorb synovia. Forms. Every synovial membrane then should be con- sidered as an imperforated sac, formed over the organs of articulation, over the inter-articular cartilages, the internal surface of the lateral and capsular ligaments, the whole of the inter-articu- lar ligaments wherever they exist, and over the greazy bundles rather pre-eminent in some of the articular cavities, &c. It is from them these divers organs borrow that smooth, polished and shining appearance they are characterized by in these cavities, and which the}? do not possess in other parts. As by nicely dissecting the gastric organs, the peritoneum might be removed, and left per- fectly entire; so may we conceive the possibility of separating even this membrane, were it not for the intimate adhesions it contracts in different parts. All the parts it invests are without the articulating cavity, although projecting into that cavity, as the lungs are placed external to the sac iormed by the pleura, the liver external to that of the peritoneum, &c. &c.fi40 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM* The synovial membrane is found in all the moveable articulations, the greater part of which possess nothing' more than this membrane and lateral ligaments. ^What are generally termed fibrous capsules, are^seen around some articu- lating surfaces. The connexions of the humerus, femur, and of two or three other bones, are the only instances. In these articulations, two very distinct envelopements are obvious : the one, ex- ternal and fibrous, is disposed in the form of a bag, open above and below, embracing by both its large openings the surfaces of the two bones, and identifying itself in those parts with the perios- teum, by intermixing its fibres with those of that organ. The other cellular, which is the synovial membrane, lines the former within, and forsakes it on approaching the two inter-articular cartilages, and is reflected over them instead of uniting with the periosteum. Boyer has described this dispo- sition in respect to the femur. In all the hinge, like articulations, as in those of the elbow, knee, the phalanges of the hands and feet, &c. &c., the fibrous capsules are wholly deficient. The fibres, instead of spreading and in- terweaving into a membrane,contract into fasciculi of greater or less thickness, forming the lateral ligaments. Nothing more can be found than the internal sheet of the enarthrodial articulations, that is to say, the synovial membrane, which also does not here contract the slightest adhesion withSYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 641 the periosteum, but is reflected over the cartilages. Bv taking it where it reflects, it may be removed to some extent, and thus we may be convinced that it presents an external organization very different from that which the first idea of an arti- culating capsule presents to the mind. This disposition is easily perceived on the slightest dissection in the knee, under the crural tendon andtheinferiorligamentof the patella; inthe elbow under the tendon of the triceps, in the phalanges under those of the extensor, &c. In every articu- lation the organization is also similar, as may be seen in descriptive anatomy; so that it may be affirmed, that a small number only of articulations are possessed of fibrous capsules, that nearly all have nothing more than synovial bags which are formed and reflected over the bony surfaces, without being inserted round them, as all others have stated. I have established this remarkable difference by numberless dissections. Several anatomists were on the way to discovery when they observed,that various capsules appeared to be completely formed of cellular tissue. It was in fact the texture of the synovial membrane, essentially differing in this from the fibrous cap- sules. Let the term capsule be applied if they please to every articulation ; but different ideas must necessarily be attached to it. Let us only compare, for instance, the fibrous capsule of the femur, with the synovial capsule of the knee, and VOL. IT. T T042 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. we shall find, on the one hand, 1st. a cylindrical bag with two wide openings to receive the ex- tremities of the bones, and several small ones for the vessels; 2ndly. A flbous interlacement similar to that of tendons, aponeurosis, &c. ; 3rdly. A mode of sensibility analogous to that of these organs: 4thly. The use of retaining firmly in their respective places the articulated bones, which have no other bond of union. On the other hand, we shall observe; 1st. An imperforated sac ; 2ndly. A cellular structure, similar to that of the serous membranes ; 3rdly. A sensibility of a similar nature ; 4thly. The single function of containing and separating synovia, the bones being secured by strong ligaments. The different re-agents exercise over the fibrous capsules, an influence quite distinct from that which operates upon the synovial membranes. By ebullition they become yellow, semi-transparent, soften like the tendons, and are gradually diffused into gelatine. The synovial membranes that have been boiled are left white, and produce hut little of this substance. I have even observed, that the yellow hue, and the semi-transparency of boiled fibrous capsules, is an infallible means of ascertaining which are the articulations provided with these organs, or those deprived of them. The presence of the synovial membrane in the articulations when in an isolated state, is obvious at the slightest glance ; and in those where it isSYNOVIAL SYSTEM. (>43 united to a fibrous capsule, it is still very distinct in several parts. Thus in the femur, this membrane is dissected over the inter-articular ligament, over ihe great mass of the cotyloid cavity, over the neck of the bone ; in those parts where it sepa- rates the fibrous capsule to be reflected over the cartilages, &c.; but its adhesion with these carti- lages and internal surface of the capsule, might raise some doubts respecting the form of an imperforated sac, as we have termed it. It is indispensable then, to bring forward such con- siderations as may remove these doubts. 1st. However much the synovial membranes maybe attached, they may be separated without la- ceration, by slow dissection carefully managed, and begun where the membrane is reflected from the cartilage over the capsule. Maceration long con- tinued, allows also its being removed in shreds; 2ndly. Subsequent to certain inflammatory affections, this membrane assumes a thickness and opacity, by which it is distinguished from every adjacent organ, even from those to which it is the most firmly attached; 3rdly. The synovial sacs of tendons, are in every respect quite as adherent as the articulating synovial membranes are to the cartilages of their sheath, and to the very sheath itself; but still they are allowed to be distinct ; 4thly. There are articulations provided with fibrous capsules, in which the fibres separated from each other, leave between them spaces through which synovia would escape, were they not lined t t 2 iSYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 6 44 by the synovial membrane. When ever the arti- culation is inflated, this membrane is seen swelling through these interstices, and presenting a texture quite different from that of the capsule. Berlin made this observation; but bethought the projec- tions were isolated, for he did not observe they were merely a continuity of the membrane extended throughout the whole articulation; 5thly. When viewing the serous system, we have noticed, that the smooth and polished aspect observed on the sur- faces of the organs, as well as in the cavities, was invariably derived from these membranes and not a part of their structure : now we shall find, that the synovial membrane is in respect to texture almost similar to the serous. It appears then, that in those parts, where the articulations have this character, it is derived from this membrane, although it may not be quite so distinct over these organs, as where the membrane is left float- ing. This smooth and polished aspect besides, is never observed in articulations evidently unpro- vided with this membrane. Such are the sym- physis pubis, and that of the sacro-iliac symphysis, which although contiguous, are found uneven and rough, &c. We have also ascertained that this structure can never be owing to compres- sion. From these various considerations we may, I believe, be easily convinced, that although the synovial membrane adheres at several points, it Id be viewed in a maimer perfectly similar to645 SYNOVIA 1; SYSTEM. that of the serous membranes ; that is to say, as a complete imperforated bag, every where continu- ous and formed over the organs of the articulation. Besides, do not the fibro-serous membranes present similar adhesions, although the isolated existence of the two sheets they are composed of, is gene- rally avowed ? From the idea we have formed to ourselves of the synovial membranes, it may be readily con- ceived how particular organs may cross the articulation, without synovia flowing from the aperture through which they are received, or from that through which they pass out. The synovial membrane then reflected round these organs, pro- vides them with a sheath, by which they are separated from the fluid and from the articula- tion. Thus the tendon of the biceps is no more contained within the shoulder joint, than the umbilical vein, the urachus, &c. are within the peritoneal cavity. It is easily removed from the membraneous portion by which its sheath is formed. The preceding considerations also establish a perfect identity between the synovial capsules of tendons, and the articulating synovial membranes. In the preceding instance, these two kinds of membranes are evidently continuous; for the capsule of the bicepital insertion is of the same nature as that of the tendons, which have an isolated one, as the flexors for instance.646 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. Organization. We have just seen that the synovial membrane approaches very much to the class of serous mem- branes ; the same similitude is observed in respect to its internal organization. This organization is especially cellular, as is proved by drying, inflat- ing, and particularly by macerating them. The bag formed by ganglions is evidently nothing but a produce of the cellular organ : Now it is perfectly known, that this bag contains and ex- hales a fluid similar to synovia. Wherever the synovial membrane is free, it is attached outwardly to this organ, and so intimately connected with it, that by successively removing the different layers, they are seen gradually to condense, and finally to unite closely together. In these as in the serous membranes, no fibres are distinct: when perfectly insulated, they become transparent, which is easily effected in the knee, to a considerable extent. I shall not enter into a repetition of the various circumstances, by which the cellular structure of the serous system is established ; almost all of them are applicable to the synovial organ, which appears to be nothing more than an interlacement of exhalents and absorbents. Hence it is easily conceived what are these reddish and greasy bun- dles, disseminated around the articulations. They fulfil in respect to this membrane, the functions ol the abundant cellular tissue, in which the pcrito-647 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. neum, the pleura, Ac. tfcc., are imbedded. It is there the blood vessels divide ad infinitum, before they reach the membrane, where their ramusculee successively decreasing, finally terminate in the exhalents. If these bundles are sometimes dis- tinct from the cellular tissue by a remarkable redness, it is because the vessels are more concen- trated, and lay nearer to each other; for instance, in the articulation of the hip, where the synovial membrane corresponds with cellular tissue in the notch of the cotyloidal cavity only, nature has concentrated nearly every arterial ramification, by which it is supplied with synovia: hence the red hue of the cellular mass of that part. In the knee, on the contrary, where the external surface of the synovial bag is liberally supplied with cel- lular tissue, the numerous vessels impart to this tissue the same hue as that of the external surface of the serous membranes, &c. This redness of a few pretended synovial glands, the only character attributed to them, is only accidental then, and no more proves their glandular nature, than in the pia-mater, where it proceeds from the same cause. Although perfectly analogous with the serous surfaces, the synovial membranes must, however, present some difference in tissue, since the fluid they exhale is rather different. In fact, in examin- • • • mg it mthe femorO'tibial articulation, where con- siderable threads may be obtained, it is found denser and tighter than the serous membranes*648 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. Its tissue is not so supple as that of the latter; when dried it is much more brittle; it remains stiff, whilst the serous tissue is moved in every direction on the slightest attempt. It also resists maceration much longer, &c. Properties, The properties of the tissue are displayed in dropsies of the articulations, where the synovial membranes are first much distended, and contract again after they are punctured, an operation^ however, which is rarely performed. It appears, however, that these membranes only admit of a slow and gradual distention : we are aware that when they are abruptly distended in luxations, their parieties lacerate instead of yielding: they reunite again subsequent to reduction. Amongst the vital properties, organic sensibility only is allotted to this system in the natural state, as I have ascertained by my numerous experi- ments on living animals, in which these surfaces laid bare, were excited by several irritating agents. But the increase of vitality that causes inflamma- tion, by increasing this sensibility, so as to produce pain, is observed ; 1st. In wounds, when these membranes are exposed to the contact of air; 2ndly. During the continued irritation they expe- rience from foreign bodies being accidentally formed in the articulation ; 3rdly. In the various affections of the articulating surfaces, &c. .9 uSYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 619 This mode of sensibility of the synovial mem- branes, helps to confirm what I have said before: namely, that the major part of the articulations, those forming a hinge in particular, are not pos- sessed of fibrous capsules. In fact, I have already proved, that these capsules, as well as the lateral ligaments, are endowed with a mode of animal sensibility, very conspicuous when they are drawn out; so that, if an articulation be stript of every surrounding organ, excepting the synovial and lateral ligaments, and it is then twisted, violent pain is produced ; but if these ligaments be subse- quently divided, and the synovial membrane only left, the joint may be twisted without producing pain. This experiment easily repeated in the anterior and posterior limbs, may serve to point out those articulations in which a synovial mem- brane exists exclusively, and those wherein this organ is joined to a fibrous capsule. This being of a similar texture as the lateral ligaments, pro- duces the same pains when drawn, as is proved besides, by experiments tried on articulations possessed of such capsules. Insensible contractility, is obvious in the exhala- tions and absorptions alternately performed by the synovial membranes. I have already remarked, that the synovial mem- branes act but a very indifferent part in sympa- thies, and rarely partake of the affections of other organs. Whilst in the acute diseases of an impor-SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 650 tant viscus, the skin, tiie mucous surfaces, the cellular tissue, the nerves, &c. &c., are more or less sympathetically agitated, the synovial mem- branes remain unmoved; they are not then found to be the seat of undefined pains, nor is their ex- halation more active or retarded. In this respect they are somewhat similar to the bony, the carti- laginous, and even to the fibrous systems, &e. Thus physicians should not look to the synovial system for those symptoms, which are indepen- dent of the injury the diseased organ itself has sustained, but to its connections with the other parts. In such pains as affect the articulations, there are undoubtedly cases in which the synovial mem- brane is diseased, and others wherein the fibrous organs are exclusively the seat of the disorder. The distinction of these cases is left for further research. Functions. The synovial membrane seems wholly uncon- nected with the solidity of the articulation. The fibrous capsules, and the lateral ligaments are exclusively intrusted with the care of securing it. The smooth surface, which the articular extremi- ties borrow from this membrane, facilitates their motions ; it may even facilitate muscular action. Thus the synovial portions situate behind the knee, in the elbow under the triceps, in the phalanges,SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 051 under the flexors, <&c., fulfil in regard to these muscles, the same functions as the tendinous syno- vial bags. They are to their respective tendons, what the cellular bag is to those of the psoas, and of the iliac, on separating them from the crural arch. The most important use of the membrane we are now considering relates to synovia. It is ex- haled from this membrane through a multiplicity of orifices, which, after remaining a short time on these surfaces, is returned by absorption into the circulation. Its parieties are then the seat of exhalation, as the kidnies, for instance, are the focus of secretion of urine. The reservoir for the exhaled fluid-is the imperforated sac it forms, as the bladder is for urine that flows from the or- gans that secrete it. The excretory tubes of this fluid are the absorbents that return it to the mass of the blood, as the urethra outwardly rejects urine from the bladder. In these respects there is much more analogy between secretion and exhalation than would at first be supposed. The effects arising from the continuation of the synovia in its membranous reservoir relate to itself, or to the articular surfaces. The first con- sist in a particular alteration it undergoes before it is absorbed, and of which we are ignorant. The second facilitate the motions of the joints. The unctuous and slippery fluid which these surfaces652 SYNOVIA E SYSTEM. borrow from the synovia, is, as I have stated, remarkably adapted to this use. Natural Developement. In the foetus, and in the infant, the major part of the synovial membranes are proportionally much wider than in the subsequent ages; because the articulating surfaces are more extensive in the cartilaginous than in the osseous state; but then they are remarkable for their excessvie tenuity .jThe synovia is not, as the serous fluids are at that stage of life, more unctuous and firmer ; it even seems to be less so. It is not very abundant previous to birth, undoubtedly because the motions are much restrained. I have observed, that as age advances this membrane grows tighter and denser: it partly loses its whitish appearance, turns grayish, and less synovia is exhaled from it This membrane is not like the serous surfaces, liable to dropsies : the degree of rigidity it acquires contributes to render motion painful. It never ossifies unless by accident. The phosphate of lime, which by degrees invades the cartilages, never incrusts this membrane. There is no instance, I believe, of a bone being left bare in an aged subject.SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 053 Accidental Dev elopement, I have already sfated in the chapter on the fibrous capsules, that whenever the head of a bone has been left displaced, the membrane that formed round this head is not similar to the ori- ginal one; it is a real cyst, smooth in its internal surface, moistened with serum, formed at the ex- pence of the cellular tissue, and presenting com- pletely, though leather thicker, the appearance of the synovial membrane. The motions imparted to a dislocated limb appear to increase the serous exhalation in this newly-formed membrane : hence, undoubtedly, the great advantage resulting from these motions, to assist in the reduction. I have observed in a dancer, that the head of the humerus, which had fixed itself in the armpit, still performed a variety of motions, ARTICLE II. Synovial System of the Tendons. This system, noticed by several authors, de- scribed by Fourcroy, Soemmering, and others, is absolutely of the same nature as the preceding, dif- fering only in situation. Thus is the synovial mem- brane of the tendon of the biceps continuous with that of the scapulo-humeral articulation : thus are those of the jemeili, with the synovial organ ofSYNOVIA fj SYSTEM. 65 4 the fernoro-tibiai articulation ; it is the very same membrane belonging at the same time both to the tendon and to the articulation. Another re- markable instance is observed in respect to the extensors of the leg, and the popliteus, for the tendons of which the synovial membrane of the knee serves as a capsule, &c. Very few synovial grooves are observed in the trunk ; almost all of them are placed in the limbs, where they are intended for the gliding of ten- dons. They are seen, 1st. There where a tendon is reflected by an angle over a bone, as round those of the peroneus longus, the peroneus medius of the internal obturator, of the great oblique of the eye, &c,; 2dlv. Wherever a tendon glides over a bony surface without being reflected, as at the extremity of the tendo-achilles, as under that of the gluteus magnus of the united tendons of the iliacus internus, and psoas muscles, &c.; where a tendon glides in a fibrous capsule, as in those of every flexor, &c. their extent is in- variably proportioned to that of the tendons over which they are formed. Forms— Connections—Synovial Fluid. The synovial tendons are like those of the arti- cular, imperforated sacs, folded on one part over the tendon, and on the other over the adja- cent organs. These sacs are differently shaped,SYNOVIA1, SYSTEM. 655 according' to the disposition of the tendon, but their general disposition is invariable. Hence we conceive that each tendinous synovial sheath has two faces, the one forming the interior of the sac, which is wholly detached, the other lining the adjacent organs. The free surface is incessantly moistened with a fluid perfectly similar to that of the articulations, formed like the latter by exhalations, and not from the adjacent reddish bodies, as authors had asserted ; bodies which most generally cannot be traced, and which, wherever they do exist, have nothing of a glandular nature. In general, this fluid is not quite so abundant as in articulations, in the corpse at least. But varieties are observed in the different synovial bags : those of the tendo- achilles, of the united tendons of the iliacus in- ternus and psoas muscles, &c. are always danjper than those of the tendons of the flexors, &c. r Does the peculiar crackling noise sometimes produced by the motions of the tendons proceed from the deficiency of synovia? I have merely observed, that this noise bears some analogy to that of the articulations of the fingers when thev are suddenly bent; a crackling, not derived, as might be thought, from the friction of the bony surfaces: once produced, in fact, it cannot be created again although friction be renewed. Be- sides, it is well known, this crackling proceeds from the mechanical distension of the plalanges,SYNOVIAL SYSTEM* 656 consequently, from the separation of their arti- cular surfaces, as well as from flexion. The pree- ternatural collection of the synovial fluid in the tendinous sheaths constitute a species of dropsy, which has been termed ganglion, a tumour never observed in the synovial membranes of the fin- gers, no doubt from a want of extensibility in the fibrous capsules. It must not be thought, how- 'y VyL/yW # ever, that we rid ourselves of all these tumours on bursting them by a strong compression, and by thus forcing their fluid in the cellular tissue, contain true synovia, most generally they are accidental; they are as many cysts formed in the cellular tissue. In fact, these tumours are fre- quently observed over the tract of the great ex- tensor of the thumb, where there is no synovial membrane. Subsequent to rheumatic pains, I have witnessed a considerable collection of fluid in tile small synovial membrane of the tendo- achilles ; it disappeared by degrees. I have wit- nessed another similar to it in the bag of the psoas muscle of a corpse ; the fluid had a reddish appearance, and was as consistent as current jelly. By the action of nitric acid, it was instantly co- agulated into a whitish mass, similar to the white of a hard-boiled egg. The adherent surface of the synovial sheaths form, 1st. On one part, over the tendons, with which they are more or less intimately united They admit of being easily removed from over657 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM, those of the internal obturator, of the psoas, &c., and are completely confounded with those of the flexors; 2dly. On the other hand, it generally lines the periosteum, which in this part is in- crusted with gelatine, and forms a fibro-cartilage. Its mode of connection is similar to that of the articular synovial membrane with the carti- lage of the bone. Sometimes it is reflected over a fibrous capsule, after having lined the tendon : such are, those near to the scapulo-humeral arti- culation. In some instances, after having lined the tendon, they ascend as far as over the fleshy fibres; 'in the internal obturator for instance ; odly. On being reflected from the tendon over the ad- jacent organs, they generally answer to a quan- tity of cellular tissue; but in the sheaths of the flexors they line the fibrous sheaths. In every considerable motion the synovial mem- branes of the tendons are mere or less drawn out, but always less so than those of the serous surfaces. * The great variety of forms which the imperfo- rated sacs of the synovial sheaths present, may be formed into two great divisions; 1st. Some pre- sent round bags, a kind of vesicles: such are those of the supra-spinous, of the psoas and iliac, of the internal obturator, &c. All these membranes are remarkable, inasmuch as they never wholly in- vest the tendon but on one side only; inasmuch as they never form internal folds, or as they are never contained in fibrous sheaths; 2dly VOL. II. u u658 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM, The others, which especially belong to the flexors, and to the tendons crossing the sole of the foot, form at first a kind of cylindrical bag, which lines the canal, half fibrous and half cartilaginous, in which the tendon glides ; they are tthen reflected round it, and completely invest it, forming a sheath, which prevents its being immersed *in sy- novia. This kind of tendinous sheath then actually presents two canals, at the superior and inferior extremities of which are two bags, that unite them together, and thus complete the im- perforated bag. Internal folds, projecting from one canal to the other, are here frequently met with. One is also observed under the tendon of every synovial membrane of the flexors. % Organization—Properties. The organization of the synovial sheaths of the tendons is perfectly analogous to those of the ar- ticulations. Essentially cellular, the tissue of these membranes has no evident fibre; its softness is striking; they are provided with a small number only of blood-vessels; notwithstanding the con- trary opinion, the absorbents and exhalents are particularly predominant. These filled with blood in inflammation impress upon the membrane a reddish colour, more or less deep. Synovia is not exhaled in that state ; adhesions are even some- times found, as I have observed, in a subject in659 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. which the fibrous sheaths and their tendons seemed to form but one in the fore and middle fingers. The inflammatory phenomena of the synovial sheaths are particularly remarkable in whitlows, one species of which disease is evidently seated in those of the fingers, and is analogous to the in- flammation of the pleura, of the peritoneum, and to that of the articulations. It is more dangerous than that of the synovial membranes, forming bags or purses, because the fibrous membrane that surrounds the inflamed one is not calculated to yield, and thus to accommodate the swelling, as the cellular tissue enveloping these synovial vesicles will form contractions, frequently necessitating the use of the knife. Ido not know if the synovial tissue of the tendons is liable to these slow and tubercular in- flammations, which the serous and articular syno- vial systems share in common. Its vital properties, and those of the tissue, appear to be perfectly the same as those of the latter. The same as this, it sel- dom admits of being sympathetically influenced by the other organs; it remains unmoved amidst the confusion of other systems in acute diseases; it continues healthy amidst their alterations aris- ing from chronic affections. I have also observed that every one of its affections are almost local ones; for instance, never, as in the serous system, is there a dropsical diathesis observed ; that is to say, a case in which all the synovial bags fill at the same time. u u 2660 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. Fine and delicate, in the foetus and in the in- fant, the synovial membranes of the tendons ac- cord with the varied and incessant motion at the latter period. Tighter and denser in the adult, they grow rigid in old age, exhale less fluid, dry, and contribute no little by the state they are in to the slowness of the motions brought on by old age. Some of the synovial membranes are not always found: such, for instance, is that of the gluteus major, in lieu of which, nothing more than a cel- lular mass is frequently substituted. These kind of membranes, when existing, are in general very dry: their synovia is hardly discernible. In this respect they resemble similar membranes of the vertebra, of the clavicles, &c.GLANDULAR SYSTEM. This system, one of the most important in the animal economy, differs from the major part of others, inasmuch as its proper tissue is not exactly the same in all the organs it is composed of. The fibres of any one muscle of animal life would be equally well calculated for any other muscle of the same system. The tendinous fibre, the bone, the cartilaginous tissues, &c. also are every where alike. The tissue of the liver, on the contrary; could never contribute to form the kidney ; that of the latter would be foreign to the salivary organs. The glandular system then is analogous in all its parts in respect to general properties only, which admit of numerous exceptions. Authors have designated under the name of glands—organs, to which this appellation is in- applicable : such are the thyroid, the pineal? the lymphatic glands; those particularly about the bronchia, the thymus, the supra renal, &c. We should only call a gland, a body whichGLANDULAR SYSTEM, 662 emits, through various ducts, a fluid it separates from the blood received from the vessels resort- ing to it: 1st. In the head, the salivary, the la- chrymal, the meibomian glands, the tonsils, and the ceruminous glands of the ear; 2dly. The mammae upon the chest; 3dly. In the abdomen, the liver, the pancreas, and kidneys ; 4thly. In the pelvis, the prostate gland and the testis ; 5thly. In the trunk, in the face, and in the assemblage of the very nu- merous mucous glands. Such are nearly the or- gans composing this system ; all the other organs belonging to it by name, are, in respect to their texture, properties, vitality, and functions, per- fect strangers to it: in this point of view, Vic d’Azyr’s division is incorrect. The limbs contain nothing belonging to this system, undoubtedly, because the fluids it separates are nearly all intended for the organic functions, whilst in the limbs, every thing relates to those of animal life. ARTICLE I. Situations, For?ns, Division, <fc. of the Glandular System. The glands assume two different positions: some, as the breasts and the parotid, are subcuta- neous ; the others deeply situated, as the liver, the kidneys, the pancreas, and almost all the mucous glands, lay very distant from exterior forms, andGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 663 are thus secured from mechanical injury. The greater part occupy such parts as habitually per- form repeated motion ; such are, the salivary, near the jaws; the mucous, adjacent to the fleshy layer, the liver, near the diaphragm, <&c. This is what led to a belief that this motion was intended to assist the excretion of their fluids. But, 1st. The glands of the velum palati, the pancreas, the testis, the kidneys, could hardly, even on account of their respective situations, borrow the least auxiliary assistance ; 2ndly. We know the mouth waters, according to the vulgar expression, at the sight of a savoury dish ; 3rdly. The sialago- gues produce a similar effect; 4thly. When the bladder is paralyzed, the mucous juices flow as before, frequently even more abundantly ; 5thly. Semen is emitted involuntarily ; 6thly. The ex- cretion of the mucous juices is as easily effected in the pituitary membrane, as any where else, although the fleshy layer, nearly every where ex- tended under the mucous system, is absolutely wanting here, &c. &c. A multiplicity of similar facts prove this truth, elucidated by Bordeu, namely, that vital action is the essential cause of every excretion. Auxiliary means, however, ought not to be entirely rejected. In fact, in cases of salivary fistula, the patient evidently emits more fluid dur- ing mastication than at any other time. It is evident that the abdominal muscles act the mostGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 664 effectual part in the excretion of urine. To empty the gall-bladder, the surrounding motions, I believe, can hardly be dispensed with. In general, when- ever fluids are collected in considerable quantity, the parietes of the organs are not very powerful, as those of the heart; for instance, the motions of the adjacent organs are indispensable to remove the obstacle opposed. In the capillary vessels, on the contrary, wherein fluids are disseminated, the re-action of the containing organ is sufficient for the motion. The glands are in some instances single, as the liver, the pancreas, &c. ; at other times they are in pairs, as the kidneys, the salivary, the lachrymal glands, &c. These, in general, resemble each other ; but this similitude is never to be compared to that of the double organs of animal life. One of the kidneys is lower than the other; there is no analogy, either in length or in volume, between their veins and nerves ; different clefts frequently observed in one are not to be found in the other, &c. This observation applies also to the salivary glands. The forms of the glands are not in general fixed and invariable; in their individual direc- tions, size, and proportions, a multiplicity of va- rieties are observed ; they are never moulded on that strict and rigorous plan, invariably followed by the organs of animal life. This fact is evident, even to those who have scarcely paid any attentionGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 605 to anatomy. The following means place this fact in the strongest light. It is sufficiently known that the organs vary astonishingly in different in- dividuals : now, in these varieties, the proportions in animal life are ever the same, whilst in organic life they are rarely exact. Let us, for example, take an organ in each of these. I have constantly observed, that in a small brain the corpora callosa, the thalami nervorum, opticorum, <&c. are in pro- portion to the entire volume of the organ. Nothing, on the contrary, is more common than to find the lobulus spigelii united to a small liver, and, reciprocally, a large liver to a small lobe. This remarkable observation must have struck every anatomist. Sometimes a kidney is larger at its upper than at its lower part, or the contrary. In animal life, these varieties of volume relate to the entire organ ; in organic life, frequently to isolated parts. The reason appears to me to be, that harmony of action is indispensable for the animal functions : so that if one side of the brain were more fully developed than the other ; if one eye, one ear, one pituitary membrane, &c. were more characterized than its corresponding organ, understanding, sight, hearing, smell, &c. would necessarily be impaired, whilst the secretions of bile , urine, &c. may be perfectly effected, although one part be larger or smaller than the others. With respect to the glands, there is one circum- stance worthy of notice, which is, that those pro-666 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. vided with a membrane, as the liver, the kidneys, or even the pancreas, are less exposed to these irregularities than such as are unprovided with this, and imbedded in cellular tissue, as the sali- vary, the lachrymal, the mucous glands, <&c. I have frequently examined the latter in the mouth, and along the trachea, and never found them alike in two subjects. We are well aware that some- times the parotid gland extends over the masseter, that at other times it leaves it bare, that it is more or less continued over the neck, and is in that part of greater or less width, &c. Whenever one of the glands is wanting, or when one of them is diseased, the other is some- times considerably increased, as I have observed in the kidneys* This also happens in the treatment of fistula lachrymalis, by compression, a mode of treatment which is not always attended with success. In other instances the healthy gland is seen to increase its action, and separate more fluid, without becoming larger. The exterior of glands that are not provided with membranes are uneven and granulated; they correspond to muscles, vessels, nerves, and even to bones, such as the parotids that lay over the maxillary branches; in general they are sur- rounded with less cellular tissue than those in- tended to perform extensive motions; that which is directly in contact with them, is also tighter and denser than what is contained in the organic667 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. interstices; it strongly resembles the sub-mucous tissue, that exterior to arteries, veins, and to the excretory organs, &c. but it does not possess the same degree of resistance. It is rarely permeated with fat, and forms a kind of membrane, which, insulating in some degree the vitality of the gland, answers in a great part to the functions of the peritoneum round the liver, of the membrane proper to the kidneys, spleen, &c. ARTICLE II. Organization of the Glandular System. SECTION i. Tissue proper to the Organization of that System. The glandular tissue is distinct from the greater part of the others, inasmuch as it has nothing of a fibrous structure. The elements it is composed of are not placed next to each other, following longi- tudinal or oblique directions; as in the muscles, fibrous bodies, the bones, nerves, &c. they are conglomerated, united by cellular tissue, and very slightly adherent. Thus whilst organs, with very distinct fibres, present considerable resistance, especially in the direction of their fibres, these will lacerate at the slightest attempt, and even part with the utmost facility. The edges of the division are uneven and thready, a difference byGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 6G8 which they are distinguished from the cartilage, wherein the fracture is even. All the glands can- not be divided with equal facility. The prostate, the tonsils, the mucous glands, are much more re- sistant than the liver and kidneys, wherein this phenomenon is essentially produced. The pan- creatic and the salivary glands yield slightly ; but this does not proceed from their tissue, but from the abundant cellular tissue they contain. Their different lobes are then placed at greater distances, in proportion as the intermediate filaments be- come longer. The glandular tissue, very commonly called parenchyma, is in general disposed in three diffe- rent ways; 1st- In the pancreas, the salivary and la- chrymal glands, the lobes are separated by a quan- tity of cellular tissue, resulting from smaller lobes, and which are conglomerated; and these are formed from still smaller lobes, termed glandular grains. The first, second, third, and even fourth divisions, are easily followed by the knife ; 2dly. In the liver and kidneys, no signs whatever of the first, and even second divisions, can ever be traced ; no principal nor secondary lobe can be observed. All the glandular grains are in juxta- position, separated by an equal quantity of cellu- lar tissue, very small in quantity, as we shall find, present an uniform and even tissue, easily sepa- rated, as I have said, and granulated in its frac- tures ; 3dly. The prostate, the tonsils, all theGLANDULAR SYSTEM. G69 mucous glands, present a soft parenchyma, pul- pous, as it were, without the slightest appearance of lobes or grains of any description whatever. The slightest glance at the glandular system is sufficient to convince of the threefold and im- portant distinction I have pointed out. The testes and the mammae have a peculiar texture that has no reference to these distinctions. Authors have been actively engaged concern- ing the intimate structure of glands. Malpighy admitted in them, of small bodies, of a peculiar nature as he thought. Ruysch stated that they were all vascular. Let us throw aside all these idle questions, unsupported by inspection or ex- periment. Let us study anatomy, where it comes within the reach of our senses. The strict study of sciences will not in the pressure of age accord with a heap of hypotheses which in the last cen^ tury made general anatomy and physiology a frivolous novel. There is not the slightest doubt that the ex- cretory organs communicate with the arteries that penetrate the glands. Fluids injected into the latter readily escape through the former, without leaving in the gland the slightest mark of extravasation. Pure blood is frequently seen to flow from the excretory ducts, and to form sometimes bloody urine, at other times a bloody saliva, &c. But do these facts prove there is nothing more than vessels in glands; that theGLANDULAIl SYSTEM. 670 particular parenchyma from which they result does not depend upon a matter peculiar to these organs ? Glands, like every other organ, as the muscles, the bones, the mucous membranes, &c. have their tissue by which they are espe- cially characterized, a tissue in which the ar- teries communicate both with the veins and the excretory tubes. Let us go no further in our re- searches, or we shall unavoidably fall into con- jectures. Let us be satisfied with having ascer- tained the marks by which this tissue is distin- guished from all others, when acted upon with the different re-agents. We have gained a great point in having proved the characteristic attri- butes of the glandular system, without seeking for its intimate nature, which, as well as that of every other system, is concealed from us. On being dried in the air after having been cut in slices, the glandular parenchyma loses its primi- tive hue, acquires a darker shade, even blackish in the liver and in the kidneys, in whi.ch this change is chiefly owing to the blood with which these glands are permeated, since, if dried after having been cleansed of this fluid by repeated lo- tions, they remain greyish after the preparation. It is then less reduced in bulk than the greater part of the other organs. When thus dried, if dipped again in water, it will soften, and partly re-assume its primitive aspect and tendency to putrescency, which instantly begins if left in the open air.GLANDULAR SYSTEM, 671 When exposed to the air, so as not to dry, the glandular tissue yields rapidly to putrefaction : it has a more offensive smell than almost any other tissue. It appears to give out a greater quantity of ammonia. The liver particularly is the most foetid on putrefying. I know of no or- gan which, if macerated in water, will exhale a more insupportable smell. The kidneys do not putrefy quite so readily, but in this respect they are rather variable. In boiling, the glandular tissue produces at first an abundant quantity of greyish matter, at first perfectly mixed with the water, wnich is thick- ened by it, then collecting over its surface in abundance of scum. This tissue, the fleshy, the mucous, and the cellular tissues, yield the most of it by ebullition ; as the cartilaginous, the tendi» nous, the aponeurotic, and the fibro-cartilaginous tissues, &c. give the least. Let it not be thought, however, that this preliminary produce of con- coction is every where uniform in its nature ; it varies according to each system, both in quality and quantity. At least I have observed , that its appearance was never the same, its property of yielding a scum is the most permanent; but even this is very variable, and frequently perfectly null in the mucous system, &c. The broth made by boiling is highly coloured, and apparently contains less principles than that proceeding from the white organs. A correctGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 072 analysis of the broths produced by each system would be an interesting subject of research. I have found that nearly all varied in aspect, sa- vour and colour. The glands undergo in boiling a phenomenon quite peculiar to these organs : they harden when ebullition begins, and shrink at first in the same manner as every other system ; but, whilst the greater part of tfiese soften again when the pro- cess is continued, so much so as even to be dif- / fused into a pulp, the glands harden in an in- creasing ratio, and will exceed three, or even four times their natural degree of consistence. I have often repeated this experiment. Cooks are also aware of this, since on dressing a gland they are particularly attentive that it should not be boiled for too long a time. The kidneys of the ox will soften ultimately ; those of the sheep, and of man, resist much longer; they soften much sooner, however, than that of the liver, which, of all glands, acquires the greatest density. Another phenomenon that especially distin- guishes the glandular system from other parts, is that, when withdrawn, the moment it has under- gone the sudden contraction common to almost every animal solid submitted to boiling water, it has not, like these, acquired elasticity. If a tendon, a serous, or a mucous surface, &c. be drawn in opposite directions, they will lengthen and suddenly contract, the moment the cause for673 G LAN DU LA It SYSTEM. distention has ceased ; a slice of liver on the con- trary once contracted, is parted by the attempt, and can no longer contract again. The tissue of the prostrate gland seems rather susceptible of some elasticity. The want of fibrous structure in the glands appear to be the chief cause of this difference. Submitted to the sudden action of a very quick fire, as in roasting, the interna^ tissue of the liver and of other glands shrinks and contracts. From this effect there results over the surface a kind of crust impermeable in part to the juices contained within the organ, the internal substance of which is softened and cooked by these juices. This phenomenon, besides, is common to all the solids : hence in roasting meat, muscular or glandular, it is first exposed to the action of a very quick fire ; when the contraction of the surface has been pro- duced, the degree of caloric is reduced by lessen- ing the fire, and the process gently continued. When macerating in water, glands yield variously to its effect. The liver yields less than the kidneys, which after remaining for two months in vessels laid in cellars, are diffused into a reddish pulp floating in the fluid ; whilst the former for the same time, and even longer, retains its form and density: its red hue only is changed to a blueish brown, a characteristic the reverse to that of the kidneys, which, on macerating, re- main the same. The salivary glands contain a vol. ir. X XGLANDULAR SYSTEM. G74 profusion of that unctuous and rather hard whitish substance observed in every cellular part submit- ted to continued maceration. It is not the glan- dular tissue that becomes altered, but merely the fat contained within the cellular space, and here very abundant. Acids act nearly the same upon the glandular tissue as upon all the others. They diffuse it into a pulp, which values both in colour and in the time required to produce it, according to the agent employed. The sulphuric acid is invariably the most efficacious in producing this pulp, which is then black, whilst it is yellow when the nitric acid is selected. The glandular tissue resists the action of boiling acids much longer than when these are cold. I have always observed, that few systems present this difference in a more striking light. Gland* are in general more indigestible food than many other animal substances, especially when boiled ; for boiling water in respect to these organs, produces an effect quite the reverse of that observed in cartilages, tendons, and all other fibrous organs, which by this process are deprived of their density, become soft, gelatinous, even viscid, and are soon dissolved by the gastric juice. I believe that the glands would in general ba much better digested if eaten raw. Every one knows, the more the liver is cooked, the more indigestible it is> This has induced me iG75 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. to try experiments on this organ in these two different states. A part swallowed raw by a dog, was already reduced to a pulpy state in the ani- mal stomach, when another piece cooked, and swallowed at the same time had scarcely under- gone the slightest alteration. Of the Excretory Ducts, their Origin, their Divi- sions, $c. Of the Glandular Reservoirs. All the glands are provided with tubes in- tended to expel the fluid they separate from the mass of the blood: now since these tubes are observed in glands only, they must be considered with the tissue proper to these organs. The origin of these tubes is uniform in every gland, similar to the veins they originate from, a mul- tiplicity of capillary vessels forming the last ramifications of a kind of tree. These ramus- culee seem to arise from each glandular grain wherever these grains exist; so that each grain is provided with an excretory duct, an artery and a vein. Thus originating from the whole interior of the gland, these tubes soon unite to- gether, and form larger ducts, which generally cross the gland in a straight direction, converging towards each other, and uniting with other tubes still larger, which terminate differently. In respect to this termination, glands should be divided into three classes. 1st. They transmit x x c2GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 676 their fluids through different ducts, eafch of them being an assemblage of smaller tubes, opening near together, but all perfectly distinct, and with- out the slightest communication. Sometimes a a prominence exists at the point where all these ducts meet, as in the mammae, or over the breasts, in the prostrate gland, the verumontanum of which forms a kind of nipple. At other times it is a depression, a bag-like hollow that marks the place where these orifices open, as in the tonsils, upon the tongue, &c. Sometimes the surface over which the different ducts of a gland open, is even and smooth, as for those of the lacrymal gland, of the sublingual, and of almost all the mucous glands, &c. 2dly, Other glands emit their fluids through a single tube, as the parotids, the pan- creas, the sublingual, <fec. This disposition is nothing more than a modification of the pre- ceding. Where the tube opens, no projection in general is observed, the surface is smooth. 3dly. There are glands, which previous to emit- ting their fluids through their excretory organs deposit it in a reservoir where it remains for some time, and from whence it is subsequently expelled: such are the kidneys, the liver, the testicles, &c. Here, there are always two excre- tory tubes, the one proceeding from the gland to the reservoir, the other from the reservoir out- ward. These reservoirs are evidently a part ot their excretory duct.GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 677 Although the first and second species of glands have no reservoirs, the divers ramusculas, how- ever, of their excretory ducts, may in some degree be considered as such. In fact, these ramusculse, as well as those of the excretory ducts of the glands, provided with a reservoir, are habitually filled with the fluid secreted from these organs. Whatever may have been the nature of the death, the fluid of the prostrate gland may always be expressed by compressing the gland. I have even frequently squirted it out by compression. By pressure also the urine may always be forced from the kidneys. Pure bile is also seen oozing from the hepatic divi- sions when the liver is cut in slices. Semen is constantly found in the folds of the vas deferens. Milk stagnates in the cavities of the lacteal ves- sels, until it is evacuated; there is even no other reservoir for this fluid. The greater or less size of the breast during lactition proceeds only from these ducts being more or less full, &c. To this circumstance may even be referred the taste pe- culiar to each glandular tjssue, which constantly borrows some sapid particles from the fluid it separates. The kidneys, as is well known, have always a smell of urine, especially if taken from an aged animal, &c. To the same cause I also refer the different tendency in this organ, and the liver to become putrid. It is well known that bile much sooner admits of putrid fermenta-GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 678 tion than urine; whenever the latter fluid is very acid, it may in some degree prevent putrefaction: but if the liver and kidneys be comparatively exposed to its action, the latter, as I have said, will resist its effects much longer. It appears in general, that the motion of fluids through the excretory ducts is by no means so rapid, as the circulation of blood through the veins, nor even as that of lymph through the absorbents: this even will be obviously proved by the following considerations. The urine in- cessantly flows through the ureters, as is evidently ascertained by the fistulae in the loins. Now dur- ing the time the bladder fills by this uninterrupted flow, ten times as much blood flows through a vein equal in diameter to the ureter, and a much greater quantity of lymph through the thoracic duct. The degree of motion, however, is liable to numerous varieties; during the inactive state of the glands it is ten times less than when they are excited ; the proof is in the salivary fistulae, &c. With what rapidity liquids are conveyed by the ureters is perfectly known. Volume, Direction,, Termination of the Excretory Ducts. These tubes vary in size. 1st. Those passing in a certain number from the same gland, are very small, frequently even, almost concealedGLANDULAR SYSTEM. G79 from sight. They generally run in a straight direction, do not anastomose, and instantly open on reaching the surface of the gland. 2dly. Such as are single, are larger, and always in proportion to the volume of their respective gland ; excepting however the hepatic, which is evidently very small when compared with the organ it belongs to. These pass from their respective glands, originat- ing from tubes as large as the preceding; so that, if a single trunk originating from excretory ducts, separate from these, they would, in every respect, resemble the others. They only differ from them in their secondary divisions, which open immediately upon their surfaces, whilst in the others they unite into a common trunk. The pancreas is the only gland in which the course of that common trunk is concealed with- in the same gland. In the testicle only it is seen to twine, where, on this account, it is much longer. In whatever manner they are disposed, the excretory organs pour all their fluid either ex- teriorly, as the urethra and the ureters, the lac- teals, the tubes of the sebaceous glands, &c.; or inwardly from the mucous membranes, as the mucous ducts, the salivary pancreatic, prostatic, and the hepatic ducts. The two surfaces, the i . cutaneous,* and the mucous, are then the only parts wherein the excretory ducts terminate ; the only parts moistened with their fluids. TheseGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 680 tubes are never seen to open over their serous and synovial membranes, the excretory ducts of the pretended articular glands would be, (if they existed) an exception to the law of the general organization. The excretory ducts never open into the cellular tissue. If this happen to be ac- cidentally the case, either collections supervene, from irritation, such as in urinary fistulae, or callosities form along the track of the excreted fluid, and thus protect the cellular system from fatal infiltration. Hence, the mucous tube of the intestines should be considered as a kind of general excretory organ superadded to the hepatic, pancreatic . excretory ducts, &c., expelling outwardly in a mass all fluids individually poured within its tube by these organs. In fact, all secreted fluids seem as I have said, intended to be expelled from the body. Separated from the mass of the blood, they are heterogeneous to it, and never re-enter the circulation in the natural state. Although still contained within the cavities of the mucous sur- faces, they may actually be considered as exter- nal. These surfaces, in fact, are internal in tigu- / ments, intended to protect the organs from the contact of the substances they contain, a contact which would necessarily prove fatal.GLANDULAR SYSTLM. 681 Remarks upon the Secreted Fluids. The secreted fluids being intended to be out- wardly expelled, is a fact indisputably proved as to the urine, the bile that colours the foeces, saliva, &c. I have long been induced to believe that the admission of these fluids in the vascular system, must be attended with the most fatal conse- quences. I was besides supported in this opinion, 1st. By my own experience wherein I have con- stantly observed, as I have said, that, urine, bile, &c. injected in the cellular tissue, were never absorbed, but produced abscess. 2dly. By acci- dental infiltrations of urine in the parts near the bladder, from which abscesses originate. 3dly. By the fatal consequences attendant upon the effusion of this fluid on the peritoneum, in the high operation of lithotomy, of bile over the same surface in certain penetrating wounds, a two-fold instance in which these fluids are never returned to the blood by absorption, as the peritoneal serum, but in every instance almost occasion death. 4thly. By an experiment in which I had seen a dog perish soon after the urine was injected up the jugular vein. All these considerations had induced me to suppose that on being introduced into the circulation of the blood, secreted fluids constantly proved mortal after some time, and that, as several physicians had thought, (whose opinions have great weight,) all that has beenGLANDULAR SYSTEM. €82 said respecting effusions of bile into the blood, in bilious diseases, was nothing more than a collection of vague ideas, in support of which the least fact could not be produced. The importance, how- ever, of the question, for medical theories, induced me to ascertain the fact, by experiments, in an indisputable manner. In consequence I have injected bile through the jugular vein of several dogs, and which I took from the vesicle of other dogs, instantly opened for the purpose. During the first days subsequent to the injection, they seemed wearied, would not eat, were very thirsty, the eye was dull, they W’ould not move ; but after a certain space of time they gradually re-assumed their former vigour. Subsequent to this I used human bile for the same purpose ; it had the very same result, excepting in a few instances, which were attended with hic- cough and vomiting, shortly after the injection. In one instance only, the animal died three hours after the experiment; but I had used that fluid of a very deep black, sometimes found in the gall bladder, similar in appearance to thick ink, and which appears to form a great portion of the black matter vomited in some diseases. By the first of these experiments I was induced to try others with saliva : they had the very same result; only the languid state which succeeded the injection was less striking. Subsequently I tried the mucus of the nose, suspended in a sufficient quantity of683 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. water, for it will scarcely dissolve in this fluid. Finally, urine itself was tried repeatedly, not that urine proceeding from an aqueous beverage. The animals were rather more sick, but none died, ex- cepting one seven days after the experiment. On account of that I had tried three years ago, I have repeatedly renewed this; it was constantly attended with the same result, which led me to believe that, not very skilful then in experiments, I had probably admitted a bubble of air into the syringe, which most likely caused the animal’s death. The question, then, is obviously resolved by experience. Secreted fluids, though intended to be outwardly expelled in the natural state, may be returned into the circulating tide, without causing the animal’s death; the only conse- quence being more or less general disorder, ac- cording to the nature of the fluid injected. Hence, whether bile be circulated or not circu- lated with the blood, in bilious fevers, is a question I shall not examine; but most undoubtedly it may circulate with it, after having been absorbed in its ducts. I have not the least doubt that, in cases of purulent absorptions, pure pus may be circulated in the vascular system. I confess I have tried no experiment respecting the injection of this fluid, but intend to do so very soon. It is in our very nature to exaggerate every thing; undoubtedly the solids, in which the vitalGLANDULAR SYSTEM. G84 powers are particularly inherent, are especially affected in diseases ; but why should not fluids be so likewise ? why should we not seek for morbid causes as well in these as in the solids ? There are cases in which these are primitively affected, and the fluids subsequently only : thus, in cancer, in affections of the liver, of the spleen, &c. in the greatest number of organic injuries, the divers shades of yellow, grey, brown, even green, &c. invading the face, proclaim the alterations which the fluids have undergone in their hue, and consequently in their nature. In other cases the affection originates from the fluids ; as when the venom of a viper is communi- cated to the blood, as in re-absorptions of the pus from exterior collections, of that which is the focus of consumption, as in the absorption of the different contagious principles. It cannot be doubted that the different substances which may be introduced with the chyle, into the mass of the blood, are the cause of a number of diseases. Is it not the blood that conveys to the brain the narcotic principles which bring on sleep ? is it not by this same fluid turpentine and cantharides are conveyed to the kidneys, and mercury to the glands, &c. ? If opium or wine be injected into the veins, the animal will be lulled to sleep, as if the dose had been taken into the stomach. At one time it was much in use to inject the veins of living animals with medicated infusions.GLANDULAR SYSTEM. G85 By means of these infusions, purgatives, emetics, and a variety of other foreign substances were cir- culated, the contact of which the blood had to sustain, without causing the animal any other injury, except producing vomiting, and alvine evacuations ; if purgatives and emetics had been injected, a general uneasiness more or less ex- tended, if it were other foreign substances that had no affinity with any determined organ. Caustics only, such as nitric acid, the surphuric, and other very irritating substances, have caused death, in these curious experiments described by Haller, and which prove that several substances, perfectly foreign to the blood, may circulate with it *, that this fluid is a common torrent, in which a multiplicity of different principles are intermixed, but which must necessarily be always alike. In these experiments, the most important part has been neglected, that of the infusion of the various animal fluids, of secreted fluids in particular, and much more still of fluids, eventually produced in morbid states. I think that the infusion of the various kinds of pus, sanies, &c. might throw much light on the different re-absorptions. But we al- ready possess a sufficient number of facts to affirm, that fluids, and particularly the blood, may be dis- eased ; that divers heterogeneous substances mix- ing with it may produce fatal effects in respect to the solids; in fact, every sour and irritating sub- stance, without being mortal, will accelerate the686 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. action of the heart, and actually produce fever, if injected in the veins. In all these cases; the solids of necessity must act, for all morbid phenomena nearly suppose their alterations ; but the principle of these alterations rests in the fluids. Fluids are the exciting agents, solids the excited organs; now, if there is no exciting cause, the solids must necessarily remain perfectly calm. To conclude, there are cases in which the whole economy appears simultaneously affected, both in its solids and in its fluids: such are adynamic fevers, in which, whilst general prostration in- vades the former, the latter actually appear to be decomposed. Let us not then exaggerate medical theories; let us see nature in diseases as it is in the state of health, wherein the solids elaborate the fluids, and at the same time are stimulated by them. It is a reciprocal exchange of action, in which every thing comes in turn, and is connected together. Nature rarely admits of our abstract opinions ; in physic we generally adopt a certain number of principles, and then we accustom ourselves to de- duce from these principles, as an indispensable consequence, every explanation of disease. In the phenomena of physics there is a continued regu- larity and uniformity ; even in morals, there are a certain number of principles acknowledged by every man, by which they are directed, and their actions regulated ; hence the invariable uniformity687 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. iii our manner, of viewing the moral phenomena, and those of physics ; hence the habit of always starting from the same principles, on reasoning upon them. This habit we have transferred to the study of the living economy, without reflect- ing that its phenomena constantly vary, that under circumstances perfectly similar they are rarely alike ; that they are incessantly either ex- alted or reduced, and admit of a thousand various modifications. Nature seems, at every instant, fantastical and capricious, inconsistent with her- self in their production, because the essence of the laws that preside over these phenomena is not the same as that which presides over those of physics. The experiments, the results of which I have just been describing, for the secreted fluids, form a contrast with those I published last year, in which these very same fluids were attended with fatal consequences the moment they were conveyed through the carotids to the brain. This is a general phenomenon attendant upon all irritating fluids; whether they are borrowed from the economy, or are foreign to it, they cause instant death the moment they reach the cerebral organ, without having undergone any alteration, and by immediate injection ; whilst they may be injected into the veins without producing any effect, as the experiments of physicians in the last ce jected without danger, as I have observed, in ntury have proved. They might even be in-688 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. the arterial system ; in the side opposed to the brain, as in the crural artery for instance. Do fluids, on mixing with the dark blood, give oif before they reach the brain some principles by respiration ; or is the preceding phenomenon owing to some other cause ? I do not know. I have merely observed, that whatever is not arterial blood, the dark blood, and even serum, cause death when propelled through the carotids ; water only is inoffensive. When irritating fluids are diluted with a great quantity of blood, their contact is not so fatal. I have seen light coloured urine in- jected without causing death. Structure of the Excretory Ducts. All the excretory tubes are provided with an nterior membrane, which is mucous, and which is a continuation of the mucous or cutaneous surface over which they terminate ; but besides this, all present an outward envelopement, as it were, of this mucous canal. In the vas deferens this is very thick, and presents a texture we are not perfectly acquainted with. In the urethra it is of a spongy and areolar nature, filled with a quantity of blood, and analogous to the glans, which is a continuation of it. In the ureters, in the hepatic and salivary ducts, &c. it is that cellular tissue, remarkably dense and light, which has-been men- tioned, and which, by its texture, approaches to689 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. that of the arterial and venous tissue, &c. es- sentially different from the common cellular as well as from the intermuscular tissues, &c. These tubes apparently possess no membrane different from that dense tissue, and from the mucous membrane. Every excretory duct has its vessels. The ureters are evidently provided with arterial branches by the renal, the spermatics, &c. &c. The ductus choledocus is supplied by the hepatic, sienon’s duct by the fascial branch, «fcc. <&c. Dif- ferent nerves, projecting from the ganglions, at- tend the arteries and the corresponding veins; however I have constantly observed, that their ducts are never surrounded with a plexus as strik- ing as that which invests the greater part of the arteries. The excretory ducts chiefly enjoy the proper- ties of the mucous system, by which, in the greatest part, they are formed ; their sympathies also are nearly of the same nature. ARTICLE II. Parts common to the Organization of the Glandular System. Cellular Tissue. The glands differ essentially from each other in the cellular tissue that contributes to their struc- VOL. ii. Y YGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 690 ture; in this respect they might be divided into two classes. All the salivary glands, the pancreatic, the laerymal, all the glands with a granulated and whitish parenchyma, are liberally supplied with this tissue. Every glandular body is divided into very distinct lobes, separated from each other by fur- rows filled with this tissue, which gives the ex- terior of this species of glands a knobby appear- ance : not only each lobe, but each separate lobe, each grandular grain even is also immersed in cellular tissue. This species of glands actually form, in this respect, an assemblage of small bodies, distinct from each other, which, if they were insulated, would as effectually fulfil their functions. This is frequently observed over the parotids, where various accessory glands are fre- quently met with in the course of stenon’s duct, and which are perfectly independent of the princi- pal gland. The sub-maxillary and the sublingual glands, &c. are sometimes united ; at other times they are perfectly isolated. The cellular tissue is frequently overloaded with fat in these kind of glands. This is particularly striking in the mam- mae, the volume of which, at times, proceeds from the glandular tissue, as in young females, where this system predominates over the fat, and sometimes from the predominance of this fluid, as is seen when these organs, in middle aged women, retain a considerable size. This difference is readily691 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. known by the touch ; in the one case they are loose and flabby, in the other they are firm and elastic. At the period of puberty, the adipose cellular tissue also often contributes to the volume of the mammae. This explains why a very small quantity of milk is often obtained from a large breast, whilst there is an abundant supply from a smaller. In the amorous sensations we feel at the sight of that form, we are fully aware of the dif- ference, without accounting for it; the breast, whose voluptuous swell is natural, from a projection, in which the skin of the organ merely is puffed up with fat. The cellular tissue is seldom found so very predominant in the sali- vary glands, in the pancreas, &c. and is rarely formed in considerable quantity in these organs. I have seen cases, however, wherein the parotid gland resembled a greasy muscle ; but it was not increased in size. In the testis, wherein the parenchyma, as in the preceding, is disseminated in partial isolated di- visions, there is no cellular tissue to serve as a means of union. All the granulated particles are separated by a kind of thread, like excretory ducts, and in knots by cellular lamellae. Glands characterized by a tight parenchyma, as the liver, kidneys, prostate gland, the mu- cous, &c. &c. are sparingly supplied with cellu- lar tissue : on being torn in different directions, they part without the least sign of intermediate Y Y 2692 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. lamella?, tat is never found accumulated in their parenchyma. The adipose state of the liver, a state exemplified in a variety of diseases, but which is not, as was thought, an essential con- comitant of phthisis, displays a phenomenon quite different from the breast and salivary glands, when loaded with fat. The fat then forms one of the elements of the texture; in this respect it is what the colouring matter was for which it has been substituted; it is not found in the cel- lulse. It may also be extracted by ebullition, and I have remarked that the water in which such livers are boiled contains a considerable quantity of it upon the surface. The kidney also contains fat internally; but this is deposited around the pelvis, and not in its parenchyma. The tonsils, the prostate gland, the mucous glands, &c. never contain any. The serum is not extravasated in the tissue of glands with a dense parenchyma; leucophlegmasia, when very general, does not affect them. However, we cannot doubt that the cellular tissue exists in these glands ; it is demonstrated by maceration. In the fungous tumours which spring up, we find a considerable quantity ; it is chiefly about the vessels that it exists; the capsule of Glisson presents an example. Frequently even it happens, as I have pointed out, that this tissue becomes diseased, that of the gland remaining healthy. We also find that steatomatous tumoursGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 69 3 are developed in the liver, cysts containing serum in the kidneys, hydatids in both, and in the rest various productions, without the secretion being affected. These observations are particularly re- markable with respect to the liver : it is some- times increased to three or four times its usual size, by the growth of tumours within its sub- stance, without its tissue being augmented. This dilated tissue forms amongst these tumours a kind of partition, wherein the bile is separated as usual. The same thing happens in the kidneys, wherein cysts, containing serum, are found. Sometimes these cysts increase to such a degree, that the whole glandular tissue is destroyed, and replaced by a large pouch, separated by membranous par- titions, and filled with serum. I have three pre- parations of this kind. Blood Vessels. All the glands that are enveloped by a mem- brane, receive their arteries in every direction. A number of ramusculae, projecting from the ad- jacent vessels, plunge on all sides through the sur- faces of the salivary, pancreatic, lacrymal glands, &c. These arteries twine at first in the interstices of these lobes, ramify between the minute lobes, and finally penetrate the groins. Each has its own ; all communicate together ; so that the sub- maxillary artery, and the siblingual, are filled at694 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. once, by injecting through the medium of small tubes contained in the submental, in the external maxillary under the maxillary ridge, or in the lingual, quite as effectually as if the injection had been forced through the very trunk of the ex- ternal carotid. \ In glands inclosed within a membrane, as the liver, the kidneys, the testes, &c. the arteries enter at one side only, generally in a fissure more or less deep, and by a single trunk, which is very considerable ; sometimes they divide into several branches of different sizes. That part of the gland through which the artery penetrates, is always the farthest removed from the injurious operation of mechanical causes, a remark referable to all the important organs, as the lungs, intestines, spleen, &c. which, without exception, present their convex surface, that in which the vessels ramify. It should also be remarked, that the glandular system is much less liable to frequent causes of distention and contraction than the sys- tems possessed of distinct fibres; it is only when abscesses, serous, steatomatous collections, &c. form in the interior of these organs, and which frequently occur in the centre of the liver, of the kidneys, &c.; it is only then, I say, it is distended : now, in this case, it does not yield like the skin, muscles, &c.; its particles separate from each other; it is the cellular tissue in which they are immerged which uniformly dilates ; the glandular695 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. tissue is soon destroyed. This is most obvious when the collections form near the convex sur- face : if the tumour be at all voluminous, the tissue of the organ is destroyed, and nothing but a cel- lular and membranous cyst is left. We find in- stances of it in the hydatids so frequent in the exterior of the kidney. If the cyst be formed in the centre of the gland, the substance is also de- stroyed, but not so evidently. A striking proof that extensibility is very de- ficient in glands, is what is observed in regard to the liver in the corpse. I have previously stated that this organ is more or less gorged with blood, accordingly as the system of the dark circulation has been more or less obstructed at the time of death : but let the quantity of fluid it contains be what it may, its volume remains nearly the same, its tissue only is more or less compressed by the vessels ; whilst, on the contrary, the volume of the lungs, which is always very obvious,constantly shows its state of plenitude or of vacuity, so that the part the most exposed to injury, is that in which the hemorrhage is least to be dreaded. On reaching the gland, the principal artery soon di- vides into several branches, which separate and subdivide the more as they approach nearer the convex part. In their course they supply the body of the gland with a multiplicity of ramus- cuke, then terminate in innumerable capillary vessels over the convex surface. Frequently even696 GLANDULAR SYSTEM, they perforate the organ, and ramify between it and the membrane it is cloathed with ; for in- stance, on injecting the hepatic artery the convex surface of the liver is instantly covered with small black strise, which proceed from this cause. The best method to obtain a complete investigation of the glandular arterial system, is to inject the kidneys with a solid substance, then to destroy the parenchyma by maceration, or by any other means. The arterial tree is then left bare and perfectly isolated. Museums are filled with pre- parations of this kind. The large arterial trunks twine in the glands, and communicate to these organs an internal motion that materially assists their functions. This motion is the more striking, as nearly all these organs laying very near the heart by their situa- tion in the trunk, are as it were under the im- mediate influence of its contractions. The salivary glands, the mucous glands of the mouth, and the lacrymal, on the one part; the testis, the prostate, and the mucous glands of the genital organs on the other, mark the two extremes of this position. A further cause which accommodates the motion in the glands by the approach of the blood, is that the arteries which resort to them, have but a very short distance to overrun. The spermatic artery is the only exception to this rule. Thus every thing in the secretion of semen appears to be characterized by a remarkable slowness. ToGLANDULAK SYSTEM. <597 this habitual motion, impressed upon the glands by the approach of the blood, should be added, , that imparted by the adjacent organs, and which keeps up an habitual excitement still more neces- sary for their secretion than for their excretion. In the action of organs, the habitual motion by which they are agitated, has been too much dis- regarded. The example afforded by the brain should have guided the attention of physiologists in this respect. The veins every where continuous with the arteries, have in the glandular system a similar dis- tribution ; they attend them almost every where. As in many other organs a division into superfi- cial and deep seated arteries is not observed. The liver affords the only instance in which the red blood penetrates on one side, and the dark blood flows out from the opposite one. The greater part of the veins of the glandular system pour their blood into the general system of the dark circulation, and as several glands lay very near the heart, the reflux to which this system is frequently liable is felt by them. This phenomenon is particularly remarkable in the liver, where the hepatic veins open but imper- fectly under the right auricle. This explains why every time this auricle is considerably distended, as in asphyxia, or where the lungs being obstructed oppose an obstacle to the blood, the liver is gorged with a much greater quantity of this fluid. I698 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. have repeatedly proved this fact. If the weight of this organ, when the auricles are full, be com- pared with a similar organ when it is empty, (the vessels being previously tied) we shall find a remarkable difference. For the same reason a constant proportion between the weight of the liver, and that of the lungs will invariably be observed, provided no morbid alteration in the tissue of one of these organs was the cause of death. The veins of several glands, those of the mucous glands of the stomach for instance, of the intestines, the prostates, &c. pour their blood into the system of the dark abdominal circulation. Scarcely any other veins but those in the system now under consideration, particularly those of the glands of the pelvis, are liable to varices. The prostate gland, as is well known, affords fre- quent instances of this affection. Of the Blood in the Glands. The quantity of blood contained in these glands varies in an astonishing degree. These organs might even in this respect be separated into three classes. 1st. The salivary, the lacry- mal, the pancreatic glands, &c. are scantily sup- plied with this fluid. It does not provide these organs which are whitish with any colouring matter, and which, in macerating stains the water once or twice only. !2dly. Rather more699 GLANDULAK SYSTEM. blood is observed in the mucous glands, the prostate, testes, and tonsils. 3dly. The liver and kidneys are so liberally supplied with blood, that, in respect to this fluid, no kind of proportion is left between these organs, and the remainder of the glandular system. In the first organ, this rather depends upon the cause above alluded to, thus it sometimes contains a much greater quan- tity than the second, but this is not the essential cause. The same thing is observed when death has been produced by hemorrhage, when no reflux is observed in the liver or kidneys suddenly removed from a living animal. On submitting these glands to maceration, the water requires to be renewed at least ten or twelve times before it ceases to be bloody. Hence, when some organic disease of these organs are intended to be pre- served in spirits, they must be macerated for a considerable time, or the spirit would soon be thickened with blood. It is owing' to this profu- sion of blood, that these glands aro proportionally heavier than other parts of the body, and from the same cause they derive their red colour, a colour which is not so void in other parts, but which is not more inherent in their tissue than that of the mucous surfaces, or of muscles. In fact, by repeated washing it is removed with equal faci- lity. Then, the liver displays a grayish aspect, which appears to be the colour of its tissue, as ' white is that of the fleshy fibre. The kidneysGLANDULAR SYSTEM. TOO appear rather less indebted to the blood in this* respect: they retain a part of their colour in macerating; even the pulp resulting from it, still retains some degree of colour, after being immersed for some months in water frequently renewed. Does the state of the secretions cause any va- riation in the quantity of the blood contained in the glands? Is a greater quantity of this fluid conveyed to the kidneys where more urine flows from this organ, than when it separates less. Or again, the same quantity of blood being conveyed through the arteries, is a less quantity returned through the veins in the former case than in the latter? This is a very interesting subject for ex- periments. Does the blood undergo any alteration in its nature before reaching the glands ? Is this fluid submitted to some peculiar preparation previous to its penetrating each of these organs? Much has been said of this change, indispensable it has been asserted for secretion ; but to produce such a change a cause is necessary, but where is this cause ? Does not the blood circulate through the trunks which resort to the glands, as in other trunks ? Each gland then should be surrounded with an atmosphere acting upon the blood, at some distance from the point of its situation. A vague idea, resting on no solid grounds, and met with in such books only as contain . theories701 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. unsupported by facts. I have drawn blood from the carotid, spermatic, hepatic, renal arteries, <fcc.: it was red, bright, and coagulable. In the same animal, the slightest distinction cannot pos- sibly be discovered. I have observed that secretion essentially dif- fers from nutrition, in as much as it constantly borrows the materials of its fluids from the red blood, whilst the other frequently selects its own from the white fluids, as is seen in respect to the tendons, cartilages, hair, &c. Nerves. The glands are supplied with two species of nerves. 1st. The cerebral nerves are almost ex- clusively met with, in the salivary and lachrymal glands, the tonsils, &c. 2dly. The testes, the prostate, the liver, receive nearly an equal pro- portion from the brain and from the ganglions. 3dly. The kidneys and the greater part of the mucous glands are hardly supplied by any but those of the ganglia. This observation upon the nerves is referable only to such as are free and do not depend upon the arteries; for, each arte- rial trunk, on penetrating a gland, is surrounded with a nevous plexus belonging to the system of the ganglia, and strongly characterised in the large glands, as in the liver and kidneys, which are supplied with one from the semi-lunar gan-GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 702 glion, in the salivary glands proceeding from the superior cervical ganglion, in the testes from the lombar ganglia, &c. Notwithstanding what Bordeu has set forth, the nerves are in a very small proportion when com- pared with the volume of the gland. We should not, in fact, judge of this proportion by those of the parotid and of the submaxillary glans, which merely cross these glands without penetrating them, and supply them, as they proceed, with a few ramusculee only. For instance, amongst the organs which receive nerves, there are certainly none in the economy which, in proportion to size, receive less than the liver. The nerves also penetrate the glands nearly in the same manner as the blood vessels ; that is to say; 1st. On all sides for those unprovided with a membrane; 2dly. Through a fissure only for those invested by one. On reaching the organ they divide and subdivide, and are soon lost to the sight. A gan- glion is never found in the interior of a gland. Do the nerves influence the secretions ? This is highly probable, since every gland is provided with nerves, but they never impart by any means, such immediate influence as authors have pre- tended; 1st. It is said that the nerves of the pa- rotid gland were divided, and that the secretion of saliva was in consequence suppressed. Such division is obviously impossible, since the gland must be extirpated to remove the nerves; 2dly.GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 703 I once in a dog divided the nerves of the testes, the only gland that admits of this experiment, but I could not form any opinion in consequence, because inflammation of the gland ensued, and it suppurated ; still this very suppuration even im- plies that the nervous influence is not actually indispensable for secretion, since suppuration is effected by a similar mechanism. Every physi- cian is aware that a paralysed limb will inflame and suppurate ; 3dly. The erection of the penis, and the emission, although the inferior part of the body be paralized, or at least the nerves of the prostate gland. Ivan quotes an instance of a soldier who in that state had taken the venereal disease ; 4thly. The bladder being completely paralysed, its nerves deprived of all kind of ac- tion, the mucous glands of this organ, as is well known, still continue to secrete their fluid to such a degree, even as to produce mucous dis- charges ; 5thly. In hemiplegia the nostril on the diseased side is as damp as ever, and the corres- ponding ear also continues to fill with wax; flthly. In paralysis of the uvula, the action of the glands is not interrupted ; 7thly. A few days after the par vagum of one side has been divided in a dog, the bronchia in that part are found quite as much distended wTith mucus as before; 8thly. During the convulsions of the different parts provided with glands: consequently when the nerves of these glands are the more excited.704 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. their secretion is not increased; 9thly. If the proofs stated by JBordeau, respecting the influ- ence of nerves upon the secretions are properly weighed, it will be seen that they either rest upon false premises, as, section, sleep, &c. or upon erroneous notions. Physicians in general have not attached a sufficiently correct idea to the word—nervous influence. Experiments prove how far it has been misused. Whenever a nerve has been divided, paralized, or irritated in any man- ner whatever, the functions of the organ it sup- plies are not in the least disturbed ; the influence of the nerves upon the organ cannot possibly be appreciated. I do not assert that it does not ex- ist, but that we know nothing of it, and that we should not employ at random a term to which we cannot attach a precise idea. What word then should we make use of to express the influence of the nerves over the organs of our senses, over the voluntary muscles, &c. if the same be given to define an action completely unconnected with this, and which probably does not exist ? jEcchalents and Absorbents, We are little acquainted with these tubes in the interior of glands, where they are merely con- nected with nutrition.705 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Glandular System. SECTION I. Properties of the Tissue. These properties are in general rather obscure in this system ; and this appears to me to proceed from its not being of a fibrous texture. In fact, to extend and then contract, whilst a part conti- nues entire, it is necessary for the molecules of an organ to possess a certain degree of cohesion ; but it is to the fibre that this property especially belongs. It may be also remarked, that the glan- dular system is subjected to much less frequent causes of distention and contraction than the sys- tems with distinct fibres. This seldom happens but when serous and steatomatous collections take place internally, which are common in the substance of the liver, of the kidneys, &c. it is only then that it is distended ; but in this case it does not yield like the skin; the molecules se- parate ; it is the cellular tissue in which they are imbedded which is uniformly dilated ; the glan- dular tissue is soon destroyed. This is very evi- dent, when the collections of matter are formed near the convexity of the glands; however small the tumour may be, the organic tissue has VOL.. II, ^706 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. disappeared. Nothing more remains but a cel- lular and membranous cyst. The hydatids which are so frequent in the exterior of the kidneys present some examples. If the cyst be formed in the middle of a gland, the destruc- tion is also real, but it is also much less conspi- cuous. An evident proof of the slight extensibility of the glands, is what occurs in the liver of the corpse. I have already remarked, that it is more or less gorged with blood, accordingly as the system of the dark blood has been more or less obstructed previous to death. Now whatever quantity of fluid it may contain, its volume re- mains nearly the same, its tissue only being more or less compressed by the blood vessels ; whilst on the contrary the comparative volume of the lungs, which is very evident, invariably indicates their fulness or vacuity. It is probable even, that it is this difference which induced physicians to pay no regard to the state of obstruction in the liver, which varies so remarkably at the moment of death, whilst they have especially noticed these varieties in the lungs. Placed at a greater distance from the heart, the veins of the kidneys are less exposed than those of the liver to any reflux at the instant of death, when the veinous circulation meets with obstacles in crossing the lungs. This, however, is still effected, and considerable varieties in theGLA NDU L AK SYSTl’M. 707 quantity of blood gorging the large renal vessels are still observed, a quantity not depending upon that habitually contained by the organ, and which, as I have stated, is very considerable. Now the volume of this organ rarely corresponds to these varieties, because it possesses but little extensibility. In respect to the glands situate at the two ex- tremities, such as the testis on one part, the sali- vary glands on the other, the stagnation of blood cannot be perfectly observed, because the reflux is not sufficiently manifest in these parts. In this respect then, we can only judge of their extensi- bility and contractility but by analogy. The swellings in the testis, however, in con- sequence of syphilis, the tumefactions of the pa- rotids, actually prove the existence of these pro- perties in some degree. Are the liver, the kidneys, and other interior glands, liable to these acute tumefactions so frequently observed in the subcu- taneous ones? This is very probable, for physi- cians, perhaps, do not pay sufficient regard to the accessory symptoms which may arise from the pressure of these tumid organs against the adja- cent parts. Besides, this tumefaction and the contraction resulting from it, may occur in the cellular tissue of the gland, and consequently imply less extensibility in the glandular tissue than migt^at first be supposed. zz2 iGLANDULAR SYSTEM. T08 SECTION II. Vital Properties. Properties of Animal Life. Animal contractility is evidently wanting in the glandular tissue. Is this tissue endowed with animal sensibility ? Here are a few facts on this head: 1st. The compression of the parotid gland is in some degree painful. I have even, in some cases, been obliged to discontinue the me- thod of compression which had been prescribed by Desault for a salivary fistula, on account of the severity it produced ; but the numerous nerves that cross this gland might have been the cause. We are aware, that at the moment the lythoto- mist cuts the prostate, or that it is compressed by the stone and pmoere, the patient suffers great pain. The presence of calculi is often attended with excruciating pains; 2dly. A moderately strong compression of the testis is very painful,. &c. The tissue of the liver however may be di- vided, and yet the animal may give no signs of pain. After a continuation of experiments, Hal- ler has ranked the glands amongst the insensible parts. What must be concluded from all this ? That animal sensibility, modified in innumerable forms, seems to exist in a number ot organs709 GLANDULAR SYSTEM, wherein certain agents have not the power to exercise it, whilst in others it is fully developed. We are fully sensible that the various morbid al- terations obviously display it in glands. The pain attending inflammation of these organs bears a peculiar character; in most cases it is obtuse. That acute sensation which characterizes cellular inflammation, or that burning and sharp pain so frequent in the skin, &c.&c., is never experienced. Properties of Organic Life. Amongst these properties, sensible contractility is wanting in the glandular system ; but the other two are developed in the highest degree. They are in an uninterrupted state of activity. Secre- tion, excretion, and nutrition, incessantly bring them into play. It is by its organic sensibility the gland selects from the mass of the blood the materials proper for its secretion. It is, by its in- sensible contractility, or by its tonic powers, that this organ contracts and rises, if I may be allowed the expression, to expel from within these mat- ters heterogeneous to this secretion. The first exists in a trifling degree in each gland : in the tongue and the nostrils, which allow proper food only I to enter the stomach, animal sensibility is very great; the former effect in an insensible manner what the glottis so evidently effects, by convul- | sively resisting the entrance of any foreign body.*710 GLANDULAR SVM The blood contains the materials of all the secre- tions of the nutrition and exhalation of every or- gan. Each gland drawsfrom that common reservoir what is required for its secretion, as each organ borrows from it what suits its nutrition, and as each serous surface selects what serves for exhalation. Now it is by its peculiar mode of organic sensi- bility that each living part in the economy thus distinguishes what its functions require. On the fluids approaching the small vessels of the gland, this sensibility is the sentry that warns, and insensible contractility, the agent that opens or shuts the doors of the organ, accordingly as the principles must be admitted or rejected. Let me be allowed this simile, it conveys an idea of what takes place. The whole glandular action then depends upon these two properties, and as this action is, as if were, permanent, they are incessantly in action. Hence, every glandular affection must necessa- rily imply a disordered state of these properties; for as we have often seen, it is the change of properties that predominates in an organ, the exercise of which constitutes its peculiar life, which especially produces disease. This in fact is displayed by common observation. Here, we see these properties increased or lessened, produce sometimes an abundant secretion, as in diabetes, salivation from mercury, immoderate fluxes of bile, &c.; on other occasions there is a diminution, a sus-GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 711 pension even of this function, as in acute diseases, wherein every secretion is for the time arrested, as in suppression of urine, in the dryness of the mouth, &c. Changes will also take place in the sensibility of the glands which become connected with fluids heterogeneous to them in their na- tural state: hence, the innumerable varieties we observe in the secreted fluids, particularly in dis- eases. I have spoken of these varieties in the mucous fluids. They are not less numerous in the liver, and particularly in the kidneys. In the corpse, the savour, hue, consistence, and smell of the cystic bile, are detected in a thousand dif- ferent states, for who is not acquainted with the innumerable alterations of the urine ? The saliva is not so variable: in diseases, how different it is from its natural appearance. If we observe for some time the different evacuations in diseases we shall easily ascertain the multiplicity of modifica- tions of which they are susceptible. Nothing has less resemblance to urine and bile than the fluids which are sometimes expelled from the bladder and the liver: now from whence do all these varieties proceed ? It is not the variation of organic sensibility, that, as I have said before, places the organ in connection with substances which in a healthy state it would have repelled. The very same gland then without undergoing &ny change in its tissue, and by a mere changeGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 712 or modification in its vital powers, may then become the source of a multiplicity of different fluids : I even believe this may be extended so far, that the kidneys assuming a sensibility ana- logous to that of the liver, might separate pure bile ; and why should not this organ secrete it in the same manner as it separates other fluids so very distinct from its own ? In health each gland is possessed of rather an uniform mode of sensibility, a mode admitting of hardly any change: thus then all secreted fluids remain almost constantly the same in aspect, composition, and nature. But in diseases, a thousand causes incessantly contribute to change this mode. The hysteric fit acts upon the kidneys, and instantly repels all colouring principles from the urine, which flows limpid; when the fit is over, the organ re-assumes its peculiar sensibility, and the urine is restored to its natural state. The epileptic fit extends its influence to the sensibility of the salivary glands: instantly a thick, abun- dant,^ and frothy saliva, very different from what in its natural state flows from the mouth, but as soon as the fit has subsided, the fluid is restored to its usual state. Let me be allowed a si- mile. Glands are in diseases, what the atmosphere is during the equinox : at these epochs, the winds varying and changing incessantly, frequently cause a rapid succession pi rain, hail, snow, See.;GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 713 in like manner, incessantly varying in diseases, the powers of the glandular life cause a rapid change in the different secretions. It is not only upon the process of secretion that the different alterations in the organic sensi- bility and insensible contractility of the glands act, these alterations when continued, influence nutrition also, and disturb its motions : hence the alterations in the tissue, the various kinds of tu- mours, the disorganizations, &c., so frequently met with in the glandular system, one of the most productive in supplying matter for pathological anatomy. The multiplicity of organic injuries which this system presents, when compared with the major part of others, is very striking in our dissecting rooms. This, the cutaneous, the mucous, the serous, the cellular, &e., rank the first in this respect. It may also be remarked that they are precisely those in which organic sensibility and insensible contractility are the most exquisite, because thev are the onlv ones wherein these are brought into play, not by nutrition only, but also by different other functions effected in the insensible capillary system, namely, by exhala- tion, absorption, and nutrition. Sympathies. Few systems are so frequently the seat of sym- pathies as this. In considering them I shall714 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. follow the same order as in the preceding chapter. . Passive Sympathies. The glandular tissue answers with the utmost readiness to the excitement it receives from the other organs. This is what constitutes passive sympathies. They occur first in the natural state, secondly, in disease. I say first, there are certain cases in the natu- ral state, wherein other organs being excited the glandular system comes into action. This is par- ticularly remarkable in the mucous system. We have seen that nearly all the excretory tubes terminate on the mucous surfaces: now the moment one of these surfaces is excited in the i vicinity of these tubes, the action of the gland belonging to that tube is increased. 1st* The presence of food in the mouth causes a more abundant secretion of saliva. 2dly. The bougie fixed in the bladder, and irritating the ureters or the neighbouring parts, increases the flow of urine. 3dly. The irritation of the glans, and of the extremity of the urethra, in the act of coition, creates a kind of spasm in the testes, from which an abundant secretion of the seminal fluid arises. 4thiy. Every irritating fluid, applied either to the tunica conjunctiva of the eye, or to the pituitary membrane of the nose, will cause tears to flow more or less abundantly. 5thly. In trying ex-715 £ LA NHL'LA 11 SYST11M. periments relative to the state of the gastric viscera during digestion and hunger, I have no- ticed , that as long as the food has not left the stomach, the supply of bile is rather scanty, but that it flows in abundance the moment it enters the duodenum ; so that a quantity of this fluid is then found in the intestines. During hunger the gall-bladder is much distended; a small quantity of bile only flows from it. Towards the latter stage of digestion, and even when this is partly effected, it contains half the previous quantity. It ought, however, to empty much sooner during abstinence, when the fluid it then contains is of a dark green, very bitter, very acrimonious, and consequently very irritating. In the course of digestion, or immediately after this function is effected, it is not so deeply coloured, is of a light yellow colour, and is less irritating. Another stimulant then is required during digestion ; now, that stimulant is the food crossing the extremity of the ductus choledocus. In my treatise on the membranes I have given a circumstantial account of the course of the cystic and hepatic bile. Let us conclude from these numerous conside- rations, that one of the principal agents nature selects to increase the action of the glands, and to promote that of their excretory ducts, is the sympathetic irritation at the extremities of these tubes which open upon the mucous membrane.GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 716 To this must also be referred the divers catarrhs proceeding from the presence of an irritating body on one of these surfaces. The child by sucking and exciting the nipple, causes a secretion of milk, whilst at the same time he draws in the fluid, &c. In the morbid state, the glands are also fre- quently the seat of passive sympathies, now in such cases the organic sensibility and insensible contractility are generally brought into action. The increase of animal sensibility from sympathy will rarely give pain. We have enumerated the astonishing varieties observed in glands, both in respect to the quan- tity, and to the quality of the fluids they separate. Now all these varieties especially proceed from sympathetic influence. Let us only observe the salivary glands filling the mouth with fluid, or leaving it dry, with a viscid humour, or a limpid one, frothy, or fluent; the mucous glands of the tongue furnishing sometimes a thick and whitish slime, at others a blackish crust, &c. Physicians look to the state of the tongue as an infallible sign of that of the stomach, and in general this is correct. Nature has so far connected these parts by sympathy, that the instant the mucous ' surface of the latter is diseased, that it has be- come the seat of that kind of discharge called disordered stomach, foul stomach, &c. then that of the other al$o becomes aflected, and furnishes aGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 717 larger quantity of mucous juices, which impair or destroy the appetite, and thus prevent the stomach from taking food it could not digest, and which frequently it could not bear. The tongue then, as during health, is a kind of sentry placed before the stomach, to refuse what might prove inju- rious, and admit what may suit this organ: hence the astonishing; influence which this has over the other in diseases. But it must also be remarked, that the tongue is sometimes furred, although the stomach is not disordered. This state is fre- quently met with in hospitals; I have repeatedly observed it. Disgust, nausea, &c. are also often experienced when the tongue continues clean. Shall I mention the innumerable influences to which the liver, the kidneys, and the pancreas, are liable ? As soon as any organ of the animal economy is diseased, the glands sympathise in- stantly ; their secretion is increased, diminished, vitiated ; and frequently even, it is only through these functions that the sympathetic affections are conveyed, producing inflammations, suppurations, &c. Collections of fluids in the liver have been detected subsequent to wounds in the head, &c. Shall I enumerate the great variety in the quan- tity of tears attendant upon acute diseases, inflam- matory and malignant fevers, &c. ? Who is not aware, that in such cases the eye is more or less moist, that frequently even tears continue to flow from this organ. Now what is the cause of theseGLANDULAK SYSTEM* 718 varieties?—the sympathetic influence acting' upon the lachrymal gland. Frequently even the disease has nothing to do with it; but then that unknown consent which binds together the dis- eased parts, brings them into play. In a number of passions tears are generally shed; and the reason is, because the passion first extends its in- fluence to an epigastric organ, as is proved by the shock experienced in that part, and the affected organ re-acts upon the lachrymal gland. Tears are shed as in fear, when the skin is covered with a cold perspiration ; as in fury, when the saliva flows in abundance ; a phenomenon vulgarly ex- pressed by these words, to foam with rage, fyc. The testes and the prostate gland are much less frequently sympathetically excited by dis- eases than any of the other glands: whilst every thing is in confusion in the glandular system, these commonly remain calm and in- ert as it were. Why is this ? Because they are se- parated from the other glands by their functions. The salivary and pancreatic glands, the kidneys, the liver, almost all mucous glands, concur to the same end, namely, to digestion. This is con- nected with the existence of most other organs. We should not be surprized then, if glands sym- pathize when they are diseased. Solely intended for generation, its action beginning much later, and ending much sooner than that of any other gland, remarkably intermittent in its functions,719 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. the testis on the contrary, in its affections could not thus be concerned in the diseases of any other organ. This, however, is sometimes the case. It is well known, that certain affections of the lungs will provoke the sexual appetite ; that in the natural state, certain parts of the skin being rather quickly excited, that of the nates espe- cially, will rouse the whole genital system into action, &c. &c. We are well acquainted with that remarkable sympathy which lays the breast under the depend- ance of the womb. We are aware that at every re- turn of the periodical discharge, the breasts rather swell; that cancer frequently takes place at the period menstruation ceases; that the voluptuous sensation of coition is sometimes extended up to the breasts, &c. Every physician has remarked those connections of sympathy, which are seem- ingly of a peculiar nature, and depend upon an analogy of functions in the two sympathizing organs. Subsequent to long continued and acute diseases, to fevers especially, the glandular action is fre- quently considerably increased, and copious evacu- ations take place. These form a crisis, and thus ac- cording to the opinion of many, the morbid cause is expelled: this is a phenomenon that ought to be re-examined, and which undoubtedly, in a number of cases, does not, as I shall prove, depend upon the cause ascribed to it.GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 720 Although I have considered as sympathetic several disordered secretions in diseases, I am very far, however, from thinking they are all so. In a multiplicity of cases, there-is certainly a ge- neral affection of the whole system, an affection of which the glands, as well as all the other parts, partake ; it is what takes place in some fevers, &c. But whenever a system is especially affected, as the cutaneous, in smail-pox, meazles, scarlatina, &c.; the serous in pleuritis, in perito- nitis, &c.; the cellular in phlegmon ; the nervous in convulsions, &c.; or whenever the symptoms do not proceed from any injury which their tissue may have sustained, I call it sympathetic. Other ideas may be attached to the word sym- pathy ; but such is the meaning I attach to it; and if we agree in this respect, it is of little con- sequence what term we employ. Active Sympathies. These sympathies are not so frequent as the preceding, however they are observed in the diseases of the glandular system. The cata- logue of inflammations of the kidneys, salivary glands, liver, &c. abound in the sympathetic phenomena of the other systems. I do not mean the disordered states of digestion and circulation, functions which being naturally connected with the secretions, must unavoidably be disordered721 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. when these are vitiated. I am speaking of the organs which, not being immediately connected with the diseased glands, will however sympa- thize, as is seen in convulsions, spasms, in the vague or fixed pains felt in different parts, in perspirations, <&c. During health, the testis bears a remarkable in- fluence over the organs of the voice. We know that the voice is more sonorous as this organ ac- quires more energy ; that it changes on its being removed by castration. This phenomenon never varies. Barthez had thought it was an exception to the common sympathetic phenomenon; in fact, it appears to be nothing more than a pecu- liar modification of that general influence the testes exert over all the vital powers, which are constantly increased or diminished accordingly as its action is in a state of debility or of energy. There are, however, certain organs more inclined than others to feel these affections. The mucous system of the chest affords an instance of it; its passive hemorrhages are a frequent result of an excess in the secretion of semen : consumption is frequently the fatal consequence of it. i!i h Character of the Vital Properties. First Character.—Fife peculiar to each Gland. The life of the glands resulting from the pre- ceding powers in a state of action, is not uniform a a vor,. TTGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 722 throughout the system, undoubtedly because the texture differs in each gland, and that to each individual tissue a peculiar modification of vital- ity is attached. A variety of phenomena result from these differences, so judiciously described by Bordeu. 1st. Each gland has some peculiar substances with which it is exclusively connected in the na- tural state. Thus it is the salivary glands do not separate bile, that the liver suffers the materials for urine to flow through its vessels without sepa- rating its fluid : from this cause the diversity in secretion results. This also explains why can- tharides act exclusively upon the kidneys, why mercury especially affects the salivary glands, why certain substances operate in a peculiar man- ner upon the testes, increase their secretion, and even command the excretion of semen; why again some kinds of food give more milk than others. I am convinced that some substances act especially upon the mucous glands, and dispose them to secrete more abundantly, &c. 2dly. Each gland has its peculiar mode of sym- pathizing. We have seen the testes especially sympathize with the pectoral organs, the liver with the brain, the kidneys, when the seat of pain, to influence the stomach, and cause vomit- ing. The breasts and the womb are intimately connected together by sympathies. 3dly. Every glandular inflammation puts on723 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. a particular character. That of the kidneys does not resemble that of the liver, of the testis, &c. Inflammation of the prostate gland gives rise to symptoms quite distinct from those of the latter organ, &c. I am not alluding to the differences that result from the diversity of fluids, but merely to those connected with the difference of tissue. 4thly. Each gland is affected with diseases proper to itself, or at least for which it is more disposed than others. Hydatids are often ob- served near the convex part of the liver, but I have never met with any in the salivary glands, or in the testis. Although the parotid gland is quite as much exposed to mechanical injury as the latter organ, yet two cases of sarcocele to one scirrhus will be observed in this gland. The liver, amongst these organs, is the only one that has been found in that peculiar state, called an adipose state ; no gland is so frequently the seat of steatoma as this. Physicians, who have gone through no regular course of dissection, indis- criminately apply the vague and insignificant words, of obstruction, empdtement, &c. to ev^ry kind of glandular tumour. But let it be remarked, that, in general, these tumefactions have nothing more in common than an increase in bulk; their nature is quite distinct, and yet in respect to several of them, what has been the progress of art up to this very day ? The moment an ob- struction is ascertained in the liver, by touch, 3 a 2724 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. instantly aperients, &c. are the common specifics generally prescribed for hydatids, steatoma, and scirrhus, with marble-like granulations, or for the adipose state of the liver, and for a thousand other alterations, from which an increase in bulk may result, as if it were the increase itself, and not the nature of the tumour from which it proceeds, they had to contend with. Why do we not also pre- scribe aperients when the liver, displaced by hydrothorax, has exceeded its natural size ? it would be quite as rational. 5thly. Every gland presents peculiar modifi- cations, in what are called critical evacuations? of which it is sometimes the seat subsequent to long diseases, &c. &c. 6thly. To the differences in the vitality of the different parts of the glandular system again, must also be referred the following phenomenon : some particular glands are brought to act spon- taneously, either by stimulant directly applied, or by sympathetic excitation, such as the lachrymal gland for instance, which, from a state of langour, passes spontaneously, during passion, to that of abundant secretion. To stimulate other glands, on the contrary, some time is required, as the kidneys, the pancreas, &c. which cannot probably pour out their fluids so rapidly, however much they may be stimulated. The same agent, acting upon the tunica conjunctiva, will both cause tears to flow and increase the action of the meibomianGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 725 glands ; but the increased action of the lachrymal gland precedes, for some time, that of the latter. The application of stimulants to the mucous sur- faces cannot produce a catarrhal flux immediately. Second Character.—The Remittent State of the Glandular Action. The second character relative to the glands, is their liability to habitual and alternate increase and diminution. Sleep especially bears upon the animal functions; these only are completely sus- pended in the ordinary state, and this is what constitutes sleep. But the glands also rest in some degree, although the remission of action is never perfect, except in disease. I compare the sleep of animal life with the calm intervals of in- termittent fevers ; and the repose of the glands with those of remittent fevers, wherein the fit is only moderate, but uninterruptedly continued. Whenever food crosses the mouth, saliva is most abundantly supplied ; at any other time this cavity is only moistened. Whilst chyle is pass- ing into the duodenum, the pancreas and the liver pour out their fluids abundantly: they are also active, but much less so during hunger. I have convinced myself of this, by comparing a number of experiments made during digestion and hunger; experiments I published some time since. WeGLANDULAR SVSTEM 726 know that soon after a meal the kidneys are par- ticularly active. Intermission of the action in the mammae is nearly as substantially proved as that of the organs of animal life. Each mucous gland has its proper time for secretion : it is when the mucous surfaces, to which their excretory ducts resort, come in contact with any substance, either stagnating upon, or merely crossing these organs. We should not only then conceive the glands as constantly separating a fluid from the blood, but as being more active at certain periods, and emit- ting consequently more fluids. This remittent state in the glands seems to pro- ceed from a cause rather analogous to that of sleep, which, in animal life, is the result of the lassitude experienced by jthe sensitive organs, and by those of locomotion, after rather long con- tinued exertion ; the kind of weariness glands admit of, is not generally attended with a painful sensation, as in animal life; its nature seems to be quite different. However, after long suckling^ females feel a kind of drawing in the breast, by which nature warns them it is time to cease. The testes, when the emission of semen has been re- peatedly forced, become the seat of a painful sen- sation, &c.GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 727 Third Character.— The Glandular Action is never simultaneously excited throughout the System. The vital properties of the glands are never simultaneously excited in all. When one is active the others are in a passive state. It might be thought there was but one sum of vitality granted for all, and that one could not partake of more without the others enjoying less. To this law the order of digestion is submitted. In the first stage, the salivary glands pour out an abundant quantity of fluids ; in the next, the parietes of the stomach fulfil this office ; in the third, when the chyle passes into the small intestines, the liver and the pancreas are particularly active ; in the fourth, the mucous glands of the large intestines supply their fluid, and finally the kidneys also act their part in expelling the residue of the fluids. It is im- possible that all the glands should act at the same time: in this respect they may be compared to some exterior motions^ in which some muscles are at rest, whilst others contract. The most im- proper time for coition is during digestion, be- cause then we compel the mucous, hepatic, pan- creatic secretions, &c. to accord with those of the testes. The secretion of one gland, in diseases, can only be increased at the expence of the others ; a fact that is proved by daily observation. Some advantage, as I have said, might be de- rived from this remark, by producing in the dif-728 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. ferent glandular affections, and in others, artificial catarrhs, which we can produce at will, since it merely requires the application of a foreign sub- stance to the mucous surfaces. For some time I have often ‘ prescribed the use of ammonia, re- spired through the nose. Pinel recommends its use in epilepsy. There are a variety of other instances in which its use would prove most bene- ficial, as in certain cases of head-ache, in remittent fevers, in some cases of apoplexy, in the different comatose affections, &c. Blistering requires some time before it operates; four, five, six hours even will elapse before any irritation can possibly be produced. Who is not aware that frequently, even in diseases attended with great prostration of strength, its action upon the cutaneous system is perfectly null ? The excitement of the pituitary membrane, on the contrary, by ammonia, is con- stantly sudden, and infallibly effectual. Its effect, it is true, is of short duration, but this is precisely the advantage resulting from its application ; for, in a variety of cases, blistering is useful at the moment only it creates irritation on the skin; hence the practice of allowing the part to heal, and repeating the blister afterwards. The agency of ammonia, or of any other powerful stimulant, applied to the pituitary membrane, might be re- peated every fifteen minutes, every five or six minutes, even every minute in short. If by habit it loses its effect upon the patient, another irritat-GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 729 ]ng substance might be substituted for it, whilst cutaneous excitement, by blistering, could not thus be repeated. What I recommend respecting the pituitary membrane relates to those of the rec- tum, of the urethra, and of the stomach, to which, in many cases of disease, stimulants might be ap- plied with more advantage than by blistering the skin. Besides, the character of the glandular action we are now considering is merely an isolated modification of a general character common to every vital power, a character consisting in its action being diminished in one part as it is in- creased in another. This explains why extensive suppurations, large tumours, dropsies, &c. are constantly attended with loss of power in the glandular action. Upon this character is grounded the practice of blisters, setons, moxa, issues, &c. which do not act as was pretended, by evacuating the morbid matter, but by relieving the irritation in the diseased part by that artificially produced in another. Fourth Character.—Influence of Climate and Season upon the Glands. \ From the preceding character another pheno- menon is derived, which may also be considered as characterizing the glandular system ; namely, that in general it is more active in summer thanGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 730 in winter, in cold than in hot climates. In fact, heat, by which the cutaneous system is dilated increases its action at the expence of that of the glands; and reciprocally, cold, by which this membrane is condensed, checking its habitual exhalation, compels the glandular system to in- crease its action in turn, and compensate for the deficiency. Hence it is that the very same quantity of fluid admitted into the economy is during win- ter discharged by urine, in summer by perspira- tion ; that, to effect in summer instantaneous eva- cuation of urine, perspiration must be suppressed by the sudden application of cold on the surface of the skin, by entering a cellar or some subterra- neous vault, &c.; so that during summer the resi- due of fluids may be expected either through the urinary organs, or by means of perspiration, ac- cording to the temperature of the atmosphere in which digestion is effected; hence, why tisanes and diuretics should not be given at the same time, and why a physician who would indiscriminately re- commend their use, would prove how ignorant he was of the laws of our economy ; why the greater part of diseases attended with an immo- derate flux of secreted fluids, are most generally characterized by a diminution of the exhaled fluids; why, in particular seasons, diseases have more tendency to manifest themselves by perspi- ration, and in others to terminate in the evacua- tion of mucus, urine, &c. To the vital activity731 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. of the glandular system being more considerable during winter, must also be referred the fre- quency of catarrhs, the greater number of which proclaim an unnatural increase of its action, and the greater facility with which the kidneys admit of being influenced by cantharides, &c. in that season. In the treatment of diseases, physicians ought never to lose sight of these considerations. The glandular system should be more acted upon during winter, and the cutaneous during summer, because each system is so much the better disposed to answer the stimulants directed to it as its function is certainly increased. Fifth Character.—Influence of the Sex upon the Glands. ' Is the life of the glandular system more active in the male than in the female sex ? In respect to the glands intended for digestion, secretion of tears, evacuation of urine, &c. little difference is observable between the two sexes. In what re- lates to the general glands, man has, in addition to his share, the testes and prostate gland, the female the breast; so that there is a mutual ba- lance. It should be remarked, however, that the influence of the former upon the economy is much superior to that of the latter. From the womb proceeds that sympathetic influence which corresponds to that from the testes in every other organ of man.GLANDULAR S\STEM„ 732 ARTICLE IV. Developemenl of the Glandular System. 'section i. State of this System in the Foetus. Although the secretions are not very active in this subject, the glandular system generally predominates. The salivary and pancreatic glands are larger in proportion than subsequently. The liver is enormous: the kidneys are also propor- tionally larger than those of the adult; probably the mucous glands partake of this disposition, al- though I have made no very precise enquiries on this point. Several vary in their forms; the kidneys, for instance, evidently display knobs, whilst, in a subsequent stage, their surface is almost smooth, nor is the hue the same. This distinction is particularly obvious in the salivary and the la- chrymal glands. Whitish in the adult, these glands display a remarkable redness, of which they are deprived by ablution, and which does not depend upon the blood circulated through their vessels, but is a part of their tissue. This hue never as- sumes so deep a shade in the pancreas, although the texture of this organ is nearly the same. The glands, like the other parts, are remarkably soft and delicate at that stage. They divide and give way with the greatest facility, and theirglandular system. 733 innumerable vessels liberally supply them with fluids. At this period these organs correspond to the re- mittent state in the adult; they separate less fluid, although apparently in constant action. All their receptacles, in fact, would not suffice to contain their fluids, if in a limited time the same quantity were secreted as in the early days of infancy. Does this proceed from the dark blood of their parenchyma at this time not being calculated to provide them with the materials for secretion ? This cause may have some influence, and even this conjecture had struck me before, from having observed the want of power in the dark blood to maintain several other functions. But the essen- tial reason in my opinion is, that, in the foetus, the nutritive motion of composition evidently predominates over that of decomposition; the latter is rather obscure ; for almost every thing conveyed to the organs remains there, and whilst in that situation supplies them with the materials for that rapid increase observed in the body in that early stage of life. Now the secretions being especially intended to evacuate the residue of nutrition, they cannot possibly be very active at that period. Digestion besides, never conveys to the blood any of those principles which, not being calcu- lated for nutrition, must on that account be ex- pelled as they were admitted ; that is to say, with-734 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. out having contributed to form any integral part of our organs ; such are, for instance, the greater number ol beverages, which merely cross the mass of the blood, and are immediately evacuated in urine. The glands of the foetus then are like the brain at that early age; though considerably developed, they are inactive. SECTION II. State of the Glandular System during Growth. At birth, the glandular system undergoes a sudden increase of energy, and begins to pour out more fluid. It is indebted for this change ; 1st. To the difference in the blood, which, previ- ously dark, and consequently veinous, becomes red, and is on that account loaded with principles it was not previously connected with; 2dly. To the general and sudden irritation conveyed to the extremities of all the excretory tubes, by food, in respect to those opening in the canal extended from the mouth down to the anus; by air, in respect to the mucous ducts of the bronchia, pituitary surfaces, and the lachrymal gland; by the divers frictions of the extremity of the glands, and even by the air itself, which also acts upon it in regard to the kidneys and bladder. All the glands are more readily excited, be- cause the stimulants are quite new to them. TheirGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 735 sensibility, so far torpid as it were, is roused; they feel the contact effected by the approach of the blood, which till then had made but a very slight impression upon them. This sensation is so much the more delicate, as the organic sensibility of the glands is better developed, and as the red blood is • a more powerful stimulant than the dark; for, as I have already had frequent opportunities of repeat- ing the observation, two effects are produced on the blood that reaches an organ, the one to excite it either by the motion it imparts, or by, the con- tact of the principles it contains, and the other to supply it with the materials for divers functions, as exhalation, secretion, nutrition, &c. The former effect is shared in common by all organs in which blood is circulated ; the latter is peculiar to each. I have remarked, however, that many of the secretions are much less energetic during the early stage of infancy, than at a more advanced period. Such are those of the salivary glands, of the liver, &c. The kidneys being intended to throw off the residue of digestion, as much and even more than that of nutrition, are in a state of activity'proportionate with the first of these functions. The evacuation of urine in the child takes place as often as that of the faeces. This does not proceed from an abundance of substances being returned from the organs to the kidneys, after having contributed to their nutrition, to be expelled through that channel.glandular system. 736 In the early stage of infancy, the affections of the glandular system are not those which predo- minate ; 1st. In the tumefactions so frequently detected in the region of the parotid gland, these glands are not obstructed, but in general the lymphatic; 2dly. At that age, as is well known, the overflow of bile, and affections re- sulting from it, are very rare; 3dly. The secre- tions that relate to generation do not exist; 4thly. Organic affections of the liver and kidneys are as rare in the infant as they are common in the adult. Then it is that what are so improperly called lymphatic glands, the brain, &c. af- ford to pathological anatomy a full scope for enquiry; for it should be observed that the or- gans which are the most active at a certain stage of life, are precisely the most liable to acute and chronic diseases at that age, whilst those whose functions are still obscure are seldom affected ; i 5thly. Surgeons are aware that sarcocele, hy- drocele, varicocele, and the whole vocabulary of the diseases of the testes, are as rare previous to the age of puberty, when no other func- tion is effected in these glands but that of nu- trition, as they are frequent in the subsequent years. It appears then that the mucous glands are the oftener affected, and of course are the most active. The lachrymal glands are also frequently brought into action. Tears are more repeatedly shed in in-737 glandular system. fancy than in the adult age. It may be said that all the passions at this age have but one mode of being expressed, which is, the shedding of tears; whenever the infant suffers, it is denoted by- crying. The influence of the passions upon the lachrymal glands at this tender age seems to be produced at the expence of that exercised over the other glands. Fear, terror, &c. rarely occa- sion jaundice, or an increased flow of bile. At that age the urine and faeces are not so frequently evacuated from fear as in the following years; and the spasmodic vomitings, so frequently caused by passion in the adult, are not so repeatedly observed in childhood, nor the paleness or flush- ing of the face: hence the features are not so variously agitated by the motions of the soul. In anger the eye is not fiery, it is not expressive of friendship, &e. It should be observed that this mode of expression belongs to weakness; it is peculiar to the female, who in many respects may be compared to the infant. The helpless deer opposes nothing but tears, when the dog, its savage pursuer* seizes upon him. In infancy, the glandular texture continues for a long time soft and delicate. At birth, and previous to it, the liver and the kidneys are not possessed of that singular faculty of being' har- dened by boiling. During this experiment they remain soft, and easily give way to the slightest impression; for whatever length of time concoc- vol. ii. 3 BGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 738 tion is continued, they are never deprived by it of this character, which gradually declines as age advances, and which at a later period renders them fit in our kitchens for uses they could not originally answer. SECTION III. State of the Glandular System subsequent to Growth. Puberty manifests itself towards the time growth is completed. A gland so far inactive in man is suddenly roused into action. The prostate follows it in its progress. In the female the breasts swell, widen from each other, and assume, in a very short space of time, a volume they could not have acquired had they followed in their growth the same rules they were governed by in the preceding stage. Instead of weakening in proportion as these become stronger, the action of the other glands is also increased and strength- ened ; they gradually lose the softness by which they were characterized in infancy, and become harder. So far, in the general nutritive motion, the pro- cess of composition has predominated over that de- composition. Almost as much substance was habi- tually expelled from each organ as was deposited for the purpose of nutrition. Now, as the glands form the great emunctory through which theGLANDULAR SYSTEM. 739 residue of nutrition is expelled, these organs then shed proportionally more fluid than before. In youth, the genital glands actually predomi- nate, they seem to be the focus from which ori- ginate those irradiations which animate the whole machine. It may be said, that in general they are in the mechanism of our moral actions, the spring that sets every thing in motion. In proportion as we recede from youth, the in- fluence of. the genital glands decays, because they are less active; towards thirty-six or forty, those intended for digestion especially predominate over the others, and amongst these the liver seems particularly active. At this period the bilious affections predominate. Now the passions to which we seem inclined by a bilious constitution more frequently disturb the mind. Ambition, enmity, and jealousy, are frequently the fatal attributes of that age. The passions are more ■ i durable. The levity of youth, those passions arising from the influence of the genital glands, predominate at that age, and stifle for a time, or rather prevent the latter from being manifested. These now govern in turn, whilst those arising from the influence of the general organs evapo- rate with youth. The lively emotions of the soul specially bear upon the glands and upon the abdominal viscera. That contraction in the epigastrium, so painful an effect of melancholy, • is more strongly felt. Jaundice produced by 3 b 2740 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. grief is more frequent, &c. This age is the time for the organic affections of glands, for the in- numerable changes their tissues undergo, for the production of their excrescences, which, disorgan- izing, as it were, these organs, convert them into forms of quite a different texture. In infancy, leucophlegmasia was most commonly produced by an obstruction in the lymphatic mass called glands, they coincided with the tumid belly, with obstructions in the bronchial glands, &c. In the adult, on the contrary, they are generally found connected with the diseases of the liver, of the spleen, of the kidneys, &c. SECTION IV. State of the Glandular System in Old Age, In the aged subject, the glands become gra- dually more consistent and harder. Those of animals are no longer selected for our meals. The liver, the kidneys, the spleen, &c. are joined with our boiled meat, for the benefit of a few salts only, and of a few savoury principles, which the other tissue does not possess. They are not eaten, or at least they have a disagreeable taste. The lungs, which contain such a population of mucous glands, form a digestible food in the calf only ; those of the bullock are expunged from our tables, especially if the animal be old. In this respect741 glandular system. I have remarked, that the muscular and glandular systems are in a reverse order to digestion, at least in that state to which we reduce them for our meals. The glandular system, in fact, is savoury, and easy of digestion, in young animals only, whilst at that age the muscle is flat, and does not become palatable food until towards the middle stage of life. The colour of the glands undergoes less change from excessive age than that of the major part of other organs. The liver, the kidneys, &c. are found to contain nearly as much blood as in the adult; they are quite as red ; whilst pale and dis- coloured, the muscles prove by their hue how scantily they are supplied with blood. We might be led to conclude that this fluid first forsakes the skin and the muscles of animal life which in the trunk lay subjacent to it, and which in the limbs are far distanced from the heart, or at least that it is considerably diminished in the two sys- tems, and concentrated in the organs nearer to the heart. Thus in the aged subject the secre- tions are still very abundant, whilst the muscular and nervous powers, &c. are considerably re- duced. The kidneys still secrete a quantity of urine, the liver still procures abundance of bile, although this organ has partly lost that kind of predominance it possessed in the prime of life. Catarrhs, remarkably frequent at that advanced age, as is well known, prove an increase of action742 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. in the mucous glands, whilst the testes and the breasts have long ceased their functions. The activity of glands that still fulfil their office seems to depend upon two causes; 1st. Decomposition being striking at that age, a pro- fusion of substances are conveyed to these'glands to be expelled. The decay of the aged subject is a phenomenon the reverse of the rapid growth in the foetus, in which the glandular system hardly rejected any thing out of the economy; 2dly. The skin wrinkled and contracted, partly ceasing to be an emunctory for the produces of decompo- sition, the glands act as substitutes for these func- tions. The cutaneous and glandular systems are then in the very same connection, as they are during winter and in cold climates ; whereas we have seen the functions of the one are often suc- ceeded by those of the other. The glandular system in general is one of those from which life departs most slowly. In the aged corpse, the gall bladder is still found filled with bile, the bladder with urine, &c. All the glands on being compressed, the prostate even, emit abundance of fluid from their excretory ducts. I have even observed that more fluid is generally obtained by compression from the aged subject than from the infant. The older the ani- mal, the stronger the smell of urine in the kid- ney. The lungs, so liberally supplied with mu- cous surfaces, and therefore with glands, are nei-GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 743 ther faded nor contracted in old age, they fulfil their office with the same precision as during It is a very remarkable phenomenon, that all the important organs, the liver, the kidneys, the spleen, the heart, the lungs, &c. still retain a remarkable degree of vitality, whilst the sensitive organs, and those of locomotion, by this time nearly exhausted, have partly destroyed the com- munications which connected the individual with the surrounding objects.SYSTEM OF THE DERMIS, All animals are invested with a membrane more or less dense, generally proportionate in thickness to the volume of the body. This is intended both to protect the subjacent parts, ta expel a considerable portion of the residue of nu- trition and digestion, as well as to connect the ani- mal ^vith exterior forms. To man it is a sensitive limit, placed on the boundaries of his soul, with which limit these forms incessantly come in con- tact, to establish the connections of his animal life* and thus bind his existence with that of all that surrounds him. This envelopment is the dermisy or the skin ; and the parts of which it is composed we will term the dermoidal system. ARTICLE I. i Form of the Dermoidal System. Proportionate with the exterior parts it in- vests, the envelopment formed by this system is745 dermoidal system. applied and moulded upon the uneven surface of these parts, and whilst the most striking pro- minences remain, the rest are in a great measure concealed from the sight. Thus the outward as- pect of a subject, from which the skin has been removed, is very different from the appearance of a corpse. Every: where continuous, this envelopment is reflected through different apertures to the in- terior of the body, and affords an organ to the mucous system. The limits between these two systems are constantly traced by a reddish line; within this line is the mucous system, outwardly is that of the dermis. The demarcation, how- ever, is not so striking in the organization as in colour ; they are both blended together in an in- sensible manner. In the vicinity of these open- ings, especially of those of the face, the dermis is thinner, and at the immediate orifice of the mu- cous membranes, as I have said before, partakes more or less of the character of the former. SECTION i. External Surface of the Dermoidal System. Contiguous in every part to the^dermis, this surface is remarkable for the hair with which it is covered, the oily humour it is habitually lubri- cated with, for the perspiration that collects over746 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. it, and for the sensation of touch of which it is the seat, and to which its internal surface is a perfect stranger. In this article we shall pass these divers subjects unnoticed, to consider merely the exterior forms of the dermis. Different folds are observed in this surface: 1st. Some arise from the adjacent muscles, which being intimately attached to the dermis, wrinkle it on contracting; such are the wrinkles of the forehead, produced by the subjacent muscles; those of a radiated form, produced by the or- biculares round the eyelids, &c.; those which form on the cheeks when the zygomatic muscles, &c. contract; those with which orbiculares oris surround the mouth, on contracting the lips, &c. All these folds proceed on the one hand, from the skin being unable to contract like the muscles, and on the other hand, that it is requisite it should occupy less space in length at the moment these shorten. They are of a similar nature to those which are formed on the mucous surfaces, par- ticularly to those of the stomach, when the fleshy layer contiguous to them contracts. Thus the direction of these folds is invariably perpendicular to these muscles; they divide by rectangles. Considerable importance is annexed to these mus- cles in the expression of the passions, because they are then more strongly characterized. The width of the human face, in fact, is well accommodated to their development, whilst that of animals is747 DERMOFDAL SYSTEM. badly calculated for that purpose. Thus, the eye of the brute, much more than the features is, the moveable interpreter of the different sen- sations, those of anger, hatred, jealousy, &c. The wrinkles of the human face, therefore, contribute very remarkably to the expression of the features, forming, in part, the science of physiognomy. The wrinkles of the scrotum are analogous to these, they depend upon the contraction of the subjacent cellular tissue, where but a few muscu- lar fibres exist. 2dly. There are other wrinkles also derived from motions, but in which the subjacent muscles take no part; I mean those of the sole of the foot, and more particularly of the palm of the hand. In these parts there are no subcutaneous muscles adhering to the skin, except the small palmar muscle, which does not interfere with these wrinkles. They are formed, in fact, by the habitual flexion, and hence several are observed over all the articulations of the phalanges. Three essential ones are observed in the palm of the hand, one at the basis of the thumb, produced by the motion of opposition, the other in the anterior part of the palm, from the flexion of the four last phalanges, which bend to meet the thumb, another in the middle of the palm. In the motion by which the hand is hollowed, the dermis bends between these depressed lines. A multiplicity of748 dermoidal system* other small wrinkles, corresponding to less fre- quent and less considerable motions, intersect them in divers angles. On the back of the hand and foot a number of wrinkles are observed on a level with all the articulations of the phalanges when they are extended. They disappear in flexion, and depend upon the looseness of the skin in this part, intended by nature to accommodate motion. Similar folds are observed over the greatest number of the articulations, but they are less striking, because the skin is not quite so firmly attached to the adjacent parts. Over the whole trunk, arm, forearms, thighs, and legs, no other depressions are seen, but such as correspond to the muscular projections, &c. 3dly. There is a third species of wrinkles, or rather of cutaneous impressions, but which are not very obvious: they are met with particularly in the sole of the foot and in the palm of the hand, and are very distinct from the preceding; I mean those which trace the papillae; scarcely any thing similar is met with in the trunk. 4thly. There are wrinkles belonging to age which are quite of a different nature. The sub- cutaneous fat having partly disappeared, the skin is left too wide for the parts it has to cover ; now as it has been deprived by age of its contractility of tissue, it will no longer contract, but wrinkles in various ways. Thus, in such parts as are more749 dehmoidal system. abundantly provided with fat, as the face for instance, these wrinkles are more striking; they resemble those found on the abdomen by repeated pregnancies, by ascites, &c. If in young subjects emaciation suddenly takes place, there are no wrinkles left on the skin re-assuming its primitive state. SECTION II. Internal Surface of the Dermoiclal System. This surface every where corresponds to the cellular tissue, which is loose over the trunk, thighs, arms, &c., condensed in the cranium, hands, &c. In most animals a fleshy layer, termed panniculus, and similar in form to that which in man is nearly in every part beneath the mucous system, separates the skin from all the other parts, and gives to it a variety of motions. In man, the dermoidal system still leaves here and there some signs of this internal muscle, as may be observed in the occipito frontalis, and in the major part of the muscles of the face. Nature has not provided the trunk nor the limbs with any thing similar to this, &c. Man is, in this re- spect, as far inferior to most of the animals as he is superior to that part of the creation, by the man- ner in which the muscles of his face are disposed. Whilst in man every passion is expressed by his750 DERMOIDAL SYSTIiM. features, whilst the exterior of the trunk remains peaceable and calm during these tempests of the soul, in animals the whole habit is convulsed ; the lion raises his mane, the horse shudders, the exterior of the body of animals is variously con- vulsed. By viewing an animal from behind, we may easily ascertain if he is calm, or agitated with passion ; only cover the human face, and the curtain is instantly dropped over this mirror of the soul: hence the people of all nations leave it bare. Physiognomy, in this respect, is as it were more generally disseminated in animals provided with a fleshy panniculus. Besides the cellular tissue, the dermis in the trunk is nearly every where super-jacent to muscles; but it does not interfere with their motions, nor is it sensibly influenc^W them. In the limbs it is separated from these ^organs byrfteahydayeijs, by an aponeurotic canvas. A multiplicity of vessels wind under this membrane; large veins are visible through its tissue; innumerable arterial ramifications twine upon its surface, and a number of nerves glide between them.751 DERMOIDAL, SYSTEM. ARTICLE II. Organization of the System of the Dermis. SECTION i. Tissue proper to that Organization. In this tissue are included, 1st. the corium ; 2dly, what is called the rete mucosum ; 3dly, the papillae. The corium forms the essential part of the dermis; from it this organ receives both thickness and form. The rete mucosum seems little distinct from it; from it also the papillae originate, but are rather more visible. / The Corium. The thickness of the corium is remarkably variable: 1st. In the head, those of the skull and face are quite the reverse of each other. The first is remarkably thick, and also dense and tight; it is indebted for these two properties to the quan- tity of hair it is crossed with, every where fine and delicate ; the second is particularly fine over the eyelids and lips. 2ndly. The corium of the trunk posteriorly, and all along the back, is nearly twice as thick as on the anterior part, where it isDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 752 nearly the same in the neck, chest, and abdomen, excepting however the penis, the scrotum, the labia pudendi, and the breast, where it is much thinner than on any other part of the body. 3dly, In the shoulder, arm, and forearm, the corium is nearly uniform, but it is somewhat thicker in the palm than on the back of the hand. 4thly, This thickness is in general much more striking in the thigh, and where there are more muscles to be contained, than in the arm or forearm. In the foot it is also thinner on the upper part than in the sole, where it is thicker than in any other part of the body. Hence we perceive, that al- though every where continuous, the corium varies in this respect in different parts ; and how far the thickness and functions of this organ are con- nected, is easily felt in the hand, foot, and cranium, &c. In all other parts these distinctions are not quite so obvious. The corium is generally thinner in the female than in man; compared in every region, evident distinctions between the two sexes are observed, particularly in the breast, where it is much more delicate in women ; that of the labia pudendi is proportionally thicker than that of the scrotum. To conceive a correct idea of the intimate structure of the corium, its internal surface should first be properly examined after it has been mi- nutely separated from the adipose cellular tissue,753 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. to which it adheres more or less intimately. The differences existing according to the divers re- gions, are then more obvious. 1st. In the sole of the foot, and in the palm of the hand, a multiplicity of whitish fibres are ob- served, these fibres shining like the aponeurotic fibre, and originating from this internal surface, form a new layer over it, as it were ; they inter- weave in every direction, leaving between them, particularly towards the heel, a number of areolae, more or less extended, filled with'fat, gradually widening, and finally lost in the subcutaneous tissue, nearly in the same manner as the fibres of the brachial aponeurosis are insensibly lost in the adjacent cellular tissue. This explains why, on dissecting the integuments of the sole and of the palm, the complete separation of these fibres from the cellular tissue with which they are blended is attended with so much difficulty; it also shows why these surfaces are not possessed of that motion observed in the others. The density of the cellular tissue also comes in for its share in this arrangement essential to the functions of the feet and hands, which are intended to seize and grasp external bodies. 2dly. The dermis of the upper and lower ex- tremities, that of the back, neck, chest, abdomen, and even of the face, consequently nearly of the whole body, are distinct from the preceding; first, inasmuch as the fibres are much less distinct 3 c VOL. II.754 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. then, by their not being lost in the cellular tis- sue, nor blended with it, as it were ; whence re- sults a remarkable laxity in the skin of those parts, and the astonishing facility it affords in dissection ; and finally, by the areolae being more contracted. These areola© display a multiplicity of apertures scattered near together, the major part of which contain small lumps of fat con- nected with the adjacent cellular tissue, and leav- ing, when removed, evident vacancies. The fibres that compose them are sufficiently con- tracted together to induce us to believe, on a cursory glance, that it resembles a sieve spread under the skin. In the hand and the foot, on the contrary, especially towards the heel, it forms a real net, the meshes of which present more sur- face than the fibres by which they are formed. Here it is quite the reverse. Let this be as it may, these areolae of the internal surface of the corium are remarkably useful in tanning, by which process this tissue, on account of these in- numerable openings, is more readily premeated on the fleshy side than in the opposite one. I have ascertained this fact in the human corium, which I had got tanned for the purpose. Chaptal has properly observed, that the epidermis was actually an obstacle to the process of tanning, and that for this purpose it is necessary to remove this covering, since it suffers the skin to be per- meated on both sides; but even then it is moreDKKMOIDAL SYSTEM. 755 readily penetrated on the fleshy than on the op- posite side ; 3dly. These innumerable apertures are not observed on the internal surface of the corium in the back of the hand and foot; it is smooth, whitish, particularly after a few days maceration. It is the same in respect to the skin of the scrotum, prepuce, and even of the labia pudendi; their tissue is much tighter, and no interstices are left; so that, although it is much thinner than that of the limbs and of the trunk, it contains nearly as much substance. In respect to the corium corresponding to the hair and beard, nothing more is to be seen than the open- ings giving a passage to the hair, very distinct from those I was mentioning just now, which are in the shape of a bag, and do not completely perforate the corium. Here then are three very distinct modifications observed in the internal surface of the corium of the dermis. The first and last are found in a few parts only, whilst the second is almost general, admitting merely of a few distinctions in the trunk, limbs, and head. These differences, how- ever, do not imply a variety in the nature, but singly in the form. Stretched out and fibrous in the first, the tissue of the dermis draws nearer and is somewhat condensed in the second, and by that condensation the areolae are made less dis- tinct. But there is a very simple way of obtain- ing a proper investigation, except in such parts 3 c 2756 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. as those in which they cannot possibly be traced ; it is by maceration. This is even the best way to obtain a correct view of the dermoidal tex- ture. In fact, when the skin has remained in the water for some time, it softens, the fibres of its corium separate, and their interstices become more distinct; then the areolae are not only met with in the internal surface, but they are seen extended throughout its tissue, which really re- presents a sieve-like body in its whole thickness, so excessively numerous are the interstices left between the fibres. These areolae do not assume a bag-like form towards the external surface; they open upon their surface by a multiplicity of apertures, very apparent when the skin has macerated for a month or two, but which in the natural state are hardly perceptible in some subjects, and very distinct in others. Besides, to investigate them, requires that the epidermis be removed. Now since to effect this instantly, we generally make use of boiling water, or of a quick fire, the tissue of the dermis shrinks, and they are thus made much less ap- parent, whilst on the contrary the skin is not contracted by maceration, but dilated and ex- panded, by which means the apertures are most evidently displayed. In certain parts, and in par- ticular subjects, they will admit of the head of a pin being introduced; in others they are less striking. They never cross the dermis in a per-DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 75? pendicular direction, but all of them obliquely on its surface ; so that a perpendicular pressure tends to make them collapse, by bringing their parietes together. Their termination cannot be better compared than with that of the ureters in the bladder. This explains why the hair it is crossed by is never straight, but in an oblique direction with the skin. It is wrong to say the hair is inserted obliquely, its insertion in the bulb is straight, it is in crossing the corium that its direction is changed. These apertures are not vessels, they are merely communications from the interior to the exterior, crossed by the hair, the exhalents, the absorbents, the blood vessels, and the nerves, resorting to the surface of the dermis: in the same manner the sub- jacent areolae are nothing more than cellulae, con- taining the vessels of the glands and of the cellular tissue. The tissue of the dermis should then be con- ceived as a real net, as a kind of cellular tissue, in which the cellulae, considerably developed on the internal surface, are less so on the external with which they communicate, to transmit to it diffe- rent organs. The corium then is, if I may be al- lowed to express myself thus, the frame, the can- vas of the cutaneous organ. It is intended to harbour in its areolae every other part which con- tributes to the structure of that organ ; it also concurs in giving them their intended form, but is wholly unconnected with them. What is the nature of this areolar tissue, whichDLHMOIDAL SYSTEM. 768 especially contributes to the composition of the cutaneous organ ? I believe it bears the utmost analogy with the tissue of the fibrous system ; the following lines contain the considerations in sup- port of this analogy : 1st. In the heel, where the tissue of the dermis assumes the fibrous form of the irregular ligaments, it would hardly be possi- ble to distinguish it from the other, so very uni- form is its external appearance ; it has the same resistance and density ; the very same sensation is felt on dividing it with the knife; 2dly. The tissue of the dermis, as the fibrous, is rendered yellowish and transparent by boiling ; 3dly. Like this also, it is gradually diffused into gelatine ; 4thly. Like this again it resists maceration for a considerable length of time; 6thly. Sometimes these two tissues are blended together; for in- stance, the annular ligaments of the wrist evi- dently send prolongations to the adjacent cel- lular tissue; Gthly. This tissue, like the fibrous, gives insertions to muscles: this is seen in the face, where several of the fibres of the orbicular muscles of the lips and eyelids, nearly all those of the eyebrows, borrow from the fibres of the der- moidal tissue real tendons. There is the same ar- rangement in the cutis of the palm. All these considerations prove, in the most con- spicuous manner, the connections between the fibrous and dermoidal tissues. Identity, however, is very far from existing between these two tis- sues. To be convinced of this, it will be enoughDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 759 to observe how much their mode of sensibility differs, how very different their diseases are : we might at first conclude, that in this twofold re- spect there was not the slightest analogy between them. The line of demarcation, however, is not near so real as might be supposed. In fact, the lively sensibility of the skin has not precisely its seat in that whitish tissue interwoven in such a manner as to leave between its meshes the spaces we have mentioned, and which are parti- cularly met with in the adherent surface of that organ. The experiment described, wdien speaking of the mucous system, wherein I have irritated the cutaneous organ froip within to without, evi- dently proves it. The surface containing the pa- pillae is particularly endowed with this vital pro- perty. It is proved besides, by pathological anatomy, that the internal surface of the dermis, where the tissue and the areolae we have spoken of are es- pecially found, is completely unconnected with almost every species of cutaneous eruption. This is quite certain in respect to the small-pox, the \tch, and a variety of tetters. I have also seen it in the vaccine pustules, in the miliary eruptions, &c. &c. It is fully ascertained, that in erysipelas, the external surface only of the corium is coloured by the blood the exhalents are gorged with. Thus the slightest pressure causing the blood to reflow, instantly produces a white spot,DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 760 which soon disappears when the blood is returned into the exhalents. This even especially distin- guishes the simple erysipelas from the phlegmon, wherein not only the external surface of the corium, but also its whole tissue and the subja- cent cellular membrane are inflamed. In measles, in scarlatina, in puerperal fever, the redness is most evidently only superficial. These pheno- mena coincide with those of injections. If they succeed ever so little with infants, the skin of the face, that of the other parts not quite so often, is almost completely blackened. Now this hue is much more evident in the external surface of the skin than in the internal part, and no doubt because the former contains more exhalents than the latter, which is merely crossed by the ar- terial trunks. The preceding considerations evidently prove that the areolar tissue of the internal surface of the corium, and even that of the anterior part, have much less vital activity than that of the external surface; that this tissue is unconnected with nearly every important phenomenon ot the skin, particularly with those which relate to sen-r- sation and circulation ; that the former belong to the papillae, and that the latter are seated in the rete mucosum : that it is left nearly in a passive state during almost all the active periods of that double portion of the dermis. The functions it is intended for, like those of the fibrous tissue, gene-761 dermoidal system. rally admit of this passive state ; these functions are limited to protect the body and screen it from mechanical injury. It forms our proper covering1. Hence it is possessed of properties perfectly calcu- lated for this use; it is excessively resistant; very considerable weights are required to rend slight straps of corium drawn in divers ways; it also requires considerable exertion to produce the same effect. This resistance, however, is much less than when the corium has been tanned : we know that thus prepared, that portion of the skin affords us the strongest ties of our manufactories. I know of but two tissues in the economy uniting so much suppleness with resistance. It is this and the fibrous ; and this is an additional assimilating cha- racter. We have seen that considerable weights were required to rend a tendon, a shred of aponeurosis, or a ligament taken from the corpse. The muscular, nervous, arterial, veinous, cellular tissues, &c. are much sooner parted, and if the tis- sue of the dermis admitted of less extensibility, it might, with much advantage, be substituted to tendons, ligaments, &c. in the structure of the body. Since the corium is a stranger to almost every sensitive and morbific phenomenon of the skin, let us then ascertain which are the parts of the der- mis that are the seat of these phenomena. These parts are very evident on the external surface ;DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 762 now on this external surface are found, 1st. What is called the rete mucosum ; 2dly. The papillae. Of the Rete Mucosum. A great number of authors have represented to themselves the rete mucosum as a kind of tunic applied to the external surface of the skin, between the corium and epidermis, containing an infinitude of apertures through which the papillae make their way. I cannot possibly conceive, for my part, how this fluid layer, according to the greatest number, when removed from the epider- mis, could be demonstrated. To see it, I have used a variety of means, but none succeeded. 1st. Such is the attachment of the epidermis with the skin, that in its uninjured state they can hardly be se- parated without injury to either: however, if effected with the utmost care and precaution, nothing of a mucous nature is seen on the de- nuded corium; 2dly. When longitudinally di- vided, particularly in the foot, where the corium is very thick, the limits that separate it from the latter are easily seen in the divided edge of a part of the skin, but nothing transudes from this di- viding line ; 3dly. When the epidermis is re- moved by boiling, nothing is left upon the inter- nal surface, nor upon the corium ; 4thly. Mace- ration and putrescency, particularly the latter, form upon the corium a kind of slimy coat at theDE K iVJOI DAL SYSTEM. 763 moment it is stripped of the epidermis; but this coat is evidently the produce of decomposition. Nothing similar to this is to be found in the natu- ral state. From all these considerations, it appears that there is no substance deposited by the vessels upon the surface of the corium, extravasated, and stag- nating upon this surface, and forming there a coat in the sense in which Malpighi had conceived it. I believe, that by rete mucosurn should be under- stood, a net of vessels excessively thin, the trunk of which, thin also, after having passed through the numerous pores with which the corium is perforated, to ramify upon its surface, and contain different kinds of fluids. The existence of this vascular net is obviously proved by liquid injections, which completely change the hue of the skin outwards, without in- fluencing it much interiorly. It is this which, as I have observed, is essentially the seat of the numerous eruptions, the greater part of which are actually unconnected with the cutaneous corium. The rete mucosurn then, may be conceived as a general capillary system, enveloping the cu- taneous organ, and forming, in common with the papillae, a layer interposed between the corium and the epidermis. In most subjects this system contains nothing more than white fluids. In ne- groes these fluids are black ; they are of an inter- mediate hue in dark coloured people ; and howDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. , 764 astonishingly these shades vary in others is sufficiently known. Hence the colouring of the skin nearly resembles that of the hair, which evidently depends upon the substance that exists in their capillary ducts; it is analogous to that of those spots from birth, commonly called moles, and in which a coat of extravasated fluids is never found between the epidermis and the corium. I believe, besides, we are yet but little acquainted with that substance which fills a part of the exterior capillary system. It does not cir- culate, but appears to stagnate until replaced by another. On examining the skin of a negro it is found black, and that is all. In maceration I have observed that this layer is sometimes removed with the epidermis, that at other times it remains attached to the corium. It is certainly uncon- nected with either, since both are of the same hue in white and in black subjects. When removed, it is never formed again. Cicatrices are white throughout the human species. Are white subjects provided with a whitish substance, which, stagnating in the exterior ca- pillary system, corresponds to that of negroes, or does the colour of their skin only proceed from the epidermis and the corium ? I am rather in- clined to think that white men are also provided with a colouring substance, since the long conti- nued action of a powerful sun evidently tans them. This circumstance has even led to a belief,765 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. that white is the natural colour of the whole hu- man species, and that there was one primitive race that has degenerated from variety of cli- mate. But to ascertain the diversity of races, it will be sufficient to observe ; 1st. That the colour of the skin is only one of the distinguishing characters of each species, and that several others are con- stantly superadded to it. The nature and form of the hair, the thickness of the lips and nose, the width of the forehead, the degree of inclination of the angle of the face, the whole aspect of the features, &c. are permanent attributes indicating a general modification in the organization, and by no means an isolated difference in the system of the dermis; 2dly. White men acquire a dark complexion in hot climates, but never the very colour of the natives. In their early infancy sent to cold climates, born in those climates, blacks remain such for ever, their colour hardly under- goes any alteration after a succession of many generations; 4thly. The complexion is very far indeed from following precisely the climate. In- numerable varieties are observed amongst people inhabiting the same latitude, &c. Every thing concurs to prove that the colour of the skin is nothing more than an isolated property of the different human species, although it is that which is the most conspicuous ; and no more im- portance should be added to it than to a number766 DE KM 01 DAL SYSTEM. of others which are drawn from the stature, some- times very low, as that of the Laplanders; from the wide and flat face, as the Chinese, from the dimensions of the chest, pelvis, limbs, &c. It is from general distinctions that the lines of demar- cation that separate the species should be drawn, and not from those of an isolated part. The European forms and features are in general the type with which we compare the outward ap- pearance of the inhabitants of other nations. The beauty or deformity of the human races, are, from our ideas, measured by the greater or less distance that separates them from ours. Such, in fact, is the power of habit with us, that we seldom judge in an abstract manner, and in pro- portion as an object is farther removed from what constantly strikes our sight it appears dis- agreeable to us, sometimes even insupportable. The colouring matter, besides, of the rete mu- cosum, affords more interest to the naturalist than to the physician. What ought to fix parti- cularly the attention of the latter, is the portion of the capillary system exterior to the skin where- in fluids are circulated. In fact, besides the part that contains the seat of colour, there is evidently one habitually supplied with white fluids, in which they circulate with more or less rapidity, incessantly succeeding each other. It is from this portion the exhalant pores, from which perspira- tion flows, originate ; it is this vascular layer that767 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. is the seat of erysipelas, and of every other cu- taneous eruption unconnected with the corium. It is not permeated with blood in the natural state, but a variety of courses may at every mo- ment cause it to be permeated with that fluid. If the skin be rubbed briskly it becomes red; if a stimulant be applied to it, whether this be me- chanical, or it consists of the small appendices of the plant penetrating the epidermis, or that it excites a chemical action, as in frictions with am- monia, or as when apart of the skin is held very close to a brisk fire, &c. the sensibility of this vascular net is instantly excited ; the blood pre- viously repelled is attracted to the part, which reddens in proportion to the extent of the ir- ritation. By powerful passions the cheeks are suddenly flushed, and every external application also affords proofs of the excessive tendency the superficial capillary system of the dermis has to become connected, if ever so little ex- cited, with the blood foreign to it in the na- tural state. Blisters act upou the same principle. The first effect, is to fill with blood the cutaneous capillary system wherever they are applied, sub- sequently to produce an abundant exhalation of serum under the epidermis. A few hours only are required for their producing the effect which in erysipelas requires a succession of days, for we know they most generally terminate by vesicles or phlycteenae over the skin. In burns that areDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 708 not sufficiently severe to produce contraction, there is also a sudden increase of exhalation be- neath the epidermis. The formation of the ve- sicle is constantly preceded by an inflammation of the external surface of the skin. This pheno- menon is not peculiar to this system. We have seen the serous, instantly on being denuded and irritated in some degree, redden in a short space of time by the passage of the blood into its ex- halents, constituting an inflammation, to which frequently succeeds an abundant exhalation of milky serum. This exhaled fluid does not stag- nate upon its surface, and forms no phlyctsense, because it has no epidermis. This is the only dif- ference in a phenomenon which at first sight does not appear to be the same in the serous and cutaneous systems. It is not only the irritation of the cutaneous organ that attracts the blood to the exterior ca- pillary system. Whenever the heart is strongly agitated, so that this viscus accelerates the course of this fluid, it is determined to these organs. This is evident; 1st. After violent running ; 2dly. During the hot stage of a fever, &c. In this respect I will make a remark that to me appears very important; it is that the capillary system of the face is much more liable than that of all other parts of the skin, to be permeated with blood ; 1st. This is obvious in the two cases I have just mentioned, wherein the action of the heait769 DERMOJDAL SYSTEM, is increased ; 2dly. In passions the skin remains the same in all other parts, whilst this suddenly flushes or turns pale ; 3dly. We know that the physician frequently consults the state of the capillary sys- tem of the face, because it is most generally influ- enced by that of the internal viscera ; that it is filled with or void of blood, accordingly as it is sympathetically affected; 4thly. In the various kinds of asphyxia, particularly in those proceed- ing from submersion, from the vapour of char- coal, from strangulation, &c. The face is con- stantly purple from the passage of the dark blood in its exterior capillary system to which it is conveyed through the arteries. Frequently even the neck and the upper part of the chest are livid, but the lower parts are never coloured; 5thly. In many diseases wherein death is caused by a kind of asphyxia, because the lungs are the first obstructed, the appearance of the face in the corpse is purple and tumefied. Those who attend dissecting rooms, have sufficient opportu- nities of making this observation. In a hundred subjects, this livid appearance in the superior parts will be observed to five in the inferior; 6thly. In the greatest number of apoplexies, the face becomes livid. From what does this remarkable susceptibility of the capillary system of the face to admit of blood proceed ? I believe three essential causes give rise to it; 1st. The way is already open, since the colour of the cheeks proclaims its pre-dermoidal system. 770 sence ; its quantity only is increased, whilst when- ever another part of the skin is flushed, the blood it contains is nearly accidental; 2dly. The ana- tomical arrangement of the capillary system is better accommodated there than in other parts to this influx of the blood, for it appears that there is a more ready communication between this system and the arteries of the corium. This is proved by injections, in which the face colours with the utmost facility. There is not an anato- mist, I dare say, who has not occasionally been struck with this phenomenon, in infants particu- larly, in which, if the coarse injections of our dissecting rooms pass but very imperfectly, the face becomes quite black, whilst very little fluid penetrates the other parts of the cutaneous system ; Sdly. It appears that there is a quicker sensibi- lity in the face : in fact, the stimulant w7hich attracts the blood to that part does not act with the same force elsewhere; for instance, a blow upon the ear will redden the cheeks more than a similar blow applied to the arms, &c. The blood is withdrawn from the capillary system of the face with the same rapidity as it flows to it; in the space of a moment passions will alternately impress upon the features both the fiery complexion of a fever, the paleness of syncopy, and also every intermediate shade. It is the facility with which this fluid penetrates those parts that colours b’le living picture, as it were, in which the divers passions alternatelyDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 3 d 2 rn tinge the features with a thousand different shades, which fade away, return, change, are modified, &c. according to the state of the mind. I have observed in this respect, that the face affords to our passions three means of expression ; 1st. The capillary system, perfectly independent of the will, and which often betrays what we en- deavour to conceal; 2dly. The muscular mo- tions, which, by contracting or expanding the features, express melancholy and grief, or joy and happiness, and from which proceed the differ- ent wrinkles we have mentioned ; 3dly. The state of the eye, an organ which, as Buffon has remark- ed, not only receives the sensations, but also ex- presses the passions. The two latter circumstances are in some measure voluntary, at least we may feign them, whilst we could not be deceived by the first. Anger, joy, &c. are expressed upon the stage, because these passions may be imitated by frowning, by laughing, &c. But it is the rouge by which the actress represents modesty and innocence ; let it be wiped off, and the pale- ness of fear and terror, &c. instantly appears. I shall add another essential observation in re- spect to the capillary system of the face, which is, that its tendency to be overrun with blood dis- poses it to become more frequently the seat of a multiplicity of affections, &c. We know ; 1st. That erysipelas is more frequently detected inI 7^3 DEKM01DAL SYSTEM. this part than in any other; 2dly. It is the prin- cipal seat of the pustule in small-pox; 3dly. A multiplicity of eruptions occur there in prefer- ence to any other part, &c. From all that has been stated, it is evident that we might thus distinguish two portions in the ca- pillary system exterior to the corium ; 1st. The one is habitually filled with the colouring sub- stance of the skin, a substance that, like that of hair, appears to be stationary, let the description be what it may, &c. which is liable only to the slow and imperceptible progress of composition and decomposition, and in which that sudden in- crease and diminution we have noticed are never observed ; 2dly. The other is habitually overrun with a variety of fluids incessantly succeeding each other, and uninterruptedly exhaled by per- spiration, which may however be replaced by the blood invading that part of the capillary system. These two portions are completely independent of each other, and probably there is even no kind of communication between them. It appears that at the moment of death, there remains a certain quantity of white fluids in the latter portion of the exterior capillary system ; it is proved by the following experiment which I have repeatedly made ; by dipping a piece of skin in boiling water, and suffering it to remain there a few moments, the epidermis rises, not wholly as in blistering, but in the form of numerous773 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. small vesicles or phlyctaenee, which instantly form on its surface, and contain a serous fluid that flows the moment these vesicles are opened. Papillce. By the papillae are meant small projections which rise upon the surface of the corium, and which perforating’ the capillary net we have just noticed, become by their extremities contiguous to the epidermis ; these projections are very strik- ing in the palm of the hand and in the sole of the foot, where they assume a regular arrange- ment in the form of small curved striae following different directions. They appear through the epidermis thick, as it is in those parts; but are particularly striking whenever this has been re- moved either by maceration or ebullition, &c.; on dividing longitudinally a piece of the corium of the foot, adhering to its epidermis, between these two, and all along the divided edge, a line de- scribing a twining thread is observed, resulting from the minute projections situate next to each other. In several other parts of the skin the papillae are rather obvious, but in many parts, on remov- ing the epidermis, nothing more than a surface, made uneven by a few small prominences, is ob- served, particularly towards the orifices crossed by the hair and vessels ; this is not possessed of774 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. projections set in a regular order, and is without any papillae properly so called. The multiplicity of very striking projections which make the skin of several subjects remark- ably rough, should not be mistaken for papillae. These projections consist of small cellular, vascu- lar or nervous lumps, or sebaceous glands, &c. situate close to the small apertures through which the corium opens under the epidermis, and which commonly transmit the hair. These lumps are contained within the small oblique tubes which terminate in the apertures by elevating the exter- nal covering, and thus project outwardly. The following is a very curious experiment, which evi- dently proves this arrangement. After the skin has macerated for two or three months, and even less, on the one hand, these small lumps, which generally contain a little fat, are converted into that whitish, thick, and mucous matter, similar to spermaceti, into which fat, after a long conti- nued abode in water, is constantly converted ; on the other hand the apertures widening, as we have seen, and the skin diffusing into a kind of pulp, it may easily be removed from these small projections, and they are seen continued with the fat that fills the meshes of the subjacent corium, and which is also converted into a solid sub- stance. That these cellular lumps contain vessels I have proved by injections, and of late I have also fur-775 DER1MOIDAL SYSTEM. ther convinced myself of it, by dissecting some scorbutic subjects, in which the spots began to form on the top of these prominences, with small ecchymoses similar to the bites of a flea. Thepe" tectriee of adynamic fevers bear a different aspect; but they also proceed from an extravasation of blood in the cellular tissue, in the small pores which open on the exterior surface of the corium to give a passage to the vessels, to the hair, &c.; the more prominent the small bodies just men- tioned the rougher the skin. They are in ge- neral more frequently met with in the limbs and back, than on the anterior surface of the trunk. The limbs contain a larger quantity of them in the parts of extension than in those of flexion. We conceive by a fine skin, one in which the corium is smooth on its external surface, and where these tubercles are not to be met with. This last arrangement is in general more observ- able in females than in men. Very frequently the epidermis with which these projections are covered, will exfoliate on a level with them, particularly from strong friction, which contri- butes so much the more to make the skin uneven, hard and rough, wherever they exist, and might even lead to a belief that they are formed of the epidermis, which in every in- stance is merely accessory. Wherever the epidermis is very thick, as in the palms of the hand and soles of the feet, if does not admitDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 77 6 of being elevated, and these small cutaneous tubercles are never observed ; very few are found in the face, in which an infinitude of vessels from within cross through the small pores we have mentioned. The papillas disseminated between these prominences are in general very obvious wherever they exist. Anatomists have ascribed to the latter a nervous structure; they consider these projections as the termination of the nerves that resort to the skin, and which, according to their idea, expand to form them after having previously been stripped of their outward sheath. Some even pretend to have followed the filaments as far as in the body of the papillae. I must confess I could never suc- ceed in this. In the natural state, the density of the corium in common with the excessive te- nuity of the filaments with which it is crossed are strong obstacles. After long continued ma- ceration, when the corium is reduced to a pulpy state, and consequently when these filaments might be traced, none can possibly be seen. I do not, however, pretend to deny the structure ascribed to these forms. The quick sensibility the skin is possessed of, seems even to admit of it; but this is analogy, and by no means a demonstra- tion. In fact, all other senses, the organs of which are endowed with such exquisite sensibi- lity, have all their portion which receive the impression from bodies continuous with nerves.DEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. 777 The Action of various Bodies upon the Tissue of the Dermis. In almost every other texture we have consk dered this action in the corpse only, because, during- life, all these tissues are removed from external forms, and they cannot be influenced by them. Here it may be viewed in a twofold re. spect, sincedhe skin is incessantly, we may say, in contact with nearly every form in nature. The Action of Light. Light evidently acts upon the dermis in the same manner as plants. Let us only compare the inhabitants of towns, constantly shaded from the burning sun, with the rustic incessantly exposed to its influence, and we shall find the difference. It appears that the effect I have mentioned is produced by light and not by caloric ; for indivi- duals living in a warm temperature, but who are screened from the solar light, will become fair as those who inhabit cold climates. Thus we know that some men who seldom leave their heated rooms, are fairer than others, who living in a colder atmosphere, are constantly exposed to the sun. Were we to remain for ever in a bath equal in temperature to the hottest season, the skin would not blacken. Schools and chambersDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 778 heated by stoves, in which people remain the same length of time, do not darken the skin. An indisputable proof besides, is, that cloths which do not prevent the action of caloric, and only in- tercept the rays of light, prevent the change of colour which takes place in all other parts under the immediate influence of light, as in the face, hands, &c. I am not alluding to the solar influ- ence over the vital powers of the skin, in such cases as those in which a coup de soleil produces erysipelas, or as when light is used as a remedy to recall life in a part it had forsaken. I can only consider its action in what relates to the tissue of the dermis. The Action of Caloric. The action of caloric upon the skin displays, during life, very different phenomena, according to the degree in which it is applied. 1st. A warm atmosphere expands the tissue of the dermis, increases its action, and causes the major part of the fluids that are the residue of nutrition and digestion, to be evacuated through the exhalents. 2dly. Drawn and contracted by cold, this tis- sue refuses to admit of these fluids, which are then chiefly expelled with the urine. 3dly. The functions are not disturbed by the gradual transition from one of these states to theDEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. 779 other. When this transition is abrupt, most ge- nerally different organs are deranged, because the fluids intended to be expelled, cannot possibly vary with the same rapidity in their direction towards such and such an organ, as the cutaneous excitement produced by the abrupt transition from heat to cold. 4thly. The skin resists degrees of temperature much better than that of the body ; it opposes an insurmountable obstacle to external caloric, which tends to form the equipoise as well in living bodies as in inert forms. Thus whilst these are impreg- nated with this fluid in an atmosphere superior to their own, they soon acquire the same degree of temperature, however much the surrounding air is superior to their own. The interesting experi- ments of the English physicians have in respect to the human species cleared this of all doubts. It is needless to repeat the particulars of the experi- ments in which mercury has been seen to sink in the barometer when the ball was placed in the mouth, and the skin to cover itself, in a stove, with the aqueous vapours of the air condensed by the proportional cold of the body upon its surface, &c.: the considerations respecting animals pos- sessed of cold blood, living in warm climates, prove the very same thing. I shall remark in this respect, that most reptiles, the temperature of which is much colder than that of the mam- maliae and birds, and which consequently ap-DEUMOJDAL SYSTEM. 780 proach more that of winter, cannot bear it. They become torpid in subterranean holes, the heat of which, like that of cellars, remains nearly the same, and awake only when stimulated by the milder temperature of spring. 5thly. In very cold climates, the skin on the other hand appears to form an obstacle to all sudden escape of caloric from the interior, to bring the body in equipoise with the surrounding atmosphere. This is obvious in the polar regions. Here, however, I must make a remark which is quite the reverse of the preceding. It is that the cetaceous species swim in those very seas, the temperature of which is the most reverse of theirs. The whale is chiefly killed in high latitudes, in Greenland, Spitzbergen, &c. How can it be ac- counted for then, that this fish, possessed of red warm blood, sports in those frozen regions, whilst our amphibious species, possessed of cold blood only, eagerly seek the scorching heat of the sun ? I do not know. It should be remarked, that the major part of the interior organs, on being laid bare in wounds, do not possess so completely as the skin, the fa- culty of retaining an independent temperature. As long as they remain healthy, the degree of temperature is much more rapidly increased or diminished. This phenomenon is obvious in the protruded gut during the operation for hernia, in muscles that are exposed, &c, &c. Thus in order781 deumoidal system. that in such cases these organs may possess the faculty of assuming an independent temperature, they inflame, and by this means they constantly retain their degree of heat, let that of the sur- rounding air be what it may. Next to the skin, the mucous surfaces are the most capable of re- sisting temperature, as is proved in cases of pro- lapsus, ani, &c. This distinction of the different systems probably proceeds from that of their structure, 6thly. Whenever the degree of caloric is ex- cessive it begins to act upon the skin, and its effects are the more remarkable in proportion to its intensity; 1st. The least of its effects is an evident redness, a kind of erysipelas. Caloric in such cases operates like friction ; 2dly. The se- cond is to inflame the skin, and subsequently to produce blisters. The third actually produces contraction, a kind of wrinkling in the fibres of the corium, which shrink, as those of all animal tissues, on being exposed to a high degree of caloric ; 4thly. By the fourth and last effect the tissue of the dermis is burnt, blackened, and ac- tually reduced to charcoal. These different de- grees of burning, merely proceed from the equally different degrees of caloric. I have remarked, that in these two first effects this fluid only acts i upon the vital powers, consequently can be pro- duced during life only. The two latter on the contrary, merely operate upon the tissue of782 13 E U M Ol DAL S Y S T E M. the organ. Thus will they as completely take place subsequently to death as previous to it. Thus contraction is often resorted to in the culinary art, to give to the skin a hardness and brittleness, in rendering certain meats more palatable. 7th. Cold, if very intense, will also act upon the cutaneous organ, and produce different effects according to its degree of intensity. The first is rather similar to that of caloric as first stated. It consists in a kind of local inflamma- tion. The end of the nose, the ears, and fingers, the cheeks, &c. are flushed in very sharp weather. I have not studied minutely the other effects se- parating this from the last of all, which is sudden death: but there is this distinction between gan- grene thus produced, and that proceeding from a high degree of caloric, that in this the black hue manifests itself suddenly, whilst in the other it is consecutive only. Let us remark in fact, that in gangrene there are two states that physicians do not sufficiently consider ; 1st. Mortification of the part; 2dly. Its putrescency. Putrescency is without exception preceded by mortification ; a multiplicity of different causes will produce it; sometimes it is the ligature of an artery, as in aneurism, on other occasions it is that of a nerve; frequently considerable inflammation is the cause, as sometimes it proceeds from contusion, attri- tion, or from a bruize, &c. As soon as any part of a living* body dies, let the cause be what itDERMOIDAi, SYSTEM. 78,1 may, it undergoes the process of putrefaction in the very same manner as the subject completely deprived of life. Its progress even is then much more rapid, owing, on the one hand, to the natu- ral heat of the body, and on the other to the moisture of the surrounding parts rendering it much more rapid. This putrescency varies ac- cording to the state of the part at the time of death. If overrun with a considerable quantity of blood, as when the vital spark is extinguished by inflammation, putrescency assumes a very rapid course, the part suddenly blackens, and a most offensive sanious matter is discharged ; it is then termed humid. If a small quantity of blood only be contained in the part at the moment of death, the progress of putrescency is retarded ; at first it putrefies, subsequently blackens, and a small quantity of the sanious matter only flows from the part. This is the dry gangrene. Thus if any part of a corpse be somewhat gorged with blood, as the head in apoplectic subjects, its pu- trefaction is much more rapid and humid than that of other parts which contained less blood. In the gangrene proceeding from cold, a dry- ness of the part is frequently observed, because it hardly contained any blood at the moment of death. How ignorant many physicians prove themselves to be of the proceedings of nature, by the use they make of their antiseptics, which they indiscriminately apply both to the living body?784 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. and to the parts which life has forsaken. Anti- septics are applied either to prevent the death of the part or to obviate putrefaction ; 1st. If for the first purpose the choice of antiseptics should be varied, loosen the ligature which had previ- ously been applied in the artery of an animal, and it will be an antiseptic operation. Bleeding, the use of diluent applications intended to dimi- nish the intensity of inflammation in phlegmon, are antiseptics. Tonics, such as wine for in- stance, all stimulants in short, calculated to rouse the vital powers reduced in a part in consequence of mechanical injury, are antiseptics, &c. It then follows that this term is misapplied in re- spect to medicaments intended to prevent the mor- tification of the parts. If antiseptics be used to prevent a dead part surrounded by healthy parts from becoming putrid, some effect may be ob- tained from such applications. Thus, by sprink- ling a portion of the skin, the end of the nose, &c. with the pulverized bark, muriate of soda, or any neutral salt, or by moistening these parts with the gastric juices, we may stop the progress of putrefaction as in a corpse, by using the same means. But what is the result ? Rather less foetor, and in the adjacent part, rather less propensity for their receiving the influence of the emanations from the dead part; but ulti- mately this must fall; antiseptics never can re- store it to life. Hence it is obvious, that suchDK R MOIDAL SYSTEM. 78.5 means should be considered in two points of view perfectly distinct from each other. Some will pre- vent mortification, and they vary in an astonish- ing degree, although they all tend to prevent the same effect. Thus our means of curing retention of urine vary considerably, and are even quite re- versed according to the cause of the retention. The other antiseptics prevent putrefaction with- out restoring life to the parts. These remain in- variably the same, whatever may have caused the death of the part. The Action of Air. Air incessantly acts upon the cutaneous organ, producing in the natural state an habitual evapo- ration of the perspiration it is covered with. Four- croy, who has given to the evaporation of the perspired fluid by air a particular attention, ap- pears to me to have extended rather too far the influence of such evaporation. This function, in fact, contains two very distinct actions ; 1st. That of the exhalents, which convey outwardly the fluid ; 2dly. That of air, by which the fluid is dissolved and fully evaporated. The first of these actions is in no way connected with the other. Let the exhaled fluid be dissolved or not, a further supply still flows from the exhalents; if not eva- porated, the fluid accumulates over the skin, which remains moist, but will not obstruct the VOL. II. 3 E786 DCHMOIUAL SYSTEM. exhalent pores, nor prevent a new supply from being superadded. A comparison will render this striking. The serous fluids are in the natural state incessantly exhaled and absorbed; in respect to these, the absorbents fulfil the very same func- tions as air does in regard to the perspiration by which it is absorbed. Now although the func- tions of these organs are interrupted as in drop- sies, the exhalents still continue to act; the only result is, an accumulation of serum which, al- though it stagnates over the orifice of the ex- halents, does not prevent them from pouring out serum as usual. However much urine the bladder may contain, if this fluid be even extended to the very mouth of the ureters, these tubes will still continue to pour out their fluids. Although the mucous juices stagnate over their respective sur- faces, new juices are still conveyed to these sur- faces in the same manner; although the skin re- mains damp by the non-evaporation of the per- spired fluid, the perspiration is not less continued. Evaporation is a physical process, perfectly un- connected with exhalation, which is a vital phe- nomenon. Perspiration is effected in a bath in the same manner as in the open air. The only dif- ference consists in the fluid mixing with the water instead of being evaporated. The humidity of the skin proceeds from two causes perfectly distinct from each other; 1st. From an increase of fluid flowing from the cu-787 ■ORRMOIDAL SYSTEM. taneoas organs, which increase of action may it- self proceed from three causes. First, every thing that may tend to accelerate the motion of the heart, as running, acute fevers, &c. will augment the perspiration : in the second place, whatever tends to slacken and expand the cutaneous organ by any direct action of the surrounding bodies over it, will also stimulate the exhalents ; as the excessive heat of a hot summer's day, a warm bath, and the, effect of a hot stove subsequent to it, &c. ; the action of the skin is sympatheti- cally increased in a variety of cases. Here rank in turn the hectic perspirations that proceed from the state of the lungs ; those caused by terror pro- ceeding from an epigastric organ being suddenly affected; those caused by a variety of acute diseases, &c. Now, in all these cases, let the evapo- ration by air be ever so active, the skin will re- main moist, because more fluid has been exhaled than the air can possibly take up. Thus in the catarrhs of the lungs, in which a greater quantity of mucous juices shower over the bronchia than can be evaporated, cough and expectoration are substituted to expel the surplus. 2dly. There are instances of the moisture of the skin arising solely from deficient evaporation* This is observed in the warmth of the bed when the air is not renewed, in damp weather, &c. In all such cases the exhaled fluid is not increased 5 but the quantity commonly emitted is made more 3 e 2788 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. observable by the deficiency of evaporation. It is in this point of view that the action of air upon the cutaneous organ in a state of perspira- tion should be considered* It borrows nothing from that organ ; it has not the slightest effect upon it, but merely dissolves the fluid rejected by its exhalents. Evaporation is an effect purely accidental, it can only take place after exhala- tion, with which it is in no way connected. In the course of the very same day in*which tempe- rature has undergone no change, the skin will often be dry, moist, wet, and covered with per- spiration. If air act upon perspiration, it is by contracting or relaxing the exhalents, and not by. taking up their expelled fluid. If the skin, like the serous surfaces, formed an imperforated sac, perspiration would be effected either with or without the contact of air. In fact, why should it not be the same thing in respect to the skin, as in what relates to these surfaces ? If the action of air upon the skin be studied in the corpse,- it will be obvious that it produces two distinct effects, according to the state of the subject. If with a free access on all sides, it will dry it, and then this organ, as well as the fibrous organs, assume a transparent aspect, unless it was impregnated with blood at the moment of death, in which case it turns black, or assumes a dark brown aspect. Thus dried; 1st. It is firm and re- sistant, and admits of being bent in every direc-DEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. 789 tion, without rupture, as is the case with a num- ber of tissues that have undergone desiccation, such as the cartilaginous, the muscular, <fec. &c. 2dly. It is not so readily changed, as the greater part of other tissues emitting the same quantity of fluid ; 3dly. It resists moisture much longer than the latter, although on being immersed for some time in water, it gradually re-assumes its primitive hue, and loses its transparency; 4thly. It does not exhale any offensive smell, as a number of other tissues. Hence the skins of a number of animals merely dried answer a variety of purposes, savages use them as garments, &c. Aponeuroses, mucous, serous, and fibrous mem- branes, could not thus be turned to advantage. To this again must also be referred the perfect state of preservation of the interior parts of mum- mies, which could never have stood a succession of centuries, had a fleshy or serous layer, &c. been the envelopment. Whenever the skin is left on the corpse, or ex- posed to damp air, instead of drying, it putrefies; then it assumes a tarnished hue and subsequently a greenish appearance, and finally exhibits a black- ish aspect. Its effluvia is very offensive ; it swells and thickens from the gases that form in it inflating the cellular tissue of its areolae. A mucous layer spreads all over its external ointment which divests itself of the epidermis; nothing similar to this is ever observed on theDEUMOIDAL SYSTEM. 790 internal surface. Finally, as soon as all the fluids it contained have been evaporated, a blackish residue, very different from that produced by combustion, remains. The Action of Water. This action in the state of life, relates either to the substances that are deposited on the surface of the skin, or to the cutaneous organ itself. The perspiration incessantly deposits upon the -epidermis a variety of substances, the principles of which are absorbed by the air ; but a number of which do not readily admit of being thus dis- solved ; such as the salts, for instance, remain upon its surface, and adhere to it when not removed by friction. Blended with the unctuous humours that transude from this surface with the different fo- reign particles which the air deposits upon the sur- face, these substances form an ointment over the skin, which does not, like perspiration, admit of being evaporated. Now this is washed off by water, and hence it is that bathing is a natural custom. All quadrupeds take the water, birds even frequently bathe, independent of those for whom it might be considered as the natural ele- ment. All human races observed till this day, frequently bathe in rivers, lakes, ponds, &c. on the banks of which they have settled. Animals inhabit in preference such parts as are well sup- plied with water; they desert those where the fluid is wanting, or contains just enough to quench791 DEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. their thirst. Every thing then in social life is perverted ; amongst us, numerous classes are hardly ever seen to use the bath ; and in these classes cutaneous diseases are most generally met with. We have already remarked, that the mu- cous juices, by remaining too long upon their surfaces, irritate, stimulate them, and subject them \ to be variously affected ; should we be surprised then, if the residue of the cutaneous exhalation will occasion alterations in the skin ? Bathing is more necessary in summer, because numerous ex- cretions being effected through the skin, a larger quantity of substance is deposited over it.. In winter every thing is carried off with the urine, the cutaneous surface being clearer, it does not require the same attention. Subsequent to long diseases, attended with abundant cutaneous eva- , cuations, a couple of baths will effectually com- plete the treatment. Water then should be con- sidered as an auxiliary agent to air in its action upon the skin', in removing from its surface such substances as could not be dissolved by the other ; substances varying in an astonishing de- gree, such as those of which the urine is com- posed, in which the chemist has found the fluid of perspiration, sometimes alkaline, at other times acid, frequently saline, and sometimes headed * with fragrant substances, &c. Water is the ge- neral vehicle ; on being evaporated, it leaves ex- posed such substances as will not, like this fluid,DEKMOIDAL system. 792 admit of being volatilized. In this respect dry frictions also prove useful, they keep the external surface of the body clean. We are but imperfectly acquainted with the manner in which bathing acts upon the cutaneous texture during life. In medical language it is said to relax, to soften, and render it pliant, vague expressions, uncalculated to convey any correct and precise ideas, and borrowed, no doubt, from the sudden softening the skin of a corpse (even tanned leather) undergoes on being immersed in water. Bathing operates upon the vital powers of the skin, it either rouses or diminishes them, as I shall explain, but it leaves its tissue in the same state, and, as we shall find, only changes that of the epidermis. Macerated in a moderate degree of tempera- ture, in that of cellars, for instance, which never varies, the human skin softens, hardly swells, be- comes evidently whiter, and remains a consider- able time in that state without undergoing any further alteration, except a degree of putrescency much inferior to that of the muscular, glandular, or the mucous tissues, &c. undergoing the same process. This degree of putrescency by which the epidermis is destroyed, is better observable on the side of this membrane ; after macerating for the space of two months, the skin has hardly lost any thing at all of its consistence. At this epoch reduced to a pulpy state similar to that ofDEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. 793 macerated tendons, muscles, &c. three or four months are required before it begins to be diffused into a fetid pulp. I have some that were macerated upwards of eight months since, yet still retain their primitive form, but diffuse under the finger being slightly pressed. In a semi-putrelaginous state, the skin still retains the faculty of twisting when submitted to the action of caloric ; it twines on burning upon coals, or when immersed in boiling water. It loses this property whenever it is reduced into a putrelage. Submitted to ebul- lition, the tissue of the dermis, when completely clear of cellular tissue, produces less froth than is obtained from the muscular, glandular, and mucous tissues ; in this respect it has some resem- blance to the tendons, owing undoubtedly to its being almost entirely of a gelatinous nature, and thus containing but a scanty portion of albumine, slightly contracting before ebullition commences, it twists on its own axis, by which the side of the epidermis becomes uniformly convex, and the opposite surface concave; what follows will ac- count for it. The fibres of the corium being drawn nearer together by the act of contraction, are compressed ; the areola? they contain disap- pear ; but these areolae being very spacious in the part opposed to the corium, it naturally follows that the tissue of the dermis becomes very nar- row in this direction, whilst the other surface hardly containing any areolae at all, forming, as794 DERM01DAL SYSTEM. / it were, a solid body: the fibres, for want of space, cannot so easily contract, they are left extended, and the surface remains wider. In the natural state, the spaces formed by the areolae being filled with cellular tissue, increase the width of the internal surface : these spaces having then disappeared, this surface necessarily becomes nar- rower. The moment this kind of tortion is effected in the skin, a multiplicity of phlyctaense, as I have said, filled with serum, and originating from the epidermis, form over it. This membrane being remarkably thick in the sole of the foot and palm of the hand, they cannot form in those parts, and nothing similar to phlyctsenae is ever detected. However, on removing it from boiled feet, I have observed it contained a number of 'small vesicles hardly discernible. I have not analyzed the water contained in the phlyctaense ; it must be similar, I conceive, to that drawn by blistering. A greater or less quantity also flows from these vesicles, which are consequently more or less spa- cious according to the state of the external capil- lary system at the moment of death. By shrinking the skin becomes harder, elastic remarkably resistant; thicker, and of course nar- rower, and soon after assumes a semi-transparent appearance and yellowish hue, like other fibrous organs that have been boiled. Then the hardness acquired by contracting gradually fades away; itdlkmoidal system. 795 becomes soft, the water in which it was boiled is found to contain a considerable quantity of gluten, but the membrane, however, is not reduced in bulk, it is even considerably thicker. All kinds of fibres, areolee, or appearance of organization, has in this state completely disappeared, nothing remains but a membranous mass apparently ho- mogeneous, semi-transparent, and of a gelatinous nature. In this state it still retains the mucous, serous, cellular tissues, &c. the elasticity it had acquired by contracting, and remains possessed of that property through the redundant quantity of gelatine it still contains. The slightest motion impressed upon it causes a general quivering, a kind of vibration in all its parts, perfectly similar to that of calves’ feet jelly. Finally, if ebullition be still continued, nearly the whole of the gelatine is dissolved, and nothing left but a membranous residue as it were, and which will not diffuse without great difficulty. Common boiling water even will require a consi- derable length of time to reduce the skin to this state. Such are the phenomena which I have observed the human skin to undergo in boiling. Chemists have made the tissue of the dermis of several other animals the particular object of their enquiries; they have formed to themselves various ideas of its nature; they have admitted of two substances, the one fibrous, the other gela- tinous. I shall refer the reader to their books796 DEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. on this head, to those particularly of Seguin and Fourcroy, as I have made it a general rule never to relate what has previously been described to avoid needless repetitions. The Action of Acids, Alkalies, and other Substances. The sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids, act upon the skin when put in contact with it, as upon all other animal substances; I have re- marked, however, their action is much slower in its progress, particularly on the surface covered with the epidermis, even although this membrane had been previously removed. The first of these agents will easily reduce it into a blackish pulp, the others even, if highly concentrated, require more time to bring it to that state ; oxygenated muriatic acids have very little power over it. Several authors have stated in their books, that the application of caustic to the corpse will pro- duce the very same phenomena as in the living subject. I have placed several fragments of this substance in a piece of skin; I inclosed it with a knot, so as to keep them in permanent contact with the epidermis; after a space of twenty-four hours* I found these fragments dissolved by the humi- dity they had absorbed into a yellowish red pulp. Shrunk and contracted, the tissue had not been perforated, nor even did its exterior surface ap-ORR M0IDA1. SYSTEM. 797 pear at all decomposed. Alkalies in general ap- pear to act quite differently during life, and even their action seems to vary according to the diffe- rent degrees of vitality. Flabby and fungous parts are not, as is well known, so easily burnt as quick and living parts ; the very same thing is observed in respect to acids. During life they never produce any thing similar to that pulp, va- rying in colour according to the agent used, and which after death is the invariable result of their action. It is well known that a solution of alkali, in contact with the skin, will produce, as is ascer- tained by the touch, a kind of unctuous and greasy substance, proceeding, no doubt, from a combi- nation of the alkali with the oily fluid of the skin, from which a kind of soapy substance is formed. I shall omit speaking of the remarkable ten- dency the dermis has to combine itself with tannin, and of the phenomena resulting from such combination, it would only be repeating what has already been stated on this head. I shall merely remark, that it might be an object of some importance to admit the extensive sub- cutaneous aponeuroses to this process, the tissue of which being essentially of a gelatinous nature, has the utmost analogy with that of the dermis, and which, considering their extent and tenuity, might probably be converted into uses for which798 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. to the tanned skin could not be so well adapted. It is well known, that the tanned skin is no longer what it was in the natural state, and that it bor- rows from the substance with which it is impreg- nated an artificial degree of consistence. If com- bined with any considerable quantity of tan, it loses entirely the power of contracting and is liable to crack; whilst if only slightly impreg- nated with this acid, it retains its suppleness in some degree, as well as its contractile powers, if sub- mitted to the action of fire. I compare a tanned skin to a bone impregnated with its phosphate of lime; and a skin that has not undergone this pre- paration, I compare to the cartilaginous paren- chyma deprived of phosphate. , SECTION i. Parts common to the Organization of the Dermoidal System. Cellular Tissue. Every part of the dermis contains a redund- ant quantity of this tissue, wherein it is arranged as follows: a multiplicity of projecting threads shoot from the uppermost surface of the sub- cutaneous cellular layer, penetrate into the areolae that are contiguous to the corium, of course plunge into those situate more externally, and, finally, terminate in the innumerable poresDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 799 which transmit the vessels, nerves, and the hair, after they have crossed this portion of the cellular tissue. The corium then may be considered as a kind of spongy body, the interstices of which are formed by the areolae, and every part containing cellular tissue, in such a manner, that if it were possible to separate these areolae by dissection from the cellular tissue and other organs they are over-run with, a substance perforated in every direction might be obtained: in the performing which, art is likely to fail, considering the ex- cessive tenuity of the parts; but often where dissection fails, nature frequently succeeds. I have ascertained that in cases of furunculus, every thing that filled the interstices of the fibres of the dermis was expelled by suppuration, and that these fibres removed besides from each other by the swelling of the parts, actually displayed wThen cleaned of the fluid with which they are moist- ened,—that kind of perforated substance to which I allude. The furunculus, in fact, differs from a multiplicity of other cutaneous eruptions, inas- much as it seizes upon the cellular tissue of the areolae of the corium, whilst the latter are ex- clusively seated, as I have said, in the reticulated portion. I have not heard of any acute affection invading the corium itself, all, without exception, attack either its surface, or the cellular tissue of its areolae.

In cases of elephantiasis, I have detected the complete disorganization of this tex- ture. Thillaye has submitted to my inspection por- tions of the skin dug out of the cemetery, in which every thing filling the areolae of the dermis had entirely disappeared, and wherein the areolae and their dried fibres actually formed a kind of membraneous sponge, admitting light in every direction. This instance proved quite the re- verse of what is observed subsequent to long con- tinued maceration, in which the adipose cellular texture, converted into a solid and whitish sub- stance, retains, as I have already stated, the form of the areolae, while the fibres of the dermis, re- duced to a pulpy state, were easily removed. In the first instance the mould only was preserved, in the second it was the contained substance only. In leucophlegmatia of long standing, the sub- cutaneous serum, infiltrating by degrees, through the cellular projections of the areolae of the der- mis, distends their fibres and consequently increases their capacity, and pften extends as far as the epidermis, which gives way in several parts, and through the crevices of which the serum escapes. In this instance, the skin is not dissolved as has been asserted, into cellular tissue, but distention exists between the fibres of the dermis which are not detsroyed.801 HER MO IDA L SYSTEM. I do not think that the cellular tissue of the corium extends under the epidermis as far as its external surface, for when this is removed granu- lations do not form; yet from all parts pos- sessed of cellular tissue granulations shoot the moment they are exposed. Blood-vessels. Arteries twine in the subcutaneous cellular tissue and project an infinitude of small branches, which penetrate with the cellular organ into the re- motest areolae of the dermis; subsequently they insinuate themselves into the adjacent cells, draw nearer to each other in twining, and anasto- mose in a thousand different ways, cross the areolae of the external surface of the corium, and finally give rise to that external capillary net which has been described in speaking of the rete mucosum, and wherein hardly any red blood is admitted, even in the natural state. In this track of the arteries through the areolee, the der- mis is supplied with a few branches only between the fibres of the corium, as is exemplified by the most minute injections. These fibres in this respect resemble those of the aponeurosis, that are intersected by a profusion of vessels, but can claim but few belonging to their tissue., The veins pursue nearly the same course as the arteries, but in a reverse sense. After crossing the areolee of the dermis and the cellular tissue 3 f VOL. II.802 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. it contains, they unite into large subcutaneous trunks, which overrun a long track, forming, as we have seen, a system perfectly distinct by its situation from that of the arteries, .and are often observable through the integuments. Imper- ceptible in the natural state the veinous ramifica- tions of the areolae are considerably dilated by subjacent cancerous tumours, and make the skin these tumours are covered with appear striped with blue lines, which increase in proportion as the tumour grows. Whenever a considerable distention of the cutaneous organ is caused by aneurism, pregnancy, dropsies, &c. this dilatation also takes place, provided however that the cause of distention has assumed a chronic type; for nothing similar to this is ever observed in acute affections, let the swelling be what it may, as in tumefactions proceeding from fractures, com- plicated luxations, &c. All the dark blood formed in the skin resorts to the general veinous system ; no part of it be- longs to the abdominal circulation. Nerves, The nerves follow nearly the same order as the blood vessels. Numerous and rather con- siderable branches, such as several divisions of the musculo-cutaneous, internal cutaneous lombar, saphenae, anterior tibial, intercostal, cervical nerves, &c., contribute to form a kind of803 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. subcutaneous nervous system, from which pass all the branches that penetrate the dermis. These branches in crossing with the arteries and veins the areolae of the dermis, and seemingly forming numerous anastomoses, insinuate themselves into the pores which open into the internal areolae, and undoubtedly terminate in giving origin to the papillae. It should ever be remarked that the hand, wherein the papillae are remarkably conspi- cuous, contains in proportion to its surface a much greater quantity of - subcutaneous nerves than any other part of the body. Absorbents. An innumerable quantity of absorbents twine under the skin : in this part, even they are more readily investigated ; every vein is surrounded with them ; several clusters of these tubes are found in their interstices, so that a layer com- posed of absorbents disposed in a continuous membrane, seems in the limbs to separate the fasciae from the skin. It cannot be doubted but the greater part of these vessels originate in the corium, and that they convey to the blood both fat and cellular lymph, as well as the materials intended for the nutrition of its fibres. But is there a peculiar order of branches, open- ing at the surface of the epidermis, and intended to absorb in certain cases heterogeneous sub- stances ? Anatomical inspection fails in resolving 3 f 2804 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. this question, but the following are considerations which appear to me to illustrate it. 1st. The subcutaneous absorbents, obviously demonstrated by injections, are proportionally too numerous to be merely intended to convey fat and serum from the neighbouring parts. 2ndly. A variety of medicated substances evidently appear to be absorbed: such are, mercury in venereal diseases, divers purgatives, emetics, even febrifuges, as peruvian bark, which being used by friction, have produced their effects as effectually as if they had been taken inwardly ; cantharides, which frequently act upon the kidneys when the tincture is used as a liniment; narcotic substances, which sometimes cause heaviness in the head, and an irresistible inclination to sleep, when they have been applied externally, &c. We are very familiar with these divers effects, of which almost every author has quoted examples. 3rdly. The absorption of every description of virus is well known ; instances of those of hydro- phobia, variola, of the vipers, &c. being absorbed, might be produced ; an absorption effected with difficulty only, it is true, by the uninjured epidermis, but infallible on its being removed ; the matter brought in contact with the ex- ternal capillary net we have already described. I have even remarked that the various methods employed to inoculate, vaccinate, &c. prove in- disputably both the existence and importance80 5 PEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. of this part, to which until now sufficient consider- ation has not been paid. The epidermis absorbs a variety of contagious principles. Such are those of the plague conveyed by the clothes, and of the different pestilential fevers, which penetrate through the skin more readily than they are transmitted by respiration. I think that the cutaneous absorptions conveying diseases might be arranged in the following order— £ 1st, Local; as in the itch, porrigo, Sec. See. Sec. 1st. Absorptions from the shin, -/‘hidly. General; as in pestilential dis- J eases, putrid fevers, caught in an v unhealthy residence, &c. Sec. Sec. 1st,Local; as in vaccination, inocu- lation of the small pox, &.&c. Sec. 2ndly. General, as in hydrophobia, the venom of vipers, wounds inflict- ed with an instrument envenomed with putrid matter, cScc. &c. &c. In this appendix we find that the absorbents loaded with morbid substances, sometimes convey them no further than the part, and at other times transmit them to the blood, by which they are extended through every organ in the eco- nomy. Several authors have taken it for grant- ed, that in those cases wherein absorption was general, there are more nervous action and sym- pathetic phenomena than actual transmission of the morbid matter to the tide of the circulation ; consequently, that the solids act nearly an exclu 2ndly, Absorptions from in- jury to the epidermis.806 DERMOID A L SYSTEM. sive part in such diseases. But to remove the slight- est doubt in this respect, it is only necessary to ob- serve, 1st. That, in the absorption of a number of contagious substances, such, for instance, on wound- ing the finger with a scalpel envenomed with putrid matter, pain is felt, and even a red line is observed in the course of the absorbents in the arm, and that subsequent to this, the axillary glands are swollen ; 2dly. That by artificially in- troducing into the veins a part of such sub- stances as are used in frictions, similar effects to those produced by the latter mode are obtained. Thus, transfused or absorbed, purgatives and emetics will equally act, the former upon the in- testines, the latter upon the stomach. It appears to me that all possible advantage has not been drawn from the numerous experiments respecting transfusion, tried in the last century. On com- paring their effects with what takes place in the cutaneous organ, I consider it impossible to deny that in contagious diseases the blood contains a morbid principle. 3dly. Subsequent to the use of mercury by fric- tion, the effluvia of this metal, which is blended with every animal fluid, obviously acts upon silver when applied to the mouth, rectum, &c. I am even convinced that the blood, which in the natural state has little elfect upon this metal, would alter it in this case. Accoucheurs807 DEKM01DAL SYSTEM. are well aware that the liquor amnii from women who have undergone a course of mercurial fric- tions, presents this phenomenon. 4thly. Several substances unconnected with the materia medica are conveyed to the blood by cutaneous absorption. Water seems to mix with it through this means, in the rapid pro- gress of certain dropsies, and in several instances quoted by travellers, who, for the want of fresh water at sea, have partly quenched their thirst by wrapping themselves up in wet cloths, &c.; the garments are impregnated with oil of turpentine, the urine wdll soon assume an odour it borrows merely from the principles transmitted to the blood through absorption. Several noted physi- cians have found their weight increased after a morning’s walk. I have myself observed, that subsequent to un- remitting attendance in dissecting rooms, the air of the body had an offensive smell perfectly simi- lar to the effluvia arising from putrid subjects. To ascertain indisputably that the skin in such cases will absorb the odorous particles as effec- tually as the lungs, I adopted the following means: after having stopped up my nostrils, I applied to my mouth a long tube, the further end of it passing through a small opening in the win- dow ; I could thus breathe pure fresh air : now after having remained an hour in this situation in a very small dissecting room, and close to twoDERMOIDAL SVSTGitf. 808 subjects in a far advanced state of dissolution, the breath had nearly the same putrid smell as that arising from these bodies. I have also observed that a similar effect is produced by handling putrid matter. Of course, then, the absorbents trans- mit these effluvia to the blood, by which they are subsequently expelled through the mucous sur- faces of the intestines. Thus whenever urine is absorbed, the saliva, mucous juices, &c. borrow from that fluid a urinary smell. I might produce a multiplicity of further proofs in support of cutaneous absorption; but I have merely selected the most striking. Several more have been quoted, by Haller in particular, to whom I refer, as in his work he has accumulated innumerable instances. I have observed, however, that cutaneous ab- sorptions are characterized by a remarkable irre- gularity ; that apparently under the very same influence they sometimes take place, at other times they are not effected. Thus it is, that most generally,nothing is absorbed in the bath; that con- tagious principles are either taken in or rejected ; that vaccination succeeds or fails; and that ino- culation, &c. is sometimes very doubtful. Let us not wonder at this, the absorption of such and such a substance requires a determined degree of sensibility in the skin: above or below this de- gree the absorbents will reject the substance. Thus if by a purgative the natural degree of theDEUMOJDAL SYSTEM. 809 sensibility in the lacteal absorbents of the intes- tinal tube be increased, instantly, but moment- arily, their action is suspended ; they cease to ab- sorb fluids, chyle, &c. and the whole is expelled through the anus. Now, innumerable causes in- cessantly act upon the skin; a multiplicity of irritating agents alternately operating upon this organ, unremittingly vary its degree of organic sensibility ; they increase or diminish it, and thus remove from it that degree required to effect ab- sorption. Should we wonder, then, at the va- rieties this function is liable to ? Several modem authors have brought forth against it negative facts. What is proved by these facts, unless the very varieties in the degrees of sensibility I am alluding to ? But they do not by any means in- validate that sum of facts universally avowed, and the amount of which forms a mass of sub- stantial and irresistible proof. Thus have the vital powers of the mucous surfaces been found to vary, owing to the variety of their stimulating agents, and, of course, in effecting absorption. If in the serous membranes and cellular tissue, during the elaboration of the organs, tiffs function remains permanently the same, it is owing to its being always in contact with the same substances that the surfaces in which it is effected have retained an invariable degree of organic sensibility. Numerous facts, particularly relating to con- tagion, appear to prove that debility promotes810 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. cutaneuos absorptions. 1st. In infants and women; absorption is more active than in strong and vigorous men. 2dly. Several physicians have remarked that during night, when the cutaneous organ is, in one respect, left rather inactive, in- asmuch as it is not stimulated by exterior agents, contagious diseases are sooner caught. 3dly. I have myself noticed, that the greater number of students who have been taken ill in the course of their dissections, had removed to their chambers remnants of subjects, the effluvia of which they had absorbed during their sleep. 4thly. Practi- tioners, as is well known, strongly recommend to avoid contagious emanations during hunger, on account of the powers of the body being reduced by the emptiness of the stomach. Exhalents. These vessels seem to originate from the exte- rior capillary system that surrounds the corium, and invests the papillae in the same manner as the arteries of the areolae of the dermis terminate from this. The exhalents borrow their fluid, which they subsequently spread over the epider- mis. Their form, extent, course, and direction is not ascertained by anatomy; but their existence is unquestionably proved. 1st. By injections, which sometimes exceed the whole cutaneous surface. 2dly. By the vascular exhalation attendantI DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 811 upon some diseases, in which blood is actually respired. 3dly. By natural sweat and transpira- tion, which certainly could not possibly be effect- ed without this agency, although several authors i have admitted of pretended glands to separate these fluids. Calculations, ad infinitum, have been resorted to, in order to ascertain the quantity of fluids habitually shed by the cutaneous exhalents. We are terrified on reading the results obtained with much labour, by a number of philosophers on this head; on perusing the prodigiously extended calculations of Dodard, Sanctorius, Keil, Ro- binson, Rye, &c. To what have these enor- mous calculations conduced, for which the whole course of a single individual’s life would probably have proved too short, unless it were to convince us, that, whenever we start from an erroneous principle, the whole link of consequences deduced from it, notwithstanding that these consequences be rigorously deduced the one from the other, is false: the greater part, in fact, of these authors have consider- ed the skin as a kind of fountain, provided with multiplied capillary tubes, which in the same lapse of time pour out incessantly the same quantity of fluids, and admit, consequently, of being submitted as well as the inert capillary tubes that pour out fluids to approximations and calculations in respect to quantity. But the result of these calcu-DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 812 lations soon proved how far their authors had been deceived. If we but read these results we shall find that none agree, and that some- times very great differences exist amongst them. Should we wonder at it ? Innumerable causes incessantly concur to vary the quantity of the perspiration. The state of the constitution, exercise, rest, digestion, sleep, watching, passions, &c. will increase or diminish the action of the cutaneous exhalents. I am not speaking of the differences of climate, seasons, &c. which are still more effectual. It has been attempted, even lately, to ascertain what belongs to urine, what to perspiration, to pulmonary respiration, and to excretions, and to calculate what kind of connexion there is between the quantity of substances expelled: fruit- less and idle researches; admitting even that this could be ascertained in respect to one individual, it could not be applied to others. Has physiology or pathology derived any solid advantage, any judicious and solid application, from all these immense computations on perspiration ? What opinion should we entertain of a man who should pretend at the equinoctial period, when the state of the atmosphere changes almost every instant, to ascertain the proportions between the quantity of rain that falls every fifteen minutes; or of him, who would attempt to establish connections be- tween the quantity of fluid evaporated at certainDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 813 spaces of time from the surface of a vessel con- stantly submitted to variable degrees of ebullition? yet the comparison is correct. If the comparative weight of substances evapo- rated during a given time from the body might in general be estimated, even this would vary according to each individual; but to pretend to ascertain in a general manner, what in this com- mon mass of fluids is separately the produce of urine, or of perspiration, would be to show our total ignorance of the nature of the vital powers. We have already admitted, that all the know- ledge we possess respecting the variations in the quantities of perspiration are limited to a few ge- neral ideas ; that for instance, in cold climates and seasons, it is chiefly through the internal emunc- tories the residue of nutrition and digestion is expelled ; whilst in summer and hot climates the cutaneous organ is the principal agent. The skin, on the one part, the kidneys and pul- monary surface on the other, are in this respect always in a reverse state of activity. Physicians are very familiar with this difference in respect to the urine and perspiration ; they know that whenever the one is increased, the other is diminished; that during winter the former is loaded with a number of principles, and that in summer perspiration acquires a saline taste, and other particular characters, derived from814 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. substances which it did not contain in winter; but they have not made such accurate inquiries on the connection existing between transpiration and the sweat; this has induced me to try some experiments, which I shall relate. I was anxious to ascertain during summer, when the transpiration is abundant, and consequently when every heterogeneous principle transudes through the skin, the state of perspired matter. To collect this humour, which is exhaled by in- sensible evaporations, I dipped an empty bottle, perfectly cleaned and dried, in a pail filled with ice and muriate of soda, and breathed into it for a considerable time ; taking care not to drop the least particle of saliva. The parietes cooled by the exterior ice, condensed in small icicles, the vapour of my breath on the internal surface of the vessel. When I had collected a sufficient quantity, I immersed the bottle in warm water, by which the icicles wTere melted, and the residue of my respiration, previously a vapour, condensed into a liquid. In this experiment, two things parti- cularly struck me, namely : 1st. The very small quantity of fluid I had obtained, although I had breathed for the space of an hour, and then made two men do the same also an hour each ; 2dly. That the generality of re-agents had no effect whatever upon this fluid. Nitric, sulphuric, and muriatic acids, the lapis infernalis and alcohol, on being mixed with it produced no particular eflect. By submit"815 DERM01 DAL SYSTEM. ting a small quantity of it to evaporation in the concave surface of the glass of a watch, no residue was left : held in a spoon over the light of a wax taper, it underwent no alteration whatever from the effect of caloric. In a word, I was almost induced to believe it was nothing but water. I confess, however, that this experiment should be repeated with care. The small quantity of fluid obtained led me to think that the form of the vessel Was not suita- ble, as it did not present a sufficient surface, and that the vapour of the lungs was not sufficiently expanded. I therefore took the spiral cylinder of a small alembic ; I surrounded it with ice, caused a man to respire through it, and I obtained, in fact, rather more fluid, but infinitely less than than what I expected, considering the immense quantity of vapour observed to escape in winter from the mouth. In the space of an hour I could obtain but two ounces of fluid, which I have comparatively weighed with water, and which I found rather heavier than the latter; a certain proof that a few principles I am unacquainted with were blended with the aqueous part. I am convinced that in winter I could obtain a much greater quantity of condensed vapour. This is proved by the breathing of animals, as I have just stated. I am also convinced that, like urine, the humour of respiration is then loaded with principles which during summer816 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. escape through the skin. I must, however, con- fess, that this important point, which I intend to elucidate next winter, is unsupported by experi- mental observation; lam even inclined to believe that many coughs originate from it: in fact, a number of those principles rejected by the mucous surfaces of the bronchia, differing from their aqueous vehicle, and not being taken up by the air, stagnate upon these surfaces, irritate them, and produce the cough by which they are expelled. This accounts for the frequency of coughs in winter, as well as for the inclination to bathe, ex- perienced in summer, in consequence of the saline substances that are accumulated upon the skin by exhalation, being, as I have said before, insoluble in air. This also explains how, in a number of affections of the lungs, in which the mucous glands and the exhalents of the bronchia do not increase the quantity of fluid generally shed by these organs, but merely separate with this hu- mour, in consequence of the change of their or- ganic sensibility, substances in air cannot possibly dissolve. Thus I say it is explained how such af- fections are attended with habitual cough ; for, as I have already stated, the moment any sub- stance stagnates for some time upon the mucous system, it will irritate it, and stimulate the surface to rid itself of it. Such, in my opinion, is a sketch tending to elucidate the origin of several coughs, which, considering the insufficiency of817 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. expectoration, have been considered as nervous, and are nothing more than a means substituted by nature for the deficiency of evaporation. Physiologists, in my opinion, have not paid sufficient attention in examining either the bron- chia or the skin, to what is evaporated, and to that which remains. Certain animals^ seem to emit these insoluble principles in a greater portion than man; this is the reason why horses must be curried everyday, and frequently bathed, to clean the skin of matter that cannot be taken up by the air. Fourcroy and Vauquelin have ascertained that phosphate of lime is never found mixed with the urine of these quadrupeds. This sub- stance seems to transude through the skin, from whence it is removed by friction and by water. I do not altogether conceive how the hair could be considered as an emunctory in this instance, it appears to me much more natural to suppose, by analogy, that the matter escapes with perspiration. I consider that in the natural state rain is quite as necessary to animals as to plants, the first never shun it, several even readily meet it; with them it has the effect of a bath, it washes off the saline particles which air could not dissolve, and cleans the skin. The cutaneous exhalents do not seem to be everywhere equally distributed. The face and chest are liberally supplied, for perspiration is co- pious in these parts ; the back and limbs are more VOL. II. 3 G818 DE RMOIDAL SYSTEM. sparingly provided with them ; perspiration in« deed is rarely detected in the palms of the hands or in the soles of the feet. This, however, in some individuals, varies remarkably. I have seen two sisters from a family in which consump- tion was almost hereditary, whose chests were in every respect well formed, they never denoted the slightest symptom of pulmonary affection, and on being warm, perspired exclusively from the chest. In some individuals, as is well known, perspiration flows from the face, in others from the scalp. Is cutaneous exhalation at all influenced by the nerves? In numerous cases of paralysis, perspi- ration is as completely effected on the diseased side as on the sound one. Sometime ag'o I at- tended a patient of the Hotel Dieu, who, in con- sequence of an apoplexy, was affected with he- hemiplegia, by which the left side was entirely de- prived of motion, and yet perspiration was wholly confined to that side, so far even that a line of demarcation all along the median line might be readily traced; on one side the skin was left perfectly dry, on the other the whole was ex- cessively moist. I have heard of instances in which phenomena quite the reverse took place : but they cannot destroy the evidence of habitual observa- tion, of perspiration flowing both from the diseased and from the healthy part. Who besides is not aware that the nervous action being annihilated inDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 819 the paralyzed limb, serum is effused as effectually as before by the application of blisters ? Was ever the cutaneous exhalation increased by convulsions, by which nervous action is so much increased ? Will those states of exquisite sensibility, when every cutaneous nerve so readily admits of receiving every impression, in ever so slight a degree, ever influence perspiration ? Let us, then, acknowledge that, in what relates to cutaneous absorption as well as secretion, if any kind of nervous influence exist, we are completely unacquainted with the nature of it. Sebaceous Glands. Besides the imperceptible perspiration and sweat conveyed through the skin, this organ is habitually lubricated with an unctuous fluid. On leaving the bath, this fluid, floating, unmixed with the water, is observed to cover the skin with small drops of grease that stain the linen when it is applied to the skin, and which, together with the dust floating in the surrounding atmosphere, accumulates and retains together a variety of foreign substances, either received from without or expelled with perspiration. This humour is generally observed to be more abundant in blacks, whose skin is on this account disagreeable. The parts that contain the most, with respect to the latter, are those shaded with hair, and more particularly the cranium. If at all 3 g 2820 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. neglected, the hair becomes greasy, unctuous, and « shining : it appears even that this redundant trans- udation of unctuous substance was intended to preserve their suppleness ; thus art, in imitation of nature, generally employs greasy substances in dressing the hair. In other parts covered with hair, a less proportion of this fluid is met with ; scarcely any flows from the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, undoubtedly on account of the thickness of the epidermis. On washing the latter, the water is seen to collect, in small drops, from the back, but never on the opposite surfaces, which are easily and constantly bathed; these drops are never seen on the surfaces of the nails. This kind of cutaneous oil, collecting in several parts of the body, as in the armpit, perinasum, the wrinkles of the scrotum, &c. and, blended with certain prin- ciples arising from perspiration, sometimes exhales a. most offensive smell. Thus, this unctuous fluid, the nature of which we are but little acquainted with, is not, like per- spiration and fat, liable to any great increase or diminution, being, without exception, found nearly in the same proportional quantity. It appears to preserve the suppleness of the skin and prevent its cracking. The ancients used to anoint the whole body with oil, in imitation, no doubt, of this natural ointment. How very prevalent this custom was amongst the Romans is well known. Whence does this cutaneous oil proceed ? It831 DEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. may be produced in three different ways; 1st. Bv transudation; 2dly. By secretion; 3dly. By exhalation. Some have admitted, that the subcutaneous fat transudes through the pores; but the scrotum, in which this substance is entirely wanting, ranks first amongst the greasy parts. The skin of the cranium, excessively oily, hardly contains any fat at all. That part covering the cheeks which possesses abundance of fat, is scarcely lubricated by it, &c. In the emaciated subject, the skin is fre- quently as unctuous as in the corpulent one ; this, however, is not invariably the case. To conclude : it is obvious that, in all the other functions, fluids do not transude. Is this an exception? Those who pretend that the cutaneous oil is secreted, (and they form the majority) place its source in small glands which they term sebaceous, and which, in their opinion, are everywhere ex- tended under the skin. A few small tubercles are actually observed on the convexity of the ear, on the nose, &c., but in almost every other part nothing is observable; a few very small promi- nences only, which I have already mentioned, are seen, and cause the roughness of the skin, but they have nothing to do with these glands. I do not, however, pretend to deny that they exist, but I could never observe the slightest appearance of them in my repeated experiments. This induces me to believe that there is pro-DERMOIDAL SYSTEM, 822 bably an order of exhalents intended to separate this cutaneous fluid, an order distinct from that through which the fluid of perspiration flows. The cellular tissue, in fact, actually contains tubes that exhale fat and others that exhale serum. The fat is certainly not separated by glands, nor the mar- row, which is supplied by the exhalents of the medullary organ. It is, I think, quite as probable that this fluid is exhaled, as that it is secreted. Besides, this oil should not be confounded either with the ceruminous matter of certain glands on the edges of the eyelids, behind the ears, and which is expelled by pressure under the form of small worms, nor with that whitish matter which collects between the glands and the prepuce, evidently the produce of small glands. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Dermoidal System. SECTION i. Properties of the Tissue. These properties are very conspicuous in the skin; they are particularly displayed by those alternate transitions from a state of emaciation to that ot corpulence, which the body, particularly the limbs, are sometimes liable to, and by which they acquire a double and treble volume, and are againDJi RMOIDAL SYSTEM. 823 restored to their original dimensions. The various tumours, collections of matter, and external aneurisms, the sudden swellings attending con- siderable contusions, serous collections, pregnancy, schirrus, the numerous affections in which the volume of the testis is increased, hydrocele, &c., also proclaim these properties. In all such cases, the skin is seen, first, to extend and dilate, then to contract whenever the cause of dilatation has ceased, and finally, is restricted to the space originally allotted to it. From the contractility of tissue proceeds that remarkable separation observed in the edges of a wound from a cutting instrument. This phe- nomenon, which is also observable in the corpse, is a further proof of what has been often re- marked, namely, that the properties of the tissue exclusively belonging to the organic texture, are unconnected with the vital powers, from which they merely borrow additional energy. Thus, cutaneous retraction is found more effectual du- ring life, in a wound inflicted in either a longitu- dinal or transvere direction: but this increase of contractility borrowed from the vital powers, is particularly striking in amputation. No part whatever, not even the muscles, will ever contract as much as the skin, hence the care so strongly recommended in practice, to spare as much as possible on performing amputation ; hence also, the important additional modifications that haveDERM01 DAL SYSTEM. 824 been, introduced in the method used in former times. Muscular contraction is effected more rapidly, but this being more lasting eventually predominates; so that in the former mode of per- forming amputation, in which all the parts were cut on a level, the stump assumed a conical form, the bone forming the summit, then the muscles and arteries, &c. came in succession, and it was terminated towards the limb by the skin that formed the basis. There are many instances, however, in which the extensibility of the dermis is not so very con- siderable as might be thought. For instance, in large sarcoceles, the skin of the parts adjoining the scrotum being drawn, covers the tumour, and is substituted to the deficiency of extensibility of the skin in this part: that of the penis in par- ticular, is almost completely drawn to cover the tumour, so that the organ disappears. To the want of sufficient extensibility, the following phe- nomenon must also be referred :—in a wound attended with loss of substance, the granulations on contracting by the evacuation of the whitish humour they contain, draw the surrounding skin over the wound : in this case the skin is not merely extended, but actually moved. This ex- plains why, in those parts where the skin is naturally stretched, and adheres, it will not ad- mit of such locomotion, and cicatrization is ob- taihed with difficulty, as is instanced on the era-825 DEUMOIDAL SYSTEM. nium, sternum, &c.; why, on the contrary, in the scrotum, fold of the arm, the arm-pits, &c., it is so easily effected ; why, in dissecting tumours, it is so strongly recommended to spare the healthy integuments, &c. When the skin is extended, the fibres that form its areolse are separated from each other, and the capacity of these areolse is increased : their wfidth becomes particularly ob- vious on the internal surface of the dermis; for, as all the pores of the external surface perforate the tissue in an oblique direction, distention merely reduces the width of these small tubes without increasing their orifice : thus, whilst the internal surface discovers numerous and extensive inter- stices, this remains continuous, but discloses these interstices, by which it is made transparent wherever they exist; hence the marble-like appearance observed in the skin of the abdomen of women who have borne many children. When- ever the skin is drawn, the internal areolee con- tract, and are even obliterated. The external surface containing none, cannot possibly be so much reduced in the wddth, so that a dispropor- tion between the external and the internal sur- faces ensues; hence, as I have said before, the convexity assumed by the former on being im- mersed in boiling water ; hence also, the uneven- ness and external roughness caused by cold, which forces the dermis to contract. This phe- nomenon besides is never produced but when826 DEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. contraction takes place in the natural state ; for if preceded by distention, the cells first widen, then contract to their original size, and there exists no disproportion, in extent, between the external and internal surfaces of the skin. The generality of extensions are attended with a reduction in the thickness of the tissue of the dermis. Its thickness is never increased, and its density at the same time diminished, but when, as in leucophlegmatia, its areolae are infiltrated with water. In chronic inflammation, obstruction, and in various alterations that have their seat in the dermis, it is partly deprived of the faculty of extending, and is easily torn on being dis- tended. This is often the case in aneurisms, par- ticularly in those by which the sternum has been perforated: a slow and gradual inflammation invades the skin that covers the tumour, and it breaks from a degree of distention much less than what it can support in its natural state, if not prevented by death ; of this I have seen ' two instances at the Hotel Dieu. In this state of inflammation the distention is excessively pain- ful, whilst it is attended with no pain at all in the natural state. In the greater part of chronic affections that are seated in the skin, this organ is also deprived of its contractile powers. Is the skin more braced at one time than at another, when it is left looser and more ex-827 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM, pandecl ? I am led to believe it, from the observa- tion of the pits of small pox being evidently deeper at one time than at another. section ir. Vital Properties. The vital properties are very striking in this system. It might be thought that nature, by thus concentrating vitality in the envelopment it forms, intended to draw a striking line of demar- cation, and forcibly to impress upon us the dis- tinction that exists between the inert forms with which its external surface comes in contact, and the organized tissues invested by its internal sur- face. In studying the properties of this system, I shall adopt the order I have followed in the others: some belong to animal, others to organic life. Properties of Animal Life. > Animal sensibility is carried to the utmost de- gree in the skin. It presides in this organ over feeling, where it is much nicer and more delicate than in the generality of the other tissues. From this sensibility, touch also originates, a two-fold and very distinct function. Feeling is the faculty we are gifted with of being made sensible of the impression of sur-828 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. rounding forms. It conveys to us the sensa- tion of heat and cold, humidity and dryness, of hardness and softness, &c. Then it is connected, 1st. With existence. Sndly. With the general modification of exterior bodies. Its exercise al- ways precedes that of all the other senses, which can never be effected but in consequence of its action. It is indispensable to sight, hearing, smell, taste, as well as to touch ; it does not proceed from a particular modification of the animal sensi- bility, and is nothing more than this property observed in exercise. Thus whenever the special modification of that sensibility which presides over the other senses has been destroyed; when the eye is no longer sensible of light, the ear of sounds, the palate of flavours, the pituitary mem- brane of odours, these divers organs still retain the faculty of perceiving both the presence and the general properties of these bodies. Feeling is solely connected with the particular modifications of bodies. It is the source from which our notions respecting their exterior forms, volume, dimensions, directions, &c. arise, and differs essentially from the other senses. 1st. It does not necessarily require like touch any particular modification of sensibility. The hand may feel with rather more precision than any other part of the skin ; but the difference is not very considerable, and feeling' would be nearly as perfect if the skin investing the pelvis covered829 DERMOIBAL SYSTEM. the fingers. But all our senses, on the contrary, are individually gifted with a sensibility peculiar to them, and by which they are exclusively con- nected wTith some specified substance in nature. In vain would the pituitary membrane, extended like the retina in the socket of the eye, perceive the rays of light; or the membrane of the palate, if lining the fossae nasalis, perceive odours, &c. &c. 2ndly. We can only feel substances in the more common acceptation of the word; the other senses are called into action by the insensible and excessively multiplied particles of bodies, such as those of light, savours, &c. 3rdly. Most of the other senses do not require the previous interference of the will. Odours, light, sounds, will strike their respective organs, and convey, often quite unexpectedly, their re- spective sensations. It is the same in respect to sensation; the will is not often exercised. It is affected because we are surrounded with an infi- nitude of excitants, for in general they seek the causes of sensation ; it is these that reach and act upon us. The touch on the contrary most essen- tially requires being directed by an act of the will; its exercise is consecutive to that of all the other senses. It is because we have seen, heard, and smelt any object, that we feel it. By this we either confirm or rectify the notions con- veyed by the others. This shows why it isDERMOIDAL SYSTEM* 830 under their dependance as it were ; the more these are restricted, the less frequent is the other. The blind, the deaf, &c. are more inclined to feel than he, who having all his senses correct, leaves all the avenues of sensation open for the impression of external forms. 4thly. Most of our other senses require a pe- culiar structure as well as sensibility rn their respective organs. The touch, on the contrary, merely requires a special form in its organs. Provided these organs on the one part, be en- dowed with animal sensibility, and calculated on the other to grasp, and include in different points of contact, exterior forms, they are enabled to exercise their tactile qualities. The touch will be obtuse and imperfect if the contact be limited to one or two points only ; however it will still exist. Thus we touch with the arm-pit, folds of the arm, of the ham, with the lips, and tongue. Thus the elephant feels with its trunk ; reptiles in twining round different bodies; the majority of animals with the nose, &c.; but whenever the points of contact are more multiplied, the exercise of this faculty is more fully exercised. In this respect the human hand is admirably adapted for the purposes of touch : It proves that man is intended much more than other animals to communicate with surrounding bodies ; that the domain of his animal life is much further extended than theirs ;831 DERMOIDAE SYSTEM. that his sensations are more correct, because they are gifted with a means of perfection denied to other animals ; that his intellectual faculties take a more extended range since they are endowed with an organ so far superior to theirs, and bordering on perfection. The sensibility of the skin, as we have seen, essentially resides in the papillae ; in these all the important phenomena relative to sensation are effected. It is the part of the skin which in reality belongs to animal life, as the rete mucosum, on account of the vascular plexus it is formed of, is the portion essentially connected with organic life. The corium left, as it were, in a passive state, remains a perfect stranger to every function of any importance, and merely serves as an envelopment. The very lively sensibility of the papillae re- quires an envelopment to shield them from too strong depressions. This envelopment is the epidermis. As soon as it is removed, all kind of contact becomes painful; even the impression received from air—from this impression proceeds also that sensation of burning experienced when a blister is removed. It should be remarked, in fact, that this burning sensation is a very frequent consequence of the animal sensibility of the skin being raised beyond its usual type. This ex- pression is borrowed from actual burns, which, » when not exceeding a certain degree, act nearly832 DERM01DAL SYSTEM. like blisters, leaving the papillae exposed ; and, as it is always the skin that is exposed to the action of fire, we refer to every burnt organ the ideas attached to this expression. But pain is very far from being the same in the other systems. This exclusively belongs to that of the dermis; it is applicable to erysipelas, to burns, to blistering, 4&c., and to every inflammation that has its seat in the rete mucosum. This sensation is never felt in any other system undergoing inflamma- tion. In the cellular tissue, it is a pulsating pain, and, in the muscles, the seat of acute rheuma- tism, it has quite a different character, &c. There is another kind of pain also peculiar to the cutaneous system, I mean the sensation of itching ; it forms the first degree of burning. We remove it by gentle friction, which supersedes the first; but, when that new impression is lost, the preceding one, which is produced by a permanent cause, returns, and requires a renewed exertion. Then we have on a small scale what we observe on a larger, when any degree of pain is superseded by one more violent. In no system whatever of the economy is this kind of pain, so common in the itch, and in the numerous series of other cutaneous eruptions, ever felt. In their tubercular inflammations, the serous membranes become the seat of whitish eruptions, similar to many of those of the skin. The mucous sur- faces also, are often affected with a multiplicity ofms DERM01 DAL SYSTEM. 3 H VOL. II. small pimples, but in neither of these cases is this sensation ever felt. There is also a sensation which appears to be the first degree of pain, as that of burning is the last; I mean tickling, a kind of mixed sensation, a kind of hermaphrodite, as an author has termed it, pleasing, when not exceeding a certain degree, but painful when excessive. If the fingers be passed gently over a mucous,or serous surface, over a muscle, or a nerve, even when exposed, a similar sensation is never produced by the contact. The animal sensibility of the skin, like that of the mucous surfaces, is essentially submitted to the powerful influence of habit, by which what was painful at first gradually becomes indiffe- rent, or even pleasing;. We find in all that sur- rounds us constant proofs of this assertion : air, in the revolution of the seasons; caloric, in the innumerable variations of the atmosphere, in the abrupt transition from one temperature to another; water in the bath, in the damp vapours it sur- rounds us with ; our dresses, some of which, as those made of wool, are at first very annoying; every thing, inshort,that acts upon the skin, merely by simple contact, will produce sensations which habit incessantly tends to modify. Only consider the mode of dress in the inhabitants of different nations ; in some, the whole of the upper parts are left uncovered; in others, the fore arm only is left bare; in a third, the inferior limbs are whollyDEKM01DAL SYSTEM. 834 or partly naked; in a fourth, a more or less con- siderable portion of the trunk is exposed to the air; savages are entirely naked. Now, these se- veral parts, according to each people, are thus left bare, without conveying the least painful sensation from the contact of air; let the parts, on the contrary, that are habitually clothed, be ex- posed to this contact, a painful sensation, particu- larly if the wreather be cold, will at first be felt; by degrees, these parts become used to it, and that sensation is then no longer experienced. Of late, a general outcry has prevailed against Greek dresses, against the slightness of dress with the fair sex, &c.; I do not mean in respect to morals, but in what regards physiology. The only repre- hensible thing was, that the changes of sensibility could not accord with the rapid progress of the fashions. If the neck had been first uncovered, then, successively, a part of the chest, and then the breast, &c., this property would gradually have assumed, through habit, a new modification, and no accident would have occurred ; but in the sudden transition from a dress by which every part was covered, to another, leaving the supe- rior half of the trunk, either before or behind, almost entirely bare, should we be surprised to find, that colds and catarrhs, &c. wTere the in- * ' fallible consequences. Habit ha3 a powerful sway in respect to the sir in, even over our very morals; even decency, in this835 DE'RMOIDAL SYSTEM. respect, is only comparative. An Indian woman, who wears no other dress than a slight and nar- row piece of linen round her waist, would, among us be an object of scandal, repugnant to public chastity. Habit, in her own country, is her veil, and the only one required. A female savage, conveyed to this country, would be looked upon as a most indecent object ; in her own she was not so. Let us only follow our own fashions in their rapid successions : the same female, by not altering her dress, would, two years ago, have been considered as clad like a common prostitute, and would appear, this very day, in the garb of a prude. Indecency is that which shocks our habits. The Indian woman, with part of her body only covered* with a rag, is more decent than our females would be now by expos- ing a small part of the breast, according to their former dresses. The sight of the face is deemed most indecent in those countries where the women wear veils, <fcc. Let us then consider habit as the test of decency in dress. Nature requires, that in physiology, the phenomena over which she presides, should be gradually linked together ; the very same observation also obtains in respect to morals. A female, by the sudden change of a warm dress for a lighter, would ex- pose herself to painful sensations, to catarrhal affections, &c. and shock the eye accustomed to view her under a different appearance : but when- 3 h 2836 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. ever the change is insensibly and gradually brought on, there is nothing repugnant either to fashion or to health. Habit will not modify cutaneous sensibility, re- sulting from an alteration in the tissue, or from inflammation, &c. : considerably exalted in the latter states, it much exceeds its natural type, and the slightest contact becomes exceedingly painful. Then the impression conceived by feeling is im- paired, touch itself conveys no longer general sensations; one common and uniform impression only arises from the contact of any kind of form whatever, and this is pain. Sometimes the animal sensibility of the skin is lessened, and is even completely destroyed: this is exemplified in paralysis, although not so frequent as the loss of motion ; these affections, however, are not uncommon. Amongst the organs of our senses, the eye is generally the first to be impaired ; the ear ranks next, the skin in turn, then the nostrils, and finally the tongue, which of all the sensitive organs is the last to be affected, undoubtedly, because it is above all others connected with the preservation of organic life, without which we cannot exist. The others, especially, belong to animal life, of which we may be deprived without death being an infallible consequence. The sensibility of the skin is never destroyed through its whole extent. In this respect, even837 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. hemiplegia is seldom detected; sensationis extinct, but in an isolated part only. I have remarked that the existence of paralysis is an additional proof that nerves have not the slightest influence over cutaneous exhalation and capillary circula- tion, since these two functions, as I have said be- fore, as well as those attended with loss of motion, are regularly affected in such cases. When the nerves in the limb of an animal have been cut, to deprive that limb of motion, and subsequent to this operation an irritating agent is applied, the skin will inflame as usual. When animal sensibility is excited, are the pa- pillae in a state of erection, by which the sensa- tion is rendered more lively ? WThat has been said respecting the mucous surfaces may be ap- plied here. This erection is an ingenious idea of some physicians, and quite unsupported by obser- vation : examined through the magnifying glass, the papillae constantly appear to be in the same state. Why should not the skin be like a denuded nerve, like the eye, ear, &c., wherein these kind of erections have never been thought of. Animal contractility is entirely unconnected with the cutaneous organ, which only undergoes voluntary motion from the agency of the panni- culus carnosus. Properties of Organic Life. The cutaneous organ is endowed with organicDERMOIDAL system. 838 sensibility, and insensible contractility in the highest, degree. These properties, as I have said before, are especially seated in the exterior capillary system, forming the rete mucosum. They are unremittingly active to preside over, 1st, capil- lary circulation ; 2dly, exhalation ; 3dly, absorp- tion ; .4thly, the nutrition of the whole tissue of the dermis ; 5thly, the secretion of the cutaneous oil, if there be any such things in existence as subaceous glands. Connected thus with such a variety of functions, no wonder then, if these properties are so extensively developed in the skin : add to these considerations, the continued action of exterior forms, an action that keeps this organ as it were in an habitual state of irritation, constantly stimulating its sensibi- lity, and which action is to that sensibility what that of the substances contained within the mucous membranes is to the sensibility of these very membranes; the irritation even is more effec- * tual, because the exciting agents are more frequently renewed. Numberless substances, differing in density and composition, incessantly succeed each other on the exterior of the body, acting at the same time upon the animal sensibility of the skin, to form divers sensations; they stimulate the organic sensibility to effect those functions over which this sensibility presides. Should we be surprised then, if the major part of cutaneous affections, admit of alterations in839 DURMO 1 DAL SYSTEM. this property, as well as insensible organic con- tractility, which is never separated from it ? I divide these diseases into four classes, from the structure observed in the skin : — 1st. There are diseases belonging to the pa- pillae : such are palsies, and the increased sensibi- lity, which exclusively belong to the nerves. Females are particularly liable to the latter, which are so far extended in some nervous affec- tions, that a moderate pressure upon the skin will produce convulsions; to this also must be referred the excessive susceptibility observed in some in- dividuals, who on the slightest tickling expe- rience a general revolution. These elevations of animal sensibility, ought to be carefully distin- guished from those before stated, and which proceed from inflammation. In the latter, the organic sensibility is especially affected : one might think, that on being increased, it was con- verted into animal sensibility, whilst in the case I am alluding to, this last property only is increased. 2dly. There are diseases that are obviously seated in the cellular tissue of the areolae of the dermis: such are the inflammations of that por- tion of the cutaneous organ, by which a phlegmon, a furunculus, <fec., are covered. 3dly. Other affections belong to the exterior capillary net from which the exhalents originate. To this belong erysipelas, several species of erup- tions, measles, scarlatina, and a variety of other cutaneous affections daily met with in practice.DERMOiDAL SYSTEM. S40 4thly. To conclude, there are also diseases by which the corium is affected. Elephantiasis, and in general a number of chronic cutaneous diseases seem to me to rank amongst them : in acute diseases the corium even is apparently never affected in the first instance. The obscurity of its vital powers, its dense and light texture, its being almost destitute of blood vessels, will admit of chronic affections only. In phleg- monous erysipelas, in boils, &c., this organ is merely influenced, but not essentially diseased. Thus have we found every affection of the bony, cartilaginous, fibrous* fibro-cartilaginous systems, &c. especially assume a chronic type, owing to the texture and obscurity of the vital powers in these, systems. Now, if we reflect ever so little upon this divi- sion of cutaneous diseases, we shall find that, ex- cepting those of the first class, which are not very numerous, and consist in an increase or dimi- nution of the animal sensibility; we shall find, I say, that all the other affections consist in a more or less disordered state of organic sensibility, and corresponding insensible contractility. All de- rived from an increase, a diminution, or an altera- tion in these properties. To these various changes, also, must be referred the exuberance or deficiency of perspiration, the divers exudations effected through the skin ; in fact, the structure of the exhaients remain in- variably the same. W hv then do thev admit ofDERMOID A L SYSTEM. 841 a greater or less quantity of fluids ? why do they at certain times open a passage to substances, which on other occasions they will not admit ? It is be- cause their organic powers have undergone other modifications. These powers are very evidently reduced by diseases; they are left in a languid, a prostrate state. Blistering then is of no use ; or- ganic sensibility will no longer answer the applica- tion of stimulants. It is even a very striking phe- nomenon in irregular fevers, and an additional proof how completely independent of the cerebral nerves are all the phenomena of cutaneous exhala- tion and capillary circulation, &c. In effect, whilst during the fit the brain is in the highest degree of excitement, that by this excitation the volun- tary muscles are violently convulsed, that the whole animal life seems to have doubled its energy before it is extinct, the organic is already partly exhausted : the functions of that portion of the skin belonging to this life have already ceased. The degree of intensity of the stimulating agents of organic sensibility varies in an astonish- ing degree. 1st. The most powerful are fire, can- tharides, alkalies, acids sufficiently diluted in water, so as to act only upon the vital powers without contracting the tissue of the skin, the juices of a variety of plants of a sour nature, even certain fluids formed in the body, as those of cancers, &c. All these stimulants redden the skin on being ap- plied to it. 2dly. The greater part of these sti-842 DERM01 DAL SYSTEM. mulants, on being weakened will only slightly excite the skin. 3dly. And finally, aqueous fluids, poultices, fomentations, called emollients, seem least of all calculated to produce this excitement; they even rather weaken the cutaneous organic sensibility ; they act upon it as a sedative. They mitigate the kind of irritation it has produced in inflammation. It is the .same in regard to the greatest part of greasy substances; thus oil, butter, grease, &c. are in general incapable of maintaining suppuration subsequent to blister- ing. To maintain the skin in a proper degree of organic sensibility, indispensable for the purulent discharge, it is requisite that cantharides should be mixed with these substances. The skin does not seem to possess sensible or- ganic contractility. Stimulants in general have no other effect upon it, than to create that slow contraction, imperceptible to the eye, which con- stitutes insensible contractility, and is particularly effected in the small capillary tubes. There is, however, one circumstance in which this kind of contraction is observable in some degree, namely, when cold powerfully acts upon the skin, and braces it. I have already explained the me- chanism of that contraction, the seat of which is in the corium, and which, as well as several other motions I have occasionally described, pre- sent a medium between the two kinds of organic contractilities.DEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. 843 Sympathies. We shall again divide sympathies into active and passive, a division still more applica- ble to this than to the greater part of the other systems, from the numerous examples it affords. Passive Sympathies. Animal sensibility in the skin is often sympa- thetically increased by the affections of other sys- tems. Head-ache, as is well known, often fol- lows the application of cold to the soles of the feet; in a variety of cases, itching and burning sensations are felt in parts that are not otherwise affected. It would be superfluous to mention these instances with which physicians are well acquainted. I shall stop to examine the sympa- thies of heat and cold, wThich have not yet been noticed. Thus I call the sensation experienced in the skin, without either abundance or excess of calo- ric. In inflammation in respect to heat, and in the tying of a large artery in respect to cold, there is an evident cause for sensation. On the contrary, in the instances I am now alluding to, there is nothing more than an aberration of the internal sensitive principle, much resembling that by which pain is referred to the extremity of an amputated limb. It is the same thing when in shiverings, the internal sensitive principle refersT) E R M O ID AI - S V S T K M. 844 to the skin a sensation for which there is no ap- parent cause. Then we warm ourselves by draw- ing close to the fire, not because we are actually cold, but we remove by a real sensation an imagi- nary and quite opposite one, or rather we destroy the perception of this sensation. It is well known) that upon the semen being emitted, a sudden and sympathetic cold is often felt upon the surface. The sensation of cold experienced from fear, as well as the perspiration produced by that passion, generally arise from sympathy of the skin with some epigastric organ that has been influenced by the passion. Let us only consider what takes place at the commencement of most acute and local diseases, for instance, those of the mucous and serous sur- faces, lungs, epigastric viscera, &c. &c. The or- gan which is afterwards the seat of the disease is first disordered ; instantly numerous sympathetic and irregular symptoms are developed in those which are sound; they are the forerunners of the mischief. The disease once formed and pursuing its usual course, a new arrangement, as it were, is established in the economy. The connection be- tween the organs appears to be changed. Amidst the accidental irregularities in the functions, a kind of regularity in the symptoms is observed : by this regularity the disease is characterized and distinguished from others, wherein a different order of morbid connections between the func-845 DEMMOlDAL SYSTEM. tions is observed. Now the transition from the natural to the accidental connection between the functions is marked by a multiplicity of vague symptoms, which proceed from sympathies, and amongst which the kind of shivering I allude to is the foremost. In the early stage of digestion, a kind of sym- pathetic cold over-runs the skin, which in general is quite as warm as usual. It is owing to the state of the stomach acting upon the cutaneous sensibi- lity, and giving rise to a particular sensation, dif- fering, no doubt, from that resulting from the same viscus when disordered, affecting the brain, causing head-aches, &c. but which proceed from the same cause. The sensation of heat is also frequently sym- pathetic, but less so, as I have before observed, than in the mucous system. We are familiar with those flushes of heat, which so often traverse the skin in many fevers, and which are not attended with any increase of caloric. Our modern physicians, perhaps, will hardly conceive how, wTiilst in most cases, a greater or less degree of caloric, than our habitual tempera- ture, is required to produce the sensations of heat or cold, these sensations may arise in a part, with- out its experiencing increase or diminution of temperature. But in most instances, does not pain also proceed from a material cause ? and yet in all sympathies it is produced without this cause.546 DRRMOIDAL SYSTEM. The generality of men, consider the diversity of modifications in the sensations we feel, and suppose that an isolated principle presides over each ; let us throw aside all these modifications, and only consider one sole principle, both in all the irregularities, as well as the regular course of sensibility. Whether this property sympatheti- cally affected by the invasion of diseases, either gives rise to a sensation of heat or cold, as in the skin, of dragging, as in nerves, of weariness, as in muscles, &c. all these are nothing more than varieties resulting from one single cause, a cause we do not perfectly comprehend, but the ex- istence of which is still evident. In general, the sympathies of animal sensibi- lity, call into action in every system, the sensation peculiar to that system ; and which acting upon the skin, would cause a sensation of heat or cold, would produce weariness applied to a muscle, &c. To form to ourselves a correct idea of heat and cold, considered as sensations, let us admit that they may proceed from divers causes : 1st, either from an increase or diminution of caloric in the atmosphere ; 2ndly, from an exhalation or a deficiency of that exhalation in any part of our economy, as in phlegmon, or subsequent to tying the artery of a limb ; 3dly, sometimes, inde- pendent of any antecedent inflammation, a greater proportion of caloric is given out from theDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 847 body, and there is a general increase in tempera- ture ; we feel heat both externally and internally : or again, an additional local exhalation is effected in one part of the skin, and the patient feels heat in that part, as would also a by-stander, by placing his hand upon it; 4thly. To conclude, there are some sympathies belonging to heat, and others to cold. Other parts besides the mucous surfaces and the skin, are liable to experience these sym- pathies : that cool sensation experienced in cer- tain diseases arising from the abdomen, and spreading all over the chest, &c. is well known. The organic properties of the skin are also often sympathetically forced into action. The mo- ment a cold substance is admitted into the sto- mach, whilst the skin is in a state of perspiration, perspiration is instantly suppressed. Hot beverages cause an instantaneous increase of the cutaneous exhalation: an effect so sudden, that it cannot possibly be attributed to an absorption of the fluid on its admission after crossing the lungs into the blood, and subsequently into the exhalents. The production of perspiration in this instance, then, is perfectly analogous to its suppression in the preceding; it is similar to that of fear, or of phthisis, whereby the lungs being affected, act upon the skin, &c. Shall I mention the innume- rable variations observed in this organ in diseases, its dryness, moisture, and abundant perspirations, See. phenomena which are, for the most part.DEKMOIDA 1, SYSTEM. S48 sympathetically produced, and arise from the con- nexions between the healthy organ and the diseased part ? I have alluded to those of the skin and the ,mucous surfaces : with the membrane that lines the stomach they have a particular sym- , patliy. This is exemplified by the phenomena attending digestion. To enumerate all the sym- pathies to which this organ is liable, would re- quire a minute description of every disease. These at times assume a chronic type. How, then, in a number of organic diseases, divers tumours, &c. do sympathies affect the skin ? Precisely in the same manner as petechiee, miliary eruptions, &c. are produced in acute fevers : the only difference is in the duration of the sympathetic phenomena. It is obvious that animal contractility and sen- sible organic contractility cannot possibly be ex- cited in the passive sympathies of the skin, since this organ is denied these properties. Active Sympathies. Each of the four divisions of cutaneous affec- tions we have been viewing, gives rise to a multi- plicity of sympathetic phenomena, of which the following are instances. 1st. Whenever the papillae are strongly ex- cited, as by tickling in persons susceptible of very lively sensations, various organs will be sympathetically affected: sometimes it is the heart, hence syncopies ensue ; at other times it ia849 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. the stomach. Thus I have known persons in whom the slightest tickling would produce vo- miting : at other times again, it is the brain that is affected, as when with very irritable subjects, tickling being carried to some extent will pro- duce convulsions. This is not unfrequently the case with nervous females. Are we not also sen- sible how much the genital organs are influenced by divers parts of the skin being stimulated? Physicians have often been surprised at the as- tonishing effects produced in the economy by quack doctors, who, being conscious of the ad- vantage derived from this species of excitement, have employed it with advantage. But why should we be more surprised at this phenomenon than at vomiting resulting from an affection of the uterus, diseases of the liver, proceeding from an injury sustained by the brain, or the different kinds of head-aches proceeding from affections of the digestive organs. The difference is this, that we may in some degree produce at will these sympathetic phenomena, which in other cases are less evident. Why is not the influence over several organs proceeding from this excitement of the skin more frequently resorted to in practice ? In hemiplegia, in adynamic fevers, &c., may not the irritation of the soles of the feet, so remark- ably susceptible as we experience in ourselves, if applied to hypochondriacs, -&c. in which it is not less so, be preferable, if repeated ten VOL. lie 3 i850 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. or twenty times a-day, to blistering, the effect of which is soon exhausted? Besides, blistering, friction, &c., that act as effectually, even more so, upon the organic than upon the animal sensibility, will never produce such a marked effect, such a general commotion in the sensitive system as that caused by tickling particular parts of the body, and which by acting solely upon the latter species of sensibility, will give rise to phenomena exclusively nervous ; whilst the exhalent and the capillary systems of the red blood are especially affected by the others. There must certainly be cases in which one of these two means must be preferable to the other. I intend to make further inquiries on this subject. The various stimulants employed in diseases have not yet been sufficiently analysed; and the utmost advantage has certainly not been derived from what observation has already taught re- specting the sympathies we can produce volun- tarily. May it not be admitted that nature has established a consent between such distant organs only, that we may avail ourselves of it in our curative means ? The practice of the quack who prescribes this mode of irritation for certain nervous affections, is much better, although he is not sensible of it, than the physician with all the means derived from medicines. Whenever the cutaneous exhalents, or the ex- terior capillary system from which they originate,851 DERM 01 DAL SYSTEM. are in any way affected, the impression is felt by many of the other parts, and this forms a second order of active sympathies of the skin. To this are referred numerous phenomena, some of which are as follows :— The bath, by acting upon the skin during di- gestion, sympathetically affects the stomach, and disturbs its functions. Whenever this viscus is agitated with spasm, the influence of the bath will suddenly compose this organ, and restore it to its natural state. A short time ago, in one of my evening attendances at the Hotel Dieu, I ob- served a female attacked with continued vomit- ing in consequence of a sudden suppression of the periodical discharge. I prescribed sedatives, which produced no effect. The next day I found her in the same state; I ordered a bath, and, on leaving it, she was quite recovered, but the dis- charge had not returned. Few organs are more liable than the stomach to be influenced by the skin. The action of cold upon the skin produces nu- merous sympathetical effects, particularly if ap- plied when this organ is in a state of perspiration. The term, obstructed respiration, is misapplied in expressing what then occurs, and conveys but an incorrect idea. Let us suppose pleurisy to be the result of sudden cold, what follows is the consequence ; the organic sensibility of the skin being suddenly altered, that of the pleura follows .3 i 2DEBMOIDAL SYSTEM. 852 from sympathy. By this change the exhalents become connected with the blood, they are per- meated with this fluid instead of the serum they previously exhaled, and inflammation ensues. When in the summer the skin perspires, the vital powers are increased by the caloric it contains; in that state it is more likely to act sympatheti- cally upon the powers of the other systems. Hence all powerful stimulants applied to this organ are to be dreaded. A proof it is not the suppression of perspiration that is dangerous, but that the danger proceeds from an alteration of the vital powers of the skin, is that the suppres- sion of perspiration in some cases, as in those of phthisis, are never so very injurious; besides this suppression is not so easily effected, because they are not produced by a cause acting directly upon the skin. Now, if the perspiration were actually repelled, all kinds of suppressed perspi- rations would prove fatal. I have never heard that pleuritis was the consequence of the perspi- rations produced by fear, by rheumatism, ^.be- ing suppressed. The mucous fluids would also be repelled whenever pleuritis was occasioned by a draught of cold water. In general we judge by what is the most obvious : suppression of perspira- tion, inflammation of the pleura, &c. are effects, not causes. If the body did not perspire when cold was applied to the skin, inflammation would still ensue. In wounds of the head, attended with853 dermoidal system. abscess of the liver, the fluids have not been repelled. Quivering of the voluntary muscles, the concentration of the pulse resulting from a want of power in the heart, &c. are phenomena resulting merely from the influence exercised by the skin affected by cold. In effect, that organ alone, in common with the origin of the mucous surfaces, and the whole of the bronchia, are chilled by the external air; all the others retain their usual degree of temperature. The innumerable phenomena that proceed from repelling the itch, &c. &c. imprudently effected are well known. In all such cases it does not appear that the morbid matter is con- veyed to other organs, although I do not pre- tend to say but that this might be the case. It is the vital powers of the latter that are exalted, and thus produce divers accidents. Now as these powers vary in each system, of course these ac- cidents must differ essentially from each other. Thus the very same morbid cause withdrawn from the skin, will cause vomiting if directed towards the stomach, in which organ sensible organic contractility predominates; pain is pro- duced if it attack the nerves especially character- ized by animal sensibility ; a disordered state in sight, hearing, and smell, if it invade the re- spective organs of our senses ; hemorrhages, ca- tarrhs, phthisis; tubercular inflammation affect-DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 854 ing the mucous surfaces, the lungs, the serous membranes, &c* in which organs only the organic sensibility is exalted, &c. Now if the same morbid matter conveyed to these divers organs occa- sioned these accidents, they should bear an uni- form stamp. Do not their varieties, and more particularly so their invariable analogy with the vital powers predominating in the organs in which they take place, sufficiently prove that they proceed from the cause adverted to ? It is well known that the serous surfaces and the cellular tissue on the one part, and the skin on the other, are often in reverse states. In cases of dropsy perspiration is suppressed, the dryness of the skin even is sometimes more remarkable than the deficiency of urine, &c. 3dly. Whenever the cellular tissue contained in the areolae of the dermis inflames, as in phleg- monous erysipelas, in boils, in certain malignant pustules, &c. numerous sympathies occur which may be referred to those of the general cellular system, and which have already been explained. 4thly. Even the very affections of the corium, all stamped with a chronic type, owing to the mode of structure and vitality of that part of the skin, also give rise to sympathies bearing the same chronic character, and with which we are but imperfectly acquainted. Organic contractility cannot possibly be sym-855 dermoidal system. pathetically excited in the skin ; since this organ is not possessed of it. Character of the Vital Properties. First Character.— The Vitality of the Cutis varies in each Region. Although we have taken a general view of the vital properties of the skin, yet they are far from being uniform and displaying the same degree in every region. 1st. It cannot be doubted the soles of the feet and palms of the hand are gifted with much more sensibility than any other part. The cutis of the hyponchondriac region is, in some subjects, en- dowed with such exquisite sensibility, that the slightest tickling may produce convulsions. The anterior and lateral part of the trunk are, with- out exception, more susceptible than the dorsal region. 2ndly. The organic properties are not less variable. This, as I have already stated, is ex- emplified by the astonishing facility with which blood traverses the face. It is generally acknow- ledged, that certain parts are better calculated than others for blistering. In this respect it may be remarked that the parts in which animal sensi- bility is found to predominate, are not the same as those in which the organic sensibility is moreDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 856 observable. The sole and palm hold the first rank with regard to the former; the latter is most striking in the face. These varieties are also very obvious in diseases. Who is not aware that such and such parts are especially the seat of such and such diseases. We ought not to be surprised at these varieties, since we have found that the tissue of the dermis varies very considerably, either in re- gard to the papillae, the rete mucosum, or the corium, &c, i Second Character. — Intermission in one respect; continuity in another. The vitality of the cutaneous system is, in re- spect to animal sensibility, essentially intermittent. All the senses present this phenomenon: when the eye has been a long time fixed upon some object, when the ear has been struck with sounds, the nose has perceived odours, the palate flavours, these divers organs become unfit to receive new sensations, and rest is indispensable to recruit their powers. It is the same in respect to sensation and touch : wearied with the impression of sur- rounding bodies, the skin must borrow from a state of remission a new degree of irritability which enables it to receive new impressions. It is known that some time previous to sleep, ex- ternal bodies will produce but an obscure sensa- tion, and that their contact is null in that state; a85 T DEKMOllDAL system. state in which animals appear to be deprived of half their existence. The more the cutaneous sensibility has'been excited, the sounder the sleep ; hence all painful stimulants, strong frictions, &c. are always followed by sound sleep. This sense, however, is sometimes exercised whilst the others are at rest: if the leg of a man be pinched during his sleep, he will draw it without up awaking, and retains not the slightest remembrance of the sen- sation. Thus, those subject to somnambulism, hear, and even will eat, &c.; for as I have already stated, sleep may suppress the animal sensibility of one part only, or of the whole body. In respect to organic sensibility, the vitality of the cutaneous system is essentially continuous; thus, the functions over which this property pre- sides, are quite the reverse of the preceding. In- sensible perspiration is uninterruptedly continued, though more effectually at one time than at an- other. The oily substance is incessantly removed and renewed; it might even occasionally be sup- posed, that whenever the animal sensibility of the skin is suppressed, its organic sensibility is more active. In diseases particularly, this observation, which might also be generally applied to organic life, is obviously striking. This species of vitality is quite as active by night as by day, if not more so. Most of the diseases that vitiate the functions from organic life, acquire additional activity during858 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. night. All fevers by which circulation is disor- dered, increase towards evening. In diseases of the heart, the feeling of suffocation is more frequent towards the decline of day, &c.; and, in phthisis, V which respiration is so materially affected, the hec- tic fevers and perspirations, &c., generally prevail during night. Peripneumony and pleurisy afford frequent instances of increase towards the decline of day. The very same thing is obvious in glan- dular diseases, either acute or chronic. To omit nothing on this head, it would be requisite to con- sider every affection by which the organic func- tions are especially disordered. If, on the con- trary, we observe hemiplegia, epilepsy, convul- sions, the divers degrees of paralysis that affect the organs of our senses, most cases of alienation, apoplexy, &c., and a multiplicity of other affec- tions that especially relate to animal life, we shall not find, very frequently at least, that they admit of that increase towards evening and during night; undoubtedly because this vitality is liable, in the natural state, to be benumbed, as it were, but does not admit of being occasionally increased like the other, which stamps all its affections with this character. Other causes, undoubtedly, con- tributed to this phenomenon, but that to which I allude is a more effectual one. Third Character.—Influence of Sex. ' The sex has a considerable influence upon theDEKM01DAL SYSTEM. 85& vitality of the cutis. In general, the animal part of this vitality is more exalted in females, with whom every thing belonging to sensations is pro- portionally more striking than in man, whose superiority rests in the powers of the muscles des- tined for locomotion. The effects of tickling are much more powerful in females. All arts re- quiring nicety and delicacy of touch, are culti- vated with success by the fair sex. The peculiar texture of the corium, a texture in general of su- perior delicacy, as I have said before, contributes undoubtedly to this phenomenon. In respect to the organic portion of cutaneous vitality, the difference is not considerable: man, even seems to have the advantage in this respect; in general he perspires more abundantly, and his skin being more unctuous, denotes a more abundant se- cretion. Fourth Character.—Influence of the Temper ament. The constitution peculiar to each individual, is a cause not less real of the difference observed in the skin. It is well known that the roughness, hue, suppleness, &c., of the skin varies accord- ingly as the constitution is sanguine or phleg- matic, and that these qualities are even charac- teristic of the different temperament. These qualities are also connected with va- rieties of structure, and we should not therefore be surprised, if the animal sensibility differs so860 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM.* materially, if the touch is so delicate in some individuals, and so dull in others. Some persons can hardly bear tickling, others are but little affected by it, &c. Should we wonder, I say, if in consequence of the innumerable varieties ob- served, that the phenomena over which this sen- sibility presides also vary ; if in some individuals there is a free circulation of blood in the face, whilst in others, habitually pale, hardly any is admitted to that part; if some men perspire abundantly, whilst in others the skin is almost dry ; if the cutaneous oil varies in quantity ; if in some eruptions, either acute or chronic, all differ- ent kinds of pustules are more common, whilst others are almost constantly exempt from such affections, even when exposed to the infection ; if superficial wounds from small instruments of equal size, require a longer or shorter time to cicatrize, the cure of cutaneous affections must also vary, &c. ARTICLE IV. Development of the Dermoidal System. « SECTION I. State of this System in the Foetus. At an early period of conception, the skin is nothing more than a slimy coating, which seems861 DERMOIOAL SYSTEM. to condense by degrees, and form a transparent envelopment, through which the subjacent or- gan, particularly the blood vessels, are partly seen, and which admits of being lacerated by the slightest effort. This state continues nearly two months. The consistence increasing in this organ, soon acquires an aspect approaching more to that observed in infants subsequent to birth. At this period it is excessively thin, its thickness being scarcely one-fourth that of the adult. It appears that the moment this organ begins to rise, its mucous state is the very time when the fibres begin to form. Hitherto it was especially com- posed of cellular tissue and vessels, and as the former contains at this time a superabundant quantity of juices, it is not surprising that it diffuses from the slightest pressure. But as soon as the fibres begin to form, on the one part the cellular tissue diminishes, and is concentrated within the areolae that begins to form; on the other hand, the fibres of the dermis being denser than its laminae, increase its resistance. The greater part of the wrinkles we have spoken of, are never seen on the external sur- face of the skin of the foetus. Those in the face in particular, are never observed, and the almost complete want of motion of the muscles of this part is the reason. The forehead, eyelids, the ridges of the lips, are even and smooth. The superabundant quantity of fat besides, with whichDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 862 the integuments of the cheek are swollen, pre- vent the wrinkles from forming ; but as the hands and feet, from the natural position of the foetus, are bent at their articulations, divers wrinkles are formed in those parts ; in the hand especially, where, however, they are less obvious than at a later period. The curved lines formed by the papillae are more conspicuous in the hand and foot, even when the epidermis is removed. The internal surface of the skin in the foetus is very remarkable for the looseness of its con- nection with the subjacent cellular tissue, the cellulee of which, filled with granulated fat, are easily removed by scraping this surface with the scalpel. The areolae at this epoch are already formed, and proportionally as distinct as at a later period ; on dissecting them from the internal to the external part, they are seen gradually to fade away on reaching the surface, where the skin is condensed. The skin in the foetus is proportionally per- meated with more blood than at any other stage of life. How very correct this assertion is, will easily be ascertained by extracting alive the foetus from the womb of an animal; for after birth (in whatever species,) or in such as have come before the time prescribed by nature, the very cause through which the vital spark has fled, by either increasing or diminishing, in this last moment, the quantity of blood circulated indekmoidal system. 863 the skin, renders it impossible^ form any correct inference respecting its natural proportion. The nerves, as in every other part, are more conspi- cuous; but the papillae, although, as I have al- ready stated, not equally developed. There is no animal sensibility in the skin of the foetus, or if existing, it is excessively obscure. This proceeds from a want of excitement. The surrounding heat is considerable; the liquor amnii, and the parietes of the womb, may in fact give rise to sensations, but as these causes are invariably the same, as they admit of no varieties, the foetus can only have but very faint and imperfect sensations, because a quickness in sensations indispensably requires a renewal of stimulants. It is well known that when heat is applied for a length of time it is not perceptible ; that the sensation resulting from water is almost completely lost by remaining long in the bath., Why ? Because it is in the very nature of habit to deaden sensation, and we are only forcibly acted upon by what is new. Is organic sensibility active in the foetus? Does it produce an alternate exhalation and ab- sorption of the liquor amnii; this is not an opinion generally received, nor even do I believe it probable ; but this question is very far indeed from being as accurately determined as many • other points of physiology. However, it cannot be doubted that there is anDEUMOIDAL SYSTEM. 864 abundant secretion of an unctuous and viscid humour enveloping the whole body of the foetus, and that this secretion is still more plentiful in some parts than in others ; for instance, behind the ears, in the groins, arm-pits* &c ; whether it proceeds from an abundance of secretion, or from the disposition of the parts favouring its accumu- lation. Accoucheurs wipe it off on delivery, and the females of animals lick it from their young. This humor in the foetus seems to be a substitute for that oily fluid with which the skin of the adult is lubricated ; it protects the organ from the liquor amnii. If there are -sebaceous glands it might be supposed to proceed from them ; for it certainly does not flow from the same source as perspiration. When this matter is not removed, it may, by irritating the skin, produce excoriation and a species of erysipelas. It is not dissolved by the air. Nothing similar transudes from the skin of the infant after birth. Is the dark blood only calculated to supply the materials of this substance ? SECTION II. Slate of the Dermoidal System during Growth. At the instant of birth the dermis under- goes a sudden revolution. So far permeated with dark blood, this organ is more or lessDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 865 coloured by it at the moment the infant begins to breathe. Some are completely livid, others pale, but the colour varies considerably. All, however, as soon as they have breathed, acquire more or less of a reddish colour; this pro- ceeds from the arterial blood penetrating the cutaneous vessels, which previously circulated only dark blood. The skin, in this respect, generally indicates what is going on in the lungs. If the infant continues livid for some time, either he has not breathed or breathed im- perfectly. The extremities of the hands and feet in general redden the last; consequently these parts retain the livid hue the longest, if this is at all considerable. The skin is in general uni- formly impregnated with the approaching blood ; the cheeks do not seem to receive a larger pro- portion : the vital powers of the skin are roused by its stimulating properties, and this organ is rendered more fit to receive fresh impressions from the surrounding parts. Let it be remarked, in fact, that a multiplicity of different agents, the surrounding temperature, air, dress, the fluids used to wash the foetus, in quadrupeds the tongue of the parent when licking its young, act so much the more effectu- ally upon the foetus, as it is quite unaccustomed to them, and that the utmost difference exists between these exciting causes, and those to * which it was previously exposed. It is then % VOL. II. .3 KDEKMOJD.U, SYSTEM. 86 6 that the remarkable sympathy which connects the skin with the other organs becomes essentially necessary. The external excitement, namely, that at the origin of the mucous surfaces, and that of all the bronchial ramifications especially call into action a number of organs previously inactive. Then is actually effected, what is observed in syncopy, by which respiration, circulation, cerebral action, and a variety of functions are suspended and suddenly- roused again by exterior friction, by irritating the pituitary membrane, &c. The phenomena are different, but the principles from which they proceed are the same. The organic sensibility is also increased, per- spiration follows : the skin begins to expel various substances with which it was previously unconnected ; it also absorbs different principles applied to its surface. It rarely happens that the skin of the foetus is previously the seat of any kind of eruption, but various kinds of pustules are now frequently seen to invade this organ. Organic sensibility, however, does not appear to be equally increased in every part of the cutis. Long after birth, that of the cranium appears to he possessed of a greater share of vitality ; it is often the seat of various eruptions, all of which denote an excess of the vital powers. The various species of incrustations that occasionally form upon it -are never detected in other parts. InDE R M OID A L S Y S' I’ li M. 8G7 this respect, the scalp, together with the bones of the cranium, and the cerebral membranes accord with the early developement of the brain, which, owing to those circumstances, is more frequently the seat of diseases in infancy, than at any further stage of life. The skin of the face is, seemingly, for some time less active. For some months after birth, that lively carnation is not yet observed, which soon after is spread over the cheeks, and which begins to manifest itself towards the time the sinuses are formed and the teeth cut, at which period the process of nutrition attracts more vital activity to that part. The period of this change is that in which eruptions that are seated in this part of the cutaneous system, as the small pox, measles, &c., generally take place. The skin still retains a remarkable degree of softness for a considerable time after birth ; this organ is permeated with a remarkable quantity of gelatine, and is easily deprived of this substance by boiling which, if continued, will soon dissolve this organ : the fibrous part, observed by Segrim, is very small in quantity. In my opinion it is this remarkable predominance of gelatine in the skin of young animals, that makes it so very easy of digestion. It is well known, that in the calf’s head, lamb, sucking pig, dressed for our meals, it is easily digested ; whilst, when these animals have attained the adult age, and moreDKRMOIDAL SYSTEM. SG8 particularly when they become old, it is indiges- tible. The carnivorous species tear their prey asunder, feed upon the internal organs, upon the muscles, and leave the skin. Now in what con- sists the difference between the skin of young animals and that of old ones? It is that in the former the gelatine predominates over the fibre, whilst in the latter, the fibre is the most abundant. The skin of infants thickens by degrees, and it is only towards the thirteenth year that it ac- quires the thickness it will retain. Until then the difference in this respect accords with the age. If the skin be examined at birth, at two, six, ten, fifteen, and twenty years, &c., these differences will be found most striking. The thicker the skin becomes the more the density it acquires, owing to the predominance of the fibrous substance over the gelatine. In proportion as we advance in age, the ad- hesion of the internal surface of the dermis with the subjacent cellular tissue, becomes much stron- ger; more exertion is required to separate them. By degrees, wrinkles form upon the face : joy and grief operating in quick succession, are the most frequent causes of motion in the features of the infant, and are produced on every occasion by the slightest causes. Now the wrinkles formed upon the eyelids by weeping are more permanent, either because this affection is more frequent than smiling, or because869 DERMOIDAL system. the habitual winking adds to their natural motion, or again, because the parts contain less fat. As the infant is less disposed to smile than to weep, and its cheeks contain a redundant quantity of fat, the perpendicular wrinkles formed by the muscles of the face, which, in this motion, expand the features horizontally, are not so soon formed. The act of sucking, besides that, requires a con- traction of the features opposing their formation. The wrinkles of the forehead are also slow in forming, owing to the motions of frowning, and contracting the eyebrow being rare in the infant, the age of innocence hardly admitting of being disturbed with the gloomy passions these motions proclaim. The development of the dermoidal system is not like the greater part of the others marked by any quick revolution ; it follows an uniform course in its process. At that stage, when the hair begins to grow, it undergoes no change, because it has no relation to this eruption, these new productions merely cross the organ. At the age of puberty it assumes, like every other system, an additional degree of energy. Perspiration is not very abundant; for, it may well be said, that in ge- neral infants do not perspire as much as adults, and that the residue of nutrition is discharged with the urine, which is probably the cause why young subjects are so frequently affected with the stone. After the age of twenty perspirationDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 870 begins to be more abundant, and from that period the humours, particularly in summer, are ex- pelled through that channel. section m. State of the Dermoidal System subsequent to Growth. The skin, for a long time subsequent to growth, continues very active; its excess of vitality enables it, if stimulated in the slightest degree to influence the other organs. Hence the tendency for peripneumonia, pleurisies, &c. from the effect of cold applied when it is in a state of perspiration, in which state it is in general found more likely to exert its fatal influence over all the internal organs, on ac- count of its powers being more excited. Jn respect to the various affections resulting from these influences, they depend entirely upon the interior organs upon which they act. So that from the same cause affecting the skin, will some- times arise affections of the abdomen, at other times of the chest, according to the age at which the vitality of the pectoral or abdominal organs predominate; they are the more disposed to admit of the influence generally extended throughout the economy. The fibrous substance constantly predominat-871 dekmoidal system. ing over gelatine in a progressive ratio, the skin becomes harder in proportion as age advances. It seems to receive less blood, and becomes gra- dually less disposed to those eruptions so fre- quentiy seen in infancy, &c. I shall omit speak- ing of the other distinctions, for all that has been mentioned in the preceding paragraph refers especially to the adult age. I shall merely observe, that if during the greatest part of life the skin is so frequently the source of diseases, that if the various alterations it undergoes so very frequently disorder the in. ternal organs, it is merely owing to the variety of exciting causes, to which this organ is uninter- ruptedly exposed. If the other organs are not so often influenced by the glands, serous surfaces, &c., it is because, being deep seated, and almost constantly subjected to the same stimulants, their vital powers are not liable to such numerous re volutions. The fluids secreted and exhaled in the serous and synovial systems are not there- fore quite so liable to the considerable increase or sudden suppression so often exemplified with respect to perspiration. It may also be observed, that society has added considerably to the pernicious influence of the stimulants to which the skin is submitted ; I allude particularly to the rapid transition from heat to cold, by which the latter acts more forci- bly upon the cutaneous sensibility, which, likeDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 872 that of every other system, answers the more effectually the stimulants applied to it, as they are the more reverse of those whose influence it previously experienced. In the natural state, there is nothing more than the succession of sea- sons ; and even then, nature has connected cold and heat together by a succession of impercepti- ble links, and there is rarely any abrupt transi- tion. But in society, the varieties of dress, the artificial degrees of temperature in our apart- ments, degrees first quite different from that of the open atmosphere, and from each other, so that the same individual, by entering in winter thirty different apartments, often exposes himself to thirty different degrees of temperature; the hard labour of the generality of men, and which are attended with violent perspiration ; every thing, in short, affords innumerable causes for rapid variations in the powers of the dermoidal system. Thus in cities the mucous surface of the bronchise is incessantly in contact with num- berless different causes of irritation, with which the air is naturally loaded. Thus our aliment, dressed in a thousand different ways, differing in temperature, &c. continually varies the action of the mucous surface of the digestive organs, and gives rise to a multiplicity of affections, from which most other parts of the animal creation are free, in consequence of the uniformity of their food.873 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. If, by a permanent uniformity in the stimu- lating agents, the skin and mucous surfaces were constantly in the same degree of excitement, they would certainly never afford such an ample source of diseases as is obviously exemplified in the foetus which is hardly ever diseased ; because all the exterior causes, which act upon its cutaneous and mucous sensibilities, as heat, the fluids, the parietes of the womb, admit of no varieties until birth. At this period immersed in a new medium, animals, viewed even in a natural state, meet with a greater number of varieties in the stimu- lants, that act upon them, and hence their diseases are much more frequent after birth. In society, where in the number of stimulating agents by which the surfaces intended to be in contact with exterior forms are sometimes tenfold and more, is it to be wondered that diseases should be so disproportionate to those with which the brute creation are affected. SECTION IV. State of the dermoidal System in old Age. Towards the decline of life, the dermoidal sys- tem becomes denser and tighter ; it is softened with difficulty by boiling, and the gelatine ob- tained from it is much less abundant, firmer, and874 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM# more consistent, I believe it is unfit to make any kind of glue, even the coarsest, unless it be mixed with that of adult animals. Its yellowish hue turns very dark, and when coagulated by cold, it requires very intense and long continued heat to reduce it to a liquid state : the fibrous portion of the dermis, which never melts, or at least resists a long time, is proportionally much more considerable. It is the same as in respect to bones, wherein the gluten is in a reverse pro- portion, and the earthy part in a direct one with age. Like every other tissue, that of the dermis becomes dense and tough ; it can no longer be used as food ; it would resist the tooth. When it has been tanned it is much more resistant, less supple, and on that account, cannot be applied to the same uses as that of young animals. Every body knows the difference between calfs-leather and ox-leather, especially if the latter be rather old. Their difference first proceeds from thick- ness, which being more considerable in the latter prevents its being so easily bent in various di- rections: then from the very nature itself of the tissue. If a hide be divided horizontallv; each half will be as thick as the undivided calf skin, and yet it will not be so supple. Of course this must be in the same state with regard to tanning, t&C. &c. Submitted to desiccation, the tissue of the875 DEUMOIDAL SYSTEM# human dermis becomes much stiffer in an aged subject, than in younger ones. Maceration re- quires more time to soften it; the hair by this last process is much sooner removed from the skin of an infant, than from that of an old man : this part of the tanning process is attended, as tanners have often experienced, with more labour and difficulty with old skins than with young ones# I have observed that penetrated with infinitely more hair the skin of animals when compared with that of man presents an innumerable quantity of small pores on its external surface, which allow- ing the tan to insinuate itself into the areolas of the dermis, and filling them completely with a new substance by its combination with gelatine, converts its cellular tissue into a solid one. The preparatory maceration of the hide not only facilitates the removal of the hair, but also by dis- tending the fibres of the areolae and the pores, it favours the introduction of tan. The more we advance in age, the less the skin is permeated with blood. The flush of the cheeks has passed from the aged subject. Then the pink hue observed before in the exterior habit of the youth and even of the adult, and which proceeded from the vessels twining through the cellular tissue of the areolm of the corium is no longer to be seen. The continual pressure of exterior forms then, considerably increases the adhesion of the cellularDKUMOIDa l system. 87 6 tissue with the dermis. They cannot be separated without the utmost difficulty, by directing the knife along the internal surface of the corium ; a circumstance which also depends upon the cellu- lar tissue being denser, and not so easily torn, for such laceration is unavoidable then, on account of the continuity of the sub-cutaneous layer with that which penetrates the areolas. The exterior surface of the skin is rough and uneven. The wrinkles alluded to, become much more visible ; some of them belong exclusively to this stage of life. In old age, the vital powers of the dermoidal system are much sooner impaired than those of any other system, because it is more excited during life by external causes. At this stage of life, the impression received from the contact ol most of them is very dull. Habit has deadened animal sensibility : touch is imperfect; for as I have already stated the exercise of this sense requires the interference of will. We touch any thing that has struck the eye, the ear, palate, &c. and by that act, we either rectify or confirm these sensations ; but the aged subject, long made familiar with the objects he is sur- rounded with, has neither want nor inclination to touch. Let us only compare in this respect the two extreme stages of life. Every thing that strikes the sensitive organs of the infant is new to him, and consequently conveys new sensa-877 DERMGIDAIi SYSTEM. lions, he exerts himself to touch and grasp at every thing; his little hands are in continual motion. To touch is a pleasure to him, for every new object of sensation has something pleasing in itself. If in his latter days man were suddenly surrounded with objects that had never struck him before, he would much oftener be induced to touch them. But nothing is new to him in the objects wdth which he has been familiar from his cradle. This explains why old age is not the best time for enjoyment. Pleasures, then, are merely relative; actual ones we no longer possess: then the former are lessened by habit, and cease because they have existed. The more the sensations have been accumulated with years, the less novelty they afford, and, consequently, the less fruitful is the source from which they arise. On the contrary, our happiest day^ are those of infancy, because the ample field of sensations lays wide open before us. As we proceed in our career, at every step we leave some cause or other of enjoyment behind us; and, on reaching the close of life, we expe- rience nothing more than indifference, a state per- fectly suitable to our situation, from its being cal- culated to shorten the distance that separates life from death. In the aged subject, the organic sensibility of the skin is not less impaired than its animal sensi- bility : hence the following phenomena; 1st. Con- tagious effluvia are not easily absorbed, because878 I) Li H MO I DAL SYSTEM. they produce less effect upon the cutaneous sur- face ; 2dly. Perspiration is less abundant, because the skin is no longer liable to those exacerbations so frequently detected in the adult; 3dly. The oily substance also is more sparingly supplied : hence the habitual dryness observed in the skin, and, in some cases the chafing of the epidermis, &c. All diseases that imply an increase of this organic sensibility, are much less common, as is exemplified in erysipelas and the different kinds of eruptions; and, whenever these affections occur, they assume a remarkably chronic type ; 5thly. the skin has much less power to resist cold, and it is easily deprived of its caloric, which inces- santly tends to combine with the surrounding atmosphere : thus, heat is always sought after in old age ; 6thly. I am fully convinced that at thai age the skin has not the same power of resisting a temperature superior to that of the body, and that as it easily suffers the interior caloric to escape into a colder atmosphere, it would suffer that from without to penetrate the body. It might be very interesting to repeat, at these two opposed stages of life, the experiments made by the English physicians.SYSTEM OF THE EPIDERMIS. If objects are examined with even the slightest attention, it will not be difficult to perceive the immense difference that exists between the pre- ceding system and this, which physiologists have considered as a part of the latter. In the organ- ization, properties,composition, functions, growth, &c., there is nothing similar in them : a bare inspection is sufficient to mark the line that sepa- rates them. In this I have included ; 1st. The external epi- dermis; 2dly. That spread over the mucous sys- tem, or, at least, over one of its parts ; 3dly. The nails, which, although very different in external appearance from the epidermis, have in many respects so strong a resemblance, that I consider it almost unavoidable not to include them in one and the same system. In fact, the nails are, as it were, the epidermis of that part of the skin sub- jacent to them; they are obviously continued with that of the fingers ; their fall and regeneration880 EPIDKRMOIDAL SYSTEM. during life are attended with the very same phe- nomena. Their composition and the property of forming excrescences are perfectly analogous. Subsequent to death, the nails are loosened by the same means as the epidermis, and then form, as it were, a part of it, &c. ARTICLE I. Of the External Epidermis. The outward epidermis is a transparent mem- brane, more or less thick according to the region, covering the skin in its whole extent, and receiv- ing consequently the immediate impression of external forms, which would otherwise act too powerfully upon the cutaneous organ. SECTION i. Fonns, Connections, fyc. with the Dermis. The very same wrinkles are observed upon the epidermis as upon the skin, because being per- fectly contiguous they are folded together. Dif- ferent pores after having crossed this membrane open upon its surface. Some transmit the hair, and they are the most conspicuous ; others open a passage to the exhalents, and these are less per- ceptible in the natural state, owing to their oblique direction, and to their opening betweenEPIDKR MOIRA L SYSTEM. 881 these two small laminae, which being' pressed against each other when perspiration is suspended, conceal their apertures; but if perspiration be suddenly produced when in a very dry state/as from the effect of very hot beverages, for instance, then the small drops which proceed from the cutaneous surface, not having had sufficient time to spread into a moist layer, but being left iso- lated on the parts wherein they are observed, the orifices of the exhalents are detected. Besides, if a moderate portion of the epidermis be exa- mined in a favourable light, a multiplicity of small pores separated by interstices, and crossing its thickness in an oblique direction are observed. The soles of the feet and palms of the hand only, do not admit of them. It is absolutely impossi- ble to distinguish, between these pores, the ab- sorbents from the exhalents, even when mercury is forced by friction into the former. The internal surface of the epidermis is very firmly attached to the skin. The means of union are, first, the exhalents, absorbents, and the hair, which in crossing the former adhere to it more or less, and thus fix it to the latter from which they originate. On removing the epider- mis by maceration, which is the best means to preserve it uninjured, a multiplicity of small pro- longations of various extent, and which, on being examined with due attention, appear to be no- thing more than the divided ends of the exhalents 3 L VOL* JI.88 2 EPIDEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. and absorbents, are observed. In fact, these small prolongations which are easily elevated, and bear the appearance of small threads, rather long, but nothing more than a kind of unevenness if left short, are all seen to take an oblique direc- tion, and to terminate in the pores that cross the dermis, in order, as I have said, to open on its surface. Their existence is sufficient at first glance, and without the assistance of the glass to distinguish the internal surface of this membrane from the external. The spaces that separate them are more or less extensive, and the connection is less on a level with these spaces. Over these are formed those numerous vesicles with which the skin is covered on being scalded. The depressed interstices which separate these vesicles, are the parts to which the exhalents that pre- vented the epidermis from rising, correspond : these also separate when ebullition is long con- tinued. It cannot be doubted that all these vascular prolongations must effectually help to unite the epidermis with the corium. I am not aware how that adhesion is effected in the interspace, but it actually exists, and, as I have previously stated, the cellular tissue does not appear to interfere with it. Every one knows that a variety of causes will destroy the adhesion of the epidermis, and raise it. These causes are: 1st. Every acute inflain-epidermoidal system. 883 mation, let- the nature be what it may. In erysi- elas, phlegmon, boils, and other similar tumours is necessarily raised ; but this is not produced by the interposition of any fluid. None could be supplied by the exhalents, since they are over-run with blood; on rising, the membrane is dry. 2dly. The epidermis is also elevated by various cutaneous eruptions unattended with inflamma- tion, as in porrigo. In these cases it most com- monly drops a kind of dry exfoliation; hence undoubtedly originated an opinion with certain authors who have ascribed a scaly structure to this membrane, an opinion, unsupported by any experiment or observation whatever taken from the natural state of the epidermis. This exfoliation merely proceeds from the very same cause by which the vesicles are formed upon the skin soon after this organ has been im- mersed in boiling water, namely, from the stronger adhesion of the exhalents that resort to the pores of the epidermis. It may be observed that those scales, in fact, which do not belong to the nature of the membrane, but merely to the mode in which it is raised, are never met with, except in the interstices by which the pores are sepa- rated ; for instance, when an eruption has formed on the chin, the epidermis is not detached at the pores, but only in their interstices, but as these distances are of course remarkably small, the ex- foliation must be so, it forms a kind of dust as it 3 Ij 2884' EPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. were. 3dly. Whenever the epidermis is at all elevated, the slightest friction will raise it en- tirely in those parts. Thus subsequent to dry friction, if considerable, a rough skin becomes scaly, whilst a smooth one will undergo no alte- ration. It is even this that, in common with the outward appearance, so powerfully contributes to the imperfection of the one, and to the beauty of the other. 4thly. Subsequent to violent fevers, and even to several affections of the internal vis- cera, the skin that has been sympathetically affected by the disease, has become the seat of an affection which, without any outward manifesta- tion, has yet been never sufficient to separate it from the epidermis, which is elevated in all di- rections. 5thly. Blistering, as is well known, by which a considerable quantity of serum is drawn to the external, surface of the corium, drys up the exhalents that cross from this membrane to the epidermis, so that this serum is effected under the latter, and forms a considerable collection. Water will not ooze through the open pores, owing to their parietes being collapsed by their oblique insertion through the epidermis, the pres- sure of the water itself stopping up the passage; for the very same reason an isolated portion of the epidermis will receive and contain mercury with- out suffering its particles to infiltrate through the pores, although, as I have previously stated, these pores are remarkably obvious when thatepidermoidal system. 885 portion is exposed in a favourable light. 6thly. The greater part of the preceding means, which can only act in consequence of a disordered state of the vital powers, are ineffectual with respect to the skin : putrefaction, maceration, and ebullition, are the only means that will succeed. All act by dividing the prolongations extended from the dermis to the epidermis, although the mechanism by which this separation is effected is but imper- fectly known. SECTION 11. Organization, Composition, 6fc. Authors have given way to numerous con- jectures which it is unnecessary to repeat here, respecting the structure of the epidermis. The following lines will contain what has been de- monstrated by strict observation. The thickness of this membrane is, generally speaking, rather regular throughout all its parts. It has not ap- peared to me to vary in this respect according to the varieties of thickness of the skin, in the back, abdomen, or in the limbs, &c. The soles of the feet, the palms of the hands, and corresponding surface of the fingers, are the only parts wherein this thickness is increased, and in these parts the increased thickness is so very striking, that it bears no comparison with the epidermis in other886 EPIDE RM0IDAL SYSTEM. parts: this disproportion is particularly striking in the heel, and seems to be owing to different laminae being applied over each other, and super- added to the general epidermis; but there is also an actual difference in the organization with which we are not perfectly acquainted : for in- stance, whenever by means of maceration, the epidermis has been removed from over these parts, these small prolongations and irregularities, rather regularly disseminated, and which are nothing but the remains of the lacerated ex- halents, and observed in others are never detect- ed : in these parts the vessels are more evenly ruptured on the internal surface of the epidermis, where the wrinkles I have adverted to only can be traced. To this excessive thickness of the epidermis in the soles of the feet and palms of the hands I at- tribute the difficulty, nay, the impossibility, of blistering these parts; this application I had often prescribed, conceiving that they were en- dowed with more sensibility: I expected greater effect in certain diseases, but every attempt having proved fruitless, I was obliged to give it up. The epidermis is, by this thickness, deprived of the transparency it is seen to retain in other parts; in the hand and foot it is whitish and even opake: thus the epidermis being colourless in blacks, suffers every where the blackness of the water, cannot be destroyed by long continued887 EPIDERMOID A L SYSTEM. subjacent rete mucosum to appear, but partly con- ceals this hue in these parts. I have observed, however, by maceration, that the lighter hue of the palm and sole in these depends, in this species, upon the rete mucosum being actually less co- loured. It may be supposed that in this region, wherein the capillary net seems less abundant, every thing that relates to animal sensibility, all the phenomena which proceed from organic sen- sibility, are much less active. After having examined in this view the hand and foot of a black subject, I have been led to try some experiments on the colour of the rete mu- cosum which will be the subject of a short digres- sion. 1st. By immersing in boiling water any portion of the dermis, its dark shade becomes almost instantly deeper, which is probably owing to the fibres being drawn nearer together by the contraction which concentrates the colouring par- ticles. This phenomenon is very remarkable on comparing the part immersed with one belonging to the very same region that was not. 2dly. If maceration be continued a month or two, the epidermis may sometimes be removed inde- pendent of the rete mucosum, the seat of colour; at other times the whole is removed together. 3dly. No visible effect will be produced by being left in cold water for a day or two. 4thly. The deep black hue suddenly produced by boil-EPIDEIlMOIDA L SYSTEM* 888 ing; but by scraping with a knife the ex- ternal surface of the skin, which is then reduced into a kind of gelatinous pulp, the coloured rete mucosum is easily removed from it, although it still remains attached to a small portion of the corium. 5thly. Sulphuric acid,by which the skin, as every other organ, is diffused into a kind of pulpy state, is also successfully used to remove this coloured part, which comes off by shreds, but without the hue being affected. 6thly. Nitric acid, though rather concentrated, is not so effectual: it gives to the internal surface of the skin and epidermis a yellowish aspect; but does not appear to me to produce much of that effect on the black hue of the corpus reticulare. 7thly. If a portion of the African’s skin be macera- ted a whole day in a solution of nitrate of silver, the colour appears to undergo no change. I have obtained the same result by trying a solution of potash. Sthly. Putrefaction removes the coloured portion of the skin, with the epidermis, at other times without it, but the colour is not altered. I have tried no other agents to ascertain the nature of the colour of the skin in negroes. But let us return to a consideration of the epidermis. Wherever it is very thick, as in the concave surface of the foot and hand, it is most evidently found composed of laminae, and which, owing to their close attachment, are not easily separated.epidekmoidal system. 889 except in the hands and feet, never more than a single layer is to he seen : the tissue of the epider- mis contains no fluid at all. But in every direc- tion either in the living subject, or in the corpse, nothing transudes: the exfoliations are always dry, nay even brittle : it contains no blood vessels. The absorbents and exhalents merely cross this membrane, they form no anastomoses, neither do they twine in previous to reaching its surface, as is the case with the serous membranes, which are therefore rendered darker by injections, though apparently a small quantity of blood only is cir- culated in them during life. The colour of the epidermis, on the contrary, is never changed by injection, even when the fluid, being very liquid, has succeeded to the utmost, and showers over the external surface of the skin. Thus in inflam- mation, when the cutaneous exhalents are gorged with blood which they did not contain in the natural state, this fluid never penetrates the epi- dermis, which always remains free from the diseases that invade the subjacent layer, and which being merely loosened by inflammation, falls, and is again regenerated. The epidermis like the cellular tissue is evidently not supplied with nerves. The granulations also which are especially formed by this last tissue, are never seen to originate from this mem- brane ; nor do its excrescences assume such a varied character as the tumours which the cellu-890 EPIDEKMOIDAL .SYSTEM. lar tissue especially contributes to form, as the fungous, schirrous tumours, &c. &c. Hence it is obvious, that the system of the epidermis does not partake of the general systems common to all the other organs. It does not rest then upon the same basis common to every organized part; in this point of view it is inorganic as it were. No fibres are seen in the interior of this tissue : in general it is not very resistant, and is lacerated by the slightest distention, except in the fingers and hand where it is thicker. The action of air has little or no influence upon the epidermis: but when, after having been re- moved, a considerable surface is exposed to it, it rather hardens, becomes in some degree more con- sistent, and is not quite so easily torn. Excepting the nails and hair, this in the natural state is of all the organs the least altered by desiccation; It is also made rather more transparent by this pre- paration ; but re-assumes its former appearance on being again immersed in water, which proves it contained some in this state. The action of air, so powerful upon the skin that has become putrid, leaves it perfectly uninjured : it is merely raised but does not putrify. Separated by this process, and cleared of the putrid substances which might have adhered to it, it does not exhale any offensive smell: long exposed to damp air by itself, and perfectly isolated from all the adjacentEPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 891 parts, it remains unchanged. After the hair and nails, I consider it as the most incorruptible animal substance. I possess a foot, found in a cemetery, in which the skin and fat are trans- formed into a firm, greasy substance, which burns when lighted, whilst the nature of the epidermis which is very thick, has hardly undergone any change at all. The action of water may be considered in different points of view. 1st. During life this fluid whitens it, if the contact has been con- tinued, and at the same time it causes it to wrinkle in different parts. This phenomenon is observable on the hand on leaving the bath, and is more particularly obvious ten or twelve hours after the application of an emollient poultice, in which the action of the meal did not prevent the water from producing its effect. The white- ness of the epidermis seems in this case to pro- ceed, from its being actually impregnated with the fluid. This phenomenon is the very same as that observed in the serous, and fibrous mem- branes, &c., which being first rendered artificially transparent by drying, again become white on being immersed in water. Here the epidermis by no means transparent, whitens by the addition of this fluid, and in this state the sensibilitv of the papillae is much diminished; I have often tried the experiment upon myself; as soon as the water which has penetrated the epidermis isEPIDEUMOIDAL SYSTEM 892 evaporated, it re-assumes its transparency, returns to its natural state and sensibility, and is restored to the parts. This phenomenon besides is particularly observed in the epidermis of the hand and foot, for in any other part it is hardly ever seen. 2ndly. The epidermis removed from the skin of a corpse and committed to water, also wrinkles, but does not whiten. Left macerating in this fluid, it does not become putrid only, a multipli- city of particles are seen to rise above the water, and which being in juxta-position, form a white pellicle, the nature of which is unknown. After it has been macerated for two or three months, this membrane softens without swelling, and is easily lacerated; but it is never diffused into a pulp, similar to that of other organs that have undergone the same process. 3dly. The epi- dermis will not, like other organs, contract and shrink at the time of ebullition ; hence, whilst by this contraction, the surface of the skin is considerably reduced, the epidermis remains the same, it wrinkles in divers directions. When- ever ebullition has been long continued, this membrane becomes less resistant, is easily torn, but never reduced to gelatine, it does not assume yellowish aspect, is not elastic, as the organs from which a considerable quantity of this sub- stance is obtained ; this tissue, besides, as is well known, will not admit of being tanned, it even forms an obstacle to it ; for when boiledE PI DERM01 DAL SYSTEM. 893 for a considerable time, the different laminae of which the epidermis of the palm of the hand and sole of the foot is composed, are easily sepa- rated from each other: this is even the best method to investigate accurately their structure : small vesicles filled with serum, often form between these laminae in the foot. ; The effects of heat upon the epidermis, are quite different from those experienced by the other systems from the contact of this body. A shred of this membrane perfectly dried by air, and exposed to the light of a candle, 1st, will hardly shrink, as would a piece of the cutis for instance, under similar circumstances ; 2ndly, it exhales a foetid smell, similar to that of burning horn, and different from that of every other tissue, also undergoing conflagration ; 3dly, it will also burn with the utmost rapidity, which is not the case with the preceding systems thus pre- pared ; frequently, if is only requisite to light one end that the whole may be consumed ; 4thly, in the flame a blackish fluid boils out, and escapes in drops, similar in every respect to those of a burning quill. This is evidently oil, which keeps up the flame, by its being so excessively abundant, and except in the hair and nails, it is not so abundant in any other part. This oil deserves a particular attention ; it is this oil that gives that very offensive smell, and forms those whitish and inflamed drops just mentioned. ItEPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 894 seems to be of the same nature as that which Bertholet has extracted from hair in such abun- dance ; combustion leaves after it a blackish coal, which I have not analysed. Light seems to have no great effect upon the epidermis, which I have found of the same colour, both in skins rendered darker by it, and those that were not. The epidermis is evidently turned yellow by nitric acid, and much more so than any other ani- mal substance; but is not dissolved by it without the utmost difficulty. The sulphuric acid, on the con- trary, acts very powerfully upon this organ, par- ticularly if it be rather concentrated. On being withdrawn, after having remained therein some time, it is found excessively thin, remarkably trans- parent, and almost similar in this respect to the peeling of an onion. I have repeatedly been struck with this singular phenomenon. If left too long in this liquor it will be completely dis- solved. Alkaline solutions also dissolve this membrane, but only slowly ; pure alkali has a very rapid effect. Alcohol is wholly useless ds a solvent. SECTION III. Properties. The epidermis does not admit of being much extended, since the slightest cutaneous tumour,'895 EPltiERMOIDAL SYSTEM. will split and raise it, either by exfoliation, as in cutaneous eruptions, or by a more extensive sheet, as from blistering ; however, it seems not to be altogether deficient in this property, as is exem- plified by the distention observed subsequent to the latter case. This tissue does not possess the least power of contraction; after applying a blister, it remains loose, and never contracts. The epidermis is completely destitute of any kind of animal sensibility whatever, it may be punc- tured, divided, and torn asunder with impunity. The soles of the feet, and palms of the hands, afford ample means for such experiments. The thickness of this membrane is such in these parts, that layers may be removed, as is seen by trying the edge of a knife ; that it admits, as we may see in our kitchens, of being in contact with burning coals ; that it is not impossible to tread upon a red hot iron, &c. It is owing to this insensibility, that this membrane opposes the action of acids, the caustic, alkalies, and of all powerful stimulants, which are so excessively painful when brought in contact with the dermis, exposed by a blister. The epidermis differs from the other organs, which as well as this are deprived of animal sen- sibility, as the cartilages, tendons, aponeuroses, &c. inasmuch as it can never acquire this pro- perty ; whilst the latter will sometimes attain, by being strongly excited, a degree superior toEPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 896 that in organs naturally gifted with it. What is the reason of this ? From its being indispensably requisite that the rudiments of animal sensibility should previously exist in an organ, for its de- velopment, and that this organ also should be possessed of organic sensibility, which on being increased by stimulants, is changed into animal sensibility: now the epidermis appears to be also deprived of this last property, as well as of in- sensible contractility. In fact, 1st, it has no ap- parent circulation; 2ndly, the exhalents and absorbents by which it is crossed have no connec- t on with this membrane; ordly, no morbid phenomenon, which naturally supposes organic sensibility, has ever been detected in the epider- mis. It never inflames ; in every cutaneous affec- tion it is entirely passive, and in spite of continuity never partakes of the infection. The impossi- bility of its inflaming renders it wherever it exists an obstacle to cutaneous adhesions that can never be effected but after it has been removed : nor will its internal surface, raised by blistering, and again applied over the dermis after the eva- cuation of the fluid through a puncture, ever unite. 4thly. The excrescences that have their seat in this membrane, as corns, particular indu- rations, &c. are, as well as the very membrane itself, inert, dry, and void of internal circulation ; if they are attended with pain, it is owing to tlie pressure the subjacent nerves are exposed to ; theE FID E K M OID A L SYSTIiM. 897 exciescences are not painful. 5thly. There is no visible elaboration effected in the epidermis ; like all other inorganic forms it wears by friction, and is again renewed. Physiologists have not paid sufficient attention to this continued destruction of the epidermis. Its reality is proved as follows : 1st. If its exter- nal surface be rather strongly scraped with a knife, a quantity of dust, soluble in nitric acid, and of a grayish aspect, is obtained. The epidermis becomes whiter in this part, and soon re-assumes its original hue, particularly on being moistened. On applying the knife again, this dust is no longer produced; to produce this an interval of twelve or twenty hours is required. 2ndly. This substance becomes superabundant when the skin has remained long unwashed. Hence the prodigious quantity that is obtained by steeping the feet in water and scraping them, where this healthy precaution has been long neglected. It is remarkably abundant in the soles of the feet. In the corpse it is often seen to form an additional layer to the epidermis, but perfectly distinct from it, and easily removed. This circumstance I attribute to the thickness of the epidermis in this part. It is often noticed in hospital patients after they have remained long in bed without being cleaned. Water naturally removes this substance pro- duced by the destruction of the epidermis, and VOL. II. . 3 M s898 EP1 DERM 01 DAL SYSTEM. which being mixed with the residue of the per- spiration, renders bathing a natural want, as I have previously observed. Although this sub- stance is neither exhaled nor absorbed, and it ap- pears to be produced by friction, the epidermis in this respect may still be ranked amongst the emunctories of the body, since it is renewed by a substance supplied by the dermis in proportion as it is destroyed. Since the epidermis is not possessed of vital properties, it is obvious that it cannot be the seat of any sympathies whatever, which are aberra- tions of these properties. Hence its vitality is exceedingly obscure; nay, I even doubt if it has any. We might be induced to think it a semi- organized matter, which nature has interposed be- tween the exterior inert bodies and the dermis, which is essentially organized, to form the transi- tion and link of communication. The epidermis is possessed of a property very distinct from those of most of the other systems ; it is that of being reproduced; the new being in every respect similar to that which has been re- moved. This even separates it from a fewT other systems, which like the cellular system, throw out granulations when they have been exposed, but which are only irregularly reproduced, and very different from their natural state. How can the reproduction of the epidermis be explained ? Is it the pressure of atmospheric air that makes the899 SPIDER SUOTDAL SYSTKM. external surface of the skin rough ? Is it formed by the air, which acting upon what flows from the surface, produces a new substance ? I do not know. It is certain, 1st. That this production is quite distinct from those of the internal organs. 2ndly. That it can only form upon the skin, and that the slight pellicle which all other cicatrized parts are covered with, subsequent to a wound attended with loss of substance, cannot be compared with it, and even present quite a different texture. Thus, this pellicle is not removed by the same means as the epidermis, and it certainly becomes the seat of a quick sensibility, which the epider- mis will never possess. This is particularly ex- emplified in change of weather, when cicatrices become as is well known exceedingly painful. I have often remarked then, that not only the in- terior of the cicatrice, but the pellicle itself is remarkably affected : besides on this pellicle forming it is evidently overrun with blood vessels, whilst nothing similar to this is ever observed in the regeneration of the epidermis. It is this faculty of reproducing itself that comes into play in a number of excrescences in the epidermis, as in corns and callosities, which have nothing more in common with those that line fistulee, &c. but the name. All these excrescences are denied sensibility, vessels and nerves, and present the same degree of con- sistence and the same hue as the epidermis; they 3 m 2900 EPlUKRMOfDAL SYSTEM. often drop from it and are again formed. Pres- sure appears to have considerable influence upon their production Tight shoes, the solid forms grasped by smiths and other mechanics, are often the cause. I have preserved nearly the whole skin of a subject who died in the Hotel Dieu, and whose epidermis, treble in point of thickness from his infancy, nay even in his mother’s womb to what it should be in the natural state, had been subject during the whole of his life to a kind of con- tinual exfoliation, which gave it throughout its whole extent the appearance of a general eruption, although nothing similar to this affection had formed in the dermis which was perfectly healthy. The face only was free from this affection. The epidermis not only reproduces itself when it has been wholly removed, but even when super- ficial laminae only have been carried off, particu- larly in the hand and foot, where other sheets are superadded to those which have been exposed by the section : which evidently proves that they were not formed by the dried juices of the rete mucosum. SECTION iv. Developement. Those who have admitted that the epidermis formed by pressure, would have undeceivedEPIDERM01DAL SYSTEM. 901 themselves had they studied that of the foetus, already strongly characterized, even more so than several other systems. It is observed that from the moment the skin begins to lose that kind of pulpy state we have already asserted to exist towards the end of the fifth month, it acquires proportions analogous to such as will be subsequently produced. Very thick in the sole of the foot and palm of the hand, it is very thin in any other part, and is easily removed by using the means I have described. In the foetus that has become putrid in the womb it is partly loosened as is well known. On a level with the umbilical cord it is continued in an insensible manner with the skin. At birth, although coming in contact with a fluid new to it, it undergoes no great alteration, which evidently proves, that the air has but very little to do with its formation ; as age advances it becomes thicker, and follows in this respect nearly the same properties as the skin. On reaching the age of twenty-six or thirty, it ceases to increase. I have raised the epidermis in different parts of an aged subject, but found no great difference with that of an adult, only it was rather more liable to exfoliation, and somewhat thicker. In those unfortunate wretches that sometimes seek a shelter in hospitals vermin are frequently seen to thrive in the crevices it con- tains, and subsequently to invade the spaces be-EPIDERM01DAL SYSTEM. 902 tween the laminee they have elevated ; thus I have seen the epidermis shelter millions of these filthy creatures that were evidently lodged be- tween two of its laminae, without reaching either the corpus reticulare, or the papillse. This even has been the only means afforded me to ascertain the laminated structure of the epidermis, in other / parts than in the hand and foot, where I have never observed these insects. The chaps in the dermis seem- to depend in old age upon its dryness arising from deficiency of exhalation, which renders the skin so rough and hard. What moreover contributes to it is, that as it offers on account of its numerous folds a variety of projecting parts, the epidermis is exfoliated by the friction these parts are more exposed to; thus in the adult a rough skin becomes scaly by the very same cause, whilst a smooth skin, and well distended by fat, may be rubbed without causing the least exfoliation. ARTICLE II. Internal Epidermis. All authors have acknowledged the epidermis of the mucous membranes. It even appears that many of them have thought there was only this part of the skin that entered the cavities to line them. Haller himself entertained this opinion ;903 E PI DERMOID A L SYSTEM. but the slightest inspection will be sufficient to convince that here, as in the skin, it only forms a superficial covering to the papillae and corium. Removed by boiling water from the palate, tongue, pharynx, it even leaves the two other layers exposed. SECTION I. Epidermis at the origin of the Mucous Surfaces. At the divers origins of the mucous surfaces the epidermis is remarkably distinct, as on the glands, in the openings of the arms, urethra, fossae nasales, mouth, &c. Its presence in those parts is proved by the excoriations that occur, particularly in the lips; by dissection with a very thin lancet; by the action of boiling water, maceration, putrefaction, and even by the epispastics, as is exemplified in the mode used by the ancients, who used this means for the operation of the hare-lip. This epidermis is much thinner than that of the skin, and the more so the further it proceeds. To this circumstance must be attributed the facility with which divers remarkable modifications are pro- duced through this membrane, when, for the gal- vanizing process, the surface of the tongue is loaded with zinc, the mucous surface of the tunica conjunctiva with another metal, that of the pitui- tary membrane, of the surface of the rectum, of the gums, See., and that these divers metals are brought directly or indirectly into contact.904 EPIDERMOID A L SYSTEM. Wherever the epidermis of the mucous surfaces has been destroyed, it has been rapidly regene- rated. Not possessing either organic or animal sensibility, it is in this respect calculated, as well as in the skin, to protect the subjacent papillae, which are endowed with remarkable sensibility. •/ To its presence also, over the mucous surfaces, must be attributed the faculty they are gifted with, of being exposed to the air, and even to the contact of exterior forms, without exfoliating or inflaming, as in the unnatural anus, prolapsus of the rectum, &c., whilst the serous surfaces will never bear these contacts with impunity. Besides, the nature of the mucous epidermis is similar to the cutaneous : submitted to the action of the same agents, they give the same results. The excrescences which form upon its surface, are per- fectly similar, though not so common; it becomes callous from pressure. Chopart quotes the in- stance of a shepherd in whom the urethra pre- sented this disposition from repeatedly introducing a small rod, for the purpose of indulging his vene- real appetite. The density which this envelope- ment acquires in the stomachs of certain birds, is well known ; in particular instances, where the mucous membranes are forced out, aftd in prolap- sus of the anus, vagina, uterus, &c.: sometimes even then, from the pressure of the dress, this membrane becomes evidently thicker than in its natural state. This is even partly the reason that905 EPIDERMGIDAL SYSTEM. these membranes lose in such cases the bright red colour that characterizes them in the interior. SECTION II.- Epidermis of the deep-seated Mucous Surfaces. In proportion as the mucous surfaces recede from the surface, the epidermis grows thinner, till it is almost imperceptible ; 1st. In the sto- mach, intestines, bladder, the gall-bladder, that for the semen, in all the excretory ducts, &c.; so that it is impossible to attempt to raise it even with the most delicate instrument. 2dly. I heive never observed that the epidermis is raised in the mucous membranes when boiled or mace- rated. 3dly. I have drawn out a portion of the intestines of a dog, and, after having exposed its mucous surface, by dividing it, I have ap- plied an epispastic; the surface assumed a brighter red colour, but no pellicle was raised. 4thly. No excoriations similar to those of the surface of the lips, of the glands, &c., have ever been ob- served in the folds of an artificial anus. 5thly. I have had frequent opportunities of dissecting sub- jects affected with mucous discharges, either acute or chronic, of the intestines, stomach, blad- der, &c., but I never found the epidermis raised by inflammation, as is so often the case in the cutaneous organ, from erysipelas, phlegmon, &c. 6thly. In the deep-seated mucous surfaces, these906 EPIDEIIMOIDAL SYSTEM. excoriations and exfoliations, so often met with on the surface of the body, from a variety of affections, are never detected. From all these considerations it would appear, that there is no epidermis in the deep seated mucous surfaces, and that the abundant quantity of mucous juices constantly poured out by the subjacent glands, act as a substitute to protect the papillae and the corium against the impression of substances foreign to the economy, and con- tained in the internal cavities. There is a cir- cumstance, however, which seems to demon- strate the existence of an epidermis in these parts : I mean the separation of unnatural membranes which might be considered as a kind of exfolia- tion of the epidermis. Many authors have quoted instances of these membranes formed in the blad- der, and expelled through the urinary canal; from the stomach and oesophagus, and expelled by vomiting ; or from the intestines, and expelled with the faeces. Haller has quoted numerous exam- ples of such cases. Dr. Montague informed me that he had^ seen a membrane discharged by vomiting, forming an imperforated sac, similar in every respect to that which lines the internal surface of the stomach. Desault has seen a bag almost similar to the bladder, discharged by a patient afflicted with a retention of urine. I confess that my own observation affords no information on this head, so that I cannot pre-EPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 90? tend to sav what is the nature of these mem- branes ; but authors agree in general in ascribing to them a soft and pulpy nature, which does not appear to accord with that we have described in the epidermis. In the Hotel Dieu, I have often noticed whitish membranes removed from the oesophagus, subsequent to poisoning by nitric acid. But these membranes evidently are the superficial part of the mucous organ, which being disorganized is expelled by the suppuration that has formed under it. It is thus, that the cutane- ous eschars drop in the form of a membrane; thus are formed the osseous sheets in necrossis, and which are nothing more than the surface of the bone that dies, and is separated in a lamellat- ed form. Hence the existence of an epidermis in the deep-seated mucous surfaces appears to me very doubtful, and could not be admitted without further considerations, and those, I think, will prove more against than in favour of this opinion. Where does the epidermis that lines the origin of the mucous surfaces terminate, or if continued throughout, where does its existence cease to be ascertained by the action of the different re- agents ? In my opinion, it is impossible fully to elucidate this question ; this membrane gradually dies away and becomes imperceptible.EPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM* 908 ARTICLE III. Nails. / All the fingers are provided, at their extremi- ties, with hard, transparent, and elastic blades, of a nature similar to that of horns in different animals. SECTION i. r - . • Forms, Extent, Connections, The nails of the human species differ from those of the major part of other animals; first in width, then in their tenuity. In the first respect they are calculated to protect the extremities of the fingers, which are wider than in a number of ani- mals, for the better perfection of touch. In the second, they seem less intended either for attack or defence. The inhabitants of most nations cut their nails on a level with their fingers, so that they do not present in that state their natural strength. Left to nature, they grow by bending in the flexor direction, and completely cover the interior ex- tremity of the finger. This growth has deter- mined limits, which the nail never exceeds, and which this organ has reached when its extremity is sharp and pointed ; but as long as it bears the appearance of a section the nail continues to grow.SPIDERMQiD-AL SYSTEM. 909 The habit of cutting our nails appears to us, in our manners, merely a matter of decency. But if we reflect ever so little on society at large, on the numerous arts originating from its wants, on the perfection, delicacy, precision, and rapid motion the fingers are often called upon to perform, on the necessity of uniting and crossing them in a thousand different directions, &c., that we shall soon be convinced this custom was almost unavoidably brought on by social order; and that what at first appeared to us to proceed from fashion, was an actual want. Man, in a state of nature, only enjoys a coarse and imper- fect touch ; to grasp his food, and the objects for his defence or aggression, &c. and particu- - larly also to climb upon trees, and cling to them for support, was all that was required ; now in this respect his nails were remarkably useful to him. What he has lost in that state seems to have been amply compensated for in society, by the precision, the extent, and the delicacy of his touch. In the former state, his hands were very . active in locomotion, but hardly of any use in this respect ; in the latter state they regain by the partial motion of the fingers what they had lost in respect to total motion, which can the better be dispensed with. In its natural state the nail contains three dis- tinct parts. The posterior part is concealed on both sides by the integuments ; the middle partEPIDE R MOIDAL SYSTEM. 910 is free on one side only ; the other anterior, and detached on both sides. The posterior part of the nail forms nearly a sixth part of its whole extent. Its convex sur- face adheres rather strongly to the epidermis, which, to fix it, is disposed in the following man- ner: after having covered the portion of the finger corresponding to the last joint, it is reflected over the concave border, where the skin ends, and the nail begins to emerge. It commonly surrounds this edge with a kind of small and very distinct thread, in which is a small groove, and which is evidently of the nature of the epidermis, since it admits of being cut without causing pain, and is easily re-produced. After having formed this ridge, which makes a kind of curve, the epi- dermis is again reflected ; insinuates itself between the skin and the nail, and is glued, as it were, to the concave surface, without being confounded together; for it is easily removed by scraping it with the dissecting knife. In this manner the dermis that covers the superior part is actually interposed between two sheets of epidermis. After having thus fixed the nail, and on reaching the posterior edge, the epidermis is continued, even identified with it, which edge, considering its softness and tenu- ity, is rather assimilated to this membranous sheet. Hence it must be inferred, that were it not for the attachment of the epidermis to theepideumoidal system. 911 nail, a kind of bag would be left towards the edo'e. Some authors have stated, that the ex- tensor tendon is continued so far, but it is easy to perceive it does not exceed the tubercle that terminates the back part of the phalynx. The nail does not extend to this tubercle; a space of a quarter of an inch is left between them. The concave surface of the posterior part of the nail corresponds to the same substance as the middle part. This middle part is left exposed in its convex surface, which is smooth and whitish in the back part, where this hue is observed in the form of a half moon, but of a reddish colour in most of its extent, a colour that does not belong to it, but which it borrows from the subjacent tissue. In the sides the skin partly covers this surface, lines it, and terminates by continuing along the con- cave and free surface we have described. Thus the epidermis forms, in this part, a small ridge, which is on each side a continuation of that pre- viously mentioned; then it unites with the nail, and adheres to its lateral ridge, with which it is identified. The concave surface of this middle part is secured in front by the epi- dermis, which, after having lined the extre- mity of the fingers, and on reaching the part where the nail begins to be confined, separates from the dermis, and proceeds to adhere all along912 F.PIDEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. a curved line, and by being subsequently blended with it, appears to form its internal sheet. The dermis, on the contrary, continued over the con- vex part of the last phalynx, assumes there a re- markable consistence, a reddish aspect, a texture % of a pulpy nature, and very distinct from that observed in other parts : it contains more ves- sels ; no areolas are observed; no prolongations shoot from it to the surface of the nail with % which the epidermis forms a body. These threads, the remnants of the lacerated exhalents, and which have been mentioned before, are never met with in this surface: thus no perspiration transudes through the nails ; no oily substance forms on their surface; no watery drops collect over their horny surface. Hence the nails are evidently separated from every other organ except the epi- dermis with which it is continued in its concave surface, and especially in its posterior and lateral edges. When, therefore, this continuity has been destroyed in the sides or behind, the whole nail, though healthy in the middle, soon drops off. The length of the free part of the nail cannot be easily determined. I have never seen Hallow- ed to acquire its natural growth: I have merely observed, that if it be left to grow to some extent, it obviously acquires a greater thickness in the middle than in the posterior parts. The thickness, resist- ance and hardness of the nail, generally increase in913 EPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM* a gradual proportion from the posterior to the anterior part. Let us enquire into the cause of this. SECTION II. Organization, Properties, <$fC, To study the organization of the nail with some degree of accuracy, the largest must be selected, such as those of the great toe or thumb, &c. the convex surface is then evidently seen composed of a single sheet. In the posterior part there is nothing more than this sheet; hence its re- markable tenuity in that part, but as we pro- ceed towards the anterior part, new sheets are seen added in succession in the concave surface,- so that the nail progressively thickens. These laminae are easily removed sheet by sheet, the furthermost are the shortest. Frequently a num- ber of small striae very observable, and all in a longitudinal and parallel direction, and which might almost lead us to suppose them of a fibrous nature are seen; at other times these lines can hardly be traced. What is the nature of these sheets in nails? In my opinion it is almost the same as that of the epidermis. 1st. The most superficial one is evidently continuous with it, and nothing is in- terposed between these two productions. 2dly. I have already observed that the nails drop, and are 3 N VOL. II.914 EP7DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. reproduced precisely in the same manner as the epidermis. They are possessed of two modes of growth ; the one in the longitudinal direction when the ends , are cut, the other in thickness when a single lamina only is removed, which is soon replaced. Whenever a nail drops, the whole of the dermis by which the back of the last pha- lanx is covered, forms a new one from its exter- nal surface. 3dly. The vital powers are equally as obscure in nails as they are in the epidermis, nothing like animal sensibility can ever be traced. The excruciating pains experienced, on their being torn off, exclusively proceed from the sen- sibility of the subjacent pulpy tissue; they may be compared to those produced, by tearing up the hair. There is nothing to be compared with or- ganic sensibility, nothing like interior circulation, and of course no caloric is emitted in the tissue. The horns in animals are nearly of an equal degree of temperature with the atmosphere, whilst other external productions possessed of vital powers in an eminent degree, though shoot- ing the same as horns from the economy retain a degree of temperature equal to that of the body : such are the combs of the European cock, those still more striking of the turkey. Let these pro- ductions be compared with the legs of these species that are covered with scales ; and the deference of temperature will be striking. 4thly. Nails in burning, exhale an offensive smell,similar to that ofEP1DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 915 the epidermis under similar circumstances ; and, as in the epidermis, combustion is kept up by the quantity of oil they contain. 5thly. If mace- ration and boiling do not render the nails less firm and adherent, as when they act upon the epidermis, it is because they are more solid. 6thly. I have obtained from the action of nitric and sulphuric acids, &c., upon these organs, nearly the same results as observed in the epidermis. Every thing then seems to concur to establish the utmost analogy in composition, organization, and properties between the nails and the epider- mis ; most undoubtedly there must exist some distinctions between their respective principles, since their appearances are not the same; since, although several sheets of epidermis are placed together, as in the sole of the foot and palm of the hand, yet the form and texture peculiar to nails is never observed, so that these cannot be considered altogether as mere sheets of epi- dermis applied together. It remains for chy- mistry to mark these differences which must certainly be very slight. Thus is nature often seen using these two organs with equal success for the very same purposes: thus it is, the feet of man and the approaching species, are protected by a thick epidermis, whilst in the cloven-footed species, they are lined with a horny substance, similar to the human nail. As a further and indisputable proof of the defi- 3 n 2916 EPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. ciency of internal motion in the epidermis; in respect to the habitual elaboration of nutrition and decomposition, constituting the insensibility of those organs to the various stimulants, is the facility with which they admit of being im- pregnated with the divers colouring substances, and retain them for such a length of time. In the historical accounts of the various savage tribes, we read that many of them are in the habit of staining their faces, or ■ other parts of the body, nay, even its whole surface, which retains for a considerable time without renewing the application, the colour that has been artifici- ally applied. I have stripped its epidermoidal part from the arm of a corpse, which, during life had in part been dyed blue; this shade not only pre- vailed over the surface of the membrane, but penetrated completely through : still the pores were as visible as before, and prespiration, I suppose, is effected as usual, with the tribes that dye their skin. The pores of linen are never obliterated when it has been dyed, a correct simile, since both the epidermis and nails are actually inorganic bodies. If any organ whatever be exposed and thus dyed, the colour will irritate, and togethe rwith the con- tact of the air, will produce inflammation, which being succeeded by suppuration the colouring mat- ter isexpelled. A similar effect would be produced by the process of nutrition if inflammation were not917 EPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. produced. There is a means, however, which might secure the permanency of the dye, even in organs which being of similar delicacy as the skin, are liable to habitual decomposition ; this mode is to apply the colour with a red hot iron. The let- ters and figures sailors and soldiers stamp upon their skins with a red hot needle for the purpose, and the impression which subsists for such a length of time, is not only seated in the epider- mis, but also in the corium. Development. In the foetus, the skin has not yet receded from its pulpy state, when the nails have already acquired a remarkable degree of consistence: though very thin, their thickness and consistence follow a progressive course with the growth of the foetus. Their length at birth is not propor- tionate to what these organs will subsequently acquire. They never exceed the tip of the fin- ger, but are often shorter; so that, it is only after birth, that these organs acquire that length and curved form, unnecessary in the womb, since the foetus had there nothing to grasp. Owing to their transparency at birth, the dark hue of the blood which first circulated through the arteries,and then the vermilion aspect suddenly acquired by respiration, are very conspicuous through them. In proportion as age advances, these organs in-EPIDERMOTDAL SYSTEM. 918 crease with the epidermis ; but this increase is not attended with any thing particular, and they become remarkably thick in old age. These organs during life, are liable to no other affections, than those which belong to the epi- dermis. They consist of excrescences, irregu- lar developments, and other productions, the nature of which is perfectly similar to that of the tissue of the nails, wherein no more sensi- bility, circulation, caloric, and vitality are observ- able ; a remarkable and distinctive character from those of tumours, originating from other organs gifted with a considerable degree of vita- lity, such, for instance, as the skin, muscles, &c., in which tumours the tissue is perfectly distinct from that of the organs they have originated from, and most generally possessed of quite diffe- rent properties. Thus are excrescences of the epidermis perfectly similar to the epidermis itself.SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. The adjective (Pileux) by which this system is described in French, is derived from the Latin substantive expressive of the organs it is com- posed of. Man is not so generally covered with hair, as most other animals. In respect to the latter, hair forms a kind of coating exterior to skin, upon which the contact of exterior forms being partly lost, leaves a less important part for animal sensibility to perform, and room for less numerous connexions between the subject and ex- terior forms. With them, exterior life of course, is much more limited than with man, in whom the organ of touch is separated by a thin epidermis and a very scanty proportion of hair only, from surrounding objects, the slightest impressions of which are felt; and which on that account, main- tain the animal sensibility in a state of permanent activity. Thus, is man naturally better calculated to derive enjoyment from without. The pleasures attendant upon the act of procreation, and those which relate to digestion, include (exclusive of all others) the enjoyment of brutes. Those ol920 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. man also are partly derived from the same sources ; but a very different order of pleasures, purely in- tellectual, and which solely relate to exterior sen- sations, opens an immense field before him for enjoyments. The hair in man is principally met with upon X the head, some parts of the face, the anterior surface of the trunk, the genital parts, limbs, &c. the form, quantity, and length of these produc- tions varying remarkably. To form to ourselves a correct idea, let us proceed to examine them se- parately, in their respective regions; subsequently, their general organization, properties, and de- velopment, will be considered. ARTICLE I. Study of the System of Hair in the divers Regio?is, This system may be viewed in the head, trunk, and limbs. SECTION i. Hair of the Head. The head is that part of the body wherein the hair is most abundant: the whole cranium is covered with it, and provides it with a kind of pad, by which it is protected from the impression of mechanical injury, as the general hairy skin of921 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. animals protects their body. Hence this part is the least calculated for touch, owing either to this covering, by which animal sensibility is be- numbed, or to its convex form, which limits the contact. The face, in general, contains less, though still in great quantity, particularly in the human spe. cies. In that part wherein most of our means of communicating with exterior forms are con- fined within a very narrow compass, namely, the organs of taste, smell, sight, and hearing, even, but very imperfectly belong to the sense of touch, owing to their position. Even its very form is uncalculated for touch : the mouth which is depressed cannot possibly apply itself to exte- rior forms. Thus, whilst the muzzle, projecting in most of animals, answers the twofold purpose to turn and return them over again in different ways to ascertain their tactile qualities, then to seize them for food, the mouth in man is intended for the latter purpose only ; his hands fulfil the first office. Thus do we find every animal constantly directing his nose towards the earth, even those with clavicles ; whilst in man the mouth is natu- rally calculated for quite a reverse position. Of Hair. Hair occupies in the head the whole space cor- responding with the occipital, the parietal, theSYSTEM Of THE HAIR. 922 squamous part of the temporal, and a small por- tion of the frontal bones. Its limits in the sides never vary, for they always correspond above the ear ; but posteriorly it sometimes extends over the superior part of the neck. On applying blisters in this region, as many varieties in this re- spect are observed as there are subjects, and how very variable these limits are in the forehead is well known. Sometimes extending lower down, or sloping higher up, sometimes tracing a curved line, at other times a complete triangle, the supe- rior point corresponding with the medium line : these limits are never traced with any degree of uniformity. The width or contraction of the forehead is exclusively determined by these irregularities, whilst the different degrees of inclination exclu- sively depend upon the bones. In this respect, hair rather contributes to the expression of the face; I say rather, because it is much less to the width of the forehead than to the direction approaching the perpendicular, that we refer the grand and majestic air we ascribe to gods and heroes. Poets have exercised their muse in describing the crown of Jupiter. It may be remarked in this respect, that there is a great difference between what expresses majesty or abjection in the face, and what proclaims the various passions. It is the bony structure of this region, and the degree of inclination re-923 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. suiting* from it, that fulfil the first use : muscular motion especially concurs to the second, and why ? because grandeur and majesty, &c. are essen- tially connected with the extent of the intellect; that, intellect itself has its seat in the brain, and the varied capacity of the cranium containing this organ, and corresponding with its degrees of development, must of necessity influence the di- vers dimensions of the face. Now, as the osseous structure is permanent, the features will always retain the expression of power or weakness. The passions, on the contrary, by which the epigastric organs are especially affected, and by which sub- sequently the muscles of the face are convulsed, must unavoidably possess nothing more than a fu- gitive expression. In similar surfaces hair varies in an astonishing degree. In some we find the hairs numerous and in close contact, whilst in others, more sparingly disseminated, they suffer the skin to appear; a circumstance depending either upon original formation, or upon diseases that caused their par- tial fall. Like the nails, their growth is limited, but these limits are rather unknown to us ; we have seen them reach to the waist, the thigh, or even to the legs; but in this respect they vary: they appear to grow much longer in females : one might think that nature had thus compensated in the fair sex for their deficiency in many other parts. Waving over the shoulders, breast, trunk, &c..SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. 924 they protect, as it were, from the injuries which might be sustained from air, light, &c. Their ex- tent evidently proves that man was originally in- tended for a vertical position : in fact, in that of quadrupeds they would drag upon the ground, and would impede motion. No animal, I believe, in the creation, experiences from his mane such obstruction as man, from his hair, in a similar direction. Man who changes every thing, has made it a custom in most societies he has formed, of cutting the hair, beard, &c. It is a matter of fashion for the vulgar, but for the physician it is a practice of much greater influence perhaps over the func- tions, than may be supposed. In fact, whenever this system has attained in the natural state its fullest extent, nothing more than the habitual motion of composition and decomposition is ob- servable. In man, on the contrary, when in the habit of cutting it, it remains the seat of these properties and also of growth. By this habit the phenomena belonging to infancy are perpe- tuated, and consequently a more active elabora- tion effected, probably.at the expense of that of many other parts. The difference in the nature of the hair consi- derably influences its length ; lank hair is ge- nerally the longest. The more it curls, the shorter it is, as is exemplified in black and even in white subjects, that have it frizzled like the925 SYSTEM OF THE IIAIH. former, <fcc. These organs are excessively small, yet they are capable, proportionally, of every considerable resistance. No part whatever in the economy, not even the fibrous, can in proportion to the volume, bear such considerable weights. Thus it is that ropes made with hair would be so remarkably strong, if this were of sufficient length to be converted to different uses. The colour of hair varies considerably, accord- ing to the different countries, latitudes, climates, temperature, &c. &c. This colour even, as well as that of the skin, forms one of the characteris- tic attributes of the different human races. Na- turalists have given it a particular consideration ; in this respect I refer to their books. In our climates, the principal colours of hair are black, light, and red. These are, as it were, three general types to which are referred an infinitude of other shades. Around the black ; the brown, auburn, &c. rally: the light includes on the one part the fiery red, and every intermediate shade on the other, down to the light chestnut. The fiery red, linked with the light by one of its shades, represents in the reverse one, the colour natural to peculiar flames. All authors have laid down the colour of hair as a characteristic mark of the temperament. Black hair is the emblem of strength and vigour. An athletic figure with light hair, would appear an object of ridicule. This last shade is theSYSTEM OF THE HAIR. 926 attribute of weakness and indolence. Painters have given it to figures that are not expressive of strong passions, or of great and heroic actions. In voluptuous paintings of the graces, beauty, &c. by adorning the head of youth, this ornament animates the canvas, as it were. The black and the light, including their respective shades, are met with in both sexes nearly in an equal propor- tion. But let us only reflect a moment upon the impressions we receive from the sex, as far as relates to the shade allotted to the individual ab- stractedly from every other consideration, and we shall find, that the female adorned with light hair, forcibly impresses upon us a sense of beauty united to weakness, an irresistible appeal for protection: the very word even by which this subject is described, is expressive of this dou- ble attribute. The phrase of (brune piquante) black-eyed maid, on the contrary, forcibly con- veys an idea of strength and beauty united. Beauty then, is an attracting gift which females enjoy in common, but which being variously mo- dified by exterior forms, entice and attract either by interesting our feelings, or by exciting them, &c. Languid eyes are frequently associated with light hair, whilst the black is generally the ap- pendage of a sparkling eye, the vivacity of which seems to denote an excess of vitality ready to break loose from its bounds. Custom which influences every thing, changesSYSTEM OF THE HaIK. 927 our taste for the colour of the hair as for that of dress. The black, the light, and their numerous i shades, prevail in turn ; and as organization can- not so very readily accommodate our fancy, arti- ficial head-dresses have been resorted to; an in- genious invention undoubtedly calculated to bend to our whims the invariable course of nature, and which, by altering at will, that expression which physiognomy borrows from the hair, the wearer may in the course of two minutes appear in the height of fashion to-day, and perfectly ridiculous to-morrow. Now, amidst all these rapid changes in respect to hair, the deep red, and its different shades, are never admitted. Many people ex- press an unequivocal aversion to this colour. We almost consider it as a mal-formation. This opinion is too generally extended not to be sup ported on some solid ground.. The most essen- tial appears to me, the common consent exist- ing between this hair and the constitution, and consequently the nature of the temper resulting from it ; now the temper associated to this colour of hair, is not commonly the most eligible in spite of the numerous exceptions recorded by proverbs. Another motive for objecting to this fiery colour, is, that the oily substances they \ are lubricated with, often exhale an offensive smell, which the other colours do not possess. What connexion can possibly exist between the hair and disposition of individuals ? Is the latter928 SYSTEM OF THE 11AIK. ever influenced by the former? Never; it may be explained as follows : Every individual is pos- sessed of his own peculiar mode of organization and constitution. From this mode the temper results ; but to each mode is attached, on the one part, such and such a species of hair; on the other, the predominance of such and such internal vis- cera, which, though less striking, is still real. This predominance evidently establishes a particular tendency to certain passions, which form the es- sential attributes of the temper: then the colour of the hair and this are two different results pro- ceeding from the very same cause; namely, from the constitution ; but the one is never influenced by the other, &c. The hairs, on emerging from the cutaneous pores, assume such a direction, that those of the anterior part of the cranium almost invariably pass obliquely forwards, and tend to drop over the forehead; those of the middle, and to some extent, of the posterior part, follow a perpendicular direction; and, finally, those of the remainder, of the posterior and inferior part, cross obliquely, so as to produce a natural fall along the posterior part of the neck. The same remark applies to the side of the head in which, as much from direc- tion as from its weight, they fall over the ear and cover that organ.929 SYSTEM OF TFIE HAIR. Eyebrows. Over the arch which completes the orbit, a quantity of hair, more or less abundant, tracing part of a circle, shading the eye, and protecting this organ from the too powerful impression of luminous beams, is observed. In persons of a dark complexion, the hairs of the eyebrows are placed closer together than in such as are fair: more abundant inward, the two eyebrows are sometimes joined together and shade the root of the nose. More sparingly scattered toward the ends, they terminate into a point, and all are directed outwardly; sometimes to- wards the internal part these organs assume a straight direction ; they hardly ever exceed half an inch in length, excepting in some extraordinary cases. The colour in general is similar to that of the hair, but it sometimes varies; they are firmer, more resistant than these, and are larger; if they were longer they would curl like those about the organs of generation, the nature of which they partake. The eyebrows have evidently two distinct motions, 1st. They may be depressed, and drawn inward, forming an obvious arch over the eye. 2ndly. They may be raised and separated by ex- panding the circle of the orbit. The distance be- tween these two reverse motions nearly measures 3 o VOL. II.SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. 930 an inch. The former of these motions is intend- ed to protect the eye from too much light: it is also expressive of mournful and sorrowful passions. Those of a sanguine and choleric disposition, which most frequently give rise to the expression of frowning, are precisely the most hairy; the latter motion is intended to concentrate more light; it allows us to elevate considerably the upper eyelid, to open the eye wider, which was evi- dently prevented by the former : it also expresses the pleasing sensations, those which dilate the features; painters have paid much more attention than anatomists to the varied positions of the eyebrows. Eyelashes. Each eyelid has a thin row of hair, rather longer than that of the eyebrows, of a similar nature, inclined obliquely forwards, crossed to- gether when these moveable veils are closed, and intended to protect the eye from the impression of substances floating in the air. In general these hairs do not curl, but when this happens to be the case, and they are bent towards the eye, irritation ensues, and they must be cut. Some- times a wrong direction causes the irritation. In respect to the eyelashes, I have remarked that all the orifices of interior communications, such as those of the external auditory canal, of the nose and anus, and frequently also those of the931 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. nipple, are surrounded with a certain quantity of hair which protects them from exterior forms. Round the mouth the beard is a substitute for it; the urethra has none, for the prepuce protects that orifice. Beard. In most classes of animals the male is distin- guished from the female by some exterior pro- duction or other. The comb of the cock, the mane of the lion, the horns of deer, &c. are examples of these distinctive characters. In man the beard is the attribute of the male: it covers the chin, the sides of the face, both lips, and the upper part of the neck, leaving the cheeks and the surrounding parts of the eyes bare: hence those parts which serve to express passions would be concealed by the hair if it were allowed to cover the lower part of the face. Although the hairs of the beard are gene*- rally shorter than those of the head, yet they are longer than similar productions on the body. They are usually the same colour as the former, but somewhat darker, and have more of the red cast, which is frequently conjoined to light hair. The hairs of the beard are of a similar nature, as those on the organs of generation, eyebrows, &c. They curl, are stronger, and are more resistant 3 o <2932 SYSTEM OF TITE HAIR. and invariably less oily than those of the head. The fulness of the beard varies very considerably in different individuals. Strength and power, in general, are the properties of those in whom it abounds and assumes a very deep black. It may also be remarked, that in the different species of animals, the strongest males are those in which this exterior production, by which they are dis- tinguished from the female, is the most perfect. This characteristic may be said to indicate the energy or weakness of their constitution. A small lion is never seen with a large mane: large horns always belong to a fine deer; long and strongly twisted ones to a well built ram. The same observation is not applicable to the other hairs common to both sexes : those of the arms, thighs, &c. are often quite as large, and even more numerous, in a weak than in a muscular subject. The habit of shaving, as in most parts of Europe ; of wearing it long, as in Asia ; of plait- ing it, as in China, gives to the face various ex- pressions, by which each nation is characterised. A manly, and characteristic physiognomy, ex- pressive of powers and energy, cannot be de- prived of this exterior covering without losing a part of that character. That of the eastern na- tions coincides with their natural vigour, and forms a contrast with the effeminacy of their habits. I am rather inclined to think, that on perusing the history of the people of differentSYSTEM OF THE HAIR. 933 nations that suffer their beard to grow, and of those who are in the habit of shaving it off, we should be induced to believe that the muscular power is in some degree connected with it, and that part of that power is in some measure lost by the habit of shaving. Every body knows how very powerful the ancients were, how strong were the nations that wore long beards, how very strong again were a particular order of monks who by some monastic law were compelled to wear long beards. A multiplicity of causes may certainly connect weakness with the beard; but in a general point of view I believe that some connection may be admitted between the powers and the beard. Deprive the cock of its comb, which, in respect to this part of the fea- thered creation, is the attribute of the male, as the beard is that of man, and he becomes in some degree more languid. I am convinced that the lion would lose part of his strength if he were deprived of his mane. The result of the experi- ments tried by Russell on the castration of deer are sufficiently known ; after this operation their horns either grew in an irregular manner or ceased to shoot forth. This exterior attribute of the male in this species manifests itself towards the period of virility, when the powers increase. The same observation applies to the human beard. This single coincidence would be sufficient to prove that the latter was intended as an934. SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. exterior character of the masculine sex. Eunuchs, remarkable for a weakness of powers, frequently lose part of their beard. Such are our prejudices respecting the ideas we have formed to ourselves of beauty, that we con- sider ridiculous that which is really beautiful, for whatever proves organic perfection must un- doubtedly be such; a male peacock deprived of the emerald plumage of its tail, a ram robbed of its horns, a deer that has lost them, have something displeasing ; why then should not a man, deprived of his beard, produce a similar feeling ? section ii. • . « System of the Hair on the Trunk. m These productions in the trunk vary most astonishingly. Some men are almost completely hairy, whilst others have hardly any hair at all. Generally speaking, the fore part of the body contains much more than the back part; in men they are particularly met with all along the me- dian line and upon the chest. Women have none on the latter part, and but few on the trunk. In both sexes a considerable quantity shades the genital parts. Less frequently light than the hair, as frequently red, but generally found black, next to those of the beard, they are the longest, and they follow no general direction.

Their blackness and abundance coincides in general with strength. section in. System of the Hair in the Limbs. In man, the whole surface of the limbs is covered with numberless hairs, the proportion is nearly the same in all, but they vary considerably in length. In some they form a real down, in others they are rather longer, and in others again they are nearly an inch in length, laying over each other, and give to the limbs a hairy aspect. In the upper part of the superior limbs, within the arm-pit, we find a mass of hair rather longer than in other parts, and nearly of a similar nature to those of the genital parts. Nothing similar to this is ever met with in the inferior extremities. In many subjects no hair is met with in the internal part of the arm and fore arm ; the sides and back only are seen to contain some: Hair is more uniformly distributed in the inferior extre- mities. It is always met with on the back of the hand and foot, but never in the sole and palm— an essential advantage to the touch.SYSTEM OF THE HAIR* 936 ARTICLE II. Organization of the Hair. However much the hair may vary in respect to form, length, and position of every description, its organization is the same in all, and we will now proceed to examine it in a general light. Chirai, Malpighy, and all anatomists since their time, have described the structure of hair with a tolerable degree of accuracy in some respects, and very imperfectly in others. The following observations are the result of the most scrupulous dissection. SECTION i. Origin of the Hair. Hair generally arises amidst the sub-cutaneous fat, or in the cellular tissue of the parts that are deprived of this fluid. Every individual hair is inclosed at its origin in a kind of small mem- braneous canal, with the nature of which I am totally unacquainted, and through the transparent parietes of which the hair is evidently seen, on being carefully cleared of the surrounding parts. This small cylindrical canal is continued with the hair as far as the cor- responding pores of the skin; it insinuates itself through that pore, and extends as far as the epi- dermis, where it stops, identifying itself with theSYSTEM OF THE IIAIK. 937 tissue of this membrane. The extent of this canal, and consequently that of the course of the hair, either under or in the skin, measure nearly five lines in the hair of the head. No adherence whatever exists between the hair and the internal surface of that canal, except in the swollen basis of the former, where it seems to receive its nutrition. Thus, by opening the canal in this part, and by destroying the adhesion, the hair is left free, and may be drawn out with the utmost facility, by seizing with tweezers the swollen part. By this mode of operating, the tube is left free. By adopting this mode, I have dissected and separated, in a surface of two inches, a considerable number of these tubes, which, when nothing else was left on the internal surface of the skin, appeared like so many small extensions of this organ. Do vessels and nerves reach this cylindrical bag containing the root of the hair ? Prolonga- tions are actually seen extending as far as the external surface, particularly towards the part farthest from the skin; but we do not learn from dissection what is the nature of these extentions. I never succeeded in following them down to a neighbouring nerve or vessel. Although Haller quotes several authors who have traced nerves up to the origin of the hair, he has himself not been more successful. I presume, however, that these prolongations are essentially vascular. Is there938 SYSTEM GF TIIE IIAIH. any kind of fluid contained between the root of the hair and its envelopment ? None whatever flows when the latter is divided, although several authors have pretended the reverse. Besides, if this fluid is in the form of a dew, as upon the serous surfaces, it would not be perceived the hair shoots from the small cylindrical bag I have just mentioned. In the end, a small swelling, some- times hardly perceptible, at other times more so, although less considerable than has been said, is observable. This swelling is of the same nature and hue as the hair itself: it adheres to the tubes probably by the vessels, and, perhaps, by the nerves it receives from it. The hair that shoots from it crosses the canal without adhering, as I have said before, to its parietes, passes along with it through the oblique pores of the dermis, forsakes it in the epidermis, and projects outwardly. All authors have pretended that the epidermis was not perforated by the hair, but merely ele- vated and converted into a sheath that attends it the whole of the length. This assertion is incor- rect. In fact; 1st. The hair is quite as thick within the canal, from whence it emerges, as it is without it. 2dly. This canal being open at the extremity opposed to the skin, the whole hair is easily withdrawn, as I have said before, and without experiencing the slightest resistance, which would otherwise unavoidably be the case. In lacerating the fold of the epidermis, it appears939 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. that, beginning from its swollen end, the hair is completely free, both in the subcutaneous canal, through the skin, or even in crossing the epider- mis. 3dly. If the cutaneous epidermis were actu- ally raised to invest the hair, the thickness of this last production would unavoidably be trebled, unless this epidermis was prodigiously thin. 4thly. Nothing similar to this sheath is ever observed on drawing out the hair; a depression, on the con- trary, is observed on the part. The cutaneous epidermis, then, contributes nothing to the forma- tion of hair, although its nature is partly identified with that of the hair, and its structure should be considered as entirely uniform from one end to the other. Under, within, and out of the skin, the hair is composed of two distinct parts, the one exter- nal, which forms a tube from the swollen part of the dermis up to the end; the other internal, forming the marrow, as it were, the nature of which is unknown. SECTION II. External covering of Hair, This appears to be of the same nature as the epidermis : it has, in fact, all the attributes of the latter. 1st. In burning, the hair exactly resembles the epideiftnis; it then exhales a similar smell, leaving, after combustion, a residue similar to thatSYSTEM OF THE Ii/UK. 910 of the latter. Now, these phenomena are princi- pally derived from their external part. 2dly. Hair is most easily impregnated with water; hence the possibility of using it to great advantage in hygrometers. The epidermis admits of it also; and the hair damped by foggy weather presents, in this respect, a phenomenon analogous to that of the epidermis, softened, wrinkled, and whitened by the contact of a poultice. 3dly. It is owing to this covering that hair is not connected with life, nor possessed of sensibility, and is never the seat of any kind of acute or chronic affection; 4thly. Whatever may be the colour of the hair, this envelopment is invariably white : it is the internal marrow that is the cause of colour: thus it is there is but little difference between the epi- dermis of black and that of white subjects ; hence, whenever the internal substance of the hair has disappeared, the canal only being left, it is more or less white. 5thly. In this state, although the interior of the hair is dead, the exterior epi- dermis, which is independent of it, most com- monly retains the power of growing again when cut; thus, the cutaneous epidermis does not actu- ally interfere with all the diseases subjacent to the skin. Cthly. I presume that it is owing to this part that the hair may be kept so long uninjured. Whenever these organs are screened from the contact of air, centuries may revolve without their being decayed; they do not possess witliii94 i . SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. themselves the principle of decomposition peculiar to all other animal substances. They never rot, either when exposed to air or immersed in water. Thus have we already seen that the cutaneous epi- dermis is found perfect long after the subjacent parts have become putrid. It appears, however, that hair is more incorrup- tible than the epidermis, and even that there is a difference between their respective natures. In fact, 1st. Maceration and ebullition, by which the epidermis is rendered more liable to be torn, though it softens it but very indifferently, leave to the hair its usual degree of resistance, unless carried to such extent as I have not tried. This observation is obvious on comparing them when submitted to those processes. 2dly. Acids and alkalies have a less powerful action upon hair than upon this membrane; but it is dissolved by alkalies with as much and even more facility. 3dly. With due compensation for thickness, a shred of the epidermis is infinitely less resistant than a hair. 4thly. The hair, as well as the epidermis, * may be dyed of divers colours ; but the colour is less durable, and the process requires to be often renewed. Some modern authors have stated that a kind of exfoliation in the form of a ring is separated from the exterior of the hair, but this is not correct. The experiment however described by Fourcroy, and which consists in rubbing a hair942 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR- between the fingers, a kind of hair rises on the linger in the direction from bottom to top. This experiment, I say, seems to prove the existence of these imperceptible extentions, which contri- bute so much to attach the hairs together, so that when it has remained long uncombed, it cannot be dressed without great difficulty. Sometimes the ends of the hair evidently split. The difference of its nature depends upon the thickness of its sheath ; thick and dense over the genital parts, on the chin, &c., it is less susceptible of being permeated with water, and is therefore more elastic, and more curly. Thin and loose hair is smoother and is more under the in- fluence of the atmosphere. It is from the peculiar nature of its envelopment that the hair of the black subject derives its distinctive character. From what has been stated it follows, that the external part of hair is essentially inert, and quite unconnected with life : we shall find it quite different with the internal surface. section in. Internal Substance of Hair. This substance acts a very important part; it, is this which essentially characterizes the hair, which I would otherwise have included in the system of the epidermis, if, as when the hair be- comes white, this substance formed no part of it.SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. 943 We are quite ignorant of the nature of this internal substance, it is however to be presumed, that it is composed of the most minute vessels, in- closed by the common envelope of the epidermis, and containing the colouring substance which stag- nates in these vessels, or at least only undergoes a slow process of nutrition. Amongst these vessels, are there any, which, as is observed in the skin, open outwardly to expel fluids? Several physi- ologists, have conceived that there are, and in this respect, they have considered the hairs as ac- tual emunctories. I do not believe such opinions are supported by any anatomical fact ; but the plica polonica, a very singular disease, in which blood flows from the hair on its being cut, clearly proves that these productions contained exhalents in the natural state, and which being dilated by the disease, contain a fluid, before foreign to them. It is besides beyond a question, that the ex- halents of this system, much less active than those of the skin, cannot so effectually serve as an emunctory. What has been related respect- ing absorption from the vessels of the hair, I con- sider as wholly without foundation. From this statement respecting the internal substance of hair, it appears to be grounded upon analogy with the rete mucosam of the skin, and like this, it results from two different species of vessels, in some of which the colouring sub- stance stagnates, others giving exit to fluids, in944 SYSTEM OF THE IIAIR. particular cases, and consequently effecting a kind of circulation. The colouring substance of the hair bears some analogy with that of the skin. Thus we remark, that both are in general darker in hot climates, and nearer to the line; thus red hair often coincides with the yellow freckles observed in the skin of certain persons, in whom the epi- dermis was raised either by erysipelas or by blis- tering. In blacks, the colour of the hair, however, is sooner changed by acids than that of the skin. The muriatic acid first whitens the hair, which turns yellow on drying ; the nitric acid gives it a yellowish aspect; the sulphuric leaves it com- pletely black. What is most important, however, in the internal surface of hair, is the actual vitality it enjoys, and by which it is made perfectly distinct from the external envelope. To this character the following phenomenon should be attributed. 1st. The different passions have a remarkable influence over the internal substance of the hair. In a very short space of time, grief will often alter its colour, and convert it into white, un- doubtedly by causing the fluid of the small capillary vessels to be absorbed. Many authors who have quoted these facts, amongst whom Haller ranks the first, have questioned it. But I have myself seen five or six cases, in which the hair was deprived of its colour within a week. In945 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. the course of one night the hair of an acquaint- ance of mine turned almost completely white on receiving some fatal intelligence. In these revolutions, the epidermis remains unaltered, retains its texture, nature, and properties; the internal substance only is vitiated. It is said, that fright will make the hair stand upright. Painters have even resorted to this in order to express terror. How far this opinion is correct I am not prepared to state, but it is too gene- rally received to be only imaginary. Now, if fear has so powerful an effect upon the hair; if it actually produces motion, should we be surprized that pain and grief should suddenly change the fluids contained in these productions, and even deprive them of these fluids ? 2ndly. The plica polonica, I have just adverted to, in which the hairs on being cut, or even without it, emit a bloody fluid, and acquire a re- markable excess of vitality, evidently exists with- in the internal substance, the external part has nothing to do with it. Some authors have even asserted that this internal substance sometimes ac- quires a fleshy nature as it were: then the exter- nal part exfoliates. The danger attendant upon cutting hair after some acute diseases is sufficiently known. I have myself witnessed a fatal instance of it, and many others have been quoted by several physicians, by Lanoix in particular. Now from what do these vol. ir. 3 pSYSTEM OF THE HAIR. 946 accidents proceed? Certainly not from the con- tact of air, from which the head is secured by these organs; for these accidents will occur although the head is covered. It cannot proceed from the growth of the cropped hair attracting to these parts an exuberance of vital activity in which the internal viscera speedily sympathise: hence the headache, diseases of the eyes, &c. no- ticed in these instances. It is a kind of active sym- pathy of the hair upon the viscera: now every organ that sympathises is endowed with actual vitality, and most obviously enjoys very distinct vital powers. The epidermis never sympathises,because this membrane is nearly inert, is hardly organized, is not on a par with the other organs, and conse- quently cannot possibly correspond with them. The danger attending the cutting of hair after serious diseases affords me the opportunity of observing, that the cleaning of children’s heads in those diseases is not always unattended with danger. I have instanced several cases of danger- ous consequences proceeding from this cause. 4thly. Not only the other systems influence that of the hair, but are also influenced by it; this is often observed after acute diseases, in which the roots sympathetically reject the fluids by which they are nourished, and being dried up fall off. It may be remarked that this fall of the hair very seldom coincides with the exfoliation of the epidermis ; which most evidently provesSYSTEM OF THE IIA IK. 947 that the opinion generally admitted respecting the origin of the external portion of the hair is quite incorrect, and that although perfectly ana- logous to the epidermis, this, as I have said, does not arise from it. 5thly. The hair of many animals falls off at certain seasons, and is afterwards regenerated : now the period of its re-production is marked by numerous diseases, and almost invariably by a loss of power. We might be induced to suppose that the nutritive elaboration, which in this in- stance attracts an excess of vital powers, lessens these powers in other regions. Man is not like birds, a number of quadrupeds, reptiles, &c. liable to an annual renewal of these external pro- ductions : it is a cause nevertheless for disease. In fact, it cannot be doubted that in the social state a variety of causes would as often have affected these re-productions as they give rise to disorders of the periodical discharge, &c. 6thly. Cold and heat will also frequently affect the internal substance of hair. We know, that in certain quadrupeds, as rabbits, hares, &c. the hair whitens in winter, and re-assumes its primi- tive colour in summer. 7thly. Shortly after having dyed the hair black, a custom more prevalent in France than when powder was used, headaches were frequently felt: a swelling in the scalp was very common, H 3 p 2948 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. although the skin was not at all concerned, and the hair alone had been affected. From all this it naturally follows, that the hair, similar to the epidermis in its external covering, and so far inert, differs from it in its internal substance, which, as 1 have already stated, is very imperfectly known. A further proof of this assertion is, that the phenomena I have stated, and to which many more might be added, are never observed when the hair, having turned white, retains nothing more than its external epidermis, the internal substance having disap- peared. This is proved by daily observation. It might happen, however, in this instance, that that part only of this internal substance corre- sponding with the colour, might chance to disap- pear, and that containing the seat of exhalation continue to live as usual; and in this respect white hairs might undergo the changes of living matter : of this, however, I think but few in- stances could be produced. All this besides must be subordinate to further experiments, which will, undoubtedly, at some further period, cast more light upon this system. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Hair. On being exposed to caloric, they are but slightly contracted; they twist in divers ways; rSYSTEM OF THE HAIR. 949 but this proceeds from quite a different cause of contraction in other organs. The moisture which the hair naturally contains is evaporated by caloric, and the particles drawn nearer together: hence, when the hair is damped again by a fog, bath, atmospheric air, &c., it uncurls and becomes lank. The greasy substances these organs are imbued with on dressing the hair, provides them with a coating impermeable to water, maintains the head-dress, and prevents its imbibing this fluid. After it is washed the hair will sooner curl, as has often been observed since it was the fashion to wear it short, This at first sight seems a paradox ; it is not so however. In fact, by carefully rubbing the hair, the unctuous fluid it was covered with is removed, or it combines with the soap-suds used for that purpose ; by this means it easily penetrates the hair when the pores are left free, and afterwards by evapo- rating together with the fluids it already contain- ed, an effect that was prevented by the unctuous substance, it is dryer and therefore more disposed to curl. As a further proof that it is the epidermoidal sheath of hair that imbibes the humidity which it loses when after being curled, it droops, is that a detached portion of the epidermis will also curl on being twisted with curling tongs, and then restored again to its natural state if immersed in water.950 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. The extensibility and contractility of the tissue are very obscure in hair ; it is its resisting quality that prevents fracture; it hardly admits of ex- tension. When drawn out no animal sensibility is ob- servable, the pain resulting from it proceeding from the skin which it crosses : hence, by draw- ing a hair in a reverse direction, pain is more se- vere than by drawing it in the sense of the pores. I do not, however, pretend to deny that the exten- sions by which their roots are fixed to the adjacent parts may not also be the cause of the pain caused by this extension. These organs are not gifted with animal contractility. The internal substance of hair evidently pos- sesses organic properties. The different changes this substance undergoes can only proceed from au alteration of these properties. In the plica polonica, the organic sensibility and insensible contractility are increased to the utmost degree. To attain this degree of energy then, these pro- perties must necessarily have existed in the na- tural state. These are the two properties that the sympathies we have adverted to bring into play. This system does not possess organic sen- sibility. We cannot deny, however, that in their natural state these organs, after the epidermis and nails, are those in which life is less active, those which are the least connected with the other organs;SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. 951 w hilst most of the other systems are affected by any disease, this remains in its natural state, and continues to grow as usual. It evidently then possesses a mode of being perfectly distinct from that of other parts. In general, the external production of animals, such as feathers, hairs, scales, &c. appear to form a class of organs quite unconnected with the life of the internal organ ; they may be compared to the different species of moss that are attached to the bark of trees, without being an essential part of the whole. ARTICLE IV. SECTION I. Development of the Hair ; State of the System " in early Life. In the early months of conception, the gelatinous skin of the foetus contains no hair. It is towards the period when the fibres of the dermis begin to form a light down, that it is observed to form. This down is of a whitish appearance, and is concealed under that greasy and unctuous substance that is found upon the surface of the skin at an early period. Soon after, this down, which seems to be nothing more than the external portion of the hair, and which is then remarkably thin, be- gins to assume a dark or light aspect, according952 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. to the colour that will subsequently prevail, and which is owing' to the internal substance. The hue remains light until after birth. At this period the hair of the head is often more than half an inch in length, while upon the remainder of the body nothing but down, a fore-runner of hair, is observable, particularly in the face. The hair of the head then appears some time before that on other parts of the body. Subsequent to birth, the growth of hair is much more rapid than previous to it. In this re- spect it is quite different from most of the other parts, which are much more rapidly developed in the womb. During infancy, it is of a lighter colour than when the body has attained maturity. The light colour acquires more of the auburn cast, and the dark and red become more intense, until to- wards the twenty-sixth or the thirtieth year. The lighter shades are in respect to the system of the hair, what the deficiency of energy in forms is to the muscular cellular systems, &c. Frequently that which will subsequently prove light, bears a whitish appearance, which colour proceeds solely from the nature of the internal substance, and not from a deficiency of this substance, as in old age. Thus the white of the Albinos also proceeds from the particular nature of this substance. This system is not completely developed in youth.SYSTEM OF THE HAIK. 953 SECTION llw State of this System in the subsequent Stages. At the age of puberty this system undergoes a remarkable change, and is nearly doubled; hair forms upon the genital parts and the beard ; a characteristic mark of the male in the hu- man species also begins to appear. One might think a similar consent exists between the hair of the testis and the beard, as that observed between the testis and the organ of the voice, or that between the uterus and the breasts. The beard is, in this respect, an external emblem of virility. A short time previous to its eruption, the bag, from which the hair originates, is observed under the skin; it is already evidently formed, and discloses the rudiment of the organ it is intended to contain, as I have frequently noticed. Thus the follicle of the tooth is in existence Jong before this organ emerges. At the same time the hair in the arm-pit is also observed to grow, that of the trunk and limbs, hardly removed from the state of down, assumes more consistence and a determined shade, and becomes more abundant. To enquire why puberty occasions such a general increase in this system, would be to seek for the cause of all the other phenomena peculiar954 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. to that epoch. I have remarked that the hair of the head, the eyebrows, eyelids, and the hair round the orifices, are the least affected by this revolution. This increase besides, is effected gra- dually : the beard requires two or three years to attain its perfect and permanent state. In the subsequent stages, this system undergoes but very little change, the hair grows again as soon as it is cut, and is therefore the seat of an habitual elaboration. It may be remarked that this elaboration, and consequently the growth of hair, is more rapid in summer, when the cutaneous organ is particularly active; an additional proof of the actual vitality of the organic powers of the internal substance of hair. / 4 SECTION III. State of this System in Old Age. Towards the decline of life, the system of the hair feels the influence of the general obliteration that occurs in almost all the exterior vessels: it first ceases to be supplied with the colouring substance. The internal substance dies, and the external part only remains \ the hair of the head turns white ; that of the beard, and upon the genital organs, dies in turn. Besides, in man, this admits of innumerable varieties : in some men this phenomenon begins at the age of thirty, and even before ; in others at forty, fifty, or sixty.SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. 95h A multiplicity of causes, originating from our passions, affections of the mind, diseases, food, &c., will, in the social state, produce this prema- ture death so frequently observed in a number of men, but exclusively attendant upon extreme old age in other parts of the animal creation less exposed than we are, by the constant uniformity of their life, to similar revolutions. At an uncertain period after the hair has be- come white it falls off; then the small bag which contained the root is obliterated by degrees, and finally disappears. I have examined several bald heads minutely: the skin of the cranium was remarkably smooth in the internal surface; al- though it had been cleared of the cellular tissue, not one of the numerous prolongations formed by the ducts can possibly be traced after the hair they contained has been torn off. I have also / dissected a subject who had become completely bald in consequence of a putrid fever ; all the small tubes were left perfectly unimpaired, and in the bottom even the rudiments of new hair were already observable. There is a difference then be- tween the fall of the hair in old age, and that proceeding from disease; in the former case every thing dies, because the vessels which pro- duce the root cease to supply it with fluids, whilst in the latter case the hair only falls, and the bag remains healthy. It is an opinion rather generally received, that956 SYSTEM OF THE HA 111. the hair, nails, and epidermis, continue to grow after death. I am rather inclined to believe that we are somewhat destitute of proofs respecting this singular phenomenon. I can affirm, however, that I have instanced an actual extension in the beard of a head I had carefully shaved, and which I had submitted to maceration in a cellar during a whole week. An attendant in the dissecting rooms who had prepared a number of heads for skeletons, assured me he had often made a similar remark when the progress of putrefaction was prevented for some space of time. Another po- sitive fact is, that the growth of the beard is not in a direct ratio with the vital powers ; in diseases by which these powers are depressed, it grows as much as in those characterized by a general in- crease of these powers. This is often observed in hospitals, where the effects of an inflammatory fever, a putrid, a slow nervous one, Ac. may often be compared. Why should not the hair also retain after general death sufficient power to grow, since the lymphatic vessels retain sufficient to absorb, &c. The different changes which the hair, epider- mis, skin, and in general all the exterior organs, undergo by age, proceed entirely from those of the internal organs, from the laws that over-rule nu- trition, and not from the action of exterior bodies upon these organs. This forms an important distinction between organic bodies and thoseSYSTEM OF THE HAIR. 957 which are not. The latter have two different ways of wasting by the contact of exterior forms. 1st. Mechanically, by rubbing, tearing, &c. &c. 2dly. Chymically, by combining with substances, such, for instance, as air, the divers principles of which admit of being combined in a thousand different ways, by which both its nature and that of the different forms it comes in contact with are changed. All inorganic bodies grow old in this sense of the word. After a certain time they lose their former appearance. Let us only observe our public buildings, stuffs of every description, paintings, engravings, grounds, me- tals, stones, &c. &c., everything, in short, which in the arts, manufactures, commerce, sciences, and necessaries of life, are composed of inert substances, whether these substances have never been animated, or having enjoyed life, could not exist without it, as the solid parts of the vege- table creation, the bones, horns, hair of animals, &c. ; everything in nature, in short, must ulti- mately bear the marks of the rude hand of time ; everything grows superannuated, is stripped of its original lively appearance ; everything outwardly decays, as well in inert as in organized bodies; but, as the surrounding forms only have acted in respect to the former, the inward part has still retained its youth when the exterior is already old, it I may be allowed these two improper expressions.SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. 958 Thus, we find that the massy rock, the exterior of which, blackened by time, still retains in- wardly the appearance it was possessed of in the very early days of the creation; internal organs, on the contrary, both in animals and vegetables, will decay in the progress of time. Age stamps the internal as well as the external organs with marks of decay. Surrounding bodies act effec- tually upon us; they actually impair life, as it were; but they act as stimulants, by exhausting sensibility and contractility, and not by combin- ing from mechanical contact and friction. The tongue is sufficient to make this distinction ob- vious. At the sight of a new building, of a new dress, of a landscape newly painted, the expres- sion of youth is never used. Why, then, do we say—an old building, an old stuff, &c. ? These expressions may pass as metaphors, but they can- not possibly express a state similar, by its nature, to that of an old animal, of an old plant, &c. SECTION IV. Accidental Development. There are three cases in which hair is acciden- tally formed in the economy. 1st. Sometimes it is detected in the internal surface of the mucous membranes : of this the bladder, stohiach, and intestines, have afforded instances. I have myself witnessed some in theSYSTEM OF THE HAIR. „ 959 stone of the kidney. In one instance, I observed nearly a dozen, an inch in length, in the gall- bladder, and evidently implanted on its surface. 2dly. Unnatural quantities are sometimes de- tected in the skin. They are generally seen to shade those productions or irregular excrescences, termed moles. A mendicant, a few years past, was publicly exhibited at Paris, whose face had from infancy been covered with hair, similar, in some degree, to the bristles of a boar. At thirty- six years of age, this subject was affected with that peculiar species of elephantiasis, by which the face, being swollen, gave to its head the ap- pearance of that of a lion, and to his deformed features a degree of ferocity more easily conceived than described. A variety of stories circulated in the humble walks of society, about men with the head of a boar, of a bear, &c., have arisen from nothing more than these exuberant productions shaded with hair, and which have invaded the features. i 3dly. Hair is often seen to form accidentally in cysts, in those of the ovaries in particular. Many instances of this are quoted, particularly by Haller. I have myself seen two: they represented rather a voluminous bag, containing a number of small very distinct balls, similar to the excrement of sheep, formed of an unctuous, greasy, whitish substance, bearing a very distinct aspect from common fat. In the internal surface of this bag960 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. several hairs were implanted, yielding’ to the slightest attempt, because they penetrated no deeper than the surface. These hairs were black, and several of them, already detached, were in- termixed, in various directions, with the small balls of a greasy matter, like a dispose, for it bore more resemblance to the substance into ■ which fat is converted by maceration.

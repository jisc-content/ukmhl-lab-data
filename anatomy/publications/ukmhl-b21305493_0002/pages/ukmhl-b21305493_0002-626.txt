SEKOUb SYSTEM. 584 SECTION I. Free Surface of the Serous Membranes. Every vserous membrane has one of its two surfaces free, the other adhering to the adjacent organ. . The first is remarkable for its polish, which forms a character that especially distin- guishes this system as well as the following, from every other membrane. Every organ that offers this disposition is indebted for it to the envelope- ment from whence it is borrowed. The liver ceases to be smooth and shining in its diaphragm- atic side where the peritoneum forsakes it. There exists in this respect a considerable difference in the aspect of the anterior surface and the posterior part of the coecum. The bladder is rough wherever it is deprived of the peritoneal covering. The cartilages of the ribs have not the polish of those of the articulations invested by the synovial membrane, &c. Does this remarkable property of the serous membranes arise from the compression they undergo? their situation, in parts exposed to continual friction, leads us to believe so. Bordeu has asserted it, when he said â€œ all the parts of the abdomen are originally irnmerged in cellular tissue, which is subsequently converted into mem- branes by compressionso that the peritoneum is partially formed over every gastric organ, and

FIBROUS SYSTEM. 243 ARTICLE IX. Of Tendons. Tendons are a kind of fibrous cords, interposed between the muscles and the bones, transmitting to the latter the motions of the former, and acting in this function completely a passive part. SECTION i. Form of the Tendons. The tendons are generally situate in the ex- tremitiesof the fleshy, ^bundles, but sometimes occupy-thok; ontiro length, as is seen m the di- gastric mus(^ej^they are most generally met with in the furthest moveable extremity, 'm that which acts as a support, aad is provided with aponeuroses for insertion, as is seen particularly in the fore-arm, and in the leg, all the muscles of which arising from the upper part, over a very extensive bony or aponeurotic surface, ter- minate below in a tendon that is more or less minute; from such disposition there results, 1st. Little thickness in the extremity of the limbs, and consequently facility for their motions ; 2dly. Much resistance to exterior pressures, to which, these parts are very frequently exposed, the fibrous tissue being, as we have said, exces- sively resistant; 3dly. The concentration of the R 2

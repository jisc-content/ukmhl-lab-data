8 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. extensive motions, and the lower, by the multi- plicity, variety, and restricted limits of these motions. The conformation of all the bones is analogous ; thick and voluminous in their heads, they are thinner and generally round in their middle or body, as it is termed by anatomists. The volume of the heads of the bones affords a double advantage : 1st. To provide for articu- lation, extensive surfaces, and consequently more means of resisting dislocations; 2dly. To contri- bute to the regularity in the form of the limbs to which they belong. It may be remarked indeed, that in the limbs, the muscles and the bones are in juxta-position, but in a reverse sense ; the middle sponds with the middle thinnest, whilst the ends of these make up for the tenuity of tendons in which the others ter- minate, and which are placed near them. The increase of bulk in the heads of bones is not abrupt. It begins gradually from the body of the bone. On these heads different ridges are ob- served, intended either for articulations or points of insertion. The middle or the body has no such projections. Prominent lines only are seen intended for aponeurotic insertions, which, when strongly cha- racterized, divest the bone of its cylindrical form, a form which, however, is continued in the in- of the former, which

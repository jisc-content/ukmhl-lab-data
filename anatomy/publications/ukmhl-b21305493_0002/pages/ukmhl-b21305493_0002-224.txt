In the numerous varieties of forms we have just been examining, the general organization of the fibrous organs is nearly always the same. I shall now consider this organization, and after- wards the varieties it undergoes in each part will be treated of. It results from the assemblage of a peculiar tissue with the vascular and cellular systems, &c. SECTION i. Peculiar Tissue of the Organization of the Fibrous System. Every fibrous organ is provided for its basis with a fibre of a peculiar nature, hard, rather elastic, insensible, hardly admitting of contracti- lity, sometimes in juxta-position, and assembled together parallel to each other, as in the ten- dons, the ligaments; at other times intersected in various directions, as in the membranes, the capsules, the fibrous sheaths, &c.; but every where the same ; every where displaying a whitish or greyish hue, and a very remarkable degree of resistance.

OSSEOUS SYSTEM. Ill *incisores : first unfolded towards the gums, it sub- sequently extends from the vascular and nervous pedicle, moulds itself upon this in proceeding to that part of the alveolus, where it penetrates; so that, in this part, it forms a concave surface which encompasses the pulpous portion of the membrane, and adheres to it by different vascular extensions ; and as this portion floats, the first rudiment of the tooth floats along with it in the cavity of the membrane, as is easily ascertained by di- viding the alveolar part of this membrane, after having destroyed the corresponding side of the socket. The following are the consequences of this mode of developement: 1st, the crown is first formed, and the root is gradually produced, as ossifica- tion following the longitudinal direction, advances over that part of the membrane which lines the nervous and vascular bundle: 2dly, as all the ves- sels that resort to the tooth penetrate through the internal surface, since the external is com- pletely free within the cavity of the membrane, ossification, in diameter, is especially continued to the detriment of the internal cavity that gradually decreases, as well as the pulp, a reverse disposi- tion to that of every other bone, in which ossifi- cation begins in the centre of the cartilage, and which, primitively solid in that part, after- wards becomes hollow for the formation of the

SYNOVIAL SYSTEM* 635 transude; now from these two certain positions, should not this consequence be deduced : that ex- halation is the mode by which the synovia is con- veyed to the articulations. But to these negative proofs let us add considerations by which this proposition is fully established. The most striking resemblance between the synovia and the fluid which lubricates the par- ticles of the serous membranes are observed: 1st. Similarity of composition, for both these fluids are essentially albuminous. Albumine pre- dominates in both, though it is somewhat differ- ent, as Marguerron has demonstrated. Havers had already pointed to this analogy ; he was con- scious these two fluids were coagulable by alco- hol, acids, and caloric, though unacquainted with the principle from which this property was de- rived. 2ndly. Similitude in functions. Both are intended to lubricate surfaces performing fre- quent motions, to counteract friction, their un- avoidable effect, and prevent fatal adhesions. Both are in a similar state on their respective surfaces: they moisten their respective surfaces and are soon absorbed. 3rdly. Similarity of affections. Inflammation drains the sources of both, and more frequently produces adhesions than in the mucous membranes. Both are liable to be preternaturally increased, as in dropsies. 4thly. Similarity of absorption. The lymphatic system is the medium by which, alter having remained a

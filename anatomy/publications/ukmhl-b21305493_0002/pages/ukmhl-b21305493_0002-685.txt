SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. (>43 united to a fibrous capsule, it is still very distinct in several parts. Thus in the femur, this membrane is dissected over the inter-articular ligament, over ihe great mass of the cotyloid cavity, over the neck of the bone ; in those parts where it sepa- rates the fibrous capsule to be reflected over the cartilages, &c.; but its adhesion with these carti- lages and internal surface of the capsule, might raise some doubts respecting the form of an imperforated sac, as we have termed it. It is indispensable then, to bring forward such con- siderations as may remove these doubts. 1st. However much the synovial membranes maybe attached, they may be separated without la- ceration, by slow dissection carefully managed, and begun where the membrane is reflected from the cartilage over the capsule. Maceration long con- tinued, allows also its being removed in shreds; 2ndly. Subsequent to certain inflammatory affections, this membrane assumes a thickness and opacity, by which it is distinguished from every adjacent organ, even from those to which it is the most firmly attached; 3rdly. The synovial sacs of tendons, are in every respect quite as adherent as the articulating synovial membranes are to the cartilages of their sheath, and to the very sheath itself; but still they are allowed to be distinct ; 4thly. There are articulations provided with fibrous capsules, in which the fibres separated from each other, leave between them spaces through which synovia would escape, were they not lined t t 2 i

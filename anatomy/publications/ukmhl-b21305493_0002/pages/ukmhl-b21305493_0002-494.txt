MUSCULAR SYSTEM 452 powers decline and die away by degrees, pre- vious to the fall of the whole (which consti- tutes general death); on this event, none of the vitalities peculiar to each organ survive, whilst, after sudden death, they are more or less continued. ' Experiments cannot fairly be tried on subjects obtained from hospitals, because they cannot be procured until twelve, or fifteen hours after death ; but by killing dogs by hunger, which, if too long continued, will degenerate into a true disease, continuing eight, ten, or even twelve days, I have seen contractility completely anni- hilated at the moment of death. I have frequently had dogs brought to me affected with various dis- eases, particularly a few years ago, when a kind of epidemic affection raged amongst them. Now, on opening them at the moment of death, or on killing them before, to cause death sud- denly, quite different from that occurring in the state of health, in which the functions, and of course the vital powers of every part, were unin- jured, I could never discover the least contrac- tility, or at least it was so effectually reduced that it seemed wanting. Several physiologists have mentioned a general convulsion that seizes upon the organic muscles at the instant of death, of a heaving of the sto- mach, of the heart, of the intestines, &c. This excess of action is sometimes real in sudden

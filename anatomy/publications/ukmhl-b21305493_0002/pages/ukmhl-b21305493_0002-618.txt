MUCOUS SYSTEM. 676 markably common at that age : those of the nose, of the bronchia, even of the stomach, frequently take place : those of the parts of this system that are subjacent to the diaphragm are then much scarcer. In this respect it may be remarked that in man, the hemorrhages of the gastro-pulmonary surfaces are much more frequent than those of the genito-urinary surface, which, on the contrary, is much more extensive in the female, in whom a natural one exists in this part, namely, the men- strual discharge.

Its vital energy still seems to pre-

715 Â£ LA NHL'LA 11 SYST11M. periments relative to the state of the gastric viscera during digestion and hunger, I have no- ticed , that as long as the food has not left the stomach, the supply of bile is rather scanty, but that it flows in abundance the moment it enters the duodenum ; so that a quantity of this fluid is then found in the intestines. During hunger the gall-bladder is much distended; a small quantity of bile only flows from it. Towards the latter stage of digestion, and even when this is partly effected, it contains half the previous quantity. It ought, however, to empty much sooner during abstinence, when the fluid it then contains is of a dark green, very bitter, very acrimonious, and consequently very irritating. In the course of digestion, or immediately after this function is effected, it is not so deeply coloured, is of a light yellow colour, and is less irritating. Another stimulant then is required during digestion ; now, that stimulant is the food crossing the extremity of the ductus choledocus. In my treatise on the membranes I have given a circumstantial account of the course of the cystic and hepatic bile. Let us conclude from these numerous conside- rations, that one of the principal agents nature selects to increase the action of the glands, and to promote that of their excretory ducts, is the sympathetic irritation at the extremities of these tubes which open upon the mucous membrane.

Organization, Properties, <$fC, To study the organization of the nail with some degree of accuracy, the largest must be selected, such as those of the great toe or thumb, &c. the convex surface is then evidently seen composed of a single sheet. In the posterior part there is nothing more than this sheet; hence its re- markable tenuity in that part, but as we pro- ceed towards the anterior part, new sheets are seen added in succession in the concave surface,- so that the nail progressively thickens. These laminae are easily removed sheet by sheet, the furthermost are the shortest.

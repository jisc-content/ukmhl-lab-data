365 OF ANIMAL LIFE. it, they vary according to the vitality of the mus- cle and the nature of the stimulant. At the com- mencement of experiments, they succeed each other with astonishing rapidity, and sometimes this rapidity is such, that the eye cannot discern all their motions. As the organ becomes languid, its contractions become slower, and after some time they completely cease ; but they may be re- newed by using a very active stimulant, which also ultimately ceases to produce any effect. 2dly. If a voluntary muscle be caused to con- tract by irritating the nerve, more rapid contrac- tions will result than by irritating the muscle it- self. The rapidity in the act of running would be incalculable, if each contraction were equal to that produced by these means, particularly of animals endowed with considerable vitality on the one part, and very powerful stimulants, such as galvanism for instance, on the other, be selected for the experiment. I have remarked in this re- spect, that the rapidity and the powers of con- tractions are not in general more increased by irritating at the same time all the nerves that re- sort to a muscle, than by irritating a single one only. 3dly. Whenever the rapidity of muscular con- traction is governed by the will, that rapidity admits of innumerable varieties; but there is al- ways a degree that can never be exceeded. This

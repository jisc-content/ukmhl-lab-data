95 OSSEOUS SYSTEM, chapter that treats of this membrane, we shall see how far such an opinion must be trusted to. It is chiefly at this epoch, in which the process of nutrition seems applied to the surface of the bones, that the different elevations on their sur- face become still more prominent, particularly the apophyses for insertions. In respect to these, there is a remarkable difference between the skeleton of a child, and that of a man ; in the foetus, these projections are scarcely existing, as mav be seen in the different apophyses of the vertebrae, particularly in the spinous apophyses. As such projections, in general, are at the greatest distance from the primitive centre of os- sification, it appears that the slowness of their progress must be attributed to this circumstance, since ossification constantly proceeds on from the point wherein it commenced to those more distant. When the bone has acquired all its dimensions, it still continues to be the focus of very active nutrition ; exhalation incessantly supplies it with gelatine and calcareous matter that are subse- quently taken up by absorption, so that this or- gan is uninterruptedly composed and decom- posed ; the experiment tried with madder, indis- putably establishes the fact; if an animal, par- ticalarly a young one, has for some time been fed upon this plan, all its bones become red, so that, on amputating a limb, they present an

309 OF ANIMAL LIFF. muscles are excited, the others cannot counterba- lance the action. A paralysis of the sterno-mas- toideus displays, in respect to the whole head, a phenomenon similar to that produced by the pre- ceding instance with regard to the mouth, Stra- bism frequently proceeds from this cause. In general, in all these phenomena, it is neces- sary to consider what belongs to the vital powers, and what proceeds from the contractility of the tissue. The muscles are antagonists in respect to these powers, as in respect to their j contractility ; but as the contraction which depends upon the nervous influence, or from irritability, is much better characterized than that of the organic tis- sue, the phenomena in the antagonist muscles are much more striking in paralysis when the sound muscles are brought to act in the former manner. It appears that in numerous cases of paralysis, the contractility of tissue on the diseased side is also rather effected, but is never so completely destroyed as to leave, in the amputation of a pa- ralysed limb, no power of muscular re-action. I have tried this experiment upon a dog ten days after, the nerves having been cut, during which interval the limb had remained completely mo- tionless. The section of the muscles produced an evident vacancy between the two divided ends ; and I also found no difference when, subsequently, and for the sake of comparison, I amputated the other limb.

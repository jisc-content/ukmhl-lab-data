591 SEKOUS SYSTEM. formation, lthly. Between the two parts of the pleura, a number of other extensions very dis- tinct are frequently observed; they are not smooth, form no tubes, but appear like flakes, and per- fectly similar to the cellular points; so that wherever they are met with, one might think the membrane has been completely converted into this tissue, which besides, as we shall find, is the essential basis of its organization. 5thly. I am not speaking of the adhesions effected by the false membranes, by the albuminous flakes situate between two parts of a serous surface, &c. Such adhesions are in some degree unconnected with these surfaces. SECTION II. Adherent Surface of the Serous System. The external surface of the serous membranes adheres nearly everywhere to the adjacent organs: these membranes are rarely found isolated on both sides. The tunica arachnoides in the basis of the cranium, and a few others are excep- tions. This adhesion of the serous membranes is perfectly distinct from that of the fibrous mem- branes. In this the crossing of the vessels, so completely unites the two parts together, that they seem to share the same organization, so that when one is removed the other generally dies, as is seen in respect to the periosteum, and the

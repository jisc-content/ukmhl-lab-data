That this production is quite distinct from those of the internal organs. 2ndly. That it can only form upon the skin, and that the slight pellicle which all other cicatrized parts are covered with, subsequent to a wound attended with loss of substance, cannot be compared with it, and even present quite a different texture. Thus, this pellicle is not removed by the same means as the epidermis, and it certainly becomes the seat of a quick sensibility, which the epider- mis will never possess. This is particularly ex- emplified in change of weather, when cicatrices become as is well known exceedingly painful. I have often remarked then, that not only the in- terior of the cicatrice, but the pellicle itself is remarkably affected : besides on this pellicle forming it is evidently overrun with blood vessels, whilst nothing similar to this is ever observed in the regeneration of the epidermis. It is this faculty of reproducing itself that comes into play in a number of excrescences in the epidermis, as in corns and callosities, which have nothing more in common with those that line fistulee, &c. but the name. All these excrescences are denied sensibility, vessels and nerves, and present the same degree of con- sistence and the same hue as the epidermis; they 3 m 2

154 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. probably be required to reduce them to that soft, mucous, and liquid pulp, to which the greatest part of organs are brought by maceration. The cartilaginous tissue, like every other, con- tracts when exposed to great heat; this pheno- menon, however, is not observed in the thyroid cartilage on account of its thickness, and in the cartilages that cover the bones, on account of their adherence with these organs; but if the former be divided into thin lamellae, and the latter be removed in slices, and immersed in boiling water, they instantly contract strongly. On becoming dry, the cartilaginous tissue assumes a yellowish hue, a semi-transparency similar to that of tendons and ligaments that have undergone the same preparation; it contracts, is reduced in volume, and deprived of its elasticity in propor- tion as it hardens. By ebullition, this substance also acquires a yel- lowish hue, then over the articulary heads it cracks and splits in several places, it drops off in sheets that are softened, and is finally reduced nearly to a complete state of fusion,- excepting only a small residue, which does not appear to be of a gelatinous nature. The softening of the cartilaginous substance by boiling water, renders it more fit than it is in the natural state to be dissolved by the gastric juices. Swallowed raw, cartilages remain a long time in the stomach, whilst they are very quickly digested, being

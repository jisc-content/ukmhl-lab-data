EPIDERM01DAL SYSTEM. 901 themselves had they studied that of the foetus, already strongly characterized, even more so than several other systems. It is observed that from the moment the skin begins to lose that kind of pulpy state we have already asserted to exist towards the end of the fifth month, it acquires proportions analogous to such as will be subsequently produced. Very thick in the sole of the foot and palm of the hand, it is very thin in any other part, and is easily removed by using the means I have described. In the foetus that has become putrid in the womb it is partly loosened as is well known. On a level with the umbilical cord it is continued in an insensible manner with the skin. At birth, although coming in contact with a fluid new to it, it undergoes no great alteration, which evidently proves, that the air has but very little to do with its formation ; as age advances it becomes thicker, and follows in this respect nearly the same properties as the skin. On reaching the age of twenty-six or thirty, it ceases to increase. I have raised the epidermis in different parts of an aged subject, but found no great difference with that of an adult, only it was rather more liable to exfoliation, and somewhat thicker. In those unfortunate wretches that sometimes seek a shelter in hospitals vermin are frequently seen to thrive in the crevices it con- tains, and subsequently to invade the spaces be-

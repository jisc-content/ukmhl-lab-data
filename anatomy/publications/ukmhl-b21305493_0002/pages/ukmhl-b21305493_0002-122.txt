80 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. moveable articulations. It is on this account they are possessed of the two species of organs espe- cially intended to secure the articulating surfaces of each of these classes, namely, the cartilages and the ligaments. The immoveable articulations with implanted surfaces, an order exclusively composed by the teeth, have no other uniting agent between their surfaces, than a mucous membrane, the palatine. This explains why, by the congestions, of this membrane, by scorbutic affections, and by the use of mercury, &c. the teeth are loosened, &c. TJnion of the Moveable Articulations. The moveable articulations, with contiguous surfaces, are especially united by the ligaments met with in the five genera, but under different forms, that will subsequently be examined. In this species of articulation a considerable degree of suppleness is added to a very powerful resistance, a twofold attribute it borrows from its peculiar tex- ture, and which renders it very proper for this func- tion. Let us remark, however, that these two pro- perties are in a reverse sense in the two most dis- tant stages of life ; that suppleness is the property of infancy, and that stiffness and resistance cha- racterize the ligaments in the aged subject; hence partly proceeds the multiplicity of motions in the

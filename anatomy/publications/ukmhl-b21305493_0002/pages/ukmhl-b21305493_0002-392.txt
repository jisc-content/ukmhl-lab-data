350 MUSCULAR SYSTEM share in common. Now animal contractility in the living body, may be destroyed by dividing every nerve of a muscle or of a limb, which is then completely paralyzed. The brain can no longer act upon them, and every result obtained by stimulants, essentially belongs to the sensible organic contractility. The permanence of this last property, after the experiment I have pointed out, evidently proves that the nerves have no- thing to do with it, that it essentially resides in the muscular tissue,â€”is inherent, as Haller has ex- pressed it. Thus, whilst in the different species of paralysis the muscles are deprived of the faculty of obeying the cerebral influence, or ra- ther this influence being annulled, they retain the power of contracting in a visible manner. This contraction, from a co-operation of sti- mulants upon the muscles of animal life, is dis- played in two very distinct modes. 1st. The whole of the muscle may be contracted, and shrink in such a manner as to cause the two points of origin and insertion to approximate; a circumstance that generally occurs after death, when the muscles are still replete with life. 2ndly. There are frequently multiplied and simultaneous % oscillations of the fibres; but this is not a con- traction, but only a vibration, a quivering, which has no evident effect upon the whole of the mus- cle which does not contract; an action which takes place when life has almost forsaken the muscle.

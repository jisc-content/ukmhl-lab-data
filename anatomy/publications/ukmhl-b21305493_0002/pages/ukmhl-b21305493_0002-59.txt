OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 17 fering from these in structure, is never implanted in bony eminences and in bones in general, but by means of the above-mentioned organs ; muscles are a striking instance of this. These eminences are in general less character- ized in the female than in the male ; in the infant than in the adult; in weak animals than in such as are carniverous, that live by seizing upon, and destroying their prey. The degree of projection of these eminences for insertion, is always a sure sign of strength, and of energy in the motions. These powers are so much the more developed, as the muscles are the better characterized. Let us only compare the skeleton of a powerful man of a sanguine habit, in whom the muscular system is conspicuous through the integuments, with that of a week phlegmatic subject, whose effeminate forms, like those of a woman, are not outwardly expressed, and we shall perceive the difference. Ihe form of these eminences for insertion vary considerably ; sometimes muscles only are inserted by a number of isolated aponeurotic fibres ; in this case they are small, very numerous, forming as- perities that cover a greater or less surface ; at other times it is from a single tendon the muscle borrows its origin, in which case the apophysis is generally very prominent, and requires but little space. Sometimes a wide aponeurosis gives birth to fleshy fibres ; when it forms a bony line, more or less prominent, that receives the insertion. VOL. If. r

366 MUSCULAR SYSTEM degree is not the same in every subject, even in this respect they differ essentially from each other ; but this has nothing to do with the powers of organization in the muscles ; it rarely happens that the same individuals who display great mus- cular powers, are the best runners. I am not aware that any connexion between the external appear- ance of the body, and the rapidity of contractions has been observed, as there is one to indicate their power ; but still it must exist. The degree of ra- pidity of which men and animals are susceptible, varies ad infinitum. I shall not produce instances of rapid speed, of analogous motions performed by the superior limbs, as by the fingers, in play- ing on various instruments, the violin, the flute, &c.; of these numerous authors have quoted sur- prizing examples: I shall merely observe, there are few motions that will convey so correct an idea of this rapidity, as the abrupt and quick con- tractions of the inferior extremities produced by the act of leaping, or their forcible projection in that of kicking; those which in the superior extremities serve to project heavy bodies; those which in the same organs thrust the trunk backwards; when pressing against a resisting surface, we extend them suddenly, and throw back the motion upon the trunk ; those again which occur in giving a blow with the fist; those which produce that abrupt motion of the

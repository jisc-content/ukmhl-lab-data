220 FIBROUS SYSTEM. but it has: appeared to me impracticable ; if it were not so, the animal would soon die from the extent of injury ; thus, no result could be obtained. The connexions between the periosteum and the adjacent organs, vary in an astonishing de- gree. In the greater number of bones the mus- cles glide upon it, and it is more or less ultimately united to them by cellular membrane, according to the necessity for motion. Subsequent to in- flammations, it loses this laxity, and frequently all motion is at an end. - - - L ' i" • . •; •, o . j i\ r; f f Organization of the Periosteum. | f . # ; *'i.

These fibres placed over each other, differ in length : the superficial are the most ex- tensive ; those that immediately correspond to the bone, overrun a short distance only. In ge- neral, they are all rendered very apparent by cer- tain diseases of these organs. Amongst numer- ous instances of this accidental develojjement of fibres, I recollect the ca$e of a man affected with elephantiasis, and at the same time labouring un- der a swelling in the compact tissue of the tibia.

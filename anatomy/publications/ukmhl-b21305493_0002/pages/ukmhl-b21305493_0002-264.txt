222 FIBROUS SI STEM. would not have met with a sufficient degree of resistance, whilst thus attached to the bone it moves that organ without endangering its cover- ing. The general organization, the properties, the vitality of the periosteum, being the same as those of the fibrous system, I shall pass over them unnoticed. Development of the Periosteum. In the foetus, this membrane is soft, spongy, permeated with a considerable quantity of gelati- nous fluid, and is easily diffused in water; its fibres are not very distinct, but they become more so as age advances; at the same time softness dimi- nishes, and resistance is increased. The periosteum in the aged subject is very tough; it will resist ebul- lition nearly as long as ligaments. Those who prepare skeletons are aware of this. It splits into several places, because its fibres, by contracting, separate from the bone; but the remaining part is with difficulty reduced to a cartilaginous state. Functions of the Periosteum. The periosteum protects the bone it covers from the impression of the surrounding moveable parts, from that of the muscles, from the arteries, the pulsation of which might wear them, as is the case with some aneurismal tumours near the sternum, the vertebras, &c.

65 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. more or less, as they are nearer or more distant from these, in the order above stated. Considerations respecting the Moveable Articulations. This class of articulations is the more import- ant to consider, because their mechanism is the most complicated of the two orders that com- pose it. The last, or that of articulations with continued surfaces, we shall in these general con- siderations pass unnoticed, since it contains one single species of motion only,—that of the verte- brae,—which motion will be considered in exam- ining the spine. The order of the moveable articulations with contiguous surfaces, includes, as we have said, five genera, characterized by their respective motions. First Genus. General opposition, circumduction, and rota- tion, characterize this genus; the first, by the extent and multiplicity of the motions: that of the humerus and scapula, the femur and bones of the pelvis are instances of it; they even exclu- sively compose this genus. We may conceive why nature has fixed this VOL. If. - p

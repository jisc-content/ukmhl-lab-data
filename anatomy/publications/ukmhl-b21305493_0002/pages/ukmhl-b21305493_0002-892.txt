There must certainly be cases in which one of these two means must be preferable to the other. I intend to make further inquiries on this subject. The various stimulants employed in diseases have not yet been sufficiently analysed; and the utmost advantage has certainly not been derived from what observation has already taught re- specting the sympathies we can produce volun- tarily.

One dimension only predominates in the first, namely, length. Two are observed nearly in an equal proportion, in the second, length and breadth. These two last dimensions, in addition to thickness, characterize the short bones. Let us consider each in a general manner. SECTION i. 'S » . Of the Long Bones. The long bones in general belong to the parts for locomotion, where they form a kind of levers moved by the muscles in various directions. They are all situate within the limbs, where, by their assemblage, they constitute a kind of central and moveable column. On examining them from the superior part to the inferior, from the femur or the humerus down to the phalanges of the toes, or of the fingers, they are seen successively to di- minish in length and increase in number. From , this twofold reverse disposition, it follows, that the superior regions of the limbs are characterized by

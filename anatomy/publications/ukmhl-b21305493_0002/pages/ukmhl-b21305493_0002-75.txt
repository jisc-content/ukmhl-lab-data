OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 33 SwtH-C* ;<' v compact tissue forms the external part and lines the bone, whilst the cancelli occupy the interior. The nasal process only is an exception to this rule, whose modifications we shall now consider. 1st. In the long' bones the compact tissue is particularly remarkable for its thickness in the centre, where it is intended for a threefold use; first, to protect effectually the medullary organ it jhae3, then to insure the solidity of the bone in this part, to which much more than to the ends every powerful effort of locomotion, of falls, of counter strokes, &c. is directed, and wherein the bone crossed by a few very weak cellular fibres only, can borrow no power of resistance from its external parieties. Finally, to reduce the volume of the middle part of the bone without endanger- ing the limb, whose form is thereby, as we have seen, rendered much more regular. In pro- portion as we recede from the centre of a long bone sawed in a longitudinal direction, the outward shell is observed to decrease in thick- ness, and to be gradually reduced in the end to a thin plate similar to that of the short bones; thus the resisting power in long bones consists less in their compact structure,, than in the profuse quan- QU / ^ tity of cancelli crowded within ; it is this parti- ^ cularly that prevents fractures, from whence it is seen how the proportion between the compact and spongy tissues being in a reverse sense in the L' u VOL. if.

fi40 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM* The synovial membrane is found in all the moveable articulations, the greater part of which possess nothing' more than this membrane and lateral ligaments. ^What are generally termed fibrous capsules, are^seen around some articu- lating surfaces. The connexions of the humerus, femur, and of two or three other bones, are the only instances. In these articulations, two very distinct envelopements are obvious : the one, ex- ternal and fibrous, is disposed in the form of a bag, open above and below, embracing by both its large openings the surfaces of the two bones, and identifying itself in those parts with the perios- teum, by intermixing its fibres with those of that organ. The other cellular, which is the synovial membrane, lines the former within, and forsakes it on approaching the two inter-articular cartilages, and is reflected over them instead of uniting with the periosteum. Boyer has described this dispo- sition in respect to the femur. In all the hinge, like articulations, as in those of the elbow, knee, the phalanges of the hands and feet, &c. &c., the fibrous capsules are wholly deficient. The fibres, instead of spreading and in- terweaving into a membrane,contract into fasciculi of greater or less thickness, forming the lateral ligaments. Nothing more can be found than the internal sheet of the enarthrodial articulations, that is to say, the synovial membrane, which also does not here contract the slightest adhesion with

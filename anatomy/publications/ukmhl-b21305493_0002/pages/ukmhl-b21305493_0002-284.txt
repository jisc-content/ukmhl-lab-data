FIBROUS SYSTEM. 242 •*. ■ - fibres must widen the passage, instead of contract- ing it, since the necessary effect of these contrac- tions is to enlarge in every direction the aponeu- rotic curve ; an effect which would be quite the reverse if the insertion took place in the concave side. These kinds of aponeurosis are strongly in- terwoven, and are very resistant. Aponeuroses for Insertion by isolated Fibres. These are an assemblage of numerous small fibrous bodies, all very distinct from each other, that seem to arise from the periosteum in the same manner as the threads of a piece of velvet project from their common texture : each of them is continued with a fleshy fibre, so that when all these fibres have been removed by maceration, these small bodies are left floating, and per- fectly visible, particularly when some periosteum that has been detached is selected for the expe- riment. It will be conceived that this mode of muscu- lar insertion must always require very extensive bony surfaces, since each fibre has its individual allotted place ; as for instance, in the upper por- tion of the iliac, of the anterior tibial, of the temporal, &c. If every muscle followed this mode, a surface tenfold more extensive in the skeleton would not be sufficient for their in- sertions.

MUSCULAR SYSTEM 442 of such fluids with the sensible organic contracti- lity will take place, whether, as in the preceding case, these fluids are applied over the mucous sur- faces that correspond to the muscles, or they be conveyed to these muscles by circulation, as has been proved by the experiments performed in the last century, on introducing medicated substances into the veins ; of which experiments Haller has collected a multiplicity of results. In these ex- periments circulation has been seen conveying to all the organs, at one time, emetics, and the sto- mach alone contracted ; at another time purga- tives, and the intestines only were brought into action, &c. Taken in by cutaneous absorption, the medicated substances give rise to a similar phenomenon. Purgatives and emetics, &c. ap- plied by friction, cause the contraction, not of all the organic muscles, although circulation con- veys these substances to all, but of those with which their sensibility is connected. During the various diseases that are seated in these organs, each organic muscle is seen to pos- sess a peculiar mode of irritation, to answer to one stimulant, and remain insensible, as it were, in the rest. Second Variety.—Age. Age modifies sensible organic contractility in a remarkable degree. Very striking in infancy>

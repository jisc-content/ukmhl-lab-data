DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 862 the integuments of the cheek are swollen, pre- vent the wrinkles from forming ; but as the hands and feet, from the natural position of the foetus, are bent at their articulations, divers wrinkles are formed in those parts ; in the hand especially, where, however, they are less obvious than at a later period. The curved lines formed by the papillae are more conspicuous in the hand and foot, even when the epidermis is removed. The internal surface of the skin in the foetus is very remarkable for the looseness of its con- nection with the subjacent cellular tissue, the cellulee of which, filled with granulated fat, are easily removed by scraping this surface with the scalpel. The areolae at this epoch are already formed, and proportionally as distinct as at a later period ; on dissecting them from the internal to the external part, they are seen gradually to fade away on reaching the surface, where the skin is condensed. The skin in the foetus is proportionally per- meated with more blood than at any other stage of life. How very correct this assertion is, will easily be ascertained by extracting alive the foetus from the womb of an animal; for after birth (in whatever species,) or in such as have come before the time prescribed by nature, the very cause through which the vital spark has fled, by either increasing or diminishing, in this last moment, the quantity of blood circulated in

343 OF ANIMAL LIFE. two organs still for a considerable time answer to the different stimuli. In whatever manner the brain, the marrow, or the nerves of an animal recently killed be excited, the muscles are in- stantly convulsed ; it is the same phenomenon as that which occurs during life from a similar cause. This phenomenon is frequently more apparent im- mediately after death than previous to it, as I have repeatedly ascertained in my experiments. If, during life, any nerve be irritated, there will be scarcely any contraction, because the will acting at the same time upon the same muscles through other nerves, or at least upon those of the limb, contractions are opposed to those the irritation tended are produced. I have repeatedly noticed that the galvanic phenomena are also much more easily produced, even in animals provided with red and warm blood, an instant after death, than during life ; in the latter case there will be hardly any re- sult, because their influence is opposed by that of the brain. Whenever irritation is directly ap- plied to the brain, or to the superior part of the spine, it then overpowers the will; it is much stronger in the living animal; but in an isolated nerve, the contrary is the case ; not that the will acts by the irritated nerve, for in respect to this, influence is limited to the irritated spot; but it is affected by the adjacent nerves. To the susceptibility of the brain, and of the nerves, of transmitting after death, the principle

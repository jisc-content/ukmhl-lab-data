358 MUSCULAR SYSTEM SECTION II. Powers of the Muscular Contraction. The power of contraction in the muscles of life varies excessively, accordingly as it has been brought to act by mechanical agents, or by cere- bral influence. Every irritating substance applied to a muscle laid bare, will produce an abrupt, rapid, but not an energetic motion; by my experiments, I have frequently convinced myself it was impossible by these means to approach even remotely the ex- cessive degree of energy communicated by the brain to the muscles of animal life. The muscular system of organic life, principally put in motion by stimulants immediately applied, never displays exacerbations corresponding to those which, in peculiar circumstances, is displayed so conspicu- ously by animal contractility. The power of contraction then should be examined, when the muscles are moved, in virtue of this last property. Now this contraction may, as we have seen, be determined by; 1st. Exciting the brain in expe- riments ; 2dly. When this excitement takes place in the natural state, by the power, by the will, or by sympathy. In the first case, the power of contraction is never very energetic, whatever may be the exciting agent, either applied to the brain or to the denuded nerves. I have constantly ob-

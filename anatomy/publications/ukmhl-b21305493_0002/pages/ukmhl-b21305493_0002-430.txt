388 MUSCULAR SYSTEM birth; but in general, the motions are not so striking as when the florid colour of the skin shows that the arterial blood is subjected to the influence of respiration. The circulation of the red blood in muscles does not immediately impart to them that colour of which they are subsequently possessed ; for some time after birth they still display a dark tint, evidently proved by dissections, because, as I have said before, their colour does not proceed from the colouring matter circulating in their tissue, but actually from that combined with the tissue itself. Now nutrition alone produces the combination ; but this function operates by de- grees only; it is actually a chronic function, when compared with exhalation, absorption, and circulation, which evidently assume an acute type. Asjige advances, the muscles gradually assume a deeper colour, they are permeated with more blood, and are more abundantly nourished than many other organs. This is particularly remarka- ble in those of the inferior extremities. I have remarked, however, that as long as growth is continued, it acts upon the length and not on the thickness of the muscles. This explains why they are not so conspicuous through the inte- guments, why the forms are fuller and more graceful, but less manly, at that stage of life. The

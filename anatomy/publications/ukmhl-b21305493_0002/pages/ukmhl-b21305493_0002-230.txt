FIBROUS SYSTEM* 188 state, and which it subsequently loses by soften- ing to be converted into a gelatinous state. By putting all the parts of this system at the same time in water, that is gradually heated to ebulli- tion, this softening is observed to be produced in the same degree in each, and nearly to the same extent. That force, which in this instance tends to contract the fibres of this system, is very consi- derable, it suffices to tear off those of the periosteum from their insertions, and which, by this mechanism are removed from the bones that have been boil- ing for some length of time ; also to separate the inter-osseous ligaments, the obturator membrane, &c., when they are plunged in boiling water along with the bones to which they adhere ; it is also sufficient to lock the articulating surfaces so effectually against each other, that they can no longer be removed, when, together with their ligaments, they have been exposed to considerable heat. The fibrous tissue softens by degrees in boiling water, becomes rather yellow, semi-transparent, and finally is, in part, diffused. In boiling to- gether all the parts of the fibrous tissue, I have observed that the tendons are first softened ; next the aponeuroses, then the membranes, capsules, and fibrous sheaths, and finally the ligaments, that are as in respect to maceration, those that yield the last. Many others have already made this remark, to which I add, that all the ligaments

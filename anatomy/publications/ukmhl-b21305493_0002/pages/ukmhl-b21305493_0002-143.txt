OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 101 bone must remain disunited: lienee unnatural ar- ticulations. The callus forms with difficulty, whenever the ends, divided and laid bare, join with the ad- jacent parts in the suppuration, as is the case in complicated fractures, because the formation of pus expends the nutritive substance intended to repair the injury. Further considerations on this singular production belong to pathology. In this chapter I have neglected to bring for- ward the notions of the ancients, who supposed that bones were formed by the hardening of a bony juice, the existence of which has never been demonstrated. Haller's ideas were, that the im- pulse of the heart formed arterial ducts in the bony substance, and hardened that substance by the pulsation of the arteries. DuhamePs notions were, that every thing depended upon the perios- teum. I shall refer to the books that have re- peatedly exposed these opinions. Without entering upon any individual refu- tation of any of these doctrines, I shall observe they are all stamped with a fundamental defect; that of considering the nutrition in bones in an isolated manner, and not representing it as a division of nutrition at large ; of admitting, for its explanation, arguments singly applicable to these organs, and that are not consequent to those which serve to ascertain the nutrition of every other organ. Let us never lose sight of that

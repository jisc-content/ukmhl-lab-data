DE K iVJOI DAL SYSTEM. 763 moment it is stripped of the epidermis; but this coat is evidently the produce of decomposition. Nothing similar to this is to be found in the natu- ral state. From all these considerations, it appears that there is no substance deposited by the vessels upon the surface of the corium, extravasated, and stag- nating upon this surface, and forming there a coat in the sense in which Malpighi had conceived it. I believe, that by rete mucosurn should be under- stood, a net of vessels excessively thin, the trunk of which, thin also, after having passed through the numerous pores with which the corium is perforated, to ramify upon its surface, and contain different kinds of fluids. The existence of this vascular net is obviously proved by liquid injections, which completely change the hue of the skin outwards, without in- fluencing it much interiorly. It is this which, as I have observed, is essentially the seat of the numerous eruptions, the greater part of which are actually unconnected with the cutaneous corium. The rete mucosurn then, may be conceived as a general capillary system, enveloping the cu- taneous organ, and forming, in common with the papillae, a layer interposed between the corium and the epidermis. In most subjects this system contains nothing more than white fluids. In ne- groes these fluids are black ; they are of an inter- mediate hue in dark coloured people ; and how

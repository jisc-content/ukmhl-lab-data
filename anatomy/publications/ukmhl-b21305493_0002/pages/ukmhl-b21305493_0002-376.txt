MUSCULAR SYSTEM 334 Will the contact of the different gases with the muscles modify their contractions? Since my publication on membranes I have tried no expe- riments on this head. Those contained in that work give the following results:â€”The frogs and gui- nea-pigs made emphysematous by forcing into the sub-cutaneous tissue air, which subsequently in- vades the cellular interstices, and comes every where in contact with the muscular system, move nearly as usual. If oxygen be selected for the experiment, the motions of the inflated animal are not accelerated, they are not lessened if inflated with carbonic gas, with hydrogen, &c. Every inflation I have attempted on each individual of the two species already mentioned, of animals provided with red and cold blood, and of those with red and warm, to obtain an exam- ple of each, have in general perfectly succeeded; the animals apparently experienced no essential inconvenience from it, and it gradually disap- peared. Emphysema produced by nitrous gas is always fatal, the contact of the fluid seems to pa- ralyze the muscles almost immediately. 7thly. If instead of inflating the cellular tissue of a living animal with gas, other fluid substances are propelled in that tissue, they will produce different effects according to their nature, their sour, mild, and styptic qualities, &c. No injec- tion whatever will produce a quicker or a more striking effect than a mixture of opium, or its

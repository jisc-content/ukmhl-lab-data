I DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 811 upon some diseases, in which blood is actually respired. 3dly. By natural sweat and transpira- tion, which certainly could not possibly be effect- ed without this agency, although several authors i have admitted of pretended glands to separate these fluids. Calculations, ad infinitum, have been resorted to, in order to ascertain the quantity of fluids habitually shed by the cutaneous exhalents. We are terrified on reading the results obtained with much labour, by a number of philosophers on this head; on perusing the prodigiously extended calculations of Dodard, Sanctorius, Keil, Ro- binson, Rye, &c. To what have these enor- mous calculations conduced, for which the whole course of a single individualâ€™s life would probably have proved too short, unless it were to convince us, that, whenever we start from an erroneous principle, the whole link of consequences deduced from it, notwithstanding that these consequences be rigorously deduced the one from the other, is false: the greater part, in fact, of these authors have consider- ed the skin as a kind of fountain, provided with multiplied capillary tubes, which in the same lapse of time pour out incessantly the same quantity of fluids, and admit, consequently, of being submitted as well as the inert capillary tubes that pour out fluids to approximations and calculations in respect to quantity. But the result of these calcu-

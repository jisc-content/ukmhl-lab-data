196 FIBROUS SYSTEM. only by the motions of the limb, contact is ob- tained by placing the patient in such a position, as that in which the tendon will not be drawn in the natural state ; whilst, for a divided muscle, not only this position is required, but also that which produces the most relaxation ; and even then, very often, the divided parts cannot be brought in contact. If, while a muscle is distended, the tendon of this muscle be divided in a living animal, the end continued with the fleshy fibres will withdraw a little from the other, by the retraction of these fibres ; but the one that holds to the bone remains unmoved; so that in this case, one cause only of retraction exists, whereas in the division of a fleshy part, there are two. Jf a tendon be divided when the muscle is relaxed, the ends remain close to each other. The contractility of tissue, however, after some time has elapsed, discloses itself in the fibrous sys- tem, particularly when the organ has been ori- ginally distended; for in its natural state, it is nearly wanting.

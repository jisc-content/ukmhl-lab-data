67 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. mean, that a concavity is seen to move in every direction, on a convex surface ; but in man this disposition does not exist. Although in respect to motion, the two limbs have the utmost analogy with each other, there are some few distinctions relating parti- cularly to their respective uses; which are, in the one, to grasp at or repulse external bodies, in the other, to perform locomotion. The most essential of these distinctions is, that rotation and circumduction take place in a reverse sense, in these articulations. The mechanical cause, and the advantages of this disposition, are easily felt. In the femur, the length of the neck that acts as the lever for rotation, admits of very exten- sive motions, which make up for the want of pronation and supination in the leg, so that in every rotation of the foot there is a motion of the whole limb. In the humerus, on the contrary, the neck being very short, tends to concentrate the motion to the axis of the bone, and limits rota- tion, which can more readily be dispensed with, on account of that of the fore-arm ; the motion of the hand inward and outward, then, is never performed but by a part of the limb. In respect to circumduction, or circular motion, the length of the neck of the femur is an obstacle to it. In fact, we must observe that this motion • » is in general more easily performed, as it is exe- cuted by a rectilinear lever, because then the f 2

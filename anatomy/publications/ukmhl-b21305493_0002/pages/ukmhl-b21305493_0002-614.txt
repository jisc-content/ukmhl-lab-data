The developement of the mucous system fol- lows, in general, the laws of the organs to which it belongs. Early in the gastric organs, more retarded in the pulmonary, and in that of gene- ration, it seems in its growth rather to obey a received impulse than to impress one upon its surrounding parts ; a disposition common nearly to all systems that contribute to form particular parts. Let it be observed in fact, there constantly exists in growth certain parts to which all the others are referred : thus the size of the brain determines that of the bones of the skull, of the dura-mater, the pia-mater, the tunica arachnoides, and of their vessels.

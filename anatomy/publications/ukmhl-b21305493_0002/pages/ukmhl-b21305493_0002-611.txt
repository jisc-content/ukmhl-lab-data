MUCOUS SYSTEM. 569 brane differs from that of the palate; how much the membrane of the glands and of the urethra is quickly stimulated by the emission of semen, which would make no impression on any other mucous surface. The same observation applies to the organic sensibility and contractility of the same description. Every mucous surface con- nected with its habitual fluid could hardly bear the approach of any other. Urine would be irri- tating to the stomach ; the gastric juices to the bladder; the bile stagnant in the gall bladder would produce a catarrh if applied to the mem- brane of the nostrils, in the seminal organs, &c. From such varieties in the vital powers of each division of the mucous system, should it then be matter of wonder if the diseases of this system are so very variable ? Each actually bears a general character, but this character is modified accord- ing to every mucous surface. There is an order of symptoms common to all catarrhs ; but every individual catarrh has its particular signs, each a different product. The humour expelled in a pulmonary catarrh in no respect resembles that of the nose ; the discharges proceeding from a catarrh in the uterus, in the bladder, &c. are quite distinct from those of intestinal catarrhs, &c. These fluids display in their morbid changes the very same differences we have pointed out in their natural composition, differences proceeding,

427 OF ORGANIC LIFE. I) verse efforts, the one superior, effected by the gastric viscera being pressed by diaphragm and the abdominal muscles ; the other inferior, which is chiefly from the levatores ani contracting in an ascending direction, w hilst the opposite effort acts in the reverse one. Now both these efforts are evi- dently under the cerebral influence. I have fre- quently had opportunities of examining the blad- der, filled with urine, in a living animal, when the abdomen was laid open; but I never saw it contract sufficiently to expel this fluid. I do not contend, but that the bladder, owing to the nerves which it receives from the sacral plexuses, may be in some degree a voluntary muscle, but I say it is chiefly by collateral powers superadded to its own, and chiefly to its functions, that this organ is submitted to the will; that animal contractility has a greater share in its function than sensible organic contractility; how then does it happen that the urine is kept within this organ, or expelled from its cavity at will ? It is as follows: When the urine that drops into the bladder, has not stagnated therein long, and is in small quantity only, it is not then sufficiently stimulating to call the sensible organic contractility into action, the effort of the bladder is so weak that it cannot overcome the resistance offered by the urethra, which being contracted by the pow- ers of the tissue, must be dilated again by the

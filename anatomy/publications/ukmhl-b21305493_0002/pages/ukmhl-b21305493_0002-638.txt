596 SEROUS SYSTEM. sensible and very dry, the motions of the organs they invest are remarkably painful. It is during these first periods the adhesions take place: if they do not form either on account of motion, or from any other reason, and if the inflammation does not subside by resolution, then what happens in an open wound takes place in the serous surfaces; they suppurate. Now this suppuration is never attended with ulceration and erosion of their substance. Let their purulent collections be ever so considerable, these mem- branes will constantly remain uninjured; their tissue will only be more or less thickened: they emit pus in the same way as their natural serous fluids, that is to say by exhalation! How much the consistence of this fluid varies from the lacteal serum to the false membrane, the thickest and the most adherent to the surface from which its materials have been exhaled, is sufficiently known. The fluids of the serous system are most evi- dently of an albuminous nature. The instant a membrane of this system is immersed in boiling water, I have observed a whitish layer form over it; it is concrete albumine, which, on being soon after removed, leaves to the surface nearly its primitive hue. All substances calculated to coagulate albumine form a similar layer over the serous surfaces. Their albuminous nature is con- firmed by the experiments of Hewson, who had collected a few spoonfulls of these fluids from

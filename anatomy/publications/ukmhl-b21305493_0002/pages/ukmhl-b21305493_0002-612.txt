670 MUCOUS SYSTEM. as these do, from the distinct vitality that each part of this system is endowed with. To these varieties of vitality, and of vital powers, must also be referred those of their sym- pathies. Each portion of this system has a sympathetic action over the other organs proper to itself: irritation of the pituitary membrane will produce sneezing; but however much the extremity of the glands, of the rectum, &c. be excited, we cannot produce any effect, as by irri- tating the uvula. It is now the time to make an important remark respecting the stomach. No organ, as is well known, takes such an important part in sympathies as this ; the slightest affection of this important viscus extends its painful influence throughout the animal economy; the injury affects all the other parts. I even do not be- lieve there exists a more disagreeable and general trouble than that which in particular cases is then felt. That general feebleness which follows al- most immediately upon hunger is sympathetic ; the change of nutrition has not had time to pro- duce it. To the same cause must be referred the sudden increase of strength resulting from the contact of food on the mucous surface of this viscus, an increase which cannot be referred to the admission of chyle into the blood, since suffi- cient time had not elapsed.

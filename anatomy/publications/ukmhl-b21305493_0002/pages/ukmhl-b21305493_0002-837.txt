dlkmoidal system. 795 becomes soft, the water in which it was boiled is found to contain a considerable quantity of gluten, but the membrane, however, is not reduced in bulk, it is even considerably thicker. All kinds of fibres, areolee, or appearance of organization, has in this state completely disappeared, nothing remains but a membranous mass apparently ho- mogeneous, semi-transparent, and of a gelatinous nature. In this state it still retains the mucous, serous, cellular tissues, &c. the elasticity it had acquired by contracting, and remains possessed of that property through the redundant quantity of gelatine it still contains. The slightest motion impressed upon it causes a general quivering, a kind of vibration in all its parts, perfectly similar to that of calvesâ€™ feet jelly. Finally, if ebullition be still continued, nearly the whole of the gelatine is dissolved, and nothing left but a membranous residue as it were, and which will not diffuse without great difficulty. Common boiling water even will require a consi- derable length of time to reduce the skin to this state. Such are the phenomena which I have observed the human skin to undergo in boiling. Chemists have made the tissue of the dermis of several other animals the particular object of their enquiries; they have formed to themselves various ideas of its nature; they have admitted of two substances, the one fibrous, the other gela- tinous. I shall refer the reader to their books

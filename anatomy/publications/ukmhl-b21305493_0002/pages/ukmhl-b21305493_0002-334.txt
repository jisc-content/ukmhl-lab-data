292 M U SC IJ L A R * YST E M over the wide muscles of the trunk. This layer besides has nothing more than the appearance of membrane; it has not the same organization ; it disappears in infiltrations, in which cases every real membrane remains. Besides this general covering of the muscles, each skain is provided with a less, each fibre with a smaller still, each minute filament with hardly a perceptible sheath, although really existing. We might then represent to ourselves the cellular tissue of the muscles, as forming a continuation of sheaths successively decreasing. These co- verings accommodate the motions of the fibres, which they separate from each other, either by the serum of the cellulee, or by the fat they contain ; which two fluids by lubricating faci- litate their mutual motion. Frequently between these fibres the cellular tissue seems to form a kind of transverse lines, that divide them into rectangles. This disposition is particularly ob- served in the extensor proprius pollicis pedis, in the extensor communis, the fleshy bundles of which are wide and thin whenever they are dis- tended. In the greatest number of the thick muscles nothing of the kind is to be met with. The quantity of intermuscular cellular tissue varies very considerably. In general,in all the wide and long muscles, it is very abundant, it is pio- portionally less so, between the fibres of those of the vertebral furrows. Behind the neck, the

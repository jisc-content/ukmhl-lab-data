The greater part of the preceding means, which can only act in consequence of a disordered state of the vital powers, are ineffectual with respect to the skin : putrefaction, maceration, and ebullition, are the only means that will succeed. All act by dividing the prolongations extended from the dermis to the epidermis, although the mechanism by which this separation is effected is but imper- fectly known. SECTION 11. Organization, Composition, 6fc. Authors have given way to numerous con- jectures which it is unnecessary to repeat here, respecting the structure of the epidermis. The following lines will contain what has been de- monstrated by strict observation. The thickness of this membrane is, generally speaking, rather regular throughout all its parts. It has not ap- peared to me to vary in this respect according to the varieties of thickness of the skin, in the back, abdomen, or in the limbs, &c.

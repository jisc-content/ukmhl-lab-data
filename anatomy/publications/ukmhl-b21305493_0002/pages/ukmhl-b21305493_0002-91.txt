49 OSSEOUS SYSTEM, when the cause that distended the fibres has been removed, is very evident in bones. The alveolar socket, when the tooth is drawn, is seen to contract, and even to become obliterated. The reduction in thickness of the jaw, after the teeth have appeared, proceeds merely from the con- traction of its fibres, which are no longer so much distended by these bodies, because the root has not the same thickness as the crown, which before was completely contained within the jaw-bone. The maxillary sinus contracts when the fungus has been removed, or an issue given to the pus of the carious tooth, &c. &c. If death were not, in cases of hydrocephalus, too immediate a result of puncturing the head, I am convinced the bones would gradually contract to their natural state, and the cavity of the skull re-assume its usual di- mensions. When, in cases of necrosis, the dead part of a long bone has been removed, the new bone outwardly formed by the periosteum evi- dently contracts. In atrophy of the optic nerve, the foramen of that nerve becomes evidently smaller; in the same manner, the cavity of the orbit contracts, after the extirpation of a can- cerous eye. After having tied one of the carotids of a dog, I dissected the canal of that vessel: no contraction ensued, because the blood proceeding from the anastomosis dilated the artery as usual. This contraction in bones, proceeding from the VOL. II. Â£

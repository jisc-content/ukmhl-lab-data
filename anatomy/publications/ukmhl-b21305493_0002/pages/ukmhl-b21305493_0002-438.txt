396 MUSCULAR SYSTEM tissue is nearly the same as in the latter, flabby and loose ; this flaccidity is felt under the skin ; in the soleus, the gastrocnemii, the biceps, &c. it does not prevent each fibre from being dense, tough, &c. Muscular cohesion in general is in a reverse sense to the age. The muscles of the youth are firm and tight; they do not move un- der the skin. Towards the fortieth year more laxity begins to be observed, and beyond that period in the great motions the calves of the legs begin to quiver ; the thighs, and in general all the prominent parts, display also this state of flaccidity, especially if the subject be lean. The muscles also become less capable of motion in proportion as we approach old age, a period in which the least motion causes a tremor of the whole muscular system, the muscles are no longer sufficiently contracted, they are too long, as it were, for the space they fill. This appears to proceed from the contracti- lity of the tissue being reduced in the last stage of life. We may easily be convinced of it, by comparing a muscle divided transversely in a young or in an â€™aged subject; in the former, in fact, it contracts more than in the latter subject. By this contractility of the tissue, all the parti- cles of the muscle are drawn closer together during repose ; but this effect is no longer pro- duced ; the organ remains flaccid. Authors have not paid sufficient attention to that remarkable Why is this ? Because

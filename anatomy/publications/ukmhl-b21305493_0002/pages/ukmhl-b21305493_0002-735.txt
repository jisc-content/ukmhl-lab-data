GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 69 3 are developed in the liver, cysts containing serum in the kidneys, hydatids in both, and in the rest various productions, without the secretion being affected. These observations are particularly re- markable with respect to the liver : it is some- times increased to three or four times its usual size, by the growth of tumours within its sub- stance, without its tissue being augmented. This dilated tissue forms amongst these tumours a kind of partition, wherein the bile is separated as usual. The same thing happens in the kidneys, wherein cysts, containing serum, are found. Sometimes these cysts increase to such a degree, that the whole glandular tissue is destroyed, and replaced by a large pouch, separated by membranous par- titions, and filled with serum. I have three pre- parations of this kind. Blood Vessels. All the glands that are enveloped by a mem- brane, receive their arteries in every direction. A number of ramusculae, projecting from the ad- jacent vessels, plunge on all sides through the sur- faces of the salivary, pancreatic, lacrymal glands, &c. These arteries twine at first in the interstices of these lobes, ramify between the minute lobes, and finally penetrate the groins. Each has its own ; all communicate together ; so that the sub- maxillary artery, and the siblingual, are filled at

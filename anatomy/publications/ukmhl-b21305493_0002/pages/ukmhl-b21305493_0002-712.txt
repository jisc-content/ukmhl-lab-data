GLANDULAIl SYSTEM. 670 particular parenchyma from which they result does not depend upon a matter peculiar to these organs ? Glands, like every other organ, as the muscles, the bones, the mucous membranes, &c. have their tissue by which they are espe- cially characterized, a tissue in which the ar- teries communicate both with the veins and the excretory tubes. Let us go no further in our re- searches, or we shall unavoidably fall into con- jectures. Let us be satisfied with having ascer- tained the marks by which this tissue is distin- guished from all others, when acted upon with the different re-agents. We have gained a great point in having proved the characteristic attri- butes of the glandular system, without seeking for its intimate nature, which, as well as that of every other system, is concealed from us. On being dried in the air after having been cut in slices, the glandular parenchyma loses its primi- tive hue, acquires a darker shade, even blackish in the liver and in the kidneys, in whi.ch this change is chiefly owing to the blood with which these glands are permeated, since, if dried after having been cleansed of this fluid by repeated lo- tions, they remain greyish after the preparation. It is then less reduced in bulk than the greater part of the other organs. When thus dried, if dipped again in water, it will soften, and partly re-assume its primitive aspect and tendency to putrescency, which instantly begins if left in the open air.

316 muscuj.au system of that fatigue and weariness that attends ex- cessive pedestrian exertion. This sensation seems to depend upon the peculiar mode of animal sen- sibility in muscles, a sensibility which other agents are not calculated to produce, and which in this case, the permanence of contraction ren- ders very striking. In the same manner the fibrous system, sensible only to the distentions that act upon it, gives no pain when under the influence of other irritating agents. It should also be remarked, that this painful sensation produced in the muscles by too long continued a motion, is a means nature has selected Â£o warn the animal it is time to put an end to past, to avoid conse- quences that might prove fatal. Hence is the peculiar sensation arising from the distention of ligaments, intended to inform the animal to cease the distention ; hence each organ being pos- sessed of its peculiar mode of sensibility, what an incorrect idea would be conceived of the existence of this property, if mechanical and chemical agents only were selected to convey that idea. Nature has particularly accom- modated the peculiar mode of animal sensibility bestowed upon every organ, to the various uses for which that organ is intended. In phlegmasiae of the proper muscular tissue, animal sensibility is frequently exalted to the utmost degree ; the slightest contact on the skin proves very painful; the patient can hardly bear

DEBMOIDAL SYSTEM. 852 from sympathy. By this change the exhalents become connected with the blood, they are per- meated with this fluid instead of the serum they previously exhaled, and inflammation ensues. When in the summer the skin perspires, the vital powers are increased by the caloric it contains; in that state it is more likely to act sympatheti- cally upon the powers of the other systems. Hence all powerful stimulants applied to this organ are to be dreaded. A proof it is not the suppression of perspiration that is dangerous, but that the danger proceeds from an alteration of the vital powers of the skin, is that the suppres- sion of perspiration in some cases, as in those of phthisis, are never so very injurious; besides this suppression is not so easily effected, because they are not produced by a cause acting directly upon the skin. Now, if the perspiration were actually repelled, all kinds of suppressed perspi- rations would prove fatal. I have never heard that pleuritis was the consequence of the perspi- rations produced by fear, by rheumatism, ^.be- ing suppressed. The mucous fluids would also be repelled whenever pleuritis was occasioned by a draught of cold water. In general we judge by what is the most obvious : suppression of perspira- tion, inflammation of the pleura, &c. are effects, not causes. If the body did not perspire when cold was applied to the skin, inflammation would still ensue. In wounds of the head, attended with

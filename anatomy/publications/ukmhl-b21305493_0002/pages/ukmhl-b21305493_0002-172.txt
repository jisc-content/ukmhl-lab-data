130 MEDULLARY SYSTEM. peded in its motions, and different splinters were expelled with the pus. SECTION IV. Dev elopement. The vascular network of which this system is composed, is met with in the cartilaginous state ; but then, on the one hand, it does not admit of the red part of the blood, and on the other, the inter- stices of its meshes are so completely filled with gelatine, that the cartilage presents an homoge- neous appearance. At the epoch of ossification, on one part the red blood penetrates the vessels, whilst on the other, these vessels are left bare by the absorption of gelatine, where the cellulee are, upon the internal surface of which they twine. In the foetus, and in the early period of infancy, this medullary system displays a very remarkable disposition. It hardly contains any of that oily substance from which it borrows its name, and which subsequently fills with such abundance the interstices of the cancelli in the different bones. I have easily convinced myself of this, by com- paring these organs at the different stages of life ; 1st. When exposed to rather a considerable de- gree of heat, that oily juice melts and flows in abundance from the cancelli of the bone of an adult subject. From the same experiment ap-

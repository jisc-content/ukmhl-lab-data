131 MEDULLA It Y SYSTEM. plied to the foetus, the only result is desiccation of this tissue from the evaporation of the fluids with which it was permeated ; 2dly. If the ex- tremity of a long bone of an adult be exposed to fire, combustion is spontaneously kept up by the oily juice that transudes through the pores of the second species, and that supports the blaze until it is exhausted. In the foetus the bone will cease burning as soon as it is taken from the fire, because the fluids it contains are not calculated for combustion; 3dly. Nothing is more difficult than to keep the bones of an adult white, because the oil that penetrates their interstices always gives them rather a yellow appearance. In the fetus and in the infant, where this cause does not exist, the white appearance of the bone is easily obtained; 4thly. In the early years hardly any oil is extracted by ebullition from the cancelli, but a great quantity of this fluid is seen floating over the water in which that of the sub- sequent age has been boiled. The foetus in gene- ral seems totally deprived of medullary oil; it is formed after birth, and gradually increases. What fluid then acts as a substitute to this in the first stage of life ? First, a considerable quantity of blood; for generally the red hue of the medullary system is in a reverse order with the oil it con- tains, but the interstices of the cellulee also ap- pear moistened with an unknown fluid, and that k 2

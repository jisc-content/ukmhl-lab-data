Whenever the sympathetic influence is directed towards the brain, convul- sions and delirium are the consequences ; for as I have said, the state of the muscles proclaim the state of this organ. Now in this last circumstance, the will does not interfere with animal contracti- lity in exercise ; the patient could not possibly prevent himself from moving his muscles convul- sively; the sympathetic irritation of the brain overpowers the influence of the will. From this example of cerebral affection in peripneumony, although less frequent th&n in other affections, we may, however, form an idea of what takes place in every other case in which the muscles maybe convulsively agitated by the injury which any organ may sustain; by distention of the fibrous system, especially of ligaments of aponeuroses, by the cutting of the teeth, by the violent pains in the kidnies, in the salivary glands, or in the pancreas, from the presence of stone; by in- juries of the diaphragm, the nerves, &c.

This also explains why the strong passions, whose influence especially bears upon the internal organs, especially affect those situate round the epigastric region, the heart, the liver, the sto-

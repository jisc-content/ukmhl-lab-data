By these vessels the physician is informed of the state of the central organ from which they receive the impulse ; by the muscles of animal life, he ascertains also that of the central organ of that life. Observe the patients in a number of violent fevers, we shall find prostration in the morning, in the evening excessive agitation in the muscles. Now where is the seat of this revolution ? Not in the muscles, but in the brain. If on leaving the patient’s bed-side we enter the physiologist’s laboratory, we find his experi- ments perfectly coincide with the preceding ob- servations. Fy tying all the arteries that resort to the brain, vve suddenly interrupt the motions of that organ, motions indispensable to its action ; and abruptly put an end to voluntary motion and subsequently to life. By injecting through the ca- rotid and towards the head, with solutions of neutral salts, of acids, the contacts of which sub- stances are fatal to the cerebral action, I have constantly seen the animal’s death preceded by convulsive motions. The injection of water does not produce a similar effect. This fluid may, in respect to the life of the brain, be introduced with impunity into the arterial circulation if moderately injected ; but on being conveyed with VOL. II. V

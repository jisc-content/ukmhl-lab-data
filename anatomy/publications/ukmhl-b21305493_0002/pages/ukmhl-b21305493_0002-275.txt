FIB HO US SYSTEM. <233 Forms. In their conformation, they are analogous with the form of the limb, which in part they shape, and which they particularly support by prevent- ing the displacement of the subjacent partsâ€”an occurrence that, on account of the extreme laxity of the cutaneous organ, would incessantly take place : they vary in thickness ; in general the more numerous the muscles they contain the thicker they are. This explains why the fascia- lata exceeds in this respect that of the fore arm ; why the antibrachial is thicker in the anterior than in the posterior part, why the palmar and the plantar aponeuroses are so voluminous^ whilst a few fibres onlv are disseminated over the back of the hand and foot. This rule, however, ad- mits of some exceptions ; for instance, the aponeu- rotic expansion on the posterior part of the leg is not proportionate with the strength of the gas- trocnemii and of thesoleus; thus are these muscles more frequently than any others exposed to those very painful affections that constitute the cramp, and which ought to be distinguished from the pains or benumbed sensations resulting from the compression of one of the nerves in the inferior extremities, as of the ischiatic, or the external plantar, a compression proceeding from a wrong position, or any other similar cause, &c. Externally, the aponeuroses for general enve-

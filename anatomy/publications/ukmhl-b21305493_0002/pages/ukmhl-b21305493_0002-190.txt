148 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. The circumference of the cartilages we are viewing, terminates in an insensible manner over the bony surface, it dies away as it were, where the synovial membrane forsakes the bone to be reflected. The two corresponding cartilages of* a move- able articulation, are so completely disposed and moulded, the one upon the other, that in the mid- dle of the articulation they touch each other ex- actly in every direction. We all know that the central position of an articulation, is when the bone does not incline more in one direction than in the other ; and that all the muscles equally contracted, and presenting to each other an equal resistance, keep the limb equally distant from flexion and extension, from adduction and abduction, &c. &c. and forcibly maintain it in a precise medium. This is the position the limbs assume whenever muscular exertion is not commanded by the will; such, for instance, as in the foetus, during sleep, rest, &c. ; it is that also which is determined by certain convulsions, when all the muscles of a limb are agitated with equal force, by the extra- ordinary influence of the nerves, &c. In all other positions never is the contact of two articulating cartilages perfect in every part; some part of the surface of each presses more or less powerfully the parts adjacent to the articulation, and dis- tends them. The softness of the cartilaginous tissue renders this pressure more indurable ; the

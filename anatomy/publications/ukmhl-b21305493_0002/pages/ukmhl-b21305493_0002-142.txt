OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 100 After a longer space of time, organic sensibi- lity is exalted in the parenchyma of cicatrization formed by the granulations ; it then becomes con- nected with the calcareous substance, which, as well as the red part of the blood, is admitted, the latter always preceding the process of ossifi- cation. / By this it is seen that the callus is both cellular and vascular in the first period ; that it contains celltilar tissue and vessels, as well as gelatine, in the second ; that in the third, cellular tissue, vessels, gelatine, and also calcareous substance, are met with. The regular forms of the sound bone are not to be expected here, because the parenchyma of nutrition, arising irregularly over the surfaces of the organ, the exhalation and absorption of gela- tine cannot be performed in a precise and regular manner. The callus is so much the thicker as the ends have remained the further separated, because the granulations having had more space to over- run before they could meet those of the opposite part, are more extended, and have consequently absorbed more nutritive substance. If the constant motion of the fractured parts check granulation in both, or, what is the same thing, if it prevent the parenchymoe of cica- trization from uniting, notwithstanding the ex- halation of the nutritive substances in each, the

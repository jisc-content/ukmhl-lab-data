MUSCU LA R SYSTEM 346 in the nerves. When the muscles have ceased to contract, on irritating the first of these organs, they may still be acted upon through the me- dium of the others. Motion may be produced by irritating the nerves, when we can no longer act upon the spinal marrow. I never observed that the superior part of the nerve is sooner deprived of this faculty than the inferior ; but a very re- markable instance is, that certain nerves, acting under the same influence, cause a stronger con- traction in their muscles than others; such, for in- stance, is the diaphragmatic. Every muscle has already lost all power of motion during the arti- ficial excitement to which its nerves are submit- ted, yet the diaphragm can still be moved by similar means. Whilst in other parts experiments flag, in this they are still in their plenitude, which is the more striking, that during life, the organ is precisely that which is the least affected by the state of the brain, or of the spinal marrow, and it scarcely ever, as we have observed, is subject to paralysis and convulsions. By thus comparing the permanence of animal contractility, the same stimulants should con- stantly be used ; for according to those selected, the effects are more or less striking. The brain and the nerves have already ceased to be affected by chemical or mechanical agents, but still con- tinue to be powerfully influenced by the galvanic power. Irritation from metals is, above all, that

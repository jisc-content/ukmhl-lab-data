234 FIBROUS SYSTEM, lopement are contiguous with the integuments. They are united to them by a very loose tissue., so that the latter may easily slide over them in ex- terior pressure; immoveable between these mo- tions and those of the muscles, they separate them perfectly, so that the skin and the muscles that correspond to it do not, in this respect, influence each other in the least. Internally, the aponeuroses are generally united to the muscles by cellular tissue in a loose manner. From space to space they project between the different muscular layers numerous elongations, which proceed to be inserted into the bone, and which also, as they give points for insertions, en- sure the solidity 6f the envelopement of the limb. Aponeurotic Tensors. The aponeuroses for general envelopement, are nearly all provided with one or two particular muscles, that are wholly or in part attached to them, and which are intended to impart to them either a degree of tension or of laxity, as required by the state of the muscle. This disposition is remarkable in the insertion ; 1st. Of the latissi- mus dorsi and pectoralis major, with the brachial; 2dly. Of the biceps with the antibrachial; 3dly. Of the palmaris with the palmar aponeurosis; 4thly. Of the muscle of the facia-lata, with the aponeurosis of the same name; 5thly. Of

MUCOUS SYSTEM. 505 The thickness of all the mucous surfaces is re- markably increased by disease.* In the maxillary sinus I have seen it very considerably increased, and attain the thickness of half an inch in the bladder, &c. In considerable distensions of the mucous bags this thickness is very much reduced, it increases on their contracting ; the stomach in particular presents this phenomenon in these two reverse states. The softness of the mucous corion also varies astonishingly; in the fossae nasales, in the stomach, and in the intestines, it is actually a kind of or- ganized velvet. The name of velvety membrane is perfectly applicable wherever the mucous sys- tem originates; on the contrary, in the mouth, over the glands, in the nostrils, the tissue is denser and tighter, and by its nature approaches more the cutaneous corion; I am convinced that it would admit of being tanned, and much advan- tage might be derived from its use in our manufac- tories, if its surfaces were more extensive ; whilst I very much doubt of this process could pro- duce a similar phenomenon on the mucous tissue of organs deeply situate ; its softness would make it unfit to act as exterior ligaments; the slightest attempt, in fact, would be sufficient to rupture and lacerate it. The difference between its struc- ture with that of the cutaneous corion, prevents, in small-pox, the pustules from forming over them, whilst they are frequently met with over

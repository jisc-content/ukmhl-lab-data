875 DEUMOIDAL SYSTEM# human dermis becomes much stiffer in an aged subject, than in younger ones. Maceration re- quires more time to soften it; the hair by this last process is much sooner removed from the skin of an infant, than from that of an old man : this part of the tanning process is attended, as tanners have often experienced, with more labour and difficulty with old skins than with young ones# I have observed that penetrated with infinitely more hair the skin of animals when compared with that of man presents an innumerable quantity of small pores on its external surface, which allow- ing the tan to insinuate itself into the areolas of the dermis, and filling them completely with a new substance by its combination with gelatine, converts its cellular tissue into a solid one. The preparatory maceration of the hide not only facilitates the removal of the hair, but also by dis- tending the fibres of the areolae and the pores, it favours the introduction of tan. The more we advance in age, the less the skin is permeated with blood. The flush of the cheeks has passed from the aged subject. Then the pink hue observed before in the exterior habit of the youth and even of the adult, and which proceeded from the vessels twining through the cellular tissue of the areolm of the corium is no longer to be seen. The continual pressure of exterior forms then, considerably increases the adhesion of the cellular

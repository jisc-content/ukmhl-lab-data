SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 639 organs and parietes of these cavities. In every moveable articulation there are membranes perfectly similar, intended for the very same uses, not differing in their nature, and which I have called synovial because they incessantly exhale and absorb synovia. Forms. Every synovial membrane then should be con- sidered as an imperforated sac, formed over the organs of articulation, over the inter-articular cartilages, the internal surface of the lateral and capsular ligaments, the whole of the inter-articu- lar ligaments wherever they exist, and over the greazy bundles rather pre-eminent in some of the articular cavities, &c. It is from them these divers organs borrow that smooth, polished and shining appearance they are characterized by in these cavities, and which the}? do not possess in other parts. As by nicely dissecting the gastric organs, the peritoneum might be removed, and left per- fectly entire; so may we conceive the possibility of separating even this membrane, were it not for the intimate adhesions it contracts in different parts. All the parts it invests are without the articulating cavity, although projecting into that cavity, as the lungs are placed external to the sac iormed by the pleura, the liver external to that of the peritoneum, &c. &c.

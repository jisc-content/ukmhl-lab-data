79 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. SECTION IV. Of the Means of Union in the Articulating Surfaces. The articulating- surfaces would soon be parted , if different organs did not retain them together. These organs are the cartilages and the mem- branes for immoveable articulations, the liga- ments and muscles for the others. Union of the Immoveable Articulations. The two first orders of the immoveable articu- lationsâ€”those with inserted surfaces, and those with surfaces in juxta-position, are provided with cartilages interposed between the bony surfaces, so much the thicker and wider as we are nearer to infancy. Nearly all the bones of the head are held together in this manner, which allows them to yield in some degree to the mechanical efforts they may be exposed to, and which consequently prevents their being fractured. In the articulations of the pelvis there are ligaments as well as cartilages, but as these articulations perform in some cases, slight mo- tions of gliding, they may be considered as an intermediate class between the moveable and im- *

SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 632 mixture composed of two different fluids, conveyed to the articulations. The greater part of those who followed him adopted his opinion on this head. Even those who, like Desault, denied the existence of articulating glands, and there- fore that synovia is secreted, admitted of its transudation, grounding themselves on the follow- ing observations. 1st. A long bone, stript of its marrow parts, and exposed to the air, suffers a greasy transudation to escape through the pores of its cartilages, and ceasing only when the medullary juice is completely exhausted. 2dly. The mechanical compression of the cartilaginous extremity of a long bone will, for the time, pro- duce a similar phenomenon. Are these facts, so evident in a dead bone, as evident in a living one ? Divers considerations I am about to lay down, induce me to believe the reverse. 1st. The vital powers, the effect of which is to impart to every organ, animated by them, a de- gree of tone sufficient to oppose the approach of fluids, leave, on being annihilated, the fibres of these very organs in a state of laxity, admitting everywhere of being permeated. Thus transuda- tion at present is considered peculiar to the dead body, a process which cannot be considered vital without admitting of an evident deviation from the laws of nature, characterized by simplicity and uniformity. In the experiment previously related, the greasy transudation is effected not

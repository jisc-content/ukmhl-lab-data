This observation is easily verified in quadrupeds, birds, and even fishes, dressed for our meals. Without acquiring so strong a smell, the flesh of the latter is in similar instances flabby and taste- less. SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Muscular System of Animal Life. Cellular Tissue. The muscular tissue, is abundantly supplied with cellular tissue: I even know of no system, that in proportion, is so plentifully provided for. This tissue forms a very considerable layer, round every muscle; it is most generally loose, filled with fat, easily distended with air in emphysema, and with serum in anasarca: sometimes it is den- ser, tighter, and actually spread in the form of a membrance ; as that, for instance, which covers the obliquus externus deseenden, on which ac- count this part of dissection is rather difficult for the young student. The other muscles of the abdo- men, the trapezius, the serratus major, and the great dorsal are also similarly disposed. It might be thought that nature had intended this as a substitute for aponeuroses, that are wanting u 2

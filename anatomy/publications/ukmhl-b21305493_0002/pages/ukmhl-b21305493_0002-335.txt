OF ANIMAL LIFE. 293 spienius, the coinplexus, &care much more sparingly provided than many others, particularly in the spaces by which they are separated. Sometimes rather considerable cellular exten- sions are found amongst the muscles, and seem to divide them by halves ; sucliis that, which sepa- rates the clavicular portion of the pectoral is major : this even, has sometimes puzzled anato- mists, with regard to the division of these organs. In general the muscles are fixed in their re- spective positions by the cellular tissue ; the art of dissecting proves fhis fact. The collections of pus, frequently fulfil the office of the knife, and are also additional proofs of its use, an use which does not preclude motion in all directions, of which the excessive extensibility of the cellular tissue admits. The cellular tissue not only binds the muscles together, but also unites each of their fibres with those adjoining ; it is compressed during their contraction and lengthens when they are distended : if deprived of this tissue, their motions become inefficient and irregular. I have frequently by the knife separated a mus- cle laid bare in a living animal into several small skains ; and on causing subsequently this muscle to contract by irritating the marrow with an in- strument passed into the medullary cavity, I have remarked these irregular motions. If we divide, in a longitudinal direction, the muscle of a limb from its superior to the inferior tendon, into two or

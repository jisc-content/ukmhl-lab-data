630 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM, self, although he ascribed to these bodies a glan~ dular structure, has acknowledged this truth. The existence of these ducts is not better ascer- tained by the transudation of fluids injected through the arteries surrounding the articulation, than the same experiment could establish this fact in the cavities of the serous membranes, where this transudation also takes place, and wherein it is sufficiently proved there are no glands, othly. These greasy forms are completely resolved into cellular tissue by inflation, and the same effect is produced by maceration When ebulli- tion, gradually produced and long continued, has completely stript these bodies of fat, there is nothing left but a mass of collapsed cellulae, similar to those of the common cellular tissue. Gthly, In certain affections the glandular form is proclaimed by a particular induration and tume- faction, of which other organs, as the muscles, tendons, &c. never afford examples. The liver, the kidneys, the salivary organs, all evident glands in short, are remarkable in this respect. Such even is the power of this character, that it helps to point out the existence of glands previously imperceptible in their natural state. For instance, the existence of the cryptae of the stomach, ure- thra, and of several other mucous membranes, is grounded, first, upon analogy ; but more particu- larly on the accidental developement of these bodies in particular diseases.

* GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. the muscular systems of animal life, the cartila- ginous, and the fibrous, are especially intended for the purpose of locomotion ; thus the serous, mucous, organic, muscular systems, &c. are par- ticularly intended for purposes of digestion, re- spiration, and circulation. Thus, the glandular system forms the secretions; thus, again, the cu- taneous system forms an essential part of the ex- ternal sensitive apparatus, &c. All the systems that remain to be considered, are then much i more isolated, and act a less extended part than those we have been examining. Restricted to particular parts, they do not interfere with the others, they are possessed of a separate vitality, whilst in every part the primitive systems add their mode of vitality to that of every organ they contribute to form. The greatest number enjoy a mode of existence and exterior forms that dis- tinguish them from the latter; the different parts that compose each, are most generally insulated, nor are they connected together. The bones, the muscles of animal and of organic life, the cartilages, the fibro-cartilage, the medullary or- gans, the glands, the serous membranes, hair, &c. display this insulated state in a striking light. Each part belonging to these different systems, is constantly separated from the other parts of the same system, by a number of intermediate organs of a very different nature, and conse- quently belonging to other systems.

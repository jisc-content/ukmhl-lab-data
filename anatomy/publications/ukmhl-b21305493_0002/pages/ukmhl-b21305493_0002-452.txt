MUSCULAR SYSTEM 410 that we have seen, round these vessels, a real ner- vous membrane superadded to their own, and exclusively intended for them. I compare this nervous sheath with the cellular envelopement of the arteries, which is perfectly distinct from the adjacent cellular tissue ; hence this has nothing more than communications with the nerves of the organic muscles, without being otherways dis- tributed to these muscles; besides, as the nerves of the ganglions are constantly the most essential and the most numerous, they are excessively fine, the nervous mass intended for each is much inferior to that in the voluntary muscles. The heart and the deltoid muscle, on being compared together, display in this respect a very remarkable difference. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Muscular System of y Organic Life. In respect to its properties, this system is partly similar to the preceding, and in part distinct from it. SECTION i. Properties of the Tissueâ€”Extensibility. In the muscles of organic life extensibility is very conspicuous. The dilatation of the intestines

I have seen the tunica ,V; arachnoides in a corpse evidently attached to the internal surface of the dura-mater, without this Â»-i# having undergone the least alteration: it was easily removed and lacerated with the utmost facility. SECTION III. Serous Fluids. The internal surface of all the serous mem- branes is moistened with a fluid nearly re- sembling the serum of the blood. This fluid is incessantly poured out by the exhalents, and constantly taken up by the absorbents. Its quan- tity varies ; merely a dew in the natural state, it evaporates whenever the serous membranes laid bare suffer the air to dissolve it. It is generally more abundant in the corpse than in the living subject, because the transudation prevented by the tonic powers is then easily prevented on account of the loss of these powers, and is sub- stituted to vital exhalation, in mechanically trans- mitting, by their weight, the fluids of the ad- joining organs to the different serous cavities; and because this very decline of the tonic powers prevents any kind of absorption whatever; hence, the stagnation, the accumulation of this fluich

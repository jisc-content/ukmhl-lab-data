600 / SEROUS SYSTEM. aspect, the texture, and even the very nature of which, are absolutely the same (as we have seen) as in the serous membranes, always arise amidst the cellular tissue, grow at its expence, and are completely formed by it. 4thly. No fibres are ever met with in the serous membranes; a dis- tinctive character of the other organs, and similar to that of the cellular tissue. To these divers proofs of analogy between the cellular and serous systems, might be added the action of the different re-agents, the results of which are perfectly similar in both. 1st. Every serous membrane after having undergone desicca- tion becomes transparent, but never yellow like the fibrous membranes : they retain a suppleness never met with in these last membranes, nor in the mucous that have undergone the same prepa- ration, and will by degrees re-assume their primi- tive state on being again immersed in water. 2dly. They do not so easily yield to putrefaction as the mucous surfaces, the muscular layers, the glands, Ac. This is particularly remarkable in the abdomen, on the peritoneum often left almost completely healthy, whilst every thing around is putrefied, as may be ascertained by removing it; for the transparency, if examined on the fleshy and. mucous layers, might at first glauce lead us to suppose it is injured. 3dly. In the gene- ral temperature of cellars the serous membranes cannot be reduced to a pulpous state by mace-

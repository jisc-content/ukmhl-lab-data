541 MUCOUS SYSTEM. duced by carbonic acid gas, hydrogen and at- mospheric air, instances in which the redness of the blood does not differ much from its natural degree. But in other instances, oxygen has not the slightest influence upon the colour of the blood; so that, alhough a multiplicity of experi- ments have been repeated on this head, I can point out no general result. It seems the tonic powers of the cellular tissue, and of the vascular parieties ramifying in this tissue, receive a very variable influence from the contact of gases, and that according to the nature of this influence, the fibres shrinking and contracting more or less, render these parts more or less liable to be per- meated by aerial fluids, that tend to escape from the blood to unite with those producing the em- physema, or by this last fluid, if it tend to com- bine with the blood, which undoubtedly caused the varieties I have observed. The red hue of the mucous system is analogous to that of the muscular system. It does not es- sentially proceed from the blood circulating in the minute arteries of this system: it proceeds from the colouring part of the blood being com- bined with the mucous tissue, particularly in the depth of the organs; for at the origin of the mu- cous surfaces, the principal cause of this colour will appear to arise from the circulation of the blood : in fact, the deep seated mucous surfaces are not made as livid by asphyxia as those super-

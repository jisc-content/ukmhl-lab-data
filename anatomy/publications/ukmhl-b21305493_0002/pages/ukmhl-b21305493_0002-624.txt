SGKOUS SYSTEM. 582 possible to dissect them over their respective sur- faces, would be removed perfectly uninjured. This bag is, in this respect, similar to the double nightcap; a trifling simile, but which, however, conveys a correct idea of the formation of these membranes. From this general disposition, it is easily con- ceived that the serous membranes never open to give passage to the vessels and nerves that pene- trate their respective organs, but that by doubling they constantly attend them to the organs, thus providing them with a sheath, which prevents them from being contained within their cavities; which opposes the infiltration of the serum that lubricates them ; an infiltration which would un- avoidably take place through the adjacent cellular tissue, in dropsies particularly, if, as with the fibrous membranes, they were perforated for the passage of these vessels and nerves. This dispo- sition, exclusivelv remarkable in the membranes now under consideration, and in the synovial membranes, is evident on the vessels that pene- trate the lungs, the spleen, the intestines, the stomach, the testes, &c. This is very conspicu- ously displayed in the tunica arachnoides, a mem- brane essentially serous, as I have proved else- where. From the general idea that has been given of these membranes, it may also be conceived how almost all of them are composed of two distinct

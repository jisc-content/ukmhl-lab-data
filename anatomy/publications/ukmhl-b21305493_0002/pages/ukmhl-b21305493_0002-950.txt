EPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM* 908 ARTICLE III. Nails. / All the fingers are provided, at their extremi- ties, with hard, transparent, and elastic blades, of a nature similar to that of horns in different animals. SECTION i. r - . â€¢ Forms, Extent, Connections, The nails of the human species differ from those of the major part of other animals; first in width, then in their tenuity. In the first respect they are calculated to protect the extremities of the fingers, which are wider than in a number of ani- mals, for the better perfection of touch. In the second, they seem less intended either for attack or defence. The inhabitants of most nations cut their nails on a level with their fingers, so that they do not present in that state their natural strength. Left to nature, they grow by bending in the flexor direction, and completely cover the interior ex- tremity of the finger. This growth has deter- mined limits, which the nail never exceeds, and which this organ has reached when its extremity is sharp and pointed ; but as long as it bears the appearance of a section the nail continues to grow.

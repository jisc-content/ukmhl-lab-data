Not only the mucous system bears without danger the contact of all substances that are ad- mitted into the economy, but also whenever it is forced outward, it may, without injury, be ex- posed to external stimulants. Let us only ob- serve what takes place in prolapsus uteri, when the whole membrane of the vagina is sometimes forced out in eversions of the intestinal canal, in the artificial anus, in falls upon the rectum, &c. Then the mucous surfaces actually fill the office of inte- guments, but surrounding bodies do not act more painfully upon them than upon the skin. On the contrary, the moment a serous surface is laid bare, as in the operation of hernia for instance, wherein the intestine is exposed in consequence of an opening accidentally made by the point of the knife, this surface unavoidably inflames. All the cellular, muscular, nervous, or glandular parts, &c. laid bare, present the very same phenome- non ; the opening of the bladder is, in respect to the contact of air, unattended with danger, whilst the utmost danger would exist in suffer- ing this fluid to penetrate an articulating cavity, a tendinous sheath, a serous bag, &c. We are aware how necessary it is to avoid wounding the peritoneum in the high operation- for the stone ; how uncertain is the result of emphysema,

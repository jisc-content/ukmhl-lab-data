FIBKOUS SYSTEM. 193 ARTICLE III. Properties of the Fibrous System. section r. Physical Properties. In the natural state, the fibrous system hardly admits of any elasticity ; but when removed from the body, and its different organs are submitted to desiccation, they acquire this faculty in a very evident degree. Thus, the tendons, the aponeu- rotic shreds, &c. which in a fresh state could admit of no vibration at all, are made capable of resounding in musical instruments, when very much dried. SECTION II. Properties of the Tissue. The properties of the tissue are evident in the fibrous system, but less so than in many others. Extensibility of the dura-mater is demonstrated in hydrocephalus; of the periosteum, in the dif- ferent obstructions that affect the bones ; of the aponeurosis, in the various tumefactions of the limbs; in the distensions of the abdominal pari- etes, which, as is well known, are as much apo- neurotic as fleshy; of the fibrous capsules, in dropsy of the articulations : of the tunica scleroti- vol. ii. o

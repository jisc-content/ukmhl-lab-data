MUCOUS SYSTEM. 575 birth all the apertures of the mucous membranes open, and suffer the mecomium, urine, and all the mucous juices to escape. This internal and general commotion, which empties all the mucous cavities, prepares them for the important func- tions they are soon to perform. When once all the functions are in a state full of activity, the mucous surfaces no longer expe- rience abrupt changes, similar to that I have just been mentioning ; as the other viscera they increase in a slow and insensible manner: they retain for a long time their primitive softness, a softness very remarkable, particularly in the nose, stomach, <Â£c.; and which whilst the child suckles, were not adapted to come in contact with solid substances; indispensable food to the adult. Is this softness a cause of the mucous affections in general so very common at that stage of life ? We are aware that the mucous juices abound at that time ; the pituitary membrane is more moist; that the stomach and intestines are frequently af- fected by a kind of catarrh, causing those purgings which we have so frequently to counteract in infants. The membrane of the bronchia is also frequently diseased. The two extreme stages of life have much resemblance with each other, in the abundant quantity of mucous juices that are separated upon their respective surfaces. In youth, the action of the mucous system is very energetic. Active hemorrhages are re-

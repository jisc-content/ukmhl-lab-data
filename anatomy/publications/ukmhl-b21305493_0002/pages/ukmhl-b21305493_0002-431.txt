389 OF ANIMAL LIFE. exterior habit, with the exception of all such causes as might influence conformation, is in this respect quite different in a youth from that of an adult. The exterior conformation of an infant and a young man, is in general very analogous with that of the female. Although we are not so perfectly acquainted with the difference of substances that penetrate the muscles in infants and the adult, as with those of the bones, where the addition of the calcareous phosphate to the gelatine presents such a striking phenomenon in respect to nutrition, yet it cannot be doubted that these differences most inevitably exist. Submitted to ebullition, combustion, ma- ceration, &c. the flesh of the foetus doesnot yield the same results as that of the adult. Broth made from the muscles of a young ani- mal contains much more gelatine, a substance that predominates so much at that stage of life, and has much less flavour than that from adult animals, and consequently there appears to be less extractive substance in the muscular system. Veal broth is characterized by a flat taste, which is disagreeable even to some persons. The differ- ence of the principles it contains influences even the gastric organs, which they cause to contract; they open the body, as it is called, a phenome- non never produced by other broths. It does not appear that iibrine is over abundant in muscles at

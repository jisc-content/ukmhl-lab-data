FIBROUS SYSTKM. 238 thickness is much less than that of the preceding ; it is calculated for the efforts they are intended to bear. All the aponeuroses are provided with ten- sors, that proportion their degree of tension or relaxation to the powers of the adjacent mus- cles. The rectus anterior, by means of its inser- tions, in common with the pyramidalis, fulfil this office in regard to the abdominal aponeuroses ; the serrati minores in respect to that which covers the muscles of the vertebral gutters ; the auricu- lar, the frontal, and the occipital, in respect to the epicranial, &c. The aponeuroses for envelopement, the use of which is exclusively restricted to a single muscle, as that of the temporal for instance, are un- provided with tensors, and are consequently al- ways in the same degree of tension : this pro- bably explains why they have a very tight and thick tissue, as that which I have just men- tioned. In general, the use of all aponeuroses for enve- lopement, whether general or particular, in what relates to compression of the muscles, is ren- dered indispensable by the displacements they would be exposed to in contractingâ€”displacements rendered obvious; 1st. When we place the handover a muscle in action, which is unprovided with an aponeurosis, such as the masseter ; 2dly. When some part of a general aponeurosis having been

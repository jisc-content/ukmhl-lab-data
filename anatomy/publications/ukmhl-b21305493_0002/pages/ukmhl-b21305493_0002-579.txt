537 MUCOUS SYSTEM. kV of blood is nearly always the same, the rapidity of circulation might be increased, and consequently, that in a limited time more of this fluid may be con- veyed during the plenitude, which seems requisite for the more abundant secretion of the mucous fluids then performed; a secretion, which is pro- duced by the presence of substances in contact with the membrane from which they originate : for in- stance, it cannot be called in question, but that three or four times the quantity of mucous is separated in the urethra when filled with the bougie, than when this canal is free, and, of course, the blood must be in proportion. The remarkable redness of the mticous system, the analogy of respiration where the blood flows through the mucous surface of the bronchia, the well-known experiment of a bladder filled with blood, and placed in oxygen gas, when this fluid is also dyed of a red colour, have induced us to be- lieve that the blood, in certain mucous surfaces, be- ing separated from atmospheric air, by a slight pel- licle only, as in the pituitary membrane,the palate, I the glands, &c. assumed also in these parts a deeper red, either by clearing itself of a portion of car- bonic acid gas, or by combining with the oxygen of the air, and that these membranes thus ful- filled functions attributed to the lungs. The ex- periments of Jurine on the cutaneous organs, ex- periments adopted by several eminent physicians, seem also to enforce this opinion.

694 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. once, by injecting through the medium of small tubes contained in the submental, in the external maxillary under the maxillary ridge, or in the lingual, quite as effectually as if the injection had been forced through the very trunk of the ex- ternal carotid. \ In glands inclosed within a membrane, as the liver, the kidneys, the testes, &c. the arteries enter at one side only, generally in a fissure more or less deep, and by a single trunk, which is very considerable ; sometimes they divide into several branches of different sizes. That part of the gland through which the artery penetrates, is always the farthest removed from the injurious operation of mechanical causes, a remark referable to all the important organs, as the lungs, intestines, spleen, &c. which, without exception, present their convex surface, that in which the vessels ramify. It should also be remarked, that the glandular system is much less liable to frequent causes of distention and contraction than the sys- tems possessed of distinct fibres; it is only when abscesses, serous, steatomatous collections, &c. form in the interior of these organs, and which frequently occur in the centre of the liver, of the kidneys, &c.; it is only then, I say, it is distended : now, in this case, it does not yield like the skin, muscles, &c.; its particles separate from each other; it is the cellular tissue in which they are immerged which uniformly dilates ; the glandular

699 GLANDULAK SYSTEM. blood is observed in the mucous glands, the prostate, testes, and tonsils. 3dly. The liver and kidneys are so liberally supplied with blood, that, in respect to this fluid, no kind of proportion is left between these organs, and the remainder of the glandular system. In the first organ, this rather depends upon the cause above alluded to, thus it sometimes contains a much greater quan- tity than the second, but this is not the essential cause. The same thing is observed when death has been produced by hemorrhage, when no reflux is observed in the liver or kidneys suddenly removed from a living animal. On submitting these glands to maceration, the water requires to be renewed at least ten or twelve times before it ceases to be bloody. Hence, when some organic disease of these organs are intended to be pre- served in spirits, they must be macerated for a considerable time, or the spirit would soon be thickened with blood. It is owing' to this profu- sion of blood, that these glands aro proportionally heavier than other parts of the body, and from the same cause they derive their red colour, a colour which is not so void in other parts, but which is not more inherent in their tissue than that of the mucous surfaces, or of muscles. In fact, by repeated washing it is removed with equal faci- lity. Then, the liver displays a grayish aspect, which appears to be the colour of its tissue, as ' white is that of the fleshy fibre.

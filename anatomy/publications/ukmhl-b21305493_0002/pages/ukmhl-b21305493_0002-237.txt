FIBROUS SYSTEM. 195 neuroses m certain rure cases, 1 elated by divei& authors, See. Sec. It will be easily conceived that the great resistance with which the fibrous system is endowed, is essentially owing to this impossibi. lity of yielding abruptly to the given impulse. In the slow and gradual extension that fibrous organs admit of, it is observed, that irecjuentlv far from being reduced in thickness, of extending their surface at the expence of this dimension, their thickness, on the contrary, is increased. The tunica albuginea scirrhus testis, the tunica sclerotica of a dropsical or cancerous eye, the periosteum of a rickety bone, &c. : display these phenomena, the reverse of which is sometimes observed, as in the distensions of the abdominal aponeurosis, produced by pregnancy, by acute dropsy in hydrocephalus, &c. The contractility of the tissue is accommodated in the fibrous system to its mode of extensibility : as it cannot be suddenly distended, so it cannot abruptly contract when distension ceases. This fact is striking in the section of a tendon, of the aponeurotic portion of a ligament laid bare in a living animal, in the incision of the dura-mater, to give an outlet to blood under this mem- brane, &c. In all these cases the divided surfaces admit but of a very trifling separation : thus in the rupture of a tendon, division being produced, not by the contraction of the divided surfaces, but o 2

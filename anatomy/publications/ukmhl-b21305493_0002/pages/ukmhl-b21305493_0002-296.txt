254 FIBUO-CART1LAGINOOS SYSTEM. impression. They may be called tibro-cartilages of the tendinous sheaths. These three classes of fibro-cartilages, although extremely analogous, have not exactly the same structure, the same vital properties, or the same vitality j so that the system they form is not so homogeneous in its different divisions as the os- seous system, the muscular system of animal life, &c. ARTICLE II. Organization of the Fi hro - Carti la gin ous System. SECTION I. Tissue proper to the Fibro-Cartilaginous System, The tissue peculiar to the fibro-cartilaginous sys- tem is composed, as its name sufficiently implies, of a fibrous substance, and also of real cartilage. The fibrous substance forms the basis of the organ as it were: this basis is perfectly dis- tinct in the fibro-cartilage of the tendinous grooves, and of the articulations, particularly in those of the body of the vertebrae, but is not near so apparent in the membranous fibro-cartilages. Sometimes it is interwoven, at other times dis- posed in a parallel direction. In general its nature is absolutely the same as in the fibrous system, hard, resistant, dense and tight: hence

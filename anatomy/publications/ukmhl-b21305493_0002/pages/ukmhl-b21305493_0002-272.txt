FIBROUS SYSTEM. 230 phalanges ; the others merely form rings, in which a tendon is reflected, the great oblique of the eye is an instance. In general they all describe a semi-circle, and form a kind of semi-canal, completed by the bone in the opposite part, in such a manner that the tendon slides into a canal which is partly bony and partly fibrous. This canal is lined with a sy- novial membrane, the adherence of which with the fibrous sheath is equal to that of the articu- lating synovial organ with its capsule. In their external surfaces, the fibrous sheaths correspond to the adjacent organs, with which they are united by a loose cellular tissue. All these sheaths are composed of a very dense and tight tissue; they are stronger in propor- tion to the efforts of the tendons that act upon them than the fibrous capsules are in respect to the various impulsions of the bones, and which tend to lacerate these capsules. At their two edges they are confounded with the periosteum. Those of the flexors also unite their ends with the expansions of the tendons: thus is that very remarkable fibrous intersection, ob- served at the extremities of the last phalanges, accounted for. These kinds of sheaths in the limbs are met with in respect to the flexors only ; the extensors are not provided with them. This, on the one part, proceeds from two tendons of the iirst species be-

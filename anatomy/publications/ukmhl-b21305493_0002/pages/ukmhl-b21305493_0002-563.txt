521 MUCOUS SYSTEM. mach emitting a distinct fluid by the way of se- cretiou: but this assertion is not substantially demonstrated, and at some future time it may be proved, that this juice, so very different from other mucous juices, is, however, a mucous juice, differing in properties only, because the structure of the mucous surface of the stomach differs from that of all other similar surfaces. The functions of the mucous fluids in the eco- nomy are not doubtful. The most essential, is to protect the mucous membranes from the im- pression of bodies with which they are in con- tact, every one of which, as we have seen, are foreign to that of the animal. These fluids form over the respective surfaces a layer, compen- sating, in some degree, for the excessive tenu- ity, nay, even for the deficiency of their epi- dermis. Thus, wherever this membrane is very apparent, as over the lips, on the glands, in the nostrils, and in general wherever the mucous membranes originate, these fluids are not over- abundant. The skin is moistened merely with an oily fluid much inferior to the mucus wTe are now considering, because it has a strong epi- dermis. This use of the mucous fluids, explains why they are more abundant where the excretions stagnate for some time, as in the bladder, in the extremity of the rectum, &c. than in the ureters, and in general in all the excretory ducts.

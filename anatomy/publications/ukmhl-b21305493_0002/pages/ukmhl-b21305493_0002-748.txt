706 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. disappeared. Nothing more remains but a cel- lular and membranous cyst. The hydatids which are so frequent in the exterior of the kidneys present some examples. If the cyst be formed in the middle of a gland, the destruc- tion is also real, but it is also much less conspi- cuous. An evident proof of the slight extensibility of the glands, is what occurs in the liver of the corpse. I have already remarked, that it is more or less gorged with blood, accordingly as the system of the dark blood has been more or less obstructed previous to death. Now whatever quantity of fluid it may contain, its volume re- mains nearly the same, its tissue only being more or less compressed by the blood vessels ; whilst on the contrary the comparative volume of the lungs, which is very evident, invariably indicates their fulness or vacuity. It is probable even, that it is this difference which induced physicians to pay no regard to the state of obstruction in the liver, which varies so remarkably at the moment of death, whilst they have especially noticed these varieties in the lungs. Placed at a greater distance from the heart, the veins of the kidneys are less exposed than those of the liver to any reflux at the instant of death, when the veinous circulation meets with obstacles in crossing the lungs. This, however, is still effected, and considerable varieties in the

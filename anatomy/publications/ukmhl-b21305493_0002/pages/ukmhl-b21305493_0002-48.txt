OSSEOUS SYSTEM. % This system, remarkable amongst all others for its hardness and power of resistance, borrows from that twofold property the faculty of serv- ing as a common basis on which other parts rest, and around which they are suspended, as it were, and fixed. The assemblage of the component parts, bound together for that purpose by supple and resisting ligaments, compose a whole termed the skeleton. That bony assemblage, situate amidst the crowd of organs it supports, every where continued in all its parts, is not, however, as the primitive systems, endowed throughout with a similar vitality. The ligaments that con- nect these different parts, very distinct from them both in nature and properties, produce therein a distinct vitality, which does not exist in the dif- ferent parts of the systems above described, be- cause their nature is every where the same.

Hence proceed three distinct classes that present varieties, both in their forms, in their organiza- tion, Sec. ARTICLE I. Of the Forms of the Cartilaginous System. * / These forms vary according to the class to which the cartilages belong. SECTION i. Form of the Cartilages in the moveable Ar- ticulations. In every moveable articulation, each end of the bone is provided with a cartilage that encloses it; facilitating, by its smoothness, the motion of the two bones, which, on account of their hardness, would, in rubbing, experience too violent a shock. This reflects a considerable part of the motion, which thus becomes more extended ; by yielding a little, it moderates the effects of the violent shocks to which the limbs are \i VOL. II.

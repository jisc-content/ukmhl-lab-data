FIBROUS SYSTEM. <229 When, in cases of unreduced luxations, the head of the bone has forsaken the articulating cavity, a new membrane forms round this head in the cellular tissue, and thus provides it with a cap- sule ; but this membrane is not of the same texture as the first. I have observed, that in two diffe- rent subjects no fibres could be traced; that its tissue was completely similar to that of the dif- ferent cysts frequently met with in various parts of the economy, particularly to those that form round the substances unconnected with the sys- tem, the presence of which has not produced suppuration, and, consequently, that these unnatu- ral productions belong rather to the class of se- rous than to that of the fibrous membranes. ARTICLE VII. \ Fibrous Sheaths. The fibrous sheaths, as we have said, are di- vided into partial and general. section i c Partial Fibrous Sheaths., The partial sheaths intended for a single ten- don are of two species. Some have rather a con- siderable distance to over-run ; such are, those of the flexors of the foot and of the hand, which ^01 respond with the whole concave surface of the

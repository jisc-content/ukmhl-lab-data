MUSCULAR SYSTEM 370 the current of blood is increased by the motions of the arm. 7thly. The colour of the muscle, however, is not changed ; this proceeds from its not being the colouring portion of the blood circulated with this fluid in the vessels of muscles that supplies them with colour, but, as I have said before, that which exists in their tissue, and is combined with their fibres. Now this colouring matter remains the very same either in the state of contraction or in that of relaxation. The heart of a frog fades on contracting; but this is because the blood it contained is evacuated, and by the trans- parency of its parieties, the phenomenon is dis- played very obviously. 8thly. On contracting, the muscles disclose a multiplicity of small transverse wrinkles, parti- cularly striking in oscillatory contractions, less apparent in those which are complete, and nearly wanting in a muscle that is laid bare in a living animal, as it contracts with some degree of force. 9thly. Authors have considered contractions too uniformly : they have described their pheno- mena in such a manner, as to suppose that in every instance the muscular contraction is the same; but the state of a muscle at that time ad- mits of a multiplicity of distinctions; 1st. Slow and almost insensible contraction, produced by the contractility of tissue, whenever a muscle has

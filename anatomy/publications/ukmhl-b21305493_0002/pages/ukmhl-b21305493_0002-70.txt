28 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. all over its surface so as to stop the apertures, then exposed to the sun, the medullary juice pre- vented from transuding through the external pores will, after crossing the celluleÂ©, flow from the divided part. 3dly. By varnishing a dried bone, and opening it in two opposite parts, air, water, and every kind of fluid, after crossing these communications, will flow through both aper- tures. We may then conceive the interior of every bone as forming a general cavity, filled with a number of intersecting fibres. I have observed no material difference in the direction of these fibres in the three species of bones. Compact Tissue. It is not the same with the fibres of the compact tissue, as with those of the preceding; these fibres in juxta-position leave no spaces between them, giving by their tight adherence, a remarkable density to the tissue they form, in a longitudinal direction; in long bones divergent, and radiating in the flat; they intersect each other in every di- rection in the short bones. This threefold dispo- sition of the fibres in the compact tissue, seems completely to proceed from the mode of ossifica- tion. In fact, if its progress be studied in the pri- mitive cartilages, these organs are seen to impreg- nate themselves with calcareous phosphates, in

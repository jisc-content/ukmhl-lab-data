The aneurismal heart always remains the same. Now is the time to distinguish properly those enlargements produced by extensibility ; as those of the right auricle and ventricles for instance, which are filled with blood at the moment of death, because the lungs being weakened, and not admitting a free circulation of this fluid, it is repelled towards its source. Th^re are few hearts indeed that do not present these dilatations in very variable degrees, which may be increased or lessened at will, according to the nature of the death. In the dissecting room two hearts are rarely found alike ; a number of varieties are met with, and these varieties are derived from the degree of obstruction to the blood during the last moments in crossing the lungs. This explains why, in the affections of the heart, we have no criterion by which every morbid increase might be compared, (particularly if the organ be examined as a whole. In fact, the distention of the right part may give it an aneurismal appearance, and a volume superior even to that of certain aneurisms. If the left part be considered in an isolated manner, the error in this disease is the better ascertained, because this part admits of less variations. But the essential difference is in the thickness ; the energy of con-

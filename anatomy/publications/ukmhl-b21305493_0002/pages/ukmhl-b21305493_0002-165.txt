123 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. where these bones must exist, us in any other. Their organization in general is uniform. Shortly after birth, rather more gelatine than is required for the peculiar nutrition of these two fibrous bodies, begins to be exhaled in those parts which afterwards becoming ossified, form the sesamoid bones; then cartilages essentially distinct from those of common ossifications are formed, which are nearly of the same nature as those of the ends of the long bones in the adult, whilst these actually belong to the class of fibrocartilaginous substances. In their nature they resemble the inarticular fibro-cartilage, those of the tendinous insertions, &c. They are not cartilages, but ac- tually fibrous cartilages of ossification, the fibrous bases of which are more readily discovered, as they are examined nearer to the time of their de- velopement. State of Bone. By degrees, the vessels of this fibro-cartilagi- nous bases, that hitherto circulated white fluids only, become connected with the blood, and are permeated with this fluid; at the same time the cal- careous phosphate begins to be deposited ; then cancelli form in the interior, by a mechanism si- milar to that which produces it in the other bones; a slight compact layer is formed externally ; but in the middle of this new production, the fibrous

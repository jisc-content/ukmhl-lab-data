Vital Properties. \ / The vital properties also are rather obscure in this system. - In the natural state, animal sensibili- ty is never to be met with ; it is only when in- flammation, or some irritating cause, has exalted their organic sensibility, a sensibility unavoid- ably implied by the functions that are performed ; it is only then, I say, the brain painfully perceives the different irritations that are seated in these organs. This is demonstrated particularly by the heterogeneous bodies that are formed in the arti- culations, which may, or may not, be injured by their presence, accordingly as their position irri- tates the cartilaginous heads, or does not interfere with them. Cartilages do not possess animal or sensible or- ganic contractility, but merely insensible organic contractility or tone, and that even in rather an obscure degree. Sympathies are very obscure, or almost want- ing in this system. I have never heard that by the acute affections of the different organs, the sympathetic phenomenon of sensibility or con- tractility has ever been observed in cartilages. They remain undisturbed amidst the general trouble that affects the other systems in these kinds of diseases. Even in chronic affections they ex- VOL. II. M

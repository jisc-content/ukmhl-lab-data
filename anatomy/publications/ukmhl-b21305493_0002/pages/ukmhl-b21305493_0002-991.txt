SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. 949 but this proceeds from quite a different cause of contraction in other organs. The moisture which the hair naturally contains is evaporated by caloric, and the particles drawn nearer together: hence, when the hair is damped again by a fog, bath, atmospheric air, &c., it uncurls and becomes lank. The greasy substances these organs are imbued with on dressing the hair, provides them with a coating impermeable to water, maintains the head-dress, and prevents its imbibing this fluid. After it is washed the hair will sooner curl, as has often been observed since it was the fashion to wear it short, This at first sight seems a paradox ; it is not so however. In fact, by carefully rubbing the hair, the unctuous fluid it was covered with is removed, or it combines with the soap-suds used for that purpose ; by this means it easily penetrates the hair when the pores are left free, and afterwards by evapo- rating together with the fluids it already contain- ed, an effect that was prevented by the unctuous substance, it is dryer and therefore more disposed to curl. As a further proof that it is the epidermoidal sheath of hair that imbibes the humidity which it loses when after being curled, it droops, is that a detached portion of the epidermis will also curl on being twisted with curling tongs, and then restored again to its natural state if immersed in water.

MUSCULAR SYSTEM 318 functions, is exclusively seated in the muscular system of animal life: it is this that distinguishes it from the organic, and even from any other. It consists in the faculty of moving under cerebral influence, whether this influence be determined by the will or by other causes. Animal contrac- tility then, as well as the sensibility of the same denomination, bears a peculiar character distinct from the two organic contractilities, a character that consists in its action, and not concentrated in the moving organ, but requires also the interfer- ence of the brain and nerves. The brain is the principal from which this property flows, the centra] point to which every sensation is referred. The cerebral nerves are the agents of transmission, in the same manner as they are, though in a re- verse sense, the conveyers of the phenomena of sensation ; hence it follows, that to form a cor- rect idea of this property, it should be studied in the brain, in the nerves, and in the muscle itself. Animal Contractility considered in the Brain. Every thing in the phenomena of animal con- tractility proclaims the influence of the brain. In the natural state, if rather more blood be conveyed to that organ, as during passion; if opium taken in a moderate dose, causes gentle excita- tion ; if wine produce the same effect, the mus-

OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 107 liieut, which on account of the tenuity of the bony plates that form the sockets, is easily per- formed. The teeth have very remarkable sympathies, that do not act upon the solid part, but on the pulp; as this is proportionally much larger in early life, forming the largest portion of the tooth, these sympathies are at that stage both more fre- quent and better characterized ; sometimes the animal properties, at other times, the organic are called into action by these sympathies, The sympathies of animal sensibility are dis- played when the tooth becomes painful from cold, or damp affecting the cutaneous system, and in the painful sensations experienced in the face and the / head from caries. Fauchart quotes an instance of an obstinate headache, that had for a long time resisted all kinds of remedies, and which was instantly cured by the extirpation of a tooth. The sensibility of' the eye, and of the ear, is in- creased in violent tooth-aches, &c.; animal con- tractility is also brought into action by the sympathies of the teeth; nothing is more frequent during dentition than convulsions in the volun- tary muscles. Tissot, mentions a spasm in those of the jaw, which was cured by drawing two teeth, and a convulsion in the muscles of the throat, that terminated in death, the primitive cause of which proceeded from a decayed tooth, &c., See.

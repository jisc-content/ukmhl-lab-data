356 MUSCULAR SYSTEM them distinct from those of the other organs; they are quicker and much more rapid. It should be remarked, however, that every altera- tion in the functions which they display, will enable us to appreciate that vital activity accu- ratelv : in fact, a number of these alterations do not essentially reside, or arise in, the muscular tissue; such, for instance, as the conekisive mo- tions, in which, as we have seen, the muscles act by obeying, but do not possess the principle of action. They indicate in such cases the state of the brain. Thus the arteries only passive, by innumerable varieties of pulsation, indicate the state of the heart, whilst the veins unprovided in their origin with a similar impulsive agent, very seldom present varieties of motion, although their tissue is endowed with as much, or perhaps more, vital activity than the arteries. A proof that the tissue itself in muscles is not so frequently changed as might perhaps at first be supposed, on considering the numerous affec- tions of these organs, is the scarcity of their or- ganic diseases. These even are not so frequently met with as in bones. No indurations, none of those collections, of those changes of texture in a word, so frequently observed in the other organs, have ever been ascertained in these. Amongst the great number of subjects I have dissected, or caused to be dissected, I cannot recollect one single in- stance of any other alteration in the muscles of

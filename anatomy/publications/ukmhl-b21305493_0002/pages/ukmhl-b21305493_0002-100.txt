OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 58 blished by age, in respect to that rapidity or slow progress in the re-union of the parts, is much less than in the system of the bones ; they no longer possess sufficient vitality to inflame and unite, but the skm and the muscles still display that phenomenon in a very striking degree. In an aged subject I have seen the neck of the femur fractured, that had remained for a considerable space of time without uniting, whilst a wound in the face of the same subject was rapidly healed by the first intention. Finally, the following is a very simple experi- ment which I have frequently repeated, and which, like the preceding facts, prove that the animal part of the bone is in the cartilage. It is well known that one of the essential properties of ani- mated forms, is to contract and shrink in burn- ing : now, as long as the bone remains impreg- nated with the earthy salt, it will not admit of this mode of combustion, but if deprived of this substance by an acid, the remaining cartilaginous parenchyma will contract and twist during ignition. The flat bone of the infant in which this parenchyma predominates, displays the same phenomenon ; combustion compels the calcareous portion, which is in small quantity, to follow the impulse it gives to the organ, to bend in a variety of directions; but in the adult, in whom this earthy substance predominates, the bone remains

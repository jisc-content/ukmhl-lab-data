164 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. gans that contribute to form these parts were the same ; but the difference in the muscular, bony, tendinous, cellular, and nervous organs, &c., al- ways requires a considerable length of time, be- fore an equilibrium, as it were, is established, and the divided ends of these organs are ag- glutinated. I have already observed that the division of in inflammation into acute and chronic, is incorrect, because the duration of the inflammatory phenomena in the organs, is completely relative to their mode of vitality. An inflammation of the cellular tissue of the skin, assumes an acute type, when it lasts only a few days; and a chronic one when it exceeds forty or fifty. Now, in a cartilage, this last term may characterize an acute inflammation, whilst a succession of several months is required for a chronic one; instances of which are so frequently met with in diseases of the articu- lations. The natural functions, as well as the morbid affections, partake of this retarded mode of pro- gress in the vital phenomena of cartilages ; their habitual motion of composition and decomposi- tion, their nutrition being slowly performed, the nutritive substances require much time to be com- bined with them. I am convinced that in ani- mals suddenly killed by carbonic acid, the mus- cles, the glands, the membranes, &c., which are almost instantly infected by the contagious prin-

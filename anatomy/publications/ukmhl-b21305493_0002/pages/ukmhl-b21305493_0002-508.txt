466 MUSCULAR SYSTEM much more rapid than in early age ; this rapidity is also in this case perfectly distinct from the power of contractions; very seldom even are these two things united in the highest degree. In general, whenever the power of the heart is augmented, its motion is certainly rather more rapid ; but very frequently there is a reduction of power united to additional quickness, or the power remains the same, the rapidity being con- siderably increased. We have noticed that the voluntary muscles have in general a degree of rapidity they never exceed, and that this rapidity depends upon the constitution. Is not the very same phenomenon observed here? Frequently in two fevers, the symptoms being the same, the degree of in- tensity in every respect perfectly similar, the pulse will be more rapid in one subject than in . the other. This does not always denote a differ- â€¢/ ence in the disease, but in the constitution, that one of the two hearts is more apt to contract much quicker than the other, from the same cause ? Who is not aware that in experiments contractile rapidity varies ad infinitum, under the influence of the same causes ? Each organic muscle is possessed of its peculiar degree of rapidity ; the heart, the stomach, the intestines, the bladder, &c. essentially differ from each other in this respect.

475 OF ORGANIC LIFE* time in forming, are developed long before those intended to form the parieties of that cavity. It is the volume of the intestines, of the stomach, of the bladder, &o. that give to the cavity in which these organs are contained, the remarkable capacity observed at that stage of life. All the organic muscles, nearly uniform at that stage in respect to their proportions of volume, are not so in what regards that of their tissue. The heart is evidently denser and harder than the rest; its texture is strongly characterized. Soft and loose, the fibres of the stomach, intestines, and bladder, perfectly resemble, in this respect, the muscles of animal life ; they contain but a small portion of blood, when compared to that which will subsequently be circulated through them. Their redness is as striking; they are pe- netrated with the same quantity of blood, and are consequently nourished by that fluid. This redness of the heart, perfectly similar to that of the voluntary muscles in the adult, forms a con- trast at that period with their remarkable pale- ness. It presents, besides, the same as in every other part wherein it exists, a deep hue, proceed- ing from the kind of blood that produces it. The reason that so much blood penetrates the heart, is easily conceived, since that organ, very active in its motions, requires considerable force, whilst the others, nearly all in a state of inacti- vity, require much less.

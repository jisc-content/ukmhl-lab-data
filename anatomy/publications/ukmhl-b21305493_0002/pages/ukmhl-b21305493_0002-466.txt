424 MUSCULAR SYSTEM ganic muscles; the greatest number of these muscles receive, as we have seen, two kind of nerves, some are cerebral, the others form the ganglions. The heart, the stomach, the rectum, and the bladder, are evidently supplied with the first of these nerves ; on cutting, or by irritating in any manner whatever, the cardiac filaments of the par vagum, the heart experiences no alteration, its motion is neither accelerated nor diminished. The division of the par vagum is mortal, it is true, but after a few days only, and I much doubt if death arises from its action in such a case. The essential phenomena, as conse- quences of this division, present a considerable obstruction in the lungs, and great difficulty of respiration: circulation appears only to be sub- sequently affected. As the same nerves are extended to the stomach, the same experiment may be tried to ascertain the cerebral influence over this viscus. Nowt the division of one has generally no effect upon this organ, that of both will soon produce a remarka- ble disturbance. But this is quite distinct from the disturbance which follows when a nerve which belongs to a muscle of animal life is di- vided: the power of the muscle is in this case destroyed, whilst the stomach, on the contrary, no longer communicating with the brain by the par vagum, appealtly acquires a momentary in-

GLA NDU L AK SYSTlâ€™M. 707 quantity of blood gorging the large renal vessels are still observed, a quantity not depending upon that habitually contained by the organ, and which, as I have stated, is very considerable. Now the volume of this organ rarely corresponds to these varieties, because it possesses but little extensibility. In respect to the glands situate at the two ex- tremities, such as the testis on one part, the sali- vary glands on the other, the stagnation of blood cannot be perfectly observed, because the reflux is not sufficiently manifest in these parts. In this respect then, we can only judge of their extensi- bility and contractility but by analogy. The swellings in the testis, however, in con- sequence of syphilis, the tumefactions of the pa- rotids, actually prove the existence of these pro- perties in some degree. Are the liver, the kidneys, and other interior glands, liable to these acute tumefactions so frequently observed in the subcu- taneous ones? This is very probable, for physi- cians, perhaps, do not pay sufficient regard to the accessory symptoms which may arise from the pressure of these tumid organs against the adja- cent parts. Besides, this tumefaction and the contraction resulting from it, may occur in the cellular tissue of the gland, and consequently imply less extensibility in the glandular tissue than migt^at first be supposed. zz2 i

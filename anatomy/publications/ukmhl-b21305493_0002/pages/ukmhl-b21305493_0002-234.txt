FIBROUS SYSTEM. 192 hardly discernible ; however, I have repeatedly remarked, that by submitting to desiccation parts of the aponeurosis, of the periosteum, of the dura- mater, &c. perfectly cleared of any other part, when all these fluids had evaporated, and that the organ had borrowed that appearance of parch- ment which is then remarked, an exudation of fat was seen in different parts over its surface. The number of vessels varies in the fibrous sys- tefevery considerable, in several organs, as in the dura-mater, the periosteum, &c.; they are less so in others, as in the aponeuroses, and not at all in some, as in tendons. I have observed that in ge- neral, inflammations and different tumours are most frequent in those which contain the most vessels. The affections of the dura-mater, of the periosteum, when compared with those of ten- dons, are remarkable proofs of it. I have never heard absorbant vessels had ever been traced in / the fibrous system. Notwithstanding all that has been written re- specting the nerves of the periosteum, of the dura- mater, &c. this system does not appear to be pro- vided with these organs.

EPIDE R MOIDAL SYSTEM. 910 is free on one side only ; the other anterior, and detached on both sides. The posterior part of the nail forms nearly a sixth part of its whole extent. Its convex sur- face adheres rather strongly to the epidermis, which, to fix it, is disposed in the following man- ner: after having covered the portion of the finger corresponding to the last joint, it is reflected over the concave border, where the skin ends, and the nail begins to emerge. It commonly surrounds this edge with a kind of small and very distinct thread, in which is a small groove, and which is evidently of the nature of the epidermis, since it admits of being cut without causing pain, and is easily re-produced. After having formed this ridge, which makes a kind of curve, the epi- dermis is again reflected ; insinuates itself between the skin and the nail, and is glued, as it were, to the concave surface, without being confounded together; for it is easily removed by scraping it with the dissecting knife. In this manner the dermis that covers the superior part is actually interposed between two sheets of epidermis. After having thus fixed the nail, and on reaching the posterior edge, the epidermis is continued, even identified with it, which edge, considering its softness and tenu- ity, is rather assimilated to this membranous sheet. Hence it must be inferred, that were it not for the attachment of the epidermis to the

308 MUSCULAR SYSTEM phenomena that evidently result from the con- tractility of tissue. 1st. The two divided ends contract in two op- posite directions, leaving between them a space proportionate to the retraction. This retraction ]s not regulated, as it was conceived, by the de- grees of muscular contraction; if this were the case, it would be sufficient, in cases of a transverse wound, to place the limb in the most relaxed state, in order to bring the divided parts in con- tact ; for frequently, in this case, they remain se- parated, but the retraction frequently exceeds the utmost contraction of the muscle considered in its natural state. 2dly. The antagonist of the divided muscle having no longer any effort to overcome, contracts and withdraws the moveable part, if no other mus- cles, acting in the direction of the former, supply the deficiency. This last phenomenon also takes place to a certain degree when paralysis affects the face. The mouth is then drawn towards the sound side. I have remarked, however, in this respect, that this deviation is never so striking as it would be in the division of a paralysed mus- cle which has retained its contractility of tissue. The remaining contractility, during the absence of motion, maintains in part an equilibrium with that of the muscles of the sound side. Thus the deviation becomes very striking only when the patients attempt to speak, for when the sound

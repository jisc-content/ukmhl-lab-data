554 MUCOUS SYSTEM. rough and uneven body lodged there accidentally, &c. &c. To this power of habit over sensibility of the mucous system must partly be referred the gra- dual decay attendant upon age. Every thing is exciting for the infant, every thing has lost its power with the aged subject. In the one, the remarkable activity of the alimentary, biliary, urinary, salivary surfaces, <fcc. especially contri- bute in producing that rapidity with which the phenomena of digestion and secretion succeed each other; in the latter, this sensibility, blunted by the habit of contact, assumes but slow pro- gress in connecting these phenomena together. Is it not from this very same cause that the re- markable modification in the sensibility of this system proceeds; namely, that in its origins, as in the pituitary membrane, the palate, the oeso- phagus, the glans, the orifice of the rectum, &c. it conveys the sensation of the bodies it is in con- tact with, whilst this sensation is not felt in the organs lined with it, that are very deeply situate, as in the intestines, the excretory ducts, the gall- bladder, &c. ? In the depth of organs this con- tact is uninterruptedly uniform. The bladder is only sensible to the contact of urine ; the gall- bladder to that of bile ; the stomach singly ad- mits of that of nutritive matters, masticated and reduced, however varied they may be, into an

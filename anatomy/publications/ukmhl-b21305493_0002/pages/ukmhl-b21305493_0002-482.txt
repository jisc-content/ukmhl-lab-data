MUSCULAR SYSTEM 440 gative one. The transition from a state of apa- thy to that of excitement is more rapid; but the reverse transition is not less felt when it is abrupt: besides, this manner of viewing sensible organic contractility in exercise is deserving of further experiments. Of Sensible Organic Contractility, considered in respect to the Organs. Considered with respect to the organ in which it is seated, sensible organic contractility presents innumerable varieties, which relate, First, To the difference of the tissue; Secondly, To age ; Thirdly, To sex; Fourthly, To the constitution of the subject. First Variety. â€” Difference of the Muscular Tissue. Animal contractility is everywhere the same in the voluntary muscles, on account of their or- ganization being uniform. The number and the length of the fibres being equal, the phenomena of contraction are everywhere exactly the same : here, on the contrary, the varieties in the tissue must necessarily produce others in the vital pro- perties. Every involuntary muscle is first specially connected with the fluid of its habitual stimulant: the blood only is calculated to continue the

536 MUCOUS SYSTEM. reflux of blood towards the epiploon and spleen, it is much less considerable than has generally been thought. Besides the numerous folds of the mucous membrane of this viscus leaving in this state of vacuity, as has already been observed, nearly the same surface, and consequeutly the same number of vessels as during its plenitude, the blood must circulate in it with nearly the same freedom. There is then no real obstacle existing, except in the tortuous course, and by no means in the shrinking contraction and stran- gulation of these vessels produced by the con- traction of the stomach. Now this obstacle is easily removed, or rather it is no obstacle at all, as T have proved it by my researches upon death. In what regards the other hollow or- gans, it is very difficult to study the circulation in the surrounding parts, during their state of plenitude and of vacuity, because the vessels of the latter are not superficial as in the epiploon, \ or that these organs are not insulated like the spleen. To resolve the question then, the inter- nal membrane of the mucous surface only can be examined : but this surface has undeviatingly appeared to me as red during contraction as in the opposite state. Besides, I only bring this forward as a mere fact, without intending to deduce from it the least consequence reverse to the common opinion. It is possible in fact, that although the quantity

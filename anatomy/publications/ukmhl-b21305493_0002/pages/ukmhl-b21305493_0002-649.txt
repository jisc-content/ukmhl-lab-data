607 SEKOUS SYSTEM. membranes are inflamed, the subjacent lympha- tics are seen distended in the same manner as those with the red globules of the blood, &c. It appears evident thpn : lstly. That the ab- sorbents open in innumerable Orifices over the serous membranes: 2dly. That their roots, a thousand times interwoven together, and with the orifices of the exhalents, especially contribute to form their tissue: 3dly. That the difficulty of distin- guishing the pores of the absorbents and exhalents over the surfaces is not a sufficient reason for de- nying their existence ; this difficulty arising from their excessive tenuity, and the oblique direction in which they open between the sheets of these mem- branes. Thus the obliquity of Warthonâ€™s duct at its insertion, or of the ductus choledocus, renders it very difficult to discover them, although these ducts are much more considerable : 4thly. That from this structure, the serous membranes should be consi dered invariably disposed, as we have seen, in the form of imperforated bags, as large reservoirs in- terposed between the exhalents and absorbents, in which the lymph on passing from the one stagnates for some time before it enters the other, wherein it undoubtedly undergoes some changes which we shall never be able to in- vestigate, because it would be necessary to com- pare the fluids of both these vessels, which is almost impossible, at least in respect to the former; and finally, wherein it is intended for different

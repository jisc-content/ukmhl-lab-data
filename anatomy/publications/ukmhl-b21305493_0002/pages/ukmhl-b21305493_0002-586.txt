MUCOUS SYSTEM. 544 duction of all other humours expelled by the mucous surfaces, does not appear to me calculated to account for the formation of this. Whenever the phenomenon takes place in several parts, and the explanation given is applicable to one only, we should guard against such explanation. It ought to be remarked besides, that in re- spect to pulmonary perspiration, the solution of the mucous fluid by which the bronchia are lubri- cated, in air incessantly inspired and respired, composes a considerable part of that vapour which, imperceptible in the summer, is very re- markable in winter, on account of the condensa- tion of the atmosphere. The mucous juices dissolve the same as all other fluids; for wherever atmos- pheric air is united with heat and moisture, evaporation exists. This evaporation is even a medium nature has selected to rid herself, as I have said, of the mucous juices. If they hap- pen to be superabundant, as in catarrhs, then the quantity of air that acts as their vehicle, not be- ing proportionally increased, other means are re- quired to evacuate them ; expectoration is sub- stituted for the part air cannot remove by dis- solving it. The intestinal juice, especially considered by Haller, but which appears to be much less consi- derable than he first supposed, the oesophagean, and the gastric juices, particularly the latter, which is considered distinct from the mucous

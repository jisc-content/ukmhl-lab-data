OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 93 Progress of Ossification in the Short Bones. These organs generally remain cartilaginous much longer than the others; even at birth, several are frequently in this state, particularly those of the tarsus, and of the carpus. The bodies of the vertebrae ossify much sooner, a nucleus forms in the centre and extends all over the surface. These phenomena are nearly similar to those ascertained in the progress of ossification in the heads of the long bones, with which the short bear so much analogy. Subsequent to birth, the whole of the cartilaginous substance is invaded, as it were, by the calcareous substance, with which it intermixes, and finallv, there remains no other cartilaginous part, except that of the articula- tions. There are bones that unite, such as the occi- pital, the sphenoidal, the characters both of the long and of the short bones; their mode is mixed, and follows that of each, according to the part in which it is examined.

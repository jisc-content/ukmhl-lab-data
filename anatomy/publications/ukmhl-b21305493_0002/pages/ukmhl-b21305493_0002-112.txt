70 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. which I have just alluded, the articulating sur- face is situate at the very end of the bone, and not sideways ; the axis is the same for both, and they form a rectilineal lever instead of an an- gular one. These articulating surfaces, in general, are like the preceding, uniform, destitute of reciprocal prominences and depressions, which would ob- struct and even completely prevent circumduc- tion. In the supporting bone it is a concavity more or less deep; in the moveable bone, it is an analogous convexity. The corresponding sur- faces of the temporal and inferior maxillary bones, those of the metacarpus, and the first phalanges, &c. afford instances of this dispo- sition. This mode of articulation is most favourable for circumduction, which is, as we have seen, al- ways in a reverse sense to the rotation, and which constantly affords the greatest possible fa- cility when the lever is rectilinear, a circum- stance by which rotation is annihilated : how- ever, in many articulations of this kind, circum- duction is evidently more restricted than in the humerus and in the femur ; but this proceeds from the moving powers, which being much more numerous in these two long bones, compensate for the disadvantageous disposition, by the circum- duction of the articulating surfaces. In the articulations we are now considering,

GLANDULAR SYSTEM. TOO appear rather less indebted to the blood in this* respect: they retain a part of their colour in macerating; even the pulp resulting from it, still retains some degree of colour, after being immersed for some months in water frequently renewed. Does the state of the secretions cause any va- riation in the quantity of the blood contained in the glands? Is a greater quantity of this fluid conveyed to the kidneys where more urine flows from this organ, than when it separates less. Or again, the same quantity of blood being conveyed through the arteries, is a less quantity returned through the veins in the former case than in the latter? This is a very interesting subject for ex- periments. Does the blood undergo any alteration in its nature before reaching the glands ? Is this fluid submitted to some peculiar preparation previous to its penetrating each of these organs? Much has been said of this change, indispensable it has been asserted for secretion ; but to produce such a change a cause is necessary, but where is this cause ? Does not the blood circulate through the trunks which resort to the glands, as in other trunks ? Each gland then should be surrounded with an atmosphere acting upon the blood, at some distance from the point of its situation.

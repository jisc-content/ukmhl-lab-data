GLANDULAR SYSTEM. G79 from sight. They generally run in a straight direction, do not anastomose, and instantly open on reaching the surface of the gland. 2dly. Such as are single, are larger, and always in proportion to the volume of their respective gland ; excepting however the hepatic, which is evidently very small when compared with the organ it belongs to. These pass from their respective glands, originat- ing from tubes as large as the preceding; so that, if a single trunk originating from excretory ducts, separate from these, they would, in every respect, resemble the others. They only differ from them in their secondary divisions, which open immediately upon their surfaces, whilst in the others they unite into a common trunk. The pancreas is the only gland in which the course of that common trunk is concealed with- in the same gland. In the testicle only it is seen to twine, where, on this account, it is much longer. In whatever manner they are disposed, the excretory organs pour all their fluid either ex- teriorly, as the urethra and the ureters, the lac- teals, the tubes of the sebaceous glands, &c.; or inwardly from the mucous membranes, as the mucous ducts, the salivary pancreatic, prostatic, and the hepatic ducts. The two surfaces, the i . cutaneous,* and the mucous, are then the only parts wherein the excretory ducts terminate ; the only parts moistened with their fluids. These

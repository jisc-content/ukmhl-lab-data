It is well known, that certain affections of the lungs will provoke the sexual appetite ; that in the natural state, certain parts of the skin being rather quickly excited, that of the nates espe- cially, will rouse the whole genital system into action, &c. &c. We are well acquainted with that remarkable sympathy which lays the breast under the depend- ance of the womb. We are aware that at every re- turn of the periodical discharge, the breasts rather swell; that cancer frequently takes place at the period menstruation ceases; that the voluptuous sensation of coition is sometimes extended up to the breasts, &c. Every physician has remarked those connections of sympathy, which are seem- ingly of a peculiar nature, and depend upon an analogy of functions in the two sympathizing organs. Subsequent to long continued and acute diseases, to fevers especially, the glandular action is fre- quently considerably increased, and copious evacu- ations take place. These form a crisis, and thus ac- cording to the opinion of many, the morbid cause is expelled: this is a phenomenon that ought to be re-examined, and which undoubtedly, in a number of cases, does not, as I shall prove, depend upon the cause ascribed to it.

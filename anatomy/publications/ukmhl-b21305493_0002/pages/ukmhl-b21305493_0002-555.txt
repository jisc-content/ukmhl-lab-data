The micro- scopic experiments of Leiberkuhn, respecting the bubble of the intestinal villi, have been con- tradicted by those of Hunter and Cruikshanks, and particularly by those of Hewson. As to myself, I can affirm that I have never seen any thing similar over the surface of the small intes- tines at the moment chyle was absorbed ; and it appears to me, that what relates to inspection should never vary ; 4thly. It is true that these intestinal villi are every where attended with a vascular net-work, from which they borrow a hue very distinct from the colour of the cutane- ous papillse : but the non-appearance of the cu- taneous net-work proceeds from the pressure of atmospheric air, and particularly from the dry- ness it produces in the small vessels. In fact, only see the foetus the moment it leaves the mo- therâ€™s womb ; its skin is as red as the mucous mem- branes, and if the papillse were rather more pro- minent, it would almost perfectly resemble the internal surface of the intestines. Who, besides, is not perfectly aware that the vascular net- work, investing the cutaneous papillse, is ren- dered very evident by liquid injections, so effec- tually as even to change the hue completely ?

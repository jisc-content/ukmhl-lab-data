518 MUCOUS SYSTEM. over the mucous surface. They are not quite so apparent in the bladder, the womb, gall bladder, vesiculae seminales, <fec.; but their existence is fully proved by the mucus with which their in- ternal surface is lubricated. In fact, since on the one hand this fluid is of an analogous nature over every mucous membrane, and, on the other hand, it is evidently furnished by glands where- ever these organs are apparent, it necessarily fol- lows that it must also proceed from glands where even they are not so conspicuous. The iden- tity of the secreted fluids must imply an iden- tity of the secreting organs. It appears, that wherever these glands are concealed from the sight, nature has, by multiplying their number, compensated for their minuteness ; besides, there are animals, in which they form, by their multi- plicity over the intestines, a kind of additional layer to that mentioned before. In man, this fact is remarkable in the palate, and its appendage the velum palati, in the internal surfaces of the lips, of the cheeks, &c. &c. There is this dis- tinction then between the mucous and serous membranes, that the former are lubricated by se- cretion, the latter by exhalation. The mucous glands vary in size : the soft pa- late, &c. seem to contain the largest: this size is gradually reduced in the greatest number of the mucous surfaces. I have dissected two subjects who died from pulmonary catarrh, in whom those

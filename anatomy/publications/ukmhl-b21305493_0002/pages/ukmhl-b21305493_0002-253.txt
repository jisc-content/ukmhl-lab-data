211 FIBROUS SYSTEM. SECTION III. Accidental Dev elopement of the Fibrous System. We have seen that different productions, belong- ing by their nature to the bony and cartilaginous systems, are sometimes accidentally developed in peculiar parts. Pathological anatomy also discloses to us productions in which the fibrous appearance is very evident. In tumours of the womb, of the fal- lopian tubes, &c. I have had repeated opportuni- ties of ascertaining the fact; instead of the greasy matter so commonly met with in organic affec- tions, one or two fibrous collections heaped toge- ther, very distinct, and of a yellowish appear- ance, are found. I cannot affirm that these ex- crescences essentially belong, in respect to their component parts, to the fibrous system, having never comparatively submitted them to experi- ments with the organs of that system. ARTICLE V. Fibrous Membrane in general. After having considered the fibrous system in a general manner, in respect to its organization, its vitality, its properties, and nutrition, I shall par- ticularly examine it in the essential divisions it offers, and which we have pointed out before. I shall begin with the hbrous membranes. p 2

GLANDULAR SVSTEM 726 know that soon after a meal the kidneys are par- ticularly active. Intermission of the action in the mammae is nearly as substantially proved as that of the organs of animal life. Each mucous gland has its proper time for secretion : it is when the mucous surfaces, to which their excretory ducts resort, come in contact with any substance, either stagnating upon, or merely crossing these organs. We should not only then conceive the glands as constantly separating a fluid from the blood, but as being more active at certain periods, and emit- ting consequently more fluids. This remittent state in the glands seems to pro- ceed from a cause rather analogous to that of sleep, which, in animal life, is the result of the lassitude experienced by jthe sensitive organs, and by those of locomotion, after rather long con- tinued exertion ; the kind of weariness glands admit of, is not generally attended with a painful sensation, as in animal life; its nature seems to be quite different. However, after long suckling^ females feel a kind of drawing in the breast, by which nature warns them it is time to cease. The testes, when the emission of semen has been re- peatedly forced, become the seat of a painful sen- sation, &c.

206 FIBROUS SYSTEM. them. This leads us to a very important and inte- resting general consideration, the correctness of which is also ascertained by the study of the other systems ; namely, that it is the mode of vital pro- perty which predominates in a system, that is specially called into action in sympathies. As that mode of animal sensibility calculated to answer to the agents of distension, is the most predominant, t acts the principal part in sympathies of the fibrous system. ARTICLE IV. Development of the Fibrous System. SECTION I. State of that System in the early Age. In the mucous state of the embryo, the fibrous organs cannot as yet be distinguished. Every tiling is confused. It is only after several other organs are formed, that they begin to be traced. Those in the form of membranes first appear as a transparent canvas; those disposed in bundles appear an homo- geneous body. In general the fibres are not distinct at first; the aponeuroses, the fibrous membranes, the tendons, &c. have not presented to me the slightest outline of them ; every thing at that stage seemed to be uniform in the texture of the fibrous or-

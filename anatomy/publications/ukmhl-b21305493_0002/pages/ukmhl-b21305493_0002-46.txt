GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 4 The cutaneous; 12th. The epidermoid; 13th, and finally, The system of the hair. It may be remarked, that nature, in distribut- ing these systems throughout the different organs, has not restricted herself to method ; she pays no regard to the considerable distinctions existing between their respective functions. Each may appertain at the same time to parts for functions that have not the least analogy with each other. Thus, the fibro-cartilaginous, particularly met with in the organs of locpmotion, consequently in animal life enters the process of respiration W through.the trachea; thus, the mucous system, destined in nearly all the parts for the organs of internal life, belongs also to external life in the con- junctivae, in the fossae nasales, &c. to generation in the vesiculse seminales, in the prostrate gland, &c.; thus does the glandular system moisten al- ternately with fluids, the organs, both of ani- mal and organic life, as those of generation. Thus are the serous surfaces extended over parts very distinct from each other by their functions, over the brain and stomach, for instance, over the articulating cartilages, and the lungs, &c. Let us then consider the simple systems by ab- straction, if I may be allowed the expression ; let us represent them to ourselves in an isolated manner, as materials distinct from each other, although united, two by two, three by three, four

OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 14 vered with aponeuroses, membranes, &c.,are either rough or smooth. Towards the centre, the bone is thinner, and always thicker in the ridges, which are intended either for articulation or insertion. In the first case, this greater thickness secures the solidity of the joints which is effected by wider surfaces, as in the cranium : in the second, it sup- plies the fibres with a multiplied origin, as may be observed in the crista of the os ilium, and in the greatest part of its circumference. The interior of flat bones discloses but few peculiarities; their two external plates leave a space between them filled with eancelli. SECTION III. Of the Short Bones. The short bones are generally situate in such parts, wherein motion and solidity must be united, as in the vertebral column, the tarsus and the metatarsus; always rather small, they are accu- mulated in a tolerable number in their respective regions : this number in the formation of the parts of the skeleton to which they contribute, com- pensates for their smallness. It is also this num- ber that insures to these parts the possession of the two properties we were just now mentioning, and nearly opposed to each other, namely, solidity, be-

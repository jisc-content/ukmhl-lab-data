It appears that in the two ends of the tube, the cellulas or membranes do not open into those of the cancelli, and that the medullary juice of the former has no communication with that of the latter. In fact, the line of demarcation is obvious, for they are not gradually confounded together. The air forced into one side of the medullary cylinder, reaches with the utmost diffi- culty only by lacerating the membranes in the cancelli of the opposite head of the bone : how- ever, notwithstanding these considerations, I con- fess the question is not completely resolved. The transudations in dead bodies prove nothing in this effect, on account of the permeability of our parts subsequent to death. SECTION If. Organization. We are but imperfectly acquainted with the tissue of the medullary membrane, because its extreme tenuity renders it imperceptible ; it is only in ricketty subjects that its morbid increase of thickness has enabled me to follow its course with accuracy. It has the same appearance as the cellular tissue, however its properties, and therefore its nature, are very distinct from those

508 MUCOUS SYSTEM. lieve, that after the brain, this is the soonest af- fected by the action of water. It is reduced to a reddish pulp, very different from that produced by exposure to pure air. When a whole stomach is submitted to maceration, this pulp becomes detached before the submucous tissue and the serous membrane have hardly undergone the slightest alteration. A greenish skin, very diffe- rent from that obtained when the muscular and cellular tissues are boiled, is first extracted from the mucous tissue by the same process. This skum, when mixed with the whole fluid at the com- mencement of ebullition, at first thickens the water and gives it a greenish appearance, subse- quently rises over its surface, where it is found to contain but very few particles of air, frequently even it sinks by its own weight. Its colour is changed to a dark brown by sulphuric acid. Just before the water boils, the mucous tissue twists and shrinks in the same manner as the others, but in a less degree. The sub-mucous tissue over which it is applied, shrinking much more, this of necessity must contract to be of equal length : thus during life, when the fleshy layer of the stomach contracts, its mucous surface not con- tracting proportionally, produces the innumera- ble folds we have mentioned. The sub-mucous tissue shrinking much more than the mucous tis- sue, by the agency of concentrated acid, produces a similar phenomenon. After having been dried

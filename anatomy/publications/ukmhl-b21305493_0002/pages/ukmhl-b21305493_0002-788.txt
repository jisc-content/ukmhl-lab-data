746 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. it, and for the sensation of touch of which it is the seat, and to which its internal surface is a perfect stranger. In this article we shall pass these divers subjects unnoticed, to consider merely the exterior forms of the dermis. Different folds are observed in this surface: 1st. Some arise from the adjacent muscles, which being intimately attached to the dermis, wrinkle it on contracting; such are the wrinkles of the forehead, produced by the subjacent muscles; those of a radiated form, produced by the or- biculares round the eyelids, &c.; those which form on the cheeks when the zygomatic muscles, &c. contract; those with which orbiculares oris surround the mouth, on contracting the lips, &c. All these folds proceed on the one hand, from the skin being unable to contract like the muscles, and on the other hand, that it is requisite it should occupy less space in length at the moment these shorten. They are of a similar nature to those which are formed on the mucous surfaces, par- ticularly to those of the stomach, when the fleshy layer contiguous to them contracts. Thus the direction of these folds is invariably perpendicular to these muscles; they divide by rectangles. Considerable importance is annexed to these mus- cles in the expression of the passions, because they are then more strongly characterized. The width of the human face, in fact, is well accommodated to their development, whilst that of animals is

OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 87 Osseous State. Whenever the whole bone is cartilaginous, and even when some dots of a mucous nature still appear, the exhalation of the calcareous sub- stance begins, and consequently the bony state is manifested. Its progress is as followsâ€”The bone first becomes more dense, subsequently as- sumes a deeper hue, finally a very striking yellow one in its middle ; that is to say, where ossifica- tion is to begin. A red dot is gradually formed, which arises from the vessels conveying red blood, and not from their recent developement, as some anatomists have pretended, or from being forced into these parts, according to their own expres- sion, by the impulse of the heart. These vessels ex- isted before, but circulated only white fluids, after- wards red globules are admitted, and at the same time the adjacent parts are also impregnated with calcareous phosphates. This period is therefore remarkable for two facts, namely, for the circu- lation of blood in the cartilaginous bones, and the exhalation of the phosphate of lime. In general these two phenomena are never separated, when the red hue is observed in a cartilaginous ossifica- tion. This is not only observed in common ossifi- cations, but also in those that are subjected to the common laws, such as the ossification of the car- tilages of the larynx, of the ribs, &c. Whenever

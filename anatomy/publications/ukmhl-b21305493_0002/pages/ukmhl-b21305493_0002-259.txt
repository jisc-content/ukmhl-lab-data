FIBROUS SYSTEM. 217 formed by the falx and the tentorium cerebelli; but except in the sinus, it is difficult, nay even impossible, to find in it two distinct lamellee. These membranes possess more vessels than all the other divisions of the fibrous system ; they have numerous perforations for the passage of these vessels, the greatest number of which only cross them and proceed to the organs they cover. These perforations are of larger dimensions than the vessels they give passage to, form another character of the fibrous membranes, distinct from the serous that constantly fold, and never open to admit the vascular system into their respective organs. The particular description of the membranes we are examining, will be added to that of the organs they inclose. I must, however, except the periosteum, the description of which belongs to these generalities, either because clothing the whole system of the bones it cannot be consi- dered in an isolated manner, or because, as I have stated, it forms the centre from which radiate, and to which resort all the organs of the fibrous system, so that its functions are more nearly allied to this system than to that of the bones. • t " * » - •' < I i • / 1 • . - - • i * SECTION III.

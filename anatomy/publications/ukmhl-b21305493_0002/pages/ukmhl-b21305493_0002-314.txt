272 MUSCULAR SYSTEM. SECTION II. Forms of the Wide Muscles. The wide muscles are generally situate in the parieties of cavities in the animal economy; es- pecially those of the chest and of the abdomen. These parieties are partly formed by them ; they protect the internal organs, and at the same time, by their motions, they facilitate their functions. They are not very thick ; the greatest part of them representing muscular membranes,sometimes disposed by layers, as in the abdomen ; at other i times applied over the long muscles, as in the back ; in the first instance they are more extended as they are examined more superficially. When a wide muscle arises from and termi- nates in one of the great cavities, it preserves in all parts nearly the same width, because there are wide surfaces for insertion ; but if from a ca- vity it extends to a long bone, to an apophysis of a short extent, the fibres concentrate by degrees; it grows narrower and thicker, and terminates in an angle, succeeded by a tendon, which contracts into a very narrow compass the fibres largely disseminated on the sides of the cavity. The great dorsal and pectoral muscles are in- stances of this disposition; which is also met with in the pyriformis, the gluteus medius, mini- mus, &c. ; the wide muscles of the pectoral cavity

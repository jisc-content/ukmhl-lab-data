928 SYSTEM OF THE 11AIK. ever influenced by the former? Never; it may be explained as follows : Every individual is pos- sessed of his own peculiar mode of organization and constitution. From this mode the temper results ; but to each mode is attached, on the one part, such and such a species of hair; on the other, the predominance of such and such internal vis- cera, which, though less striking, is still real. This predominance evidently establishes a particular tendency to certain passions, which form the es- sential attributes of the temper: then the colour of the hair and this are two different results pro- ceeding from the very same cause; namely, from the constitution ; but the one is never influenced by the other, &c. The hairs, on emerging from the cutaneous pores, assume such a direction, that those of the anterior part of the cranium almost invariably pass obliquely forwards, and tend to drop over the forehead; those of the middle, and to some extent, of the posterior part, follow a perpendicular direction; and, finally, those of the remainder, of the posterior and inferior part, cross obliquely, so as to produce a natural fall along the posterior part of the neck. The same remark applies to the side of the head in which, as much from direc- tion as from its weight, they fall over the ear and cover that organ.

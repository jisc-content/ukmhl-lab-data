197 FIBROUS SYSTEM. to the evacuation of the fluid of dropsical articula- tions ; the abdominal aponeurosis, after the first, even the second delivery ; the periosteum subse- quent to the re-solution of exostoses, &c.; all gra- dually contract, and re-assume their primitive forms. SECTION HI. Vital Properties. Animal contractility, and sensible organic con- tractility, are completely wanting in the fibrous system ; like every other organ, it is possessed of organic sensibility, and insensible organic con- tractility. In the natural state, it is also endowed with animal sensibility ; but this property is displayed in a peculiar mode, no other system in the econo- my, I believe, affords an instance of, and which has not yet been properly explained. The common agents that bring it into action, such as the divers mechanical and chemical agents, &c., would be ineffectual here, unless the organ be in a state of inflammation. The tendons, the aponeuroses, the fibrous membranes, the ligaments, &c., laid bare in operations, in experiments on living ani- mals, and variously excited, give no kind of pain. All that has been written respecting the sensibility of the periosteum, of the dura-mater, &c., taken in this sense, is evidently contradicted

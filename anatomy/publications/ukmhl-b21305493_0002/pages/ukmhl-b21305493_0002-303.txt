2G1 F1BR0-CAR TILAGINOUS SYSTEM. SECTION II. Properties of the Tissue. Extensibility is frequently excited in the Ebro-cartilaginous tissue. I have witnessed a polypus that had so far dilated the anterior open- ings, and consequently the fibro-cartilages of the nostrils, that their diameter was at least trebled. The auditory canal, from a similar cause, fre- quently displays a similar distension. In the dif- ferent distortions to which the spine is liable, that portion of the fibro-cartilages corresponding to the convex part of the curves, is very evidently lengthened, whilst that part opposed to it is de- pressed, &c. This extensibility besides, is sub- mitted, in numerous cases, to the very same law that governs it in the fibrous system ; that is to say, it cannot be brought to act, but in a slow and insensible manner. % The contractility of the tissue is obvious, when m the cases I have just been mentioning, the cause of distension has ceased. Thus subsequent to the extraction of the before mentioned poly- pus, the nostril was gradually restored to its na- tural state. In a dog I have removed a tendon from its sheath, by parting it at one end, and drawing it by the other, so as to leave the con- taining sheath entire and uninjured : this sheath

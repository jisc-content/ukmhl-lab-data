SEROUS SYSTEM* 617 the serous system. These are also the properties almost exclusively brought into play in sympathies^ so that whenever either idiopathically or sympa- thetically diseased, the serous membranes always present a series of phenomena which all suppose* either an increased internal motion, or a loss of energy in the capillary vessels, exhalents, ab- sorbents, and in the tissue proper to these mem- branes ; whilst in the muscular systems of animal and organic life, &c. these predominating affec- tions, manifested by convulsions and paralysis in the one, by irregular motions of irritability in the other, do not suppose such interior alteration in the tissue of the ' diseased organ. This explains why these two last systems, though frequently affected during life, hardly disclose any changes on dissection, whilst the serous system opens to* the physician a remarkably extensive field for pa- thological anatomy. The serous surfaces are very susceptible of being influenced by the affections of the other organs this is particularly obvious in the organic diseases of the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, stomach, uterus,, &c., organs which, without any known connection of functions with the serous surfaces, influence however to such a degree, that all their morbific injuries of organization are attended in their last periods with different serous collections in the

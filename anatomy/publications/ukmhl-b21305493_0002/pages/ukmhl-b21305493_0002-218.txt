FIBIIOUS SYSTKM. 170 tribute, to the composition of all, the forms which they assume vary in an astonishing degree ; it is this variety of forms, in common with that of their situations, and of their functions, that has caused them to be differently denominated and designated by the names of tendons, aponeuroses, ligaments, &c. for here there is no general deno- mination for the whole system, a word for in- stance, that will answer to those of muscle, nerve, &c. which in the muscular and nervous system, See. convey the idea of the organization, whatever it may be. This word I shall not form, as I shall be easily understood without it: All the fibrous forms may be referred to two general ones; the one is disposed like the mem- branous, the other in bundles. In the former these organs are wide and thin ; they are thicker in the latter. Thus the muscles, the nerves, even the very bones, alternately present this disposition in their conformation; as is seen in the retina, when compared with the nerves formed of fila- ments ; in the muscular coat of the stomach, of the intestines, on being compared with the muscles of locomotion, in the bones of the skull, compared with those of the limbs.

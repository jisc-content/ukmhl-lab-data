470 MUSCULAR SYSTEM SECTION V. Phenomena of the Relaxation of the Organic Muscles. During the relaxation of organic muscles, the phenomena are generally the reverse of the pre- ceding. It is therefore useless to state them : but here is a question to be examined, namely to know what is the nature of that state which succeeds contraction and alternates with it. In the muscles of animal life, when contraction ceases, it is not in general the muscle itself that returns to its preceding state of extension. This is effected by its antagonist: for instance, when the biceps have contracted to bend the fore-arm, and its contraction has ceased, it becomes passive; the triceps then coming in motion, extend it and cause it to return to its natural position, by first acting - upon the bones which communicate the motion to this muscle. Every muscular power of animal life finds, then, in that opposed to it, a cause for returning to the state it had departed from in contracting. It is not the same thing with respect to organic life ; its muscles, which are hollow, have no antagonists. We have, in fact, to a cer- tain degree, considered as such the substances contained within their cavities, and which oppose the effect of contraction ; but most generally not

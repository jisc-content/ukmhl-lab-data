SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 641 the periosteum, but is reflected over the cartilages. Bv taking it where it reflects, it may be removed to some extent, and thus we may be convinced that it presents an external organization very different from that which the first idea of an arti- culating capsule presents to the mind. This disposition is easily perceived on the slightest dissection in the knee, under the crural tendon andtheinferiorligamentof the patella; inthe elbow under the tendon of the triceps, in the phalanges under those of the extensor, &c. In every articu- lation the organization is also similar, as may be seen in descriptive anatomy; so that it may be affirmed, that a small number only of articulations are possessed of fibrous capsules, that nearly all have nothing more than synovial bags which are formed and reflected over the bony surfaces, without being inserted round them, as all others have stated. I have established this remarkable difference by numberless dissections. Several anatomists were on the way to discovery when they observed,that various capsules appeared to be completely formed of cellular tissue. It was in fact the texture of the synovial membrane, essentially differing in this from the fibrous cap- sules. Let the term capsule be applied if they please to every articulation ; but different ideas must necessarily be attached to it. Let us only compare, for instance, the fibrous capsule of the femur, with the synovial capsule of the knee, and VOL. IT. T T

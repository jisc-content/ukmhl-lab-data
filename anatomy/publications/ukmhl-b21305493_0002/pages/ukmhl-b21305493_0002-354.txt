MUSCULAR SYSTEM 312 The rapidity of contractions, arising from the contractility of the tissue, is not like those pro- duced by animal contractility, or by sensible organic contractility, which are always more or less striking, accordingly as the nervous influence or the stimulant has acted more or less power- fully. Every motion depending upon the con- tractility of the tissue is slow, uniform, and re- gular in its progress; it decreases only when the muscular tissue is weakened, and increases with the power of the latter: from whence it follows, that these varieties in rapidity can only be ob- served in two different individuals, or in the same individual, but at different times, and not as in the exercise of the vital powers, from one moment to the other. This is an important and remark- able distinction between these two species of pro- perties. Death weakens the contractility of the tissue, but does not completely annihilate it: a muscle being divided, retracts long after life has forsaken it. Putrefaction only can destroy this property, and this is also the case with respect to extensi- bility, I have observed, however, that as long as the muscles retain their natural heat, they pos- sess greater power of retraction, than when they have become cold from death. Haller placed on the same line, and deduced from the same principles, the phenomena result- ing from the contractility of the tissue, which,

I OF ORGANIC LIFE. 461 matism, when the pains around the articulations have subsided, there are sometimes violent cholics, even spasmodic vomitings, indicating probably some acute affection of the gastric and intestinal fibres; but these affections can never be traced ; the muscular tissue is never seen tinged of the bright red colour of the mucous, cutaneous, or se- rous organs, when inflamedâ€”at least, I have never observed it. Physicians have not paid sufficient attention to the varieties of inflammation in the different sys- tems ; but, above all, they have not sufficiently observed that this difference perfectly coincides with that of tone, or insensible organic contrac- tility ; that wherever this vital power is the most striking, there is a greater tendency to inflamma- tion, because it presides over their production ; because these affections imply its increase, in the same manner as convulsions imply an increase of animal contractility ; as vomiting, palpitations of the heart, suppose a similar state of the organic contractility,'&c. I cannot repeat too often, that the diseases most common to each system bring into play, increase, or reduce the vital powers predominant in that system. Here is a new pa- thological observation which may prove fruitful in its results.

OF ORGANIC LIFE. 417 The substances contained within the hollow muscles of organic life should be considered as their real antagonists, for they are not opposed by muscles acting in a reverse direction. As long as they are distended by these substances their contractility is counteracted, but as soon as they are emptied it comes into play. It is not upon this property, however, that the mechanism of the ex- pulsion of the matter from these organs, such as food from the stomach and the intestines, urine from the bladder, blood from the heart, &c. re- volves; organic contractility presides over ib These two properties are easily distinguished dur- ing action, for the one causes a slow and gradual contraction without any alternate relaxation ; the other quick, abrupt, consisting in a continuation of contractions and relaxations, constitutes the systole and diastole, &c. After organic contrac- tility has evacuated the hollow muscles, they are again contracted by the contractility of the tissue. In deaths caused by hemorrhage from a large artery, the right side of the heart, and even the left, expel all the blood they contained ; being left empty, they contract forcibly, and the organ remains very small. On the contrary, it is very large when distended by the considerable quantity of blood left in its ca- vities, as in cases of asphyxia for instance. Such are the two extremes, between which there are, as I have before stated, a multiplicity of intermediate vol. u. E E

Finally. The thinnest and most delicate of these divisions, is that which lines the sinuses of the face and the interior of the ear, the tunica arachnoides is often much coarser. I speak of the mucous tissue of the internal ear, notwithstanding that every anatomist has given it the name of periosteum. In fact ; 1st. This tissue is evidently seen continued with the pi- tuitary membrane, through the prolongation of the eustachian tube; 2dly. It is habitually found moistened with a mucous fluid outwardly ex- pelled through this canal, a character inapplicable to the periosteum, which, like every other fibrous membrane, adheres constantly at both surfaces; 3dly. No fibre can be traced in it ; 4thly. Its fungous appearance, although whitish and loose, the facility with which it is lacerated at the slightest attempt, are certainly properties of the mucous membranes. Every thing then contri-

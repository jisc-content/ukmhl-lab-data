574 MUCOUS SYSTEM. the other cellular and mucous. In this experi- ment all the valvulae conniventes are destroyed, and in the canal artificially drawn out, the small intestines are as smooth internally as the large. When this canal is boiled much more scum arises i from it than from that of the adult. This scum is whitish, but never green. The shrinking which takes place a short time previous to ebullition reduces proportionally much more the length of the canal, which appears very strong in conse- quence. At birth, respiration and digestion suddenly be- ginning, and the secretions increasing, the mucous system assumes a remarkable degree of activity. It is on a sudden powerfully excited by the mul- tiplicity of new substances with which it is in con- tact. It is owing to this system, and to the cutaneous, that forms foreign to our body spon- taneously stimulate it, and so much more effec- tually, as the excitement is quite new to the twofold surface by which it is received. Then the mucous system receives from the approach of the red blood additional degrees of energy and sensibility, which make it the fitter to receive impressions. Thus the mucous juices, so far stagnant over their respective surfaces without causing inconvenience, become irritating in con- sequence of the increase, and force the subjacent muscles to contract. The urine then becomes to the bladder a cause of contraction. Soon after

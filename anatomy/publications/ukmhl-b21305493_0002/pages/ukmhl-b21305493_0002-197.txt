155 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. boiled; this is one of the most essential advan- tages derived from boiling. In several experi- ments upon digestion, I have found in the sto- mach of dogs parts of cartilages completely un- affected, whilst the fleshy parts were already re- duced into a pulp. In particular cases the cartilaginous tissue is astonishingly altered; in the diseases of the arti- culation of the hip, it assumes quite a different aspect 5 the cotyloid cavity is filled with a soft substance, larded, as it were, disclosing very dis- tinct vessels, and sometimes very striking fibres, exceeding in size twice, nay, four times their natural state. I have observed, that in this case, those fibres do not become yellow, and are not reduced to fu- sion by ebullition, consequently that they are no longer cartilaginous. In the same diseases I have found the cartila- ginous tissue over the femur and the os ilium, not only ossified, but even converted into a sub- stance similar in every respect to ivory. I pos- sess two of these productions. When the cartilages undergo ossification, a substance analogous to cancelli is formed in the middle, where the decussating fibres leave be- tween them very distinct spaces, in which a kind of medullary juice even is deposited. This obser- vation is particularly applicable to those of the ca- vities of the larynx, of the chest, &c.

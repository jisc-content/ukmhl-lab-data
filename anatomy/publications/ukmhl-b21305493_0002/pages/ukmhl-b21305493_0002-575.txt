MUCOUS SYSTEM. 533 msM by which it was characterized, and then ittn!ยง- sumes the appearance of the skin, as Sabatier has judiciously observed on treating of prolapsus of the womb and of the vagina, which from this cir- cumstance have deceived, and led us to believe the individual an hermaphrodite. The history of the vascular system of the mu- cous membranes, presents a very important question; namely, if according to different cir-v cumstances this system admits of more or less blood. As the organs which are internally lined with these kind of membranes, are nearly all lia- ble to contraction and distention, as is seen in the stomach, intestines, bladder, &c., it has been supposed, that on dilating, the vessels receive more blood, and that on contracting on the contrary, folded and collapsed as it were, they admit but of a small quantity of this fluid, which on such occasions is thrown upon the ad- joining organs. Chaussier has applied these prin- ciples to the stomach, the circulation of which he has considered, as being alternately reversed to that of the epiploon, which received during the vacuity of that viscus, the blood it rejected by being contracted. Since the time of Lieutand, a similar use has also been attributed to the spleen. What follows in this respect, is the result of my observations on animals opened during absti- nence, and at the different periods of digestion.

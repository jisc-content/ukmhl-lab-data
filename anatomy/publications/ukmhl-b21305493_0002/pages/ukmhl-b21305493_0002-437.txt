395 OF ANIMAL LIFE. SECTION IV. State of the Muscular System in old Age. In old age the tissue of the muscles undergoes astonishing changes, it grows resistant and tough, and the tooth tears it with difficulty. This excess of density checks its contractions, which can no longer be performed with rapidity, for the-action of the brain upon the muscles is impaired ; motion cannot be continued so long, it is sooner followed by weariness. It should be observed, the density of the muscles must not be confounded with their cohesion. It proceeds from the integral sub- stances of the muscle: cohesion on the contrary, appears to be connected with the vital influence, the effect of which survives death. If the mus- cles of a robust and powerful adult be dissected, the fleshy mass will be found firm, it preserves its station by its own power, although separated by the knife from all the surrounding tissue. In the body of one who has sunk under a chronic disease on the contrary, in a dropsical or con- sumptive subject, &c. for instance, the muscles are slack, and afford no support; the connections are lost the instant the surrounding tissue is re- moved ; inasmuch as the former are proper sub- jects for the dissection of muscles, so much are these unfit for it. In aged subjects the muscular

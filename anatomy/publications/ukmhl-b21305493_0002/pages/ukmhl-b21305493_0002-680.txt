038 SYNOVfAL SYSTEM. those whitish flakes so commonly observed where serum is accumulated. I know of no instance of an effusion of milky serum in articulations. One of its most frequent alterations, is, I believe, when this fluid assumes the consistence of a reddish jelly, somewhat similar (if I may be allowed the simile)ito currant jelly. Now this alteration has positively nothing to do with the serous fluids. These essential distinctions observed in the al- terations of the synovia and serum, evidently imply a difference in the nature of their compo- nent principles in the natural state. The viscidity of the one, and the greater fluidity of the other, are additional proofs of this, as Fourcroy has ob- served. This diversity in nature appears espe- cially to depend upon a particular substance that enters into the composition of the synovia, and is met with in hardly any other animal fluid. Marguerron, who has studied it, speaks of it as a particular kind of albumine, highly deserving of further research. I shall not enter upon a detailed analysis of synovia, this lays within the department of ani- mal chemistry. section nr. Of the Synovial Membranes. We have seen that the folding of the serous membranes that line the large cavities form a kind of unperforated sacs, embracing both the

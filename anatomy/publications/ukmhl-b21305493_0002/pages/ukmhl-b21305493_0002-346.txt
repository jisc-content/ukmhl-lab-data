304 MUSCULAR SYSTEM daringâ€™ pregnancy, or dropsy, or in various tumours of the abdomen, and the superficial and wide muscles of the hack, in certain cases of swellings situate beneath, display these phenomena of dis- tention in the most obvious light. The muscles of the limbs are not so liable to them, because the causes that produce tumours are not so numerous, and the aponeuroses would not so readily admit of such phenomena. Contractility o f the Tissue. In muscles, this contractility is carried to its utmost extent. These organs have a permanent tendency to contraction, particularly when by lengthening they have exceeded their natural dimensions. This tendency is independent of the action of the nerves, as well as the irritable pro- perty of the muscular tissue. It may be influenced by vitality, but is not especially connected with it, as it depends upon the structure of the muscles. The remarkable phenomenon of the antagonist muscles results from it. Such is this phenome- non.

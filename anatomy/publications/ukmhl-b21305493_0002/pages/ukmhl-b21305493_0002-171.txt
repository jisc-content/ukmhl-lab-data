129 MEDULLARY SYSTEM. SECTION in. t Properties. This vascular network possesses only that degree of organic sensibility, and insensible organic con- tractility, indispensable to its functions ; and this is what especially distinguishes it from the medullary system of the middle of the long bones, in which animal sensibility is, as we shall see, strongly cha- racterized. If the interior of a short or of a flat bone, &c. or the ends of a long one, be irritated in a living animal, no signs whatever of animal sensibility are expressed. The sawing of the bone with the trepan, that of the condyles of the femur, or of the head of the humerus, are not attended with pain. The injuries of this system, when very consi- derable, may produce necrosis, and the production of a new bony substance supplied by the perios- teum ; but if a small division only be concerned, this phenomenon is not produced. I have re- peatedly pierced with a gimlet, in a transverse direction, the end of a long bone in an animal, and subsequently passed a red-hot iron through the aperture: the animal invariably recovered without the slightest symptom of necrosis, only the articulation remained obstructed, much im- vol.ii.

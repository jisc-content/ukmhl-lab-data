15 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. cause the force of the external mechanical shocks are expended in the wide surface by which they are connected, and mobility, because, from their partial motions, there results a very extensive general one. In the external conformation of these bones, there is nothing constant nor uniform; this is modified according to the general plan of the whole of which they form integral parts: thus, the different uses of the carpus, metacarpus of the spine, determine divers forms in their respective bones. The external surfaces of these bones dis- play a number of cavities and projections indis- pensable to their numerous articulations to the in- sertion of the ligamentous bands that connect them together, and to the muscles by which they are moved. In the interior of these bones nothing particu- lar is observed, except a quantity of cancelli of which they are nearly totally composed, and which makes them frequently liable to caries. Let us not suppose, however, that nature has restricted herself to any regularity in dividing these organs, in the long, the flat, and the short bones. Here, as every where else, she baffles our methodical descriptions, and shows us these or- gans, sometimes uniting the character of the long with that of the short bones, at other times the properties of the latter with those of the flat bones. The basillary apophysis and the upper

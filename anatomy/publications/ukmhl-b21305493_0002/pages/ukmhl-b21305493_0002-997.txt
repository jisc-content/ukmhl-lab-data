At an uncertain period after the hair has be- come white it falls off; then the small bag which contained the root is obliterated by degrees, and finally disappears. I have examined several bald heads minutely: the skin of the cranium was remarkably smooth in the internal surface; al- though it had been cleared of the cellular tissue, not one of the numerous prolongations formed by the ducts can possibly be traced after the hair they contained has been torn off.

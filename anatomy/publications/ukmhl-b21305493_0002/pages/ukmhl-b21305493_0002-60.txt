OSSEOUS SYSTEM. ] 8 The , eminences are in general proportionate with the muscles to which they give origin : for instance, in three different muscles nearly equal in size, one of which is implanted by insulated fibres, the other by a tendon, the last by an apo- neurosis, it is remarked, that the sum total of asperities for insertions in the first, the insulated apophysis of the second, and the projecting line of the third, are nearly equal to each other in re- spect to the quantity of bony substance of which they are composed ; so that, admitting the apo- physis to be disseminated in asperities, or ex- tended in a line, or again, these asperities to be ac- cumulated in a mass, or that the line is concentrated to form the apophysis, the quantity of bony sub- stance would be found nearly the same. All the advantages derived from the eminences in respect to the insertion of muscles which they remove from the centre of the bone, by lessening the pa- rallelism with the axis, and consequently promot- ing the motions in an evident manner, are easily conceived. Â» Do they proceed from the contractions of the muscles ? This opinion, borrowed from the laws on the formation of soft and inorganic forms, does not accord with the known phenomena of vitality, with the existence of eminences for in- sertions that are not muscular, and which fre- quently project much more than these, with the disproportion existing between the elongation of

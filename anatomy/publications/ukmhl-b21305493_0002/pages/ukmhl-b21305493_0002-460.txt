418 MUSCULAR SYSTEM links, the contractility of the tissue being in this system proportionate with the number of fleshy fibres. Thus, ceteris paribus, the rectum being empty, contracts with more power than the large intestines; the contraction of the ventricles is much greater to that of the auricles than of the oesophagus, exceeds the contraction of the duo- denum, &c. &c. SECTION II. Vital Properties. These are nearly in a reverse order to those of the preceding system. Properties of Animal Life.â€”Sensibility. Animal sensibility is rather obscure in the or- ganic muscles. The observation made by Harvey, of a caries of the sternum which had left the heart bare, is well known ; that organ was irritated al" most without the patient being conscious of it, and merely contracted under the irritation. If we remove the peritoneum from behind the bladder of a living dog, and the subjacent muscular layer be irritated, the animal will scarcely give any signs of pain. It would be difficult to try these experiments on the intestines and the stomach; their muscular layer is so very thin, it would be

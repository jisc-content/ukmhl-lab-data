179 FIBROUS SYSTEM. FIBROUS ORGANS. 1st. The tendons are found at the origin, at the insertion, and in the middle of muscles; they are either single in the form of extended strings, as in the peronei, the tibials, and in almost every muscle ; or compound, as in the rectus femors, the flexors, &c. 2d. The ligaments secure the cartilaginous or bony articulations round which they are placed ; they are formed of regular fasciculi, as the lateral ligaments of the elbow, of the knee, of the jaw, &c. or of irregular fasciculi, as those of the pelvis, A single glance at the following table, will be sufficient to represent the classification I have just pointed out for the fibrous organs. &c SECTION III Table of the Fibrous System 'Fibrous membranes.

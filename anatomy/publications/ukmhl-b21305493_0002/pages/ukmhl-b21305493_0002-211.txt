CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 169 it is a forerunner of the approach of the blood. This disposition is completely unconnected with the cartilage which covers the bone in the adult. The absence of ossification of the cartilages of moveable articulations, is commonly attributed to the articulating motions ; but I think it pro- ceeds solely from the laws relating to the nutri- tion of bones. Here nature has placed the limits for the exhalation of the calcareous phosphate, as she has also restricted to the origin of a tendon, the exhalation of the fibrine, for the correspond- ing muscle; it is because the mode of organic sensibility changes, and that the vessels of the cartilage are no further connected with the red part of the blood, nor with the earthy substance. In fact, in admitting as real the preceding hy- pothesis, where would be the necessity of carti- lages in the immoveable articulations ? Why should they exist ? Why should motion, that elsewhere promotes exhalation and secretion, in this case prevent the former ? Why should unna- tural ossification take place in the most move- able parts, of which we find a striking instance in arteries ? Why, again, in peculiar cases of anchy- losis, in which the articulating surfaces unite to- gether, and motion is lost, are the cartilages not destroyed ? The cartilages intended for cavities possess a mode of origin, of developement, and of nutri- tion, perfectly similar to that of the articulating

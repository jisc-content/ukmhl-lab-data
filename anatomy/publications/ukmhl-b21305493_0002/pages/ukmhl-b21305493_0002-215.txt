173 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. analogous to those of the moveable articulations that are enveloped by the periosteum, in the same manner as these are covered by the synovial mem- brane. Can the spleen thus outwardly become cartilaginous, admit of changes in its volume? Of this I know nothing. The moveable, and frequently the free cartilaginous productions in the articulations, are sufficiently known. Do they proceed from the ossification of a part of the sy- novial membrane ? I presume this is the case ; for they have frequently been seen adhering to the cartilage by membranous extensions. Last year I observed in a corpse, that a portion of the synovial membrane proceeding from the mass of adipose matter, situate behind the patella, and passing to the notch that separates the condyles of the femur, was almost completely cartilaginous ; if during life it had been loosened by the effect of the mo- tions, it would have formed one of those move- able and free cartilages. Besides, as I have only this individual fact to produce on this head, I can present nothing else but conjectures ; and still more so, because the synovial and the serous mem- branes, as is perfectly shown, are of a similar na- ture, and the latter very seldom become cartila- ginous. These kinds of productions also, exactly follow the common course of ossification ;â€”cartilaginous at first, and unprovided with any blood-vessel, they soon disclose, if not recently formed, a

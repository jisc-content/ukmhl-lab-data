serous system. 614 ]s inflamed, the patient undergoes inexpressible pain. This explains why accumulation of air is so very painful; why too large a quantity of be- verage should be avoided. The acute pain at- tendant upon strong inspiration in pleurisy is suf- ficiently known ; it proceeds from the lungs di- lating the pleura, and tending to force itself be- tween the folds attending the large pulmonary vessels, &c. Contractility. It corresponds to the extensibility; conse- quently is less than would appear at first; for in- stance, when the peritoneum contracts, it again forms different folds, it re-assumes the state it had- forsaken by undergoing locomotion, &c. It can- not be denied, however, that these two properties are most obvious in considerable dilatations; in hydrocele, for instance, in proportion as the water flows, the tunica vaginalis visibly contracts. The same phenomenon is observed when, under similar circumstances, the peritoneum is punctured. At the moment emphysema is produced, the pleura does not undergo this phenomenon in so striking a degree, not from a deficiency of contractility, but because it adheres to the sides which do not contract, and if the fluid has been long effused, the lungs are so compressed that they can be no longer dilated by air, so that there is a vacancy left between the costal and pulmonary portions,

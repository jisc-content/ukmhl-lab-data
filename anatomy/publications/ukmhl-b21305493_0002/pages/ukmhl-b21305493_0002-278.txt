FIBROUS SYSTEM. ment are gradually lost in the cellular tissue, without the slightest possibility of the line being drawn. This disposition is almost peculiar to the fibrous system ; at least I know of none which thus interweaves and loses its fibres in the cel- lular tissue ; it is so much the more remarkable, that the nature of each tissue is essentially dif- ferent : they do not give the same products, nor follow the same organic arrangement. The fibres of a general aponeurosis are hardly ever interwoven in more than two or three direc- tions : this disposition of the fibres is generally visible to the naked eye; but 1 have often re- marked, that by immersing an aponeurosis in boil- ing water, and leaving it there for some time, they become still more striking. This observation is also applicable to the whole fibrous system, to these organs particularly, the texture of which being little apparent, seems homogeneous at first glance. In this manner also the fibres of the dura- mater are rendered very distinct. Functions. The habitual ^compression of the aponeuroses over the mcmbiTmtrr, besides the uses already pointed out, has also the effect of forwarding the circulation of the white and red fluids. Thus va- rices, very seldom met with in the deep seated veins that attend the arteries, are excessively nu-

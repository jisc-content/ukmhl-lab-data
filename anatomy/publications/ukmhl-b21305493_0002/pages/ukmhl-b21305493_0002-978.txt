SYSTEM OF THE HAIR* 936 ARTICLE II. Organization of the Hair. However much the hair may vary in respect to form, length, and position of every description, its organization is the same in all, and we will now proceed to examine it in a general light. Chirai, Malpighy, and all anatomists since their time, have described the structure of hair with a tolerable degree of accuracy in some respects, and very imperfectly in others. The following observations are the result of the most scrupulous dissection. SECTION i. Origin of the Hair. Hair generally arises amidst the sub-cutaneous fat, or in the cellular tissue of the parts that are deprived of this fluid. Every individual hair is inclosed at its origin in a kind of small mem- braneous canal, with the nature of which I am totally unacquainted, and through the transparent parietes of which the hair is evidently seen, on being carefully cleared of the surrounding parts. This small cylindrical canal is continued with the hair as far as the cor- responding pores of the skin; it insinuates itself through that pore, and extends as far as the epi- dermis, where it stops, identifying itself with the

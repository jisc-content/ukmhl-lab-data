SEKOUS SYS L EM. 581 count of the connexion of functions existing be- tween these two surfaces taken together, a con- nexion that especially relates to the exhalation of albuminous fluids produced by the one, and the secretion of mucous fluids, that exists in the other. However, on examining individually the extent of each serous membrane, from the perito- neum, whose surface is the most extensive, down to the tunica vaginalis, which is the least, consi- derable varieties will be observed. The serous surfaces, considered as a whole, com- pared with the cutaneous surface, also evidently exceed it in width ; so that, in this respect, the quantity of albuminous fluids constantly exhaled within, appears much more considerable than that of the humour habitually expelled by the insen- sible perspiration : in this respect I say, because various circumstances, by increasing the action of the skin, may render these fluids more equal; one of which is returned by absorption to the circu- lation, the other being merely excrementitious. I even doubt if the pulmonary and cutaneous ex- halations united together, are not less than those of the serous surfaces. Every serous membrane presents an imper- forated sac, enveloping the respective organs, and which are sometimes numerous, as in the peri- toneum, at other times single as in the pericar- dium, investing these organs in such a manner as not to be contained within, and which, if it were

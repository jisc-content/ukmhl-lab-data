OF ANIMAL LIFE. 331 means only of communicating with external ob- jects, but paralysis of the others, instantly de- stroys both external and internal life. The nervous influence is always propagated from above downwards, and never in the reverse sense. If a nerve be divided in two parts, and the lower part be irritated, the subjacent mus- cles contract; but, however much the other is excited, it will never produce the least con- traction in the muscles situate above ; in the same manner the spinal marrow on being transversely divided, and excited both above and below, the effects are only observable in the last: in respect to motion, the nervous influence is never found to ascend as in respect to sensation. Animal Contractility considered in the Muscles. The muscles especially intended to receive the cerebral influence through the medium of nerve, take also an active part in their own contraction. To exercise this property, to answer to the cere- bral excitement, they should be entire. When- ever their tissue is affected by any injury what- ever, or this tissue is no longer in its natural state, the muscle either remains motionless, or moves with irregularity, although it receives a regular supply of nervous influence. The fol- lowing are divers circumstances that relate to the muscle itself, and prevent or alter its contractions.

From all these considerations it would appear, that there is no epidermis in the deep seated mucous surfaces, and that the abundant quantity of mucous juices constantly poured out by the subjacent glands, act as a substitute to protect the papillae and the corium against the impression of substances foreign to the economy, and con- tained in the internal cavities. There is a cir- cumstance, however, which seems to demon- strate the existence of an epidermis in these parts : I mean the separation of unnatural membranes which might be considered as a kind of exfolia- tion of the epidermis. Many authors have quoted instances of these membranes formed in the blad- der, and expelled through the urinary canal; from the stomach and oesophagus, and expelled by vomiting ; or from the intestines, and expelled with the faeces.

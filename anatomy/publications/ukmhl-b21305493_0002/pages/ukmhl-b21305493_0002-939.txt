There is no visible elaboration effected in the epidermis ; like all other inorganic forms it wears by friction, and is again renewed. Physiologists have not paid sufficient attention to this continued destruction of the epidermis. Its reality is proved as follows : 1st. If its exter- nal surface be rather strongly scraped with a knife, a quantity of dust, soluble in nitric acid, and of a grayish aspect, is obtained. The epidermis becomes whiter in this part, and soon re-assumes its original hue, particularly on being moistened. On applying the knife again, this dust is no longer produced; to produce this an interval of twelve or twenty hours is required. 2ndly. This substance becomes superabundant when the skin has remained long unwashed. Hence the prodigious quantity that is obtained by steeping the feet in water and scraping them, where this healthy precaution has been long neglected. It is remarkably abundant in the soles of the feet. In the corpse it is often seen to form an additional layer to the epidermis, but perfectly distinct from it, and easily removed. This circumstance I attribute to the thickness of the epidermis in this part. It is often noticed in hospital patients after they have remained long in bed without being cleaned. Water naturally removes this substance pro- duced by the destruction of the epidermis, and VOL. II. . 3 M s

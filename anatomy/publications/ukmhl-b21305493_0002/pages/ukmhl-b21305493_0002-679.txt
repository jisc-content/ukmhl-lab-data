SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. to me to contain the most. Next always appeared G37 makes it very fit to lubricate the articulating sur- face undergoing friction, and to weaken the shock of contact. It varies in quantity: there are articulations liberally supplied with it; that of the ancle has in order is the ileo-femoral, the scapulo-femoral, the humero-cubital, &c. There are others where- in hardly any is seen : such are the sterno-clavi- clar, the sterno-costal, the costo-vertebral, &c.; the invariable dryness observed in these articula- tions does not result from the small extent of the synovial membranes, for the synovial bags of the larynx, though much less capacious, are moister. The synovia besides, does not, like the serum of the serous membranes, vary in quantity in every articulation. Although little accustomed to dis- secting the peritoneum, pleura, pericardium, &c. we may observe that two are scarcely ever alike : sometimes it is a mere dew, at other times a real collection of fluid. Here, on the contrary, it is almost invariably the same quantity : this proceeds from the synovial not so readily admitting, as the serous surfaces do, of being sympathetically ex- cited by the diseases of the other organs. The synovia is not liable to the divers altera- tions observed in the serous fluids. I have never witnessed in the articulating surf aces what is called the false inflammatory membrane. The unnatu- ral collections of synovia never contain any of

This ceases but its effects do not, and these effects produce a loss of power in one divi- sion of the muscular system. The other, or the convulsive state, proceeds from the different irri- tations of the cerebral organ, owing to splinters of bone that have entered its substance, inflam- mation of its substance, or that of its membranes, to the various tumours that may form within, to organic injuries, injuries I have seldom seen in the adult, but sometimes in infancy, and to the very causes of compressions ; for this convulsive state is frequently found to coincide with different effusions, with hydrocephalus, &c.

Physicians who attend hospitals for lunatics, have frequently occasion to consult this thermometer.

151 cartilaginous system. forming a uniting medium which becomes firmer as age advances. In the head these kinds of cartilages are consi- derably multiplied ; those of the skull are thicker on the convex than in the concave surface ; from this it follows that the sutures sooner disappear in the latter case than in the former. Wherever they are seen they contribute to unite bones that form cavities : hence, as we have already said, they are less endangered by external injury, the effort being partly lost in their soft tissue, produces less effect than if the cavity were formed of one solid bone. It appears that these cartilages have much more affinity with the phosphate of lime than those of the moveable articulations, that sel- dom admit of ossification, whilst in an advanced age these always become bony ; instances of which are produced in the skull. 1 have remarked, however, that the cartilages of indented surfaces have a greater tendency to ossification, than those of surfaces in juxta-position; at least, it is a more common thing to see the parietal bones united with the occipital and the coronal, than to find an union of the maxillary, the palatine, bones, &c.

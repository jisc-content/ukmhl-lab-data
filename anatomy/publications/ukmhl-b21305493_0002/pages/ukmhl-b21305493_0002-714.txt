GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 072 analysis of the broths produced by each system would be an interesting subject of research. I have found that nearly all varied in aspect, sa- vour and colour. The glands undergo in boiling a phenomenon quite peculiar to these organs : they harden when ebullition begins, and shrink at first in the same manner as every other system ; but, whilst the greater part of tfiese soften again when the pro- cess is continued, so much so as even to be dif- / fused into a pulp, the glands harden in an in- creasing ratio, and will exceed three, or even four times their natural degree of consistence. I have often repeated this experiment. Cooks are also aware of this, since on dressing a gland they are particularly attentive that it should not be boiled for too long a time. The kidneys of the ox will soften ultimately ; those of the sheep, and of man, resist much longer; they soften much sooner, however, than that of the liver, which, of all glands, acquires the greatest density. Another phenomenon that especially distin- guishes the glandular system from other parts, is that, when withdrawn, the moment it has under- gone the sudden contraction common to almost every animal solid submitted to boiling water, it has not, like these, acquired elasticity. If a tendon, a serous, or a mucous surface, &c. be drawn in opposite directions, they will lengthen and suddenly contract, the moment the cause for

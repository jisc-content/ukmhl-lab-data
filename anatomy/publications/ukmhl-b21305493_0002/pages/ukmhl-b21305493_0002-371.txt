329 OF ANIMAL LIFE. and the limbs, or directly from the brain, as in those of the face, of the tongue, of the eyes, &c. There are other proofs of this influence ; the tying, the division, or the compression of a nerve will paralyze the corresponding muscle. If a nerve, laid bare in an animal, be irritated by any means, spasmodic contractions are instantly produced in the muscles. These experiments have been so repeatedly and correctly made by many authors, that I think it useless to dwell upon them any longer; they are met with in every book. Irritation continued for some time on one part of the nerve, will exhaust its influence upon the muscle, this remaining unmoved ; but it is again excited if the irritation be applied to a lower part of the nerve. If this be tyed, the motion ceases when the irritation is above the ligature, but is renewed when the ligature is re- moved or irritation is produced below it. I have remarked that all the nerves of animal life do not appear equally calculated to transmit to the muscles the different irradiations of the brain. In fact, whilst in diseases, in wounds on the head, in our experii ents, &c., the muscles of the limbs are convulsed or paralysed with the utmost facility, those of the abdomen, of the neck, and more particularly those of the chest, only display these phenomena, when the causes of excitement or depression are carried to the

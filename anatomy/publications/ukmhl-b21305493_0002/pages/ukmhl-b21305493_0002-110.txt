OSSEOUS SYSTEM. G8 axis of the motion is also the axis of the lever ; that, on the contrary, if they describe an angle the motion is much more difficult, because its axis is not that of the lever ; and in general, it may be said that the difficulty of the motion is in proportion to the distance between these two axis. This once determined, let us observe that the axis of the motion for circumduction in the femur is evidently a straight line, directed ob- liquely from the head down to the condyles, and consequently removed above from the axis of the bone, by the whole extent of the neck. Now, from what has been stated, it is evident that the difficulty attending circumduction is in a direct sense with the length of the neck, and con- sequently rather considerable. In the humerus, on the contrary, the neck being very short, the axis of the bone is nearly confounded with that of the motion : hence the facility and extent of circumduction. By this proportion, the connec- tions of these motions might strictly be ascer- tained ; the circumduction of the humerus is, to that of the femur, what the length of the neck of the former is to that of the neck of the latter, which shows how much more difficult is the cir- cumduction of the femur than that of the hume- rus. To ascertain this, it is sufficient to know how far the length of the neck of the one exceeds that of the other.

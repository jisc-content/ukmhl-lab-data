OF ANIMAL LIFE; 299 which are much larger and more numerous in the former than in the latter direction ; but this in- crease in the number of vessels and nerves, pro- ceeds from there being many more flexors than extensors, from the former being stronger, and composed of more multiplied fibres; so that each of these fibres is not provided with more vascular and nervous filaments in one of these muscles than in the others. All that has been said re- specting the difference of strength between the fibres of the flexors and those of the extensors, respecting the predominance of the former over the latter, &c. I consider as without foundation. If there be any difference, it is because, as in the foot, the hand, &c. they are more numerous, or disposed to more advantage ; as round the trunk, upon which the abdominal muscles which bend the spine, are at a great distance from the point of resistance ; whilst, in what regards extension, the dorsal muscles perform their office immediately close to that point of resistance; such also as in the neck, wherein the muscles that depress the lower jaw and the head when that bone is fixed, are at a much greater distance from the occipital condyles than those which produce extension. Whatever may be the cause of this superiority of the flexors, it cannot be doubted, 1st. That in hysterical convulsions, in those of infancy, &c. in every spasmodic motion independent of the W]h, the contractions are more frequently pro-

497 MUCOUS SYSTEM. pose. From this experiment an effect is produced nearly similar to that I have seen on causing emphysema by means of different aerial fluids. From what has been said respecting the wrinkles of the mucous membranes, it follows, that in the natural contractions of the hollow organs lined with these membranes, their surface is not much reduced, that they scarcely contract, but fold in- wardly, so that on separating them from the or- gan, in a state of contraction, the surface is nearly equal in extent to that which exists when the organ is dilated. This assertion is perfectly cor- rect in what regards the stomach, the oesophagus, and the large intestines, but it may perhaps not he quite so applicable to the bladder, the interior of which presents smaller wrinkles during contraction, but sufficiently strong not to deviate from the ge- neral law. It is almost the same thing in regard to the gall bladder : here, however, we find another cause. If alternately observed during hunger, and during digestion, the gall bladder will contain double the quantity of bile in the former state, a fact which I have frequently noticed in experi- ments made with this and other views. Now whenever the gall bladder is partly emptied, it does not contract over the remaining bile, with that energy the stomach will, when it contains but little food, or with the same force as the blad- der when filled with little fluid only. The lat- ter then is flabby ; so that its distension or vol. n. K K

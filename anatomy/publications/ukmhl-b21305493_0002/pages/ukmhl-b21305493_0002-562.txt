520 MUCOUS SYSTEM. perature ; they require much time to become pu- trid ; in fact, they remain for a long time unaf- fected in the nose, exposed to the action of damp air; the putrid matter of the intestines is quite inoffensive to them, &c. When removed from the body, and undergoing various experiments, their results are conformable to these facts. All acids act upon them, they are variously coloured by these substances ; exposed to dry air, they thicken by evaporation, and are even frequently reduced to small layers of a brilliant aspect. The mucus of the nose in particular displays this phenome- non. Fourcroy has published a very circumstan- tial analysis of this mucus ; to which he has also added that of the trachea. But what we know respecting the composition of these, should not, howTever, be strictly applied to similar fluids. It will be sufficient, in fact, to examine a certain number of these fluids, to perceive they are not twice the same, that they, more or less thick, or less permanent, differing in their hue, even in their smell, &c. they must necessarily vary in their constituent principles, as the membranes that produce them vary in their structures, in the number and volume of their glands, in the thick- ness of their corion, in the forms of their papillae, in the state of their vascular and nervous systems, &c. I am far from maintaining that the gastric juice is a mucous one ; it is even probable it is produced by exhalation, the glands of the sto-

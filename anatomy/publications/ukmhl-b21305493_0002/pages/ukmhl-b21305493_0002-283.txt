241 FIBROUS SYSTEM. posed in one direction, or at least these fibres not interweaving, â€˜they must necessarily follow the same direction, since they are continued with them. I have tried an experiment, which very evi- dently proves the identity of tendons and aponeu- roses ; it consists in submitting a tendon to ma- ceration for the space of a few days, it then becomes flexible, the fibres separate, and by spreading it in the direction of its thickness, it will form a kind of membrane that cannot possibly be distinguished from a real aponeurosis. Arched Aponeuroses for Insertion. These are much less numerous than the pre- ceding. Whenever a large vessel crosses under a muscle, nature has adopted this means to pre- vent the insertion of the fleshy fibres being inter- rupted ; the diaphragm for the aorta, the soleus for the tibial artery, are instances : the insertion takes place over the convex part, and the vessel crosses under the concavity of the arch, the two extre- mities of which are fixed to the bones. For a long time it was thought that the arteries might be com- pressed under these arches; hence the explanation given of popliteal aneurisms, of apoplexy caused by a reflux towards the head, of the blood ob- structed in its course through the aorta, &c.; but it is most evident, that by contracting, the fleshy VOL.

027 SYNOVI A I, SYSTEM. ARTICLE I. Synovial System of the Joints. 1 am, I believe, the first that has attempted to describe this important function ol the synovial system, and I shall now repeat what I have said elsewhere. I shall first enquire how the synovia is separated, then examine this fluid, and finally, describe the organ from which it proceeds. SECTION i. How the Synovia is separated from the Mass of the Blood. Every fluid distinct from the blood can only be separated from it, to be subsequently trans- mitted to any organ, by one of the three fol- lowing modes:â€”1st.

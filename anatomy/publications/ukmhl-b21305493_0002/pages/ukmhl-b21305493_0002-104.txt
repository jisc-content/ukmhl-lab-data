62 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. several, rotation and circumduction are wanting, and opposition exists in one sense only ; some are singly possessed of no rotation : finally, some are not calculated to perform rotation, circumduction, and opposition, but merely intended for gliding. From this it is seen, that nature here, as well as elsewhere, is gradual in her progress; that from the most moveable articulations to those the least so, there are several degrees of diffe- rence ; that she gradually proceeds to the immove- able articulations, wherein there is merely a glid- ing motion, such as that observed in the carpus, in the tarsus, &c. Another intermediate articu- lation might be included between the latter spe- cies of motion and complete immobility; it is that of the symphysis pubis, which, with that of the humerus, ma.y be considered as forming the two most distant orders in the series of moveable arti- culations. Every individual articulation I have just been mentioning, displays contiguous surfaces. It is the general character of those intended for mo- tion. This rule, however, admits of an excep- tion ; it is the articulation of the bodies of the vertebrae, in which continuity and mobility are united. The symphysis pubis is also partly con- tinuous in its surfaces, and sometimes performs obscure motions. Hence proceeds a division of the moveable articulations, into those with conti- nuous and those with contiguous surfaces.

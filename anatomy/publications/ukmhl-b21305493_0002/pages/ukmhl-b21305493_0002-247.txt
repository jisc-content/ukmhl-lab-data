205 FIBROUS SYSTEM* rotic tunic has caused sympathetic vomiting, &c. 2dly. Intense pain arising from any part whatever, particularly from the fibrous sys- tem, considerably increases the sensible or- ganic contractility of the heart, and thus causes a sympathetic acceleration in the circulation of the blood. I have seen a man in whom Desault was reducing a luxation, suffer such violent pains from the great distension of the ligaments, that he could not retain his faeces, such was the con- traction of the rectum. It is evident that in these sympathies the fibrous system sometimes exercises its influence over the others; sometimes also these exercise their action upon the fibrous system. It is on be- ing extended, that the peculiar mode of animal sensibility it enjoys is so powerfully excited, as to cause in the economy a remarkable sympathetic disturbance. The ancients, I presume, mistook all the white parts, the ligaments, the tendons, &c. for nerves, on account of the serious accidents they had observed resulting from their distension, in sprains, in the complex luxations of the knee, of the elbow, of the instep,â€”luxations that cannot take place without a violent extension of a number of ligaments, of aponeurotic and tendinous parts, &c. A wound from the sabre, that divides the li- gaments of the tarsus, and bruises from the fall of heavy weights, are attended with far less serious consequences than a false position that distends

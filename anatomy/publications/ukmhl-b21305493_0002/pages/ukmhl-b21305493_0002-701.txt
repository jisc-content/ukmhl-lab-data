659 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. which the fibrous sheaths and their tendons seemed to form but one in the fore and middle fingers. The inflammatory phenomena of the synovial sheaths are particularly remarkable in whitlows, one species of which disease is evidently seated in those of the fingers, and is analogous to the in- flammation of the pleura, of the peritoneum, and to that of the articulations. It is more dangerous than that of the synovial membranes, forming bags or purses, because the fibrous membrane that surrounds the inflamed one is not calculated to yield, and thus to accommodate the swelling, as the cellular tissue enveloping these synovial vesicles will form contractions, frequently necessitating the use of the knife. Ido not know if the synovial tissue of the tendons is liable to these slow and tubercular in- flammations, which the serous and articular syno- vial systems share in common. Its vital properties, and those of the tissue, appear to be perfectly the same as those of the latter. The same as this, it sel- dom admits of being sympathetically influenced by the other organs; it remains unmoved amidst the confusion of other systems in acute diseases; it continues healthy amidst their alterations aris- ing from chronic affections. I have also observed that every one of its affections are almost local ones; for instance, never, as in the serous system, is there a dropsical diathesis observed ; that is to say, a case in which all the synovial bags fill at the same time. u u 2

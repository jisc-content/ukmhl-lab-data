394 MUSCULAR SYSTEM long time that this colour is influenced by gene- ral disease. I have remarked that the varieties of shades observed in the muscles of adult subjects, even in the perfect state, especially distinguishes these organs from those of the foetus, which in general are uniformly made. This difference proceeds from our not being exposed in the early age to the action of a multiplicity of agents, which in the subsequent stages of life modify ad infinitum the essential functions, and consequently the nu- tritive process. It is in these varieties of shades in the hue of the muscular system of the adult, that we find the blood circulated bv the arteries has positively nothing to do with it: this fluid in fact, is uniform in respect to colour, and not liable to change. A multiplicity of circumstances in the adult will cause a difference of muscular contraction: motion is the most essential. The sedentary man is remarkable for the flaccidity of his muscles, particularly if they be compared with those of every active man. This phenomenon is not only displayed in the general habit, but also in parti- cular parts, the arm of the baker, the calves of the dancer, the shoulders of the porter, &c. establish this fact.

At the Hotel Dieu, I at- tend two females, who, during the catamenia, (consequent whenever the mucous surface of the womb is very active,) cannot for any length of time retain the urine in the bladder, which without the interference of the will contracts to expel the fluid the moment it is received into this organ: at other times nothing particular is ob- served in the evacuation of the urine.

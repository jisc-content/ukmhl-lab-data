OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 10 stance, except it be in the spare quantity of cel- lular tissue contained in this canal, and because this function has been suppressed in the centre, it becomes very active round the circumference of the bone. This increase of activity in the exter- nal exhatants, promotes the formation of the com- pact tissue that is developed precisely at the same time as that of the canal, whose parieties it - forms, so that at this period of ossification, ex- halation and absorption seem to be in these two parts of the bone quite in a reverse state; the one very active externally to supply the calcareous phosphates with which the parenchyma already farmed is impregnated ; the other displaying the same activity internally to rob it of the gelatine, which being absorbed, leaves room for the forma- tion of the medullary canal. It is only in the humerus, radius, ulna, the femur, tibia, fibula, and the clavicle, that a regular medullary cavity is formed. The interior of the ribs of the pha- langes, which in form approach tb these, are filled with common cellular tissue, and scarcely ever contain that kind of fine tissue found in the mid- dle of the above mentioned bone, and only to be met with in the medullary canal. This canal does not extend beyond the body of the bone. It disappears where the compact tissue begins to diminish, being replaced by the cancelli that fill the heads of the bone. ItsTorm is cylindri- cal ; its direction straight.. It does not vary its

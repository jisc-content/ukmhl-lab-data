890 EPIDEKMOIDAL .SYSTEM. lar tissue especially contributes to form, as the fungous, schirrous tumours, &c. &c. Hence it is obvious, that the system of the epidermis does not partake of the general systems common to all the other organs. It does not rest then upon the same basis common to every organized part; in this point of view it is inorganic as it were. No fibres are seen in the interior of this tissue : in general it is not very resistant, and is lacerated by the slightest distention, except in the fingers and hand where it is thicker. The action of air has little or no influence upon the epidermis: but when, after having been re- moved, a considerable surface is exposed to it, it rather hardens, becomes in some degree more con- sistent, and is not quite so easily torn. Excepting the nails and hair, this in the natural state is of all the organs the least altered by desiccation; It is also made rather more transparent by this pre- paration ; but re-assumes its former appearance on being again immersed in water, which proves it contained some in this state. The action of air, so powerful upon the skin that has become putrid, leaves it perfectly uninjured : it is merely raised but does not putrify. Separated by this process, and cleared of the putrid substances which might have adhered to it, it does not exhale any offensive smell: long exposed to damp air by itself, and perfectly isolated from all the adjacent

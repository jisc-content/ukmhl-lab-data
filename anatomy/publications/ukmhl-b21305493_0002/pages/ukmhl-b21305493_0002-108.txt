66 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. kind of articulation in the upper part of the limbs, â€”atwo-fold advantage resulting from this disposi- tion : on the one hand, very distant from that part of the limb most directly endangered by external mechanical injury, it more readily escapes luxa- tion, to which it is exposed by its want of soli- dity ; on the other hand, it is calculated by this disposition, to impart motion to the whole limb, compensating for its deficiency in the inferior articulations, in which solidity excludes motion in every direction. For instance, the two articula- tions just mentioned are not only intended for the humerus and the femur, but also for the whole limb, which they move in various directions. Thus it is that anchylosis in this part renders the limb totally useless, whilst in the inferior articu- lations it only destroys partial motions. The peculiar motion of this kind of articula- tion necessarily implies a semi-spherical form in its articulating surfaces, concave if they receive, convex if they are inserted. This form, in fact, is the only one calculated for the united motions of general opposition, rotation, and circumduc- tion : it is actually the form of the superior parts of the humerus, with the shoulder bone ; of that of the femur, with the os innominatum. The bone that moves is possessed of the convex surface, the other of the concave one. Some species of animals present quite a reverse disposition: I

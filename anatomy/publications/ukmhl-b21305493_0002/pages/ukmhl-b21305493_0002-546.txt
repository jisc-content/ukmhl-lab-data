MUCOUS SYSTEM. Â£04* butes to prove that the membrane of the cavity, tnat of the fallopean tube, &c. belong to the sys- tem we are considering: hence in catarrhal affec- tions of the pituitary membrane and the back part of the mouth, the ear is often implicated : hence the ear, as well as the mucous surfaces, is frequently the seat of hemorrhage, and polypi originate from it, as they do from the nose and surface of the womb. Every discharge from the ear has been considered as proceeding from a collection in that cavity. But how, in a part hardly possessed of any cellular tissue at all, in a part completely composed of bones, could a ga- thering of pus be conceived ? Besides, as we are perfectly aware, the fibrous system to which the periosteum of this part should belong, will hardly ever admit of suppuration. Every thing then leads to a belief that these discharges are nothing more than the produce of an auricular catarrh, some- times of an acute, at other times a chronic type* I have besides a recent and decisive fact on this head. I have observed in a subject liable to such discharges during life, a remarkable redness and thickness in the membrane of the tympanum, but not the slightest sign of erosion. The ear sup- purates as the urethra, the vagina, &c.: it is not a new fluid formed by suppuration, it is the same which naturally flows through the tube, which being increased in quantity, is accidentally ex- pelled through an outlet in the membrane of the tympanum.

FIBRO-CAUTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 26& as well as those of the ends of bones, remain separate. The gelatinous part interposed, appears to pre- dominate in the infant, in the articulating fibro- cartilages, and in those for insertion, over the fibrous part. This is remarkable in the interver- tebral substances, wherein that kind of mucilage which occupies the centre, and in which the fibres also are more striking, is in a reverse state with age in respect to quantity. In the foetus al- most every thing is homogeneous in the pubis, for the transverse fibres become apparent in a more advanced age only. The articulations of the knee, the jaw, &c. display the very same disposi- tion in their fibro-cartilages. A greater quantity of gelatine is then extracted from them, and by ebullition they have the more of that smooth aspect that characterizes the cartilages. The membranous fibro-cartilages, as those of the ear, of the eyes, and especially of the nose, are in general formed at an early period : they are very striking in the foetus. In two ascephali, I have observed, that here, as in every other part of the head, they were of a very remarkable size, much exceeding the natural state. Besides, the whole fibro-cartilaginous system is in the foetus remarkably soft, supple, and binding.

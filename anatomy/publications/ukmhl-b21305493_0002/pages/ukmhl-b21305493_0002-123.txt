OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 81 early age, and the slowness and difficulty that at- tend them in the latter. Cartilages are not, in this order of articulations, as in the preceding, intended for the purpose of union, but by their smooth and polished surfaces for that of motion. In respect to the synovial membrane exclu- sively met with in this order, such is its excessive tenuity, that it can hardly be considered as uniting the surfaces, and its use seems restricted to the exhalation of synovia. It is not the same thing with muscles ; they might be considered at the same time, round the moveable articulations, both as powers for the whole of the bone, and as resisting agents for their heads ; they prevent displacements by act- ing round and supporting these, their resistance being in proportion to the efforts that tend to dislocation. In fact, it is in great motions these efforts are the most exerted. Now the muscles ad- jacent to the articulation, strongly contracted, and hardened by the contractions, effectually oppose the tendency of the head of the bone to separate from the corresponding one. During rest, when the muscles relaxed, afford little or no resistance, there is no effort to oppose. A limb rendered use- less by palsy, would much sooner be dislocated than another by exterior mechanical violence. The medium of union, in the order of move- VOL. II. <5

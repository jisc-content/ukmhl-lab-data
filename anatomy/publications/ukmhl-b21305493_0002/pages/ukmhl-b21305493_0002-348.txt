MUSCULAR SYSTEM 306 constitutes the phenomenon of the antagonist muscles; two muscles are such, that the one cannot be extended without the other con- tracting, and reciprocally. Let us examine what share the contractility of the tissue has in this phenomenon; its influence should be properly distinguished from that of the vital powers, an influence that has hitherto been completely over- looked. Whenever a muscle rests in its medium po- sition, it cannot possibly be removed from it, but by the influence of the vital powers, by that of animal contractility, or of sensible organic con- tractility, because in this position the contracti- lity of tissue of its antagonist is in equilibrium with its own, and an additional force is therefore required to overpower the opposing one. If this muscle, however, should be placed in one of the extremes of the preceding positions; for in- stance, in adduction, abduction, flexion, exten- sion, &c. then there will be inequality of action between the antagonists in regard to the con- tractility of tissue; that which is extended the most will make a greater effort to contract than that which is already contracted. To main- tain an equilibrium, it is then requisite the vital powers should continue to influence the con- tracted muscles. Thus every extreme position of the limbs, and of any moveable part, can only be continued in the natural state, by means of the

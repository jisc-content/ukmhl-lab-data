Changes will also take place in the sensibility of the glands which become connected with fluids heterogeneous to them in their na- tural state: hence, the innumerable varieties we observe in the secreted fluids, particularly in dis- eases. I have spoken of these varieties in the mucous fluids. They are not less numerous in the liver, and particularly in the kidneys. In the corpse, the savour, hue, consistence, and smell of the cystic bile, are detected in a thousand dif- ferent states, for who is not acquainted with the innumerable alterations of the urine ? The saliva is not so variable: in diseases, how different it is from its natural appearance. If we observe for some time the different evacuations in diseases we shall easily ascertain the multiplicity of modifica- tions of which they are susceptible. Nothing has less resemblance to urine and bile than the fluids which are sometimes expelled from the bladder and the liver: now from whence do all these varieties proceed ? It is not the variation of organic sensibility, that, as I have said before, places the organ in connection with substances which in a healthy state it would have repelled.

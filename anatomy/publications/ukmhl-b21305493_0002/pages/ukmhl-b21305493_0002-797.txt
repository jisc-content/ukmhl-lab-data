DKKMOIDAL SYSTEM. 755 readily penetrated on the fleshy than on the op- posite side ; 3dly. These innumerable apertures are not observed on the internal surface of the corium in the back of the hand and foot; it is smooth, whitish, particularly after a few days maceration. It is the same in respect to the skin of the scrotum, prepuce, and even of the labia pudendi; their tissue is much tighter, and no interstices are left; so that, although it is much thinner than that of the limbs and of the trunk, it contains nearly as much substance. In respect to the corium corresponding to the hair and beard, nothing more is to be seen than the open- ings giving a passage to the hair, very distinct from those I was mentioning just now, which are in the shape of a bag, and do not completely perforate the corium. Here then are three very distinct modifications observed in the internal surface of the corium of the dermis. The first and last are found in a few parts only, whilst the second is almost general, admitting merely of a few distinctions in the trunk, limbs, and head. These differences, how- ever, do not imply a variety in the nature, but singly in the form. Stretched out and fibrous in the first, the tissue of the dermis draws nearer and is somewhat condensed in the second, and by that condensation the areolae are made less dis- tinct. But there is a very simple way of obtain- ing a proper investigation, except in such parts 3 c 2

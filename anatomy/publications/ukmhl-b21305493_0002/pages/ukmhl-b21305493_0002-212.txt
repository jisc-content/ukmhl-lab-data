CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 170 cartilages. I have observed a distinction in their tissues, as well as in the tissue of the latter, in re- spect to that of the cartilages of ossification, inas- much as the latter are overrun with several greyish lines not produced in the others. Whenever the cartilages for ossification are divided in any di- rection, their divided surfaces present several small dots, that are the divided ends of these ves- sels, which, although they do not yet circulate blood, contain a fluid of a much darker hue than that of the cartilaginous tissue. SECTION If. State of the Cartilaginous System, in the subsequent Ages. In proportion as age advances, the cartilages grow harder, stronger, and less elastic. Gela- tine, chiefly intended for their nutrition, assumes a particular character; for it is sufficiently known, that the glues extracted from young animals are much superior to those proceeding from aged ones. The difference between a calfâ€™s foot and that of an ox, in preparing jellies, is well understood in the kitchen. This distinction in the substance, of which cartilages are essentially composed, and which undoubtedly constitutes their nutritive elements, sufficiently proves that it does not always remain in these organs, but is therein habituallv exhaled and absorbed, in the

GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 678 tion than urine; whenever the latter fluid is very acid, it may in some degree prevent putrefaction: but if the liver and kidneys be comparatively exposed to its action, the latter, as I have said, will resist its effects much longer. It appears in general, that the motion of fluids through the excretory ducts is by no means so rapid, as the circulation of blood through the veins, nor even as that of lymph through the absorbents: this even will be obviously proved by the following considerations. The urine in- cessantly flows through the ureters, as is evidently ascertained by the fistulae in the loins. Now dur- ing the time the bladder fills by this uninterrupted flow, ten times as much blood flows through a vein equal in diameter to the ureter, and a much greater quantity of lymph through the thoracic duct. The degree of motion, however, is liable to numerous varieties; during the inactive state of the glands it is ten times less than when they are excited ; the proof is in the salivary fistulae, &c. With what rapidity liquids are conveyed by the ureters is perfectly known. Volume, Direction,, Termination of the Excretory Ducts. These tubes vary in size. 1st.

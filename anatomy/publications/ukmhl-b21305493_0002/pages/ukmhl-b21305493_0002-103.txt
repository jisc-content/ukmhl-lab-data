61 OSSEOUS SVSTEM. included between these. From this we perceive, that circumduction is a motion that comprehends all those of opposition, and in which the bone, instead of proceeding from one part to the oppo- site one, as in the preceding case, moves from one point to the next, the end describing a circle, which is the basis of the cone I have mentioned, and the more extended as the bone itself is longer. It is easily conceived, that in this sys- tem, such bones only as are characterized by a vague motion of opposition, are calculated for circumduction. 3dly. Rotation is quite different from the pre- ceding motion. In the first locomotion is in- cluded in the progress of the bone from one part to another; here the organ remains in the same situation ; it only turns on its axis. The humerus and the femur enjoy this mode, which is deno- minated simple motion. 4thly. Gliding is within the attributes of every articulation. It is a dull motion, by which two surfaces meet in a reverse direction, by gliding, as it were, the one over the other. This motion is included in all the others, but frequently exists alone. From such notions in respect to articulating motions, the division of the class of moveable articulations into processes is easily conceived. In fact, there are articulations that include every motion; others are deprived of rotation; in

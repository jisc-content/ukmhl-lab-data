Active Sympathiesâ€ž If any part of the mucous system be irritated, inflamed, or excited, every vital power may be brought separately into action in the other systems. 7 Sometimes the animal contractility is sympa- thetically called into action ; thus will the dia- phragm, the intercostal and abdominal muscles, contract and produce either sneezing, by irritating the pituitary membrane, or coughing, by irri- tating the membrane of the bronchia, or even the surface of the stomach, which, as is well known, has no connexion whatever with the chest. The general spasm that seizes every muscle the moment a foreign body forces its way between the mucous ridges of the epiglottis has been re- peatedly ascertained. A stone in the bladder, or in the ureter, by causing a sympathetic contrac- tion of the cremaster muscle, produce a retraction of the testis. Physicians, in my opinion, might derive great advantage from a knowledge of these sympathies. In apoplexy, wherein the bronchia is sometimes filled with mucous fluids, the pa- tient is unable to expectorate : the action of am- monia on the pituitary membrane will produce the two-fold effect; First, of stimulating the brain as VOL.

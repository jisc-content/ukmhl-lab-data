FIBROUS SYSTEM. 217 that has been dyed red. In general it appears, that of all the fibrous system, the tendons are possessed of the least vitality. On dissecting them in a living animal, I found they had exactly the same qualities as in the corpse; the white juices they are permeated with do not flow under the knife, they are dry, and are removed in layers. The temperature appears to be very low ; for in general the degree of heat in an organ is pro- portionate to the quantity of blood vessels it receives. Tf in the body they attain the general tempe- rature, it arises from that of the surrounding or- gans. No caloric is separated in their tissue: the tendons have a remarkable affinity with gelatine, and even with the calcareous phosphate, and in parts where they slide over a bone, and under- go considerable friction, they present a degree of hardness attributed by authors to pressure, com- paring it to the induration in the sole of the foot, but which is evidently owing to an exhalation of the two preceding substances in the tendinous tissue; an exhalation determined by the motion, and from which real ossification results. In this manner, as we have stated, are the different sesamoid bones formed, and particularly the patella, of which the tissue evidently differs from that of others, because, besides the gelatine and earthy substance with which it is penetrated, it has also a portion of fibrous tissue which is not

MUSCULAR SYSTEM 376 two parts together, but merely to contract the aperture round which they are situate. The anus, when it is not dilated by the faeces, is closed by its sphincter. The mouth remains shut as long as the depressors, the levators, and the ab- ductors of the lips remain inactive. The eye remains shut as long as the levator of the upper eyelid is relaxed. I observe in this respect, that the lower eyelid not being provided with a de- pressor, it is the other which essentially concurs to open or shut the eye, and as its muscle cannot remain in a permanent state of contraction, its alternate relaxations produce that repeated wink- ing which takes place when the eyes are open; they are to the eye, what the alternate transfers of weight from one leg to the other are to these limbs when the body is stationary. At every in- stant, the muscle relaxes, and the sphincter in- stantly contracts; it contracts, and the sphincter is distended : winking then, is formed by the ha- bitual contention between the levators and the or- bicular muscles. During sleep, the eye is not closed by the contraction of this muscle; it is relaxed like the rest, because the preceding being inac- tive, the eyelid drops downwards by its own weight; it communicates, as it were, the motion to the orbicular muscle it contains; whereas, during the day, it is the latter that communicates that motion.

OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 78 other, no more than for the general phenomena of growth. This order of articulations gradually diminishes with age, and the bones are united by the ossification of the slight interposed cartilage. The preceding order less frequently disappears. In very elderly subjects, however, 1 have found different articulations of this kind that were im- perceptible, especially those of the maxillary bones with each other. 3d. The articulations, with implanted sur- faces, do not borrow their solidity from the me- chanism of the part; they are entirely indebted for it to the connections of the surfaces that are so united and woven together, that displacement cannot take place. There is but one instance of this articulation; we find it in the tooth with the jaw-bone. Here age does not erase the articulation, and does not, on this account, confound together the two bones as in the preceding orders, because the means of union consists in the palatine membrane that belongs to the mucous system, and which, from that organization, never has any tendency to ossification ; whilst, in the preceding cases, the interposed cartilage has a natural propensity to impregnate itself with calcareous phosphate.

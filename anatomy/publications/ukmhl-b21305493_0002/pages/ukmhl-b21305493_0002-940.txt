898 EP1 DERM 01 DAL SYSTEM. which being mixed with the residue of the per- spiration, renders bathing a natural want, as I have previously observed. Although this sub- stance is neither exhaled nor absorbed, and it ap- pears to be produced by friction, the epidermis in this respect may still be ranked amongst the emunctories of the body, since it is renewed by a substance supplied by the dermis in proportion as it is destroyed. Since the epidermis is not possessed of vital properties, it is obvious that it cannot be the seat of any sympathies whatever, which are aberra- tions of these properties. Hence its vitality is exceedingly obscure; nay, I even doubt if it has any. We might be induced to think it a semi- organized matter, which nature has interposed be- tween the exterior inert bodies and the dermis, which is essentially organized, to form the transi- tion and link of communication. The epidermis is possessed of a property very distinct from those of most of the other systems ; it is that of being reproduced; the new being in every respect similar to that which has been re- moved. This even separates it from a fewT other systems, which like the cellular system, throw out granulations when they have been exposed, but which are only irregularly reproduced, and very different from their natural state. How can the reproduction of the epidermis be explained ? Is it the pressure of atmospheric air that makes the

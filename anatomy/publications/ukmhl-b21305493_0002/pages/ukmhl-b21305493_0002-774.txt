Although the secretions are not very active in this subject, the glandular system generally predominates. The salivary and pancreatic glands are larger in proportion than subsequently. The liver is enormous: the kidneys are also propor- tionally larger than those of the adult; probably the mucous glands partake of this disposition, al- though I have made no very precise enquiries on this point. Several vary in their forms; the kidneys, for instance, evidently display knobs, whilst, in a subsequent stage, their surface is almost smooth, nor is the hue the same. This distinction is particularly obvious in the salivary and the la- chrymal glands. Whitish in the adult, these glands display a remarkable redness, of which they are deprived by ablution, and which does not depend upon the blood circulated through their vessels, but is a part of their tissue. This hue never as- sumes so deep a shade in the pancreas, although the texture of this organ is nearly the same. The glands, like the other parts, are remarkably soft and delicate at that stage. They divide and give way with the greatest facility, and their

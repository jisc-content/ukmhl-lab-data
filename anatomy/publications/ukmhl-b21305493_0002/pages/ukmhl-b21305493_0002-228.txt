186 FIBROUS SYSTEM. ture. A muscle and its tendon form an organic apparatus, and not a simple organ. What is the nature of the fibrous tissue ? It is unknown, because it is not found possessed of such properties as would characterize it; it has none but negatives, of those of the muscular tissue cha- racterized by contractility, and of those of the nervous tissue marked by sensibility. It is always found in a passive state ; it obeys the action im- parted to it, but of itself is incapable of any. It constitutes between the organs in which it is found, and the skin, the cellular tissue, the car- tilages, the serous membranes, &c., a very essen- tial distinction. It was incorrect to refer all these parts to the same class, under the deno- mination of white organsâ€”an idle vague expres- sion, that refers only to external appearances, to a comparison of analysis still incomplete, and not at all applicable to the texture, the vital pro- perties, the vitality, and functions of the organs. Fourcroy had foreseen that this too general a division should be subordinate to ulterior ex- periments. Let this be as it may, the following lines will give the result obtained from the fibrous tissue, when submitted to maceration, ebullition, desicca- tion, and to the action of acids, &c. Submitted to maceration in a moderate degree of temperature, the fibrous tissue remains a long time

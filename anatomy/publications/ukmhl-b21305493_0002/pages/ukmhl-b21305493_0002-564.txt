622 MUCOUS SYSTEM. i It also explains why, whenever these substances might prove injurious, these fluids shower in a greater profusion over their surfaces. The con- tinuance of the bougie in the urethra, of an in- strument in the vagina to compress a polypus, or in the fossse nasales for the same purpose ; the tube fixed in the lachrymal sac, and that adapted to the oesophagus as a substitute for deglutition, ne- cessarily produce in the mucous surfaces corre- sponding to these instruments a more abundant secretion of the fluids with which they are habi- tually full; in short, a real catarrh. This is one of the essential reasons that prevents an elastic bougie from remaining stationary in the trachea. The superabundant mucus then separated by ob- structing the apertures of the instrument, require it to be repeatedly cleaned, and may even threaten the patient with suffocation, as Desault himself has observed ; although he has, as I have stated in my book on Chirurgical Operations, reaped great advantage from their use. I must even add, that since my publication on the membranes, I have attempted to fix a tube in the trachea of a dog, and that the animal soon died after it, his bronchia being filled with a frothy fluid, which had evidently caused suffocation. It appears then, that every excitement of the mucous surfaces, if rather quick, causes in the cor- responding glands a remarkable increase of ac- tion. But bow can this excitement, which does

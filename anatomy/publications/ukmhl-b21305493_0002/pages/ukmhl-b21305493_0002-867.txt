825 DEUMOIDAL SYSTEM. nium, sternum, &c.; why, on the contrary, in the scrotum, fold of the arm, the arm-pits, &c., it is so easily effected ; why, in dissecting tumours, it is so strongly recommended to spare the healthy integuments, &c. When the skin is extended, the fibres that form its areolse are separated from each other, and the capacity of these areolse is increased : their wfidth becomes particularly ob- vious on the internal surface of the dermis; for, as all the pores of the external surface perforate the tissue in an oblique direction, distention merely reduces the width of these small tubes without increasing their orifice : thus, whilst the internal surface discovers numerous and extensive inter- stices, this remains continuous, but discloses these interstices, by which it is made transparent wherever they exist; hence the marble-like appearance observed in the skin of the abdomen of women who have borne many children. When- ever the skin is drawn, the internal areolee con- tract, and are even obliterated. The external surface containing none, cannot possibly be so much reduced in the wddth, so that a dispropor- tion between the external and the internal sur- faces ensues; hence, as I have said before, the convexity assumed by the former on being im- mersed in boiling water ; hence also, the uneven- ness and external roughness caused by cold, which forces the dermis to contract. This phe- nomenon besides is never produced but when

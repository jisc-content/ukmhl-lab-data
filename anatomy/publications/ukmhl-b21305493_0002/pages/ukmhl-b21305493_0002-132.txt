90 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. mission of blood into the vessels, forms in the centre of these ends. These new rudiments are formed at the expense of the cartilage that gradually contracts between the body of the bone and the heads; after some time, there only remains a thin partition, that also be- comes ossified; so that the bone becomes solid throughout its whole length. The secondary dots, that had formed in the different apophyses, also unite, by which means, its substance becomes every where homogeneous. Nature has rarely completed this work before the ages of sixteen or eighteen years. Progress of Ossification in the Flat Bones. In these bones, the mode of ossification varies, those that are symmetrical, constantly display two or more of these dots on each side of the median line, corresponding with each other; in some in- stances, one forms over the line. When these points of ossification are of equal number, they are placed on the sides, if not, one is formed upon the line itself. Sometimes the irregular bones have but one, such as the parietal for instance, at other times several are formed, as in the temporal bones; but in such cases, they never assume a parallel disposition with each other, but merely correspond with those of the opposite bone.

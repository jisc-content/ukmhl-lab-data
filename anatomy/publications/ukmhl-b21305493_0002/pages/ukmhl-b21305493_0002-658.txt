616 SEROUS SYSTEM. periinents in which part of their intestines are left out, they are also seen, if left loose for a few mo- ments, to tear them without any visible pain. Whenever the serous system comes in contact with external bodies,, their natural state is altered ; they inflame, as is seen when the peritoneum, and the tunica vaginalis testis are laid bare ; as is also observed whenever a foreign body is introduced * and acts upon them. To effect these artificial ad- hesions between the parietiesof these membranes, physicians frequently resort to these means, which would be ineffectual in the mucous membranes. The different morbific irritations much more fre- quently inflame the serous surfaces, which, in that state acquire a very, high degree of sensibility, supe- rior even to that of the integuments; so that these surfaces when inflamed, would be equally unfit for integuments, because they would be painfully affected by external bodies. Sensible organic contractility is wanting in the serous system ; but the other corresponding pro- perties are in permanent action: 1st. In the ha- bitual exhalation and absorption carried on in this system : 2dly. In nutrition, the latter properties then predominate in this system; thus is it that all their diseases are connected with them ; the acute and chronic inflammations, attended with tubercles, adhesions, dropsies, exhalation of pus, lacteal serum, &c., all proceed from excess, defi- ciency, or adulteration in these two properties of

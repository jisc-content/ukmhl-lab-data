It it well known with what rapidity the fluids pass from the stomach to the intestines, how long, on the contrary, the solid food re- mains in the former of these organs, &c. The powers of organic muscles are incompa- rably greater in the phenomena of life than in our experiments. Once laid bare, the action of the heart becomes weak, and in general irregu- lar ; there is no kind of proportion between the power required to force the blood to the distance of seven or eight feet from the punctured carotid of a dog, and the strength of contractions caused by the strongest stimulant. In the heart removed from the body, no contraction in our experiments is equal to that which produces vomiting, &c. &c. Calculations ad infinitum have been resorted to, to ascertain the powers of contractions of the organic as well as of the other muscles, and they have produced the same varieties in their results. How, in fact, can the degrees of any action which a thousand causes may change momentarily, be submitted to calculation, not only in distinct in- dividuals, but in the same subject?

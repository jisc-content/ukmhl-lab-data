MUSCULAR SYSTEM OF ORGANIC LIFE. This system is not so liberally extended throughout the economy as the preceding. The whole, when compared with that of the latter, which forms more than one third of the body, offers, in this respect, a very remarkable diffe- rence. Its position is also different; it is con- centrated ; 1st. In the chest, where the heart and the oesophagus belong to it; 2dly. In the abdomen; the stomach and the intestines be- ing partly formed by it; 3dly. In the pelvis, where it contributes to form the bladder, and even the womb, although the latter belongs to generation, which is a distinct function of organic life. This system then occupies the centre of the trunk, does not interfere with the limbs, and is secured from exterior injury; while the other placed superficially, forming almost entirely the limbs, appears, as we have before stated, to be intended in the trunk to protect the other or- gans, as much as to perform the various motions VOL.

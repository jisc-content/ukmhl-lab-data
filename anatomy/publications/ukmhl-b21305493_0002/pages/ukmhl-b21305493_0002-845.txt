803 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. subcutaneous nervous system, from which pass all the branches that penetrate the dermis. These branches in crossing with the arteries and veins the areolae of the dermis, and seemingly forming numerous anastomoses, insinuate themselves into the pores which open into the internal areolae, and undoubtedly terminate in giving origin to the papillae. It should ever be remarked that the hand, wherein the papillae are remarkably conspi- cuous, contains in proportion to its surface a much greater quantity of - subcutaneous nerves than any other part of the body. Absorbents. An innumerable quantity of absorbents twine under the skin : in this part, even they are more readily investigated ; every vein is surrounded with them ; several clusters of these tubes are found in their interstices, so that a layer com- posed of absorbents disposed in a continuous membrane, seems in the limbs to separate the fasciae from the skin. It cannot be doubted but the greater part of these vessels originate in the corium, and that they convey to the blood both fat and cellular lymph, as well as the materials intended for the nutrition of its fibres. But is there a peculiar order of branches, open- ing at the surface of the epidermis, and intended to absorb in certain cases heterogeneous sub- stances ?

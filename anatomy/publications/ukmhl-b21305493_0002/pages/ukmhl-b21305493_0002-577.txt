I can affirm there never exists such a very per- manent proportion between the spleen and the stomach, either in the state of plenitude or in that of vacuity, that these two circum- stances should, of necessity, coincide ; and that if the first organ, under various circumstances, is increased or reduced, it is not always precisely in a reverse sense to the stomach. To ascertain this, as Lieutand did, I tried experiments upon dogs: but the differences in size and age of those brought to me, made me rather apprehen- sive I had not been able to compare properly the spleen. I have repeated them on guinea-pigs of the same breed, of the same age, and compara- tively examined some whilst the stomach was empty, the others when it was full. In almost every instance I have found the volume of the spleen nearly the same, or at least the distinc- tion very immaterial. In other experiments, however, I have observed, that under various circumstances the spleen varies in bulk, and especially in weight; but this was indistinct both during and after digestion. From all this it appears, that if, during the va- cuity of the stomach, there is such a thing as a

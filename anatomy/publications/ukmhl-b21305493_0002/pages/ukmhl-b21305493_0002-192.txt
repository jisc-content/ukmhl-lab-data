150 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. out this interference, could only have existed in the centre. 3dly. In the third genus, the cartilaginous layer that lines the projections and depressions on the ends of two bones that are reciprocally opposed to each other, are found nearly of an uniform thickness, as is seen in the elbow, the knee, &c. so that the pressure bears equally upon the whole articulating surface. 4thly. In the fourth and fifth genera, the carti- laginous crusts moulded over the surfaces of the bones, display also nearly the same thickness in every part. I have found that on the bones of an adult, this thickness was nearly a line and a half in the articulation of the radius and ulna, the atlas and occiput, one line in the carpal and me- tacarpal articulations. SECTION II. Forms of the Cartilages of immoveable Articulations. Th e cartilages are met with in two kinds of im- moveable articulations only, namely, in those with surfaces in juxta-position, and those with indented surfaces. They form in each a layer remarkably slight, continued with the two bones that articu- late together, arising from their bony part, simi- lar to that above described, of the same nature, and

CARTILAGINOUS system. 153 SECTION I. Tissue proper to the Cartilaginous System. The proper cartilaginous tissue presents a plexus of fibres so closely interwoven, that at first it appears completely homogeneous, and formed by a mass of gelatine without any particular or- der or direction. However, with more attention, longitudinal fibres are observed, crossed by others in a transverse sense. Th ese fibres are more apparent in the cartilages at the ends of the moveable bones than in the others. They have infinitely less suppleness than the fibres of the fibro-cartilaginous substances: thus the latter admit of being bent without being parted, whilst the former will snap at the least attempt; the ruptured part is constantly smooth, and displays no unevenness. The cartilaginous tissue is remarkable for a num- ber of characteristics that distinguish it from all others. Except the tissue of the bone, none will resist putrefaction and maceration so long a time as this. In a corpse completely putrefied, this tissue is found almost entirely sound, retaining its appearance, its texture, and frequently even its natural whiteness. I have kept in water for a long space of time cartilaginous substances that were no ways affected by it, except in their co- lour, as I shall state. More than a year would

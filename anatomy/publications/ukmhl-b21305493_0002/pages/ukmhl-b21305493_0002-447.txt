OF ORGANIC LIFE. 405 fectly similar. It matters not in what part they are examined, their varieties relate to the forms and not the texture. Here, on the contrary, the distinctions of texture are obvious ; the heart compared with the stomach, the intestines with the bladder, are striking1 examples. It is in vir- tue of these differences of the texture, that con- tractility and sensibility vary, as we shall see in each muscle, that the power of contraction is not the sameâ€”that life is different in each, whilst it is uniform in those of animal life. We shall, however, consider the organization of the invo- juntary muscles in a general point of view. SECTION i. Tissue proper to the Organization of the Muscular System of Organic Life. The muscular fibres of organic life are, in ge- neral, much finer than those of the preceding sys- tem ; nor are they united in such large masses. Of a deep red in the heart, they are found whi- tish in the gastric and urinary organs. This hue besides varies in an astonishing degree. I have sometimes observed those of the intestines acquire a very deep brown by maceration. These fibres are never found, like the preced- ing, to assume only one direction : they are con- stantly intermixed, or are laid in juxta-position, in different ways. Sometimes they form rectan-

342 MUSCULAR SYSTEM be conceived why animal contractility may or may not be submitted to the influence of the will. In both cases the series of phenomena it necessi- tates is invariably the same; there is always an excitement of the brain, transmission by the nerves, and action of the muscles, or a successive inaction of these three organs. The difference rests in the cause only by which the cerebral ex- citation is produced. Now this cause may be ; 1st. The will; 2dly. Any irritation immediately applied; 3d!y. A sympathetic irritation. It is very important to form a precise and correct idea of this vital power, which acts so essential a part in the living economy. \ Continuance of Animal Contractility after Death. The difference of causes that in animal contrac- tility act upon the brain to induce this organ to excite the muscles, is very obviously displayed at the moment of death. In whatever manner it is brought into action, the intellectual functions are always the first to cease, and it is to this we refer the idea of the absence of life. Hence it follows, that the very first phenomenon produced by this absence must necessarily be a deficiency of mus- cular contraction submitted to the influence of the will, which is the result of these intellectual functions. Every thing then in the muscular sys- tem remains in a passive state, if no cause acts upon the brain or upon the nerves; but these

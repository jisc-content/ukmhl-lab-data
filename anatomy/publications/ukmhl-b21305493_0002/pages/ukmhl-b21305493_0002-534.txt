MUCOUS SYSTEM. 492 difference between the two, the one being in a dis- eased and the other in a healthy state. It is also observed, that irritation in any part of one of these membranes frequently causes pain in another point of the same membrane that has not been irritated. Thus a stone in the blad- der causes pain at the extremity of the glands; the presence of worms in the intestines produces itching in the nose, &c. &c. Now these phe- nomena are merely sympathetic, for the partial irritation of either of these membranes will affect any part of the other: there are, however, in- stances of it; such as the singular consent ex- isting in mucous discharges, between the mem- brane of the uterus and that of the bronchia. If, during the periodical discharge, the blood acci- dentally ceases to flow from the one, this fluid is often exhaled from the other, which acts as a sub- stitute, as it were, for the former. From inspection and observation, we ought then to consider the mucous surface in general as being formed by two large membranes distributed over several organs, communicating together by the skin only, which is placed between them, and which being continued with both, contributes to form a general membrane every where continued, covering the animal externally, and extended within over its more essential parts. It will be easily conceived, that there must exist an import- ant connection between the interior and exterior

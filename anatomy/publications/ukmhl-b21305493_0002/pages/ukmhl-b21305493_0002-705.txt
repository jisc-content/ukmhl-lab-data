GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 663 are thus secured from mechanical injury. The greater part occupy such parts as habitually per- form repeated motion ; such are, the salivary, near the jaws; the mucous, adjacent to the fleshy layer, the liver, near the diaphragm, <&c. This is what led to a belief that this motion was intended to assist the excretion of their fluids. But, 1st. The glands of the velum palati, the pancreas, the testis, the kidneys, could hardly, even on account of their respective situations, borrow the least auxiliary assistance ; 2ndly. We know the mouth waters, according to the vulgar expression, at the sight of a savoury dish ; 3rdly. The sialago- gues produce a similar effect; 4thly. When the bladder is paralyzed, the mucous juices flow as before, frequently even more abundantly ; 5thly. Semen is emitted involuntarily ; 6thly. The ex- cretion of the mucous juices is as easily effected in the pituitary membrane, as any where else, although the fleshy layer, nearly every where ex- tended under the mucous system, is absolutely wanting here, &c. &c. A multiplicity of similar facts prove this truth, elucidated by Bordeu, namely, that vital action is the essential cause of every excretion. Auxiliary means, however, ought not to be entirely rejected. In fact, in cases of salivary fistula, the patient evidently emits more fluid dur- ing mastication than at any other time. It is evident that the abdominal muscles act the most

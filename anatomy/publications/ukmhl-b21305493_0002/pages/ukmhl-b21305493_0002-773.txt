731 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. of the glandular system being more considerable during winter, must also be referred the fre- quency of catarrhs, the greater number of which proclaim an unnatural increase of its action, and the greater facility with which the kidneys admit of being influenced by cantharides, &c. in that season. In the treatment of diseases, physicians ought never to lose sight of these considerations. The glandular system should be more acted upon during winter, and the cutaneous during summer, because each system is so much the better disposed to answer the stimulants directed to it as its function is certainly increased. Fifth Character.â€”Influence of the Sex upon the Glands. ' Is the life of the glandular system more active in the male than in the female sex ? In respect to the glands intended for digestion, secretion of tears, evacuation of urine, &c. little difference is observable between the two sexes. In what re- lates to the general glands, man has, in addition to his share, the testes and prostate gland, the female the breast; so that there is a mutual ba- lance. It should be remarked, however, that the influence of the former upon the economy is much superior to that of the latter. From the womb proceeds that sympathetic influence which corresponds to that from the testes in every other organ of man.

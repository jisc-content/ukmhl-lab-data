46 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. In regard to their cellular tissue, it appears almost completely different: it might even be said, that in whatever part the compact fibres or those of the cancelli are ruptured, the fila- ments are never distinct; it is their tight and dense tissue that conceals them from us. In fact, 1st. Whenever that texture softens, and the bone becomes fleshy, as it is vulgarly termed, the cellular tissue is very apparent. 2dly. Gran- ulations formed over the fractured parts, or over those laid bare, are nothing more than an extension of the cellular tissue, overloaded with calcareous substance, that in the natural state concealed them from sight. 3dly. After having deprived a fresh bone of all this substance, by means of an acid, I have sometimes discerned the cellular filaments, by separating the cartilagi- nous fibres that constitute the remaining paren- chyma. 4thly. When to extract from it the gelatine, this cartilaginous parenchyma is submit- ted to ebullition, parts of membranes are left, that are evidentlv cellular. â€¢/ The nerves cannot be traced in bones, such is the tenuity of the filaments that penetrate these organs. I am not aware that anatomy has any thing positive in this respect.

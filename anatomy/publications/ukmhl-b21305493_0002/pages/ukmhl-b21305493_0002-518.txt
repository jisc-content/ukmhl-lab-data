476 MUSCULAR SYSTEM The sensible organic contractility of the heart in the foetus and in the early age, has, however, been too much exaggerated, undoubtedly on ac- count of the excessive rapidity of circulation at that stage. This rapidity proceeds as much from the activity of the tonic powers of the general capillary system, as from that of the heart; be- cause, as we have remarked, when once the blood has reached the general capillary system, this fluid is no longer under the influence of the heart, and its continuance in that system depends en- tirely upon the power of the system itself. Now at that period very active, these powers accelerate the course of the blood, and propel it into the veinous system, from which it reaches the heart; the irritability of which is then doubled, or even trebled. If the blood reached it but slowly, it could not possibly keep up a rapid and at the same time a continued pulse. Haller has suffered himself to be misled in this respect, by supposing that the heart was the sole impulsive agent of the blood circulating, even in the most minute ves- sels : besides, the sensible organic contractility of the heart is not in the foetus very easily brought into action by our experiments, and its duration is much shorter. Then the strongest stimulants have less power over it immediately after death, than the weakest have over the heart of an animal that has breathed. I have repeatedly verified this in the fetuses of guinea pigs. Compared with that of

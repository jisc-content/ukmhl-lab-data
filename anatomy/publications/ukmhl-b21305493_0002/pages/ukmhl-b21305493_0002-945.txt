903 E PI DERMOID A L SYSTEM. but the slightest inspection will be sufficient to convince that here, as in the skin, it only forms a superficial covering to the papillae and corium. Removed by boiling water from the palate, tongue, pharynx, it even leaves the two other layers exposed. SECTION I. Epidermis at the origin of the Mucous Surfaces. At the divers origins of the mucous surfaces the epidermis is remarkably distinct, as on the glands, in the openings of the arms, urethra, fossae nasales, mouth, &c. Its presence in those parts is proved by the excoriations that occur, particularly in the lips; by dissection with a very thin lancet; by the action of boiling water, maceration, putrefaction, and even by the epispastics, as is exemplified in the mode used by the ancients, who used this means for the operation of the hare-lip. This epidermis is much thinner than that of the skin, and the more so the further it proceeds. To this circumstance must be attributed the facility with which divers remarkable modifications are pro- duced through this membrane, when, for the gal- vanizing process, the surface of the tongue is loaded with zinc, the mucous surface of the tunica conjunctiva with another metal, that of the pitui- tary membrane, of the surface of the rectum, of the gums, See., and that these divers metals are brought directly or indirectly into contact.

OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 19 peculiar apophyses of muscular implantation, of the styloid, for instance, and the power of the muscles to which they give rise, &c. The eminences for the insertion of ligaments afford the advantage, by removing in some degree the lio-ament from the articulation, of facilitating the motions of the latter. This is particularly re- markable in respect to the lateral ligaments of the elbow, of the knee, &c. In regard to the eminences of insertion, their respective functions will hardly admit of being viewed in a general light. 3d. The eminences of reflexion, are those un- der which, by deviating from its primitive course, a tendon passes. Such is the curve of the ptery- goid apophysis, the malleolar head of the fibula, &c. Nearly all these eminences present in one sense a hollow or excavation, completed in the other sense by a ligament, and thus constitute a ring for the transmission of the tendon. 4th. The eminences of impression it is said, are those that exist where the different organs form depressions that are divided by the emi- nences on the ossified surfaces, which are nothing more than the bone preserving in this part its natural level. The cerebral and muscular impres- sions are produced as instances of this disposition ; but are these impressions actually the result of the compression of the organs on the bone, or do they depend upon the laws of ossification, laws c 2

Denser and thicker, the other resists without being ruptured, every effort imparted to the abdominal viscera. It may be drawn out without danger, and its texture is quite different. 2dly.

Should we be surprised then, if all the serous surfaces are not equally liable to the same dis- eases; if their inflammation presents varieties; if ten are ascertained in the pleura, to one in the tu- nica arachnoides; if they are not attended with the same symptoms in the pericardium, the tunica vaginalis, and the peritoneum; if dropsies vary k

OSSEOUS SYSTEM. m basis always remains; the fibres of the tendon above the sesamoid bone are continued, as it were, through its substance, with the inferior ones, thus cicatrization in these bones, when frac- tured, displays a peculiar and distinctive charac- ter ; it is their fibrous bases, by extending to effect the re-union, that establishes this differ- ence. We are perfectly aware that the callus in the patella is not the same as in other bones. Frequently, when the dressings have not been properly secured, a fibro-cartilaginous tissue re- mains between the two fragments as a uniting medium; this tissue then is formed, not only of the cartilaginous part of the bone, but also of a portion of the tendon of the extensors that con- tribute to the organization of this bone. The vi- tality of the sesamoid organs partake nearly as much of the fibrous as of that of the bony system. In proportion as age advances, these small bones grow, and become more characterized in the animal economy; some even are formed at a late period, at twenty, thirty, and even forty years of age. In some aged subjects, they acquire in the foot rather a considerable volume. In the dead bodies of two gouty subjects, I have found they were so large as probably to have obstructed progression. Are these organs in any way con- nected with this painful affection ? In this respect I can produce nothing, except the above facts. The sesamoid bones remove their tendons from

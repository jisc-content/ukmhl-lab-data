The sensations of weariness, of dull pains, that of heaviness, the draggings felt in the limbs at the commencement of many diseases, are nothing more than sympa- thetic phenomena, in which this property is excited in the muscles. These sympathetic dis- turbances are also very remarkable at the ter- mination of several other affections, but in gene- ral less so than at the commencement. In the species of muscles now under considera- tion, the organic properties are seldom seen to act sympathetically ; however, if they do act, we cannot judge of them, since they are not demon- strable. Perspiration in the skin, the secreted fluids in the glands, the fluids exhaled over a num- ber of surfaces, are general results which proclaim sympathetic derangement of organic sensibility, and insensible organic contractility. In muscles we are denied these means of ascertaining such alterations. Characters of the Vital Properties. From all that has been hitherto stated respect- ing the muscular properties and sympathies, it will easily be conceived that vital activity must in general be more developed in muscles than in any other organ that has yet been examined in this volume ; consequently all their affections be- gm to resume a peculiar character which makes A A 2

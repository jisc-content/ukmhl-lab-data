SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 051 under the flexors, <&c., fulfil in regard to these muscles, the same functions as the tendinous syno- vial bags. They are to their respective tendons, what the cellular bag is to those of the psoas, and of the iliac, on separating them from the crural arch. The most important use of the membrane we are now considering relates to synovia. It is ex- haled from this membrane through a multiplicity of orifices, which, after remaining a short time on these surfaces, is returned by absorption into the circulation. Its parieties are then the seat of exhalation, as the kidnies, for instance, are the focus of secretion of urine. The reservoir for the exhaled fluid-is the imperforated sac it forms, as the bladder is for urine that flows from the or- gans that secrete it. The excretory tubes of this fluid are the absorbents that return it to the mass of the blood, as the urethra outwardly rejects urine from the bladder. In these respects there is much more analogy between secretion and exhalation than would at first be supposed. The effects arising from the continuation of the synovia in its membranous reservoir relate to itself, or to the articular surfaces. The first con- sist in a particular alteration it undergoes before it is absorbed, and of which we are ignorant. The second facilitate the motions of the joints. The unctuous and slippery fluid which these surfaces

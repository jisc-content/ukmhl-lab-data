76 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. SECTION III. Considerations on the Immoveable Articulations. In this class, we have been restricted to orders, because its varieties are not sufficiently extended to be subdivided into genera. 1st. The order of immoveable articulations with surfaces in juxta-position, is met with in such parts, as those where the single mechanism of the part nearly suffices to insure the solidity of the bones, that are merely situate next to each other, without being bound by the least insertion, and are only separated by an interposed small layer of cartilage. Thus the maxillary bones that are in- serted between the cheek bones, the os unguis, the ethmoidal, the palatine, the vomer, the coronal, &c. are supported more by the general mecha- nism of the face than by the articulating ties that connect them together: thus the squamous portion of the temporal bone supports the parietal more by the mechanical powers of its angles, than by the mode of union of their respective surfaces. Deprive the parts of this general mechanism, and they instantly separate. 2d. The order of immoveable articulations, with inserted surfaces, is also partly indebted for its solidity to the general structure of the region ;

75 OSS LOUS SYSTEM. clavicle anterior ends of the ribs, and upper end of the fibula. There is but one sort of gliding, more or less obscure, and in which the bony sur- faces are rarely separated ; almost every one of these surfaces are plain, very tightly compressed together, united by innumerable ligaments, and so effectually supported in their connections, that they can hardly ever admit of luxation. Another cause also prevents these accidents, it is that nearly the whole of these articulations belong to the short bones: now, it is sufficiently known, that the motion imparted to a bone has a power of action, that is in a direct sense with its length, and in a reverse one with its smallness; for in- stance, the same power applied to the tibial end of the femur will much sooner cause the luxation of its ischiatic end, than if applied to the middle of that bone. As the isolated motion of every individual articulation of the fifth genus is excessively re- stricted, nature generally accumulates several in the same part, to produce a sensible general mo- tion, as in the carpus, the tarsus, in the ver- tebrae, &c.: this is an additional cause for the scarcity of luxations in these kinds of articula- tions. In fact, let the general motions be ever so violent, two bones separately taken, perform but very little motion in respect to each other, and it is only the extent of motion in isolated bones, that can produce displacement.

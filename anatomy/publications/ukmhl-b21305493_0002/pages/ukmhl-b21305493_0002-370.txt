MUSCULAR SYSTEM 328 plains why the luxations of the first vertebrae over the second are attended with sudden death, whenever the displacement is very considerable; why experienced practitioners will not some- times run the chance of reduction when they are incomplete, for fear of completing them, and destroying the patient they wish to save ; why again, on knocking clown an animal, the blow is constantly directed to the upper and back part of the spine ; why a knife thrust between the first and second vertebrae causes instant death, &c. The successive influence of the different parts of the spinal marrow over the muscles and gene- ral life, will be perfectly elucidated by passing a long wire into the inferior part of the vertebral canal of any animal, of a guinea pig for instance, and by extending it up to the cranium through the spinal marrow, which is lacerated by it. In proportion as the wire ascends, convulsions in the inferior limbs are first observed, then in the abdominal muscles, afterwards respiration is dis- turbed, then it ceases, and finally death is the result. From all these facts, the influence of the spinal marrow upon motion, the principal of which it receives from the brain, and subsequently trans- mits to the nerves, cannot, I think, be doubted. These transmit to the muscle that principal they have received, either through the intervention of the marrow', as in almost all those of the trunk,

26 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. pact. Authors have admitted of a third,â€”the recticular, but it is included in the former. Cellular Tissue. In the first periods of ossification, the cellular portion does not exist. The time of its forma- tion is when the calcareous phosphate is added to the gelatine of the primitive cartilage, and the organ assumes a bony nature. Then the solid mass of the cartilage is divided into innumerable cellulse, because the gelatine being taken up by the absorbents, has left the parts it previously occupied. It is no longer replaced by the exhal- ants that still circulate some, and which begin to convey the calcareous phosphates to the fibres, from the interweaving of which these cellulse proceed ; so that the developement of the can- celli is visibly owing to the disproportion arising in bones, at a certain epoch of their increase, be- tween the functions of the exhalants and absorb- ents, hitherto equally maintained. The cause of this disproportion is not ascertained; it appears to be a law of ossification ; it is in virtue of this law, and by a similar mechanism, that the ethmoid bone, solid at first, and full as long as its original cartilage, is filled with numerous cellulse, at the epoch of its ossification. Thus it is the sphenoid and frontal sinuses originate and are extended.

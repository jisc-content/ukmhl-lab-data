773 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. small vesicles or phlyctaenee, which instantly form on its surface, and contain a serous fluid that flows the moment these vesicles are opened. Papillce. By the papillae are meant small projections which rise upon the surface of the corium, and which perforatingâ€™ the capillary net we have just noticed, become by their extremities contiguous to the epidermis ; these projections are very strik- ing in the palm of the hand and in the sole of the foot, where they assume a regular arrange- ment in the form of small curved striae following different directions. They appear through the epidermis thick, as it is in those parts; but are particularly striking whenever this has been re- moved either by maceration or ebullition, &c.; on dividing longitudinally a piece of the corium of the foot, adhering to its epidermis, between these two, and all along the divided edge, a line de- scribing a twining thread is observed, resulting from the minute projections situate next to each other. In several other parts of the skin the papillae are rather obvious, but in many parts, on remov- ing the epidermis, nothing more than a surface, made uneven by a few small prominences, is ob- served, particularly towards the orifices crossed by the hair and vessels ; this is not possessed of

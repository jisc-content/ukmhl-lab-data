741 glandular system. I have remarked, that the muscular and glandular systems are in a reverse order to digestion, at least in that state to which we reduce them for our meals. The glandular system, in fact, is savoury, and easy of digestion, in young animals only, whilst at that age the muscle is flat, and does not become palatable food until towards the middle stage of life. The colour of the glands undergoes less change from excessive age than that of the major part of other organs. The liver, the kidneys, &c. are found to contain nearly as much blood as in the adult; they are quite as red ; whilst pale and dis- coloured, the muscles prove by their hue how scantily they are supplied with blood. We might be led to conclude that this fluid first forsakes the skin and the muscles of animal life which in the trunk lay subjacent to it, and which in the limbs are far distanced from the heart, or at least that it is considerably diminished in the two sys- tems, and concentrated in the organs nearer to the heart. Thus in the aged subject the secre- tions are still very abundant, whilst the muscular and nervous powers, &c. are considerably re- duced. The kidneys still secrete a quantity of urine, the liver still procures abundance of bile, although this organ has partly lost that kind of predominance it possessed in the prime of life. Catarrhs, remarkably frequent at that advanced age, as is well known, prove an increase of action

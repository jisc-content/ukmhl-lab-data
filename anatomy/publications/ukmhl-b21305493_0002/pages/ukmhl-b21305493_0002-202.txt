160 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. ous organs where it is found in a smaller propor- tion, and in the fibrous bodies that contain still less. We must acknowledge, however, that nu- merous bodies, essentially gelatinous, give but in- different signs of elasticity : the skin is an instance of this, and tendons also display a similar disposi- tion : how happens it that the same substance may, accordingly as it has been differently elaborated by the organic powers, become the seat of quite opposite properties ? section II. Properties of the Tissue. Cartilages are, perhaps, amongst all other organs, those in which the extensibility and con- tractility of the tissue are the least developed. They are veryseldom found to distend, to length- en, and they sooner part. Diseases do not dis- close to us, in the larynx, those dilatations so fre- quently met with in other cavities, even in those of a bony conformation. Far from separating, as in the skin, in a muscle, &c., the edges of their sections are drawn together, as we have seen, by the effects of elasticity : one might think this last property is accumulated therein, to the detriment of the tissue.

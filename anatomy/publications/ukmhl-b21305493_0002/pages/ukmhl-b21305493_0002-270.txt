228 FIBROUS SYSTEM* is formed, filled with cellular tissue, and strewed with vessels. I have sometimes distended this by injections through a small aperture made in- tentionally. The intimate union of the capsule with the synovial membrane prevents this last organ from folding, and therefore secures it from the contusions to which in extensive motions it might be exposed. SECTION II. Functions of the Fibrous Capsules. Why are the fibrous capsules exclusively met with around the first kind of articulations only ? The reason is very simple : as these articulations are calculated to perform in every direction mo- tions nearly equal, they also require an equal re- sistance, whilst the others intended only to be moved in two or three ways, ligaments were ne- cessary to limit these motions. This explains why, for instance, the fibrous system is distributed around the ilio-femoral articulations in the form of a membrane, and united in isolated parts round the femero-tibial articulation, where the synovial membrane is nearly every where left bare. From all that has just been stated, it will be easily conceived that the fibrous capsules are com- pletely limited to securing the articulating con- nections, and that this use is evidently uncon- nected with synovial exhalation.

It is not without reason, that the bone is left in boiled meats; besides the white organs that surround it, and the medullary oil it contains, it imparts to the liquid a substance peculiar to itself. 3dly. The combustion of bones, and particularly of their cartilaginous residue, has exactly the same smell as that produced by the combustion of every ani- mal glue, which, as is well known, are especially composed of gelatine. 4thly. In the different affec- tions that soften the bones,, the earthy substance is evidently more or less diminished, and the ge- latine remains proportionally more abundant than before. These two substances, the gelatine and the saline, that are the essential component parts of bones, give to these organs very distinct charac- ters. The calcareous phosphate nearly uncon- nected with life, is merely intended to provide the bones with the degree of solidity and resis- tance that characterize them. The gelatinous substance, on the contrary, has especially the characteristic of animal matter; thus is animal activity, as we shall see in a reverse sense with the one, and in a direct one with the other. When deprived of the second, bones will no longer admit of being digested, the gastric fluids will not act upon them, they cannot ex-

FIBROUS S VST EM. €07 o-ans. In a foetus of seven months, a few white threads begin to be perceived in an insensible manner,—very scarce at first, and separate from each other, they draw nearer subsequent to birth, and assume a parallel disposition, or interweave in various directions, according to the organ which they wholly invade, at a certain age, if I may be allowed the expression. These observations are more easily made in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm, in the aponeurosis of the thigh, or the dura-mater. In proportion as the fibres are developed in the fibrous organs, they present more resistance and hardness. In the foetus, and in early life, they are exceedingly soft, and yield easily. Their colour is quite different from that they display at a more advanced age : it is a pearly whiteness ; it is only by degrees they acquire that degree of strength which especially characterizes their tissue. To this softness, to this deficiency of resistance of the fibrous system in early life, the follow- ing phenomena must be attributed :—1st. The articulations at that age admit of motions, that, from the rigidity of the ligaments, are subse- quently impossible. Every extension may then be forced beyond its natural degree. It is suffi- ciently known, this is the time when what are called tumblers begin to exercise; they could never succeed in performing those extraordinary

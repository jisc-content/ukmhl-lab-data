157 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. conjunctiva is inflamed, &c. As soon as the cause of irritation has subsided, sensibility is restored to its natural type, and on that account the red glo- bules become heterogeneous substances with re- spect to the cartilages, which re-assume their na- tural whiteness. The nature of the white fluids that are com- monly circulated by the vascular system of the cartilages is not ascertained. These fluids have a strong tendency to become the vehicle for the propagation of bile, at least for the colouring substance of that fluid, when, as in jaundice, it is diffused throughout the animal economy. In this disease the cartilages, like all other parts, are al- most invariably found tinged with yellow; this colour is more striking on their surfaces than in their tissue, although it is very conspicuous there. On opening a moveable articulation, the appear- ance is generally as striking as on the skin; be- sides, all parts which, like these in the natural state, receive but few red globules, or none at all, are also very evidently tinged. The tendons, the tunica conjunctiva, the internal membrane of the arteries, are instances of this. In two different subjects in whom the middle part of the thyroid cartilages were ossified, I have observed that the yellow colour was much deeper in the ossified than in the cartilaginous part. I am not aware that nerves have been traced in the cartilages.

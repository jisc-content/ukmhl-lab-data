Thus in nearly every instance of this monstrosity quoted by authors, by Haller in particular, these subjects have died immediately after birth. Animal Contractility considered in the Nerves. Distant from almost every muscle, the brain communicates with and transmits its influence by means of the nervous system. Now these com- munications are effected in two different ways; 1st.

DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 75? pendicular direction, but all of them obliquely on its surface ; so that a perpendicular pressure tends to make them collapse, by bringing their parietes together. Their termination cannot be better compared than with that of the ureters in the bladder. This explains why the hair it is crossed by is never straight, but in an oblique direction with the skin. It is wrong to say the hair is inserted obliquely, its insertion in the bulb is straight, it is in crossing the corium that its direction is changed. These apertures are not vessels, they are merely communications from the interior to the exterior, crossed by the hair, the exhalents, the absorbents, the blood vessels, and the nerves, resorting to the surface of the dermis: in the same manner the sub- jacent areolae are nothing more than cellulae, con- taining the vessels of the glands and of the cellular tissue. The tissue of the dermis should then be con- ceived as a real net, as a kind of cellular tissue, in which the cellulae, considerably developed on the internal surface, are less so on the external with which they communicate, to transmit to it diffe- rent organs. The corium then is, if I may be al- lowed to express myself thus, the frame, the can- vas of the cutaneous organ. It is intended to harbour in its areolae every other part which con- tributes to the structure of that organ ; it also concurs in giving them their intended form, but is wholly unconnected with them. What is the nature of this areolar tissue, which

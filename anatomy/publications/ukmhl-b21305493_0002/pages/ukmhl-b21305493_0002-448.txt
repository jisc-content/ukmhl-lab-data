406 MUSCULAR SYSTEM gles in the skains, as the longitudinal and circular fibres in the gastric tubes; at other times, as in the stomach, bladder, &c. they form angles more or less acute. In the heart this interweav- ing is such, as to form in the ventricles a com- plete muscular net. From these various direc- tions there results real advantage for the motions of these kind of organs, which, being hollow, may lessen, by contracting into various diameters the extent of their cavity. All the organic muscular fibres are generally rather short; those which like the longitudinal ones of the oesophagus, of the rectum, &c. seem to run a considerable distance, and are not conti- nuous ; they originate and terminate in a short space, to arise and terminate again in the same line : in respect to length, none can be compared with those of the sartorius, of the gracilis, &c. We are not better acquainted with their nature than with that of the fibres of animal life ; they act besides nearly the same when submitted to the divers re-agents. The very same phenomena are produced by desiccation, putrefaction, maceration, and ebullition. I have remarked, in respect to the latter, that after having undergone ebullition, the fibres of both systems are not so readily af- fected by acids sufficiently diluted. After having remained for some length of time in the sulphu- ric, the muriatic, and the nitric acids, diluted with water, they become somewhat softer, but retain

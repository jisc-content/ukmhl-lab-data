954 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. to that epoch. I have remarked that the hair of the head, the eyebrows, eyelids, and the hair round the orifices, are the least affected by this revolution. This increase besides, is effected gra- dually : the beard requires two or three years to attain its perfect and permanent state. In the subsequent stages, this system undergoes but very little change, the hair grows again as soon as it is cut, and is therefore the seat of an habitual elaboration. It may be remarked that this elaboration, and consequently the growth of hair, is more rapid in summer, when the cutaneous organ is particularly active; an additional proof of the actual vitality of the organic powers of the internal substance of hair. / 4 SECTION III. State of this System in Old Age. Towards the decline of life, the system of the hair feels the influence of the general obliteration that occurs in almost all the exterior vessels: it first ceases to be supplied with the colouring substance. The internal substance dies, and the external part only remains \ the hair of the head turns white ; that of the beard, and upon the genital organs, dies in turn. Besides, in man, this admits of innumerable varieties : in some men this phenomenon begins at the age of thirty, and even before ; in others at forty, fifty, or sixty.

602 SEROUS SYSTEM. be compared with such as have been observed to operate upon the cellular system, we shall find them to be perfectly the same ; consequently that these two systems are analogous, nay identical. On putrefying in the air, the serous system does not, like the skin, assume a green aspect, it becomes tarnished, and of a very deep grey ; during life, on the contrary, its black hue is very obvious in gangrene, resulting, sometimes, from acute inflammation, at other times from those chronic inflammations, attended with a rash of small whitish tubercles, so frequently observed over these membranes. This difference proceeds from these surfaces not being in the corpse per- meated with blood at the moment they are in- vaded by putrescency, whilst they contain a quantity of this fluid in the living subject when putrescency is a consequence of the inflammation by which the exhalents have been filled. A number of other facts, besides, have proved that the more the blood contained in a part when vaded by putrescency, the more that part will become livid and black. In the numerous sub- jects I have already opened, I have only observed gangrene in the peritoneum; I have never met with it in the pleura, the tunica arachnoides, the pericardium, and the tunica vaginalis testis. These are no doubt liable to gangrene ; but I have, I believe, opened a sufficient number of subjects,

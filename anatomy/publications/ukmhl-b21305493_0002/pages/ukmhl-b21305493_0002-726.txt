GLANDULAR SYSTEM. G84 powers are particularly inherent, are especially affected in diseases ; but why should not fluids be so likewise ? why should we not seek for morbid causes as well in these as in the solids ? There are cases in which these are primitively affected, and the fluids subsequently only : thus, in cancer, in affections of the liver, of the spleen, &c. in the greatest number of organic injuries, the divers shades of yellow, grey, brown, even green, &c. invading the face, proclaim the alterations which the fluids have undergone in their hue, and consequently in their nature. In other cases the affection originates from the fluids ; as when the venom of a viper is communi- cated to the blood, as in re-absorptions of the pus from exterior collections, of that which is the focus of consumption, as in the absorption of the different contagious principles. It cannot be doubted that the different substances which may be introduced with the chyle, into the mass of the blood, are the cause of a number of diseases. Is it not the blood that conveys to the brain the narcotic principles which bring on sleep ? is it not by this same fluid turpentine and cantharides are conveyed to the kidneys, and mercury to the glands, &c. ? If opium or wine be injected into the veins, the animal will be lulled to sleep, as if the dose had been taken into the stomach. At one time it was much in use to inject the veins of living animals with medicated infusions.

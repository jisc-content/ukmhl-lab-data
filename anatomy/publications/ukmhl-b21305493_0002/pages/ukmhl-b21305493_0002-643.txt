SEROUS SYSTEM. 601 ation without the utmost difficulty. In my experiments, the slightest, the thinnest of these membranes, that of the spleen, has resisted it for a considerable length of time. This phenomenon is particularly striking when compared with the maceration of tendonsthatare so very resistant,and which during life bear such considerable strains. These have already been reduced by water into a pulp, when the epiploon is still left unaffected. The other serous membranes possess a similar property. 4thly. As the fibrous system, these surfaces shrink in hot water, but they yield much less gelatine ; like this they do not turn yellow. The pleura with the parts of the breast of ani- mals brought on our tables nearly retains its usual appearance ; it is only rather more tarnished, has been stript of the power of shrinking under the action of caloric, and can no longer be acted upon in the same manner by acids, &c. Had this membrane been of a fibrous nature, it would, on account of its tenuitv, have been diffused into gelatine, and the same may be said of the external membranes of the spleen, of the liver, of the lungs, dressed for our meals. Let us only com- pare on our tables the boiled meats, the intermus- cular aponeurosis, tendons, &c. and we shall find it is impossible to confound all the white tissues together as the chymists have done. If the different effects from the action of agents we are more familiar with upon the serous system

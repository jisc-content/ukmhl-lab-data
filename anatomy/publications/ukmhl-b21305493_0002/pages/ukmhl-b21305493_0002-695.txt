SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 053 Accidental Dev elopement, I have already sfated in the chapter on the fibrous capsules, that whenever the head of a bone has been left displaced, the membrane that formed round this head is not similar to the ori- ginal one; it is a real cyst, smooth in its internal surface, moistened with serum, formed at the ex- pence of the cellular tissue, and presenting com- pletely, though leather thicker, the appearance of the synovial membrane. The motions imparted to a dislocated limb appear to increase the serous exhalation in this newly-formed membrane : hence, undoubtedly, the great advantage resulting from these motions, to assist in the reduction. I have observed in a dancer, that the head of the humerus, which had fixed itself in the armpit, still performed a variety of motions, ARTICLE II. Synovial System of the Tendons. This system, noticed by several authors, de- scribed by Fourcroy, Soemmering, and others, is absolutely of the same nature as the preceding, dif- fering only in situation. Thus is the synovial mem- brane of the tendon of the biceps continuous with that of the scapulo-humeral articulation : thus are those of the jemeili, with the synovial organ of

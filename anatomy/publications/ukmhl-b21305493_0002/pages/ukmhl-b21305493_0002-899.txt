The more the cutaneous sensibility has'been excited, the sounder the sleep ; hence all painful stimulants, strong frictions, &c. are always followed by sound sleep. This sense, however, is sometimes exercised whilst the others are at rest: if the leg of a man be pinched during his sleep, he will draw it without up awaking, and retains not the slightest remembrance of the sen- sation. Thus, those subject to somnambulism, hear, and even will eat, &c.; for as I have already stated, sleep may suppress the animal sensibility of one part only, or of the whole body. In respect to organic sensibility, the vitality of the cutaneous system is essentially continuous; thus, the functions over which this property pre- sides, are quite the reverse of the preceding. In- sensible perspiration is uninterruptedly continued, though more effectually at one time than at an- other. The oily substance is incessantly removed and renewed; it might even occasionally be sup- posed, that whenever the animal sensibility of the skin is suppressed, its organic sensibility is more active. In diseases particularly, this observation, which might also be generally applied to organic life, is obviously striking. This species of vitality is quite as active by night as by day, if not more so. Most of the diseases that vitiate the functions from organic life, acquire additional activity during

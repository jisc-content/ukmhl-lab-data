DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 762 now on this external surface are found, 1st. What is called the rete mucosum ; 2dly. The papillae. Of the Rete Mucosum. A great number of authors have represented to themselves the rete mucosum as a kind of tunic applied to the external surface of the skin, between the corium and epidermis, containing an infinitude of apertures through which the papillae make their way. I cannot possibly conceive, for my part, how this fluid layer, according to the greatest number, when removed from the epider- mis, could be demonstrated. To see it, I have used a variety of means, but none succeeded. 1st. Such is the attachment of the epidermis with the skin, that in its uninjured state they can hardly be se- parated without injury to either: however, if effected with the utmost care and precaution, nothing of a mucous nature is seen on the de- nuded corium; 2dly. When longitudinally di- vided, particularly in the foot, where the corium is very thick, the limits that separate it from the latter are easily seen in the divided edge of a part of the skin, but nothing transudes from this di- viding line ; 3dly. When the epidermis is re- moved by boiling, nothing is left upon the inter- nal surface, nor upon the corium ; 4thly.

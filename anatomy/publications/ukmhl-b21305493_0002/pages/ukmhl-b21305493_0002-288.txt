FIBROUS SYSTEM. â€˜246 tion: when the tendons are suddenly immersed in boiling water, they become thicker and more apparent in that part where the tendon has been transversely divided. In those parts where they expand to form an aponeurosis to unite with the periosteum, these fibres were distinctly seen with- out any kind of preparation. On the other hand, as a tendon softened and relaxed by maceration, will in this state admit of being converted into an artificial aponeurosis, or will assume any form whatever, maceration must necessarily be a very effectual method of obtaining a proper investiga- tion of the tendinous fibres. In this experiment, so easily repeated, I have never observed that spiral form in the tendinous cylinders of which some modern authors have spoken. These fibres are similarly arranged in a tendon, as they are wherever they separate from it, to form an apo- neurosis, that is to say, in a straight line. Scarcely any blood reaches the vascular system of tendons; but in certain inflammations they are completely permeated with this fluid. I have seen one of those of the extensors laid bare in a whitlow by a country surgeon, so completely red, that it had the appearance of a phlegmon. I have remarked, however, that this hue did not, as in several other organs undergoing inflammation, depend upon a number of small reddish streaks, in- dicating exhaling tubes filled with blood, but that the colour was uniform, resembling a substance

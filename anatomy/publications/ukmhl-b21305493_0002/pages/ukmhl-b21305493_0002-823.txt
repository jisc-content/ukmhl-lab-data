781 deumoidal system. that in such cases these organs may possess the faculty of assuming an independent temperature, they inflame, and by this means they constantly retain their degree of heat, let that of the sur- rounding air be what it may. Next to the skin, the mucous surfaces are the most capable of re- sisting temperature, as is proved in cases of pro- lapsus, ani, &c. This distinction of the different systems probably proceeds from that of their structure, 6thly. Whenever the degree of caloric is ex- cessive it begins to act upon the skin, and its effects are the more remarkable in proportion to its intensity; 1st. The least of its effects is an evident redness, a kind of erysipelas. Caloric in such cases operates like friction ; 2dly. The se- cond is to inflame the skin, and subsequently to produce blisters. The third actually produces contraction, a kind of wrinkling in the fibres of the corium, which shrink, as those of all animal tissues, on being exposed to a high degree of caloric ; 4thly. By the fourth and last effect the tissue of the dermis is burnt, blackened, and ac- tually reduced to charcoal. These different de- grees of burning, merely proceed from the equally different degrees of caloric. I have remarked, that in these two first effects this fluid only acts i upon the vital powers, consequently can be pro- duced during life only. The two latter on the contrary, merely operate upon the tissue of

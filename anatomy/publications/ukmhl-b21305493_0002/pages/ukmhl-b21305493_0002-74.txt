32 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. compact tissue differ from those of the muscles, in- asmuch as they are united together by frequent prolongations, whilst these are hardly possessed of any other means of union than the cellular organ, the vessels and nerves. Such is the inti- mate position of these fibres, that their inter- spaces are not discernible without the assistance of the glass, and which are filled with the medul- lary juice, and that of the vessels. In cases of rickets this identity is destroyed, and in the mid- dle of the long bones, under the increased layer of the periosteum, an ossified tissue of a circu- lar form, easily bent in every direction, display- ing an infinity of cellulse, and a substitute to the outward shell that should have existed, is observed. It appears that the change of this com- pact tissue is less the effect of absorption of a part of the calcareous phosphate, than of the extension of the bony fibres that separate from each other, and leave between them spaces that did not previously exist, giving to the long bone affected with this disease a very considerable thickness. I have repeatedly made this obser- vation. Disposition of the Two Bony Tissues, viewed in the Three Species of Bones. These tissues studied in the different species of bones are differently arranged. In general the

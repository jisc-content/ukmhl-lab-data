655 MUCOUS SYSTEM. uniform pulp. This uniformity in sensation na- turally commands nullity in perception, because to perceive, comparison is required, and here two terms of comparison are wanting. Thus the foetus is insensible to the liquor amnii: thus air, at first very irritating to the new-born child, ends by not being perceived. Excitants, on the con- trary, vary continually at the origins of the mu- cous membranes. We can perceive their presence, because we are enabled to compare their various modes of action. What I say is so perfectly true, that if in the depth of organs the mucous membranes come in contact with any substance they are accustomed to, it is instantly perceived. The sound in the bladder, the tubes introduced in the stomach, &c. are instances; the fresh air which through a very hot atmosphere instantly reaches the trachea, spreads over the whole surface of the bronchia a soothing and pleasing sensation ; but habit soon makes us insensible of the benefit, and its perception is soon lost. It should be ob- served, however, that whenever, in cases of the^ artificial anus, the intestines are forced outwardly, the sensibility of these organs is never so exquisite as that proper to the palate, the pituitary mem- brane, &c.: the deficiency of cerebral nerves un- doubtedly influences this phenomenon. In inflammations, the sensibility of the mucous system is considerably exalted ; how very painful acute catarrhs are, is sufficiently known. Contact

MEDULLA HY SYSTEM. 135 SECTION III. Properties. In the medullary organ, the properties of the tissue are strongly characterized. 1st, the spina-ventosa, by which this organ is stretched along with the body of the bone, in a very con- spicuous manner, clearly shows its extensibility. 2dly, the contractility of the tissue is proved by the collapse of the cellulee, subsequent to ampu- tation at the centre of a long bone ; this collapse prevents the effusion of the marrow, that, on ac- count of the existing communications between the cellulas, would otherwise be unavoidable. It is probable that insensible organic con- tractility being excited by the contact of air with this membrane, which shrinks by the irrita- tion, influences also this phenomenon ; for this mode of contractility, as well as the correspond- ing sensibility, are evidently within the attributes of this membrane. In its natural state, the animal sensibility is fully developed : the most agonizing pains proceed from the action of the saw in amputation, from the introduction of a stylet, of the injection of an irritating fluid in the medullary tube, or from any other means that may strongly excite it. I do not speak of the pains felt in bones in the spina-

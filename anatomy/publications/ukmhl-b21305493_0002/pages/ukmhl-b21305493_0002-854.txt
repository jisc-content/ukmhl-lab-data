DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 812 lations soon proved how far their authors had been deceived. If we but read these results we shall find that none agree, and that some- times very great differences exist amongst them. Should we wonder at it ?

The state of the constitution, exercise, rest, digestion, sleep, watching, passions, &c. will increase or diminish the action of the cutaneous exhalents. I am not speaking of the differences of climate, seasons, &c. which are still more effectual.

What opinion should we entertain of a man who should pretend at the equinoctial period, when the state of the atmosphere changes almost every instant, to ascertain the proportions between the quantity of rain that falls every fifteen minutes; or of him, who would attempt to establish connections be- tween the quantity of fluid evaporated at certain

We are but imperfectly acquainted with the manner in which bathing acts upon the cutaneous texture during life. In medical language it is said to relax, to soften, and render it pliant, vague expressions, uncalculated to convey any correct and precise ideas, and borrowed, no doubt, from the sudden softening the skin of a corpse (even tanned leather) undergoes on being immersed in water. Bathing operates upon the vital powers of the skin, it either rouses or diminishes them, as I shall explain, but it leaves its tissue in the same state, and, as we shall find, only changes that of the epidermis. Macerated in a moderate degree of tempera- ture, in that of cellars, for instance, which never varies, the human skin softens, hardly swells, be- comes evidently whiter, and remains a consider- able time in that state without undergoing any further alteration, except a degree of putrescency much inferior to that of the muscular, glandular, or the mucous tissues, &c. undergoing the same process. This degree of putrescency by which the epidermis is destroyed, is better observable on the side of this membrane ; after macerating for the space of two months, the skin has hardly lost any thing at all of its consistence. At this epoch reduced to a pulpy state similar to that of

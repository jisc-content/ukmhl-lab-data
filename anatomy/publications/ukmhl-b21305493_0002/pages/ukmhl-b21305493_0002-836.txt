794 DERM01DAL SYSTEM. / it were, a solid body: the fibres, for want of space, cannot so easily contract, they are left extended, and the surface remains wider. In the natural state, the spaces formed by the areolae being filled with cellular tissue, increase the width of the internal surface : these spaces having then disappeared, this surface necessarily becomes nar- rower. The moment this kind of tortion is effected in the skin, a multiplicity of phlyctaense, as I have said, filled with serum, and originating from the epidermis, form over it. This membrane being remarkably thick in the sole of the foot and palm of the hand, they cannot form in those parts, and nothing similar to phlyctsenae is ever detected. However, on removing it from boiled feet, I have observed it contained a number of 'small vesicles hardly discernible. I have not analyzed the water contained in the phlyctaense ; it must be similar, I conceive, to that drawn by blistering. A greater or less quantity also flows from these vesicles, which are consequently more or less spa- cious according to the state of the external capil- lary system at the moment of death. By shrinking the skin becomes harder, elastic remarkably resistant; thicker, and of course nar- rower, and soon after assumes a semi-transparent appearance and yellowish hue, like other fibrous organs that have been boiled. Then the hardness acquired by contracting gradually fades away; it

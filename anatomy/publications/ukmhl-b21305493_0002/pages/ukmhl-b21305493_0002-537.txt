495 MUCOUS SYSTEM. of Bauhinâ€™s valve. These folds are not only formed by the mucous membrane, but also by the interposed tunic we have mentioned, and which assumes in this part a remarkable thickness and density that insures their solidity. The fleshy tunic even enters into their composition, and their presence is known by an exterior depression over the serous surface. 2dly, Other folds, exclusively formed by the mucous surface, are also permanent, either in the state of plenitude or in that of vacuity, but less evidently than these; they proceed from the mu- cous surface being much more extensive than those over which they are applied ; so that it is folded to afford a more ample surface in the same space : such are the valvulae conniventes of the small intestines, the structure of which may be clearly ascertained, by dividing one of these or- gans in a longitudinal direction. The edges of the section show the fleshy layer and the serous surface straight in their courses, whilst the mu- cous layer describes a line not unlike a twining thread. 3dly. The third species of folds is accidental, as it were ; they are never observed but during the contraction of the organ, that is lined by the mucous surface in which they are formed; such are those of the interior of the stomach, of the 1 large intestines, &c. In the greatest number of subjects brought to our dissecting rooms, these '

MUCOUS SYSTEM. 558 1 \ the chest they differ from each other; sometimes presenting a yellowish hue, bilious as it were ; at other times leaving nothing but froth ; some- times remarkably viscid, or flowing readily from the vessel that contains them, fetid or inof- fensive in their smell. In the morning frequently grayish, whitish, greenish, or of a blackish ap- pearance, they display a variety of aspects, evi- dently denoting differences in their composition, differences which chemistry has not yet accounted for. I do not speak of those cases in which, as in phthisis, hemophysis, &c. foreign substances are mixed with these mucous juices. Now it is evident, that all these varieties depend solely upon varieties in the organic sensibility of the bronchial glands, or of the membrane over which these organs shed their fluids. Accordingly as this property is altered in the mucous system, this becomes connected with such and such sub- stances, selecting some, and rejecting others. The very same organ then, the very same vessel, may, according to the state of their vital powers, se- parate from the mass of blood a variety of sub- stances, reject some of them at one time, or se- lect them at another, &c. If further proofs of the changes which the various modifications ot the organic sensibility of the mucous membrane produce in their functions are required, let us re- gard the urethra ; in its ordinary state it opens a free passage to urine; when its powers are ex-

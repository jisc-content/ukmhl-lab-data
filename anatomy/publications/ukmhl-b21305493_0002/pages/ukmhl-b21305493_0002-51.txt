9 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. terior. Thus the external part of the tibia is evi- dently triangular, although inwardly its canal is of the same form as that of the femur. In general, those lines of insertion always separated from each other by plain surfaces, are three in number in every long bone, as is seen in the hu- merus, ulna, radius, tibia, the fibula, &c. I cannot account for this law of conformation. Another general observation is, that the body of nearly * every long bone is, as it were, twisted on its axis, in such a manner that the direction in the superior does not correspond with that of the inferior part. By following the lines I have just mentioned, from one end to the other, the truth of this remark, which however is more striking in the adult than in the foetus, is very apparent. This change of direction does not follow any general course. The interior forms of the long bones are per- fectly elucidated by sawing these organs in the longitudinal direction : their ends are filled with cellular tissue or cancelli, much thinner and less abundant in the middle where the medullary ca- nal is formed. During the first months of concep- tion, and as long as the bone is in a cartilaginous state, this canal does not exist in the foetus. It is formed during the process of ossification. At this epoch, all the gelatine contained in the mid- dle of the bone is then absorbed. Exhalation does not furnish this organ with any new sub-

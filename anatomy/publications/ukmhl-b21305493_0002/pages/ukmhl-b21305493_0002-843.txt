801 HER MO IDA L SYSTEM. I do not think that the cellular tissue of the corium extends under the epidermis as far as its external surface, for when this is removed granu- lations do not form; yet from all parts pos- sessed of cellular tissue granulations shoot the moment they are exposed. Blood-vessels. Arteries twine in the subcutaneous cellular tissue and project an infinitude of small branches, which penetrate with the cellular organ into the re- motest areolae of the dermis; subsequently they insinuate themselves into the adjacent cells, draw nearer to each other in twining, and anasto- mose in a thousand different ways, cross the areolae of the external surface of the corium, and finally give rise to that external capillary net which has been described in speaking of the rete mucosum, and wherein hardly any red blood is admitted, even in the natural state. In this track of the arteries through the areolee, the der- mis is supplied with a few branches only between the fibres of the corium, as is exemplified by the most minute injections. These fibres in this respect resemble those of the aponeurosis, that are intersected by a profusion of vessels, but can claim but few belonging to their tissue., The veins pursue nearly the same course as the arteries, but in a reverse sense. After crossing the areolee of the dermis and the cellular tissue 3 f VOL. II.

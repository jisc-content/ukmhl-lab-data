212 FIBKOUS SYSTEM. SECTION I. Forms of the Fibrous System. - * f • '■ • • * * * These kinds of membranes that compose, as I have said before, the periosteum, the dura-mater, the tunica sclerotica, the tunica albuginea, the membranes proper to the kidneys, to the spleen, to the corpora cavernosa, &c. are nearly all intended to form external coatings, tubes in which the or- gans they inclose are contained. These organs are not like those round which the serous surfaces are placed, as the stomach, the intestines, the bladder, the lungs, liable to al- ternate dilatations and contractions. This would not accord with their mode of extensibility; they are closely moulded upon the forms of these or- gans ; they show none of those numerous folds formed in the serous membranes, excepting, how- ever, in the dura-mater, they adhere by both sur- faces, a character that renders them essentially distinct from the preceding, as well as from the mucous membranes. One of these surfaces, intricately united with the organ, seems to project to it divers ex- tensors, which identify in a first glance its ex- istence with that of the membrane. Innumerable threads, projecting from the tunica albuginea, from the membrane of the cavernous bodies, from

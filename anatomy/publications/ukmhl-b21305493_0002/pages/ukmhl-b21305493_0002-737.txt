695 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. tissue is soon destroyed. This is most obvious when the collections form near the convex sur- face : if the tumour be at all voluminous, the tissue of the organ is destroyed, and nothing but a cel- lular and membranous cyst is left. We find in- stances of it in the hydatids so frequent in the exterior of the kidney. If the cyst be formed in the centre of the gland, the substance is also de- stroyed, but not so evidently. A striking proof that extensibility is very de- ficient in glands, is what is observed in regard to the liver in the corpse. I have previously stated that this organ is more or less gorged with blood, accordingly as the system of the dark circulation has been more or less obstructed at the time of death : but let the quantity of fluid it contains be what it may, its volume remains nearly the same, its tissue only is more or less compressed by the vessels ; whilst, on the contrary, the volume of the lungs, which is always very obvious,constantly shows its state of plenitude or of vacuity, so that the part the most exposed to injury, is that in which the hemorrhage is least to be dreaded. On reaching the gland, the principal artery soon di- vides into several branches, which separate and subdivide the more as they approach nearer the convex part. In their course they supply the body of the gland with a multiplicity of ramus- cuke, then terminate in innumerable capillary vessels over the convex surface. Frequently even

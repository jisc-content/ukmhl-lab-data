OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 69 The advantages derived from the great exten- sion which the circumduction of the superior limbs, intended for seizing external bodies, and from that motion, limited by nature in the infe- rior limbs intended for a stationary position arid locomotion only, are easily felt. Why the former are more easily luxated than the latter, is also easily understood. In fact, in one of the simple motions, a succession of which constitutes the compound motion of circumduction ; for instance, in elevation and depression, in adduction and ab- duction, &c. displacement most generally takes place, and all these motions being much more extended in the humerus than in the femur, the surfaces are more readily separated. Second Genus. The motion of rotation being wanting in this genus, it differs from the first. Opposition and circumduction only are met with. Instances of it are aseen in the temporo-maxillary articulations, in the sterno-clavicular, radio-carpal, metacarpo- phalangean, and in the carpo-metacarpal of the thumb, &c. The deficiency of rotation evidently implies, fiom what has been said, the absence of a bony head, whose axis should form, as in the preceding genus, an angle with the axis of the body of the one. Thus in every bone of the articulations to

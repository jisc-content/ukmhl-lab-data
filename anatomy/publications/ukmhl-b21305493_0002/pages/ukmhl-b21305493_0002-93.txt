OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 51 tact is attended with pain. Animal contrac- tility does not exist in this system. This, like every other system, is animated by the organic properties, and this kind of sensibility is very evident; bones feel the fluids they con- tain, and appropriate to themselves in virtue of that sensation, those accommodated to their nutri- tion. But do they re-act upon these fluids ? Are they calculated to perform those insensible osci- lations that constitute insensible organic contrac- tility ?â€”their state of hardness does not seem to admit of it. Within these organs there is a con- tinual alteration, an habitual composition and decomposition, that can hardly be conceived, without admitting of re-action on their part; on account of their structure, however, this re-action is performed more slowly, and with greater diffi- culty. Hence, undoubtedly, proceeds the degree of torpor, that will afterwards be noticed in the vital phenomena of this system. It is completely unconnected with sensible organic contractility. Characters of the Vital Properties. The vitality peculiar to bones consists only of organic sensibility and insensible organic con- tractility : from these two properties every vital phenomenon observed in these organs is derived ; inflammations, the formation of tumours, the cica- trization of their fractures, &c. This peculiar life e 2

952 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. to the colour that will subsequently prevail, and which is owing' to the internal substance. The hue remains light until after birth. At this period the hair of the head is often more than half an inch in length, while upon the remainder of the body nothing but down, a fore-runner of hair, is observable, particularly in the face. The hair of the head then appears some time before that on other parts of the body. Subsequent to birth, the growth of hair is much more rapid than previous to it. In this re- spect it is quite different from most of the other parts, which are much more rapidly developed in the womb. During infancy, it is of a lighter colour than when the body has attained maturity. The light colour acquires more of the auburn cast, and the dark and red become more intense, until to- wards the twenty-sixth or the thirtieth year. The lighter shades are in respect to the system of the hair, what the deficiency of energy in forms is to the muscular cellular systems, &c. Frequently that which will subsequently prove light, bears a whitish appearance, which colour proceeds solely from the nature of the internal substance, and not from a deficiency of this substance, as in old age. Thus the white of the Albinos also proceeds from the particular nature of this substance. This system is not completely developed in youth.

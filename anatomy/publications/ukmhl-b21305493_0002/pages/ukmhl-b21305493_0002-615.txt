MUCOUS SYSTEM. 573 that, in general, the thickness does not cor- respond to these dimensions. Thus the bones of the cranium, though proportionally much wider in the foetus than those of the pelvis, are not the thickest. The dura-mater is proportionally more extended than the tunica albuginea, which belongs to the same system, but its organization is not more complete. In the foetus, the mucous tissue is excessively thin : the papillae are almost imperceptible, but by passing the hand gently over a mucous surface, it has a remarkable soft velvety feel, such even as art cannot imitate. The red colour of this system is not so deep then, undoubtedly, because it is per- meated with less blood, as the various functions connected with it, digestion, excretion, respira- tion, &c. are not very active, and are even com- pletely null. At this period the quantity of blood in the skin, and in these surfaces, appears to be quite in a reverse sense. The mucous surfaces, like the muscles, are of a very deep or even livid colour, on account of the nature of the blood circulated by the arteries. Then the adhesions of the mucous tissue with the subjacent cellular tissue are less firm, and particularly that of the latter, with the surrounding parts. Thus a part of the internal surface of the intestines of the foetus may be easily withdrawn from within 1 external coating, so as to form two cylindri- cal tubes, one of which is muscular and serous,

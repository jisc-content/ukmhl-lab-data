MUSCULAR SYSTEM 438 ing, and what is the effect of irritability; 1st. If a living frog, from which the cutis has been se- parated, be plunged into a strongly concentrated acid, every part is instantly disorganized ; the re-agent is so powerful, it is impossible to distin- guish either contractility or shrinking ; 2dly. If we dilute the acid a little, and dip another frog into it, the inferior limbs immediately be- come stiff from the contraction of the extensors, which counterbalance the power of the flexors ; in this experiment this phenomenon is almost in- variable : if the animal be withdrawn, the thighs remain motionless, and their life is destroyed; for the contraction that has been produced was not a vital phenomenon. A dead frog immersed in the same liquor undergoes the same phenome- non; reduce the acid still more, the limbs of the \ animal contract the moment he is dropped in; but relaxation will succeed contraction ; these are alternate motions of irritability when brought into action. If the acid, however, has not been suffi- ciently reduced, some marks of shrinking still subsist, and the motions of the posterior extremi- ties are constrained: an evident result of the first degree of shrinking; Finally. If the acid be very weak, it becomes a simple excitant, which produces sensible organic contractility without injuring the tissue of the fibres; when taken from the fluid the animal retains the same powers of motion.

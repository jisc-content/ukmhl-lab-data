Most commonly the wide muscles are single ones; several are rarely united to form com- pound muscles : similar to the long muscles they are separated by different cellular layers, but are seldom, like the latter, covered by aponeuroses ; the greatest number of them are placed immedi- ately below the integuments; the reason is, that by their forms they are naturally secured against those displacements that have been mentioned when speaking of the aponeuroses, and to which, were it not for these membranes, the muscles of the long bones would be so frequently exposed. I have never heard that the cramp has ever been felt in these muscles. When by dividing the integuments of a living animal, the abdominal muscles are laid bare, I have observed, that on contracting, the whole of each preserves its sta- tion. section in. t Fonns of the Short Muscles.

22 5 FIB R OU S S Y STEM. f .-SECTION IV. X- ( Perichondrium. i j Every non-articulating cartilage is covered with a membrane perfectly similar to the perios- teum, and denominated perichondrium; the larynx, the ribs, &cÂ« are striking instances of it: it is thin, its fibres are intersected in every direction, and are less intimately attached to the organ it covers than the periosteum is with the bone, because the sur- face of cartilages not containing such a considera- ble number of apertures, does not project such a profusion of fibrous threads; hence there is a less intimate connection between the vitality of the perichondrium and that of the cartilage, than be- tween that of the bone and its periosteum. I have twice, in a young dog, stripped the thy- roid cartilage of its external membrane, and closed the wound immediately; it healed perfectly, without any apparent alteration in the cartilage ; at least the functions of this organ continued un- interrupted. A similar experiment might be easily tried upon the ribs, but I have not at- tempted it. In various injections, the perichon- drium did not appear to me to contain so great a number of blood-vessels as the periosteum : its uses are analogous to those of this last membrane. VOL. II. o

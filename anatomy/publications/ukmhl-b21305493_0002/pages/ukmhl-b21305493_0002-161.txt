The increase in the second direction does not take place outwardly, but internally ; the tube of the root and the cavity of the body progressively contract, and ultimately become obliterated; then the blood no longer penetrating the tooth, the nerves no longer convey their influence to it; it dies, and falls. This state, however, seems also brought on by the accumulation of the bony sub- stance of a considerable quantity of calcareous phosphate, which so much exceeds the ge- latine, that the principle of life is completely stifled, so that in this respect the fall of the teeth displays a phenomenon similar to that of the horns in the herbivorous species, or of the calcareous envelope, in the crustaceous tribe, &c.

The abrupt and sudden contraction produced by the will, or by exciting a nerve, the most common mode of motion either in the natural state, or in that of convulsions ; 3dly. The kind of oscillation I have just men- tioned, and which, affecting every individual fibre in a muscle, will not, however, produce any sen- sible effect on the whole ; reduces it but indiffe- rently, and consequently does not cause its move- able points to approximate. This is the mode of motion in the shiverings attending cold, fear, and the accession of intermittent fevers, &c. On applying the apparatus requisite for the ex- periment in the bare muscle of an animal shiver- ing under the application, this kind of contraction is found perfectly to resemble that produced by strewing with pulverised salt, a part of the mus- cular system : then, although there is in every muscle an internal motion, much more striking than in considerable contractions, the position of the limbs is but slightly affected ; there is hardly any general motion. 10. There are also other motions of contraction less apparent than these, but still rather different. In general, a peculiar mode of contraction is adapted to each species of muscular motion : how- ever limited may be our experiments upon living animals, we may easily conceive how far the B B 2

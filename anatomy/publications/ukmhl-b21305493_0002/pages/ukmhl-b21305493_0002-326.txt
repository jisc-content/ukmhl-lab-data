muscular system 284 occasion to observe, by macerating the muscles in a cellar where the temperature undergoes no variations. At other times, instead of putrefying thus, the muscle, as Fourcroy has very correctly observed, is converted into a substance similar to spermaceti, then the fibre is hard and solid ; but every muscle preserved in water, is very far from displaying this phenomena. Frequently when it is undergoing this change, a kind of reddish pro- duct is disseminated from space to space over the surface of the muscle, an evident effect of decomposition, announcing and subsequently at- tending this state, which, however, is frequently effected without it. Maceration in our dissecting rooms affords numerous instances of it. When by repeated washing, the muscles have been deprived of their colouring matter, there remains a white fibrous tissue, from which may also be extracted by ebullition, albumine, . that rises in the form of scum, gelatine, collected on cooling, a portion of extractive matter deeply coloured on concentrating, and a few phosphoric salts. When all these substances have been ex- tracted, the residue of the muscle consists of a fibrous substance, greyish, insoluble in hot water ? soluble by acids, producing a quantity of azote, by the action of nitric acid, and possessed of every character of the fibrine of the blood. It appears, as Fourcroy has judiciously observed, that this is actually the nutritive substance of the muscle,

27 OSSEOUS SYSTEM* The formation of cancelli is completed when every epiphysis has disappeared. At this period, it displays an infinity of fibres that seem to arise from the internal surface of the compact tissue, projecting in every direction, crossing each other, uniting together, separating, dividing, and assuming in fact such irregular di- rections, that it is impossible to follow them in their course. Their volume is no less variable, such is at times their excessive tenuity, that they are ruptured by the slightest contact; at other times, their thickness is tolerably striking. In- stead of fibres, lamellae, varying in their extent, are often found, from which smaller lamellae seem to ramify, arise, and from which there results whenever they are very close, a kind of ducts, easily perceived on sawing transversely the end of a long bone, to obtain a segment of half an inch. The cellulae formed by their partitions are re- markably irregular, both in form and in capa- city. They all communicate, as is proved by the fol- lowing experiments. 1st. If the end of a long bone, the surface of a flat or of a short bone, be perforated, and mercury poured in, it crosses all the communications to flow through the various natural passages on the surface of the bone, which of themselves open into the cellulae. 2nd. If a bone be sawed at one of the ends, and plastered

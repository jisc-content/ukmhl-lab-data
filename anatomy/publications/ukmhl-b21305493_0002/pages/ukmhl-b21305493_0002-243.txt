By the excessive mobility of rheumatic pains which fly with astonishing rapidity from one part to another, and consequently imply that the vi- tal powers of the different parts of this system may undergo alterations with the greatest rapi- dity ; 5thly0 By its cicatrizing more rapidly. Thus in laying bare a fracture made expressly in animals, I have constantly noticed, that granu- lations proceeding from the periosteum and the medullary organ, were formed before those of the bone had hardly begun to appear. In regard to this cicatrization, I have observed that the parts of the fibrous system which admit the greatest number of blood-vessels, such as the periosteum, the fibrous membranes, the capsules, &c. more rea- dily admit of this phenomenon, than those where little or hardly any blood is admitted, as in ten- dons, the ends of which unite with difficulty only; 6thly, and finally, The difference between the vitality of the fibrous system and that of the

SEROUS SYSTEM. 583 parts, although continued and investing, the one, the internal surface of the cavity wherein they are met with, the other the organs of their cavity. Thus, there is a pleura costalis, and a pleura pul- monalis, a double arachnoid membrane ; one part of the peritoneum folded over the gastric or- gans, and the other extended over the abdominal parietes; one part of the pericardium free, and another adhering to the heart. A similar arrange- ment is observed in the testis, &c. Although the serous membranes are separated from each other, yet there sometimes exists communications between them; that, for instance, between the cavities of the epiploon and perito- neum ; that of the arachnoidean cavity, with the cavity of the membrane that lines the ventricles by the canal I have discovered, the external ori- fice of which is seen under, and in the posterior part of the corpus callosum; whilst the internal one is above the pineal gland between the two rows of the small spherical bodies generally met with in this part. i There is but a single instance of continuity between the serous and mucous membranes; namely, between the peritoneum and the uterine surface. How is it that the nature of the two re- spective membranes are changed in this part ?

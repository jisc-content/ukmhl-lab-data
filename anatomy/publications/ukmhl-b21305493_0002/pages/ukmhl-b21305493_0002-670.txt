SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. G28 fluid through the pores of an organ, towards which that fluid is mechanically directed. Let us examine which of these three modes nature has selected to deposit synovia over the articu- lating surfaces. Is the Synovia transmitted by Secretion to the Articulating Surfaces ? We are indebted to Clopton Havers for the J system by which the sources of synovia are ascribed to the glands. Several authors prior to him had described them confusedly in the articu- lation ; but he made them the special object of his researches, described them in the different articulations, separated them into two classes, the One principal, the other accessory, and assigned to these organs such evident characters, that, ac- cording to him, it was impossible to disown them. Reddish spongy spherical bodies, formed out of the folds of membranes, sometimes situate within the articulations, at other times externally, but invariably disposed in such a manner as to be protected from too strong compression, and pouring through tubes, disposed in the form of a fringe, the fluid they separate. Such are the cha- racters traced by Havers, characters every anato- mist has borrowed from him, and the reality of which the most modern and celebrated authors have sanctioned in their works.

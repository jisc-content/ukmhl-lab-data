OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 9G appearance quite different to the natural one; if subsequent to the amputation, the madder be dis- continued for some time, and another limb be re- moved, the bone will have completely re-assumed its natural hue. Now, is it not sufficiently known, that the calcareous substance is the colouring vehicle; since, as long as the bones remain in a cartilaginous state, the madder has no effect. The calcareous substance, then, is alternately conveyed to, or taken away from, the bones ; be- sides, the formation and resolution of exostoses, the softening and brittleness of the bone, the phe- nomena of the production of the callus, &c., are they not evident proofs of the successive exhala- tion and absorption of this principle ? It appears evident, that nature has selected the urinary sys- tem to expel the earthy and even the gelatinous substance. It would be interesting to analyze, pro- perly, the urine of rickety subjects, and of those afflicted with cancer ; it is highly probable that the first of these substances predominates in the first case, and the second, in the other. Nothing very positive, I believe, has yet been dis- covered in this respect by experiments. Will gelatine, or calcareous phosphates, given to pa- tients, restore to the bones, either the suppleness or consistence they have lost ? No, undoubtedly, because it is not sufficient to introduce these sub- stances into the economy, but also to restore to the bones the mode of organic sensibility they are

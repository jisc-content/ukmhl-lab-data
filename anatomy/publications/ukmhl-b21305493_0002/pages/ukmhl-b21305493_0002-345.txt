Those with which many aponeuroses are intermixed, that partly borrow their extent from these mem- branes, or from the tendons, do not so fully en- joy this property. Hence, in the very same mo- tions, mi s lies of the same length contract or elongate their fleshy parts to a greater or less de- gree. Let it be observed, however, that when the tendinous portion predominates very consi- derably, or that, on the other hand, it appears to be very thin, it also yields a little, as we see in- stances of in the plantaris, in the palmaris, &c. When from the natural we proceed to the pathological state, we find muscular extensibility displayed in a still more striking degree in the face ; air accumulated in the mouth, swells it by lengthening the buccinators ; the various tumours of this cavity, the funguses, the sarcomas, fre- quently distend the small facial muscles, in a man- ner that would strike us, if in the production of this phenomenon, we only allowed for the small extent of these muscles, which, in such cases are extended three or even four-fold. The muscles of the eyelids, of the eye, in the carcinoma of that organ, those of the anterior parts of the neck, in large swellings in the thyroid gland, the great pectoral muscle in extensive aneurisms or other tumours of the armpit, the abdominal muscles

The first part of this work has been devoted to researches on the systems common to the struc- ture of every part, on the primitive systems that form, as it were, the nutritive parenchyma, the basis of every organ, since there is hardly one of these organs in which the arteries, the veins, the exhalants, the absorbents, the nerves, and the cellular tissue do not form a more or less essential part.

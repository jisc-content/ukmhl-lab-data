451 OF ORGANIC LIFE. vow the exterior muscles remain unmoved, whilst the internal still continue active. So many instances have been quoted of this permanence, and Haller has made so many experiments on this head, that I think it unnecessary to quote further proofs of a fact no longer called in question; to this are owing the evacuations of feeces and urine which take place subsequent to death; the vomitings noticed in some subjects, if not so evident as during life, are yet sufficient to bring up the food to the mouth of the corpse, which, as I have observed, is sometimes filled. Two kinds of death in respect to this perma- nent state, as well as to the continuance of ani- mal contractility, may be distinguished; 1st. Sudden death ; 2dly. That brought on by long continued disease. In every sudden death, produced either by a violent injury of the brain, as in apoplexy, con- cussion, compression, effusion, &c. or by an affec- tion of the heart, as in prolonged syncopy, a wound, a ruptured aneurism, or by the lungs ceasing to act, as in asphyxia from deleterious gases, from vacuum, submersion, &c. the continu- ance of contractility is very obvious; general death first ensues, then the organs individually die, and all the vital powers fall in succession. In every kind of death slowly produced, par- ticularly in that preceded by a decline, the partial death of each organ is first observed ; all the vital G G 2

287 OF ANIMAL LIFE. It is not my intention to make a farther analysis of boiled meat; but what ought not to be passed un- noticed here, are the phenomena that are seated in the fibre, during the extraction of the preceding product either from this organ or from the ad- jacent tissues. j These phenomena may be referred to three periods; 1st. Prior to ebullition, as long as the water is only gently warm, even rather under the temperature of natural heat, the muscular tissue is merely somewhat softened; 2ndly. When the water is almost boiling, and an albuminous scum begins to form upon the surface of the water, the muscle shrinks, contracts, and acquires a degree of density, much superior to that of its natural state, and its resistance is considerably increased. I have ascertained that in this state muscles will bear a much greater weight than in their natural state. They have more of that remarkable den- sity, by which they are characterized during contraction in the living subject, and which so effectually prevents their being ruptured. This condensation of the muscular tissue suddenly produced rather increases until the time of ebul- lition, when it has attained its utmost degree, at which it remains stationary for some time ; 3rdly. By degrees this density decreases, the fibres become softer, and are lacerated with more facility than in their natural state. This softening, quite the reverse of the preceding state, is slowly and

The cavities of nutrition, on the contrary, give passage to the vessels that convey to the bone and medullary organ the substances that repair their waste. There are three species. Some are exclusively observed in the long bones that are provided with a medullary canal, one only for each bone situate along the body, directed in an oblique line between the fibres of the compact tissue, penetrating sometimes from the upper to the lower part, at other times quite in a reverse sense into the cavity of the bone, and thus establishing for the vessel of the medul- lary organ, a communication from the external to the internal parts. This aperture in fact is especially intended for the nutrition of that organ, and nourishes the bone in an auxiliary manner only. The second species of cavities for nutrition especially belongs to the cancelli of the bones. Thus, where this tissue abounds, it is in the heads of the long bones, on the circumference of the flat, and over the whole superfices of the short bones. They have a more extensive diameter than that of the tube that penetrates the medullary canal, but less so than those of the compact tissue. Their number is very great. I have enumerated as many as one hundred and forty on the tibial

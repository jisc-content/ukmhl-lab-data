761 dermoidal system. rally admit of this passive state ; these functions are limited to protect the body and screen it from mechanical injury. It forms our proper covering1. Hence it is possessed of properties perfectly calcu- lated for this use; it is excessively resistant; very considerable weights are required to rend slight straps of corium drawn in divers ways; it also requires considerable exertion to produce the same effect. This resistance, however, is much less than when the corium has been tanned : we know that thus prepared, that portion of the skin affords us the strongest ties of our manufactories. I know of but two tissues in the economy uniting so much suppleness with resistance. It is this and the fibrous ; and this is an additional assimilating cha- racter. We have seen that considerable weights were required to rend a tendon, a shred of aponeurosis, or a ligament taken from the corpse. The muscular, nervous, arterial, veinous, cellular tissues, &c. are much sooner parted, and if the tis- sue of the dermis admitted of less extensibility, it might, with much advantage, be substituted to tendons, ligaments, &c. in the structure of the body. Since the corium is a stranger to almost every sensitive and morbific phenomenon of the skin, let us then ascertain which are the parts of the der- mis that are the seat of these phenomena. These parts are very evident on the external surface ;

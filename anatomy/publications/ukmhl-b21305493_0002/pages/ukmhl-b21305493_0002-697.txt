SYNOVIA1, SYSTEM. 655 according' to the disposition of the tendon, but their general disposition is invariable. Hence we conceive that each tendinous synovial sheath has two faces, the one forming the interior of the sac, which is wholly detached, the other lining the adjacent organs. The free surface is incessantly moistened with a fluid perfectly similar to that of the articulations, formed like the latter by exhalations, and not from the adjacent reddish bodies, as authors had asserted ; bodies which most generally cannot be traced, and which, wherever they do exist, have nothing of a glandular nature. In general, this fluid is not quite so abundant as in articulations, in the corpse at least. But varieties are observed in the different synovial bags : those of the tendo- achilles, of the united tendons of the iliacus in- ternus and psoas muscles, &c. are always danjper than those of the tendons of the flexors, &c. r Does the peculiar crackling noise sometimes produced by the motions of the tendons proceed from the deficiency of synovia? I have merely observed, that this noise bears some analogy to that of the articulations of the fingers when thev are suddenly bent; a crackling, not derived, as might be thought, from the friction of the bony surfaces: once produced, in fact, it cannot be created again although friction be renewed. Be- sides, it is well known, this crackling proceeds from the mechanical distension of the plalanges,

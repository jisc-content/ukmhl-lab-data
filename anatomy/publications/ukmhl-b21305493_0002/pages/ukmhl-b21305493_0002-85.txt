OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 43 tissue, also receive a few branches. A vein every where attends the artery, and follows its various distributions. The vessels of the second order belong to the cancelli of the long and short bones, they are in an equal number with the apertures of that tissue, ramify over the cellulae, and communicate with the marrow and the compact tissue. At the mo- ment of death, the small arteries generally re- main filled with red blood, which points out their course, and which, by their excessive tenuity would otherwise be inscrutable, being but very imper- fectly demonstrated by injections. The veins that accompany these arteries can hardly be seen. The blood vessels of the third order are nothing more than the ramifications of the arteries that surround the bones, ramifications that crowd in the compact tissue, and are lost in it. The ex- istence of these minute branches may be eluci- dated in various ways. 1st. By lifting the dura- mater from the internal surface of the scull, a profusion of small bloody drops point out the laceration. Â£dly. By removing the periosteum of a middle aged subject, a similar phenomenon is produced. I have noticed that these experiments are particularly successful in drowned subjects, in animals purposely suffocated, on account of the great quantity of blood their vessels contain. 3dly. If a long bone be fractured in the middle, the compact part that forms the medullary tube,

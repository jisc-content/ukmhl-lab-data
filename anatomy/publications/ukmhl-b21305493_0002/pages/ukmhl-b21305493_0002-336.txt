MUSCULAR SYSTEM 294 three isolated parts, then irritate one of these portions, the other, or the two others, will remain unmoved in almost every instance, whilst a single fibre being irritated in an uninjured muscle, will set the whole muscle in motion. The section of the vessels of the nerves, may undoubtedly have, some influence in producing this phenomenon, but certainly that of the cellular tissue also con- tributes to it. In dropsical subjects, the serum of the inter- muscular tissue has frequently a reddish appear- ance; this phenomenon is peculiar to the dead body, and proceeds from the serum having acted subsequent to death upon the colouring matter. I believe that this could not easily take place dur- ing life. Fat sometimes superabounds in this tissue, so far even that every fibre involved, as it were by it, is concealed, and this substance only remains apparent; but frequently also the yel- lowish aspect of the fibres is mistaken for an adipose state of the muscles, an aspect proceed- ing from the absence of the colouring matter. I have seldom ascertained the first state, the second very frequently ; one might easily be de- ceived by it at the first glance. By ebullition and combustion, it is easily ascertained that fat has nothing to do with the discolouration of the mus- cles examined in that state.

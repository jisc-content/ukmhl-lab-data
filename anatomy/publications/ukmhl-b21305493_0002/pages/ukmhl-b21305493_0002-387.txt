OF ANIMAL LlFfi. Ho had been authorized to try galvanic experiments. This also explains why the alternate motions of respiration may be continued for a levy moments longer after the brain has been destroyed. In a wound of the head, by which the brain has been crushed, after a luxation of the first vertebrae, by which the origin of the spinal marrow has been so compressed as to destroy life immediately, or after injecting a very irritating fluid through the carotid, &c. &c. In this continuance of animal contractility after the cessation of life, the muscles are completely passive, they obey, as they did during life, the impulse given by the nerves: it is this which distinguishes it from irritability, a property by which, both in life and death, the muscle contains within itself, the principle of motion. According to the class to which the animal belongs, this continuance of animal contractility is more or less extended. Those possessed only of cold and red blood, retain that property much longer than those circulating red and warm blood ; amongst the latter, ducks are, as I have said, very remarkable for this phenomenon, which is longer continued than with other birds, or than with quadrupeds. The first class also admits of varieties, in reptiles, in fishes, &c. I have generally observed, that subsequent to death the source of animal contractility ceases, first in the brain, then in the marrow, and finally

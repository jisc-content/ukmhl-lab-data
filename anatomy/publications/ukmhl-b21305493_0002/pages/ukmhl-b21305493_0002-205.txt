Now, the re- union is easier in proportion as the inflammatory periods in the two divided parts in contact, cor- respond. This explains why two parts of the same organ are much sooner united, than two sur- faces proceeding from different organs; why, the greater analogy there is in the degree of vitality of two distinct organs, the less difficulty will attend the union ; why the difficulty is in- creased in proportion as the distinctions in vitality become more striking. Two surfaces of bones in perfect contact will require thirty or forty days to effect their reunion ; the same phenomenon is accomplished in the lips of a cutaneous division, in the course of two or three days. If we intend to conjoin two organs so very dissimilar in their mode of cicatrization, by bringing them in con- tact, we shall succeed but slowly. If the bony end of an amputated stump be covered with the skin, the latter begins to sup- purate when the bone has scarcely softened : thus skilful practitioners have completely laid aside these pretended unions by the first intention subsequent to amputation, and which have been so much extolled. These unions would un- doubtedly take place, if the vitality of the or- M 2

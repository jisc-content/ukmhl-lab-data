MUSCULAR SYSTEM 330 utmost extent. Nothing is more common than to see the abdomen and the chest in their natural degree of muscular contraction, whilst the limbs or the face are distorted with convulsive motions. In most cases of hemiphlegia the mouth is distorted; the upper and lower extremities on one side are motionless, and yet the pectoral and abdominal muscles continue to act: the muscles of the larynx are much sooner affected with paralysis than these; hence the different alterations to which the voice is liable. A proportionate scale for the susceptibility of muscles for receiving the cerebral influence, or of the nerves for propa- gating it, would not be difficult to form, for it cannot be easily determined to which of these two phenomena the cause is owing. At the top of this scale might be placed the muscles of the limbs, then, in succession, those of the face, of the larynx, those of the abdomen find pelvis, and finally the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm : the latter are, of all the muscles, the least suscepti- ble of being paralyzed. Let us observe how very properly this scale would be accommodated to that of the functions ; what would become of life, intimately connected with the perfect state of respiration, if every cerebral injury were as readily transmitted to the diaphragm, and to the intercostal muscles, as to those of the limbs? Paralysis of the latter deprives the animal of one

105 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. often judge of the vitality of an organ more from its morbid alterations than its natural state ; 2d. It appears that, in the enamel there is no such thing as alternate exhalation aud absorption of nutritive matter, in a visible manner at least. It is worn away without being renewed. This is re- markable in the aged subject, and in those that fre- quently gnash their teeth. The enamel may be filed as any inorganic body, and is never re-pro- duced, whilst the hair, and the nails, evidently grow after they have been cut. If the end of a long bone sawed in amputation be filed, granula- tions will soon form over the surface, the action of the instrument being a stimulant that excites developement of the vital phenomena. The bony part of the tooth, forms the whole root and the interior of the crown ; it is only com- posed of compact tissue, excessively dense, bear- ing the utmost analogy with that of the rock,â€”it has no cancelli. Its fibres strongly compressed together, take various directions, that cannot be easily followed, but which are generally arranged as those in the roots; to obtain a correct view of these, the tooth must be softened by an acid. Each tooth contains within the crown a cavity of the same form, which decreases in diameter as we advance in years; which communicates out- wardly by small tubes equal in number with the distinct roots of the tooth, and opens over the

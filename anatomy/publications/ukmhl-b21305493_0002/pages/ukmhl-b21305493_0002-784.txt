The activity of glands that still fulfil their office seems to depend upon two causes; 1st. Decomposition being striking at that age, a pro- fusion of substances are conveyed to these'glands to be expelled. The decay of the aged subject is a phenomenon the reverse of the rapid growth in the foetus, in which the glandular system hardly rejected any thing out of the economy; 2dly. The skin wrinkled and contracted, partly ceasing to be an emunctory for the produces of decompo- sition, the glands act as substitutes for these func- tions. The cutaneous and glandular systems are then in the very same connection, as they are during winter and in cold climates ; whereas we have seen the functions of the one are often suc- ceeded by those of the other. The glandular system in general is one of those from which life departs most slowly. In the aged corpse, the gall bladder is still found filled with bile, the bladder with urine, &c. All the glands on being compressed, the prostate even, emit abundance of fluid from their excretory ducts. I have even observed that more fluid is generally obtained by compression from the aged subject than from the infant. The older the ani- mal, the stronger the smell of urine in the kid- ney.

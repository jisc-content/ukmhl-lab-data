FIBROUS SYSTEM. 191 SECTION II. Common Parts entering into the Organization of the Fibrous System. The cellular tissue is met with in every fibrous organ, but in more or less abundance, accordingly as their fibres are more distant or more con- tracted. In some ligaments, it forms for the fibrous bundles, sheaths similar to those* for muscles; in others, in tendons, aponeuroses, &c. it is scarcely perceived, but is rendered every where very evident, by maceration, by morbid affections ; for instance, in the funguses of the dura-mater, in the carcinomia of the testis, that has invaded the tunica albuginea, in certain affections of the periosteum, &c. In all these cases the fibrous tissue, relaxed, softened, vitiated, and converted into a spongy substance, suffers its fibres to disunite, and the cellular tissue to appear bare. The formation of granulations, the soft nature of these productions in certain wounds, in which the fibrous organ has been concerned, also prove the presence of the cellular organ, which besides is here in general met with in a trifling degree,â€”a circumstance that contributes a great deal in producing the resistance and power in the organs that belong to them. Does this cellular tissue contain any fat ? None is ob- served at first sight, since the tissue in itself is

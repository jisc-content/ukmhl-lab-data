To this excessive thickness of the epidermis in the soles of the feet and palms of the hands I at- tribute the difficulty, nay, the impossibility, of blistering these parts; this application I had often prescribed, conceiving that they were en- dowed with more sensibility: I expected greater effect in certain diseases, but every attempt having proved fruitless, I was obliged to give it up.

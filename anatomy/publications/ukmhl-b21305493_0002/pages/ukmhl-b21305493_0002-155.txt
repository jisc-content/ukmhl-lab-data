This disposition of the lower jaw has a great influence upon the expression of the features. First Dentition considered during the Protrusion. Towards the sixth or seventh month subsequent to birth, very seldom before, still less frequently during pregnancy, although there are some instances of it, as is proved by the history of Lewis XIV., the following phenomena are ob- served. Sometimes simultaneously, at other times in an isolated manner, the two small incisores of the lower jaw, and soon after the corresponding ones of the upper jaw, begin first to appear. A month or two subsequent to this, the four other in- cisores are produced. Towards the end of the first year, generally the four canine teeth are cut. At the end of the second, and frequently later than this, two grinders are seen to project from each jaw, and are soon followed by two more, each eruption generally beginning with the inferior VOL. ii.

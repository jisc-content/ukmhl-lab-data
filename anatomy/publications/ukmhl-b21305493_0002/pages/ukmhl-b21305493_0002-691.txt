SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 619 This mode of sensibility of the synovial mem- branes, helps to confirm what I have said before: namely, that the major part of the articulations, those forming a hinge in particular, are not pos- sessed of fibrous capsules. In fact, I have already proved, that these capsules, as well as the lateral ligaments, are endowed with a mode of animal sensibility, very conspicuous when they are drawn out; so that, if an articulation be stript of every surrounding organ, excepting the synovial and lateral ligaments, and it is then twisted, violent pain is produced ; but if these ligaments be subse- quently divided, and the synovial membrane only left, the joint may be twisted without producing pain. This experiment easily repeated in the anterior and posterior limbs, may serve to point out those articulations in which a synovial mem- brane exists exclusively, and those wherein this organ is joined to a fibrous capsule. This being of a similar texture as the lateral ligaments, pro- duces the same pains when drawn, as is proved besides, by experiments tried on articulations possessed of such capsules. Insensible contractility, is obvious in the exhala- tions and absorptions alternately performed by the synovial membranes. I have already remarked, that the synovial mem- branes act but a very indifferent part in sympa- thies, and rarely partake of the affections of other organs. Whilst in the acute diseases of an impor-

It is well known, that the tanned skin is no longer what it was in the natural state, and that it bor- rows from the substance with which it is impreg- nated an artificial degree of consistence. If com- bined with any considerable quantity of tan, it loses entirely the power of contracting and is liable to crack; whilst if only slightly impreg- nated with this acid, it retains its suppleness in some degree, as well as its contractile powers, if sub- mitted to the action of fire.

Every part of the dermis contains a redund- ant quantity of this tissue, wherein it is arranged as follows: a multiplicity of projecting threads shoot from the uppermost surface of the sub- cutaneous cellular layer, penetrate into the areolae that are contiguous to the corium, of course plunge into those situate more externally, and, finally, terminate in the innumerable pores

OF ANIMAL LIFE- 319 cular action will increase in energy in proportion as that of the brain is increased. If terror, by weakening the powers of the heart, and on that account the quantity of blood conveyed to the brain destroys its power; if the dif- ferent narcotics, carried to an excess, produce a similar effect; if wine obstructs its action when used in an immoderate quantity, then the muscles are seen languid in their motions, and experience even a remarkable intermission. If the brain be completely concentrated in its connections with our senses, or in its intellectual functions, its in- fluence is diverted from the muscles, and these organs are left inactive :â€”he whose attention is completely captivated in looking or listening at- tentively, does not move ; and in contemplation, reflection, or meditation, he is similarly influenced. The phenomena of ecstasies, the history of the studies of our philosophers, frequently present this important fact, this muscular relaxation, the principle of which rests in a revulsion of the cerebral influence, that is increased in other func- tions to the detriment of locomotion. All causes which in diseases powerfully act upon the brain, spontaneously re-act upon the muscular system of animal life, and this re-action is obvious in two reverse states, in paralysis and spasm. The first state indicates a loss of energy, the second an increase; the one is produced in compressions caused by pus, by effusions of blood,

SEROUS SYSTEM. 618 large cavities, collections evidently owing to some- defect of the organs that habitually exhale this fluid. I shall make two observations in,this re- spect : the first is, that the serous membranes nearest to the diseased organ, are in general the most liable to be influenced by that organ. Thus in the diseases of the heart and l;ungs, collections of serum are apt to form in the chest, whilst acites is constantly the first result of obstructions of the liver, spleen, &c.: the pleura and pericardium only fill subsequently. We are aware that the major part of saricoceles are complicated with dropsies of the tunica vaginalis testis ; a disease which sur- geons consider abstractedly ; but it is the same as those of the preceding cases, which in this respect might be called hydro-phthisis, chronic hydro-hepatitis, hydro-carcinoma of the ute- rus, &c. The second observation is, that whenever serum thus accumulates in the cavities, in consequence of any organic injury sustained by a viscus foreign to the membrane this serum is limpid, transparent, and probably of the same nature as that circulated in the lymphatic vessels. The exhalents it is composed of not being actually diseased, their action being increased, or that of the absorbents reduced by sympathy only, the fluid must remain the same. Thus, although the presence of a stone in the bladder causes pain at the extremity of the glands, the penis is per-

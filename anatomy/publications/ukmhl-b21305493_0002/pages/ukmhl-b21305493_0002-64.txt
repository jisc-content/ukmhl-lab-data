OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 22 are all lined with a cartilage, and completed by a very strong ligamentous ring. Are these cavi- ties formed by the continual friction of the ten- dons ? It is a general opinion, but no more pro- bable to me than the theory of the muscular and vascular impressions, &c. These cavities should, in this case, be deeper as the muscles are more exercised; they should not exist in subjects para- lytic from infancy, nor in the cartilages of ossifi- cation in the foetus whose limbs undergo but little motion : but the reverse is constantly observed. Let us then consider the different configurations of bones, as naturally resulting from the laws of ossification, laws from which every conformation of the bone originally fixed is merely developed. The volume of the heads of the long bones is fa- vourable to the existence of these different cavi- ties, which, on this account, cannot be detrimental to the solidity of the organ. 4th. The cavities of impression correspond with the eminences of the same description. I have mentioned them before. 5th. The cavities of transmission are espe- cially intended for vessels and nerves. Several are met with in the head ; sometimes they assume the form of a whole, sometimes that of a tube. On other occasions again, that of a slit, according to the width and thickness of the bone which these vessels or nerves have to cross, to proceed from one part to another. The periosteum

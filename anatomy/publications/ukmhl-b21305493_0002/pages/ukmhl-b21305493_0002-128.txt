86 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. be united by ligaments only, consequently in- tended for the moveable articulations, as the femur, the tibia, the clavicle, &c. &c. are very distinct. The flat bones, especially those of the skull, do not display a cartilaginous state in so striking a light. In this period of ossification their appear- ance, proceeding from the following causes, is ra- ther more that of a membrane :â€”As they are in- terposed between the periosteum and the dura- mater, and their tenuity is excessive, they can- not be perceived without the utmost difficulty in the interior of these two membranes : but when- ever the parts are dissected with due attention, the bone, although still soft, may be distinguished from this double envelopement. The cartilaginous state is apparent in the clavi- cle, the shoulder bone, and the ribs, prior to its being distinct in the other bones wherein it is subsequently deposited. When the bones are ex- amined in that state, they disclose different de- grees of consistence and solidity. Where exhala- tion of gelatine has commenced, they are but im- perfectly cartilaginous, and in proportion as we examine them at an earlier period, they are still seen to partake more or less of the mucous state : the cartilaginous bone is unprovided with an in- ernal cavity, with a medullary system, &c.

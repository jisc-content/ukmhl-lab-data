DEUMOJDAL SYSTEM. 780 proach more that of winter, cannot bear it. They become torpid in subterranean holes, the heat of which, like that of cellars, remains nearly the same, and awake only when stimulated by the milder temperature of spring. 5thly. In very cold climates, the skin on the other hand appears to form an obstacle to all sudden escape of caloric from the interior, to bring the body in equipoise with the surrounding atmosphere. This is obvious in the polar regions. Here, however, I must make a remark which is quite the reverse of the preceding. It is that the cetaceous species swim in those very seas, the temperature of which is the most reverse of theirs. The whale is chiefly killed in high latitudes, in Greenland, Spitzbergen, &c. How can it be ac- counted for then, that this fish, possessed of red warm blood, sports in those frozen regions, whilst our amphibious species, possessed of cold blood only, eagerly seek the scorching heat of the sun ? I do not know. It should be remarked, that the major part of the interior organs, on being laid bare in wounds, do not possess so completely as the skin, the fa- culty of retaining an independent temperature. As long as they remain healthy, the degree of temperature is much more rapidly increased or diminished. This phenomenon is obvious in the protruded gut during the operation for hernia, in muscles that are exposed, &c, &c. Thus in order

374 MUSCULAIl SYSTEM to produce the same effect, they all act at the same moment. Various means have been used to ascertain the effect a muscle of a straight direction might pro- duce on the bone in which it is implanted. This, which has not been pointed out, appears to me very simple. I believe it consists in examining the direction of the muscle from its fixed up to the moveable points, and to follow the reverse of that direction : this last is infallibly that of mo- tion : if it be intended to ascertain how the ante- rior radial acts upon the wrist, let us begin at its attachment to the condyle, follow from this its course in the inferior and outward direction, and we shall find it moves the hand upwards and downwards, that it bends it and rather brings it in adduction. The anterior tibial directed down- wards and inwards, raises the foot and brings it outwards: the rectus femoris, directed in a straight line from the pelvis towards the patella, raises the leg without causing the least deviation ; every other muscle displays the same disposition. Whatever may be the attachments which serve as a fixed or moveable point, they will always act in a reverse sense of their line of direction sup- posed to have begun at the first point, and as every insertion may in turn be the move- able or fixed point, the two bones are moved in reverse directions; the coraco brachialis

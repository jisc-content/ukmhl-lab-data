This opposition is a con- dition essential to motion; for in whatever direc- tion the limb be moved, the moveable point must necessarily be in the opposed motion ; the act of flexion requires it should be primitively extended, and vice versa. The two reverse positions as- sumed by a moveable part, are alternate in re- spect to that part; the points at .which motion begins and terminates, and the two extreme dis- tances of these positions, are the limits between which it is allowed to move. Now, between these two limits there is a medium point, it is that of rest of the moveable part, and in this position the muscles are in their natural state ; on deviating from it some are extended, whilst others are con- \ traded ; and they are so disposed, that the contrac- tions and extensions that are performed in reverse directions, are in exact proportion. Hence in the reciprocal influence the muscles possess over each other, these organs are alternately active and passive, an acting or a resisting power, organs moved, or moving organs. The effect then of every muscle that contracts, is not only to act upon the bone into which it is implanted, but also on the opposite muscle ; frequently even be- tween two antagonist muscles no solid organ is interposed, as in the lips, over the linea alba, &c. In this case the muscle of one side acts directly upon the one opposite, and distends it. Now this action of one muscle over the other, precisely VOL. II. x

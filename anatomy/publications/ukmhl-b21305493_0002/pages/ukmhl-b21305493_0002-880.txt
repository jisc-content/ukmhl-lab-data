DERMOIDAL system. 838 sensibility, and insensible contractility in the highest, degree. These properties, as I have said before, are especially seated in the exterior capillary system, forming the rete mucosum. They are unremittingly active to preside over, 1st, capil- lary circulation ; 2dly, exhalation ; 3dly, absorp- tion ; .4thly, the nutrition of the whole tissue of the dermis ; 5thly, the secretion of the cutaneous oil, if there be any such things in existence as subaceous glands. Connected thus with such a variety of functions, no wonder then, if these properties are so extensively developed in the skin : add to these considerations, the continued action of exterior forms, an action that keeps this organ as it were in an habitual state of irritation, constantly stimulating its sensibi- lity, and which action is to that sensibility what that of the substances contained within the mucous membranes is to the sensibility of these very membranes; the irritation even is more effec- * tual, because the exciting agents are more frequently renewed. Numberless substances, differing in density and composition, incessantly succeed each other on the exterior of the body, acting at the same time upon the animal sensibility of the skin, to form divers sensations; they stimulate the organic sensibility to effect those functions over which this sensibility presides. Should we be surprised then, if the major part of cutaneous affections, admit of alterations in

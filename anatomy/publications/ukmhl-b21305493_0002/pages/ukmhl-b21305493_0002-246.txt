FIBROUS SYSTEM. 204 aponeuroses; the distension of the ligaments in luxations of the foot, and the laceration of ten- dons, are frequently attended with convulsive mo- tions in the jaws,—even with confirmed teta- nes. A splinter in the dura mater will produce contractions in several muscles of the economy. In injuries of the tunica albuginea, and of the exterior aponeurosis similar phenomena are fre- quently observed. In the organic sympathies of the fibrous sys- tem, insensible organic contractility is sometimes called into action ; at other times it is the sensible organic contractility. The following are a few instances of the first case :—1st. The dura-mater being inflamed, inflammation, that naturally sup- poses an increase of the tonic powers, or of insen- sible organic contractility, frequently takes place in the pericranium, and vice versa. 2dly. The irritation of the periosteum, when rather con- siderable, frequently produces inflammation in the medullary organ, and causes that organ to sup- purate. Sdly. The articulating ligaments being distended by a sprain, all the adjacent parts, and frequently the whole limb, will swell and become a centre of irritation, in which the powers of vi- tality, particularly insensible contractility, are much greater than in the natural state, &c. At other times sensible organic contractility is called into action. 1st. In the operation of de- pressing the cataract, the injury to the scele-

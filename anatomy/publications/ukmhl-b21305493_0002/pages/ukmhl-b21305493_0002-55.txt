OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 13 tribute to form. Several are always united to form a cavity, and it is partly this circumstance that insures the solidity of the parts. In fact the force of exterior blows being expended in their sutures, they are not so easily fractured. If the cranium were composed but of one single piece, it would be more frequently fractured than in its natural state. In proportion as the sutures ossify in old age, the cranium becomes more brittle. In infants, in which ossification is not completed, and consequently the number of isolated bony parts is more numerous in the head, in the pelvis, &c. fractures are not produced without great force, because the soft ties that connect the solid parts, without fracturing, yield to external violence. Almost all the flat bones are curved, concave and convex, in their opposite surfaces, which is owing to their being intended to form cavities, their curvatures varying according to the part of the cavity where they are situate. This curvature is a very powerful cause of resistance, when that above mentioned no longer exists. Thus in the first stage of life, the skull resists fracture by yielding; but in proportion as the sutures become tighter, as it tends to form but one single bony mass, it is the mechanism of the arch that protects the brain. I he flat bones have two surfaces and a circum- ference, the first, accordingly as they are in- tended ^for muscular insertions, or merely co-

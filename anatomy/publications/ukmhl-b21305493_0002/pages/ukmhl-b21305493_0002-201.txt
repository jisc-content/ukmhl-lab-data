159 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. cricoid cartilage produces a similar phenomenon : pressed against the sides of the abdomen, the car- tilages of the lower ribs re-assume their former position, &c. &c. All these phenomena are evidently the result of the elastic power. Thus has nature always placed cartilages where, to answer particular pur- poses, it is requisite that the physical should be associated with the vital powers; as in the larynx, and in the nasal partition, to produce a kind of vi- bration in the passage of air ; in the ends of the ribs, to support that kind of tortion indispensable to mechanical respiration ; in the articulating extremities, to paralyze the effects of external violence. It appears that vital activity gives this pro- perty more energy, although it still remains very apparent after death. I presume the cartilages are indebted for this, to the great quantity of ge- latine they contain. 1st, It is sufficiently known that this substance is possessed of it in the highest degree, as is proved by the shaking of jellies that are coagulated by cold, by the inspection of dif- ferent animal glues, &c. 2dly, If by ebullition the cartilages are deprived of this substance, the nutritive parenchyma remains flabby and soft. 3dly, In proportion as organs are deprived of ge- latine, their elasticity is diminished, as is seen by studying the decay of this property in cartilages, wherein it predominates; in the fibro-cartilagin-

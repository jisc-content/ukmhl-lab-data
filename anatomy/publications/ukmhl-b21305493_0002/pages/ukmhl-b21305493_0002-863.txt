831 DEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. may be produced in three different ways; 1st. Bv transudation; 2dly. By secretion; 3dly. By exhalation. Some have admitted, that the subcutaneous fat transudes through the pores; but the scrotum, in which this substance is entirely wanting, ranks first amongst the greasy parts. The skin of the cranium, excessively oily, hardly contains any fat at all. That part covering the cheeks which possesses abundance of fat, is scarcely lubricated by it, &c. In the emaciated subject, the skin is fre- quently as unctuous as in the corpulent one ; this, however, is not invariably the case. To conclude : it is obvious that, in all the other functions, fluids do not transude. Is this an exception? Those who pretend that the cutaneous oil is secreted, (and they form the majority) place its source in small glands which they term sebaceous, and which, in their opinion, are everywhere ex- tended under the skin. A few small tubercles are actually observed on the convexity of the ear, on the nose, &c., but in almost every other part nothing is observable; a few very small promi- nences only, which I have already mentioned, are seen, and cause the roughness of the skin, but they have nothing to do with these glands. I do not, however, pretend to deny that they exist, but I could never observe the slightest appearance of them in my repeated experiments. This induces me to believe that there is pro-

MUSCULAR SYSTEM 268 MUSCULAR SYSTEM OF ANIMAL LIFE. * The general muscular system is evidently di- vided into two parts, essentially differing from each other in the vital powers, by which they are animated, in their exterior forms, their mode of organization, and above all, in the func- tions they fulfil; the one in animal life, the other in the organic life. We shall consider them se- parately. Let us begin with the muscles of ani- mal life: these are distributed with profusion in the human body, and no other system occupies more space in the economy. Besides the numerous re- gions that are over-run with muscles, they are extensively distributed under the skin, sharing, as it were, the functions of that organ, protecting, like the latter, the subjacent parts; and similar to it also, enduring external mechanical action, admitting even of being divided to a greater or less extent, without the general functions of life being essentially injured ; by which it is well adapted to protect the organs deeply situate, the injuries of which might be attended with dread- ful consequences.

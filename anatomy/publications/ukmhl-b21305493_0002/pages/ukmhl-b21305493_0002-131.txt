OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 89 mediately from the white fluids, since the vessels of the tendons, cartilages, and the other parts that are sustained by it, do not evidently, at least in their natural state, admit any red globules, and that every thing therein circulated, is apparently white. The formation of bone commences towards the end of the first month, in the clavicle, the ribs, &c.; it is rather more retarded in the other bones: its progress in the three species is as fol- lows.â€” Progress of Ossification in the Long Bones. First, in the middle of these bones there is a small bony cylinder, very thin in the centre, gra- dually assuming a trumpet-like form towards the ends, leaving a space in its interior for the rudi- ments of the medullary system, and perforated very obviously to receive the large nutritious vessel. This ossified cylinder, at first very thin, when compared with the cartilaginous ends of the bones, evidently disproportionate in this respect, and composed of very minute fibres, progressively in- creases both in bulk and length, and finally, draws towards the ends, where it reaches at the time of birth ; at this time, the greatest part of the heads are not yet ossified; soon after, at an epoch that varies according to the different species of bones, an ossified dot, constantly preceded by the ad-

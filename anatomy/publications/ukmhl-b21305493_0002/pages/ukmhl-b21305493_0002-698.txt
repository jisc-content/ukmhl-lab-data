SYNOVIAL SYSTEM* 656 consequently, from the separation of their arti- cular surfaces, as well as from flexion. The pree- ternatural collection of the synovial fluid in the tendinous sheaths constitute a species of dropsy, which has been termed ganglion, a tumour never observed in the synovial membranes of the fin- gers, no doubt from a want of extensibility in the fibrous capsules. It must not be thought, how- 'y VyL/yW # ever, that we rid ourselves of all these tumours on bursting them by a strong compression, and by thus forcing their fluid in the cellular tissue, contain true synovia, most generally they are accidental; they are as many cysts formed in the cellular tissue. In fact, these tumours are fre- quently observed over the tract of the great ex- tensor of the thumb, where there is no synovial membrane. Subsequent to rheumatic pains, I have witnessed a considerable collection of fluid in tile small synovial membrane of the tendo- achilles ; it disappeared by degrees. I have wit- nessed another similar to it in the bag of the psoas muscle of a corpse ; the fluid had a reddish appearance, and was as consistent as current jelly. By the action of nitric acid, it was instantly co- agulated into a whitish mass, similar to the white of a hard-boiled egg. The adherent surface of the synovial sheaths form, 1st. On one part, over the tendons, with which they are more or less intimately united They admit of being easily removed from over

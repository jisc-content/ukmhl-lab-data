190 FIBROUS SYSTEM. In general, the fibrous tissue affords less resist- ance to putrefaction than the cartilaginous, but much more than the medullary, the cutaneous, the mucous systems, &c. Amidst the putrefied and disorganized tissues in our dissecting-rooms, it is still found uninjured; finally, it undergoes the same change. The water in which it has been macerated, gives a less offensive smell than that used for the greatest part of the other systems. Easier of digestion than cartilages and fibro- cartilages, the fibrous tissue is less so than several others, as Spallanzani and Gosse have prov- ed by their experiments. It appears to be acted upon by the gastric juices, in the same order as in maceration and ebullition. These orders are, Istly. The tendons; Qdly. The apo- neuroses ; 3dly. The different fibrous membranes; 4thly. The ligaments, that are the hardest of diges- tion. I must remark, however, that when once the fibrous tissue has been softened by concoction, these different organs are digested with nearly the same facility. Thus are cartilages, when they have become gelatinous, as easily digested as tendons, and even more so, as Spallanzani has proved by trying the experiment upon himself; although they are much more indigestible, being raw.

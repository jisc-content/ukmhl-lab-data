Authors have been too much in the habit of generalizing facts observed under particular circumstances. From this a multiplicity of erro- neous consequences have been deduced. Sympathies. No organs are so readily influenced by the others as the organic muscles, but not all in the same degree. The heart in this respect is first in rank, next comes the stomach, afterwards the in- testines, and, finally, the bladder. This influence will now be examined. It is a remarkable phenomenon, that every af- fection at all powerful in the economy will in- stantly affect the motions of the heart. The slightest wound, the least pain, is sufficient to disturb this organ. Now there are two species of these disturbances: sometimes its action is momentarily obstructed ; hence syncopies, a mode of derangement very common in violent and s'udden pains.

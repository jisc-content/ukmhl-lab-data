Besides, a thousand causes, in the course of life, will produce varieties in the state of the mucous system. In two different subjects it never dis- plays the same shade, the same degree of density, the same exterior appearance; on taking any portion whatever from several subjects, that of the stomach for instance, these distinctions are ob- vious ; distinctions which are very striking even to those who are but little accustomed to dis- r section. Until the age of thirty, the mucous tissue is of a very bright red colour, afterwards it begins to fade. As we advance in years it gradually be- comes paler, a small quantity of blood only being conveyed to it; and it acquires additional degrees of consistence and density. By passing the fingers over it, that pleasing softness, once so very re- markable, is no longer felt. Its powers become languid, and this explains why the emission of fluids that cross the excretory ducts, to be ex- pelled outwardly, is attended with difficulty.

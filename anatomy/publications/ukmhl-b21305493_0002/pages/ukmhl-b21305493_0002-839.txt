Alkalies in general ap- pear to act quite differently during life, and even their action seems to vary according to the diffe- rent degrees of vitality. Flabby and fungous parts are not, as is well known, so easily burnt as quick and living parts ; the very same thing is observed in respect to acids. During life they never produce any thing similar to that pulp, va- rying in colour according to the agent used, and which after death is the invariable result of their action. It is well known that a solution of alkali, in contact with the skin, will produce, as is ascer- tained by the touch, a kind of unctuous and greasy substance, proceeding, no doubt, from a combi- nation of the alkali with the oily fluid of the skin, from which a kind of soapy substance is formed. I shall omit speaking of the remarkable ten- dency the dermis has to combine itself with tannin, and of the phenomena resulting from such combination, it would only be repeating what has already been stated on this head. I shall merely remark, that it might be an object of some importance to admit the extensive sub- cutaneous aponeuroses to this process, the tissue of which being essentially of a gelatinous nature, has the utmost analogy with that of the dermis, and which, considering their extent and tenuity, might probably be converted into uses for which

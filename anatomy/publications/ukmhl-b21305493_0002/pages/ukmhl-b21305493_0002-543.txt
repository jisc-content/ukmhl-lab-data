MUCOUS SYSTEM. 501 from the admission of air to the pleura, &c. The dangers attending the action of this fluid upon these organs, may have been too much exagge- rated, but they are nevertheless real. Whenever a fistula penetrates the intestines, its whole course is covered with callosities, by which the cellular tissue, and the muscles that cross the fistula, are protected. Nothing similar to this, on the contrary, is ever observed over the . mucous surface of the intestines, because its orga- nization alone is sufficient to protect it. The urinary, salivary and lachrymal fluids will never flow outwardly through artificial passages in the adjacent organs, without' similar callosities form in the course of these ducts; on the contrary, they traverse the mucous surfaces with impunity. If with a cutting instrument, we make a long, nar- row opening in one of the extremities, and fix a tube within it, the presence of the instrument will produce a canal formed of callosities; but if, on _ â€¢ the contrary, a bougie be retained in the urethra, no alteration in the tissue will take place. From these considerations, let us conclude that the mucous system only, in common, however, with the cutaneous, is so organized as to bear the contact of all exterior forms, and not to be affected by their presence, or at least to experi- ence from it only an increase of secretion wholly unattended with danger. Thus these two systems form two limits, the one internal, the other ex- 9 teinal, limits between which the organs, foreign

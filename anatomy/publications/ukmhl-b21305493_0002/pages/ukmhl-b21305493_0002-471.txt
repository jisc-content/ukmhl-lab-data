OF ORGANIC LIFE. 4 29 sphincter, which is a voluntary muscle, happens to be paralyzed, incontinence is the result, because there is no resistance opposed to the tendency of the rectum to contract, a tendency rather inef- fectual as long as this organ is filled. From all this it is evident, that although the bladder and the rectum receive cerebral nerves, these organs, however, are less influenced by the brain than might at first be supposed, and that there is between them and the voluntary muscles a very essential distinction : they do not partake of the properties of both, but might be much better assimilated to the organic muscles than to the others. I even much doubt whether we could contract them voluntarily if no collateral power were afforded from the nerves of the sa- cral plexuses. I have never seen an animal expel his faeces when the abdomen was open. From all that has hitherto been stated, we may conclude that the cerebral nerves which resort to the organic muscles possess over them an influ- ence that cannot be assimilated to that of the ce- rebral nerves upon the muscles of animal life. I have no further knowledge of the nature of this influence. Every organic muscle receives nerves from the ganglions, either the preceding, which are also penetrated by the cerebral, or the small intestines, the ccecum, the colon, &c. which are exclusively

If mace- ration and boiling do not render the nails less firm and adherent, as when they act upon the epidermis, it is because they are more solid. 6thly. I have obtained from the action of nitric and sulphuric acids, &c., upon these organs, nearly the same results as observed in the epidermis. Every thing then seems to concur to establish the utmost analogy in composition, organization, and properties between the nails and the epider- mis ; most undoubtedly there must exist some distinctions between their respective principles, since their appearances are not the same; since, although several sheets of epidermis are placed together, as in the sole of the foot and palm of the hand, yet the form and texture peculiar to nails is never observed, so that these cannot be considered altogether as mere sheets of epi- dermis applied together. It remains for chy- mistry to mark these differences which must certainly be very slight. Thus is nature often seen using these two organs with equal success for the very same purposes: thus it is, the feet of man and the approaching species, are protected by a thick epidermis, whilst in the cloven-footed species, they are lined with a horny substance, similar to the human nail.

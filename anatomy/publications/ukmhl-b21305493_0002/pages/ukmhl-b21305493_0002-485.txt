OF ORGANIC LIFE. 443 the muscles obey the exciting agents with the ut- most punctuality ; the bladder does not retain urine long; children expel it involuntarily during sleep ; the heart contracts with a rapidity pro- claimed by the pulse; all the phenomena of di- gestion are more rapidly performed; hence a shorter interval before the return of hunger : this is a phenomenon analogous with that of the vo- luntary muscles, in which the rapidity of the mo- tions is allied (in the early stage of life) with a deficiency of strength. Subsequent to infancy, the readiness with which the muscles answer their stimulants progressively decreases : hence all the important phenomena of organic life gradually decline. The number of pulsations, the time required for digestion, for retention of the urine, &c. are the thermometers of that decline. In the aged subject, ail the powers are weak- ened ; the action of the organic muscles gradually fade away. Those of the bladder and of the rec- tum are the most liable to lose their contractile powers: hence the retention of urine, the very frequent appendage of old age ; hence again the accumulation of the faeces above the anus, which, like the former affection, although not sufficiently noticed by practitioners, is so common at that stage of life. The rich, who indulge them- selves in the luxuries of the table, are particu-

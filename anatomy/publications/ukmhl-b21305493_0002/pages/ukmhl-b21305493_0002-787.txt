Thus the outward as- pect of a subject, from which the skin has been removed, is very different from the appearance of a corpse. Every: where continuous, this envelopment is reflected through different apertures to the in- terior of the body, and affords an organ to the mucous system. The limits between these two systems are constantly traced by a reddish line; within this line is the mucous system, outwardly is that of the dermis.

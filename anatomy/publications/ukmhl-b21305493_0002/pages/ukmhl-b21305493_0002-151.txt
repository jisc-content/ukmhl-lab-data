109 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. i deavour to elucidate it better. There are two kinds of dentition, the one temporary, and re- stricted to the early stages of infancy, the other belongs to the whole of life ; each must be con- sidered previous to, during, and subsequent to, the protrusion. < The first Dentition previous to the appearance of the Teeth. The phenomena of dentition, previous to the period of protrusion, are as follows : the jaws of the foetus are closed all over their free ridge, they appear homogeneous at first sight; but when viewed internally, they display a number of small membranous follicles, divided by thin partitions situate in the sockets, in the same symmetrical or- der as the teeth, that will subsequently arise from them in the following manner. The membrane that envelopes the follicle forms a bag without any opening, that first lines the parieties of the alveolus, to which it adheres by ex- tensions : on reaching the part in which the ves- sels and nerves penetrate, it leaves the socket, frees itself, falls backward, forming a tube that attends the vascular and nervous bundle, and finally expands over the pulp of the tooth in which the bundle terminates.

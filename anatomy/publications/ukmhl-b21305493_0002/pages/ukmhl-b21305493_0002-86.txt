44 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. presents small reddish striae, that are nothing more than these small vessels still filled with blood, a more or less considerable number is thus ascertained, in proportion to the blood contained in the capillary system at the moment of death : 4th. The sawing of the compact tissue in living animals is tinged with red, less so, however, than that of the cancelli; a proof that a number of vessels have been injured by the saw. The vessels of the bones are uncommonly nu- merous in infants. Their number decreases in the adult and it is very much reduced on the decline of life. The facility that attends the formation of callus, follows the same proportion in the diffe- rent stages; sometimes, and even frequently, in the affections of the osseous parenchyma, they acquire a remarkable developement, such even as considerably to exceed the natural diameter. The osteo-sarcoma, and the spina-ventosa, display this disposition, which is more frequently observed to be the result of cancerous than of any other tumours. All these vessels communicate by multi- plied anastomoses: this is particularly observable in the long bones, between those of the medullary or- gan and those of the cancelli. By these communica- tions they act as substitutes to each other for their functions. In a body I was injecting, I found the nutritive foramen of the tibia completely ob- literated ; a kind of cartilage filled up the space, the artery being nothing more than a real liga-

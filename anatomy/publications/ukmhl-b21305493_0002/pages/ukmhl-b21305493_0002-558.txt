Over the tongue these small nervous projec lions are rather distinct and tolerably distant from each other. In the fossee nasales, stomach, and intestines, they are so close to each other, and at the same time so very minute, that the mem- brane bears at first glance an uniform aspect, smooth as it were, although covered with these projections. Each papilla is formed of a single body ; their extremities are never seen divided. All apparently have a pyramidal form, if we are to judge of all by the most sensitive. Do they admit of a kind of erection ? This opinion has prevailed in regard to those of the tongue, which are said to rise to perceive fla- vours; in respect to those of the nose, which in this state of erection are supposed more effec- tually to receive odours, &c.: this, in respect to the phenomena of sensation, is, on a small scale, what the erection of the corpus'cavernosum is on a more extensive one. I do not believe this fact could possibly be proved by any experiment: besides, it should then follow that the papillae of the intestines and bladder are in a permanent state of erection, since they are almost always in contact with foreign substances.

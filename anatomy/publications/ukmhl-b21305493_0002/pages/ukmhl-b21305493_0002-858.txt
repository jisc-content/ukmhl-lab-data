I must, however, con- fess, that this important point, which I intend to elucidate next winter, is unsupported by experi- mental observation; lam even inclined to believe that many coughs originate from it: in fact, a number of those principles rejected by the mucous surfaces of the bronchia, differing from their aqueous vehicle, and not being taken up by the air, stagnate upon these surfaces, irritate them, and produce the cough by which they are expelled. This accounts for the frequency of coughs in winter, as well as for the inclination to bathe, ex- perienced in summer, in consequence of the saline substances that are accumulated upon the skin by exhalation, being, as I have said before, insoluble in air. This also explains how, in a number of affections of the lungs, in which the mucous glands and the exhalents of the bronchia do not increase the quantity of fluid generally shed by these organs, but merely separate with this hu- mour, in consequence of the change of their or- ganic sensibility, substances in air cannot possibly dissolve. Thus I say it is explained how such af- fections are attended with habitual cough ; for, as I have already stated, the moment any sub- stance stagnates for some time upon the mucous system, it will irritate it, and stimulate the surface to rid itself of it. Such, in my opinion, is a sketch tending to elucidate the origin of several coughs, which, considering the insufficiency of

667 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. interstices; it strongly resembles the sub-mucous tissue, that exterior to arteries, veins, and to the excretory organs, &c. but it does not possess the same degree of resistance. It is rarely permeated with fat, and forms a kind of membrane, which, insulating in some degree the vitality of the gland, answers in a great part to the functions of the peritoneum round the liver, of the membrane proper to the kidneys, spleen, &c. ARTICLE II. Organization of the Glandular System. SECTION i. Tissue proper to the Organization of that System. The glandular tissue is distinct from the greater part of the others, inasmuch as it has nothing of a fibrous structure. The elements it is composed of are not placed next to each other, following longi- tudinal or oblique directions; as in the muscles, fibrous bodies, the bones, nerves, &c. they are conglomerated, united by cellular tissue, and very slightly adherent. Thus whilst organs, with very distinct fibres, present considerable resistance, especially in the direction of their fibres, these will lacerate at the slightest attempt, and even part with the utmost facility. The edges of the division are uneven and thready, a difference by

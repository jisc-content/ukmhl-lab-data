, OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 99 / ixient of granulations ; 2dly, the transformation into a cartilage ; 3dly,the change of this cartilage into solid bone. This threefold phenomenon re- quires a space of time, that varies, according to the age of the subject, the nature of the fracture, and the species of bone, &c., but which generally requires more time than any other kind of cica- trization. The formation of granulations is a phenomenon common to every kind of organ that has been di- vided, when the edges of the division are not in immediate contact; here granulations arise from all the parts of the divided surface, from the pe- riosteum, from the compact tissue, and particularly from the cancelli. Those from one side meet and unite with those of the opposite one, and so far the cicatrization of bones differs in no respect from that of every other part. This state cor- responds with the mucous state of natural ossi- fication. As granulations are nothing but an ex- tension of the parenchyma of nutrition, they are possessed of the same vital powers,and their organic sensibility follows the same laws as in common nutrition ; it first becomes connected with gela- tine; this substance, consequently, is exhaled in it; then begins the cartilaginous state : then the cicatrization of the bone assumes a peculiar cha- racter, that distinguishes it from that of all other organs. u 3

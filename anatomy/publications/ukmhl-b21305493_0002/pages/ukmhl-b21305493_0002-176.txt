MEDULLARY SYSTEM* VM of that tissue : it cannot he referred to any of the three classes of the serous, fibrous or mucous sur- faces. Some authors have asserted that it is an expansion of the periosteum that insinuates itself through the numerous pores with which the bone is pierced as it were, and penetrates the medul- lary cavity ; but the slightest comparison between these membranes, is sufficient to show that es- sentially differing in their functions, their vital powers, &c., they cannot be possessed of the same tissue. A principal vessel penetrates the medullary membrane ; it is the artery that enters through the single but striking aperture observed in the body of the long bones; the two branches of this ar- tery, and those of the corresponding vein, ramify in reverse directions over the medullary cylinder, and by the innumerable quantity of their ramus- culee, give it a reddish appearance, that fades with age. The ends borrow their vessels from those of the adjacent cancelli; no nerve can be followed there. Such is, sometimes, the abund- ance of fluids with which this membrane is per- meated, and its excessive tenuity, that its ex- istence might actually be doubted ; to be con- vinced of the contrary, however, only expose the cylinder it forms to a high degree of caloric ; it will instantly shrink and contract in the same manner as every other solid, and will become more conspicuous.

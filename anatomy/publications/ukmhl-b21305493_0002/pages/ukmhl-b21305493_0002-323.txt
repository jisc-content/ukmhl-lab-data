OF ANIMAL LIFE. 281 Let us remark that few muscles in the economy are interposed between two such powerful levers, consequently not liable to be so excessively dis- tended, and particularly by a power much supe- rior to that of their contraction; for every mus- cular rupture naturally supposes an excess of ex- ternal motion, that distends over that of the fleshy fibres, which contract to resist the distension. If external efforts were concentrated in a single muscle, they would more frequently overcome the resistance ; but in general, several partake in the effort to support, and in the resistance to be opposed. Composition of the Muscular Tissue. The muscular tissue has been for the chemist a more especial object of study, than the greatest number of the other organic tissues. It has been examined in every way. I shall refer to the works of chemistry, particularly to that of Fourcroy, for all that does not strictly relate to the nature of the tissue ; for all that may regard the conse- quences inapplicable to physiology, and that may be drawn from a knowledge of the principles which may constitute its component parts. Exposed to the action of air, the muscular tis- sue is acted upon in two different ways; 1st. If cut in thin slices it dries, admitting of a quick evaporation of the fluids it contains. It is then of a dark brown colour ; its fibres are compressed

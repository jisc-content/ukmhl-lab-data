At one period the heart is undoubtedly red, dense, voluminous, and well nourished in the same subject; or feeble, pale, and less voluminous at another, according to the circumstances by which he is influenced ; for the internal organs necessarily undergo the same al- terations we observe in the external ones, and we are well aware how very frequent these changes are during life. SECTION VI. State of the Organic Muscular System in Old Age. In proportion as age advances, the muscular system, we are now considering, decays like every other; its action, however, is rather longer con- tinued, it survives the other, as it were. When i the aged subject can no longer move without dif- ficulty, his pulse, digestion, &c. still retain some energy. This distinction between the two sys- tems is so much the more remarkable, that the duration of activity in the one is reduced to nearly half to that of the other ; sleep, in fact, suppresses half of the period of motion in the vo- luntary motions, whilst it has no influence upon the others. This phenomenon of one muscular sys- tem surviving the other, as it were, at the decline of life, depends upon the same principle from

GLANDULAR SYSTEM. G69 mucous glands, present a soft parenchyma, pul- pous, as it were, without the slightest appearance of lobes or grains of any description whatever. The slightest glance at the glandular system is sufficient to convince of the threefold and im- portant distinction I have pointed out. The testes and the mammae have a peculiar texture that has no reference to these distinctions. Authors have been actively engaged concern- ing the intimate structure of glands. Malpighy admitted in them, of small bodies, of a peculiar nature as he thought. Ruysch stated that they were all vascular. Let us throw aside all these idle questions, unsupported by inspection or ex- periment. Let us study anatomy, where it comes within the reach of our senses. The strict study of sciences will not in the pressure of age accord with a heap of hypotheses which in the last cen^ tury made general anatomy and physiology a frivolous novel. There is not the slightest doubt that the ex- cretory organs communicate with the arteries that penetrate the glands. Fluids injected into the latter readily escape through the former, without leaving in the gland the slightest mark of extravasation. Pure blood is frequently seen to flow from the excretory ducts, and to form sometimes bloody urine, at other times a bloody saliva, &c. But do these facts prove there is nothing more than vessels in glands; that the

884' EPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. were. 3dly. Whenever the epidermis is at all elevated, the slightest friction will raise it en- tirely in those parts. Thus subsequent to dry friction, if considerable, a rough skin becomes scaly, whilst a smooth one will undergo no alte- ration. It is even this that, in common with the outward appearance, so powerfully contributes to the imperfection of the one, and to the beauty of the other. 4thly. Subsequent to violent fevers, and even to several affections of the internal vis- cera, the skin that has been sympathetically affected by the disease, has become the seat of an affection which, without any outward manifesta- tion, has yet been never sufficient to separate it from the epidermis, which is elevated in all di- rections. 5thly. Blistering, as is well known, by which a considerable quantity of serum is drawn to the external, surface of the corium, drys up the exhalents that cross from this membrane to the epidermis, so that this serum is effected under the latter, and forms a considerable collection. Water will not ooze through the open pores, owing to their parietes being collapsed by their oblique insertion through the epidermis, the pres- sure of the water itself stopping up the passage; for the very same reason an isolated portion of the epidermis will receive and contain mercury with- out suffering its particles to infiltrate through the pores, although, as I have previously stated, these pores are remarkably obvious when that

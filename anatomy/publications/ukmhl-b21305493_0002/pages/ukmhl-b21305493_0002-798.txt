756 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. as those in which they cannot possibly be traced ; it is by maceration. This is even the best way to obtain a correct view of the dermoidal tex- ture. In fact, when the skin has remained in the water for some time, it softens, the fibres of its corium separate, and their interstices become more distinct; then the areolae are not only met with in the internal surface, but they are seen extended throughout its tissue, which really re- presents a sieve-like body in its whole thickness, so excessively numerous are the interstices left between the fibres. These areolae do not assume a bag-like form towards the external surface; they open upon their surface by a multiplicity of apertures, very apparent when the skin has macerated for a month or two, but which in the natural state are hardly perceptible in some subjects, and very distinct in others. Besides, to investigate them, requires that the epidermis be removed. Now since to effect this instantly, we generally make use of boiling water, or of a quick fire, the tissue of the dermis shrinks, and they are thus made much less ap- parent, whilst on the contrary the skin is not contracted by maceration, but dilated and ex- panded, by which means the apertures are most evidently displayed. In certain parts, and in par- ticular subjects, they will admit of the head of a pin being introduced; in others they are less striking. They never cross the dermis in a per-

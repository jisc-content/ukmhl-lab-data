404 MUSCULAR SYSTEM longs to it moulds itself upon the form of the viscus it contributes to form. The organic mus- cles, in fact, are not formed in isolated skains, like those of animal life. None except the heart contribute more than a third, a quarter, and even less, in the formation of a viscus. The greatest part are of a thin, flat, and mem- branous form ; they are in layers of divers widths, and hardly ever in distinct bundles. Si- tuate next to each other, the fibres are not often placed above : hence it follows, that these mus- cles being of a very considerable extent, are still not very voluminous. The gluteus major alone would be more considerable than all the fibres of the stomach, intestines, and the bladder, if, like this, they were united into a thick and square mass. ARTICLE II. Organization of the Muscular System of Organic Life. The organization of the involuntary muscles is not quite so uniform as that of the preceding. Allowing for the distinctions observed in these, for the proportion of the fleshy fibres over the tendinous, the length of the first, for the thick- ness of their bundles, and for their assemblage in flat, long, and short muscles, every thing is per-

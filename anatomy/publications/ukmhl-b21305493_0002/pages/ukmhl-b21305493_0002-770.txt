There are a variety of other instances in which its use would prove most bene- ficial, as in certain cases of head-ache, in remittent fevers, in some cases of apoplexy, in the different comatose affections, &c. Blistering requires some time before it operates; four, five, six hours even will elapse before any irritation can possibly be produced. Who is not aware that frequently, even in diseases attended with great prostration of strength, its action upon the cutaneous system is perfectly null ? The excitement of the pituitary membrane, on the contrary, by ammonia, is con- stantly sudden, and infallibly effectual.

The agency of ammonia, or of any other powerful stimulant, applied to the pituitary membrane, might be re- peated every fifteen minutes, every five or six minutes, even every minute in short.

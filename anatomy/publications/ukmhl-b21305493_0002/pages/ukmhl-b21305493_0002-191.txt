CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 149 sensation of which would be painful in the ex- tensive motions, if the bones preserved their so- lidity at the end of the lever they represent. The forms of the cartilages we are examining, besides these general characters, have others that are peculiar to each kind of moveable articula- tion. 1st. In the first genus, the convex crust that covers the head of the bone is thick in the centre, and very thin in the circumference. An inverse disposition is observed in the concave part that receives the insertion ; frequently, even as in the humerus, in the femur, the thickness is increased at the circumference by a cushion-like fibro-cartilage. In this manner the effort is unequally borne in the different parts by one or other of the cartilages, but the uniformity of the contact is secured. 2dly. In the second genus, that differs from the first, by its being deprived of the motion of rota- tion, as a convexity is generally received into a concavity, the disposition is nearly the same for the two cartilages. However, if two convex sur- faces glide the one over the other, as the condyle of the jaw, and the transverse apophysis afford instances of, then the cartilage gradually decreases in the circumference of each, but an inter-ar-> ticulating cartilage, thin in the middle, thick in the circumference, supplies the deficiency, and establishes in every point a contact which, with-

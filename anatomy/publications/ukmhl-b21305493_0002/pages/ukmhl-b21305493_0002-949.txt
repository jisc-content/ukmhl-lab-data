EPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 90? tend to sav what is the nature of these mem- branes ; but authors agree in general in ascribing to them a soft and pulpy nature, which does not appear to accord with that we have described in the epidermis. In the Hotel Dieu, I have often noticed whitish membranes removed from the oesophagus, subsequent to poisoning by nitric acid. But these membranes evidently are the superficial part of the mucous organ, which being disorganized is expelled by the suppuration that has formed under it. It is thus, that the cutane- ous eschars drop in the form of a membrane; thus are formed the osseous sheets in necrossis, and which are nothing more than the surface of the bone that dies, and is separated in a lamellat- ed form. Hence the existence of an epidermis in the deep-seated mucous surfaces appears to me very doubtful, and could not be admitted without further considerations, and those, I think, will prove more against than in favour of this opinion. Where does the epidermis that lines the origin of the mucous surfaces terminate, or if continued throughout, where does its existence cease to be ascertained by the action of the different re- agents ? In my opinion, it is impossible fully to elucidate this question ; this membrane gradually dies away and becomes imperceptible.

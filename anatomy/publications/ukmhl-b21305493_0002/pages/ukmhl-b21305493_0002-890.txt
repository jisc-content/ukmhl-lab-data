DEKMOIDA 1, SYSTEM. S48 sympathetically produced, and arise from the con- nexions between the healthy organ and the diseased part ? I have alluded to those of the skin and the ,mucous surfaces : with the membrane that lines the stomach they have a particular sym- , patliy. This is exemplified by the phenomena attending digestion. To enumerate all the sym- pathies to which this organ is liable, would re- quire a minute description of every disease. These at times assume a chronic type. How, then, in a number of organic diseases, divers tumours, &c. do sympathies affect the skin ? Precisely in the same manner as petechiee, miliary eruptions, &c. are produced in acute fevers : the only difference is in the duration of the sympathetic phenomena. It is obvious that animal contractility and sen- sible organic contractility cannot possibly be ex- cited in the passive sympathies of the skin, since this organ is denied these properties. Active Sympathies. Each of the four divisions of cutaneous affec- tions we have been viewing, gives rise to a multi- plicity of sympathetic phenomena, of which the following are instances. 1st. Whenever the papillae are strongly ex- cited, as by tickling in persons susceptible of very lively sensations, various organs will be sympathetically affected: sometimes it is the heart, hence syncopies ensue ; at other times it ia

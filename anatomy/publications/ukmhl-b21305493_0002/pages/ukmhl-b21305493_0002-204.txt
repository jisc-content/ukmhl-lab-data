162 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. perience little alteration ; for instance, if we only compare the corpse of an individual that has suffered violent death, whose organs have remain- ed uninjured, and that of a consumptive, dropsi- cal, or cancerous subject, &c., we shall find, be- tween nearly all the organs of the one, and those of the other, a very striking distinction : the as- pect of the muscles, of the mucous and serous sur- faces, of the vessels, of the nerves, &c., is com- pletely changed by the slow alteration they have undergone in the latter; but amidst all these al - terations, the cartilages have hardly undergone any; their aspect is nearly the same as in their natural state. Characters of the Vital Properties. From what has just been stated, it will be con- ceived that cartilages do not possess much vital activity ; that every morbid phenomenon must, in these organs, be characterized by a remarkably slow progress ; that inflammation, for instance, must, as in bones, assume a chronic type. The following experiment clearly establishes this point. If a cartilage be laid completely bare, divided, and then brought in contact with apart of a muscle, of the skin, &c., that has also been divided, union will not be effected, or at least will require a considerable lapse of time. Why ? Because the vitality of the muscle or of the skin,

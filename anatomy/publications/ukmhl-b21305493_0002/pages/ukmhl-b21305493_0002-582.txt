MUCOUS SYSTEM. 540 contact of that gas upon the membrane, but from the intrusion of the veinous circulation into the ar- terial system, as has been demonstrated, I believe, by my experiments; Finally, if it be re- marked, that in these various circumstances, the livid appearance of the mucous membranes by the veinous circulation, is not altered after death, although the skin is then more easily permeated with any kind of aerial fluid ; we shall find we ought to suspend our judgment respecting the colouring of the blood through the mucous mem- branes, until the question be elucidated by further observations. What follows, is another experiment that may throw some light on this point. I have filled the peritoneal cavity of several guinea-pigs with car- bonic acid gas, with hydrogen, with oxygen and atmospheric air, to try if I could obtain, through a serous membrane, the result that had failed in a mucous membrane ; subsequent to these experi- ments, I found no difference in the colour of the blood of the abdominal system ; it was similar to that of the common guinea-pig I had killed for the sake of comparison. I have often remarked, either in frogs, or in animals possessed of red and warm blood, as cats and guinea-pigs, that the blood, after some time, acquires a brighter red from the cellular tissue being permeated with oxygen, than it is observed to possess in artificial emphysema, pro-

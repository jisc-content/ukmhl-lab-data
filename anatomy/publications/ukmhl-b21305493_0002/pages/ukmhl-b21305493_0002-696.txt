SYNOVIA fj SYSTEM. 65 4 the fernoro-tibiai articulation ; it is the very same membrane belonging at the same time both to the tendon and to the articulation. Another re- markable instance is observed in respect to the extensors of the leg, and the popliteus, for the tendons of which the synovial membrane of the knee serves as a capsule, &c. Very few synovial grooves are observed in the trunk ; almost all of them are placed in the limbs, where they are intended for the gliding of ten- dons. They are seen, 1st. There where a tendon is reflected by an angle over a bone, as round those of the peroneus longus, the peroneus medius of the internal obturator, of the great oblique of the eye, &c,; 2dlv. Wherever a tendon glides over a bony surface without being reflected, as at the extremity of the tendo-achilles, as under that of the gluteus magnus of the united tendons of the iliacus internus, and psoas muscles, &c.; where a tendon glides in a fibrous capsule, as in those of every flexor, &c. their extent is in- variably proportioned to that of the tendons over which they are formed. Forms— Connections—Synovial Fluid. The synovial tendons are like those of the arti- cular, imperforated sacs, folded on one part over the tendon, and on the other over the adja- cent organs. These sacs are differently shaped,

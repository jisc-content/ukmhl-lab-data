GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 725 glands ; but the increased action of the lachrymal gland precedes, for some time, that of the latter. The application of stimulants to the mucous sur- faces cannot produce a catarrhal flux immediately. Second Character.â€”The Remittent State of the Glandular Action. The second character relative to the glands, is their liability to habitual and alternate increase and diminution. Sleep especially bears upon the animal functions; these only are completely sus- pended in the ordinary state, and this is what constitutes sleep. But the glands also rest in some degree, although the remission of action is never perfect, except in disease. I compare the sleep of animal life with the calm intervals of in- termittent fevers ; and the repose of the glands with those of remittent fevers, wherein the fit is only moderate, but uninterruptedly continued. Whenever food crosses the mouth, saliva is most abundantly supplied ; at any other time this cavity is only moistened. Whilst chyle is pass- ing into the duodenum, the pancreas and the liver pour out their fluids abundantly: they are also active, but much less so during hunger.

GLANDULAR SYSTEM, 671 When exposed to the air, so as not to dry, the glandular tissue yields rapidly to putrefaction : it has a more offensive smell than almost any other tissue. It appears to give out a greater quantity of ammonia. The liver particularly is the most foetid on putrefying. I know of no or- gan which, if macerated in water, will exhale a more insupportable smell. The kidneys do not putrefy quite so readily, but in this respect they are rather variable. In boiling, the glandular tissue produces at first an abundant quantity of greyish matter, at first perfectly mixed with the water, wnich is thick- ened by it, then collecting over its surface in abundance of scum. This tissue, the fleshy, the mucous, and the cellular tissues, yield the most of it by ebullition ; as the cartilaginous, the tendiÂ» nous, the aponeurotic, and the fibro-cartilaginous tissues, &c. give the least. Let it not be thought, however, that this preliminary produce of con- coction is every where uniform in its nature ; it varies according to each system, both in quality and quantity. At least I have observed , that its appearance was never the same, its property of yielding a scum is the most permanent; but even this is very variable, and frequently perfectly null in the mucous system, &c. The broth made by boiling is highly coloured, and apparently contains less principles than that proceeding from the white organs. A correct

SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 650 tant viscus, the skin, tiie mucous surfaces, the cellular tissue, the nerves, &c. &c., are more or less sympathetically agitated, the synovial mem- branes remain unmoved; they are not then found to be the seat of undefined pains, nor is their ex- halation more active or retarded. In this respect they are somewhat similar to the bony, the carti- laginous, and even to the fibrous systems, &e. Thus physicians should not look to the synovial system for those symptoms, which are indepen- dent of the injury the diseased organ itself has sustained, but to its connections with the other parts. In such pains as affect the articulations, there are undoubtedly cases in which the synovial mem- brane is diseased, and others wherein the fibrous organs are exclusively the seat of the disorder. The distinction of these cases is left for further research. Functions. The synovial membrane seems wholly uncon- nected with the solidity of the articulation. The fibrous capsules, and the lateral ligaments are exclusively intrusted with the care of securing it. The smooth surface, which the articular extremi- ties borrow from this membrane, facilitates their motions ; it may even facilitate muscular action. Thus the synovial portions situate behind the knee, in the elbow under the triceps, in the phalanges,

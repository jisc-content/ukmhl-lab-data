FIBROUS SYSTEM. 244 whole power of a muscle, frequently very large, on a small bony surface, and thence the extent and power of the motions of the bone, &c. The tendinous forms are generally cylindrical; undoubtedly, because, in this form there is more substance in less compass ; sometimes, however, as in the tendons of the extensors of the leg, and of the fore-arm, they are flattened. Sometimes the tendons are bifurcated, or divided into several secondary prolongations, at their in- sertion ; or they receive the fleshy fibres in two or even more different points. They are all co- vered with a loose tissue, that admits of their sliding over each other or the adjacent parts with facility. This tissue is sometimes wanting, then the synovial capsules surround them to facilitate their motions. The fleshy fibres pass in different directions toward the points of inser- tion ; sometimes they proceed from one side only, hence the semipenniform muscles ; at other times from both sides at the same time, consti- tuting the penniform muscles. Frequently the tendon imbedded in the centre cannot be laid bare but by a longitudinal section. The adherence between the fleshy fibre and the tendons is very great; however, by submitting them to maceration for some time, or on their undergoing ebullition, they will gradually sepa- rate from each other. I have observed, that in young subjects the adherence was by no means

Let it be remarked that all the whitish flakes, floating over that water, that the fake membranes which form in it, and the white fluids that thicken it, so even as to give it a milk-like appearance, appear to be nothing else than albumine in different degrees of consistence. It might be thought that the heat of inflammation has produced, during life, the same phenomenon as caloric produces on the white of egg, on the fluid of dropsies, &c. I shall pass unnoticed the other accessory principles which enter into the composition of the serous fluids. ARTICLE II. Organization of the Serous System, A whitish hue, shining not quite so bright as that of an aponeurosis; variable in thickness, ob- viously displayed in the liver, the heart, the intestines, &c., scarcely observable in the tunica arachnoides, the spleen, &c. ; a remarkable trans- parency whenever these membranes are removed in some considerable extent, or when thev are examined in parts; whereas in the spleen both their surfaces are free ; such are the primitive characters of their structure. All are composed of a single sheet, which

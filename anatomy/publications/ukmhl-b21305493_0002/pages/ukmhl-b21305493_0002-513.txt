OF ORGANIC LIFE. 471 being calculated to re-act after having been com- pressed by their want of elasticity, these sub- stances cannot possibly fulfil the same office as the antagonist. The greatest number of physiologists have ad- mitted, as a cause of dilatation, the admission of fresh substances which replace in the muscular cavities those expelled by contraction : thus the admission of new blood in the heart, that of food in the different parts of the alimentary tube have been considered to dilate these organs; so that by this opinion muscles would merely be passive on dilating. But the following considerations, of which some authors,â€™ particularly Grimaud, have already presented a few, do not allow of consi- dering the dilatation of organic muscles in this way, that of the heart in particular. 1st. When a hollow muscle is laid bare, as the heart, the stomach, or the intestines, &c. and the substances contained are completely with- drawn, if a stimulant be applied externally, it will alternately dilate and contract in the same manner as when it is filled ; 2dly. If on empty- ing, by puncture, all the large vessels that resort to the heart and those which proceed from it, and that organ be completely evacuated, its alternate dilatations and evacuations will still be continued for some time; 3dly. To judge comparatively of the degree of power of contraction and di- latation, let two hearts, nearly equal in size, be

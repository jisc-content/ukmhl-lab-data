In fact, first, its serous surface does not interfere with it, since it is of the very same nature as the whole remainder of the peri- toneum, and besides, in what is called enteritis, in which this serous membrane is especially affected, such frequent and varied sympathetic affections are not observed. 2dly.

It may con- tribute to them, but most undoubtedly the modi- fications it experiences in the mucous surface, and the peculiar nature of this membrane, must also be included. No membrane in the economy is organized like that of the stomach. Although we do not immediately perceive its organic dis- tinctions, a slight reflection will be sufficient to prove it, for none of the membranes separate such a considerable quantity of fluid, none sepa- rate fluids analogous to the gastric juices.

608 SEROUS SYSTEM. uses in respect to the organs it surrounds with a damp atmosphere. Blood Vessels. Are the blood vessels integral parts in the structure of the serous membranes? They are very numerous round these organs, as is seen in the peritoneum, the pericardium, the pleurae, &c., they twine on the external surface and ramify over it. But I have always doubted that the greatest num- ber of such as are thus contiguous to them formed integral parts of their tissue, I am even convinced of the contrary, and my opinion is supported by the following considerations: lstly. In cases where these vessels are injected, they are easily removed by the scalpel from the external surface of these membranes, without destroying their continuity, which can never be effected in the fibrous and mucous membranes: 2dly. On examining these membranes, where they are free in both their surfaces no blood vessel is seen. The tunica arach- noides in the basis of the skull affords an instance of it: 3dlv. The vessels frequently change their con- nections with these membranes. I have already proved that whenever the omentum is applied to the full stomach, the vessels contained between its layers do not draw up along with it over this viscus, because they are prevented by the great coronary branch. The vessels when injected are never seen to project as usual below the

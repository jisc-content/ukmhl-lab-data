In dropsies, on the contrary, produced from a disease of the tissue of the serous surfaces, from a tubercular inflammation for instance, or from acute inflammation, &c., that has degene- rated, the effused serum is generally adulterated ; it is either lactescent, or displays albuminous flakes, or a false membrane is the result, &c. This ob- servation, which I consider interesting, has struck me almost as frequently as I have opened subjects. In acute diseases also, the serous surfaces equally receive the sympathetic influence from the affected organs. If they could be seen then we should find them like the skin, more or less damp or dry, according to the different periods of the disease. The proof is, that at the time of death in which the disease terminates, the serum of the pleura, of the pericardium, of the peritoneum, &e.; varies in an astonishing degree. Sometimes it is obviously increased, at other times it is almost null: this depends upon the time when death took place. If at that time exhalation is very abundant, a quantity of serum is found ; hardly any is seen when life has been continued long enough for absorption to be effected. If the perspiration were not dissolved by the surrounding air, or if the skin were disposed in the form of a bag in the same manner as the serous surfaces, we should find it in very different degrees of mois-

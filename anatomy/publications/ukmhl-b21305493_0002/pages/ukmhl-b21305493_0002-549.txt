MUCOUS SYSTEM. 50? niventes are merely marked by a reddish line, without any apparent projection ; but if the in- testine, when in that state be submitted to mace- ration, the folds will again expand. On being exposed to damp air, or left amongst other animal remains that prevent it from dry- ing, the mucous corion very soon becomes putrid ; its smell in that state is very offensive. If the abdomen soon putrifies, it is not only owing, I should think, to its containing putrid substances, but also to the surfaces being in contact with those substances which, by their vitality, had so far resisted their influence. If these substances were contiguous to aponeurosis, putrefaction would not be near so rapid during this process: the mucous system first assumes a greyish hue; and as the subjacent dense cellular tissue requires much more time to putrify, this mucous corion can be elevated with the greatest facility, and re- duced to a putrid mass, in which there are no re- mains of organization. During life, the mucous tissue is in general less frequently affected with gangrene than the cutaneous tissue. The consequences attending catarrhs, compared with those of erysipelas, will convince us of this truth. There are instances, however, of this tissue becoming dead, whilst the surrounding parts continue to live, as in malig- nant sore throat. The mucous tissue readily yields. I even be-

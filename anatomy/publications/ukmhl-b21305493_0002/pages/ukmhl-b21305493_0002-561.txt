519 MUCOUS SYSTEM. of the trachea and bronchia were not increased in size, although, as it is well known, they are ra- ther conspicuous: the membrane alone seemed affected. Besides, the affections of these glands have not yet (as those of similar organs, more apparent from their volume) been properly in- vestigated. In general they assume a spherical form, but with innumerable varieties. They do not seem to be enveloped by any membrane whatever : like the salivary glands, and the pan- creatic, they are supported by cellular tissue. Their texture is tighter and denser than that of these last glands; they contain but little cellular tissue; they are soft and vascular, and on being opened, their appearance is nearly similar to that of the prostrate gland. I cannot tell if they con- tain any nerves; by analogy we must suppose it, for all the principal glands are supplied with these organs. Mucous Fluids. We are but imperfectly acquainted with the composition of the mucous fluids, because, in the natural state they cannot easily be collected, and in the morbid state, wherein their quantity is increased, as in catarrhs for instance, their com- position is probably altered. It is well known, that in general they are flat and insipid to the taste, not easily dissolved by water, even when that fluid is raised to a very high degree of tern-

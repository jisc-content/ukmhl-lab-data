368 MUSCULAR SYSTEM SECTION irr. Duration of the Contractions. In respect to the duration of contractions, there are in muscles very remarkable distinctions, ac- cordingly as these contractions have been artifi- cially or naturally produced. If in a living animal, or in one recently killed, the muscle itself, or its nerves, be stimulated, re- laxation will almost immediately succeed to con- traction, but neither of these states will be of any duration; for whatever length of time the excite- ment is continued, the effect produced is instantly exhausted. If galvanism, or mechanical and che- mical agents, be selected for experiments, the phenomenon will be the same. When, on the contrary, the contraction is di- rected by the will, it may be continued for a con- siderable time. The position, &c. in supporting burdens, evidently prove this fact; even when during life, a morbid irritation acts upon the nerves, the contraction may continue, dreadful instances of which we find in tetanus. A permanent state of contraction will fatigue the muscle much more than alternate contrac- tions and relaxations: this explains why, when- ever a stationary position is long continued, we alternately bring the body to bear more upon one limb than upon the other.

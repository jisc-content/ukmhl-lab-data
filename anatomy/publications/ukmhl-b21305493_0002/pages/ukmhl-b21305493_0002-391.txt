OF ANIMAL LIFE. 349 proportion, as we recede from the moment of death. A muscle is never left wholly insensible to stimulants, as is frequently the case during life. This essential distinction, too long over- looked by authors, and which I have frequently verified on different animals, proceeds from the effects of the nervous influence which, during life, opposes that of the stimulant; for instance, if an animal extend the thigh, the action cannot be counterpoised by laying bare, and it will be to no purpose exciting the antagonist muscles. The influence of the brain upon the extensors being more powerful than the mechanical irrita- tion of the flexors, the former have the advan- tage. During the application of the stimulant, the brain often acts powerfully upon the muscles, and the effect more than counterbalances that artificially produced. This appears surprising, but our surprise ceases if we consider that there are two distinct exciting causes ; namely, that of the external agent and that of the brain. In general, those who have tried experiments upon living animals, have not paid sufficient attention to this concurrence of two different powers. In order to estimate correctly sensible organic contractility, the animal sensibility should be de- stroyed; for as long as they are simultaneously ex- cited, they check, and counterbalance each other, and it is impossible to ascertain accurately what be- iongs to the one, and what to the other, or what they

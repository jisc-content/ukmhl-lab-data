696 GLANDULAR SYSTEM, they perforate the organ, and ramify between it and the membrane it is cloathed with ; for in- stance, on injecting the hepatic artery the convex surface of the liver is instantly covered with small black strise, which proceed from this cause. The best method to obtain a complete investigation of the glandular arterial system, is to inject the kidneys with a solid substance, then to destroy the parenchyma by maceration, or by any other means. The arterial tree is then left bare and perfectly isolated. Museums are filled with pre- parations of this kind. The large arterial trunks twine in the glands, and communicate to these organs an internal motion that materially assists their functions. This motion is the more striking, as nearly all these organs laying very near the heart by their situa- tion in the trunk, are as it were under the im- mediate influence of its contractions. The salivary glands, the mucous glands of the mouth, and the lacrymal, on the one part; the testis, the prostate, and the mucous glands of the genital organs on the other, mark the two extremes of this position. A further cause which accommodates the motion in the glands by the approach of the blood, is that the arteries which resort to them, have but a very short distance to overrun. The spermatic artery is the only exception to this rule. Thus every thing in the secretion of semen appears to be characterized by a remarkable slowness. To

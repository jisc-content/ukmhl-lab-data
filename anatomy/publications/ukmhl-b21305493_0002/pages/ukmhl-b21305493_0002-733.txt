At the period of puberty, the adipose cellular tissue also often contributes to the volume of the mammae. This explains why a very small quantity of milk is often obtained from a large breast, whilst there is an abundant supply from a smaller. In the amorous sensations we feel at the sight of that form, we are fully aware of the dif- ference, without accounting for it; the breast, whose voluptuous swell is natural, from a projection, in which the skin of the organ merely is puffed up with fat. The cellular tissue is seldom found so very predominant in the sali- vary glands, in the pancreas, &c. and is rarely formed in considerable quantity in these organs. I have seen cases, however, wherein the parotid gland resembled a greasy muscle ; but it was not increased in size. In the testis, wherein the parenchyma, as in the preceding, is disseminated in partial isolated di- visions, there is no cellular tissue to serve as a means of union. All the granulated particles are separated by a kind of thread, like excretory ducts, and in knots by cellular lamellae. Glands characterized by a tight parenchyma, as the liver, kidneys, prostate gland, the mu- cous, &c. &c. are sparingly supplied with cellu- lar tissue : on being torn in different directions, they part without the least sign of intermediate Y Y 2

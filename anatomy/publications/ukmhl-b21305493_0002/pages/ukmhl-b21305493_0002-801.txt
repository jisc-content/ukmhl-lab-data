DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 759 to observe how much their mode of sensibility differs, how very different their diseases are : we might at first conclude, that in this twofold re- spect there was not the slightest analogy between them. The line of demarcation, however, is not near so real as might be supposed. In fact, the lively sensibility of the skin has not precisely its seat in that whitish tissue interwoven in such a manner as to leave between its meshes the spaces we have mentioned, and which are parti- cularly met with in the adherent surface of that organ. The experiment described, wdien speaking of the mucous system, wherein I have irritated the cutaneous organ froip within to without, evi- dently proves it. The surface containing the pa- pillae is particularly endowed with this vital pro- perty. It is proved besides, by pathological anatomy, that the internal surface of the dermis, where the tissue and the areolae we have spoken of are es- pecially found, is completely unconnected with almost every species of cutaneous eruption. This is quite certain in respect to the small-pox, the \tch, and a variety of tetters. I have also seen it in the vaccine pustules, in the miliary eruptions, &c. &c. It is fully ascertained, that in erysipelas, the external surface only of the corium is coloured by the blood the exhalents are gorged with. Thus the slightest pressure causing the blood to reflow, instantly produces a white spot,

OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 30 of condyles, &c., may, by their conformation, be assimilated to the short ones. The assemblage of fibres has been considered, by anatomists, as forming lamellae in juxta- position as it were ; united by processes according to some ; by the intersection of the fibres by others. These bony lamellae do not appear to me to exist in nature ; all the fibres of the outward shell ad- here together, cross each other, and constitute a whole that can not be conceived in this manner, which, besides, does not correspond with the irre- gular distribution of the vessels. Here, art has divided the fibres into layers, in the same manner as in a tendon, a ligament, &c.; but all this is nothing but fiction. To represent the bones as the result of their union, would be conveying a very incorrect idea of the structure of these organs; and it would be still more erroneous to consider these lamellae as adhering together by attraction, by means of bony points, by a kind of glutinous matter, as a substitute for glue. All such ideas, contradicted by anatomical inspection, suggested by a wrong application of the laws of adhesion of inorganic forms, to the adhesion of organized fibres in the present day, belong only to the his- tory of physiological errors. There is a circum- stance it is said, that evidently proves the lamel- lated structure of the bone ; it is exfoliation. It is true, that frequently very distinct lamellae are

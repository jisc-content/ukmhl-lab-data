DEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. 793 macerated tendons, muscles, &c. three or four months are required before it begins to be diffused into a fetid pulp. I have some that were macerated upwards of eight months since, yet still retain their primitive form, but diffuse under the finger being slightly pressed. In a semi-putrelaginous state, the skin still retains the faculty of twisting when submitted to the action of caloric ; it twines on burning upon coals, or when immersed in boiling water. It loses this property whenever it is reduced into a putrelage. Submitted to ebul- lition, the tissue of the dermis, when completely clear of cellular tissue, produces less froth than is obtained from the muscular, glandular, and mucous tissues ; in this respect it has some resem- blance to the tendons, owing undoubtedly to its being almost entirely of a gelatinous nature, and thus containing but a scanty portion of albumine, slightly contracting before ebullition commences, it twists on its own axis, by which the side of the epidermis becomes uniformly convex, and the opposite surface concave; what follows will ac- count for it. The fibres of the corium being drawn nearer together by the act of contraction, are compressed ; the areola? they contain disap- pear ; but these areolae being very spacious in the part opposed to the corium, it naturally follows that the tissue of the dermis becomes very nar- row in this direction, whilst the other surface hardly containing any areolae at all, forming, as

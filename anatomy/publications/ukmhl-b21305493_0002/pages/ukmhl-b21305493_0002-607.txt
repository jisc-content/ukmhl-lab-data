This sensation is of the very same nature as that re- ferred to the glands whenever there is stone in the bladder ; as that felt at the end of the nose from worms in the intestines, &c. There is no material cause for pain, and yet pain is felt. Thus, in in- termittent fevers a subcutaneous shivering is expe- rienced, although the skin is possessed of its natu- ral degree of heat. In this respect, I have ob- served that the mucous membranes are hardly ever the seat of a similar sensation of sympathetic cold, but that most generally the aberrations of the vital powers are produced by a sensation of heat. Whence does this difference between them and the cutaneous organ proceed? I cannot tell. To the sympathies of animal sensibility I also attri- bute that excessive thirst, proceeding from a seri- ous injury in any part of the body. In every considerable wound subsequent to an important operation, in experiments on living animals, &c.} this thirst, depending upon a sympathetic affec- tion of the whole raucous surface, extending to the mouth, stomach and oesophagus, is; observed. Animal contractility cannot possibly be brought to act sympathetically in the mucous system, since it does not exist in the organs of which it is composed. Sensible organic contractility, the kind of mo- tion we have pointed to, and bordering upon this

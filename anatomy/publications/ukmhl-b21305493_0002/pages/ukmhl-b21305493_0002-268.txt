N 226 FIBROUS SYSTEM. ARTICLE VI. Fibrous Capsules. i The fibrous capsules are infinitely more rare in the economy than has hitherto been thought. The scapulo humeral and the ilio-femoral articu- lations are almost exclusively provided with them ; in other parts, scarcely any thing more than the synovial membranes is to be met with. \ SECTION I. Forms of the Fibrous Capsules. These capsules form a kind of cylindrical tube, open at its two extremities, fastened by the cir- cumference of its apertures round the articulating surfaces, both superior and inferior, and inter- woven in these insertions with the periosteum ; they are so much the looser, as the articulation is calculated for more extensive motions; that of the humerus, for instance, admits of a much more extensive separation of the parts than that of the femur ; their lengths, in fact, are nearly the same. Now, as "on the one hand, the neck of the first bone is not so long as that of the second, and on the other hand, they are both inserted under this neck, it results from this, that the extension in both articulations is in a reverse ratio with the length of the articulating necks. These capsules, astonishingly strengthened by

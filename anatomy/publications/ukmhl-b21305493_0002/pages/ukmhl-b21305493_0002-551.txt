MUCOUS SYSTEM. 509 for some length of time, the mucous tissue, like almost every other in the economy, does not lose the power of shrinking the moment it is im- mersed in boiling water. This phenomenon is produced, either when in a dry state, or after it has been softened by cold water. By this means the valvulae conniventes are immediately repro- duced, an experiment that is very interesting. When ebullition has been continued for some time, the mucous tissue, white at first, gradually acquires a very deep grey colour. It is not softer than in the natural state, but is much sooner la- cerated, as is proved by the following experi- ment :â€”When the mucous corion, united to the subjacent cellular tissue, has been gently boiled, the latter resists much longer, and thus remains entire, whilst the mucous tissue has already been parted in several places. This corion never puts on that gelatinous appearance peculiar to the cu- taneous, to the fibrous, cartilaginous, and other ogans which yield abundance of gelatine. By mixing, however, a solution of tan with the water in which this system, selected from an adult subject, has been boiled, I have observed, an evi- dent precipitation. By the action of acids, the mucous tissue is re- duced to a pulp much sooner than the others. During life, caustics act more rapidly upon this membrane than upon the skin, whose epidermis being thick, prevents it from combining with

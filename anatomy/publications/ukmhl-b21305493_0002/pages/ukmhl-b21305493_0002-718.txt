GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 676 their fluids through different ducts, eafch of them being an assemblage of smaller tubes, opening near together, but all perfectly distinct, and with- out the slightest communication. Sometimes a a prominence exists at the point where all these ducts meet, as in the mammae, or over the breasts, in the prostrate gland, the verumontanum of which forms a kind of nipple. At other times it is a depression, a bag-like hollow that marks the place where these orifices open, as in the tonsils, upon the tongue, &c. Sometimes the surface over which the different ducts of a gland open, is even and smooth, as for those of the lacrymal gland, of the sublingual, and of almost all the mucous glands, &c. 2dly, Other glands emit their fluids through a single tube, as the parotids, the pan- creas, the sublingual, <fec. This disposition is nothing more than a modification of the pre- ceding. Where the tube opens, no projection in general is observed, the surface is smooth. 3dly. There are glands, which previous to emit- ting their fluids through their excretory organs deposit it in a reservoir where it remains for some time, and from whence it is subsequently expelled: such are the kidneys, the liver, the testicles, &c. Here, there are always two excre- tory tubes, the one proceeding from the gland to the reservoir, the other from the reservoir out- ward. These reservoirs are evidently a part ot their excretory duct.

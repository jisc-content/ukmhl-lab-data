E PI DERM01 DAL SYSTEM. 893 for a considerable time, the different laminae of which the epidermis of the palm of the hand and sole of the foot is composed, are easily sepa- rated from each other: this is even the best method to investigate accurately their structure : small vesicles filled with serum, often form between these laminae in the foot. ; The effects of heat upon the epidermis, are quite different from those experienced by the other systems from the contact of this body. A shred of this membrane perfectly dried by air, and exposed to the light of a candle, 1st, will hardly shrink, as would a piece of the cutis for instance, under similar circumstances ; 2ndly, it exhales a foetid smell, similar to that of burning horn, and different from that of every other tissue, also undergoing conflagration ; 3dly, it will also burn with the utmost rapidity, which is not the case with the preceding systems thus pre- pared ; frequently, if is only requisite to light one end that the whole may be consumed ; 4thly, in the flame a blackish fluid boils out, and escapes in drops, similar in every respect to those of a burning quill. This is evidently oil, which keeps up the flame, by its being so excessively abundant, and except in the hair and nails, it is not so abundant in any other part. This oil deserves a particular attention ; it is this oil that gives that very offensive smell, and forms those whitish and inflamed drops just mentioned. It

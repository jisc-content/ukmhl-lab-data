FIBROUS SYSTEM. 180 Although the numerous organs that are in- cluded in this classification belong to very dif- ferent processes; although they seem dissemi- nated here and there in the economy, without \ being in any way connected together ; although each appears isolated, yet they are nearly all con- tinued and held together, so that the fibrous system might be considered like the vascular and the nervous cerebral systems ; that is to say, as having a common centre from which the different organs that form its divisions radiate. This common centre of the fibrous system ap- pears to me to be the periosteum. I do not mean that similar to the heart or to the brain, it exerts any influence upon the organs that proceed from it, but that anatomical inspection discloses to us all the fibrous organs as closely connected with it, and communicating together by its means. The following observations will afford the proofs of it. 1st. Amongst the fibrous membranes, that of the corpus cavernosum interweaves with the pe- riosteum above the ischium ; the dura-mater is continued with it through the foramina at the basis of the skull. In uniting by the lamella that attends the optic nerve with the sclerotic tunic, it joins to it this membrane, between both of which it remains interposed; 2dly. Every fibrous capsule interweaves with the periosteum above and below the articulation ; 3dly. Wherever are fibrous sheaths, their fibres intermix with its

OF ORGANIC LIFE. 479 promoted by the abdominal muscles, which, with the whole system they belong to, are then brought into action. The general interior motion which occurs in the first moments of our existence, and which is caused by the suddenly increased activity of the involuntary muscles, fulfils an important use in respect to the mucous surfaces: it rids it of the fluids it was overloaded with, the presence of which was painful. In such parts as those where- in the mucous surfaces are not surrounded with involuntary fleshy layers, as in the bronchia, the fossae nasales, &c. muscles of animal life, more or less distant, fulfil this office ; such for instance as the diaphragm, and th^ intercostals, which clear the bronchia and pituitary surfaces by coughing and sneezing. As we recede from birth, the organic muscles generally increase in a less proportion than the others: hence all the systems are gradually ba- lanced together. The predominance of the former, however, is much less striking in the. foetus than that of the nervous system. The brain, for instance, is considerably larger than the heart. i It is probable that the muscles now under con- sideration, present at that period the same varie- ties in composition as the others, that gelatine particularly predominates, that fibrine is in a small quantity, &c. At an early period, the lat- ter substance is perhaps more plentiful in the

SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 6 44 by the synovial membrane. When ever the arti- culation is inflated, this membrane is seen swelling through these interstices, and presenting a texture quite different from that of the capsule. Berlin made this observation; but bethought the projec- tions were isolated, for he did not observe they were merely a continuity of the membrane extended throughout the whole articulation; 5thly. When viewing the serous system, we have noticed, that the smooth and polished aspect observed on the sur- faces of the organs, as well as in the cavities, was invariably derived from these membranes and not a part of their structure : now we shall find, that the synovial membrane is in respect to texture almost similar to the serous. It appears then, that in those parts, where the articulations have this character, it is derived from this membrane, although it may not be quite so distinct over these organs, as where the membrane is left float- ing. This smooth and polished aspect besides, is never observed in articulations evidently unpro- vided with this membrane. Such are the sym- physis pubis, and that of the sacro-iliac symphysis, which although contiguous, are found uneven and rough, &c. We have also ascertained that this structure can never be owing to compres- sion. From these various considerations we may, I believe, be easily convinced, that although the synovial membrane adheres at several points, it Id be viewed in a maimer perfectly similar to

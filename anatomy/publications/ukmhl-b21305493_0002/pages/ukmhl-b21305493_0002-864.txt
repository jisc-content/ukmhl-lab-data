DERMOIDAL SYSTEM, 822 bably an order of exhalents intended to separate this cutaneous fluid, an order distinct from that through which the fluid of perspiration flows. The cellular tissue, in fact, actually contains tubes that exhale fat and others that exhale serum. The fat is certainly not separated by glands, nor the mar- row, which is supplied by the exhalents of the medullary organ. It is, I think, quite as probable that this fluid is exhaled, as that it is secreted. Besides, this oil should not be confounded either with the ceruminous matter of certain glands on the edges of the eyelids, behind the ears, and which is expelled by pressure under the form of small worms, nor with that whitish matter which collects between the glands and the prepuce, evidently the produce of small glands. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Dermoidal System. SECTION i. Properties of the Tissue. These properties are very conspicuous in the skin; they are particularly displayed by those alternate transitions from a state of emaciation to that ot corpulence, which the body, particularly the limbs, are sometimes liable to, and by which they acquire a double and treble volume, and are again

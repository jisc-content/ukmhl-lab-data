10S OSSl'OUS SYSTEM. Organic sympathies are not less frequently produced by the affections of the teeth. Spasmo- dic vomiting, diarrhoea, acceleration of the pulse, frequently, even involuntary evacuation of urine, phenomena over which the sensible organic con- tractility of the stomach, the intestines, the heart, and of the bladder preside, are the frequent effects of dentition, particularly the first, as well as of violent tooth-aches, &c. Insensible organic con- tractility, and organic sensibility, are sympatheti- cally excited in obstructions in the parotid gland, in the general swelling of the face, in the increased secretion of saliva, and sometimes, in erysipelas, caused by an acute affection of these small and painful organs. Sympathies between the corresponding teeth in the same row, or between those of the two rows are frequently to be observed. My first superior left grinder is rather affected with caries, and sometimes causes much pain, and the opposite one on the right side becomes painful, although perfectly sound. There are other instances, in which a tooth of the lower jaw being affected, sympathetic pains are felt in the one above, and vice versa. The structure of the teeth being explained, let us now consider in what manner their different substances are formed. This point of bony nutri- tion appears to me, to have been but imperfectly investigated by the various authors. I shall *en-

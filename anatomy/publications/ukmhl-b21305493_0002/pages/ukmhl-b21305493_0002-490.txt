MUSCULAR SYSTEM 448 being isolated is null in respect to sensible organic contractdity; from their concurrence only, the exercise of this property will result. Now we are ignorant of what takes place in this concur- rence. To pretend to ascertain it, would be pre- tending to say how one body attracts another, how an acid combines with an alkali, &c. In at- traction, affinity, and irritability, we can follow the phenomena no further than to the action of bodies upon each other. This action is the boun- dary of our researches. But what should not escape our notice here is, that in this last property the action is never im- mediate. There is always between the excitant and the organ an intermediate that receives the irritation ; this intermediate is a thin membrane, and continued with that of the arteries for the heart; it is a mucous surface for the gastric vis- cera, and for the bladder. This intermediate ad- mits better of receiving the excitement than the muscles itself. I have constantly observed, that by irritating the internal surface of the heart, the contractions of this organ were more acute, than by laying its exterior tissue bare by the removal of its serous envelopement, and by exciting it subsequently. It is the same in respect to the organic muscles of the abdomen. Are there between the excited intermedium and the organ some nervous communications that transmit the impression ? I believe not: the cel-

Who knows if certain alterations in the pulse do not proceed from irregular dilatations, and others from irregu- lar contraction ? Iam far from maintaining this : for in physic, our belief should not rest upon pre- sumption, but upon facts ; but it might be an in- teresting object of research. It appears that sometimes the voluntary mus- cles are really the seat of active dilatation ; 1st. Laid bare or removed from the body, a muscle contracts and subsequently dilates, without the operation of any cause with regardâ€™ to the latter state ; 2dly. In amputation, the ends of the di- vided fibres are often seen to shorten and elon- gate alternately in the stump, a two-fold motion which seems also to be vital; 3dly. In different species of convulsions in which the limbs become stiff; in those for instance which accompany hys- teria, there seems to be a very active and rather considerable dilatation: in fact, on placing the hand upon muscles which, from the disposition of the part, ought then to be relaxed, they feel quite as hard as when they are contracted, &c. There is ample scope for further research on this mode of dilatation of our parts, a mode which certainly is not exclusively limited to the muscu- lar system, but seems also to belong to the iris, to the spongy tissue of the corpus cavernosum, to

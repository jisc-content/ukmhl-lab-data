DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 708 not sufficiently severe to produce contraction, there is also a sudden increase of exhalation be- neath the epidermis. The formation of the ve- sicle is constantly preceded by an inflammation of the external surface of the skin. This pheno- menon is not peculiar to this system. We have seen the serous, instantly on being denuded and irritated in some degree, redden in a short space of time by the passage of the blood into its ex- halents, constituting an inflammation, to which frequently succeeds an abundant exhalation of milky serum. This exhaled fluid does not stag- nate upon its surface, and forms no phlyctsense, because it has no epidermis. This is the only dif- ference in a phenomenon which at first sight does not appear to be the same in the serous and cutaneous systems. It is not only the irritation of the cutaneous organ that attracts the blood to the exterior ca- pillary system. Whenever the heart is strongly agitated, so that this viscus accelerates the course of this fluid, it is determined to these organs. This is evident; 1st. After violent running ; 2dly. During the hot stage of a fever, &c. In this respect I will make a remark that to me appears very important; it is that the capillary system of the face is much more liable than that of all other parts of the skin, to be permeated with blood ; 1st. This is obvious in the two cases I have just mentioned, wherein the action of the heait

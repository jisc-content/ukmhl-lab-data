SEROUS SYSTEM. 592 bone, &c. Every serous membrane, on the con- trary, is nearly foreign to the organ it invests ; their respective organizations are not connected, as the following lines will prove: 1st. These membranes are frequently seen alter- nately to forsake or invest their respective organs. Thus the wide ligaments, considerably distanced from the womb in the natural state fulfil the office of a serous membrane during pregnancy. The intestine on distending, borrows from the mesentery an envelopement it separates from on contracting. The omentum, as Chaussier has judi- ciously observed, is alternately a floating mem- brane in the abdomen, or a covering for the sto- mach; frequently the peritoneal covering of the bladder nearly forsakes it. Did not the her- nial bag of these enormous protrusions of the gastric viscera originally line the parietes of the abdomen, &c. ? Now, it must be evident, that since the various organs can exist, separate from their serous membranes, there is no con- nexion between their reciprocal organizations 2dly. They are constantly united by a loose tissue easily stretched in every direction, and never by vessels as in the major part of other adhesions. 3dly. The affection of an organ is not an indis- pensable consequence of that of its serous mem- brane ; and reciprocally the organ is frequently diseased, and the membrane continued healthy; for instance in the operation for hydrocele, the

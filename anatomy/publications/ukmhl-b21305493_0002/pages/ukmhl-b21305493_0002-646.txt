SEROUS SYSTEM. 604 may be added that of pus flowing from the cellular tissue and the serous surfaces; this fluid is not the same in both systems. We are unac- quainted with its difference of nature, but its exterior appearance is by no means the same. ' SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Serous System. Exh tl< nts. There is a constant exhalation from the serous surfaces. Vessels of a particular order are the agents of this exhalation, the materials of which is the fluid already mentioned ; these vessels are remarkably obvious in this system : it ' is the onlv one in which the anatomist can trace them distinctly; the following method will enable us to take a perfect view of them; 1st. Let a portion of intestine be drawn from the abdomen of a living animal, it will be found of a pinky hue, owing to the vessels beneath the serous layer, and hardly any vessels at all in that very layer will be seen. Let the intestine be irri- tated, and returned after having fixed it with a thread, as in the operation for hernia, accom- panied with gangrene, and at the end of thirty- six or forty-eight hours let it be withdrawn again; you will observe a multiplicity of red strise over-running that serous surface, and

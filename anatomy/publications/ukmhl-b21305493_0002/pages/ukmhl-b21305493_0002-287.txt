FIBROUS SYSTEM. 2J5 so excessive: thus by scraping with the scalpel the tendon at that age, the muscle may be sepa- rated from it without any marks being left, the polish where the fibres were implanted, and in other parts, being nearly the same. The end of the tendon fixed to the bone, is generally interwoven with the periosteum by expanding into it; so that it is with this membrane, and not with the bone itself, it is conjoined, because in fact, with that only it is identified by its nature ; thus if it meet with an analogous membrane, it equally unites with it, as is seen in the insertion of the straight and oblique muscles with the tunica scle- rotica, of the ischio and bulbo-cavernouses with the membrane of the corpus cavernosum, &c. In general tendons never unite but with fibrous membranes ; the serous, the mucous, every organ, in a word, that does not belong to the fibrous sys- tem, is foreign to them. SECTION II. Organization of the Tendons. The fibrous tissue is exceedingly tight in ten- dons ; several of them appear homogeneous at first glance ; but on being attentively examined* fibres united by a tight cellular tissue, and in ge- neral not a very abundant one, are soon ob- served. These fibres are very obvious in ebulli-

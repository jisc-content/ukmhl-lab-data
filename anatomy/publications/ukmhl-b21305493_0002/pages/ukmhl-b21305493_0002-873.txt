The sensibility of the skin, as we have seen, essentially resides in the papillae ; in these all the important phenomena relative to sensation are effected. It is the part of the skin which in reality belongs to animal life, as the rete mucosum, on account of the vascular plexus it is formed of, is the portion essentially connected with organic life. The corium left, as it were, in a passive state, remains a perfect stranger to every function of any importance, and merely serves as an envelopment. The very lively sensibility of the papillae re- quires an envelopment to shield them from too strong depressions. This envelopment is the epidermis.

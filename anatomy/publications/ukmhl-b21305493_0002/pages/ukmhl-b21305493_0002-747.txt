705 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Glandular System. SECTION I. Properties of the Tissue. These properties are in general rather obscure in this system ; and this appears to me to proceed from its not being of a fibrous texture. In fact, to extend and then contract, whilst a part conti- nues entire, it is necessary for the molecules of an organ to possess a certain degree of cohesion ; but it is to the fibre that this property especially belongs. It may be also remarked, that the glan- dular system is subjected to much less frequent causes of distention and contraction than the sys- tems with distinct fibres. This seldom happens but when serous and steatomatous collections take place internally, which are common in the substance of the liver, of the kidneys, &c. it is only then that it is distended ; but in this case it does not yield like the skin; the molecules se- parate ; it is the cellular tissue in which they are imbedded which is uniformly dilated ; the glan- dular tissue is soon destroyed. This is very evi- dent, when the collections of matter are formed near the convexity of the glands; however small the tumour may be, the organic tissue has VOL.. II, ^

774 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. projections set in a regular order, and is without any papillae properly so called. The multiplicity of very striking projections which make the skin of several subjects remark- ably rough, should not be mistaken for papillae. These projections consist of small cellular, vascu- lar or nervous lumps, or sebaceous glands, &c. situate close to the small apertures through which the corium opens under the epidermis, and which commonly transmit the hair. These lumps are contained within the small oblique tubes which terminate in the apertures by elevating the exter- nal covering, and thus project outwardly. The following is a very curious experiment, which evi- dently proves this arrangement. After the skin has macerated for two or three months, and even less, on the one hand, these small lumps, which generally contain a little fat, are converted into that whitish, thick, and mucous matter, similar to spermaceti, into which fat, after a long conti- nued abode in water, is constantly converted ; on the other hand the apertures widening, as we have seen, and the skin diffusing into a kind of pulp, it may easily be removed from these small projections, and they are seen continued with the fat that fills the meshes of the subjacent corium, and which is also converted into a solid sub- stance. That these cellular lumps contain vessels I have proved by injections, and of late I have also fur-

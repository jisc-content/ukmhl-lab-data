258 FIBROCARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. membrane on the other, enclose the organ ; in those of the articulations which this membrane sur- rounds on both sides ; and in those of the vertebrae, to which the posterior and anterior ligaments only correspond. In regard to the membranous fibro- cartilages, they are covered with a very distinct fibrous tissue, which is thick, adheres strongly to the proper tissue of the membrane, is easily dis- covered in maceration, which whitens it very evi- dently, and thus renders it completely distinct from /the fibro-cartilaginous tissue found in the middle. By splitting a fibro-eartilage of the ear, of the nose, that of the epiglottis, &c. after they have remained in the water, this fact is made obvious; particularly if the experiment be tried whilst they remain still possessed of the hue I have mentioned. The fibro cartilaginous system appears to have nearly the same connections with the gastric juices, as the fibrous and cartilaginous systems have, the nature of which they partake of; in the raw state these juices can scarcely act upon them. They yield much sooner when softened by boiling, being converted into a digestible food. In general this food is less nutritious than that produced by many other systems.

Hair is most easily impregnated with water; hence the possibility of using it to great advantage in hygrometers. The epidermis admits of it also; and the hair damped by foggy weather presents, in this respect, a phenomenon analogous to that of the epidermis, softened, wrinkled, and whitened by the contact of a poultice. 3dly. It is owing to this covering that hair is not connected with life, nor possessed of sensibility, and is never the seat of any kind of acute or chronic affection; 4thly. Whatever may be the colour of the hair, this envelopment is invariably white : it is the internal marrow that is the cause of colour: thus it is there is but little difference between the epi- dermis of black and that of white subjects ; hence, whenever the internal substance of the hair has disappeared, the canal only being left, it is more or less white. 5thly. In this state, although the interior of the hair is dead, the exterior epi- dermis, which is independent of it, most com- monly retains the power of growing again when cut; thus, the cutaneous epidermis does not actu- ally interfere with all the diseases subjacent to the skin. Cthly. I presume that it is owing to this part that the hair may be kept so long uninjured. Whenever these organs are screened from the contact of air, centuries may revolve without their being decayed; they do not possess witliii

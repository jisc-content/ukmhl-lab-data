556 M CJCOUS SYSTEM* in such cases is not only felt, but even very pain- ful, I have observed, however, that in this case sensibility is never so much increased as in the cellular, serous, fibrous systems, &c. undergoing inflammation: a phlegmon, pleuritis, &c. compared with a catarrh, will convince us of this. One would be induced to think that the organs feeling the least in their natural state, have the most powerful sensations in a morbid one. Animal contractility is wanting in the mucous system." Properties of Organic Life.'* In this system organic sensibility, and insensi- ble contractility or tone, are excessively deve- loped : they are incessantly brought into play by four distinct causes; 1st. By the nutrition of this system ; 2dly. By its absorption, either natu- rally or accidentally produced ; 3dly. By the ex- halation, of which it is the seat; 4thly. By the con- tinual secretion from its glands. These two pro- perties are the primitive causes of all these func- tions, the increase or reduction of which actually indicate the state they are in. As a multiplicity of causes are incessantly acting upon the mucous surfaces, as a great variety of exciting agents stimulate them uninterruptedly, at their origin particularly, this state, as well as the functions, must incessantly vary. The mucous system then varies from the

223 FIBROUS SYSTEM. There is a kind of parenchyma of nutrition in reserve, if I may be allowed the expression, con- stantly ready to receive the calcareous phosphate, when that substance cannot be conveyed to the diseased bone : hence the natural and artificial ne- croses which cannot take place in the teeth, because they are not provided with this membrane. These minute organs are subject to caries, and divers alterations, but never to a real necrosis. It can- not be doubted, but that the internal blades of the periosteum will successively admit of ossification, and thus contribute in some degree to increase the thickness of the bone, when its growth in the longitudinal sense is completed. I have observed in this respect, that not only this, but also the the aalincKna-bstan-ee ; after the cartilaginous sys- tem, it has the most tendency to become in- crusted, undoubtedly because its mode of general vitality, and particularly of organic sensibility, has a great analogy with that of the bones. Where- ever the tendons, by sliding over the bones, un- dergo considerable friction, they become ossified. The dura-mater, the tunica albuginea are fre- quently ossified ; the tunica sclerotica, in birds, performs the office of a parenchyma, conveying a considerable quantity of ^garthy substance, and to this must be referred the remarkable hardness of-their bonca.Â» The periosteum has nothing to do with the peculiar affinity with

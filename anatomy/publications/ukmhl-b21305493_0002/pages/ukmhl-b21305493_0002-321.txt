279 OF ANIMAL LIFE. Inspection proves nothing' of the kind. Why then has this been made an object of research, and opinions without foundation been produced ? The same remark is applicable to the intimate nature of this fibre upon which so much has been written; it is still unknown to us; and all that has been said respecting its continuation with the vascular and nervous organs, respecting the ca- vity filled with marrow, it was affirmed by some to contain, &c. is nothing more than a mass of incoherent ideas, supported by no positive fact, and unworthy of claiming a momentâ€™s attention. Let us begin to study nature where she comes within the cognizance of our senses. Such ana- tomical researches as have had the intimate struc- ture of the organs in view, I compare with those physiological researches on the primitive causes of the functions. In both we are without a guide, without any correct notions, why then should we dwell upon them ? All we know respecting the nature of the mus- cular fibre is, that it differs from others, that it cannot be compared either with that of the nerves os vessels, nor with that of tendons, or of the cellular tissue. Now we shall find, that in this point of view, all these systems differ essen- tially from each other, that consequently there cannot exist the slightest analogy between them ln what regards their nature from which the pro-? perties are constantly derived.

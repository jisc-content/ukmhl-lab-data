128 MEDULLAJIY SYSTEM* SECTION II. Organization. Authors have admitted a thin membrane lining the interior of all the bony cellulse, and which they have considered as the exhalant organ of the medullary juice. Although I have made repeated researches, I could never discover any such membrane. The vascular extensions only I have just been mentioning can be seen, which? being prodigiously multiplied, seem, in fact, to form a kind of membrane, but upon being ex- amined with due attention, are found very dis- tinct from each other, not at all continuous, ex- cept in their anastomoses, and leaving between them innumerable small spaces, by which the bone is evidently left bare, and in immediate con- tact with the medullary substance. The exhalation of this juice seems then ex- clusively to proceed from this vascular network, and in this respect it is similar to that of the com- pact substance, that evidently contains no mem- brane at all, although its pores are filled with medullary juice, as is proved by the combination of the compact tissue, by exposing it to the sun, or to artificial heat.

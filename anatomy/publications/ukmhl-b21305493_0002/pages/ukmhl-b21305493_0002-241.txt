Thus it is nature accommodates the animal sensibility of every organs to the different exciting causes the organ may experience, par* ticularly to those that might become fatal if we were not warned against them; this vital power is the essential agent that keeps the animal on the watch for its preservation. To this mode of sensibility in the fibrous sys- tem, must particularly be attributed ; 1st. The vio- lent pains that attend luxation ; 2dly. Those still more violent inflicted on the patient, by the exten- sions exerted with a view of producing them, particularly when, as with ancient dislocations, extraordinary exertion is required ; 3dly.

FIBUO-CAUTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 257 When exposed a few days to maceration, this tissue, white as it was, becomes strikingly red. The hue is darker than that acquired by the car- tilages of ossification from immersion in water. Does this proceed from the same causes ? I do not know. When the intervertebral fibro-cartilages are submitted to maceration, their fibrous lamellae also assume that reddish tint I have never ob- served in the other articulating fibro-cartilages, particularly in those of the knee. The membranous fibro-cartilages are rendered hard and brittle by desiccation; they do not as- sume the yellow colour of dried tendons and apo- neuroses, but have quite a peculiar aspect. In undergoing the same experiment, the inter- vertebral substances acquire a very remarkable transparency, different also from that of the fibrous system, but without any yellow hue. These substances, in the first days of their maceration, when they have been completely removed from their vertebrae, swell and rise, forming a kind of hollow cone, the summit of which is represented by the centre which swells considerably, and the basis formed by the circumference that remains in its natural state. The greater part of the fibro-cartilages are in general unprovided with a perichondrium : this is evident in those of the tendinous grooves, in which the bone on one side, and the synovial VOL. II. s

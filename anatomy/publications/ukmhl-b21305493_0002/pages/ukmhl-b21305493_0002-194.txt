CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 152 to form. They are; 1st. Long, as in the ribs; 2dly. Flat, as in the larynx, the nasal partitions, &c. Externally they are all lined with a fibrous mem- brane, similar to the periosteum, and in which se- veral muscles are implanted. To investigate this membrane properly, the cartilage should undergo maceration for a day or two : it then becomes visibly white, and thereby its thickness, and the direction of its fibres, &c. are rendered very evi- dent. The cartilages of cavities do not display the numerous apertures that are remarked in the bones, because the blood-vessels do not penetrate them. Few eminences, and few depressions are observed in them ; besides, their forms cannot al- together be viewed in a general light, because each being intended for very different purposes, they have but little analogy with each other, ARTICLE II. Organization of the Cartilaginous System. An organic texture can hardly be admitted in the interior of a cartilage ; it really exists, how- ever, and is composed of a proper and a common tissue.

77 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. but that mechanism would not be sufficient to in-Â» sure solidity : thus the bones, instead of presenting plain surfaces, are indented with dove-tailed like projections that are inserted into each other, as is seen in the parietal bones with each other, and with the sphenoid, the occipital, the coronal, &c. This is what is termed suture. This order of articula- tions sometimes approaches the preceding, as in the parietal or the coronal sutures, which reciprocally pressing upon each other, are more supported by this mechanism than by their own indentations, and in other parts are better connected with the fol- lowing order, as in the parieto-occipital order, in which very deep indentations only secure the so- lidity of the union. This order is never met with but in the ridges of flat bones; the indentations of these ridges, by multiplying the points of con- tact, compensate for their deficiency of surface; the projections and notches that compose the indentation, are always found irregular both in form and size. They are exactly framed on each other, bearing not the least resemblance in two bones of the same species, and proceeding from two different subjects; so that the left parietal bone of one individual could never be united with the right taken from another. Much has heen said of the formation of sutures; they aie a separate effect of the laws of ossification, laws we can no more account for than for any

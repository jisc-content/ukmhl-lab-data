If in young subjects emaciation suddenly takes place, there are no wrinkles left on the skin re-assuming its primitive state. SECTION II. Internal Surface of the Dermoiclal System. This surface every where corresponds to the cellular tissue, which is loose over the trunk, thighs, arms, &c., condensed in the cranium, hands, &c. In most animals a fleshy layer, termed panniculus, and similar in form to that which in man is nearly in every part beneath the mucous system, separates the skin from all the other parts, and gives to it a variety of motions.

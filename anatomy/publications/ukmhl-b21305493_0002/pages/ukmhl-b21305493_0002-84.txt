OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 42 to observe by the red hue that distinguishes them, that much blood is admitted. This blood is con- veyed by three different orders of vessels: some belong to the medullary canal, some to the can- celli, and the others to the compact tissue, or out- ward shell. The two last orders, distributed in the bony tissue, seem chiefly intended to provide it with the calcareous substance, for in respect to the cartilages of ossification, it is the white vessels only that convey the gelatine; it is the same thing with the other cartilages, which leads me i to think that this species of vessel is also intended in the perfect bones, for the nutrition of their cartilaginous parenchyma, whilst the blood ves- sels more directly belong to their calcareous part. Each medullary cavity is provided with one vessel only, and one aperture for nutrition. The diameter of this Vessel is proportionate with the organ which it penetrates without leaving any ramusculae in the compact tissue, and where it instantly divides into two branches. These pro- ceed in reverse directions to the two ends of the bones ramifying to infinity in the medullary organ, and losing their last ramifications when the cancelli begin, wherein they anastomose with the vessels of that tissue ; this situate in the me- dullary cavity, under the denomination of re- ticulated, and the internal surface of the compact

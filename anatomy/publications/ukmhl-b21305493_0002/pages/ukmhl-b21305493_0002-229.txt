FIBliOUS SYSTEM. 187 without undergoing any alteration ; it preserves its volume, form, and density ; this last lessens by degrees; the tissue softens, but is never dilated or swelled, as has been said ; its fibres may then be divided from each other, and the cellular tissue that was interposed between, is evidently seen to de- cay. Finally, after a very considerable time, it is converted into a soft and whitish pulp, of an homogeneous appearance. All the fibrous organs do not diffuse in this manner with equal facility. The tendons yield first to maceration ; next the aponeuroses; amongst the latter, those formed by the expansion of a tendon are sooner softened than those intended to inclose the limbs, than the fascia-lata for instance : the fibrous mem- branes, the capsules, and sheaths of the same nature, are more resistant. Finally, these liga- ments resist longer the action of water that tends to soften them ; however, when they originally proceed from a tendon, as the interior ligaments of the patella, they yield much sooner to macera- tion. I have made experiments upon all these organs in a comparative point of view, and the result was what I have just stated. Every fibrous organ immersed in boiling wa- ter, or exposed to a great degree of heat, shrinks, and contracts, as the greatest part of animal tis- sues ; it is reduced to a smaller volume ; on which account it becomes more solid, and assumes a de- gree of elasticity it does not possess in the natural

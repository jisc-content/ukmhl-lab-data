OF ANIMAL LIF E, 439 These experiments, which might easily be mul- tiplied on animals possessed of warm blood, but which I have not tried on those species, obviously disclose what belongs to the mechanical, and also to the vital contraction. An exact line, however, cannot be drawn between them, since the acid may be of that degree of strength, that the two causes of motion are confounded together. There is a mode of excitement that authors have not sufficiently noticed ; it may be termed a negative one, and is the same I have just men- tioned. In respect to caloric, the privation of which is frequently a very active stimulant, I have frequently made this observation, in the nu- merous experiments I have performed : â€” if an excitant be applied to a muscle, it instantly con- tracts ; but after some time the motion ceases, al- though the contact is continued : remove the agent, and the motion will often return instantly. Nothing is more common in the heart, in the in- testines, &c. than contractions ceasing under the continued action of a stimulant, and returning immediately on its being withdrawn. I admit that this phenomenon is not so invariable as that of the contraction produced by the application of a stimulant, which succeeds to a state of non-ex- citement, but it is frequently produced. In this respect it may be said, that the organic is similar to animal sensibility ; that every new state will aflect it, let this state be either a positive or a ne-

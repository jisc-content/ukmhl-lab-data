DEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. 777 The Action of various Bodies upon the Tissue of the Dermis. In almost every other texture we have consk dered this action in the corpse only, because, during- life, all these tissues are removed from external forms, and they cannot be influenced by them. Here it may be viewed in a twofold re. spect, sincedhe skin is incessantly, we may say, in contact with nearly every form in nature. The Action of Light. Light evidently acts upon the dermis in the same manner as plants. Let us only compare the inhabitants of towns, constantly shaded from the burning sun, with the rustic incessantly exposed to its influence, and we shall find the difference. It appears that the effect I have mentioned is produced by light and not by caloric ; for indivi- duals living in a warm temperature, but who are screened from the solar light, will become fair as those who inhabit cold climates. Thus we know that some men who seldom leave their heated rooms, are fairer than others, who living in a colder atmosphere, are constantly exposed to the sun. Were we to remain for ever in a bath equal in temperature to the hottest season, the skin would not blacken. Schools and chambers

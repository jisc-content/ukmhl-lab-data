948 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. although the skin was not at all concerned, and the hair alone had been affected. From all this it naturally follows, that the hair, similar to the epidermis in its external covering, and so far inert, differs from it in its internal substance, which, as 1 have already stated, is very imperfectly known. A further proof of this assertion is, that the phenomena I have stated, and to which many more might be added, are never observed when the hair, having turned white, retains nothing more than its external epidermis, the internal substance having disap- peared. This is proved by daily observation. It might happen, however, in this instance, that that part only of this internal substance corre- sponding with the colour, might chance to disap- pear, and that containing the seat of exhalation continue to live as usual; and in this respect white hairs might undergo the changes of living matter : of this, however, I think but few in- stances could be produced. All this besides must be subordinate to further experiments, which will, undoubtedly, at some further period, cast more light upon this system. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Hair.

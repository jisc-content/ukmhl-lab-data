OF ANIMAL LIFE. 357 animal life, except those of their cohesion, den- sity, and hue. By these phenomena they are nearly assimilated to those that belong to organic life, in which changes in the tissue are seldom as- certained, as the heart, the stomach, &c. afford in- stances of. The muscular tissue of animal life rarely sup- purates ; hence we are but imperfectly acquainted with its mode of suppuration. Inflammation of these organs appears generally to terminate by re-solution. Induration, gangrene, and suppura- tion, a treble issue .'fo.r This affection in other or- gans, have seemingly^ in the greatest number of cases, nothing to do with it in this. ARTICLE IV. Phenomena of the Action of the Muscular System of Animal Life. So far we have treated of muscular motion only, with the exception of the phenomena it presents in the muscles when in a state of activity. These phenomena will now come under consideration. They relate particularly to contraction, which is, in fact, the active state of the muscle, relaxation constantly being merely passive. The phenomena of these will be easily conceived, after the others, which are quite the reverse, have been properly investigated.

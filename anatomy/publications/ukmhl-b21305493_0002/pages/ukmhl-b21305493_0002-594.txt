MUCOUS SYSTEM. 552 â€¢ 1 perceive the contact of foreign bodies, especially at the origin of these surfaces. Her\ce animal sensibility is remarkably developed in this system. In several parts even, it exceeds that of the cu- taneous organ, wherein no sensation is so lively as those originating in the pituitary membrane from scents, in the palate from flavours, in the surfaces of the vagina, the urethra, and the glans, from coition, &c. But without speaking of these violent sensations, if I may be allowed the ex- pression, all the natural phenomena of the mu- cous surfaces display this property conspicu- ously ; it would be superfluous to dwell upon them any longer. I have remarked, that this sensibility, as well as that of the cutaneous organ, are essentially sub- mitted to the immense influence of habit, which incessantly tending to blunt the exquisite sense of feeling of these membranes, they imperceptibly acquire that state when they afford both less plea- sure and pain ; a state that forms the intermedi- ate link of these two reverse sensations; 1st. I have said, that sensations of pain originating in the mucous membranes are by habit converted into a state of indifference. The introduction of a bougie in the urethra is acutely painful the first day, less on the second, annoying the third, insensible the fourth. The pessaries introduced into the vagina, the plugs placed in the rectum, the tents fixed in the nostrils, the tube secured in

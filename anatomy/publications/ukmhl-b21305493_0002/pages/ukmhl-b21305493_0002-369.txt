If it be our object to produce convulsions, let an instrument be passed into the canal, let the marrow be excited either with that instrument, or with different chemical agents conveyed through its means, every part of the muscular system of animal life situate below, will instantly quiver and be convulsed. The higher the injury sustained by the marrow, the greater the danger; its influence in the lum- bar region bears upon the inferior extremities and the muscles of the pelvis only ; in the back it is followed by paralysis both of these muscles and of those of the abdomen. Now as these con- tribute indirectly to respiration, this function begins to be obstructed ; if the injury be above the dorsal region, respiration will be still more diffi- cult, because the intercostal muscles have lost their powers; the diaphragm alone maintains the action, because the diaphragmatic nerve still re- ceives and transmits the cerebral influence. If the injury happen to be above the origin of this nerve, there is an end to the action of the dia- phragm, to the contraction of the intercostal, and to that of the abdominal muscles; respiration ceases, and circulation is therefore interrupted j the blood being no longer conveyed to the brain, the action of this organ is annihilated.

GLANDULAR SYSTEM. G74 profusion of that unctuous and rather hard whitish substance observed in every cellular part submit- ted to continued maceration. It is not the glan- dular tissue that becomes altered, but merely the fat contained within the cellular space, and here very abundant. Acids act nearly the same upon the glandular tissue as upon all the others. They diffuse it into a pulp, which values both in colour and in the time required to produce it, according to the agent employed. The sulphuric acid is invariably the most efficacious in producing this pulp, which is then black, whilst it is yellow when the nitric acid is selected. The glandular tissue resists the action of boiling acids much longer than when these are cold. I have always observed, that few systems present this difference in a more striking light. Gland* are in general more indigestible food than many other animal substances, especially when boiled ; for boiling water in respect to these organs, produces an effect quite the reverse of that observed in cartilages, tendons, and all other fibrous organs, which by this process are deprived of their density, become soft, gelatinous, even viscid, and are soon dissolved by the gastric juice. I believe that the glands would in general ba much better digested if eaten raw. Every one knows, the more the liver is cooked, the more indigestible it is> This has induced me i

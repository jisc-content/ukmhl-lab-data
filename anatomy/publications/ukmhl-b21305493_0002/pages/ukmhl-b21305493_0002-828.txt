The serous fluids are in the natural state incessantly exhaled and absorbed; in respect to these, the absorbents fulfil the very same func- tions as air does in regard to the perspiration by which it is absorbed. Now although the func- tions of these organs are interrupted as in drop- sies, the exhalents still continue to act; the only result is, an accumulation of serum which, al- though it stagnates over the orifice of the ex- halents, does not prevent them from pouring out serum as usual. However much urine the bladder may contain, if this fluid be even extended to the very mouth of the ureters, these tubes will still continue to pour out their fluids. Although the mucous juices stagnate over their respective sur- faces, new juices are still conveyed to these sur- faces in the same manner; although the skin re- mains damp by the non-evaporation of the per- spired fluid, the perspiration is not less continued. Evaporation is a physical process, perfectly un- connected with exhalation, which is a vital phe- nomenon. Perspiration is effected in a bath in the same manner as in the open air. The only dif- ference consists in the fluid mixing with the water instead of being evaporated. The humidity of the skin proceeds from two causes perfectly distinct from each other; 1st. From an increase of fluid flowing from the cu-

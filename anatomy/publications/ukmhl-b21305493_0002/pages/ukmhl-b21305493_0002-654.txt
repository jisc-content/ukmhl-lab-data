612 SEROUS SYSTEM. the dura-mater, which is of a fibrous nature, that phrenzy should be referred of the diaphanous membranes, &c. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Serous System. SECTION i. Properties of the Tissue. Extensibility. The serous membranes are not endowed with such a considerable degree of extensibility, as might at first be conceived from the enormous di- latations they are in some cases susceptible of. This is obviously proved by the mechanism of their dilatations. This mechanism depends upon three essential causes: Isfcly. The developement of the plicae it forms, and this is the most effectual of the three causes. This is the reason the perito- neum is of all the membranes of this class, the most exposed to dilatations in pregnancy,from ascites and obstructions of the viscera, more frequent there than in any other part; this is the reason why the peri- toneum displays such a considerable number of these folds, such as the mesentery, the mesocolon, the me* ' sorectum, the large and small omentum, the fatty appendages, the fold of the appendicula cceci, the wide ligaments of the uterus, those posterior to the bladder, &c. &c. This also explains why these folds are particularly observed round such organs

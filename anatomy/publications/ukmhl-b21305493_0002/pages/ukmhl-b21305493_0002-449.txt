407 OF ORGANIC LIFU. their primitive form, and are not diffused into that pulpous state to which raw fibres are brought by similar experiments. The last-mentioned acid will dye them yellow as previous to ebullition. In respect to the shrinking produced the mo- ment ebullition begins,â€”I have remarked that it is invariably the same, whatever may be the ante- rior dilatation or contraction of the fibres. The stomach left sufficiently dilated at death to con- tain several pints of liquid, will contract to the same volume, (ceteres paribus,) so as not to ex- ceed the size of the ccecum. Diseases have some influence upon this contraction. The heart of a consumptive subject, in the very same experiment, did not so evidently display this phenomenon, as that of one who had died from apoplexy. The resistance offered by the organic muscular fibres is proportionally more considerable than that of the fibres in the muscular system of ani- mal life. To whatever degree the extension of the hollow fibres is carried during life by the fluids they are filled with, they are rarely lacerated. The bladder alone may sometimes, but very rare- ly, present this phenomenon. In considerable re- tentions of urine, when laceration ensues, they most generally occur in the urethra, the bladder remaining uninjured. In practice, a hundred ul- cers in the perineum, proceeding from the mem- branous portion, will be observed, to one above the pubis. Authors relate numerous instances of

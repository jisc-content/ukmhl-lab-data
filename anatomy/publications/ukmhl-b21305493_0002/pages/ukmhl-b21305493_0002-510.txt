MUSCULAR SYSTEM 468 very evidently seen; 1st. Complete contractions similar to those of the voluntary muscles, con- tractions which take place during health, which cause the projection of blood, and which are easily produced in experiments when the animal is still alive ; 2dly. Multiplied oscillations of the fibres which agitate them all without producing any sensible effect, without contracting the ca- vity, without forcing out the blood for instance. These oscillations are observed at the moment of death, when the heart ceases to contract; it is then in vain we apply stimulants, perfect con- traction cannot be produced; although a general vibration is very evident, the cavity is not con- tracted, and the contained blood accumulates. In this respect the heart perfectly resembles the vo- luntary muscles; it is agitated in the same man- ner as these muscles, in ague, in what is termed shivering, and which is observed in the subcuta- neous muscles of some individuals: I have al- ready seen several persons affected with an habi tual and irregular action in a portion of the so- leus perfectly distinct to the eye through the skin, and which did not interfere with the con- traction necessary to the extension of the foot. This two-fold mode of contraction is never met with in the involuntary muscles of the abdomen. Instead of abrupt, sudden contractions, nothing but a slow shrinking, frequently hardly apparent, is observed; there is not even, properly speak

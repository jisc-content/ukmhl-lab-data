DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 77 6 of being elevated, and these small cutaneous tubercles are never observed ; very few are found in the face, in which an infinitude of vessels from within cross through the small pores we have mentioned. The papillas disseminated between these prominences are in general very obvious wherever they exist. Anatomists have ascribed to the latter a nervous structure; they consider these projections as the termination of the nerves that resort to the skin, and which, according to their idea, expand to form them after having previously been stripped of their outward sheath. Some even pretend to have followed the filaments as far as in the body of the papillae. I must confess I could never suc- ceed in this. In the natural state, the density of the corium in common with the excessive te- nuity of the filaments with which it is crossed are strong obstacles. After long continued ma- ceration, when the corium is reduced to a pulpy state, and consequently when these filaments might be traced, none can possibly be seen. I do not, however, pretend to deny the structure ascribed to these forms. The quick sensibility the skin is possessed of, seems even to admit of it; but this is analogy, and by no means a demonstra- tion. In fact, all other senses, the organs of which are endowed with such exquisite sensibi- lity, have all their portion which receive the impression from bodies continuous with nerves.

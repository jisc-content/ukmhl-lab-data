315 OF ANIMAL LIFE- performed on living animals, they cause no re- markably painful sensation : pain is severely felt, only when a nervous filament is divided by the incision- The proper tissue of the muscles is hardly possessed of any sensibility, nor is this property better displayed by the application of any chemical stimulant whatever. There is, however, in muscles a peculiar sen- sation, which most evidently belongs to this pro- perty ; it is that experienced subsequent to re- peated contractions, and termed weariness. After a long continued position, this sensation is par- ticularly felt in the thick fasciculi of the lum- bar-muscles. Subsequent to progression, running, &c. if performed on a horizontal plane, all the muscles of the inferior limbs are affected; if on an ascending plane, it is the flexors of the ilio- femoral articulation, and in the contrary case, the same sensation is felt in the posterior mus- cles of the trunk. In such trades as especially require the exertion of the upper extremities, this sensation is frequently experienced in a very remarkable manner, and which, most undoubt- edly, is not owing to the compression of the con- tracted muscles upon the small nerves, with which they are supplied. In fact, it may be experienced without this antecedent contraction, as is ob- served during the commencement of numerous diseases, wherein it generally extends over the whole muscular system, the patient complaining

MUSCULAR SYSTEM 392 fair sex, form a contrast with the kind of harsh- ness in those of man. The increase in the bulk of the muscles ap- pears to operate much more on the fleshy than upon the tendinous and aponeurotic parts. The intermuscular aponeuroses in particular do not appear to grow in proportion to the1 fibres that are affixed to them, so that these form a projection, and in the part of the aponeuroses there is a depression which is better observed in muscles crossed in their insertions by a quantity of fibrous substance, in the deltoid in particular. The projection of the whole muscle under the skin not only shows more clearly the depressions which se- parate them from each other, but also each fleshy layer forms a prominence separated by a groove, which, however, is distinct in rather lean subjects only. In proportion as the muscle increases in thick- ness, it acquires^more density, it becomes firmer, and more resistant; if the hand, for comparisonâ€™s sake, be placed on two similar muscles of an adult, and of an infant, whilst they are con- tracted, a remarkable difference in the hardness is observed. If weights be suspended to muscles proceeding from two subjects belonging to these stages of life, they will prove the different de- grees of their resistance. The muscular tissue of an adult will resist all kind of re-agents much longer.

OK ANIMAL LIFE. 341 part depend upon this organ not receiving a suf- ficient impulse from the heart, upon which organ the first influence of this passion bears, and les- sens its motions. It is a vulgar saying, that fear deprives one of his legs ; it petrifies, &c. These expressions borrowed from vulgar language, pro- claim the effects of this passion upon the muscles ; but this effect is secondary only : the first influ- ence bears upon the heart, the second upon the brain ; in a third order only are the muscles af- fected. This explains why certain animals are rivetted to the spot at the sight of their voracious enemy, ready to make them a prey. To the sympathetic influence of the internal or- gans over the brain, the motions of the foetus must also be attributed, motions that are not directed by the will; for the will is only the result of intel- lectual phenomena. Now these phenomena are yet unexisting at that stage of life. The internal functions, very active at that period, suppose a considerable action in the liver, the heart, the spleen, &c. On this account these organs effectu- ally influence the brain, and this in turn brings the muscles into motion, so that animal contracti- lity is by no means voluntary in the foetus, it can become so only when sensation has brought the intellectual phenomena into play ; until then they should be assimilated to those here above-men- tioned. From all that has been said, will, I trust, easily

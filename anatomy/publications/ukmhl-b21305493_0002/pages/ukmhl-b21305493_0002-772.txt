GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 730 in winter, in cold than in hot climates. In fact, heat, by which the cutaneous system is dilated increases its action at the expence of that of the glands; and reciprocally, cold, by which this membrane is condensed, checking its habitual exhalation, compels the glandular system to in- crease its action in turn, and compensate for the deficiency. Hence it is that the very same quantity of fluid admitted into the economy is during win- ter discharged by urine, in summer by perspira- tion ; that, to effect in summer instantaneous eva- cuation of urine, perspiration must be suppressed by the sudden application of cold on the surface of the skin, by entering a cellar or some subterra- neous vault, &c.; so that during summer the resi- due of fluids may be expected either through the urinary organs, or by means of perspiration, ac- cording to the temperature of the atmosphere in which digestion is effected; hence, why tisanes and diuretics should not be given at the same time, and why a physician who would indiscriminately re- commend their use, would prove how ignorant he was of the laws of our economy ; why the greater part of diseases attended with an immo- derate flux of secreted fluids, are most generally characterized by a diminution of the exhaled fluids; why, in particular seasons, diseases have more tendency to manifest themselves by perspi- ration, and in others to terminate in the evacua- tion of mucus, urine, &c.

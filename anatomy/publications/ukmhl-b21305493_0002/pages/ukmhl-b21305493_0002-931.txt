epidekmoidal system. 889 except in the hands and feet, never more than a single layer is to he seen : the tissue of the epider- mis contains no fluid at all. But in every direc- tion either in the living subject, or in the corpse, nothing transudes: the exfoliations are always dry, nay even brittle : it contains no blood vessels. The absorbents and exhalents merely cross this membrane, they form no anastomoses, neither do they twine in previous to reaching its surface, as is the case with the serous membranes, which are therefore rendered darker by injections, though apparently a small quantity of blood only is cir- culated in them during life. The colour of the epidermis, on the contrary, is never changed by injection, even when the fluid, being very liquid, has succeeded to the utmost, and showers over the external surface of the skin. Thus in inflam- mation, when the cutaneous exhalents are gorged with blood which they did not contain in the natural state, this fluid never penetrates the epi- dermis, which always remains free from the diseases that invade the subjacent layer, and which being merely loosened by inflammation, falls, and is again regenerated. The epidermis like the cellular tissue is evidently not supplied with nerves. The granulations also which are especially formed by this last tissue, are never seen to originate from this mem- brane ; nor do its excrescences assume such a varied character as the tumours which the cellu-

380 MUSCULAR SYSTEM two muscles that simultaneously contract are placed in the same direction, there is no waste of power : this is what happens when the genio-hy- oidei and the mylo-hyoidei lower the jaw, or raise the os-hyoides; they act conjointly: but when two muscles are partly opposed to each other, and partly in the same sense as the sterno-mas- toidei, a part of the power is wasted, the other part remains. The action by which the sterno- mastoidei tend to direct the head to the right and left, is null; that only by which the head is in- clined produces its effect, which is twofold, consi- dering the action of the two muscles, which are also at the same time assistants and antagonists. From this it is obvious, that these words not only apply to the motion produced by the contracti- lity of the tissue, but also very frequently to those produced by animal contractility. % SECTION VI. Phenomena of the Relaxation of Muscles. Whenever a muscle has ceased to contract, it presents properties quite the reverse of the pre- ceding, which should be understood in order to investigate the latter. The muscle lengthens and softens, ceases to be corrugated, and is perfectly restored to the state it was in : to present a series of these phenomena would not answer any useful purpose. I have remarked, that in the state of

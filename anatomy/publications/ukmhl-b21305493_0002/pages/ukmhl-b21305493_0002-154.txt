OSSKOUS SYSTEM. m cellular and medullary cavities, that gradually increase: 3dly, when the ossification of the tooth is completed, the portion of the membrane of the follicle that lined the socket remains the same, whilst the part corresponding to the pulp, previously free on the other side, becomes on this, adherent to the whole cavity of the socket, that is lined by it, forming the membrane already mentioned when speaking of the structure of the teeth, which membrane is interposed be- tween the pulp and the bony substance : 4thly, the pulp of the tooth is the first portion that is formed, it forms also the most considerable part of the tooth in the early times. Subsequent to this, it seems the bony part is produced, and that finally the enamel forms over it. I have not yet been able to exemplify this mode of origin. The period, for the formation of the membran- ous follicle is difficult to ascertain; that of the first ossification seems to be between the fourth and fifth month. At birth, the twenty teeth of the first dentition are already seen rather forwarded ; the rudiments of the root in the shape of a wide tube, with very thin parieties, gradually extend- ing in both directions, also begin to be perceived : on reaching the bottom of the socket, this last being too narrow to contain the tooth, the organ forces its way out.

I have long been induced to believe that the admission of these fluids in the vascular system, must be attended with the most fatal conse- quences. I was besides supported in this opinion, 1st. By my own experience wherein I have con- stantly observed, as I have said, that, urine, bile, &c. injected in the cellular tissue, were never absorbed, but produced abscess. 2dly. By acci- dental infiltrations of urine in the parts near the bladder, from which abscesses originate. 3dly. By the fatal consequences attendant upon the effusion of this fluid on the peritoneum, in the high operation of lithotomy, of bile over the same surface in certain penetrating wounds, a two-fold instance in which these fluids are never returned to the blood by absorption, as the peritoneal serum, but in every instance almost occasion death. 4thly.

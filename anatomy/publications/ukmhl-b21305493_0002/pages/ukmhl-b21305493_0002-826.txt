784 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. and to the parts which life has forsaken. Anti- septics are applied either to prevent the death of the part or to obviate putrefaction ; 1st. If for the first purpose the choice of antiseptics should be varied, loosen the ligature which had previ- ously been applied in the artery of an animal, and it will be an antiseptic operation. Bleeding, the use of diluent applications intended to dimi- nish the intensity of inflammation in phlegmon, are antiseptics. Tonics, such as wine for in- stance, all stimulants in short, calculated to rouse the vital powers reduced in a part in consequence of mechanical injury, are antiseptics, &c. It then follows that this term is misapplied in re- spect to medicaments intended to prevent the mor- tification of the parts. If antiseptics be used to prevent a dead part surrounded by healthy parts from becoming putrid, some effect may be ob- tained from such applications. Thus, by sprink- ling a portion of the skin, the end of the nose, &c. with the pulverized bark, muriate of soda, or any neutral salt, or by moistening these parts with the gastric juices, we may stop the progress of putrefaction as in a corpse, by using the same means. But what is the result ? Rather less foetor, and in the adjacent part, rather less propensity for their receiving the influence of the emanations from the dead part; but ulti- mately this must fall; antiseptics never can re- store it to life. Hence it is obvious, that such

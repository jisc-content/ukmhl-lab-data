166 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. the proofs by which it was demonstrated, when the system of the bones was considered. In speaking of that system, I have pointed out how the cellular and vascular parenchymae primi- tively formed, and constituting the mucous state, are subsequently permeated with this basis; this is what forms the cartilage. The original mode, then, of the formation of this system of organs, is already investigated ; let us now consider in what manner its developement is continued. * SECTION I. State of the Cartilaginous System in the Early Age. Tn proportion as the bone becomes ossified, and this organ is consequently more sparingly sup- plied with gelatine, this substance seems to flow with more abundance over the articulating sur- faces ; for the cartilages that cover these parts lose their primitive softness, assuming a degree of consistence that gradually increases. Much more gelatine, however, disappears from within the bones, than what is absorbed by the cartilages; so that it might be said, this substance gradually de- creases in the organs, as we advance in age. We are perfectly aware it is the parts of young ani- mals that are selected to make glue, jellies, &c. The articulating cartilages display at that period a phenomenon I have repeatedly ascertained in my experiments: when they have undergone

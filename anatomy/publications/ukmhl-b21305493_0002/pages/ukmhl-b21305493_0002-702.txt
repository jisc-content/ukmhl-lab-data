660 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. Fine and delicate, in the foetus and in the in- fant, the synovial membranes of the tendons ac- cord with the varied and incessant motion at the latter period. Tighter and denser in the adult, they grow rigid in old age, exhale less fluid, dry, and contribute no little by the state they are in to the slowness of the motions brought on by old age. Some of the synovial membranes are not always found: such, for instance, is that of the gluteus major, in lieu of which, nothing more than a cel- lular mass is frequently substituted. These kind of membranes, when existing, are in general very dry: their synovia is hardly discernible. In this respect they resemble similar membranes of the vertebra, of the clavicles, &c.

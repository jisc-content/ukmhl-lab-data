SEROUS SYSTEM. 623 enveloped. Thus in the stage subsequent to youth, the serous surfaces of the chest are frequently the seat of inflammations, dropsies, <&c.; whilst in the age bordering upon decrepitude, affections of the peritoneum are most common. In old age, the serous system grows dense and tight, and its adhesions with the surrounding parts are more obvious: hence it will not so rea- dily admit of those motions we have mentioned; its reduced powers oppose more difficulty to ab- sorption, and it is frequently the seat of dropsy. When affected by diseases, these, from a similar cause, assume a remarkably chronic type. In the Hotel Dieu, there are several aged persons who have long suffered from tubercular inflammation of the peritoneum, whilst younger subjects soon fall a victim to similar affections. Thus, in aged subjects, cancers often remain inert as it were, and unattended with pain, whilst in adults they gene- rally run their course with great rapidity. Serous effusions are much less frequent in old age, than the infiltrations of the subcutaneous cellular tissue, but yet they are more frequent than those of the intermuscular tissue. The serous system ossifies ; but not like the arterial, the cartilaginous system, &c. as the effect of age. These membranes are not always found ossified in old subjects ; and when this phenome- non takes place it is not confined to any period of life. It is a disease, a real tumour, whilst in the

430 MUSCULAR SYSTEM supplied by them. Now on cutting, tying, or ir- ritating these nerves in any manner whatever ; on exciting the ganglions from whence they project; on destroying them with a strong concentrated acid or alkali, the muscle remains in its natural state ; its contractions are neither accelerated nor diminished. I have not been satisfied with using the com- mon agents to ascertain invariably the actual de- ficiency of the nervous influence upon the cerebral muscles; a fact consequently admitted by every judicious physiologist, in spite of the hazardous opinions of a few physicians who have applied the vague expression of nervous influence to or- gans that are by no means calculated to admit of it. I have used galvanism, and have convinced myself that this means of bringing in organic life the muscular contractions into play is almost wholly ineffectual, whilst it is the most powerful of all in animal life. I shall not repeat now my experiments on this subject; the particulars may be read in my researches upon death. From all that has been stated there, it may be concluded that we are completely unacquainted with the influence of the brain and the nerves upon the muscles; that it does not operate as upon the voluntary muscles. It must, how- ever, exist to a certain degree, since the nerves

25 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. if general death did not precede this partial death of the osseous system. ARTICLE II. Organization of the System of the Bones. The tissue peculiar to the system of the bones, forms in that system, particularly as age advances, the principal and predominant part. The organs in common are proportionally much less nu- merous. SECTION i. Tissue proper to the Osseous System. The tissue of the bones, like almost every one in the other organs, has a fibrous aspect, the na- ture of which is every where the same, but being differently arranged, admits of two essential mo- difications. In the one, the fibres, more or less distant from each other, display a profusion of cellulee; in the other, closely compressed toge- ther, they form a kind of compact substance, in which they cannot be discerned without the ut- most difficulty. Hence two subdivisions in the tissue of the bones,â€”the cellular and the com-

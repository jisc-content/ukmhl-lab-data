FIBROUS SYSTEM. 178 that sometimes they form coverings for different parts, at other times they provide the muscles with points of insertion : hence the aponeuroses for envelopement, and those for origin or in- sertion ; each of these are divided into two species. The aponeuroses for envelopement are placed sometimes round a muscle, to which they form a general sheath, as is seen in the thigh, in the fore arm, &c.; at other times they are seen covering certain muscles which they in part retain in their respective situations, as that which proceeds from the serratus posticus superior, to the serratus posticus inferior, as the abdominal aponeurosis, or again, as that situate behind the soleus, behind the deep muscles of the leg, &c. The aponeuroses for insertions sometimes dis- play more or less extended surfaces, as in the origins of the triceps adductor fern oris, of the rectus femoris, of the gemelli, &c. ; at other times fibres separate from each other, and give insertion by each of these fibres to a fleshy one, as at the superior insertion of the iliac, of the anterior tibial, &c. Finally, they sometimes form arches, and then they at the same time give insertion to muscles, and suffer vessels to pass under them, as in the diaphragm, the soleus, &c. SECTION II.

336 MUSCULAR NYSTUM these various causes does not appear to proceed from the brain, most generally, at least, in such cases, this organ does not appear the least af- fected. I confess, however, that in these affec- tions it is not easy to determine what proceeds from the state of the muscles, and what from that of the nerves; these organs perhaps are especially affected, but most undoubtedly the brain has no- thing to do with it. Causes that produce Animal Contractility. We have just seen, that in the natural state this property constantly requires three actions ; 1st. That of the brain; 2dly. That of the nerves; 3dly. That of the muscles : that the principle of motion originates from the brain, is propagated by the nerves, and received by the muscles ; but it is requisite that the influence of the brain be called forth by some other power ; animal con- tractility, in fact, being essentially intermittent, a fresh cause is required to excite it to action when- ever this action has ceased ; now in the natural state, this cause acts first upon the brain. The causes that excite this organ for the pro- duction of animal contractility, I refer to two causes. The first includes will; the second, every impression the brain receives, and which does not come within the empire of the soul. The brain is a medium between the soul and

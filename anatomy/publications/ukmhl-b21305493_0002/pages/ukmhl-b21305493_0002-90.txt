48 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. SECTION II. Properties of the Tissue. Although hardness and solidity appear to be opposed to every kind of extension and contrac- tion in the system of the bones, yet these two phenomena are frequently very apparent; and the properties of the tissue from which they pro- ceed are very striking. The extensibility of the bony fibres is suffi- ciently proved by the observations made in nume- rous diseases; for instance, in the spina-ventosa, in the swelling in the maxilliary sinus, when affected with a polypus, in the expan^ons of the bones of the skull, from hydrocephalus, &c. Jn respect to these various distensions, I have remarked, that frequently, from the influence of similar causes, the bones that in the above mentioned cases yield and distend, are fractured, worn away, and destroyed in others. A polypus perforates the naso-palatine partition, without any previous distension ; aneurism of the aorta does not bend the sternum forward, nor does it force the verte- bras to yield ; it perforates and destroys these bones. The cause of this difference in effects, in- fluenced nearly by similar causes, is not easily determined. The contractility of the tissue,

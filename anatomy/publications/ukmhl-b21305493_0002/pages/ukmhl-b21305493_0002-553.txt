511 MUCOUS SYSTEM, of curding milk, in the same manner as many other substances have,â€”acids in particular. Should we attribute to this property a phenomenon in- variable during life, namely, the coagulation of milk, the moment it enters the stomach ? or does this phenomenon proceed from the mixture of this fluid with those which are separated on the surface of that organ ? I believe they both ope- rate simultaneously; individually, in fact, they both produce the phenomenon. Spallanzani has ascertained it, in respect to the gastric juices. We / know that when dried, and divested consequently of these juices, the mucous membrane retains the property of curding milk. Spallanzani has also convinced himself, that the serous and organic muscular systems of the stomach, do not possess this property. Are apthae an affection of the mucous corion ? Do they belong to the papillae ? Have they their seat in glands, whilst catarrhs are characterized by a general inflammation of the mucous system of some considerable extent ? These questions require a further consideration. Pinel was fully sensible that pathological anatomy was deficient in this respect. Mucous Papillae. The peculiar mode of sensibility the skin en- joys, is chiefly attributed, as is sufficiently known.

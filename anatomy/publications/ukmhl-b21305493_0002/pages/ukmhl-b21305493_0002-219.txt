FIBKOUS SYSTEM. 177 called 5 2dly. The fibrous capsules; 3dly. The tendinous sheaths ; 4thly. The aponeuroses. 1st. The fibrous membranes include the perios- teum, the dura-mater, the tunica sclerotica, the tunica albuginea, the proper membranes of the kidneys, of the spleen, &c. &c. They are generally intended to cover certain organs, to the texture of which they contribute.. 2dly. The fibrous capulses, very different, as we shall see, from the synovial surfaces, are a kind of cylindrical bags that are found round some articu- lations, especially round those of the femur and the humerus, which they connect with the sca- pula and the ilium, by inclosing both their arti- culating surfaces. 3dly. The fibrous sheaths are intended to fix the tendons on their crossing over the bones, where they undergo flexion, and generally in all parts in which, by the contraction of the muscles, they are liable to deviate, and thus transmit but imperfectly the motion they receive from these organs. They may be divided into two species ; some receive and transmit the united tendons of several muscles, as those observed in the wrist, the footstep, &c. ; others, like those of the fingers, are intended for an isolated tendon, or for two only. 4thly. The aponeuroses are a kind of fibrous canvas, more or less extensive, always connected with locomotion, and disposed in such a manner > vol. n. N

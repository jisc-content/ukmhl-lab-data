SEROUS SYSTEM. 588 we have sometimes found this atmosphere, the focus of very different phenomena, and transmit- ting diseases from one organ to another, hut then the serous membranes constantly oppose a more immoveable obstacle, because there is rio commu- nication by filaments with other organs, they are merely connected with the organs they invest. It rarely happens that a disease of the liver is extended to the intestines, of the spleen to the stomach, &c. The polish of the free surface of the serous system facilitates in a remarkable degree, the motions of the organs it invests. We have already observed that nature had secured two essential means of fulfilling this end, namely the membrane and the cellular tissue. As the exterior is provided with the latter of these means, the interior is especially provided with the former. These internal motions are generally considered too abstractedly, and merely as they relate to the functions of the organs by which they are performed, in respect to circulation for the heart, to respiration for the lungs, to digestion for the stomach, &c. But they should also be viewed in a general light; they ought to be considered as conveying to the machine a continual excitation which sustains, and stimulates the action and power of every organ, of the head, of the chest, and ot the abdomen ; which receive less forcibly than the organs ol the limbs, the influence of

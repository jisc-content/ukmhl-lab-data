MUCOUS SYSTEM. 525 the pituitary membrane, upon the glans, the mem- brane of the urethra, upon the pharynx, &c. on the uvula in particular, which is so exquisitely sensi- ble ? Why, instead of applying blistering plaisters on the perineum, or the sacrum, is not a bougie introduced in the urethra for paralysis of the blad- der? In cases of hemiplegia, instead of acting upon the cutaneous organ, I have already twice used the following means :â€”I have introduced a bougie in the urethra, and one in each nostril, whilst the surgeon irritated, from time to time, the uvula ; the patients appeared much more excited, than by blistering. Strong purgative injections,and emetics, prove what advantages may be derived in such cases from exciting the mucous mem- branes. In ophthalmia, would it not often be pre- ferable to produce an artificial catarrh in the nostril adjacent to the diseased organ, than to apply a blister or a seton over the neck ? I attempted it once, but without success, for the disease was of long standing and inveterate. I intend frequently to renew these trials in the Hotel Dieu, on various subjects. In general, I believe, that in diseases excitement of the mucous membrane might often be substituted to that of the skin, with much more advantage, since, upon the mucous system, contact is sufficient, and to form a kind of ulcer, by destroying the epider- mis, is by no means requisite. ' The mucous membranes act by their uninter-

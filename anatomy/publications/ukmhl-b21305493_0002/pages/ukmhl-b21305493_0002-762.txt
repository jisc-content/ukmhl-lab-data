GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 720 Although I have considered as sympathetic several disordered secretions in diseases, I am very far, however, from thinking they are all so. In a multiplicity of cases, there-is certainly a ge- neral affection of the whole system, an affection of which the glands, as well as all the other parts, partake ; it is what takes place in some fevers, &c. But whenever a system is especially affected, as the cutaneous, in smail-pox, meazles, scarlatina, &c.; the serous in pleuritis, in perito- nitis, &c.; the cellular in phlegmon ; the nervous in convulsions, &c.; or whenever the symptoms do not proceed from any injury which their tissue may have sustained, I call it sympathetic. Other ideas may be attached to the word sym- pathy ; but such is the meaning I attach to it; and if we agree in this respect, it is of little con- sequence what term we employ. Active Sympathies. These sympathies are not so frequent as the preceding, however they are observed in the diseases of the glandular system. The cata- logue of inflammations of the kidneys, salivary glands, liver, &c. abound in the sympathetic phenomena of the other systems. I do not mean the disordered states of digestion and circulation, functions which being naturally connected with the secretions, must unavoidably be disordered

Perspiration is less abundant, because the skin is no longer liable to those exacerbations so frequently detected in the adult; 3dly. The oily substance also is more sparingly supplied : hence the habitual dryness observed in the skin, and, in some cases the chafing of the epidermis, &c. All diseases that imply an increase of this organic sensibility, are much less common, as is exemplified in erysipelas and the different kinds of eruptions; and, whenever these affections occur, they assume a remarkably chronic type ; 5thly. the skin has much less power to resist cold, and it is easily deprived of its caloric, which inces- santly tends to combine with the surrounding atmosphere : thus, heat is always sought after in old age ; 6thly. I am fully convinced that at thai age the skin has not the same power of resisting a temperature superior to that of the body, and that as it easily suffers the interior caloric to escape into a colder atmosphere, it would suffer that from without to penetrate the body. It might be very interesting to repeat, at these two opposed stages of life, the experiments made by the English physicians.

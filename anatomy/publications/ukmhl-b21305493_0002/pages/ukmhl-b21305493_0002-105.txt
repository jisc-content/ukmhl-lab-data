G3 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. Immoveable Articulations. The immoveable articulations sometimes pre- sent indented surfaces, as those of the bones of the cranium, in which numerous asperities are locked together; on other occasions, surfaces in juxta-position, as in the articulation of the tem- poral with the parietal bones, of the two superior maxillary bones with each other ; and again, im - planted surfaces, as in the teeth. All these divisions will be easily conceived, by referring to the following table, which is not the same as that produced in my treatise of the mem- branes. I am induced to believe this presents rather a more useful classification, inasmuch as it displays the two essential points in every kind of moveable articulation; namely, 1st. The connec- tions between the articulating surfaces that charac- terize the orders. 2dly. The number of motions of each, that distinguish the genera. In the im- moveable articulations these are merely orders ; for excepting the surfaces, they do not present sufficient difference to admit of a subdivision.

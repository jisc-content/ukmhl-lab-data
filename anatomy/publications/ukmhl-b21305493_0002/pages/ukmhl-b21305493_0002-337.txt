295 OF ANIMAL LIFE. Vessels. The arteries of the muscles are excessively ap- parent ; they project from the adjoining'trunks, and penetrate the organ through every part of its circumference, but more towards the middle than the ends. At first they curl between the essen- tial bundles, then divide, and through these divi- sions proceed to the secondary skains, there they subdivide and twine amongst the fibres, are finally reduced into capillary tubes, and attend the most minute fibres, where they deposit, by means of the exhalant system, the nutritive sub- stance. Few organs, in proportion to their size, possess more blood than the muscles. This blood, as we shall see, is essentially requi- site to keep up excitement; by this fluid the muscular tissue is coloured, but not in the way that might, at first, be thought, by circulating in the tissue. The circulating or free part, hardly contributes to it; it is that part combined with the muscular tissue, that which contributes to its nutrition that gives the colour ; this will prove it: 1st. the fibres of the intestines contain as much, or even more of the circulating blood, than those of the muscles of animal life, and yet their tissue is most evidently whitish wherever these ve&sels are not met with. â€˜Sndly. In several ani- mals only possessed of red and cold blood, par-

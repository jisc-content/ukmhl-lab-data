The European forms and features are in general the type with which we compare the outward ap- pearance of the inhabitants of other nations. The beauty or deformity of the human races, are, from our ideas, measured by the greater or less distance that separates them from ours. Such, in fact, is the power of habit with us, that we seldom judge in an abstract manner, and in pro- portion as an object is farther removed from what constantly strikes our sight it appears dis- agreeable to us, sometimes even insupportable.

In fact, besides the part that contains the seat of colour, there is evidently one habitually supplied with white fluids, in which they circulate with more or less rapidity, incessantly succeeding each other.

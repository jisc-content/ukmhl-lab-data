They are possessed of two modes of growth ; the one in the longitudinal direction when the ends , are cut, the other in thickness when a single lamina only is removed, which is soon replaced. Whenever a nail drops, the whole of the dermis by which the back of the last pha- lanx is covered, forms a new one from its exter- nal surface. 3dly. The vital powers are equally as obscure in nails as they are in the epidermis, nothing like animal sensibility can ever be traced. The excruciating pains experienced, on their being torn off, exclusively proceed from the sen- sibility of the subjacent pulpy tissue; they may be compared to those produced, by tearing up the hair. There is nothing to be compared with or- ganic sensibility, nothing like interior circulation, and of course no caloric is emitted in the tissue. The horns in animals are nearly of an equal degree of temperature with the atmosphere, whilst other external productions possessed of vital powers in an eminent degree, though shoot- ing the same as horns from the economy retain a degree of temperature equal to that of the body : such are the combs of the European cock, those still more striking of the turkey. Let these pro- ductions be compared with the legs of these species that are covered with scales ; and the deference of temperature will be striking. 4thly.

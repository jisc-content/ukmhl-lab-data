These tubes apparently possess no membrane different from that dense tissue, and from the mucous membrane. Every excretory duct has its vessels. The ureters are evidently provided with arterial branches by the renal, the spermatics, &c. &c. The ductus choledocus is supplied by the hepatic, sienon’s duct by the fascial branch, «fcc. <&c. Dif- ferent nerves, projecting from the ganglions, at- tend the arteries and the corresponding veins; however I have constantly observed, that their ducts are never surrounded with a plexus as strik- ing as that which invests the greater part of the arteries. The excretory ducts chiefly enjoy the proper- ties of the mucous system, by which, in the greatest part, they are formed ; their sympathies also are nearly of the same nature. ARTICLE II.

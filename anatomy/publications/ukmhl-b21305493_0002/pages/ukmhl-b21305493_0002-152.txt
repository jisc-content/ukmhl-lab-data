110 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. From this it results, that this membrane has the general conformation of serous membranes, the shape of a kind of night-cap, as is vulgarly said. There are two parts, the one adhering to, and lining the socket, the other free, and enveloping the pulp ; such, for instance, as the pleurae, that have a costal and a pulmonic side. The pulp and the vessel, although rapt up by this fold, are actu- ally then without the cavity, which is lubricated by a moisture. I found that this moisture, simi- lar to that of the serous membranes, was essen- tially of an albuminous nature : the action of ni- tric acid, of alcohol and caloric clearly proves it. When submitted to the action of one of these agents, particularly the first, the membrane sud- denly becomes white, the albuminous coat that covers it concretes and coagulates, just in the same manner as when a similar experiment'is tried upon a serous substance. The pulp, rather considerable at that age, is suspended like a bunch of grapes, as it were, from the ends of the vessels and nerves. It is over the pulpous part of the membrane of the follicle, and on the surface of its floating end, the first rudiment of ossification is ob- served ; it soon extends, and assumes the shape of the summit of the crown it is intended to form ; that is to say, a cubic form for the grinders, a pointed one for the canine teeth, and for the

DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 847 body, and there is a general increase in tempera- ture ; we feel heat both externally and internally : or again, an additional local exhalation is effected in one part of the skin, and the patient feels heat in that part, as would also a by-stander, by placing his hand upon it; 4thly. To conclude, there are some sympathies belonging to heat, and others to cold. Other parts besides the mucous surfaces and the skin, are liable to experience these sym- pathies : that cool sensation experienced in cer- tain diseases arising from the abdomen, and spreading all over the chest, &c. is well known. The organic properties of the skin are also often sympathetically forced into action. The mo- ment a cold substance is admitted into the sto- mach, whilst the skin is in a state of perspiration, perspiration is instantly suppressed. Hot beverages cause an instantaneous increase of the cutaneous exhalation: an effect so sudden, that it cannot possibly be attributed to an absorption of the fluid on its admission after crossing the lungs into the blood, and subsequently into the exhalents. The production of perspiration in this instance, then, is perfectly analogous to its suppression in the preceding; it is similar to that of fear, or of phthisis, whereby the lungs being affected, act upon the skin, &c. Shall I mention the innume- rable variations observed in this organ in diseases, its dryness, moisture, and abundant perspirations, See. phenomena which are, for the most part.

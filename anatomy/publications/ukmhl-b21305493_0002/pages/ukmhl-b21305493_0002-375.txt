333 OF ANIMAL LIFE. tial condition of muscular contraction ; thus, the habitual motion imparted to every other organ, and especially to the brain, maintains both motion and life. 4thly. To obey cerebral influence, it is not only requisite that the muscle should receive the im- petus of the blood, but also of the red or ar- terial blood. The dark blood is not calculated to maintain motion by its contact. General weakness, the fall of the animal, are the first symptoms of asphyxia, in which the dark blood invades every part. I shall not repeat here the proofs of this assertion, sufficiently explained, I believe, in my researches on the different species of death, but in this respect I shall refer to that book. 5thly. A fluid different from blood, water, oily albuminous fluids, <&c. and still more urine, sour and irritating fluids, solutions of acids, of alkalies, &c. are not calculated to maintain muscular ac- tion; on the contrary, they will paralyze it: injected through the crural arteries in a living animal, when the circulation of the blood has been stopped above by a ligature, they weaken and even anni- hilate motion, as I have frequently been con- vinced. The results in these experiments vary according to the fluid that has been used ; the motions cease after a greater or less interval; they are weakened or totally suspended ; but is there al- ways a striking difference from the natural state ?

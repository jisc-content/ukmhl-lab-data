189 FIBROUS SYSTEM. do not resist alike ; those interposed between the lamellae of the vertebrae resist the longest ; they do not display that yellowish aspect, that semi- transparent appearance common to all the fibrous system that has been boiled ; they remain white, tough, seem to contain much less gelatine, and to be completely distinct in their nature. On being exposed to the action of air, the fibrous system loses its white appearance, by the evaporation of the fluids it contains; it contracts, becomes yellow, partly transparent, and is easily ruptured. If a few days after having been dried, it is again immersed, it will re-assume its white- ness, its softness, and nearly its primitive appear- ance ; so that it might be supposed the whitish appearance is attributable to the water only : this phenomenon applies particularly to the tendons. I have also observed another very remarkable phenomenon, in respect to the latter, which is, that after having been macerated for some time, and then dried, they do not in the process acquire a yellowish hue, but remain particularly white. This undoubtedly must also be the case in respect to the whole svstem. â€¢/ The action of the nitric and sulphuric acids rapidly softens the fibrous tissue, and reduces it to a kind of pulp, blackish in the one, yellow in the other ; the moment this tissue is plunged into the acid, it twists and contracts, in the same manner as in boiling water.

216 , fibkous system* with the synovial capsules; such is the intimacy of these adhesions, that they cannot be destroyed in the adult by the nicest dissection. During in- fancy it is much less, as is particularly seen in the connection existing between the basis of the peri- cardium and the the diaphragm, and which con- nection is such, that in these early years, the two surfaces which are contiguous more than conti- nued, may easily be separated, whilst in the sub- sequent ages it could not possibly be effected. As to the union of the mucous with the fibrous surfaces, whenever they are contiguous they are completely confounded with each other. This is observed in the pituitary membrane, imthe mem- brane of the sinuses, in that of the ear, &c. The pericondrium of the larynx, of the trachea, form but one with their internal membrane: in all these parts the periosteum is so interwoven with the mucous surface that it is impossible to sepa- rate them, they are removed together from the bone which is then left bare. The vas deferens, the fallopian tubes, the ureters, &c. are also most evidently fibro-mucous organs. SECTION II. Organization of the Fibrous Membrane i'} nun linn The fibrous membranes in general have a very tight texture, a remarkable thickness, and are formed of a single sheet. The dura-mater seems to be an exception to this rule in the folds

873 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. If, by a permanent uniformity in the stimu- lating agents, the skin and mucous surfaces were constantly in the same degree of excitement, they would certainly never afford such an ample source of diseases as is obviously exemplified in the foetus which is hardly ever diseased ; because all the exterior causes, which act upon its cutaneous and mucous sensibilities, as heat, the fluids, the parietes of the womb, admit of no varieties until birth. At this period immersed in a new medium, animals, viewed even in a natural state, meet with a greater number of varieties in the stimu- lants, that act upon them, and hence their diseases are much more frequent after birth. In society, where in the number of stimulating agents by which the surfaces intended to be in contact with exterior forms are sometimes tenfold and more, is it to be wondered that diseases should be so disproportionate to those with which the brute creation are affected. SECTION IV. State of the dermoidal System in old Age. Towards the decline of life, the dermoidal sys- tem becomes denser and tighter ; it is softened with difficulty by boiling, and the gelatine ob- tained from it is much less abundant, firmer, and

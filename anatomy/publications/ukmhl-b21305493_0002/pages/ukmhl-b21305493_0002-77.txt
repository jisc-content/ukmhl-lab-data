The compact tissue in flat bones form two external plates of a moderate thickness, between the middle and ends of the long bones, or to that of the short bones. Between these two plates is the cellular texture, generally similar to that in the ends of long bones, a little more flattened, how- ever, commonly thicker towards the ridges or the circumference, frequently wanting in the mid- dle of the bone, where the two compact plates, in close juxta-position, when placed against the light, are transparent. In general, whenever flat bones by the deficiency of cancelli are thin, very powerful muscles meet and compensate by their thick layers for the want of solidity in the bone, as the iliac fossae, the sub-scapulary, the inferior occipital, &c. afford instances of. 3d. The cellular structure always predomi- natesTn the short bones; they are almost entirely formed by it, being merely covered with a slight layer of the compact tissue, and in this respect their organization is similar to that of the heads of the long bones : thus the resistance of the bone de- pends upon the whole,and one part is not more ex- erted than another to prevent fracture. From what has hitherto been stated, the successive mode of solidity in the different bones has been sufficiently elucidated: in the middle of the long bones it is d 2

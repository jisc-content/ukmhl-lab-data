91 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. In that part of the flat bone, where the first rudiment of ossification is displayed, vascular dots are at first observed. The calcareous phos- phate is seen to radiate from the centre to the circumference, the divergent ossified rays are very evident in the bones of the skull. Unos- sified substance, at first, occupies the interstices they leave between them, but these are subse- quently filled up with additional rays, all termi- nating in an uneven process, and without being contiguous to each other, so that by separating an ossified part of a flat bone from the membranous portion to which it adheres, its circumference ap- pears indented or scolloped like the end of a comb. Hence, as we shall perceive, the origin of sutures. In the early periods of ossification, the tenuity of these bones is almost beyond description, they are not as yet possessed of cancelli; at birth but very few of these rudiments of ossification have united, being separated by cartilaginous and mem- branous spaces ; these spaces are more extensive on a level w7ith the angles, than on a level with the ridges, and in general, in the most distant parts from the originally ossified centres. The bones possessed of several of the rudiments, are formed of separate parts, more or less distant from each ; those with a single centre of ossification have one only. Subsequent to birth, these bones extend still more, they increase in thickness and solidity, and

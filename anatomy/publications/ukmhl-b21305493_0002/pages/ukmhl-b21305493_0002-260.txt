FIBROUS SYSTEM. 218 every where extended, except in such parts as are lined with cartilages; its thickness is remark- able in the infant; proportionably thinner in the adult, it gradually acquires more density and tightness. The ancients had figured to themselves this or- gan as extending from one bone to the other, over the articulation, and thus forming a continued bag for the whole skeleton. This idea is incor- rect. In the junctions of bones, the periosteum interweaves with the ligaments that afford it means of communicating, and in this manner only continuity can be conceived: the crown of the tooth, as well as all the bony productions arising from the heads of certain animals, are un- provided with it. The periosteum, in infancy, is slightly united to the bone : and is removed from it with the utmost facility, particularly from the part of the long bones. In the adult, as the calcareous substance has gradually invaded its most internal fibres, the adherence is very obvious ; it is excessively so in the aged subject, in which this membrane, by the progress of ossification, is frequently reduced to a very thin layer. The continual pressure poduced by the contraction of the muscles, may very probably influence this adherence. Divers pro- , jections proceed from the periosteum to the bone ; they are much more numerous in the extremities of long bones and on the short ones, than in the

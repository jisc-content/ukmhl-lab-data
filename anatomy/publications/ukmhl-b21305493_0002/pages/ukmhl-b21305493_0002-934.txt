EPIDEUMOIDAL SYSTEM 892 evaporated, it re-assumes its transparency, returns to its natural state and sensibility, and is restored to the parts. This phenomenon besides is particularly observed in the epidermis of the hand and foot, for in any other part it is hardly ever seen. 2ndly. The epidermis removed from the skin of a corpse and committed to water, also wrinkles, but does not whiten. Left macerating in this fluid, it does not become putrid only, a multipli- city of particles are seen to rise above the water, and which being in juxta-position, form a white pellicle, the nature of which is unknown. After it has been macerated for two or three months, this membrane softens without swelling, and is easily lacerated; but it is never diffused into a pulp, similar to that of other organs that have undergone the same process. 3dly. The epi- dermis will not, like other organs, contract and shrink at the time of ebullition ; hence, whilst by this contraction, the surface of the skin is considerably reduced, the epidermis remains the same, it wrinkles in divers directions. When- ever ebullition has been long continued, this membrane becomes less resistant, is easily torn, but never reduced to gelatine, it does not assume yellowish aspect, is not elastic, as the organs from which a considerable quantity of this sub- stance is obtained ; this tissue, besides, as is well known, will not admit of being tanned, it even forms an obstacle to it ; for when boiled

glandular system. 733 innumerable vessels liberally supply them with fluids. At this period these organs correspond to the re- mittent state in the adult; they separate less fluid, although apparently in constant action. All their receptacles, in fact, would not suffice to contain their fluids, if in a limited time the same quantity were secreted as in the early days of infancy. Does this proceed from the dark blood of their parenchyma at this time not being calculated to provide them with the materials for secretion ? This cause may have some influence, and even this conjecture had struck me before, from having observed the want of power in the dark blood to maintain several other functions. But the essen- tial reason in my opinion is, that, in the foetus, the nutritive motion of composition evidently predominates over that of decomposition; the latter is rather obscure ; for almost every thing conveyed to the organs remains there, and whilst in that situation supplies them with the materials for that rapid increase observed in the body in that early stage of life. Now the secretions being especially intended to evacuate the residue of nutrition, they cannot possibly be very active at that period. Digestion besides, never conveys to the blood any of those principles which, not being calcu- lated for nutrition, must on that account be ex- pelled as they were admitted ; that is to say, with-

Conformation. Each of the organs that contribute to form it has the figure of a thin membrane, lining the whole cavity, repeatedly folded over itself, giving rise to numerous extensions, some of which sur- round the very minute filaments of the cancelli that may be met with in this cavity; the others cross without adhering to any ossified portion from one side of the membrane to the other, the whole of which form cellulae wherein the marrow is contained. i We may then form to ourselves an idea similar to that we have conceived of the cellular organ, namely, that of a spongy body, with cellulae that communicate with each other, the situa-

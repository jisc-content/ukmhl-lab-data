DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 813 spaces of time from the surface of a vessel con- stantly submitted to variable degrees of ebullition? yet the comparison is correct. If the comparative weight of substances evapo- rated during a given time from the body might in general be estimated, even this would vary according to each individual; but to pretend to ascertain in a general manner, what in this com- mon mass of fluids is separately the produce of urine, or of perspiration, would be to show our total ignorance of the nature of the vital powers. We have already admitted, that all the know- ledge we possess respecting the variations in the quantities of perspiration are limited to a few ge- neral ideas ; that for instance, in cold climates and seasons, it is chiefly through the internal emunc- tories the residue of nutrition and digestion is expelled ; whilst in summer and hot climates the cutaneous organ is the principal agent. The skin, on the one part, the kidneys and pul- monary surface on the other, are in this respect always in a reverse state of activity. Physicians are very familiar with this difference in respect to the urine and perspiration ; they know that whenever the one is increased, the other is diminished; that during winter the former is loaded with a number of principles, and that in summer perspiration acquires a saline taste, and other particular characters, derived from

FIBROUS SYSTEM, Anatomists have not viewed the fibrous or- gans in a general light; none have yet formed of them a system separate from the parts in which they are found : they can afford in the actual state of the science, none of those important views so useful to the practice of physic, that dis- play to us each organ resulting from the combi- nation of different systems, the analogy of which we find in the other organs, so that, although very distinct in respect to their functions, these parts are liable to the same diseases, because simr lar systems contribute in their structure. Two years ago I presented several general ob- servations on the fibrous membranes that have paved the way ; but these membranes are only a division of the fibrous system that should be here considered more at large. ARTICLE I. Forms, and Divisions of the Fibrous System. Although all the fibrous organs are absolutely of a similar nature, although the same fibres con-

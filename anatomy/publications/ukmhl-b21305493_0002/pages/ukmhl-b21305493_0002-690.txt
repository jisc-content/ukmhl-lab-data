648 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. Its tissue is not so supple as that of the latter; when dried it is much more brittle; it remains stiff, whilst the serous tissue is moved in every direction on the slightest attempt. It also resists maceration much longer, &c. Properties, The properties of the tissue are displayed in dropsies of the articulations, where the synovial membranes are first much distended, and contract again after they are punctured, an operation^ however, which is rarely performed. It appears, however, that these membranes only admit of a slow and gradual distention : we are aware that when they are abruptly distended in luxations, their parieties lacerate instead of yielding: they reunite again subsequent to reduction. Amongst the vital properties, organic sensibility only is allotted to this system in the natural state, as I have ascertained by my numerous experi- ments on living animals, in which these surfaces laid bare, were excited by several irritating agents. But the increase of vitality that causes inflamma- tion, by increasing this sensibility, so as to produce pain, is observed ; 1st. In wounds, when these membranes are exposed to the contact of air; 2ndly. During the continued irritation they expe- rience from foreign bodies being accidentally formed in the articulation ; 3rdly. In the various affections of the articulating surfaces, &c. .9 u

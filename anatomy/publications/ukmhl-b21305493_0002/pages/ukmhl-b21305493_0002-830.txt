788 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. observable by the deficiency of evaporation. It is in this point of view that the action of air upon the cutaneous organ in a state of perspira- tion should be considered* It borrows nothing from that organ ; it has not the slightest effect upon it, but merely dissolves the fluid rejected by its exhalents. Evaporation is an effect purely accidental, it can only take place after exhala- tion, with which it is in no way connected. In the course of the very same day in*which tempe- rature has undergone no change, the skin will often be dry, moist, wet, and covered with per- spiration. If air act upon perspiration, it is by contracting or relaxing the exhalents, and not by. taking up their expelled fluid. If the skin, like the serous surfaces, formed an imperforated sac, perspiration would be effected either with or without the contact of air. In fact, why should it not be the same thing in respect to the skin, as in what relates to these surfaces ? If the action of air upon the skin be studied in the corpse,- it will be obvious that it produces two distinct effects, according to the state of the subject. If with a free access on all sides, it will dry it, and then this organ, as well as the fibrous organs, assume a transparent aspect, unless it was impregnated with blood at the moment of death, in which case it turns black, or assumes a dark brown aspect. Thus dried; 1st. It is firm and re- sistant, and admits of being bent in every direc-

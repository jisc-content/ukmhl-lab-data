MUCOUS ST S T KM. 531 Blood Vessels. The mucous membranes receive a considerable number of vessels. The remarkable redness by which they are distinguished would be sufficient to prove it, if injections did not: this colour is not every where the same. It is scarcely per- ceptible in the sinus of the face, in the internal ear, where the membranes are almost white, and \ are so very apparent, because their excessive te- nuity suffers the bone over wdiich they are ap- plied to be perfectly distinct. In the bladder, in large intestines, in the excretory ducts, &c. that colour though still very pale, is a little more strik- ing ; in the small intestines, stomach, vagina, in the pituitary membrane, and that of the palate, it is very deep. In the gall bladder it cannot possibly be distinguished, because its mucous sur- face in the corpse is constantly coloured by bile. This hue proceeds from a very intricate net- work of blood-vessels, whose branches, after hav- ing crossed the mucous corion, and being ramified in it, expand into numerous ramusculae over its surface, invest the papillae, and are covered with the epidermis only. It is this superficial situation of these vessels, consequently the deficiency of support in one of their surfaces, that so frequently exposes them to be ruptured by strong commotions, as is the case mm2

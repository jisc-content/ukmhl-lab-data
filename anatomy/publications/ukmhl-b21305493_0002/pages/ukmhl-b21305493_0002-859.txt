Physiologists, in my opinion, have not paid sufficient attention in examining either the bron- chia or the skin, to what is evaporated, and to that which remains. Certain animals^ seem to emit these insoluble principles in a greater portion than man; this is the reason why horses must be curried everyday, and frequently bathed, to clean the skin of matter that cannot be taken up by the air. Fourcroy and Vauquelin have ascertained that phosphate of lime is never found mixed with the urine of these quadrupeds. This sub- stance seems to transude through the skin, from whence it is removed by friction and by water. I do not altogether conceive how the hair could be considered as an emunctory in this instance, it appears to me much more natural to suppose, by analogy, that the matter escapes with perspiration. I consider that in the natural state rain is quite as necessary to animals as to plants, the first never shun it, several even readily meet it; with them it has the effect of a bath, it washes off the saline particles which air could not dissolve, and cleans the skin. The cutaneous exhalents do not seem to be everywhere equally distributed. The face and chest are liberally supplied, for perspiration is co- pious in these parts ; the back and limbs are more VOL.

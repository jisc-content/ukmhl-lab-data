MUCOUS SYSTEM. 548 beverage which has been taken. There are nu- merous cases in which, too much exalted, the sensibility of the lacteals, being no longer con- nected with the food, will hardly take the residue of it, &c. The same phenomenon may be pro- duced by a deficiency of action. In absorption, in fact, there is a medium degree of sensibility in the organ that performs it, above or below which degree this function cannot be affected. All mucous absorbents appear to resort to the thoracic duct. Nerves. 1 i I have remarked, that in every origin of the mucous system in which animal sensibility pre- dominates, and by which we become connected with exterior bodies, cerebral nerves are distri- buted. The pituitary membrane, the tunica con- junctiva, the membrane of the palate, the mucous surface of the rectum, of the glans, of the pre- puce, &c. evidently prove this assertion ; a ner- vous filament proceeding from the ganglia is rarely met with in these parts. These nerves, on the contrary, predominate in the intestines, in every excretory organ, in the reservoirs of the secreted fluids, &c., parts in which organic sensibility is the most striking.

This is not calculated to give to the parts, especially to muscles, that remarkable degree of density displayed during their contractions. 7thly. A deficiency of extension in the fibres is the only unavoidable condition required for the exercising of the contractility of tissue, which is incessantly disposed to act; to cause a fibre to contract, on the contrary, necessarily requires the contact of a mechanical agent. To these proofs, I could add many more, to establish a distinction between the phenomena, which have been con- founded together by the illustrious Helvetian physiologist. SECTION II. Vital Properties. \ ' 1 The greatest number of these properties, take a very important part in the muscles ; we shall first examine those of animal life, after which those of organic life will be considered. Properties of Animal Lfe.â€”Sensibility. Animal sensibility in these organs is of all vital properties, the most obscure, at least, when they are investigated in the natural state.

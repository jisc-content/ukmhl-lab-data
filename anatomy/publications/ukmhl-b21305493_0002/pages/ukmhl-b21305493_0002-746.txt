704 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. their secretion is not increased; 9thly. If the proofs stated by JBordeau, respecting the influ- ence of nerves upon the secretions are properly weighed, it will be seen that they either rest upon false premises, as, section, sleep, &c. or upon erroneous notions. Physicians in general have not attached a sufficiently correct idea to the wordâ€”nervous influence. Experiments prove how far it has been misused. Whenever a nerve has been divided, paralized, or irritated in any man- ner whatever, the functions of the organ it sup- plies are not in the least disturbed ; the influence of the nerves upon the organ cannot possibly be appreciated. I do not assert that it does not ex- ist, but that we know nothing of it, and that we should not employ at random a term to which we cannot attach a precise idea. What word then should we make use of to express the influence of the nerves over the organs of our senses, over the voluntary muscles, &c. if the same be given to define an action completely unconnected with this, and which probably does not exist ? jEcchalents and Absorbents, We are little acquainted with these tubes in the interior of glands, where they are merely con- nected with nutrition.

657 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM, those of the internal obturator, of the psoas, &c., and are completely confounded with those of the flexors; 2dly. On the other hand, it generally lines the periosteum, which in this part is in- crusted with gelatine, and forms a fibro-cartilage. Its mode of connection is similar to that of the articular synovial membrane with the carti- lage of the bone. Sometimes it is reflected over a fibrous capsule, after having lined the tendon : such are, those near to the scapulo-humeral arti- culation. In some instances, after having lined the tendon, they ascend as far as over the fleshy fibres; 'in the internal obturator for instance ; odly. On being reflected from the tendon over the ad- jacent organs, they generally answer to a quan- tity of cellular tissue; but in the sheaths of the flexors they line the fibrous sheaths. In every considerable motion the synovial mem- branes of the tendons are mere or less drawn out, but always less so than those of the serous surfaces. * The great variety of forms which the imperfo- rated sacs of the synovial sheaths present, may be formed into two great divisions; 1st. Some pre- sent round bags, a kind of vesicles: such are those of the supra-spinous, of the psoas and iliac, of the internal obturator, &c. All these membranes are remarkable, inasmuch as they never wholly in- vest the tendon but on one side only; inasmuch as they never form internal folds, or as they are never contained in fibrous sheaths; 2dly VOL.

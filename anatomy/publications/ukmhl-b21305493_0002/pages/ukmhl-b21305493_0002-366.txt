324 muscular system frequently the brain is affected in various kinds of mental alienations; how often do the intelli- gence, memory, attention, imagination, proclaim these affections by their irregular aberrations, without the muscular system having participated. Are not exterior sensations very often altered without the motion being so? The brain is in general intended for three important functions; 1st. It receives the impressions of the external senses, and is in this respect the focus of percep- tion ; 2dly. It is the principle, the centre of vo- luntary motion, which cannot take place without its influence ; Sdly. The intellectual phenomena are essentially connected with the regularity of the life of this viscus,—it is the seat of them as it were. Now one of its functions only may be deranged, and the others remain perfect; it may be a regular principle for motions, and an irre- gular centre for the intellectual phenomena ; it may be deprived of communications through the organs of sensation with outward forms, and yet produce motions, or preside over the intellectual functions, as when our sleep is disturbed by dreams, &c. From what has been stated, it follows that a foetus wholly void of brain, cannot possibly continue to live on leaving the parent’s womb. As animal life does not exist in the foetus, respiration cannot take place, and as the functions are restricted to general circulation, to secretions, to exhalation.

OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 116 , as we are nearer to the earliest years of in- These follicles have precisely the same dispo- sition as those of the first dentition. Like these they form pouches without openings; the al- veolar portion of which adheres to the free and pulpous part, and collects over its surface the first rudiments of ossification to form the crown. The mode of growth is also the same ; that is to say, the increase takes place from the interior to the exterior, in a reverse sense to what is observed in other bones; by which disposition the part of the tooth in immediate contact with foreign bo- dies, being the first formed, has more time to ac- quire that degree of solidity indispensable to the use for which it is intended. In proportion as the secondary teeth grow, their vascular system is seen to increase, and that of the old ones to decrease, proceeding from the sensibility, which being reduced in the former, attracts no more blood, whilst exalted in the lat- ter it strongly attracts that fluid. It is also ob- served, that the partitions of the sockets are re- duced in thickness, and that the roots of the first decay. This twofold phenomenon does not ap- pear to proceed from any pressure of the tooth over the rising one, since in this case the root would only spread and be flattened ; or if it ac- tually were destroyed, some remnants would be found, which is not the case. It is then highly

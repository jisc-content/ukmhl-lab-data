MUCOUS SYSTEM. 491 organ the membranes intended for that organ, and does not thus extend them from one to an- other ; but our manner of conceiving them is better accommodated to this language, which on the slightest reflection will be sufficiently intelli- gible. By thus referring the mucous surfaces to two general membranes, I am not only supported by anatomical inspection, but pathological observa- tion also draws the same line of distinction, and discloses points of contact between the different % portions of these membranes. In the divers ta- bles of epidemic catarrhs, drawn by authors, the whole of one of these membranes is frequently seen affected, whilst the others remain perfectly healthy : it is not uncommon to observe a general affection in the former, in that which extends from the mouth, the nose, and the surface of the eye, to the alimentary canal and the bronchiae. The last epidemic observed at Paris, and with which Pinel was affected, was of this nature, as well as that of 1761, described by Razon ; and the epidemic of 1752, related in the Memoirs of the Society of Edinburgh, was remarkable for a similar phenomenon, but no corresponding affec- tion was then observed in the mucous membrane, which is distributed through the urinary organs and those of generation. Here then we find ; 1st. Analogy between the different parts of the first in the uniformity of the affection; 2dly. A

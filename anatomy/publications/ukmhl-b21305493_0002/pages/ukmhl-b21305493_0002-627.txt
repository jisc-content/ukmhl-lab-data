SEKOUS SYSTEM. 585 the union of its various parts forms the general membrane. According to this author this way of explaining the formation of the peritoneum is applicable to the pleura, the pericardium, and to every similar membrane. But if such were the course nature followedâ€”1st. Why, at whatever age the foetus is examined, are the peritoneum and the serous membranes proportionally as much developed as their corresponding organs ? 2dly. How are the numerous folds of these membranes, as the mesentery, the epiploon, &c. formed? 3dly. Why are there parts in which they are wanting, although these parts are exposed to simi- lar friction as those in which they are observed ? w why, for instance, are the sides of the bladder provided with the peritoneum, whilst its upper part is lined with it ? 4thly. Why is there no serous membrane formed round the large vessels of the arm, of the thigh, &c.s which impress evi- dent motion on the adjacent organs ? why is not the thickness of the serous membranes increased in such parts as are intended for more consider- able motion, and reduced in those calculated for less? 5thly. Why, for instance, is the tunica vaginalis equal in thickness to the pericardium? Gthly. How is it possible that friction should create an organized body within, .whilst externally it always destroys the epidermis ? 7thly. How could the vascular and lymphatic texture of the serous membranes be allied to this supposed origin by

SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 636 sufficient length of time on their respective sur- faces, both are returned to the tide of circulation. Does not this series of analogies, which, admit- ting of a few distinctions only in respect to com- position, so obviously associates synovia with the fluid of the serous membranes, naturally lead us to a very simple consequence, namely, that these two fluids, being analogous in every respect, must be so in their mode of separation from the blood ? Now as it is fully admitted that the humour of the serous membranes is conveyed by exhalation, we are evidently led, by a sequence of deductions, to this, which answers the preceding question: that synovia is actually exhaled from the articulating surfaces. This precise and strict consequence, deduced from invariable and palpable facts, will, I am in- clined to think, be fully admitted, when to the preceding analogies are added that of the mem- branous organs, the essential of the exhalation of synovia. SECTION II. Remarks upon Synovia. Thus separated from the mass of the blood, synovia presents itself under the form of a whitish fluid, viscid and transparent: on flowing from the articulation it is ropy. This unctuous nature

12 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. ture this canal is obstructed, because the whole me- dullary organ is impregnated in this part with gela- tine, and becomes cartilaginous ; but that gelatine being gradually absorbed, without being replaced accomplishes the formation of a new cavity, and the former communication between the superior and inferior parts is again opened. I have observed that in the first stage of life, and as long as the bones remain in a cartilaginous state, the medullary canal is proportionally much shorter than in the adult. At birth, it does not occupy more than the middle third of the bone, the two superior and inferior thirds being origi- nally formed by the cartilaginous portion of each end, then by a reticulated substance placed between this part and the canal. As age advances, its length increases. section n. Of the Flat Bones. The flat bones in general are little connected with locomotion, serving only in this respect for the insertion of muscles which from them pro- ceed to the long bones. They are particularly intended by nature to form cavities, such as those of the cranium, of the pelvis, their conformation rendering them very fit for that purpose. 1 hey vary in number according to the cavity they con-

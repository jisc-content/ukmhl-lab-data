SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. I place this next to the serous system, because it has the strongest resemblance to it. 1st. In respect to its form, which in each of these organs is that of an imperforated sac. 2dly. In respect to its texture, which appears to be essentially cellular. 3dly. To its functions, which consist in alternate exhalation and absorption. What serves to establish a sensible line of . â€¢ demarcation between these two systems is: 1st. That the fluid which lubricates the membranes appears to differ in its composition, although it is very analogous to synovia. 2dly. That in cases of general dropsy, which affects simultaneously the cellular tissue, and all the serous surfaces of the peritoneum, the pleura, &c. the synovial mem- branes are not affected, which indicates a differ- ence of structure, although we are not acquainted with it. 3dly. On the other hand, in dropsies of the articulations, and in those of the synovial capsules of the tendons, there is no concomitant affection of the great cavities. 4thly. The fluid ef- fused into the joints does not resemble that which fills the great cavities similarly affected. Sthly. VOL. II. s s

DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 752 nearly the same in the neck, chest, and abdomen, excepting however the penis, the scrotum, the labia pudendi, and the breast, where it is much thinner than on any other part of the body. 3dly, In the shoulder, arm, and forearm, the corium is nearly uniform, but it is somewhat thicker in the palm than on the back of the hand. 4thly, This thickness is in general much more striking in the thigh, and where there are more muscles to be contained, than in the arm or forearm. In the foot it is also thinner on the upper part than in the sole, where it is thicker than in any other part of the body. Hence we perceive, that al- though every where continuous, the corium varies in this respect in different parts ; and how far the thickness and functions of this organ are con- nected, is easily felt in the hand, foot, and cranium, &c. In all other parts these distinctions are not quite so obvious. The corium is generally thinner in the female than in man; compared in every region, evident distinctions between the two sexes are observed, particularly in the breast, where it is much more delicate in women ; that of the labia pudendi is proportionally thicker than that of the scrotum. To conceive a correct idea of the intimate structure of the corium, its internal surface should first be properly examined after it has been mi- nutely separated from the adipose cellular tissue,

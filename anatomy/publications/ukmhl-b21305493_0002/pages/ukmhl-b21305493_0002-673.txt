631 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. these pretended synovial glands never present a similar developement. In the diseases of articu-> lations, an obstruction, common to all, seems to identify them with the surrounding cellular tissue. As other glands they are not liable to affection distinct from those of this tissue, because they do not enjoy a vitality proper to themselves, and because being merely prolongations only of the adjacent cellular tissue, they partake of its nature and properties, and of course of its various changes. The considerations I have just presented to the reader in a successive order, form, I think, a suffi- cient mass of evidence to resolve the preceding problem, by showing that synovia is not trans- mitted by secretion to the articulating surfaces. Let us proceed to the second mode of trans- mission pointed out by authors. Is Synovia transmitted by Transudation to the Articulating Surfaces ? It was once a generally received opinion that the marrow of the long bones transuded through the pores of their extremities, and through those of the cartilages they are terminated by, to lubri- cate the articulating surfaces. Havers revived that idea, forgotten at the time he wrote : he asso- ciated this source of synovia to that he had placed m the glands, and thus formed of this humour a

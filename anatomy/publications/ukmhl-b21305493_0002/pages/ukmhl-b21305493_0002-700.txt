658 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM, The others, which especially belong to the flexors, and to the tendons crossing the sole of the foot, form at first a kind of cylindrical bag, which lines the canal, half fibrous and half cartilaginous, in which the tendon glides ; they are tthen reflected round it, and completely invest it, forming a sheath, which prevents its being immersed *in sy- novia. This kind of tendinous sheath then actually presents two canals, at the superior and inferior extremities of which are two bags, that unite them together, and thus complete the im- perforated bag. Internal folds, projecting from one canal to the other, are here frequently met with. One is also observed under the tendon of every synovial membrane of the flexors. % Organizationâ€”Properties. The organization of the synovial sheaths of the tendons is perfectly analogous to those of the ar- ticulations. Essentially cellular, the tissue of these membranes has no evident fibre; its softness is striking; they are provided with a small number only of blood-vessels; notwithstanding the con- trary opinion, the absorbents and exhalents are particularly predominant. These filled with blood in inflammation impress upon the membrane a reddish colour, more or less deep. Synovia is not exhaled in that state ; adhesions are even some- times found, as I have observed, in a subject in

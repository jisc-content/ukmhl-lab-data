39 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. by dissolving by the gelatine the action of water reduced to steam, evidently produces that cal- careous saline part. Scheele found that this portion was a neutral salt, with an earthy basis, the phosphate of lime. Phosphorus, when exposed on a fresh and naked bone, gives it a luminous appearance, visible dur- ing night, at a considerable distance. Sometimes it is the whole bone, at other times a part only, that is luminous. I have always observed in the luminous part, an oily exudation, proceeding either from the medullary juice, or the fat of the parts that surrounded the bone. Various facts, not less evident than the pre- ceding, prove, with equal certainty, the existence of a gelatinous substance in bones; 1st. When in their dissolution by the agency of acids they have been deprived of their phosphates, there re- mains a cartilaginous body, flexible, elastic, yel- low when the nitric acid has been made use of, bearing the same form as the bone. Now it is well known that it is the gelatine which chiefly forms the cartilages; 2dly. If, besides, this carti- laginous residue be submitted to ebullition, a great quantity of gelatine will be extracted, it dissolves in water, and may be subsequently pre- cipitated by tan. The bones may even be" de- prived of this substance without a preliminary extraction of the calcareous phosphate. Thus it is, that with bones deprived of every sur-

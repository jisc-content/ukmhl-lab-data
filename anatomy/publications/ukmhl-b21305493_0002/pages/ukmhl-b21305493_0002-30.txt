ANALYSIS. xxii Sect. I.—Free Surface of the Membranes.—Is smooth and polished. —This attribute is not derived from compression.—The organs pro- vided with serous membranes are isolated by this surface.—Its in- fluence over the motions performed by these organs.—Adherences of the serous surfaces.—Their divisions « 583—591 Sect. II.—Adherent Surface of the Serous System.—Uniting means.— The connections between the serous membranes and their organs are frequently altered.—This is owing to the slightness of adherence.— More effectual adhesion - - 591—594 Sect. III.—Serous Fluids.—Their quantity.—Varieties in quantity.—Ex- periments.—Morbid varieties.—Nature of these fluids 594—597 ARTICLE II. Organization of the Serous System. Serous membranes are composed of a single sheet.—The hue.—Thick- ness - - 597—598 Sect. I.—Cellular Nature of the Serous Tissue.—Proofs of this cellular nature —Experiments tried by maceration, ebullition, desiccation, concoction and putrefaction.—Distinctions between cellular and serous tissues . - - 598—-604 Sect. II.—Parts common to the Organization of the Serous System. —Exhalants.—Divers proofs of serous exhalation 604—605 Absorbents.—Proofs of serous absorption. — Experiments. — Origin of these organs . - - 605—608 Blood-Vessels.—The serous membranes contain but few.—Those sub- jacent to these membranes do not belong to them.—Proofs $>08—609 Sect. Ill*—Varieties in the Organization of the Serous System.— Different instances.—Consequences in respect to diseases.—Remarks on the pericardium.—Characters in common- - 609—612 ARTICLE III. Properties of the Serous System. Sect. I. — Properties of the Tissue. — Extensibility. — Less effec- tual than might at first be supposed.—The reason.—Uses of the wrinkles in the serous membranes.—Of their displacement.—Pain resulting from such displacements in inflammation - 612—614 Contractility.—Less than apparently might be supposed.—Actually existing however - - 614—615 Sect.

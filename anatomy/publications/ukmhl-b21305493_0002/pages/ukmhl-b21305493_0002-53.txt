OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 11 torm in consequence of the projections or pro- minent lines observed on the external surface of the bone, which in these parts only acquire a greater thickness. Its parieties are smoother in the middle than in the ends, from which nume- rous cellular filaments already project. In many subjects it is divided by delicate bony partitions arranged horizontally, which in this part almost completely interrupt continuity, and seem to di- vide this substance into two or three very distinct parts. The medullary canal is not only intended to contain the medullary organ, and to protect it, but also to give a greater degree of resistance to the bone ; for it has been sufficiently proved, that of two cylinders, equal in respect to the quantity of matter they are composed of, but one of which is hollow, consequently of larger diameter than the other which is compact, the former is capable of opposing more resistance than the latter, be- cause it will bend, and is consequently fractured with more difficulty. Compact cylinders, equal in diameter with the long bones, would have pre- vented, by their weight, the motions of the limbs, whilst other cylinders of a similar weight, but unprovided with a cavity, would not have pre- sented a sufficient surface for muscular insertions. The union of lightness, with extent of surface in the long bones, is then an important advantage derived from the existence of the medullary canal. When callus begins to form at the point of frac-

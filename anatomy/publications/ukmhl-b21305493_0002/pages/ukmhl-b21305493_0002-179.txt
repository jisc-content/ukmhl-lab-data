Who is not aware, that the progress of caries is so much the more rapid, as the bone contains a greater quantity of cancelli ? This phenomenon is not owing to the nature of the tis- sue, but to its greater abundance, since it is more striking in proportion as the medullary system predominates. Now, as this sympathises in all its affections, it imparts to them a degree of ra- pidity they are not possessed of in the compact tissue, where the medullary system is wanting. SECTION IV. Dev elopement. This membrane exists in the cartilaginous state in the centre of the long bones ; but then it ful- fils the office of the nutritive parenchyma; for the gelatine that is exhaled in it, and which being accumulated in a considerable quantity in its cel- lulae, gives to the bone a homogeneous appearance, and prevents it from being distinguished. Dur- ing the process of ossification, this substance is absorbed, and the medullary cavity is formed, the

MUCOUS SYSTEM* 502 by their mode of sensibility and their structure to exterior forms, are interposed. To these limits the excitation of these forms stop; their influ- ence can never exceed them ; as long as they ex- tend to them only the other organs are unaffected by them. We might suppose that the exquisite sensibility with which each is endowed, is a sen- try, as it were, nature has placed on the bounda- ries of the organic empire of the soul, to warn it of approaching danger. ARTICLE II. Organization of the Mucous System, SECTION i. Tissue proper to that Organization. Two things in the tissue proper to the mucous system are still to be considered, namely ; 1st. A layer of greater or less thickness forming the principal constituent part of this tissue, and which, through analogy with the cutaneous co- rion, may be named mucous corion; 2dly. A multiplicity of small projections from its surface, called villi or papillae. As to the epidermis it is covered with, it shall be noticed when treating of the cutaneous epidermis. This tissue has not the slightest similitude with the colouring substance of the skin, interposed between the papillae and the epidermis. In fact, it is sufficiently known, that in black, as well as in white subjects, this tissue is of a very bright red colour which it bor- rows from the blood vessels.

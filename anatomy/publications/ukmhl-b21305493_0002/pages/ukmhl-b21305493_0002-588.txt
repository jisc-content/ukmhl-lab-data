546 MUCOUS SYSTEM. Absorbents. The absorption of the mucous membrane is evidently proved ; 1st. By those of the chyle and beverages on the surface of the intestines, of the venereal matter on the glans and tube of the urethra, of the matter of the small-pox when the gums are rubbed with it, of the serous part of the bile, of urine, and of the semen, during their abode in their respective recipients ; 2dly. When from paralysis of the fleshy fibres that terminate the rectum, the faeces are accumulated in the extre- mity of that organ, they often acquire a degree of hardness, probably the effect of an absorption of the humours that are there obstructed; 3dly. There are several instances of urine being nearly totally absorbed by the mucous surface of the blad- der in irremoveable obstructions of the urethra; 4thly. If the air of a large jug, loaded with exhalations of turpentine, be inspired through a tube, so that these vapours should act only over the mucous surface of the bronchia, urine acquires that peculiar smell constantly produced by using that substance, the emanations of which have been conveyed to the blood by absorption, &c. In whatever manner this absorption may take place, it does not appear to be constantly nor un- interruptedly carried on, like those of the serous

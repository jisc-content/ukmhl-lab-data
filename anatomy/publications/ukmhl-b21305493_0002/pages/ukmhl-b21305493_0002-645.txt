603 SEROUS SYSTEM. to state, as a general principle, that the perito- neum is above all serous membranes the most liable to it. Notwithstanding that the utmost analogy be- tween the cellular and serous systems is proved, by the considerations above-mentioned, yet there is still a real difference. In the first place, their exterior appearance is not the same: then there is something in their intimate nature we are unacquainted with, and which also differs; for whenever two organs are similar in structure, they are liable to the very same affections. Now there is a disease of the serous surfaces which is never observed in the cellular system ; I mean those inflammations slow in their progress, and which I have just mentioned, a disease that ought rather to be ranked in any other class than that of phlegmasiae, and which is particularly characterized by the small tubercles attendant upon it. Authors who have not paid a sufficient attention to this affection, have termed it chroyic enteritis in the peritoneum, chronic inflammation in the pleura, &c. although per- fectly unconnected with any subjacent organ, except at an advanced period ; when it is propa- gated through the cellular tissue, it is exclusively seated in the serous membranes, and is an affec- tion proper to these membranes; as the miliary eruptions are to the cutaneous surface, and aphthae to the mucous, &c. To these distinctions

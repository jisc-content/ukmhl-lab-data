MUSCULAR SYSTEM 296 ticulariy frogs, the muscles are nearly white, and yet a number of blood-vessels overrun this white tissue. 3rdly. I have observed, that in animals that have been strangulated, the colouring matter does not change its hue, and, undoubtedly, be- cause it is only gradually combined with the mus- cles in nutrition ; that on the contrary, if in such cases, a muscle be divided at the last moments of life, whilst the veinous fluid is still circulated through the arterial system, that blood will flow in black streams from the arteries of the muscles, and the tissue itself remain red. This curious ex- periment, which I have pointed out in another work, is made on strangulating an animal by compressing the trachea, or by any other means that may prevent the air from circulating through that tube, whilst the muscles are exa- mined. When a muscle has remained for some space of time exposed to the contact of air, es- pecially to that of oxygen, its reddish hue be- comes evidently brighter. In some instances, the vessels of the muscles suffer the blood they contained to escape, hence the different hemorrhages particularly remarkable in scorbutic subjects, and sometimes in putrid % fevers; seldom or never in such diseases as are characterized by an increase of vitality. Im- pregnated with blood in accidental hemorrhages, especially in the false aneurisms caused by effu- sion, the muscles are partly deprived of their mo-

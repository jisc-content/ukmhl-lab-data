837 DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. hemiplegia is seldom detected; sensationis extinct, but in an isolated part only. I have remarked that the existence of paralysis is an additional proof that nerves have not the slightest influence over cutaneous exhalation and capillary circula- tion, since these two functions, as I have said be- fore, as well as those attended with loss of motion, are regularly affected in such cases. When the nerves in the limb of an animal have been cut, to deprive that limb of motion, and subsequent to this operation an irritating agent is applied, the skin will inflame as usual. When animal sensibility is excited, are the pa- pillae in a state of erection, by which the sensa- tion is rendered more lively ? WThat has been said respecting the mucous surfaces may be ap- plied here. This erection is an ingenious idea of some physicians, and quite unsupported by obser- vation : examined through the magnifying glass, the papillae constantly appear to be in the same state. Why should not the skin be like a denuded nerve, like the eye, ear, &c., wherein these kind of erections have never been thought of. Animal contractility is entirely unconnected with the cutaneous organ, which only undergoes voluntary motion from the agency of the panni- culus carnosus. Properties of Organic Life. The cutaneous organ is endowed with organic

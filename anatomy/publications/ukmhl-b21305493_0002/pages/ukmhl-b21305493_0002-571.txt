In respect to composition, there exists an essen- tial distinction between blood and the secreted fluids. In this respect, on the contrary, the ex- haled fluids, such as the serum, &c. approach it much more. Another very evident proof that all the mucous fluids are intended to be expelled, is, that as soon as they have stagnated for some time in a considerable quantity over their respec- tive surfaces, they cause a painful sensation, which nature relieves by various means. Thus coughing, the constant result of an accumulation of mucous fluids in the bronchia, expels them : thus vomiting fulfils the same office in disorders of the stomach, in respect to the fluids it had accumulated, causing, by their presence, a sen- sation of weight, and even of pain, although the membranes are not affected. We can cough at will, because that function is performed by the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles ; therefore medical practice has sought for no artificial means of producing it. But as vomiting is not effected in the same manner, and it often happens that the mucous juices, by considerably fatiguing the sto- mach, do not irritate it sufficiently to occasion contraction, art has resorted to various eme- tics.

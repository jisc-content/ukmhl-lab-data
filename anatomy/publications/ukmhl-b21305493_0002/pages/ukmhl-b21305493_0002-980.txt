None whatever flows when the latter is divided, although several authors have pretended the reverse. Besides, if this fluid is in the form of a dew, as upon the serous surfaces, it would not be perceived the hair shoots from the small cylindrical bag I have just mentioned. In the end, a small swelling, some- times hardly perceptible, at other times more so, although less considerable than has been said, is observable. This swelling is of the same nature and hue as the hair itself: it adheres to the tubes probably by the vessels, and, perhaps, by the nerves it receives from it. The hair that shoots from it crosses the canal without adhering, as I have said before, to its parietes, passes along with it through the oblique pores of the dermis, forsakes it in the epidermis, and projects outwardly. All authors have pretended that the epidermis was not perforated by the hair, but merely ele- vated and converted into a sheath that attends it the whole of the length. This assertion is incor- rect. In fact; 1st. The hair is quite as thick within the canal, from whence it emerges, as it is without it. 2dly. This canal being open at the extremity opposed to the skin, the whole hair is easily withdrawn, as I have said before, and without experiencing the slightest resistance, which would otherwise unavoidably be the case. In lacerating the fold of the epidermis, it appears

224 FIBROUS SYSTEM. formation of bone ; it contributes only to that of callus; it forms a kind of limit that confines the progress of ossification within its natural bounds, and prevents it from straying by irregular aberra- tions. Does it p^egare ^he ^lood intended for the nutrition of the ©£ga»s ? Experiments are insuffi- cient to resolve this question; but it may be as- serted that the vital properties it is possessed of, are by no means calculated to accelerate the cir- culation of the blood conveyed to the bone, as some authors had thought. Besides, it appears to me that the periosteum, in respect to the bones, has been examined in too exclusive a manner; it is no doubt indispensable to bones, but it may also act a more important part still, in respect to the fibrous organs. If na- ture has so completely provided* the* system of bones with this organ, it probably was because, as I have said, it found in that system a general, so- lid, and resistant support, that enables it to resist the various powers exercised upon it by the whole fibrous system,—a force that is itself imparted to this last system. Such is the new point of view in which the periosteum ought to be considered, and which leads more readily to general considera- tions than that in which Duhamel, Fourgeroux, &c. have considered this membrane.

929 SYSTEM OF TFIE HAIR. Eyebrows. Over the arch which completes the orbit, a quantity of hair, more or less abundant, tracing part of a circle, shading the eye, and protecting this organ from the too powerful impression of luminous beams, is observed. In persons of a dark complexion, the hairs of the eyebrows are placed closer together than in such as are fair: more abundant inward, the two eyebrows are sometimes joined together and shade the root of the nose. More sparingly scattered toward the ends, they terminate into a point, and all are directed outwardly; sometimes to- wards the internal part these organs assume a straight direction ; they hardly ever exceed half an inch in length, excepting in some extraordinary cases. The colour in general is similar to that of the hair, but it sometimes varies; they are firmer, more resistant than these, and are larger; if they were longer they would curl like those about the organs of generation, the nature of which they partake. The eyebrows have evidently two distinct motions, 1st. They may be depressed, and drawn inward, forming an obvious arch over the eye. 2ndly. They may be raised and separated by ex- panding the circle of the orbit. The distance be- tween these two reverse motions nearly measures 3 o VOL. II.

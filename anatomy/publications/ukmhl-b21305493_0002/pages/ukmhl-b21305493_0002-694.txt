652 SYNOVIA E SYSTEM. borrow from the synovia, is, as I have stated, remarkably adapted to this use. Natural Developement. In the foetus, and in the infant, the major part of the synovial membranes are proportionally much wider than in the subsequent ages; because the articulating surfaces are more extensive in the cartilaginous than in the osseous state; but then they are remarkable for their excessvie tenuity .jThe synovia is not, as the serous fluids are at that stage of life, more unctuous and firmer ; it even seems to be less so. It is not very abundant previous to birth, undoubtedly because the motions are much restrained. I have observed, that as age advances this membrane grows tighter and denser: it partly loses its whitish appearance, turns grayish, and less synovia is exhaled from it This membrane is not like the serous surfaces, liable to dropsies : the degree of rigidity it acquires contributes to render motion painful. It never ossifies unless by accident. The phosphate of lime, which by degrees invades the cartilages, never incrusts this membrane. There is no instance, I believe, of a bone being left bare in an aged subject.

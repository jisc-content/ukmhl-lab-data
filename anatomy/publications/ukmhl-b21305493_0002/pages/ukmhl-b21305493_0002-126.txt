I 84 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. serve; and when they have already acquired a de- gree of consistence much superior to that of all that surround them. Now this is merely the first degree of the cartilaginous state, for the parenchyma of nutrition assumes a cartilaginous character as soon as it begins to be impregnated with gelatine, and, in fact, it is impregnated with this substance from the moment it acquires more consistence, since it is this substance that gives to it the de- gree of consistence, and on this account, an ex- istence distinct from the surrounding parts. If, in the early periods of conception, this cartilage be softer, if it diffuse under the finger, if even it partly bear a mucous appearance, it is because it does not contain a sufficient proportion of gela- tine, and that the nutritive parenchyma still predominates ; in proportion as we advance in age its quantity increases, and for this reason the cartilaginous state is more evident. Hence it follows there are three periods in the developement of bones; the first it shares in com- mon with every other organ ; the mucous predo- minates ; the two others, especially, characterize these organs. In these the cartilage and the bone predominate. Let us examine their phenomena. Cartilaginous State. All bones prior to assuming this regular form, are of a cartilaginous nature. This cartilaginous

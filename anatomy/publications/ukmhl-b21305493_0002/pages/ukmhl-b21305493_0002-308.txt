FIBRO-CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 266 SECTION II. State of the Fibro-Cartilaginous System in the subsequent Ages. This system gradually acquires consistence as age advances. In old age it grows hard, yielding with difficulty from the peculiar nature its nutritive substances assume. To this circumstance must be referred; 1st. The stiffness and inflexibility of the spine, in which the fibro-cartilages maintain the component parts in a state of immobility as it were ; 2dly. In part the deafness which affects the aged subject, the tympanum being incapa- ble of vibrating and of reflecting sounds; 3dly. His nostrils admitting of less dilatation, their fibro-cartilages opposing more resistance to the muscular effort, which itself is also reduced; 4thly. The difficulty that attends the gliding of tendons, their sheaths being much stiffer. In old age, the fibro-cartilages have in general less tendency to ossification than the cartilages properly so called. I have never seen this pheno- menon in the membranous ones: in such subjects it may proceed from that particular texture, and even from the difference of their component principles, or from the small quantity of gelatine they are found to contain.

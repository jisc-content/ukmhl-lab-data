255 FIB RO-C A UTIL ACINOUS SYSTEM. the great powers with which the different organs of this system are endowed : hence again ; 1st. The solidity with which the vertebrae are secured together; 2dly. The difficulty with which the fibro-cartilages of the knee, of the jaw, of the clavicle, &c. are ruptured or lacerated; 3dly. The resistance which the ulna opposes to the in- ferior luxations of that bone, luxations which in strong pronations have the utmost tendency to take place, and which cannot be effected without the rupture of this fibro-cartilage. I have wit- nessed an instance of such a displacement that had never been reduced, in which the fibro-carti- lage had completely disappeared; 4thly. On bending the real cartilages they will break ex- actly like a radish ; these organs, on the con- trary, bend in every direction, and resist the agents that distend them ; 5thly. Imprudent men are seen lifting up children by the ears, the fibro- cartilages of that organ sustaining the whole weight of the body. I am convinced those of the nose would bear the same attempt; Gthly. It is sufficiently known, that in aneurisms of the tho- racic or abdominal aorta, the bodies even of the vertebrae are much sooner destroyed, and conse- quently that they afford less resistance than their uniting substances. The cartilaginous part seems interposed, as it were, in the fibres, the interstices of which it fills up* It is very evident, particularly in the arti-

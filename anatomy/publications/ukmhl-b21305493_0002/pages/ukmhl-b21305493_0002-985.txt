SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. 943 We are quite ignorant of the nature of this internal substance, it is however to be presumed, that it is composed of the most minute vessels, in- closed by the common envelope of the epidermis, and containing the colouring substance which stag- nates in these vessels, or at least only undergoes a slow process of nutrition. Amongst these vessels, are there any, which, as is observed in the skin, open outwardly to expel fluids? Several physi- ologists, have conceived that there are, and in this respect, they have considered the hairs as ac- tual emunctories. I do not believe such opinions are supported by any anatomical fact ; but the plica polonica, a very singular disease, in which blood flows from the hair on its being cut, clearly proves that these productions contained exhalents in the natural state, and which being dilated by the disease, contain a fluid, before foreign to them. It is besides beyond a question, that the ex- halents of this system, much less active than those of the skin, cannot so effectually serve as an emunctory. What has been related respect- ing absorption from the vessels of the hair, I con- sider as wholly without foundation. From this statement respecting the internal substance of hair, it appears to be grounded upon analogy with the rete mucosam of the skin, and like this, it results from two different species of vessels, in some of which the colouring sub- stance stagnates, others giving exit to fluids, in

Each is possessed of a vitality proper to itself, which is the result of a peculiar modification of its vital powers; a modification which necessarily commands one in circulation, nutrition, and temperature. In no part, what- ever, are the sensation, motion and process of nutrition perfectly alike, unless they both belong to the same system ; each organ performs, on a minute scale, the phenomena effected at large in the economy; each selects in the circulatory tide the nutritive substance proper to it, digests that food, rejects into the mass of the blood the heterogeneous part of it, and appropriates that fit for its nutrition: it is digestion in miniature. The * ancients, no doubt, intended to convey an idea of that truth, so brilliantly illustrated by Bordeu, that the womb was an animal living within another. It is then a very important use of the serous membranes to contribute to the indepen- dence of the vital powers and functions of different parts, by separating the respective or- gans. Let us not forget to consider under the same point of view, the damp atmosphere that inces- santly surrounds them, an atmosphere analogous to that formed by the cellular tissue round vari- ous other organs : in this atmosphere every mor- bid emanation from the organ is lost, without reaching the others. In the cellular system

MUCOUS SYSTEM. 543 we may be sure that they have been inflamed. There is, as I have said, a proportionate scale of colour for the mucous system. It is of conse- quence then, in dissection,to have a correct know- ledge of this scale, by which the degrees of inflam- mation may be determined. Exhcilants. Is there any exhalation at all in the mucous surfaces? The analogy with the skin seems to admit of it; for it is well proved that perspira- tion is not a transudation through the inorganic pores of the cutaneous surface, but is really emit- ted by vessels of a peculiar nature, and continued with the arterial system. It appears, at first, that the pulmonary perspi- ration, from the mucous surface of the bronchia, so very much connected with that of the skin, which lessens or increases accordingly as this in- creases or lessens, the matter of which in all pro- bability is of the same nature ; it appears, I say, that the pulmonary perspiration is in great part at least, effected through the agency of the ex- halant system, and that if the combination of the oxygen of the air with the hydrogen of the blood contributes to produce it during the act of respi- ration, it is in a small quantity only, and merely the watery part. Besides this last hypothesis of the modern chemists, contradictory to the pro-

OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 94 anatomists have too long neglected. The gene- ral growth in stature, is completed with the pro- cess of ossification, and it even appears that both cease nearly at the same time ; but increase of bulk is still for a long time continued ; if we only compare the slender and eniacmted frame of a youth of eighteen, with the well proportioned form of a middle aged man, the difference is striking. Bones follow the general law; their nutrition, in respect to bulk, is still continued, when that in the longitudinal sense has subsided. It appears in this instance, that the vessels which enter the apertures of the first and second orders, have hardly any thing more to do with the pro- cess of nutrition, the materials for which are sup- plied from those of the third. Now, as we are perfectly aware that these very superficial vessels, are lost in the external fibres of the bone, and do not penetrate into the interior, it must be con- ceived ; 1st. how growth being outwardly con- tinued, the bone must increase in thickness; 2dly. how this increase especially operates upon the compact tissue, whose thickness is in a direct pro- portion with the age, as is easily ascertained by comparing the different bones in the infant, with those of the adult, and of the aged subject. This external increase has led to a supposition that the periosteum especially contributed to it by the ossification of its lamellee; but in the

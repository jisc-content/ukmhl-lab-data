epideumoidal system. 911 nail, a kind of bag would be left towards the edo'e. Some authors have stated, that the ex- tensor tendon is continued so far, but it is easy to perceive it does not exceed the tubercle that terminates the back part of the phalynx. The nail does not extend to this tubercle; a space of a quarter of an inch is left between them. The concave surface of the posterior part of the nail corresponds to the same substance as the middle part. This middle part is left exposed in its convex surface, which is smooth and whitish in the back part, where this hue is observed in the form of a half moon, but of a reddish colour in most of its extent, a colour that does not belong to it, but which it borrows from the subjacent tissue. In the sides the skin partly covers this surface, lines it, and terminates by continuing along the con- cave and free surface we have described. Thus the epidermis forms, in this part, a small ridge, which is on each side a continuation of that pre- viously mentioned; then it unites with the nail, and adheres to its lateral ridge, with which it is identified. The concave surface of this middle part is secured in front by the epi- dermis, which, after having lined the extre- mity of the fingers, and on reaching the part where the nail begins to be confined, separates from the dermis, and proceeds to adhere all along

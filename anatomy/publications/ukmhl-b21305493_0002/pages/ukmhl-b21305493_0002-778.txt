Organic affections of the liver and kidneys are as rare in the infant as they are common in the adult. Then it is that what are so improperly called lymphatic glands, the brain, &c. af- ford to pathological anatomy a full scope for enquiry; for it should be observed that the or- gans which are the most active at a certain stage of life, are precisely the most liable to acute and chronic diseases at that age, whilst those whose functions are still obscure are seldom affected ; i 5thly. Surgeons are aware that sarcocele, hy- drocele, varicocele, and the whole vocabulary of the diseases of the testes, are as rare previous to the age of puberty, when no other func- tion is effected in these glands but that of nu- trition, as they are frequent in the subsequent years.

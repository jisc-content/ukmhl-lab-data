Instead of this substance, Fourcroy found nothing but a softish tissue in the blood of the foetus, without the least consistence, and gelati- nous as it were. Now the blood seems to be the reservoir for fibrine ; 2dly. The power and energy of contractions are generally proportionate with the quantity of this principle in the muscles. Now this energy is very deficient in the early age; 3dly. These muscles do not twist and con- tract so much on burning as those of the adult. In two or three different instances, I have ob- served that their tissue, on being applied to burn- ing coals, swelled in the same manner as gelatine subjected to the same experiment. In general it appears that this last substance is substituted in muscles to the fibrous substance that is formed afterwards. Those who attend dissecting- rooms, have undoubtedly observed, that under similar circumstances the muscles of young sub- jects are longer in putrefying than the greatest part of other substances, and that in this process they emit a less offensive smell. We are aware that veal broth becomes sour much quicker than that of beef. It is always white, and has never that dark colour observed in the others. It stiffens much quicker and boils much sooner, either by the naked fire or by any fluid. The juice ex-

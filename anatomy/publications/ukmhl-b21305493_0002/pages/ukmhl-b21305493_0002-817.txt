Thepe" tectriee of adynamic fevers bear a different aspect; but they also proceed from an extravasation of blood in the cellular tissue, in the small pores which open on the exterior surface of the corium to give a passage to the vessels, to the hair, &c.; the more prominent the small bodies just men- tioned the rougher the skin. They are in ge- neral more frequently met with in the limbs and back, than on the anterior surface of the trunk. The limbs contain a larger quantity of them in the parts of extension than in those of flexion. We conceive by a fine skin, one in which the corium is smooth on its external surface, and where these tubercles are not to be met with. This last arrangement is in general more observ- able in females than in men. Very frequently the epidermis with which these projections are covered, will exfoliate on a level with them, particularly from strong friction, which contri- butes so much the more to make the skin uneven, hard and rough, wherever they exist, and might even lead to a belief that they are formed of the epidermis, which in every in- stance is merely accessory. Wherever the epidermis is very thick, as in the palms of the hand and soles of the feet, if does not admit

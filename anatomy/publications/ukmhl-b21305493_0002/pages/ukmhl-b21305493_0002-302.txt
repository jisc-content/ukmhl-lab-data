FIBROCARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 260 they are twisted in different ways; 3dly. In those of the trachea when they are compressed, or divided longitudinally, we separate the di- vided part, as is practised in tracheotomy, for the purpose of extracting a foreign substance. It fulfils an important office in that kind of vibration of the former organs in the per- ception of sounds • of the latter, in the pro- duction of voice; and 4thly. It is in conse- quence of elasticity that the articulating fibro- cartilages serve as a kind of cushions, which, by compressing and swelling again, accommodate the motions of the bony surfaces to which they correspond ; 5thly. That those of the vertebrae, in particular, depressed during the day, re-act during rest, and thus render the stature in the morning in some degree superior to that at night. Finally. In the sliding of tendons over their fibro-carti- © lages, the elasticity of the latter promotes mo- tion in an evident manner. This elasticity in the fibro-cartilages is united with a very remarkable degree of suppleness, for they will bend in every direction without break- ing. By the first property they belong particu- larly to the cartilaginous system ; by the latter, they approach the fibrous : it is by no means asto- nishing that, being by their tissue as intermediate to these two systems, they should likewise be so by their properties.

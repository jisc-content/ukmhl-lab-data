There is not in the powers of contraction of the muscles we are viewing the waste that is so very remarkable in those of the other muscles; the force is nearly in proportion to the exciting cause, and the distinction of this cause both in absolute and effective could not be applied here ; only more contractile power is required accord- ingly as the substance expelled from a hollow ' muscle is fluid or solid. This explains why, in the large intestines, the longitudinal fibres are more characterized than tbose of the small in- testines ; why the rectum particularly, in which the fseces have their utmost degree of solidity, display these fibres still more conspicuously than in the colon and coecum, although under a different form ; why in diarrhoea the slightest con- traction will empty the intestines, whilst fre- quently to expel very solid excrements, the sen- sible organic contractility of the rectum being deficient, the assistance of the abdominal muscles

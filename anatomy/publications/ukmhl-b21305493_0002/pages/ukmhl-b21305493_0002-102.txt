60 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. Moveable Articulations—Considerations respecting their Motions. j I divide the moveable articulations into four kinds, the characters of which are borrowed from the different motions they perform. To form a proper idea of this division, it is requisite that the articulating motions in general should be first known. They may be subdivided into four spe- cies, namely, 1st. Opposition. 2dly. Circum- duction. Sdly, Rotation. 4thly. Gliding. 1st. The motion of opposition is that performed in two opposite directions; for instance, from flexion to extension,—from adduction to abduc- tion, and thus reciprocally. This motion is ge- neral or limited. It is general when performed in every direction, as above stated, then in those they include ; limited, when there are only flexion and extension, adduction and abduction, &c. The femur, in its articulation, is possessed of a general motion of opposition ; the tibia, in its articulation performs a limited motion of opposition. <2dly. Circumduction is the motion by which the bone describes a kind of cone, the summit ot which is in the superior articulation, the basis in the inferior one ; so that this organ is successively a state of flexion, of adduction, of extension, and of abduction, according to the motion by which it began, and describes also every other motion

CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM, 156 SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Cartilaginous System. The cartilages contain cellular tissue, although, from the want of space between their fibres in the natural state, it cannot be ascertained without di culty ; in fact, the formation of granulations in the wounds in which they are concerned, and ebullition, which, after having deprived them of gelatine, leaves a membranous and cellular resi- due, sufficiently prove the existence of this sub- stance, disclosed, besides in a very conspicuous manner by particular pathological states, in which gelatine, less abundantly separated in car- tilages, has ceased to provide them with their ha- bitual degree of solidity, leaving a soft and fre- quently a spongy tissue. No blood-vessels can be distinguished in these fibres. They are supplied by the exhalant sys- tem, with white fluids only ; but as this system is continued with the arteries of the adjacent parts, the moment its organic sensibility is exalted by morbid causes, and that by these means it becomes connected with the red globules of the blood, it is also disclosed; these globules penetrate it with fa- cility, and hence the red aspect w hich cartilages then display, seen in inflammation, wounds, &c. It is the very same phenomenon that is observed when the

When one is active the others are in a passive state. It might be thought there was but one sum of vitality granted for all, and that one could not partake of more without the others enjoying less. To this law the order of digestion is submitted. In the first stage, the salivary glands pour out an abundant quantity of fluids ; in the next, the parietes of the stomach fulfil this office ; in the third, when the chyle passes into the small intestines, the liver and the pancreas are particularly active ; in the fourth, the mucous glands of the large intestines supply their fluid, and finally the kidneys also act their part in expelling the residue of the fluids. It is im- possible that all the glands should act at the same time: in this respect they may be compared to some exterior motions^ in which some muscles are at rest, whilst others contract. The most im- proper time for coition is during digestion, be- cause then we compel the mucous, hepatic, pan- creatic secretions, &c. to accord with those of the testes. The secretion of one gland, in diseases, can only be increased at the expence of the others ; a fact that is proved by daily observation. Some advantage, as I have said, might be de- rived from this remark, by producing in the dif-

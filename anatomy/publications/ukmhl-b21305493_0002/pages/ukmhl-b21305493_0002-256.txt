FIBROUS SYSTEM. 214 anatomists have asserted, an extension of it. They are not lamellae, which, according to the vulgar expression, have, by separating from the mem- brane, produced by their intersection the spongy tissue. This is another substance, distinct in its vitality and properties. By submitting the corpus cavernosum to ebul- lition, I have evidently made this distinction : the external membrane acts like all other fibrous or- gans ; it thickens, becomes yellowish, semi-trans- parent, then diffuses more or less into gelatine ; the spongy tissue on the contrary remains white, soft, does not increase in bulk, nor contract when submitted to the action of fire ; in a word, it presents an aspect that cannot be compared with that of any other tissue subjected to the same experiment. Maceration also serves to distinguish these tis- sues from each other. The first yields but slowly, its fibres remain for a long time distinct; they still retain their natural disposition when the second is already reduced to an homogeneous pulp of a reddish appearance, in which nothing fibrous, nothing organic, can be distinguished. It appears in general, that the spongy tissue of the corpora cavernosa is their essential part; that in which the important phenomena of erection are produced, that which is animated by the peculiar motion that distinguishes it from all other organs.

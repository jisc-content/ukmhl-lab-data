449 OF ORGANIC LIFE. hilar tissue is sufficient. In fact, the serous sur- faces have nothing interposed between them and the organic muscles but this tissue as a medium of union : their life is by no means connected with that of the latter, since, as we shall perceive, they are often separated, and yet they may transmit the excitement. The pericardium and the peritoneum, on being irritated in their parts corresponding to the organ intended to be moved, cause it to contract. This fact has been observed, even by those who have made but few experiments; generally it is in this manner that the heart, the stomach, the intestines, the blad- der, &c. are stimulated. By gently moving the excitant over the serous surface, so that no mo- tion is communicated to the fleshy fibres, an effect is produced. Simple contact, however, does not suffice to transmit the irritation; for instance, by leaving the external sheet of the pericardium applied over the heart, and then exciting it, the organ remains unmoved. If the peritoneum be separated from the bladder, every cellular attachment is torn ; if it be then re-applied to the organ, and excited, the same state of immobility will be observed. Whenever the interposed membrane that re- ceives the excitement is diseased, the contracti- lity is invariably altered. The same exciting cause produces slow or rapid contractions accordingly as the affection exalts or reduces the sensibility of VOL. II. G G

MUSCULAR SYSTEM 416 traction seems to increase with the thickness, arising from a superabundance of substance sup- plied by nutrition. It is this energy that produces these strong pulsations felt upon the ribs, the force of the pulse, &c. Contractility. This is proportionate with extensibility, and is frequently brought into action in the natural state. It is in virtue of this power that the stomach, the bladder, the intestines, &c. shrink, contract, and are reduced to so small a compass when com- pared to that in a state of plenitude. There is not one muscle in animal life that will admit, like those of organic, of that immense dispropor- tion between their two most distant states. It may be remarked that life, without having contractility under its immediate dependence, since the intestines, the stomach, and the bladder, will contract after death, when the cause of their distentions has been removed, will modify it, how- ever, in a very striking degree. The causes even which alter or reduce the vital powers act upon them; hence the following observation, with which those who follow the courses of dissections may have been struck with. Whenever death has been sudden, and the stomach is empty, it is very much contracted; but when, on the contrary death is the result of a long disease which has reduced the powers, the stomach, although empty, is left flabby, and is but slightly contracted.

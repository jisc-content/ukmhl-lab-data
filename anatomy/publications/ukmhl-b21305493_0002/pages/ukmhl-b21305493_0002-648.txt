SEROUS SYSTEM. 606 lungs were gorged with blood. 3dly. In a man who had become emphysematous in consequence of having been poisoned, these organs were found inflated. 4thly. Injected in the abdomen or in the peritoneum, coloured fluids were soon after found, it is said, in the adjacent lymphatics. I have repeatedly made this experiment: the fluid was soon absorbed, but not with the colour- ing matter ; so that in this substance, more con- densed subsequent to absorption, the serous sur- face and the lymphatics remained transparent as before. In general the abdomen should be selected for these kind of experiments, because almost bare over the liver, the absorbents are more easily investigated. This absorbent faculty is continued some time after death; but to insure success, the animal, if possessed of warm blood, should be kept in a bath nearly of the same temperature ; I have had frequent oppor- tunities of ascertaining this truth, and of observ- ing with Cruikshank, that what Mascagni says respecting the absorption of human bodies, fifteen, thirty, even forty-eight hours after death, was at least excessively exaggerated. 5thly. Every year I make the following experiment to demon- strate the absorbents; I macerate in water during five or six hours the heart of a bullock ; the serous membrane of that organ, which before hardly exhibited any of these organs, appears covered with them. 6thly. When the serous

SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 634 ciate such an hypothesis. What would be said of a theory in which, to explain the production of the serous fluid in the abdomen, the source from which it flows were placed in the liver, spleen, intestines, and in general in all the organs of that cavity ? Undoubtedly the answer must be, that a fluid of a similar nature could not possibly flow from parts so different in structure ; that it is much more natural to look for the only source in the membrane by which all the gastric viscera are enveloped. The application is correct, and the analogy complete in respect to the articula- ting cavities. We may then, I believe, without fear of error, conclude from all this, that the synovia does not transude into the articulating surfaces. Let us proceed to the last mode, indicated for the separation of synovia. Is the Synovia transmitted by Exhalation to the Articulating Surfaces ? The solution of the two preceding problems naturally lead to the question now proposed. In fact the following are opinions, the correctness of which I believe may be admitted : 1st. Secre- tion, exhalation, and transudation, are the only means by which a fluid differing from the blood can be conveyed to an organ. Sndly. The syno- via is not produced by secretion, nor does it

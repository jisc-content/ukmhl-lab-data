Let these powers cease to act, and instantly the contractility of the extended muscle will actually come in play, and restore the moveable part to its medium position, a po- sition in which the equilibrium is restored. This explains why, in every case in which the cerebral influence does not act upon the muscles in which they are not irritated by stimulants, the limbs are always in a medium position with respect to flexion and extension, adduction, abduction, Sic. This is the case, during sleep, with the foetus, &c. I have demonstrated elsewhere how the disposition of the bones in each articulation is accommodated to this phenomenon, how every other kind of connection between the articulating surfaces, besides that of this medium position, pre- sented a forced state, in which some ligaments are unavoidably more drawn out than others, and in which the surfaces are never in such per- fect contact as in this position. In certain fevers which exercise a deleterious influence over the vitality and texture of muscles, the horizontal position, and the extension of the limbs, do not proceed from an increase of action in the exten- sors, but from a want of energy in the flexors which cannot counterbalance the weight of the limb. Thus every analogous attitude always co- incides with signs of general weakness ; it is that of putrid fevers, &c. The section of a living muscle displays two x 2

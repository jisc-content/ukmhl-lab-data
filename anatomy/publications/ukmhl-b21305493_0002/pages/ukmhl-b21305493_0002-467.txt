OF ORGANIC LIFE. 426 crease of power, it contracts; hence the spasmo- dic vomitings continued for the few days the animal survives the experiment-â€”vomitings I have constantly ascertained in dogs, and already pointed out by Haller and Cruikshank. From this then it appears, that although the brain has great influence over the stomach, this influence is quite different from that it exercises over the voluntary muscles. I have remarked, however, that the irritation of the par vagum of one or both sides, will instantly cause the stomach to contract, as it happens with a voluntary mus- cle. On irritating its nerve to try this expe- riment, the abdomen of a living animal should be laid open, so as to present a fair view of the or- gan that is to contract, and then the irritation applied to the eighth pair of nerves in the region of the neck. In their connections with the brain, the bladder and the rectum seem to approach nearer to the voluntary muscles than the stomach and the heart. We are aware that a fall upon the sacrum, from which a commotion of the inferior part of the marrow arises, causes retention of urine; that the bladder becomes paralyzed in the same man- ner as the lower limbs, which then cease also to move : however, as that organ is powerfully as- sisted in its functions by the abdominal muscles, by the levatores ani, and by voluntary muscles, the retention may in a great measure be owing

256 fibro-cartilaginous system. culating fibro-cartilages, and in those of the grooves: from this they borrow the white hue by which they are characterized, the organic as- pect displayed by their sections in various parts, and the elasticity specially allotted to them. When undergoing ebullition, the articulating fibro-carti- lages, like those of the tendinous-grooves, become yellow, transparent, and diffuse into gelatine, though with much more difficulty than the real cartilages. In respect to the membranous fibro-cartilages of the ear, the nose, the trachea, the epiglottis, and the eye-lids, their composition seems very diffe- rent. They are not reduced to a gelatinous state by the action of boiling water, in a sensible man- ner at least ; they remain white, are but indiffe- rently softened, present quite a different aspect from that of a fibrous organ, or from the other fibro-cartilages that have undergone ebullition, and that liquify after becoming yellow and semi- transparent. The simple inspection of the ears of animals dressed for our meals, evidently proves this fact, which I have also repeatedly ascertained in my experiments. I know but few tissues in the economy that resemble this. When it has under- gone ebullition for some length of time, the kind of periosteum that covers it falls off, and the car- tilage itself splits and cracks in different places : the rings of the trachea especially, afford us in- stances of this last phenomenon.

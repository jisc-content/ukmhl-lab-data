MUCOUS SYSTEM. This system, the name of which I borrow from the fluid with which it is habitually lubricated, and which flows from small glands belonging to its structure, displays in all parts the form of a mem.' brane; it is never met with in fasciculi. In treating of the mucous organs, we shall then most gene- rally describe them under the name of mem- branes. Their study is quite a new object of re- search. Vinel was one of the first who felt the necessity of considering them in a general light in respect to diseases. I am the first, I believe, who has taken a similar view of their anatomical and physiological character. Few systems are more deserving of our attention ; upon this all the important phenomena of digestion, respira- tion, secretions, excretions, &c. depend, and it is the seat of many diseases. In a nosography in which diseases should be classed according to systems, this should occupy a space equal to several.

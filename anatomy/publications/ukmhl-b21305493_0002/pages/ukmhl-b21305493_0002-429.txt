This cause added to the preceding, appears to me to be amongst others, that which produces the sud- den transition from the apathy of the foetus, or at least from its deficiency of motions to the general agitation of all its limbs* of its abdo- men, chest, face, &c.; for instantly after birth, nearly all his muscles move with more or less energy. Let us be careful, however, not to exaggerate the influence of a cause which undoubtedly is not the only one; the motions of the diaphragm, and of the pectoral muscles, for instance, are evi- dently antecedent to the red blood reaching the brain, since their action is indispensable for the production of this red blood. These muscles be- gin to act, because the contact of air to the whole of the body, and to the mucous surfaces, stimu- lates the brain, which is the centre of all sensaÂ« tion. Influenced by this cause, the brain re-acts upon the muscles, and disposes them to contract. The contractions increase, when to this exterior and indirect excitation is added the interior and direct excitation we have just mentioned. This second state is not indispensably necessary to the foetus ; for infants are often seen to conti- nue livid, and to move perfectly, some time afte c c 2

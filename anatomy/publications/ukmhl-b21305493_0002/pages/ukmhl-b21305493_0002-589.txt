547 MUCOUS SYSTEM. membranes, wherein the exhalant and absorbant systems are alternately in regular and continual ac- tion. There are scarcely any other absorptions ex- cept those of chyle, of beverages, and of the watery parts of secreted fluids, stagnating in their reser- voirs on issuing from their respective glands, that are uninterruptedly continued ? Nothing is more variable than all the other absorptions. Under the very same influence, the glands will absorb or re- ject the venereal matter ; the internal surface of the bronchia sometimes receive, at other times reject morbid emanations. There are more in- stances of retention of urine in which this fluid is not wholly absorbed than cases wherein such absorption takes place, &c. &c. The innumer- able varieties in the vital powers of the mucous membranes—varieties produced by the difference of the exciting causes with which they come in \ contact—explain these phenomena. If these pow- ers are ever so little exalted or reduced, the ab- sorption is altered; even that which is natural, as the absorption of chyle. A purgative will con- tract and obliterate even the absorbing orifices of the intestinal tube ; as long as the irritation is continued, all fluids are expelled through the anus: after four or five hours have elapsed, the absorbents gradually re-assume their natural type, and absorption begins anew. These medicaments only expel at first the faecal matter, the subse- quent stools are nothing more than the copious N N 2

Thus, the more a bone con- tains of that substance, the more nourishing it is; those of young animals are, in this respect, the fitter for broth, and the better digested raw by peculiar animals, &c.

Besides the above mentioned substances, the bones also contain a few saline principles, such as the sulphate and carbonate of soda, &c. but in such small quantities, that it is not worth while to consider them here. On this head, I shall refer to books on chemistry, particularly to the import- ant work of Fourcroy. SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Osseous System. The ancients had ranked the bones amongst the white organs, amongst tendons, cartilages, &c.; kut it is only necessary to examine their interior,

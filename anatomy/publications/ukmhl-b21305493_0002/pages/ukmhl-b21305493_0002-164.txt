122 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. tendon of the posterior tibial, near to its insertion into the tuberosity of the os scaphoides, that of the peroneus longus on its crossing under, and the os cuboides are also supplied with sesamoid bones. Two are constantly found under the metatarso- phalangean articulation of the great toe, and under the greatest part of corresponding articulations of the other toes, some are also discovered, although they are more variable. I have also frequently found them in the phalangean articulations. In general the sesamoid bones are only to be seen in the points of flexion, in the direction that has to bear the strongest efforts. In those of extension, I know of none except the patella. These minute bones have not, like the larger, an insulated existence; they are constantly formed in a fibrous organ, either in a tendon like those of the gemelli, the peroneus, the posterior tibial, and the patella also ; or in a ligament, like all those situate anterior to the metacarpo-pha- langean, metatarso-phalangean, or phalangean articulations, which have for their bases, the large transverse fibrous bands, we have denominated anterior ligaments of these articulations. Fibro- Cartilaginous State. The two primitive bases of the sesamoid bones, require a considerable time before their rudiments are developed, and are the same in those parts

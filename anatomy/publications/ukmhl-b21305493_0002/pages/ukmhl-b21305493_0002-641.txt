SEUOUS SYSTEM. 599 texture in the least, instead of separating phos- phate of lime, and impregnating itself with it, nature had endowed it with the faculty of secret- ing fibrine and incrusting itself with it. Now the serous system seems to have no distinct nutri- tive matter, and consequently no specific tissue, it is moulded as the others, and is not penetrated with any substance that characterizes it. Nearly every where cellular, it only differs from the cellular tissue in being more condensed, its cellulae in the ordinary state being placed at greater dis- tances. That this texture is really cellular rests upon the following proofs: 1st. The structure must be similar whenever we find identity in functions and affections ; now it is evident that the uses of these membranes and of the cellular tissue, in respect to the continual absorption and exhala- tion of lymph, are perfectly the same, and that they absolutely share in common the phenomena of dropsies; with this distinction only, that in the one the fluid is poured upon the surface, in the other it is infiltrated. 2dly. By inflating the tissue beneath, their cellular structure is rendered more apparent, particularly when the air has passed readily, an experiment frequently attended with difficulty. 3dly. Maceration, in the course of time, as Haller has judiciously observed, will produce the same effect, but still more evidently. The different kinds of cysts, hydatides, &c., the

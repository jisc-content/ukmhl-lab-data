53 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. bones. Animal sensibility being but slowly and imperfectly developed by the diseases that essen- tially affect these organs, the sympathies have much less influence. These sympathies then, must essentially affect the organic sensibility and insen- sible organic contractility ; and as these two pro- perties are but very slowly developed, it follows that the different sympathies must be perfectly unconnected with the acute affections of the other organs : it is what observation evidently proves. In fact, if we only observe, that whilst the other systems readily sympathise with the acute affec- tions of another organ, this organ, as well as the cartilaginous and fibro-cartilaginous systems, &c., in almost every case remain inactive. If the stomach, the lungs, the brain, &c., be the seat of some serious and acute disease, a variety of sym- pathetic phenomena are produced in the nervous, vascular, muscular, glandular, cutaneous, and mucous systems, &c. &c.: all seem to partake of the mischief in the affected organ. Each, in pro- portion to the degree of its vital powers, displays a variety of phenomena that are nothing more than aberrations, irregular developements of these powers. In the muscular system of animal life, the animal contractility is especially increased ; hence spasms and convulsions : in the glandular, serous, cutaneous, mucous systems, &c., it is the insensible organic contractility, and organic sen- sibility, that* undergo the greatest alteration ;

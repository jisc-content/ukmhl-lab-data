426 MUSCULAR SYSTEM to the loss of power in these muscles. What in- duces me to believe it, is; 1st. The irritation of the spinal marrow, which brings in motion all the voluntary muscles of the inferior limbs and of the pelvis, has no effect upon this part. I have repeatedly ascertained this fact in guinea pigs and dogs ; 2dly. On irritating>the nerves proceeding from the foramina of the sacrum to the bladder, nerves frequently found with the utmost difficulty in an animal recently killed, on account of the blood, I have seen this muscle perfectly immoveable. All these nerves, on the contrary, having been divided, the injection of an irritating fluid will cause it to contract powerfully; Sdly. In experiments on living animals, as well as in chirurgical operations, the violence of the pain, which sometimes causes spasmodic coontractions in every muscle of animal life, will frequently cause an involuntary emission of urine. Now in this case it is not the bladder that is convulsively agitated, for if this phenomenon be manifested in an experiment upon the abdominal parieties, the flow of urine instantly ceases, because, on the one hand, the muscles of these parieties will no longer act upon the intestines and press them against the bladder, and on the other hand, the levatores ani, which contract and raise that organ, have no point of resistance against which they may compress it above. In rather copious emis- sions, the bladder is placed between two re-

And finally, aqueous fluids, poultices, fomentations, called emollients, seem least of all calculated to produce this excitement; they even rather weaken the cutaneous organic sensibility ; they act upon it as a sedative. They mitigate the kind of irritation it has produced in inflammation. It is the .same in regard to the greatest part of greasy substances; thus oil, butter, grease, &c. are in general incapable of maintaining suppuration subsequent to blister- ing. To maintain the skin in a proper degree of organic sensibility, indispensable for the purulent discharge, it is requisite that cantharides should be mixed with these substances. The skin does not seem to possess sensible or- ganic contractility. Stimulants in general have no other effect upon it, than to create that slow contraction, imperceptible to the eye, which con- stitutes insensible contractility, and is particularly effected in the small capillary tubes. There is, however, one circumstance in which this kind of contraction is observable in some degree, namely, when cold powerfully acts upon the skin, and braces it. I have already explained the me- chanism of that contraction, the seat of which is in the corium, and which, as well as several other motions I have occasionally described, pre- sent a medium between the two kinds of organic contractilities.

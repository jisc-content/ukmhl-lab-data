613 SEROUS SYSTEM, as are liable to habitual and alternate dilatation and contraction ; as round the stomach, the intes- tines, the uterus and the bladder ; very obvious in the first state, they are hardly observable in the second. 2dly. The great size of the serous cavities accords with the displacements of which their membranes are susceptible. Thus, when the liver is considerably increased its serous membrane also partly increases at the ex pence of that of the dia- phragm, which by being drawn ou tis separated, and directly applied over the obstructed viscus. In an aneurism of the heart, I have seen the peri- cardium, which could not allow of sufficient disten- sion, partly loosened from the portion of large vessels it covered. 3dly and finally. The tissue of these membranes is really distended in every direction, but this is in general the least striking cause of the increase of their cavities; it is only when these are rather considerable that they exer- cise over them a powerful influence ; in ordinary cases the two first causes are generally sufficient. I shall state one important observation respect- ing the change of position displayed during the motions of their respective organs; it is that these displacements are attended with the most acute pain ; when these membranes are inflamed, when the intestines, in a state of dilatation, separate the two diseased sheets of the mesentery, to pass be- tween, when the stomach forces itself between those of the omentum, whenever the peritoneum

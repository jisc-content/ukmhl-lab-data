GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 712 or modification in its vital powers, may then become the source of a multiplicity of different fluids : I even believe this may be extended so far, that the kidneys assuming a sensibility ana- logous to that of the liver, might separate pure bile ; and why should not this organ secrete it in the same manner as it separates other fluids so very distinct from its own ? In health each gland is possessed of rather an uniform mode of sensibility, a mode admitting of hardly any change: thus then all secreted fluids remain almost constantly the same in aspect, composition, and nature. But in diseases, a thousand causes incessantly contribute to change this mode. The hysteric fit acts upon the kidneys, and instantly repels all colouring principles from the urine, which flows limpid; when the fit is over, the organ re-assumes its peculiar sensibility, and the urine is restored to its natural state. The epileptic fit extends its influence to the sensibility of the salivary glands: instantly a thick, abun- dant,^ and frothy saliva, very different from what in its natural state flows from the mouth, but as soon as the fit has subsided, the fluid is restored to its usual state. Let me be allowed a si- mile. Glands are in diseases, what the atmosphere is during the equinox : at these epochs, the winds varying and changing incessantly, frequently cause a rapid succession pi rain, hail, snow, See.;

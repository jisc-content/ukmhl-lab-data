298 MUSCULAR SYSTEM, aware that varices are very seldom met with in the veins of muscles. These veins are of two kinds; some attend the arteries, and follow the same course; the others wind superficially over the surface of the organs, unattended with corre- sponding arteries. The muscles contain absorbants and exhalants. The first can be traced, though not without diffi- culty ; the second are inscrutable. Nerves. Almost all the nerves of the muscles of animal life proceed from the brain : the ganglions supply them with a few only, whenever this is the case, as in the neck, the pelvis, &c^ Resides the filaments proceeding from these nervous centres, 43o-rvi-e(%l filaments are constantly met with ; were it not for this, such organs would belong to the involuntary muscles. No organs whatever, in proportion to their size, are provided with more nerves than the muscles. In the extensors they do not appear to be quite so numerous as in the flexors: but the difference is very immaterial. It is true, that all the large nervous trunks are found in the direction of flexion ; that in that of exten- sion, branches and ramusculse only are to be met with, as is seen in the posterior part of the arm, of the fore-arm, of the spine, &c. This remark is also applicable to the existence of the vessels.

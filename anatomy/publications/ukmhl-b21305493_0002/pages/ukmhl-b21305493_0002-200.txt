CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 158 ARTICLE III. Properties of the Cartilaginous System. SECTION i. Physical Properties. * Elasticity is a property generally extended to every organic and inorganic body. Amongst the former, it appears that vegetables are endowed with that property in a greater number of their organs than animals. In the latter, nearly all the parts are soft, a few only admitting of re-action after having been bent or compressed. Amongst these parts, cartilages in man hold the first rank ; their elasticity is very conspicuous, particularly in the adult, in whom their consistence holds the medium between the softness that characterizes them in infancy, and their rigidity in old age. These two last properties, in fact, are not at all favourable to elasticity. If the blade of a scalpel be thrust into a carti- lage, the two edges of the division will re-act upon it and repel the offensive instrument. Pressed against a resisting form, the cartilaginous end of a long bone becomes flattened, and re- assumes its primitive shape as soon as the cause of compression is removed. In the operation of bronchotomy, the thyroid cartilage divided in its longitudinal direction, abruptly brings to- gether its divided surfaces. The section of the

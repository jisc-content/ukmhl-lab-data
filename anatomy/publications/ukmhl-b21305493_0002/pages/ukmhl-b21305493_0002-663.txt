SEROUS SYSTEM. 621 serous fluids, border then upon those of synovia. I cannot account for this difference. Besides this fluid does not appear proportionally so abundant as that of the cellular fluids, with which, however, it bears so much analogy; this is probably owing to the internal motions being less numerous; considering the inactive state of the major part of the organic muscles, less fluid is required to lubricate the surfaces. The increase of the serous system is always in proportion to that of the organs it is intended to receive. The tunica arachnoides is proportionally much wider in youth than in the adult: similar to the brain, it then appears to be the seat of a more active nutrition: thus is it more liable to diseases. The increase of exhalation is more common in this than in any other serous bag: hence, hydro- cephalus. At birth, when the internal motions suddenly become excessively multiplied, on account of respiration, digestion and secretion, the serous surfaces I conceive become the seat of more active exhalation. Besides, as they are permeated with but very little blood, the sudden production of the red blood, and its approach through the arterial system where it succeeds to the dark blood, produces less changes in them than in the mucous surfaces and muscular system. The serous membranes grow in the same man- Â® ner as all the other organs ; thin fora long time.

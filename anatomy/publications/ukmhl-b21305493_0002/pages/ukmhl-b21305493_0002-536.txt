494 MUCOUS SYSTEM. tissue the mucous surface derives its force. On this the organ it invests is moulded ; it both fixes and maintains its form, as the following experi- ment proves. If we strip from any part of the intestines a little of this as well as of the serous and muscular layers, and inflate it after having tied the lower end, the air will produce a hernia in this part of the mucous membrane. If on the other hand we remove a small point of the mucous and submucous membranes, the same effect is pro- duced by inflation, with the serous and muscular coats, as in the preceding case with respect to the mucous coat. To this submucous cellular layer, the organ is then indebted for the resistance it opposes to the substances it contains, and the same remark applies also to the stomach, the bladder, the oesophagus, &c. SECTION III. Free Surface of the Mucous Membranes. In the free surfaces of the mucous membranes that are habitually lubricated by the fluid from which they borrow their name, three kinds of pleats or folds are observed. 1st. Those belonging to the structure of all the layers of these membranes, are constantly met with, whatever may be their state of dilatation or contraction : such are those of the pylorus and

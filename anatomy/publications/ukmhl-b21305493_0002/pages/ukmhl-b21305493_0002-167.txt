125 OSSEOUS SYSTEM, the centre of motion, facilitate their glidings over the bones, protect their articulations, and even concur in the motions. All those formed in the anterior metacarpo and metatarso-phalangean, even those of the phalangean articulations, also assist in the motions of these articulations. A por- tion of the synovia is spread over their surface, that remains slightly cartilaginous, and cor- responds to them. The formation of the sesamoid bones is not, as has been asserted, a mechanical effect of the pressure of the tendons and ligaments against the bones, but a result of the laws of ossification. Why, ad- mitting the first supposition, should not every articulation of the hand and foot, besides those above-mentioned, and exposed to nearly the same motions, be equally provided with these organs ?

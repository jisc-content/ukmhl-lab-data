647 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. neum, the pleura, Ac. tfcc., are imbedded. It is there the blood vessels divide ad infinitum, before they reach the membrane, where their ramusculee successively decreasing, finally terminate in the exhalents. If these bundles are sometimes dis- tinct from the cellular tissue by a remarkable redness, it is because the vessels are more concen- trated, and lay nearer to each other; for instance, in the articulation of the hip, where the synovial membrane corresponds with cellular tissue in the notch of the cotyloidal cavity only, nature has concentrated nearly every arterial ramification, by which it is supplied with synovia: hence the red hue of the cellular mass of that part. In the knee, on the contrary, where the external surface of the synovial bag is liberally supplied with cel- lular tissue, the numerous vessels impart to this tissue the same hue as that of the external surface of the serous membranes, &c. This redness of a few pretended synovial glands, the only character attributed to them, is only accidental then, and no more proves their glandular nature, than in the pia-mater, where it proceeds from the same cause. Although perfectly analogous with the serous surfaces, the synovial membranes must, however, present some difference in tissue, since the fluid they exhale is rather different. In fact, in examin- • • • mg it mthe femorO'tibial articulation, where con- siderable threads may be obtained, it is found denser and tighter than the serous membranes*

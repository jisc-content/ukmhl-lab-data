428 MIJSLUL.lIt SYSTEM impulse given to the urine. To emit this fluid then, requires that the contraction of the adjacent voluntary muscles be superadded to that of the bladder ; but the slightest effort of these muscles would be sufficient to overcome the resistance of the urethra. If the quantity of urine be con- siderable, and by having remained there some time it has acquired that colour which indicates the concentration of its principles, then its irrita- tion upon the organ acts forcibly upon the sensi- ble organic contractility, the bladder contracts in spite of the animal, and the urine is ejected. In the rectum, where the faeces have not a long tube to traverse, but merely a single aperture, this aper- ture is provided with a sphincter, which is want- ing in the urethra. This sphincter, habitually con- tracted, requires to be dilated, by the impulse of the faeces: for as they have been retained but a short time onlv in the rectum, and in a small quantity only, the sensible organic contractility is not sufficiently excited to expel them, the ac- tion of the adjacent voluntary muscles is also re- quired. If this action is not commanded by the influence of the brain, the faeces remain in the in- testine ; hence we can retain them for a considera- ble time. But if their quantity be increased, or by being allowed to remain they acquire some degree of acrimony, and become irritating, then sensible organic contractility being powerfully excited, the gut is emptied in spite of the will. If the

DERMOID A L SYSTEM. 841 a greater or less quantity of fluids ? why do they at certain times open a passage to substances, which on other occasions they will not admit ? It is be- cause their organic powers have undergone other modifications. These powers are very evidently reduced by diseases; they are left in a languid, a prostrate state. Blistering then is of no use ; or- ganic sensibility will no longer answer the applica- tion of stimulants. It is even a very striking phe- nomenon in irregular fevers, and an additional proof how completely independent of the cerebral nerves are all the phenomena of cutaneous exhala- tion and capillary circulation, &c. In effect, whilst during the fit the brain is in the highest degree of excitement, that by this excitation the volun- tary muscles are violently convulsed, that the whole animal life seems to have doubled its energy before it is extinct, the organic is already partly exhausted : the functions of that portion of the skin belonging to this life have already ceased. The degree of intensity of the stimulating agents of organic sensibility varies in an astonish- ing degree. 1st. The most powerful are fire, can- tharides, alkalies, acids sufficiently diluted in water, so as to act only upon the vital powers without contracting the tissue of the skin, the juices of a variety of plants of a sour nature, even certain fluids formed in the body, as those of cancers, &c. All these stimulants redden the skin on being ap- plied to it. 2dly. The greater part of these sti-

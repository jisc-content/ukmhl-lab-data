472 MUSCULAR SYSTEM extracted from any living animals; instantly place the fingers of one hand in the auricles or ventricles of one, and grasp with the other the exterior of the second, and it will be found that the effort of the latter on dilating, is quite as powerful as that of the other in contracting. This fact, which had already been observed by Pechlin, is so much the more remarkable, as the effort of dilatation frequently exceeds that of contraction. I have even observed in repeating that experi- ment, that howTever much the organ is com- pressed, it cannot be prevented from dilating ; 4thly. The alternate extension and contraction from which the vermicular motion of the intes- tines arises, is observed in hunger, on opening the abdomen of an animal; 5thly. The hardness of the muscular tissue, is as evident when the or- gan is dilated as when it is empty ; 6thly. I have frequently observed that the instant I irritated the heart with the point of the knife, dilatation was the first result, and contraction was only com secutive. In experiments it generally happens that contraction is first observed, but there is no doubt that when the muscle is at rest it is often dilated previously. It seems then highly probable that the dilatation of organic muscles depends as much upon vitality as their contraction; that these two states are unavoidably connected ; that their union forms the muscular motion, of which contraction is only a part. Who can say that

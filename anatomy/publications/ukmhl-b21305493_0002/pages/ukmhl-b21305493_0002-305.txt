X have obsei ved, that after the ears of a dog have been divided by a longitudinal section, if the edges of the section be brought and kept in contact by one or two stitches, the two parts of the skin will in a few days be perfectly re-united; but the re-union of the cartilage under this will require a much longer time to be effected, as may be ascertained by ex- amining the parts subsequent to the re-union of the integuments. I presume the very same thing would happen in the operation of tracheotomy practised in former days, in which the soft parts, undergoing first cicatrization, keep in contact the cartilaginous semi-rings, which ultimately became agglutinated. To this obscurity of vital properties in the fibre-cartilages, and to their want of energy, must undcubtedlv also be attributed the scarcity of * * diseases that affect these organs. X know of few organic systems in the animal economy, more sel- dom affected than that of the fibro-cartilages of the nose, of the ear, trachea, &c. They are scarcely susceptible of gangrene; for whilst the surround- ing parts are already quite black, they are hardly changed. The nature of the fluid they emit in suppuration is not yet known, and suppuration itself, from a want of vital activity, is very rare in these organs.

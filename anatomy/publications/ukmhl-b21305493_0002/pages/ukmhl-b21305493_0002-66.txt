24 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. head of the femur, twenty on the body of a dorsal vertebrae, fifty on the os calcis, &c. This number is in general in proportion to the quan- tity of cancelli contained in the bone. This ex- plains why so few are met with in the skull, why they are more multiplied in the bones of the pel- vis, particularly in those parts where this tissue is abundant, as in the os ischium, in the iliac part of the circumference of that bone, &c : on pouring mercury in the spongy tissue, this fluid is found streaming through these holes, and thus displays their communications. Where these apertures exist they are irregularly distributed: none are found on the body of long bones, because they contain no cancelli, or scarcely any. The third species that gives admission to the nutritive organs, is a multiplicity of small pores, evidently perceptible to the eye, through which minute vessels that are lost in this tissue penetrate ; an evident proof they do not reach the cancelli, is, that in the preceding experiment the mer- cury never finds in them an outward issue : their number is past description, in the infant it is very great, gradually as in old age the bones be- come overloaded with the calcareous substance, the apertures are obliterated, and the small ves- sels they contain converted into small ligaments, are no longer concerned with the nutrition of bones that gradually decay, and would end by being completely annihilated, producing necrosis

184 FIBROUS SYSTEM. complete the barbarous deed. Weights suspend- ed to a tendon, will never part them, except when they are very enormous: thus the best cordage that could be used in manufactories, would be those twisted with animal fibres, if these organs were not robbed of their softness and flexibility by desiccation; if humidity did not vitiate them, &c. ; 5thly, an aponeurosis cannot be lacerated without the greatest force, especially those which are rather thick, as the fascia-lata, the tunica albuginea, the dura-mater, &e. This resistance, however, is occasionally over- powered in the living subject, and surgical prac- tice sometimes affords instances, in which the tendons of the soleus, of the plantaris, of the ex- tensors of the thigh, &c. But how does it hap- pen, that the tissue of a softer muscle never gives way, while that of a much denser tendon is rup- tured ? It proceeds from the fleshy fibres being constantly in such cases in a state of contraction ; consequently far from being distended, as the tendinous fibres, which then are in a passive state as it were, their divers parts exert their powers to draw nearer to each other ; and, in fact, they succeed, which gives to the muscle a density, and hardness equal, and even in some cases, much su- perior to those of their tendons ; as may be ob- served by placing the hand over a contracted muscle. As a further proof, these kind of rup- tures proceed from the cause I have pointed out,

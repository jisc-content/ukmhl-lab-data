OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 29 that direction which the fibres will subsequently assume. Thus are these fibres very apparent in the early age, particularly in the bones of the skull. In proportion as the calcareous phosphate successively accumulated in the cartilaginous pa- renchyma predominates, every thing in the com- pact tissue seems confounded in one homogeneous mass. But, even then, various circumstances seem to point to the direction of the primitive fibres : 1st. Whenever by the means of acids the bone has been deprived of its calcareous substance, the cartilaginous parts retain, as a kind of mould, the form of the substances by which it was filled, and display fibres, whose directions are the same as those described in the three species of bones. Thus, if the laceration of the cartilaginous la- * mellee be then attempted, they are more readily separated in this direction; 2d. The clefts that occur in bones long exposed to the air generally follow the natural direction of the fibrf; 3d. The calcination of bones displays nearly the same phenomenon. The direction of fibres in the compact tissue is completely changed in the apophysis, where it does not follow that of the principal bone; in those which in form partake of the character of long bones, as in the styloid process, these fibres are longitudinal; they assume every direction in those, which like the mastoid, the different species

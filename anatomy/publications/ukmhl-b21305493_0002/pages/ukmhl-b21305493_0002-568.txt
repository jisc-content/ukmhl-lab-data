626 MUCOUS SYSTEM. rupted secretions, an essential part in the animal economy. They should be considered as forming one of those grand emunctories through which the residue of the nutriment is incessantly expelled, and consequently as one of the principal agents of the habitual decomposition that rids living bodies of the particles which, after having con- curred for a limited time, to the composition of the solids, have subsequently become hete- rogeneous to them. Let us remark that all mucous fluids are not admitted into the circula- tion, but are expelled ; that of the bladder, of the ureters, and urethra, with the urine; that of the vesiculse seminales and vas deferens, with the semen ; that of the fossae nasales in the act of blowing the nose; that of the mouth, partly by evaporation, partly through the anus with the faeces ; that of the bronchia with the pulmonary exhalationâ€”chiefly effected, as I shall state, by the solution of this mucous fluid in the air that is inspired ; in those of the oesophagus, stomach, in- testines, gall bladder, &c. with the excrements of which they frequently form, in the natural state, a part nearly as considerable as those of the re- sidue of the food, which excrements are even ex- clusively composed of these fluids; in certain bloody fluxes ; in some fevers, wherein the quan- tity of matter expelled is evidently dispropor- tionate with that taken in, &c. In this respect we may observe that there is always some defect

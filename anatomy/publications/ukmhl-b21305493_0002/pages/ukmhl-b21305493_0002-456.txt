414 MUSCULAR SYSTEM the process of nutrition is preeternaturally in- creased. To empty the heart of the contained blood would be useless ; it would not contract, nor return to its original dimensions in the same manner as the inflated intestine will, on being punctured to let out the air. In the womb there are two causes of disten- tion; 1st. The sinuses largely developed, and containing a quantity of blood; 2dly. An addi- tion of substance, a real temporary increase of the fibres of the organ, which remain as thick, and even more so, than in the natural state. At the moment of delivery the sinuses are lessened in size from the contraction of the fibres : hence the spontaneous contraction of the organ. But as on one part the substances superadded to the febres can be removed by the decomposition which takes place in the nutritive process, and on the other part, this function is slowly affected, after the womb has undergone the sudden con- traction, owing to the depression of the sinuses, it is only gradually, and with time that it re-as- sumes its natural state. The womb filled with the foetus, and the heart affected with aneu- rism, are not in a state of distention: in such cases these organs actually become the focus of more active nutrition ; they grow accidentally in the same manner as they grew naturally with the other organs, except that they become compara- tively monstrous. After delivery the womb de-

282 MUSCULAR SYSTEM together, and it becomes thinner, harder, and brittle. When after a few days, even after fifteen or thirty, subsequent to desiccation, it is again immersed in water, it will re-assume its primi- tive form and softness, and a lighter hue. The water that has been employed has a more or less offensive smell, similar to that proceeding from the fluid employed in maceration ; 2dly. If ex- posed in too considerable a mass to the contact of air, the muscular tissue does not become dry, it putrefies. Thus in making dried anatomical pre- parations, great care is taken to reduce the thick- ness of the fleshy layers, or to dispose them in such a manner as will allow the air to penetrate in every direction. If the air be damp, or if the evaporation has not been sufficiently rapid, pu- trefaction is the necessary result. In putrefying, the muscles acquire a green aspect, a livid hue, and exhale a foetid smell. Under similar cir- cumstances they putrefy much quicker than the fibrous, the cartilaginous, and fibro-cartila- ginous substances. The smell is also very dif- ferent from that exhaled from these systems: sometimes a phosphoric spark is produced. A thick putrelage, in which there is no semblance of fibre, is formed when the progress of putre- faction is far advanced ; by degrees this putre- lage is partly evaporated, and there remains a dark brown residue, which on drying becomes hard and brittle, nearly the same as the muscle

OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 114 jaw. At the age of four years, four and a half, and sometimes at five, and even six, constantly, however, at an uncertain period, two other grinders, first below, then above, are produced, they complete the number of twenty-four, of which the first dentition is composed. In fact, all these teeth afterwards fall out and are re- placed by new ones. The mechanism of this first dentition is as fol- lows :â€”The ossification constantly advancing to- wards the root, the whole tooth can no longer be contained within the alveolus, and forces its way through the alveolar part of the membrane, the mucous membrane of the mouth, and an inter- posed pulpous tissue that separates them ; this is the . more easily effected, because this threefold layer becomes gradually thinner as we draw nearer to the time when they appear. Does this phenome- non proceed only from the mechanical pressure of the tooth ? I think there must be another cause ; for here we should observe, they are hardly ele- vated before they are perforated ; whilst, by a polypus, or other tumours that frequently form under the membrane of the gums, it is much more extended ; but still in these cases it is not lacerated but lifted up. The mechanism of the cutting of the gums has not been better elucidated, than the principle of the fatal accidents that so fre- quently attend this event.

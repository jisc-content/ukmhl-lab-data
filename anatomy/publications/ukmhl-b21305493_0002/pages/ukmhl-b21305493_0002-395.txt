353 OF ANIMAL LIFE. observed without the organ which is the source of the sympathy being considerably affected, and the focus of animal sensibility. On the contrary, the greatest number of sym- pathies which display in a part insensible or sen- sible organic contractility to a considerable de- gree, are not characterized by those excruciating pains in the affected organ from which the ex- citement emanates; for instance, the sympathetic perspirations and secretions, the intestinal and gastric contractions, are seldom produced by af- fections bearing the character of those from which the sympathies of animal contractility arise. The brain is always first affected in the latter species of sympathies, in which the muscles are, as it were, in a passive state, and wherein they merely obey the impulse they have received. The affected organ first acts upon the brain, which subsequently re-acts upon the muscles. Authors have viewed sympathies in too vague a manner. Some have admitted, whilst others have rejected the interposition of the brain; some have not decided. All would have agreed, if instead of attempting to resolve the question in a general manner, they had viewed sympa- thies in the same manner as the vital powers, from which they are only aberrations or irregular developements; they would have found that in animal sympathies of contractility, the cerebral influence was essentially requisite, for no con- VOL.

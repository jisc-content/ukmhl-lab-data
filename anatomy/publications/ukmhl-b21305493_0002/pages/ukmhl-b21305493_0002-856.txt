I was anxious to ascertain during summer, when the transpiration is abundant, and consequently when every heterogeneous principle transudes through the skin, the state of perspired matter. To collect this humour, which is exhaled by in- sensible evaporations, I dipped an empty bottle, perfectly cleaned and dried, in a pail filled with ice and muriate of soda, and breathed into it for a considerable time ; taking care not to drop the least particle of saliva. The parietes cooled by the exterior ice, condensed in small icicles, the vapour of my breath on the internal surface of the vessel. When I had collected a sufficient quantity, I immersed the bottle in warm water, by which the icicles wTere melted, and the residue of my respiration, previously a vapour, condensed into a liquid. In this experiment, two things parti- cularly struck me, namely : 1st. The very small quantity of fluid I had obtained, although I had breathed for the space of an hour, and then made two men do the same also an hour each ; 2dly. That the generality of re-agents had no effect whatever upon this fluid. Nitric, sulphuric, and muriatic acids, the lapis infernalis and alcohol, on being mixed with it produced no particular eflect.

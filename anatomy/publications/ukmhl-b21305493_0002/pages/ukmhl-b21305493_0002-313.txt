Every long muscle generally considered, is thicker in its middle than at its ends ; a form ow- ing to the mode in which the fleshy fibres are at- tached, which arising above and terminating below successively over each other, are so much the less numerous as they are viewed nearer to each ex- tremity, whilst in the middle they are every one of them in juxta-position ; the rectus anterior, the supinator longus, the external radials, &c. evi- dently display this mode of conformation. There is another peculiar species of long mus- cles, which claim not the slightest analogy with the muscles of the limbs, except in outward ap- pearance. These are extended anterior, and parti- cularly posterior to the spine. Although apparently single at first glance, they are composed of as many distinct skains as there are vertebrae. The transverso spinalis dorsi, the longus colli, the sacro- lumbalis, &c. actually display a lengthened skain, as the sartorius, the rectus anterior of the thigh, <&c.; but the structure of this has nothing in common with that of these muscles ; they are a continuation of minute skains, distinct both in their origins and terminations, and which seem a single muscle only, because they are placed to- gether.

The Action of Acids, Alkalies, and other Substances. The sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids, act upon the skin when put in contact with it, as upon all other animal substances; I have re- marked, however, their action is much slower in its progress, particularly on the surface covered with the epidermis, even although this membrane had been previously removed. The first of these agents will easily reduce it into a blackish pulp, the others even, if highly concentrated, require more time to bring it to that state ; oxygenated muriatic acids have very little power over it. Several authors have stated in their books, that the application of caustic to the corpse will pro- duce the very same phenomena as in the living subject. I have placed several fragments of this substance in a piece of skin; I inclosed it with a knot, so as to keep them in permanent contact with the epidermis; after a space of twenty-four hours* I found these fragments dissolved by the humi- dity they had absorbed into a yellowish red pulp. Shrunk and contracted, the tissue had not been perforated, nor even did its exterior surface ap-

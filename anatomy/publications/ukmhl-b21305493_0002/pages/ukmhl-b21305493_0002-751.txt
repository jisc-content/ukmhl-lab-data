709 GLANDULAR SYSTEM, wherein certain agents have not the power to exercise it, whilst in others it is fully developed. We are fully sensible that the various morbid al- terations obviously display it in glands. The pain attending inflammation of these organs bears a peculiar character; in most cases it is obtuse. That acute sensation which characterizes cellular inflammation, or that burning and sharp pain so frequent in the skin, &c.&c., is never experienced. Properties of Organic Life. Amongst these properties, sensible contractility is wanting in the glandular system ; but the other two are developed in the highest degree. They are in an uninterrupted state of activity. Secre- tion, excretion, and nutrition, incessantly bring them into play. It is by its organic sensibility the gland selects from the mass of the blood the materials proper for its secretion. It is, by its in- sensible contractility, or by its tonic powers, that this organ contracts and rises, if I may be allowed the expression, to expel from within these mat- ters heterogeneous to this secretion. The first exists in a trifling degree in each gland : in the tongue and the nostrils, which allow proper food only I to enter the stomach, animal sensibility is very great; the former effect in an insensible manner what the glottis so evidently effects, by convul- | sively resisting the entrance of any foreign body.

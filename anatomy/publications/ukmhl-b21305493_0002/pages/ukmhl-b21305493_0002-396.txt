354 MUSCULAR SYSTEM traotility of this kind can be conceived, without the twofold influence of the brain and nerves upon the muscles; that, on the contrary, in the organic sympathies of contractility* the brain is not concerned, the affected organ acting directly upon that which sympathetically contracts, and without any intermedium. Whenever the heart, the stomach, the intestines, &c. move ; whenever the parotid gland, and the others increase their action by the sympathetic influence of a diseased organ, most undoubtedly this organ does not first act upon the brain, for in this case it would be requisite for this organ to re-act upon those which contract. Now this influence could only be con- veyed through the nerves, since, by the nerves only, the brain is connected with them; but every experiment, every fact, concurs to prove that the brain has not, through this medium, the least influence upon the organs of involuntary mo- tion, the action of which is not secondary. In this respect the sympathetic motions are similar to the natural ones ; sensible and insensible con- tractilities are constantly increased by a stimulant directly applied to the organ, whilst animal con- tractility never acts but by cerebral influence, which itself -requires either a sympathetic or a direct cause to act upon the muscles. Next to animal contractility, sensibility of the same nature is in the muscular system of animal life, that which is the most frequently and sympa-

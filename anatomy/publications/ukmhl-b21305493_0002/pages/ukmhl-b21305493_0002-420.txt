378 MUSCULAR SYSTEM fact, in these ordinary motions, the point that is moved is always the most moveable, that which remains motionless is less so ; for instance, much more exertion is required from the flexors to bend the arm over the fore-arm, than to reflect the phalanges over this, and this over the arm. Supposing their two points of attachment to be moveable, the gastrocnemii would act more effec- tually upon the foot than upon the femur, &c. In the limbs the superior point is constantly more moveable than the inferior : now the other being fixed, it is this wThich generally moves, for as by its position it offers more resistance, less exertion is required from the muscular powers to retain it. It is only in rather violent motions that the pre- liminary contraction of the muscles intended to fix one of the points of attachment is very painful. Such is the case in the chest, when the trapezius, the serratus major, or the pectoralis major con- tract powerfully: then the other muscles of that cavity strongly contract to dilate it, and thus af- ford to these muscles which move the shoulder, in the carrying burdens and other similar exer- tions, firmer and wider insertions. The dia- phragm also contracts ; hence, ruptures produced by counter strokes, in such motions, which seem at first glance not to bear the slightest analogy with the abdominal cavity. Whenever the body is in an horizontal position, and the head is up,

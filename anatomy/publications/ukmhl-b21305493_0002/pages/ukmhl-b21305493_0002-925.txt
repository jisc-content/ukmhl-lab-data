In erysi- elas, phlegmon, boils, and other similar tumours is necessarily raised ; but this is not produced by the interposition of any fluid. None could be supplied by the exhalents, since they are over-run with blood; on rising, the membrane is dry. 2dly. The epidermis is also elevated by various cutaneous eruptions unattended with inflamma- tion, as in porrigo. In these cases it most com- monly drops a kind of dry exfoliation; hence undoubtedly originated an opinion with certain authors who have ascribed a scaly structure to this membrane, an opinion, unsupported by any experiment or observation whatever taken from the natural state of the epidermis. This exfoliation merely proceeds from the very same cause by which the vesicles are formed upon the skin soon after this organ has been im- mersed in boiling water, namely, from the stronger adhesion of the exhalents that resort to the pores of the epidermis. It may be observed that those scales, in fact, which do not belong to the nature of the membrane, but merely to the mode in which it is raised, are never met with, except in the interstices by which the pores are sepa- rated ; for instance, when an eruption has formed on the chin, the epidermis is not detached at the pores, but only in their interstices, but as these distances are of course remarkably small, the ex- foliation must be so, it forms a kind of dust as it 3 Ij 2

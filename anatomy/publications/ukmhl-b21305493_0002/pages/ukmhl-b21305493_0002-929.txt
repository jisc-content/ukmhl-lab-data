887 EPIDERMOID A L SYSTEM. subjacent rete mucosum to appear, but partly con- ceals this hue in these parts. I have observed, however, by maceration, that the lighter hue of the palm and sole in these depends, in this species, upon the rete mucosum being actually less co- loured. It may be supposed that in this region, wherein the capillary net seems less abundant, every thing that relates to animal sensibility, all the phenomena which proceed from organic sen- sibility, are much less active. After having examined in this view the hand and foot of a black subject, I have been led to try some experiments on the colour of the rete mu- cosum which will be the subject of a short digres- sion. 1st. By immersing in boiling water any portion of the dermis, its dark shade becomes almost instantly deeper, which is probably owing to the fibres being drawn nearer together by the contraction which concentrates the colouring par- ticles. This phenomenon is very remarkable on comparing the part immersed with one belonging to the very same region that was not. 2dly. If maceration be continued a month or two, the epidermis may sometimes be removed inde- pendent of the rete mucosum, the seat of colour; at other times the whole is removed together. 3dly. No visible effect will be produced by being left in cold water for a day or two. 4thly. The deep black hue suddenly produced by boil-

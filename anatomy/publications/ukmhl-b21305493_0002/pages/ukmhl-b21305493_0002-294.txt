The fibro-cartilaginous system is composed of different organs, which anatomists have sometimes classed with the cartilages, at other times with the ligaments, because, in fact, they partake of the nature of both. I have given it a middle state between the two preceding, the knowledge of which will facilitate the investigation of this. ARTICLE I. Forms of the Fibro-Cartilaginous System. The fibro-cartilaginous organs may be divided into three classes, The first includes those that compose the ears, the nostrils, the trachea, the eyelids, &c.; they are very thii^ membranes as it were, sometimes disposed in an uniform manner, sometimes reflected over themselves in various ways.

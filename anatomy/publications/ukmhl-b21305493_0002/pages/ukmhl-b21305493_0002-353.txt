OF ANIMAL LIFE. 311 that in various chronic affections of the chest, and of the abdomen, attended with long conti- nued distention of this muscle, physicians should pay more attention to this cause of difficulty in the act of respiration, when the principle for dis- tention has been removed, as subsequent to the evacuation of the fluid in dropsical subjects, &c. In muscles, the extent of the contractility of the tissue is proportionate with the length of the fibres. This explains why, in amputations, the superficial layer retracts more than the deep one ; why, during sleep, the phenomena of contracti- lity of tissue are very apparent in the limbs that are provided with very long muscles; why, in the antagonist muscles, nature has in general op- posed to each other muscles of corresponding power; why, consequently, a muscle with long fibres is seldom opposed to one formed of short ones, and vice versa. The flexors, the extensors, of the arm, of the fore-arm, of the thigh, of the leg, are nearly all of the same length ; those which rotate the humerus inwardly, and those which move it in the contrary direction, the former arising from the infra-spinal cavity, the latter from the inner surface of the scapula, re- semble each other in this respect. The proportion between the antagonist muscles is still more re- markable in the facb, wherein the same muscles most commonly act in quite opposite ways to each other, on each side of the medium line.

In a word, I was almost induced to believe it was nothing but water. I confess, however, that this experiment should be repeated with care. The small quantity of fluid obtained led me to think that the form of the vessel Was not suita- ble, as it did not present a sufficient surface, and that the vapour of the lungs was not sufficiently expanded. I therefore took the spiral cylinder of a small alembic ; I surrounded it with ice, caused a man to respire through it, and I obtained, in fact, rather more fluid, but infinitely less than than what I expected, considering the immense quantity of vapour observed to escape in winter from the mouth. In the space of an hour I could obtain but two ounces of fluid, which I have comparatively weighed with water, and which I found rather heavier than the latter; a certain proof that a few principles I am unacquainted with were blended with the aqueous part. I am convinced that in winter I could obtain a much greater quantity of condensed vapour. This is proved by the breathing of animals, as I have just stated. I am also convinced that, like urine, the humour of respiration is then loaded with principles which during summer

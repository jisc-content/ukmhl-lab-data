OF ORGANIC LIFE. '411 ft and that of the stomach, by the food, by the gases emitted in these organs, by the fluids they may contain, that of the bladder by urine, by the fluids injected, &c. are essentially derived from this extensibility. This property is herein essentially characterized by two remarkable properties ; 1st. By the rapi- dity with which it can be brought into play; 2dly. By the very considerable extent it admits of. The stomach and the intestines pass in a mo- ment from a complete state of vacuity to a very considerable extension. Artificially distended, the bladder will admit of being distended to three or four times its usual size. Sometimes, however, it will resist, but this does not prove a want of ex- tensibility ; it proceeds from its being irritated by the fluid which causes it to contract; organic contractility in exercise prevents extension, as it sometimes cannot be brought to act by the irri- tation directed upon a muscle laid bare in a living animal, because the animal * contractility being fully excited in this muscle forms an obstacle to it. The muscles of animal life will never admit of such rapid extension, either because they are crossed by numerous aponeuroses, which dilate but slowly, or because their layers of fibres are too thick, two circumstances foreign to the mus- cles of organic life; hence a remarkable pheno- menon I have instanced in every case of tympa- nites.

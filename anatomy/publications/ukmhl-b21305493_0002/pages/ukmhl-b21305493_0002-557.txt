The following is an experiment I have made use of to demonstrate the influence of the papillae upon the sensibility of the cutis : it succeeds also on the mucous membranes. Let the epidermis in a part be removed, and the pa- pillae be excited with a sharp stylet; the animal will flutter, cry, and express the utmost pain ; then let a similar instrument be introduced into the sub- cutaneous cellular tissue, through a smaller open- ing in the skin, and the internal surface of the corion be irritated; the animal remains quiet, and gives no signs of pain, unless some nervous filaments have accidentally been injured by the instrument. From this it is evident, that the sensibility of the skin resides in its external sur- face ; that the nerves cross the corion without contributing to its texture, and that they only expand over the papillse : it is the very same thing in respect to the mucous surfaces. Let it be re- marked, that this circumstance perfectly coincides with the functions of each of these surfaces, which receive through their free part the impressions of external bodies, which their under surface has no connection with. The papillaÂ© display innumerable varieties. Upon the tongue, in the intestines, the stomach, and in the gall bladder, they are remarkable for their length. Less so in the oesophagus, in the large in- testines, in the bladder, and in every excretory or- gan ; indeed, in the latter, and particularly in the L I, 2

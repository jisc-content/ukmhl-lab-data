593 SEROUS SYSTEM. testis in general is left uninjured amidst the inflammation of the tunica vaginalis. The inflam- mation of the intestines is not a consequence of that of their peritoneal covering; and in the various acute catarrhal affections of organs in- wardly provided with mucous surfaces, and outwardly supplied with serous membranes, these are not seen inflamed, &c. In a word, the diseases of the mucous membranes are every where per- fectly distinct from those of the serous, although in general both contribute to the structure of the same organ. It is evident that so distinctive a line of demarcation between their affections must unavoidably suppose one between their organiza- tions. The life of their serous membranes is then completely distinct from that of their corre- sponding organs. There are cases, however, wherein these kind of membranes are so firmly attached to the organs they line, that frequently the sharpest knife will not separate them. We observe this between the tunica vaginalis testis and the tunica albuginea, the tunica arachnoides and the dura-mater, and between other membranes which form what I have called the sero-fibrous, &c. Such is the connexion between these surfaces that to this very day many have been mistaken for a single membrane. However there is no more identity of organization than where the serous membranes are more slightly united to their respective VOL. II Q Q

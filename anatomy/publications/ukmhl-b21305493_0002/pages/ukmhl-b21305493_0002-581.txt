639 MUCOUS SYSTEM. empty bladder \ then I compressed the filled blad- der in order to convey the oxygen to the other, by crossing the part of intestine left in the abdomen, and thus to keep on circulation through heat; by this means the oxygen was repeatedly con- veyed from one bladder to the other, forming a current in the intestine, which, considering its contractility, is not so easily effected as might at first be thought. The abdomen having subse- quently been opened, I observed no difference between the blood proceeding from that part of the intestine, and that which flowed from the others. The superficial situation of the mesenteric veins covered merely by a thin and transparent lamillae of the peritoneum, their size, if a large animal has been selected, will considerably facili- tate these comparisons. I was fullv convinced, that from what takes â€¢j place in the intestines, nothing can be inferred in respect to the pituitary membrane, the palate, &c. because, although similar, the organization may be different. Here, as in the intestines, the veinous blood returned from the parts cannot be examined. But, 1st. If it be considered that in animals which have breathed oxygen for some time, the pituitary membrane and palate are not found of a deeper red; 2dly. If we reflect, that the livid colour observed in various parts of this membrane in subjects suffocated by carbonic acid gas, does not deduce from the immediate

MUSCULAR SYSTEM 432 Of Sensible Organic Contractility considered in respect to the exciting Agents. The excitants are either natural or artificial. The action of the former is continued through- out life: upon these in part depend the pheno- mena of the organs; they stimulate the muscles, which without them would be immoveable; they are to these organs as it were, what pendulums are to our machines ; they give the impulsion : the latter can hardly produce any effect, but after death, or in our experiments. Natural Excitants. These are, the blood for the heart, the urine for the bladder, the food and the faeces for the gastric organs. Every organic muscle has a body which is always in contact with it, and keeps up its motions in the same manner as every animal muscle incessantly connected with the brain borrows its power of motion from that organ. The natural excitants maintain their or- gans in the same degree of motion as long as they remain the same. Every thing is alike in respect to the organs, the pulse does not vary, the diges- tive periods require the same time, the intervals that separate the excretions of urine are the same, as long as blood, chyle, or urine have undergone

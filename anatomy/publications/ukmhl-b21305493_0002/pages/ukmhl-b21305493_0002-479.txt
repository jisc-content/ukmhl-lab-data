OP ORGANIC LIFE. 437 with which it is impregnated that produce this ef- fect : they are then the excitants of these organs. Artificial excitants in general act differently; 1st. By contact only ; 2dly. By lacerating or mechanically dividing the fibres ; 3dly. By tend- ing to combine with them ; 4thly. There are some whose mode of action we are completely ignorant of; such is, for instance, electricity. Whenever the excitants act by contact only, the fluids ceteris paribus are more powerful than solids, because they stimulate by a greater num- ber of points; they not only excite the surfaces of the organ, but penetrate also the interstices of the fibres. The solids produce an effect propor- tionate with the extent of their excitement, with the degree of pressure, with their density, their softness, &c. In the ordinary state nature mos^ generally selects fluids for excitants. Laceration produces a greater degree of con- tact. The heart, the intestines, frequently inert when they are merely touched with the knife, contract powerfully when they are punctured. Section produces a less sensible effect than lace- ration. If divided transversely the fibres oscil- late and fluctuate by the sensible organic con- tractility, whilst, by the contractility of the tissue, they undergo a manifest contraction. The chemical agency is, in the greatest num- ber of cases, the most advantageous; but it is necessary to distinguish what belongs to shrink-

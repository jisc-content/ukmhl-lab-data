167 CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. maceration in water for the space of three or four days, they assume a very deep red colour. This hue does not penetrate very far; but if the carti- lage be divided in several parts, so as to expose more surface to the contact of the fluid, it will become completely red. The cartilages of ossi- fication display a similar phenomenon, that be- comes less striking as age advances ; so that in the greater part of adults the cartilages preserve their white appearance in maceration. In some individuals, however, they are still of a light pink, but it is not so deep as in the foetus. From what can this phenomenon proceed ? Does the water contain the cause of this colouration, or does this fluid rob the cartilage, by solution of cer- tain substances that prevent this phenomenon from being produced ? Whatever it may be, none of the articulating organs will redden in this manner ; all, on the contrary,â€”the synovial mem- brane, the ligaments, &c. become whiter. In general, there is no line of distinction drawn, in a sensible manner, at least, between the carti- lage intended for ossification, and that designed to remain such. Sometimes, however, a tarnished hue is observed in the ends of bones ; but these reddish streaks so frequently found irregularly disseminated in the cartilages for ossification, are never seen. As long as the process of ossification continues,

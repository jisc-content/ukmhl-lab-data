DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 760 which soon disappears when the blood is returned into the exhalents. This even especially distin- guishes the simple erysipelas from the phlegmon, wherein not only the external surface of the corium, but also its whole tissue and the subja- cent cellular membrane are inflamed. In measles, in scarlatina, in puerperal fever, the redness is most evidently only superficial. These pheno- mena coincide with those of injections. If they succeed ever so little with infants, the skin of the face, that of the other parts not quite so often, is almost completely blackened. Now this hue is much more evident in the external surface of the skin than in the internal part, and no doubt because the former contains more exhalents than the latter, which is merely crossed by the ar- terial trunks. The preceding considerations evidently prove that the areolar tissue of the internal surface of the corium, and even that of the anterior part, have much less vital activity than that of the external surface; that this tissue is unconnected with nearly every important phenomenon ot the skin, particularly with those which relate to sen-r- sation and circulation ; that the former belong to the papillae, and that the latter are seated in the rete mucosum : that it is left nearly in a passive state during almost all the active periods of that double portion of the dermis. The functions it is intended for, like those of the fibrous tissue, gene-

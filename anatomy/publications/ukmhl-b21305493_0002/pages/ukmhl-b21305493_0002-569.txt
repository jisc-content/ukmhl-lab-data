527 MUCOUS SYSTEM. in the analysis of the fluids in contact with the membranes we have just been mentioning, as in that of the urine, bile, gastric juices, &c. because it is very difficult, nay even impossible, to sepa- rate them from the mucous fluids. If we recollect what has previously been said respecting the extent of the two general mucous surfaces, equal, if not exceeding even that of the cutaneous organ, and then we represent to ourselves these two grand surfaces incessantly expelling the mucous fluids, it will be seen of what importance this evacuation must be in the economy, and what consequences may be attendant upon their injuries. To that law of nature commanding that every mucous fluid should be outwardly expelled, must partly be at- tributed the unctuous fluid which in the foetus fills the gall gladder, the meconium its intestines are gorged with, &c.: fluids apparently no- thing more than a collection of mucous juices, which stagnate until birth, without being absorbed from the respective organs where they have been secreted. Not only the mucous fluids are thus outwardly expelled, and in this manner serve as emunctories to the economy ; but moreover nearly all the fluids separated from the mass of the blood by se- cretion, are in the same case : this is evident in respect to the most considerable part of the bile ;

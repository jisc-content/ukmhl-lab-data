586 SEROUS SYSTEM. pressure ? The impossibility of resolving these questions, sufficiently proves it is not to any mechanical pressure, that both the production and the polish of the surfaces of the serous mem- branes should be attributed ; that their origin is the same as that of every other organ ; that in common with them they originate and are deve- loped ; that this polish is an evident result of their organisation, as the mucous papillae are de- pendent on the texture of the surfaces to which they belong. What would be thought of a system in which these papillae should be attributed to the pressure of food upon the stomach, of urine upon the bladder, of air upon the pituitary membrane, &c. The free surface of the serous membranes com- pletely separates the adjoining organs, over which these membranes are spread, so that these organs find in them actual limits, barriers, if I may be allowed the expression, or integuments, very dif- ferent, however, from those on the outward surface of the body": we should remark, in fact, that all the important viscera, the heart, the lungs, the brain, the gastric organs, the testes, &c. are confined by their serous envelope, suspended in the middle of the bag they form, and communi- cating with the adjacent parts, by that only through which their vessels penetrate. This isolated position, perfectly coincides with that separate mode of vitality observed in every

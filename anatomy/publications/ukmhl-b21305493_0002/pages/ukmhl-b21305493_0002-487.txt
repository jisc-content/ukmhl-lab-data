4 J5 OF ORGANIC LIFE. limbs; whilst the powers of digestion, and the force with which the urine is evacuated, &c. de- note the utmost energy of sensible organic con- tractility. I have remarked in this respect, that the powers of the heart are more frequently propor- tionate with the exterior muscles, than those of the stomach, of the intestines, and of the bladder. A full, strong pulse, coincides in general with an athletic constitution, whilst such a constitution is often united to a weak gastric system in the same subject, and more particularly strong powers of digestion are often combined with muscular de- bility. This fact, demonstrated by the different temperaments in man, is most evident in the se- ries of animals. Those which like the carnivorous species are endowed with great muscular powers, have the parieties of their gastric cavities mem- branous, as it were. These parieties strengthen in the herbivorous species: they become very striking in the gallinaceous species. In general, mastication, which depends upon animal contrac- tility, is in animals in a reverse ratio with the powers of trituration of the stomach, over which sensible organic contractility presides. 2dly. The varieties of this property, in what relate to constitutions, present another pheno- menon that hardly ever interferes with the mus- cular system of animal life. In fact, in this these varieties are always general; we may, indeed, strengthen by exercise, such and such a muscular

DLHMOIDAL SYSTEM. 768 especially contributes to the composition of the cutaneous organ ? I believe it bears the utmost analogy with the tissue of the fibrous system ; the following lines contain the considerations in sup- port of this analogy : 1st. In the heel, where the tissue of the dermis assumes the fibrous form of the irregular ligaments, it would hardly be possi- ble to distinguish it from the other, so very uni- form is its external appearance ; it has the same resistance and density ; the very same sensation is felt on dividing it with the knife; 2dly. The tissue of the dermis, as the fibrous, is rendered yellowish and transparent by boiling ; 3dly. Like this also, it is gradually diffused into gelatine ; 4thly. Like this again it resists maceration for a considerable length of time; 6thly. Sometimes these two tissues are blended together; for in- stance, the annular ligaments of the wrist evi- dently send prolongations to the adjacent cel- lular tissue; Gthly. This tissue, like the fibrous, gives insertions to muscles: this is seen in the face, where several of the fibres of the orbicular muscles of the lips and eyelids, nearly all those of the eyebrows, borrow from the fibres of the der- moidal tissue real tendons. There is the same ar- rangement in the cutis of the palm. All these considerations prove, in the most con- spicuous manner, the connections between the fibrous and dermoidal tissues. Identity, however, is very far from existing between these two tis- sues. To be convinced of this, it will be enough

OF ANIMAL LIFE. S97 phenomenon displayed by the muscular system in the progress of age, a phenomenon that ac- tually indicates the degree of contractile power. In old age the muscular tissue frequently dis- plays such an alteration, that for its natural hue a pale yellow and a greasy appearance are sub- stituted, although this aspect does not proceed from the fat, but from a total deficiency of the colouring matter of the blood : I have repeatedly made this remark. If the fat that envelopes these pretended greasy muscles be carefully removed, so that their tissue only is left, no animal oil will be extracted by combustion or ebullition ; they are found in their ordinary fibrous state, the colour only is different. I have observed that the deep muscles of the back, those situate in the vertebral notches, are much more liable than the rest to lose their colour and assume this yellow aspect, an aspect that never pervades the whole system, being found only in a few isolated muscles. Sub- jects of a middle age, as well as those advanced in years, are liable, though less frequently, to this alteration. A similar appearance has been ob- served in emaciated limbs; in cases of recent pa- ralysis, even in such as have lasted three, four, and six months, the muscles retain their colour and volume, but after a long space of .time, the absence of motion, and perhaps the deficiency of nervous influence, will eventually impair the H Pvocess Â°f nutrition, which has continued a long

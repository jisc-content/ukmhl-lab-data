OF ORGANIC LIFE. 467 SECTION III. Continuance of Contractions. The heart never remains in a state of perma* nent contraction, as is frequently the case with the voluntary muscles. Although hunger seem- ingly proves the contrary with respect to the stomach, and in the intestines, yet this phenome* non is not contradictory : in fact, the permanent contraction of the gastric viscera when empty, proceeds from the contractility of the tissue. When sensible organic contractility is brought into play, there are alternate contractions and dilatations: by this alternate state, essentially characterized, and distinguished from animal con- tractility, and from that of the tissue wherein contraction is frequently continued. SECTION IV. State of the Muscles during Contraction. v The phenomenon described as belonging to the voluntary muscles, are nearly all applicable to these, such as induration, increase of thickness, i reduction in length, expression of blood, &c. &c.; ' but in what regards the mode of contraction, B there is some difference between the heart and B the gastric muscles. In fact, in the former are h h 2

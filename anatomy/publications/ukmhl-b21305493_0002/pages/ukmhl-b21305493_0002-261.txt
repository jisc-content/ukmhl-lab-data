FIBROUS SYSTEM. 219 middle of the long and on the flat bones, which is easily conceived, from the greater number of apertures in the former than in the latter part. These prolongations attend the vessels lin- ing the ducts, by which the bones, in different parts, are perforated, and are lost in those which terminate in the substance: they do not penetrate the medullary canal, but solely restricted to the tissue of the bone, form between this and the mem- brane from whence they originate an intimate con- nexion. Such are the connexions, the destruction of which, when the periosteum is diseased, or se- parated to rather a considerable extent, causes the death and separation of the bone beneath. There is this distinction, however, between this phenomenon and the death of the bone, caused by the injury the medullary organ may have un- dergone ; that if this happens to be disorganized, the whole bone dies ; whereas, if the periosteum be irritated, or torn from the central part of a long bone, in an extent nearly equal to that of the medullary membrane, it is the external lay- ers only of the compact tissue that exfoliate, and the same bone remains. I have lately tried this experiment upon dogs. In what regards the re- moval of the periosteum, not only from the central part, but from the whole surface of the bone, I am not aware that it has ever been attempted.

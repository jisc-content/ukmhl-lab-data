60,5 SEROCJS SYSTEM obviously displaying the exhalents which were inscrutable in the natural state on account of the transparency of their fluids. 2ndly. When injected with very liquid fluids the serous surfaces are instantly covered with innumerable striae, of the same colour as the injected fluid, which are evidently exhalents filled with that fluid. Sdly. Whilst injecting, a fluid is often poured from the smooth surface of the serous membranes without laceration : this fluid does not transude, but is furnished by the exhalents. 4thly. If a serous surface be laid bare in a living animal and wiped dry, it will soon after be again covered with serum from the exhalents. Absorbents. From the texture of the serous membrane, it is evident that the lymphatic system essentially contributes to their formation; that they are probably nothing else than an interlacement of absorbents and exhalents; for we have ascer- tained that the cellular organ is an assemblage of them. But this assertion, dictated by analogy, is also supported by substantial proofs: 1st. The fluids of dropsy in the divers cavities varies in density and colour : now Mascagni has constantly observed that the neighbouring lymphatics con- tained a fluid perfectly similar. 2dly. The same author has observed in two different bodies effusions in the chest where the absorbents of the

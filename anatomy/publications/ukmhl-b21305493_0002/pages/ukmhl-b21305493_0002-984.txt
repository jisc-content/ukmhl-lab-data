942 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR- between the fingers, a kind of hair rises on the linger in the direction from bottom to top. This experiment, I say, seems to prove the existence of these imperceptible extentions, which contri- bute so much to attach the hairs together, so that when it has remained long uncombed, it cannot be dressed without great difficulty. Sometimes the ends of the hair evidently split. The difference of its nature depends upon the thickness of its sheath ; thick and dense over the genital parts, on the chin, &c., it is less susceptible of being permeated with water, and is therefore more elastic, and more curly. Thin and loose hair is smoother and is more under the in- fluence of the atmosphere.

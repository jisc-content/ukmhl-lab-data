950 SYSTEM OF THE HAIR. The extensibility and contractility of the tissue are very obscure in hair ; it is its resisting quality that prevents fracture; it hardly admits of ex- tension. When drawn out no animal sensibility is ob- servable, the pain resulting from it proceeding from the skin which it crosses : hence, by draw- ing a hair in a reverse direction, pain is more se- vere than by drawing it in the sense of the pores. I do not, however, pretend to deny that the exten- sions by which their roots are fixed to the adjacent parts may not also be the cause of the pain caused by this extension. These organs are not gifted with animal contractility. The internal substance of hair evidently pos- sesses organic properties. The different changes this substance undergoes can only proceed from au alteration of these properties. In the plica polonica, the organic sensibility and insensible contractility are increased to the utmost degree. To attain this degree of energy then, these pro- perties must necessarily have existed in the na- tural state. These are the two properties that the sympathies we have adverted to bring into play. This system does not possess organic sen- sibility. We cannot deny, however, that in their natural state these organs, after the epidermis and nails, are those in which life is less active, those which are the least connected with the other organs;

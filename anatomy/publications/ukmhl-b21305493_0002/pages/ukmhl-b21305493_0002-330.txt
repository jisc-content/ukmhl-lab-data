288 MUSCULAR SYSTEM \ gradually produced. When it has attained a certain degree, our food is sufficiently prepared for the table. We must remark, the muscle has not then been restored to the state it was in pre- vious to that of condensation. Amongst other phenomena that distinguish it perfectly from the latter, the following is very essential: it has lost the faculty of curling and becoming hard, either when under the influence of strong concentrated acids, as under that of alcohol, or particularly when again exposed to a high degree of caloric. In general it does not purify so readily, and its flavour, as is sufficiently known, is quite different. The loss of its principles by ebullition, is undoubt- edly one of the essential causes of these changes. When the muscle is exposed to the naked fire, as in roasting,the albumine condenses, the gelatine melts, the fibrine permeated with juices softens, the extractive substance, together with gelatine, and the dissolved salts, partly run from the organ: this is what constitutes gravy, which, as is suffi- ciently known, is very different from melted fat. The exterior of the meat is more solid than the interior; it is coloured by the extractive substance. The interior partly loses its natural hue: its consistence, taste, and even its composition, are completely changed. The fibres, as in ebullition, lose the power of shrinking and of curling from strong stimulants, particularly from fire. No part of the animal economy is sooner affected

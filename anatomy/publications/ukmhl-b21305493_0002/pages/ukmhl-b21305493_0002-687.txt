645 SYNOVIA 1; SYSTEM. that of the serous membranes ; that is to say, as a complete imperforated bag, every where continu- ous and formed over the organs of the articulation. Besides, do not the fibro-serous membranes present similar adhesions, although the isolated existence of the two sheets they are composed of, is gene- rally avowed ? From the idea we have formed to ourselves of the synovial membranes, it may be readily con- ceived how particular organs may cross the articulation, without synovia flowing from the aperture through which they are received, or from that through which they pass out. The synovial membrane then reflected round these organs, pro- vides them with a sheath, by which they are separated from the fluid and from the articula- tion. Thus the tendon of the biceps is no more contained within the shoulder joint, than the umbilical vein, the urachus, &c. are within the peritoneal cavity. It is easily removed from the membraneous portion by which its sheath is formed. The preceding considerations also establish a perfect identity between the synovial capsules of tendons, and the articulating synovial membranes. In the preceding instance, these two kinds of membranes are evidently continuous; for the capsule of the bicepital insertion is of the same nature as that of the tendons, which have an isolated one, as the flexors for instance.

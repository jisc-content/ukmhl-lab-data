362 MUSCULAR SYSTEM is to produce considerable effect with little power ; here we constantly observe considerable power to produce little effect, which is owing to the numerous causes that tend to destroy the ef- fects of these powers; 1st. Most generally the muscles act under very unfavourable circum- stances, as the power they represent is nearer to the point of pressure than the resistance is ; 2dly. All muscles on contracting have to encounter their antagonists ; 3dly. As in every motion there is always a fixed point, the effort which in conse- quence of the contraction bears upon that point is totally lost; 4thly. Motion is also impeded by friction ; Sthly. The obliquity of the insertions of muscles in bones, an obliquity which in general approaches much nearer the horizontal than the perpendicular direction. The not less remarkable obliquity of the fleshy insertions on the tendon or the aponeuroses, afford a twofold cause for re- ducing the motion. All these motives, and a multiplicity of others which might be added in common with Borrelli, who first made these im- portant remarks on muscular motion, prove that the absolute or real power of the muscles is much superior to their effective power. All, however, are not so disadvantageously placed ; in some, as in the soleus, the insertion is perpendicular with the bone ; in others, as in the muscles that act upon the head, it is observed they have the power of first rate levers in general.

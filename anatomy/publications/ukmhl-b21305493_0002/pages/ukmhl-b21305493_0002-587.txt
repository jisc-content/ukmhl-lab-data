545 MUCOUS SYSTEM. juices are probably exhaled from their respective mucous surfaces. But in general it is very diffi- cult to ascertain correctly in these organs what belongs to the exhalant system and what is fur- nished by that of the mucous glands, which, as we have seen, are everywhere subjacent to them. Thus are the mucous humours of the oesophagus, stomach, and intestines, constantly found mixed with the fluids of these organs. As on the one part the blood vessels twine almost bare over the mucous surfaces, and that on the other the exhaling organs constantly originate from these vessels, it is evident that these have but a short distance to over-run to reach their surfaces ; they are pores rather than distinct ves- sels. This undoubtedly explains why the blood has such a tendency to flow through the exhalants, consequently why hemorrhage, unattended with laceration, is [so frequently seen flowing from the mucous system; why that affection even may be included in the catalogue of the diseases proper to this system, &c. In no other system have the exhalants, by the manner in which the arteries are disposed, so short a space to over-run between their origin and their .termination; frequently even, as I have said, the blood of these vessels may, by pressure in the corpse, be forced through 1 their exhalants.

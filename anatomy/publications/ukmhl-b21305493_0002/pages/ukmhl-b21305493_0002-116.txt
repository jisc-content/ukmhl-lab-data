7,4 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. cave one, as the upper head of the radius: there is always a kind of ligament that completes the concave surface, and forms a ring, revolving over the bone, or on which the bone turns. Luxations here are not very frequent, because rotation being performed on the very axis of the bone, the ligaments are scarcely more distended on one side, than on the other, and consequently, are not so easily fractured, let the extent of the motion be what it may. The inferior part of the radius, might rather be considered as an excep- tion to this rule, because it is on the ulna, and not precisely its axis, that the bone in this part turns. In the leg, the motion of rotation, as we have noticed, is not the same as that of the fore arm ; that of the femur, which is considerably extended, compensates for this ; but in respect to the humerus and fore arm, the case is different, as is proved by the anchylosis of these parts. Fifth Genus. %â–  This genus is totally deprived of every kind of rotation, of opposition, and of circumduction. It includes the articulations of the carpus, meta- carpus, tarsus, metatarsus, of the vertebrae, in re- spect to their articulating apophyses, of the atlas with the occiput, of the humeral ends, of the

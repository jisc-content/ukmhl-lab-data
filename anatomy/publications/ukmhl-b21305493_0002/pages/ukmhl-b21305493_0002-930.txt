EPIDEIlMOIDA L SYSTEM* 888 ing; but by scraping with a knife the ex- ternal surface of the skin, which is then reduced into a kind of gelatinous pulp, the coloured rete mucosum is easily removed from it, although it still remains attached to a small portion of the corium. 5thly. Sulphuric acid,by which the skin, as every other organ, is diffused into a kind of pulpy state, is also successfully used to remove this coloured part, which comes off by shreds, but without the hue being affected. 6thly. Nitric acid, though rather concentrated, is not so effectual: it gives to the internal surface of the skin and epidermis a yellowish aspect; but does not appear to me to produce much of that effect on the black hue of the corpus reticulare. 7thly. If a portion of the Africanâ€™s skin be macera- ted a whole day in a solution of nitrate of silver, the colour appears to undergo no change. I have obtained the same result by trying a solution of potash. Sthly. Putrefaction removes the coloured portion of the skin, with the epidermis, at other times without it, but the colour is not altered. I have tried no other agents to ascertain the nature of the colour of the skin in negroes. But let us return to a consideration of the epidermis. Wherever it is very thick, as in the concave surface of the foot and hand, it is most evidently found composed of laminae, and which, owing to their close attachment, are not easily separated.

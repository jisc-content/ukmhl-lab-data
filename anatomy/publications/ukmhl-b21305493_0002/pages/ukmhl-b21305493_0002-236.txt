194 FIBIIOUS SYSTEM. ca, and albuginea, in the tumefactions of their re- spective organs. This extensibility in the fibrous system is sub- jected to a permanent law, that does not relate to the extensibility of the other systems; it can be effected only in a slow, gradual, and insensible manner, so that whenever it is too abruptly brought into action, two different phenomena will ensue, both of them admitting of an equal impossibility of sudden extension, observable in a muscle, the skin, the cellular tissue, &c.; 1st, If the resistance of the fibrous organ be superior to the effort it experiences, it will not gi ve way, and different accidents are the result. Instances of them are met with in the inflammatory obstruc- tions that form under the aponeuroses of the limbs, under those of the skull, within the fibrous sheaths of the tendons, &e. ; then these different fibrous organs, not calculated to extend with the same rapidity as the subjacent parts that swell, painfully compress those tumefied parts, and sometimes even make them liable to gangrene : this is actually the case in those con- tractions, so frequently met with in surgical practice, and which render various operations necC5sary; 2dly, If the fibrous organ be inferior in resistance iC the sudden effort it is exposed to, it is parted instead of yielding; hence the rupture of tendons, the lacerations of the fibrous capsules, and ligaments in luxations, those oi the apo-

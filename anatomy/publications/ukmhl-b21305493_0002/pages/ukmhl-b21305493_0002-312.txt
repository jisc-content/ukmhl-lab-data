MUSCULAR SYSTEM 270 bones ; as we find in the brachialis internus, the adductors, the pectinoei, &c. They are separated by cellular layers; loose in parts, in which extensive motions are performed ; tight wherever these motions are more confined, and very thick where vessels and nerves glide under the muscular fasciculi. These are frequently separated from each other by a greater or less space filled with cellular tissue. The long muscles have been divided into single and compound; single when composed of an isolated skain only ; compound when they result from the assemblage of several. These fasciculi then act in two dif- ferent ways; sometimes, in fact, it is in the su- perior part the division is seen, as in the brachial and femoral biceps; at other times it is interiorly : in the most moveable part the division is met with, as in the flexors and extensors of the leg, and of the fore-arm. The long muscles frequently separated from each other, are sometimes held together by inter- posed aponeuroses, which confound together more or less of two, three, and even four of these adjoining organs. The origin of the muscles of the internal and external tuberosities of the hu- merus, are thus disposed, and hence, in the ge- neral motions of the limbs, essential advantage is derived. Then, in fact, the contraction of each muscle acts in moving, below, the moveable point to which it is inserted, and in securing, above, the

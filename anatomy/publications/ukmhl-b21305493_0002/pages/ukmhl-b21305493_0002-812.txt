This is proved by injections, in which the face colours with the utmost facility. There is not an anato- mist, I dare say, who has not occasionally been struck with this phenomenon, in infants particu- larly, in which, if the coarse injections of our dissecting rooms pass but very imperfectly, the face becomes quite black, whilst very little fluid penetrates the other parts of the cutaneous system ; Sdly. It appears that there is a quicker sensibi- lity in the face : in fact, the stimulant w7hich attracts the blood to that part does not act with the same force elsewhere; for instance, a blow upon the ear will redden the cheeks more than a similar blow applied to the arms, &c.

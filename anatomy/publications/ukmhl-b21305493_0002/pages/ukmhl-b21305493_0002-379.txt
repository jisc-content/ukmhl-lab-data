OF ANIMAL LIFE. 337 the nerves, in the same manner as nerves are be- tween the muscles and that organ ; the principle that constitutes will, first acts upon the brain, which subsequently re-acts. When thus produced, our motions are sometimes determined and regu- lar : it is when the intellectual functions are sound, when memory, imagination, and perception are in all their plenitude, that judgment being cor- rect, governs with regularity every act of the will:—at other times they are irregular ; as, when the intellectual functions variously disordered, produce an irregular and fantastic will, as in the different mental alienations, in dreams, in those ravings of fevers, &c.; but in all such instances they still are voluntary motions, and proceed from the immaterial principle by which we are animated. In the second class of causes which influence the brain, animal contractility becomes involun- tary ; it is exercised without the participation of the intellectual principle, frequently even against its will. Only observe the animal whose brain is artificially excited in our experiments ; he stiffens to oppose contractions—they take place in spite of him. If a nerve be punctured in an operation, the muscle will spontaneously contract below, without the mind interfering with the motion ; the patient is not even sensible of it, he is only sensi- ble of pain. If a great quantity of blood in the de- lirium of inflammatory fevers, be propelled to the brain, this organ, excited by the fluid, instantly vol. it. z

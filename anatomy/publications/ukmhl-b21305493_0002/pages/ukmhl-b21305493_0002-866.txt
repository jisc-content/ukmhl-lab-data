DERM01 DAL SYSTEM. 824 been, introduced in the method used in former times. Muscular contraction is effected more rapidly, but this being more lasting eventually predominates; so that in the former mode of per- forming amputation, in which all the parts were cut on a level, the stump assumed a conical form, the bone forming the summit, then the muscles and arteries, &c. came in succession, and it was terminated towards the limb by the skin that formed the basis. There are many instances, however, in which the extensibility of the dermis is not so very con- siderable as might be thought. For instance, in large sarcoceles, the skin of the parts adjoining the scrotum being drawn, covers the tumour, and is substituted to the deficiency of extensibility of the skin in this part: that of the penis in par- ticular, is almost completely drawn to cover the tumour, so that the organ disappears. To the want of sufficient extensibility, the following phe- nomenon must also be referred :â€”in a wound attended with loss of substance, the granulations on contracting by the evacuation of the whitish humour they contain, draw the surrounding skin over the wound : in this case the skin is not merely extended, but actually moved. This ex- plains why, in those parts where the skin is naturally stretched, and adheres, it will not ad- mit of such locomotion, and cicatrization is ob- taihed with difficulty, as is instanced on the era-

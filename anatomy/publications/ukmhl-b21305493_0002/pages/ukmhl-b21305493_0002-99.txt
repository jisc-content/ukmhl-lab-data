57 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. stroyed in the osseous system, and is ultimately completely annihilated whenever the calcareous part predominates very considerably: this is ex- actly the case when, in consequence of necrosis, the horns and the crustaceous coverings, &c. fall. We may also ascertain the exact degree of vita- lity an organ is possessed of, by the rapidity with which the different stages of inflammation suc- ceed each other, and the frequency of this affec- tion in that organ. Now, inflammations in bones are more rapid in proportion to the quantity of cartilaginous substance which the affected organ contains. Let us remark the different periods of the healing of bones at the different ages, periods measured by the length of inflammation indispen- sable for the formation of callus; we shall find them shorter and more frequent in the infant, and much longer in the aged subject, and that fre- quently they will not consolidate, whilst it is ef- fected with the utmost facility in all soft parts. The general decay of the vital powers from age is, without doubt, one cause of the slowness or rapidity with which callus forms at the two most distant stages of life ; but the different pro- portions of the gelatinous and calcareous sub- stances have also a considerable influence : for, let other cicatrizations be compared with these, the cutaneous for instance, the difference, esta-

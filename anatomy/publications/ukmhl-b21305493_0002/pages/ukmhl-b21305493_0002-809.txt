It is not permeated with blood in the natural state, but a variety of courses may at every mo- ment cause it to be permeated with that fluid. If the skin be rubbed briskly it becomes red; if a stimulant be applied to it, whether this be me- chanical, or it consists of the small appendices of the plant penetrating the epidermis, or that it excites a chemical action, as in frictions with am- monia, or as when apart of the skin is held very close to a brisk fire, &c. the sensibility of this vascular net is instantly excited ; the blood pre- viously repelled is attracted to the part, which reddens in proportion to the extent of the ir- ritation. By powerful passions the cheeks are suddenly flushed, and every external application also affords proofs of the excessive tendency the superficial capillary system of the dermis has to become connected, if ever so little ex- cited, with the blood foreign to it in the na- tural state. Blisters act upou the same principle. The first effect, is to fill with blood the cutaneous capillary system wherever they are applied, sub- sequently to produce an abundant exhalation of serum under the epidermis. A few hours only are required for their producing the effect which in erysipelas requires a succession of days, for we know they most generally terminate by vesicles or phlycteenae over the skin.

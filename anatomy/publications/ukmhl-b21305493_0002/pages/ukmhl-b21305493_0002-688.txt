646 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. Organization. We have just seen that the synovial membrane approaches very much to the class of serous mem- branes ; the same similitude is observed in respect to its internal organization. This organization is especially cellular, as is proved by drying, inflat- ing, and particularly by macerating them. The bag formed by ganglions is evidently nothing but a produce of the cellular organ : Now it is perfectly known, that this bag contains and ex- hales a fluid similar to synovia. Wherever the synovial membrane is free, it is attached outwardly to this organ, and so intimately connected with it, that by successively removing the different layers, they are seen gradually to condense, and finally to unite closely together. In these as in the serous membranes, no fibres are distinct: when perfectly insulated, they become transparent, which is easily effected in the knee, to a considerable extent. I shall not enter into a repetition of the various circumstances, by which the cellular structure of the serous system is established ; almost all of them are applicable to the synovial organ, which appears to be nothing more than an interlacement of exhalents and absorbents. Hence it is easily conceived what are these reddish and greasy bun- dles, disseminated around the articulations. They fulfil in respect to this membrane, the functions ol the abundant cellular tissue, in which the pcrito-

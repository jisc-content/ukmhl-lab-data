185 FIBROUS SYSTEM. is, that if in a corpse, a weight be suspended to a muscle detached at one end from the bone, the fleshy and not the tendinous part will be ruptured. The fibrous tissue has been considered by some anatomists, as being nearly of the same nature as the muscular tissue, and even as being some- times a continuation of it. Thus, it has been said? that the tendon merely resulted from an assem- blage of the fleshy fibres, which, without chang- ing their nature, were only deprived of their hue. Thus, the aponeuroses for envelopement, have been considered as formed by the pressure of the surrounding bodies upon the exterior of fleshy fibres. To prove how such an opinion is ill grounded, it is sufficient to remark, 1st, that the dura-mater, the tunica sclerotica, the periosteum, and the ligaments, are evidently of the same nature as the tendons and the aponeuroses, and that they completely differ from the muscular tissue. 2dly, that the chemical composition, the vital proper- ties, the apparent texture, are completely distinct in the tendinous fibre, from what they are in the muscular. 3dly, that there is no kind of con- nection between the functions of the one and those of the other. There certainly is less analogy be- tween the muscle and the tendon that receives its insertion, than between this last, and the bone that supplies it with one, and with which organ the cartilaginous part bear a similitude in its na-

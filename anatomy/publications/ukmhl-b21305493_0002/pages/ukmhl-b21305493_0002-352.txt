310 MUSCULAR SYSTEM It is particularly when the muscles have been previously distended, and the cause of distention is removed, that the contractility of the tissue be- comes evident. The operation for ascites and delivery in respect to the abdominal muscles, the opening' of deep collections for those of the trunk, the extirpation of any tumour, &c. display this property in action, in the most obvious light. In this respect, however, it ought to be remarked, that if the extension has been rather long conti- nued, or too frequently repeated, the consequent contraction will be less, because the muscular i tissue has been weakened by the painful state in which it has been kept: hence, 1st. The flaccidity of the abdomen resulting from repeated preg- nancies ; 2dly. The laxity of the scrotum subse- quent to the puncture of an old hydrocele; 3dly, I have seen at M. Desaultâ€™s, a man from whom a fungus in the mouth had been removed in Germany, and who on that side of the face where the disease had existed, had very large wrinkles, owing to a greater extent of the fleshy layer on that part which could no longer contract like the other, mastication at that time being performed on the sound side only; 4thy. When- ever women have borne many children, the dia- phragm is weakened by repeated pressures ; hence partly proceeds the greater mobility of the sides, that in females compensates for a deficiency of the action in this muscle. 1 am induced to think.

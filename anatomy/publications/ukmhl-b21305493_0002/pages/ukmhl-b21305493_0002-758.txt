GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 716 To this must also be referred the divers catarrhs proceeding from the presence of an irritating body on one of these surfaces. The child by sucking and exciting the nipple, causes a secretion of milk, whilst at the same time he draws in the fluid, &c. In the morbid state, the glands are also fre- quently the seat of passive sympathies, now in such cases the organic sensibility and insensible contractility are generally brought into action. The increase of animal sensibility from sympathy will rarely give pain. We have enumerated the astonishing varieties observed in glands, both in respect to the quan- tity, and to the quality of the fluids they separate. Now all these varieties especially proceed from sympathetic influence. Let us only observe the salivary glands filling the mouth with fluid, or leaving it dry, with a viscid humour, or a limpid one, frothy, or fluent; the mucous glands of the tongue furnishing sometimes a thick and whitish slime, at others a blackish crust, &c.

Nature has so far connected these parts by sympathy, that the instant the mucous ' surface of the latter is diseased, that it has be- come the seat of that kind of discharge called disordered stomach, foul stomach, &c. then that of the other al$o becomes aflected, and furnishes a

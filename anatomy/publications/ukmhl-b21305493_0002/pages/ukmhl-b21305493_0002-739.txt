GLANDULAK SYSTEM. <597 this habitual motion, impressed upon the glands by the approach of the blood, should be added, , that imparted by the adjacent organs, and which keeps up an habitual excitement still more neces- sary for their secretion than for their excretion. In the action of organs, the habitual motion by which they are agitated, has been too much dis- regarded. The example afforded by the brain should have guided the attention of physiologists in this respect. The veins every where continuous with the arteries, have in the glandular system a similar dis- tribution ; they attend them almost every where. As in many other organs a division into superfi- cial and deep seated arteries is not observed. The liver affords the only instance in which the red blood penetrates on one side, and the dark blood flows out from the opposite one. The greater part of the veins of the glandular system pour their blood into the general system of the dark circulation, and as several glands lay very near the heart, the reflux to which this system is frequently liable is felt by them. This phenomenon is particularly remarkable in the liver, where the hepatic veins open but imper- fectly under the right auricle. This explains why every time this auricle is considerably distended, as in asphyxia, or where the lungs being obstructed oppose an obstacle to the blood, the liver is gorged with a much greater quantity of this fluid.

There is a means, however, which might secure the permanency of the dye, even in organs which being of similar delicacy as the skin, are liable to habitual decomposition ; this mode is to apply the colour with a red hot iron. The let- ters and figures sailors and soldiers stamp upon their skins with a red hot needle for the purpose, and the impression which subsists for such a length of time, is not only seated in the epider- mis, but also in the corium. Development. In the foetus, the skin has not yet receded from its pulpy state, when the nails have already acquired a remarkable degree of consistence: though very thin, their thickness and consistence follow a progressive course with the growth of the foetus. Their length at birth is not propor- tionate to what these organs will subsequently acquire. They never exceed the tip of the fin- ger, but are often shorter; so that, it is only after birth, that these organs acquire that length and curved form, unnecessary in the womb, since the foetus had there nothing to grasp. Owing to their transparency at birth, the dark hue of the blood which first circulated through the arteries,and then the vermilion aspect suddenly acquired by respiration, are very conspicuous through them. In proportion as age advances, these organs in-

SYSTEM OF THE EPIDERMIS. If objects are examined with even the slightest attention, it will not be difficult to perceive the immense difference that exists between the pre- ceding system and this, which physiologists have considered as a part of the latter. In the organ- ization, properties,composition, functions, growth, &c., there is nothing similar in them : a bare inspection is sufficient to mark the line that sepa- rates them.

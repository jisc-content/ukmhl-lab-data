MUCOUS SYSTEM. 538 The following is an experiment I have tried to ascertain this fact. I have drawn through a wound, intentionally made in the abdomen, a portion of intestine which I tied ; I then re- turned it, reduced the wound, and kept a por- tion of that organ outwardly, which was also opened for inflation by atmospheric air, with which the whole part anterior to the ligature was filled. I then tied the intestine under the liga- ture and the whole was reduced. After an hour had elapsed, the animal was opened; I compared the blood of the mesenteric veins which arose from the part of the inflated gut, with that of the other mesenteric veins arising from the remainder of this tube, and found no difference in the colour; the internal surface of the part of intestine distended was not of a brighter red. I thought I should obtain a better effect, by repeating this experi- ment with oxygen gas on another animal; but even then I could observe no change in the colour of the blood. On the mucous mem- branes which commonly are in contact with air, this fluid is incessantly renewed, and kept in con- stant motion, but in the preceding experiment it had remained stagnant. I have attempted to produce the same effect in the intestines. I have made two apertures in the abdomen, and drawn through each a portion of intestine. I have adapted to one of these parts the tube of a blad- der filled with oxygen, to the other that of an

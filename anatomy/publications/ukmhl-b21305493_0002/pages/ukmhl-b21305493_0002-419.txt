OF ANIMAL LIFE. 377 Compound Motions. There are but very few single motions in the economy ; but very few muscles that contract in an isolated manner. Almost every kind of con- traction supposes another; and this is the reason, the two points by which a muscle is commonly inserted have an equal tendency to move : if one of the two were not prevented, both then would come into motion when the muscle contracts: thus, by the contraction of the extensors, the leg would be brought almost as near to the foot, as the foot is to the leg, if this were not fixed : but it can only be so, by the muscles acting in a reverse sense to the extensors; now, when- ever the two points of attachment are move- able, the isolated motion of one of the two, sup- poses the contraction of divers muscles to fix the other. No other muscles than those inserted by one of their extremities to a fixed, and by the other to a moveable point, as those of the eye, the greatest part of those of the face, are enabled to move in an isolated manner without requiring any motion in other muscles. Let us remark, however, that in general the contraction intend- ed to fix the point, which, in the ordinary mo- tions must remain the immoveable point is less considerable than might be thought at first.

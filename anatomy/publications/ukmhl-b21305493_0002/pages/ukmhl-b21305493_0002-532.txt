It is continued through the large and small intes- tines, and finally terminates in the anus, where it is identified with the skin. The second general mucous membrane, that we have called genito-urinary, penetrates in man through the urethra, and from thence is distributed on the one part over the bladder, the ureters, the pelvis of the kidnies, the infundibula, the papil- lae, and the capillary tubes, that open at their summit; on the other part it enters the excretory tubes of the prostate gland, the ejaculatory ducts, the vesiculae seminales, the vasa deferen- tia, and the innumerable folds from which they originate. In the female this membrane enters the vulva, and continuing on the one part through the ure- thra, is extended, as in man, over the urinary organs ; on the other part it is seen to enter and line the vagina, as well as the uterus and fallo- pean tubes, and is subsequently continued with the peritoneum through the aperture of these tubes. This is the only instance, in the economy , of a communication between the mucous and serous surfaces. This manner of describing the course assumed by the mucous surfaces, by saying, they enter into, are continued with, &c. from one cavity to another, is certainly not conformable to the course that nature follows, which creates in every

GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 690 ture; in this respect they might be divided into two classes. All the salivary glands, the pancreatic, the laerymal, all the glands with a granulated and whitish parenchyma, are liberally supplied with this tissue. Every glandular body is divided into very distinct lobes, separated from each other by fur- rows filled with this tissue, which gives the ex- terior of this species of glands a knobby appear- ance : not only each lobe, but each separate lobe, each grandular grain even is also immersed in cellular tissue. This species of glands actually form, in this respect, an assemblage of small bodies, distinct from each other, which, if they were insulated, would as effectually fulfil their functions. This is frequently observed over the parotids, where various accessory glands are fre- quently met with in the course of stenonâ€™s duct, and which are perfectly independent of the princi- pal gland. The sub-maxillary and the sublingual glands, &c. are sometimes united ; at other times they are perfectly isolated. The cellular tissue is frequently overloaded with fat in these kind of glands. This is particularly striking in the mam- mae, the volume of which, at times, proceeds from the glandular tissue, as in young females, where this system predominates over the fat, and sometimes from the predominance of this fluid, as is seen when these organs, in middle aged women, retain a considerable size. This difference is readily

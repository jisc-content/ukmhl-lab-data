GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 735 sensibility, so far torpid as it were, is roused; they feel the contact effected by the approach of the blood, which till then had made but a very slight impression upon them. This sensation is so much the more delicate, as the organic sensibility of the glands is better developed, and as the red blood is â€¢ a more powerful stimulant than the dark; for, as I have already had frequent opportunities of repeat- ing the observation, two effects are produced on the blood that reaches an organ, the one to excite it either by the motion it imparts, or by, the con- tact of the principles it contains, and the other to supply it with the materials for divers functions, as exhalation, secretion, nutrition, &c. The former effect is shared in common by all organs in which blood is circulated ; the latter is peculiar to each. I have remarked, however, that many of the secretions are much less energetic during the early stage of infancy, than at a more advanced period. Such are those of the salivary glands, of the liver, &c. The kidneys being intended to throw off the residue of digestion, as much and even more than that of nutrition, are in a state of activity'proportionate with the first of these functions. The evacuation of urine in the child takes place as often as that of the faeces. This does not proceed from an abundance of substances being returned from the organs to the kidneys, after having contributed to their nutrition, to be expelled through that channel.

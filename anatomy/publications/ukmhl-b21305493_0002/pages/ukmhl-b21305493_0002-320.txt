MUSCULAR SYSTEM 278 have a considerable extent, and very little power of motion; whilst those provided with short fibres only, but excessively multiplied, so as to insure to the whole a considerable length, are re- markable for a reverse disposition.The reason is as follows: As every fibre being equal in thickness, let its length be what it may, has the same degree of strength, it is evident that the aggregate of this power in a muscle, must be measured by the number of its fibres. On the other hand, the longer the fibre the more it will shorten on contracting; then by contraction, the body of a muscle is drawn nearer to the two points of at- tachment, in proportion to the length of its fibres. All the fibres of the voluntary muscles are straight, the sphincters excepted ; they lay ei- ther parallel to each other, as the rhomboidei, or obliquely, as in the pectoralis major. Sometimes in the same muscle, several layers crossing each other following different directions, are seen, as we find, in the masseter; but this intersection is quite different from that met with in the invo- luntary muscles, wherein a plexus of fibres is also seen, whilst in this instance fasciculi follow- ing different directions, placed in apposition, only are to be found. I shall not at present speak of the cylindrical form, according to some, or the globular form, according to others, assumed by the fleshy fibre.

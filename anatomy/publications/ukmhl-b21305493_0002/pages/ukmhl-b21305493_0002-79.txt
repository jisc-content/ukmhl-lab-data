OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 37 vessels, nerves, and other organs, from one region to another, is lined throughout with a compact layer that protects them from the impression of those parts. The foramina at the basis of the skull, the sockets of the teeth, of the vidian nerves, &c. are instances of this disposition. Of the Composition of the Bony Tissue. Whatever maybe the modifications under which it is represented, this tissue is everywhere of the same nature ; it is formed of the same elements, and these elements are especially a saline, calca- reous, and a gelatinous substance. In bones, the existence of the first, is proved in different ways: 1st, Combustion, by destroying the gelatinous parts, leaves a friable, brittle sub stance,of a similar form with that of the bone, which is nothing else than this saline substance, resem- bling, as it were, a moulded form that retains the shape after the mould has been removed. If combustion be carried too far, and the calcined bone become red, it will undergo a semi-fusion similar to that of porcelain; then it assumes a light fine texture, half vitrified, semi-transparent, and that aspect, in short, that characterizes vitri- fied earthy substances ; 2d. The exposure of a bone to atmospheric air, when continued for a considerable time, will produce nearly a similar

11B U O US SYSTEM. 227 tehdinous fibres,â€”even by tendons proceeding from the adjoining muscles, are outwardly sur- rounded with abundance of cellular tissue: they are sometimes perforated to give pas- sage to these tendons, which are fixed to the bone between them and the synovial mem- branes, as the scapulo-humeral articulation in respect to the sub-scapularis, is an instance. Ana- tomists having observed that tendons were in- serted in the capsules, have concluded from this, that the muscles of these tendons were intended to prevent the capsules from being compressed be- tween the articulating surfaces, when in motion. This appears probable to me ; but the muscles are at least intended, during extensive motions, to prevent the laxity of the capsule, which would otherwise have been weakened by that laxity : thus is the capsule of the shoulder-joint provided with several of these muscles, whilst none are observed in that of the femur, which, as I have before stated, is much tighter. These cap- sules are within very closely united with the sy- novial membrane, particularly in the adult; for in infants the adhesion is less. Towards their ex- tremities, however, this connection is deficient, because the synovial membrane by reflecting over the cartilage leaves between it and the cap- sule that proceeds to enter to the bone a trian- gular space ; and as this disposition is continued around the articulation, a kind of circular canal Q 2

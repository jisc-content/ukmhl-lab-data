OF ANIMAL LIFE. 3] 3 admitting of a few distinctions only, answer to its dead power, and those produced by alcohol fire, concentrated acids, &c. on animal sub- stances, which shrink and contract by the effects of these different agents : but the following dif- ferences will essentially distinguish these pheno- mena. 1st. The contractility of the tissue is not very weak in organs evidently endowed with very great powers of contraction ; for instance, in every organ belonging to the fibrous, fibro- cartilaginous, serous systems, &c. &c. 2ndly. The contractility of the tissue is distributed throughout the body in very variable proportions : from the muscles and the skin, that possess this faculty in the highest degree, to cartilages which do not seem to possess it, there are innumer- able variations; the faculty of hardening under the effects of the above-mentioned agents on the contrary, is uniformly bestowed, or at least its differences are much less striking. 3rdly. The one is destroyed in organs that have been dried, the other is retained for a long series of years : parchment is a proof of it. 4thly. The former evidently receives, particularly in muscles, addi- tional energy from life ; the latter hardly seems modified by it. 5thly. This is invariably at- tended with sudden effects, with rapid contrac- tion. To feel the contact of fire, of concen- trated acids and alcohol, and to contract, are, in regard to animal parts, phenomena that occur at

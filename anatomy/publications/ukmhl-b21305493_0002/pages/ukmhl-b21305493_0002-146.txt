OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 104 not admit of combustion, but bursts in the fire, and thus separates from the other tissue, which, when exposed to caloric, at first blackens, and subsequently burns like every other bone, and exhales the same smell. Is the enamel organized, or is it merely a juice which, at first transuding from the external surface of the tooth, hardens and concretes ? This question will not, I think, be easily solved. The enamel, in fact, is possessed of properties that seem to admit of these two opinions with equal probability. On the one part it enjoys sensibility in common with every other organized part; it feels the sensations caused by contact, more evidently than the hair and the nails; the diluted acids, especially those borrowed from vegetables, exalt its sensibility to such a degree, that the slighest contact is attended with great pain a long time even after their application. The teeth then, ac- cording to the vulgar expression, are said to be set on edge. On the other hand, the enamel has many properties that seem to deny the existence of or- ganization ; 1st. It never admits of combustion; is never the seat of any tumour, of any alteration tending to soften its tissue ; it is never seen to undergo any change by which its vitality is in- creased beyond the natural state ; such, for in- stance, as is the case with hair, which, although generally inert, displays, however, in the plicae polonicee, very great vital activity. In fact, we

369 OF ANIMAL LIFE. SECTION IV. State of the Muscle during Contraction. The muscles on contracting, present divers phenomena, which are as follows :â€” 1st. They become evidently harder, as may easily be ascertained by placing the hand on the masseter, the temporal, or on any other super- ficial muscle whatever, when contracted. 2dly. They increase in thickness: hence the stronger projection of every sub-cutaneous mus- cle, whilst the body is in violent agitation. The sculptor is sensible of this difference. The figure that moves, is represented very differently from that at rest. Sdly. When the muscles are not maintained by the aponeuroses, they sometimes undergo slight displacements. 4thly. They decrease in length, and therefore their two insertions are brought nearer together. 5thly. Their volume remains nearly the same; what is lost in the length, is nearly compensated for by the thickness. The question whether this proportion is very exact, and of which so much has been said since it was proposed by Glisson, is not deserving of attention. 6thly. The blood contained in the vessels of the muscles, in the veins particularly, is partly ex- pressed ; the very act of bleeding proves it; for VOL. II. B B

FIBRO-CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 264 As they are hardly ever diseased, scarcely any thing can be said of their sympathies. I could not quote a single instance. ARTICLE IV. Developement of the Fibro-Cartilaginous System, SECTION i. State of that System in the early Age. In the early period of our existence, the arti-^ culating fibro-cartilages are tolerably developed, owing probably to the width of the articulations at that time. In fact, as the extremities of bones are proportionally much larger, whilst they re- main cartilaginous, than when they have become ossified, the articulations also are proportionally much larger, and the organs they contain more striking. The fibro-cartilages of insertions, nearly all situated as is sufficiently known, at the extremi- ties of the long bones, are not in the early stage of life distinct from the cartilages of ossification that form these ends at that age. Confused to- gether, no distinctive line is to be seen when the bone is divided on a level with them. This state subsists until ossification is com- pleted 5 then the fibro-cartilages of insertions,*

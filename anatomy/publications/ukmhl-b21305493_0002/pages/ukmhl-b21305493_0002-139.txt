The blood might be overloaded with earthy and gelatinous principles, yet the bones will reject these principles as long as their mode of sensibility does not harmonize with them. The twofold motion of nutrition is always con- tinued in bones, in proportion as we gradually advance in years ; but its proportions alter, gela- tine progressively declines, and; the earthy sub- stance assumes an increasing ratio. Finally, in extreme old age, this last substance predominates to such a degree, that it would annihilate life in these organs, if general death did not anticipate the partial event. To this, the grayish hue which these organs then assume must be attributed; hence also'proceed their progressively increasing weight; hence, consequently, the difficulties that attend the motions of the limbs, since, as the muscular powers are gradually destroyed by age, the bony resistance they have to contend with in- creases. At that stage of life, the calcareous substance predominates in the economy to such a degree, that it invades different organs, such as the arteries, the cartilages, the tendons, which then assume a bony character. It might be said, that by thus accumulating, in our parts, a substance uncon- VOL. II. H

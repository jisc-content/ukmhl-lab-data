EPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 894 seems to be of the same nature as that which Bertholet has extracted from hair in such abun- dance ; combustion leaves after it a blackish coal, which I have not analysed. Light seems to have no great effect upon the epidermis, which I have found of the same colour, both in skins rendered darker by it, and those that were not. The epidermis is evidently turned yellow by nitric acid, and much more so than any other ani- mal substance; but is not dissolved by it without the utmost difficulty. The sulphuric acid, on the con- trary, acts very powerfully upon this organ, par- ticularly if it be rather concentrated. On being withdrawn, after having remained therein some time, it is found excessively thin, remarkably trans- parent, and almost similar in this respect to the peeling of an onion. I have repeatedly been struck with this singular phenomenon. If left too long in this liquor it will be completely dis- solved. Alkaline solutions also dissolve this membrane, but only slowly ; pure alkali has a very rapid effect. Alcohol is wholly useless ds a solvent. SECTION III. Properties. The epidermis does not admit of being much extended, since the slightest cutaneous tumour,'

CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 147 encompassed by the cartilage ; there has been no such thing as a solution of continuity. In ge- neral, the aspect of the cartilaginous parenchyma, isolated from its earthy portion, is quite different from that of the real cartilage. This distinction, I presume, proceeds from the quantity of gelatine that is more considerable in the second than in the first. The action of acids, particularly that of the nitric, is the most advantageous means of separating a cartilage from the head of the bone ; maceration requires considerable time to produce this effect; in ebullition it is less apparent, because the gelatine is in a state of fusion. The surface of the cartilage opposed to the bone, is intimately united with the synovial mem- brane of the articulation. From this it derives the polish that characterizes it; for, wherever these substances do not correspond with this mem- brane, they lose that character, as we see in the larynx, in the'cartilages of the ribs, &c. Here the medium of adherence is a cellular tissue excessive- ly tight, that cannot be removed by^heets, by maceration, nor by dissection. As the synovial membrane is completely formed of this tissue, it appears, that over the cartilage, it is nothing more than an extension of that which, after having con- tributed to the contexture of that organ, is con- densated over its surface, and formed into a menu- brane. l 2

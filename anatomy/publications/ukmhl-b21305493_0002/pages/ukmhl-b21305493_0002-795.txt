In the sole of the foot, and in the palm of the hand, a multiplicity of whitish fibres are ob- served, these fibres shining like the aponeurotic fibre, and originating from this internal surface, form a new layer over it, as it were ; they inter- weave in every direction, leaving between them, particularly towards the heel, a number of areolae, more or less extended, filled with'fat, gradually widening, and finally lost in the subcutaneous tissue, nearly in the same manner as the fibres of the brachial aponeurosis are insensibly lost in the adjacent cellular tissue. This explains why, on dissecting the integuments of the sole and of the palm, the complete separation of these fibres from the cellular tissue with which they are blended is attended with so much difficulty; it also shows why these surfaces are not possessed of that motion observed in the others. The density of the cellular tissue also comes in for its share in this arrangement essential to the functions of the feet and hands, which are intended to seize and grasp external bodies. 2dly. The dermis of the upper and lower ex- tremities, that of the back, neck, chest, abdomen, and even of the face, consequently nearly of the whole body, are distinct from the preceding; first, inasmuch as the fibres are much less distinct 3 c VOL.

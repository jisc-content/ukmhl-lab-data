^02 FIBROUS SYSTEM. \ preceding systems, may also be easily ascertained by comparing the progress of an exostosis with that much more rapid of a periostosis, of a col- lection in the dura-mater, &c. In respect to vi- tality, however, a remarkable degree of slowness is still observed in this system ; it is particularly noticed in certain affections of the limbs in which gangrene takes place, and is, as well as the pre- vious inflammation, excessively rapid in its in- vasion, in. the cellular tissue, the muscles, &c. whilst, as I have said, the tendons that are laid bare require some time before they partake of the injury, and amidst the dark and livid aspect of the parts, are remarkable for their whiteness. The fibrous system presents a remarkable phe- nomenon in never admitting the secretion of pus. I have never heard, that subsequent to the in- flammations of this system any purulent collec- tion has been observed. Rheumatism that has been ranked with the phlegmasiae is never at- tended with such collections, a few gelatinous extravasations only have been observed round the tendons. What had been mistaken in former times for a suppuration of the dura mater in wound's of the head, was evidently a purulent transudation from the tunica arachnoides, simi- lar to that of the other membranes. What can be the reason that pus is seldom or ever formed in this system, or at least, why have these organs less ten-

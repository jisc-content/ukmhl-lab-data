G75 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. to try experiments on this organ in these two different states. A part swallowed raw by a dog, was already reduced to a pulpy state in the ani- mal stomach, when another piece cooked, and swallowed at the same time had scarcely under- gone the slightest alteration. Of the Excretory Ducts, their Origin, their Divi- sions, $c. Of the Glandular Reservoirs. All the glands are provided with tubes in- tended to expel the fluid they separate from the mass of the blood: now since these tubes are observed in glands only, they must be considered with the tissue proper to these organs. The origin of these tubes is uniform in every gland, similar to the veins they originate from, a mul- tiplicity of capillary vessels forming the last ramifications of a kind of tree. These ramus- culee seem to arise from each glandular grain wherever these grains exist; so that each grain is provided with an excretory duct, an artery and a vein. Thus originating from the whole interior of the gland, these tubes soon unite to- gether, and form larger ducts, which generally cross the gland in a straight direction, converging towards each other, and uniting with other tubes still larger, which terminate differently. In respect to this termination, glands should be divided into three classes. 1st. They transmit x x c2

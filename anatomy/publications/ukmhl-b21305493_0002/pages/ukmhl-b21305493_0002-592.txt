Their functions even command that promptitude of motion, without which they could not be per- formed. The membrane which lines the cheeks whenever the mouth is filled with air, with food, which are subsequently expelled, presents the same phenomenon. Whenever the mucous tubes cease to be supplied with their habitual fluids, they remain in a state of permanent contraction. In cases of artificial anus, I have seen the coecum and rectum reduced to the size of a very large quill. The obliteration of the parietes, however, is always prevented by the presence of the mucous fluid, a small portion of which is always emitted by the patient.

FIBROUS SYSTEM. 210 more difficulty; the gastric juices do not so readily act upon it. Spallanzani has observed,that tendons, and aponeuroses of aged animals, were harder of digestion than those of young ones. The powers of the fibrous tissue increase with age, but its softness decreases; hence the difficulty that attends mo- tions,â€”the stiffness that characterizes them. The ligaments, and the fibrous capsules, suffer the ar- ticulating surfaces to separate from each other without difficulty; tendons will hardly admit of being bent; whenever the parts wherein they are laid bare under the ligaments, are pressed, they are found to be hard, void of suppleness, &c. and it is only with difficulty, and after a long time, that they can be softened by ebullition. The whole fibrous system becomes yellow. One might suppose it then approaches that dense, con- tracted, and semi-transparent state, to which it Will be reduced by desiccation ; so that if it could be admitted that this system underwent the dif- ferent periods of its decay with more rapidity than the others do, every motion would cease, from the rigidity of the ligaments, tendons, and aponeuroses, although the power of contraction would be still preserved by the muscles.

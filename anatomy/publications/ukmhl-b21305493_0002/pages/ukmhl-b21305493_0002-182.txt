MEDULLARY SYSTEM. 140 in its bones, acquainted with this phenomenon ? This absence of medullary fat in the foetus essen- tially distinguishes marrow from that substance, which, at that age, is already found in great abundance. Functions. The first and most essential use of the medullary organ, is to separate the marrow from the mass of the blood, by means of exhalation, for this or- gan is unprovided with glands; and then to return it to this fluid by absorption, after it has remained for some time in its reservoir. This twofold pheno- menon is similar to that produced in respect to the fat: whence we perceive that two very distinct orders of blood-vessels are also admitted into its tissue; to demonstrate them, however, is not in the power of anatomy. Does the activity of exhalation vary, according to exercise or rest, heat or cold, corpulency or emaciation? Although numerous conjectures have been produced in this respect, none have been supported by strict experiment. All we know is, that in consumption, dropsy, marasmus, and in general, in all states of the body in which general debility is carried to the extreme, by the gradual and progressive fall of the vital powers, the marrow, like every other fluid, like solids also,

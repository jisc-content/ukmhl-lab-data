MUCOUS SYSTEM. 612 to what are called the papillae,â€”bodies which commonly are not very easily demonstrated. The sensibility of the mucous membranes, rather simi- lar to that of the skin, appears to me to claim the same mode of organization which here is much better perceived. The origin of the papil- lae in this system cannot be doubted, where it enters the cavities, and in the openings even of these cavities; as upon the tongue over the palate, in the internal parts of the alias nasi, over the glands, in the fossa navicularis, inside of the lips, &c., is proved by mere inspection. But the question is, whether there are also papillae in the more remote parts of this system. Analogy shows that this is the case, since sensibility is as perfect in these parts as in their origin, although it ad- mits of varieties which shall be explained, but which are not less clearly proved by inspection. I believe that the villi they are, without exception, covered wrth, are nothing but papillae. Very different ideas have been conceived of these villi. In the oesophagus and stomach, they have been considered as intended for the exhala- tion of the gastric juices, in the intestines, as the agents of the absorption of chyle, &c. But, 1st. It cannot be easily conceived how an organ, every where nearly similar, should perform in all the different parts functions so very distinct: I say nearly similar; for these bodies, as will be seen, varying in their dimensions, and without

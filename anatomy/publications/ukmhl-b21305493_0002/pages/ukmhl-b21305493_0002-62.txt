20 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. that provide the bones with forms accommodated to the adjacent organs? I should rather adopt the latter of these opinions in preference to the former, which had been thought highly probable, on account of the effect produced by aneurisms on their contiguous bones, which they gradually destroy: but let it be remarked, that if the mus- cles, the brain, the vessels, exercised over the bones in their natural state by their mode of pressure, an action analogous to that of aneurism, the state of the parts should unavoidably be the same as in that case. The compact plate would be destroyed on a level with the depressions, and leave in its place an uneven and rough surface. Now precisely the reverse takes place, which leads me to believe that what is commonly called the impressure of organs, is nothing more than a natural effect of ossification. section y. Of the Bony Cavities. These cavities are innumerable; those alone exterior to the bone, will now come under consi- deration like the eminences ; they are divided into articulating and non articulating. The former will be viewed, together with the correspond- ing eminences, in the chapter on articulations.

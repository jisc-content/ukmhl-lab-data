In all these cases; the solids of necessity must act, for all morbid phenomena nearly suppose their alterations ; but the principle of these alterations rests in the fluids. Fluids are the exciting agents, solids the excited organs; now, if there is no exciting cause, the solids must necessarily remain perfectly calm. To conclude, there are cases in which the whole economy appears simultaneously affected, both in its solids and in its fluids: such are adynamic fevers, in which, whilst general prostration in- vades the former, the latter actually appear to be decomposed. Let us not then exaggerate medical theories; let us see nature in diseases as it is in the state of health, wherein the solids elaborate the fluids, and at the same time are stimulated by them. It is a reciprocal exchange of action, in which every thing comes in turn, and is connected together. Nature rarely admits of our abstract opinions ; in physic we generally adopt a certain number of principles, and then we accustom ourselves to de- duce from these principles, as an indispensable consequence, every explanation of disease. In the phenomena of physics there is a continued regu- larity and uniformity ; even in morals, there are a certain number of principles acknowledged by every man, by which they are directed, and their actions regulated ; hence the invariable uniformity

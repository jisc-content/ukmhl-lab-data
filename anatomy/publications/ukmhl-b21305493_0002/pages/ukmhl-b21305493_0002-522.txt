MUSCULAR SYSTEM 480 heart than in the other muscles of the same class. We have noticed two very distinct periods in the developement of these muscles; the one is completed with their growth, the other when the increase in thickness has ceased. The term of the former in organic life is not quite so strictly marked. Stature has already ceased, when the gastric and urinary organs of the heart still lengthen and expand. Growth has been considered in too general a light. In this important phenomenon each sys- tem has its peculiar time. The osseous system, the muscular system of animal life, and those de- pending upon them as the fibrous, the cartilagi- nous, &c. especially influence the general stature of the subject; but this never influences the length of the intestines, the capacity of the stomach, of the heart, of the bladder, &c.; the glandular? serous, mucous systems, &c. are also independent of stature: thus do its innumerable varieties re- late much more to the limbs than to the abdo- men, and the chest, &c. A lofty stature proclaims a predominance in the powers of locomotion, but not in those of digestion, respiration, &c. The cessation of growth in stature is merely referable to the muscles, the bones, and their appendages, and not to the internal viscera which still ex- pand. We might easily be convinced of this, by comparing the organic muscles of a youth of eighteen with those of a man of thirty and forty.

283 OF ANIMAL LIFE. that has undergone desiccation in the ordinary way, although the aspect is quite different. Submitted to the action of water, the muscles display different phenomena, according to its temperature. Cold water first deprives it of its reddish hue, the principal of which it seems to dissolve. To produce this phenomenon rapidly, the flesh should be exposed in thin layers to the action of water frequently renewed ; by placing it, for instance, under the cock of a fountain, the stream of a river, or what is preferable, by re- peatedly draining it by pressing out the water with which it is permeated, for if it be kept in a jug, it will become white externally, but re- tain its colour within. The water used to wash a muscle is red, and appears as if blood had been mixed with this fluid ; it contains the colouring substance, and a small quantity of extractive matter, some gelatine, &c. Of all the organs, the muscle, I believe, is most readily deprived of its colour by artificial means. Ought we then to be surprized if nature so frequently and so evidently causes this hue to vary in the phenomena of nu- trition, as we shall soon have occasion to remark. Preserved in water of a moderate temperature, the muscular tissue is a long time in softening; eventually, however, it softens, and is succes- sively, layer by layer, converted into a kind of putrelage, very distinct, however, from that pro- duced in the open air, as I have frequently had

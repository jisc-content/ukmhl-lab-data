It is in slow and chronic affections then, that instances of sympathies in the systems of bones and cartilages, &e. should be sought for. In the early periods of the invasion of the venereal dis- ease, when it appears with acute symptoms, at least when its progress is not very slow, as in buboes, inflammation of the urethra, &c. its in- fluence does not re-act upon the system of the bones, it is only after it has continued some time, after it has degenerated as it were, and assumed chronic type, that bones are affected by the dis- ease, and become the seat of pain, of different tumours, &c.; besides, I am not aware that the sympathies of the bones have been properly ana- lyzed.

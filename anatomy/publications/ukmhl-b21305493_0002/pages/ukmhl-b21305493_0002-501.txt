459 OF ORGANIC LIFE. all the organic muscles, the least affected by the influence radiating from the diseased organ ; but it is sometimes disordered. We are aware that in fevers, the retentions of urine from sympathe- tic and temporary paralysis are not very scarce ; incontinence of urine is not so common. Character of the Vital Properties. From what we have said, it is obvious, that the vital properties are very active in organic muscles, particularly in what relates to contractility. These muscles during life are actually in a permanent state of activity : they are readily influenced by the other organs. Their vital properties, parti- cularly those I have just mentioned, are altered with the utmost promptitude, for insensible con- tractility is seldom affected, because in those organs it does not take a very essential part. In fact the morbid derangements of an organ con- stantly bear upon the vital power which predo- minates in that organ. Animal contractility is frequently affected in the preceding system ; in thi$ it is sensible organic contractility. The in- sensible contractility or tone, on the contrary, be- ing less so, the phenomena over which it presides almost invariably remain the same : nutrition is uniformly continued ; the structural diseases of muscles are scarce ; when they occur, it is more frequently from communication, as in cancer

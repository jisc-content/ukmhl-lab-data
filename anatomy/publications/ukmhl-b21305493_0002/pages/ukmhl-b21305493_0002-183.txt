I have only observed this change in rick- ets ; the marrow in such diseases bears a mu- cilaginous, a gelatinous aspect, as that we ob- serve in the foetus, admitting of this distinction only, of the reddish hue caused in the early stage by the great number of blood vessels. The medullary membrane has a direct connexion with the nutrition of the bone, a connexion per- fectly elucidated by the beautiful experiments of Troja, from which it follows, that the destruction of this membrane causes the death of the bone, which is replaced by a new one, the periosteum acting in respect to the latter as a nutritive parenchyma. These experiments are generally tried, by sawing the head of a long bone, and by introducing into the medullary tube a red hot iron, that disorganizes every thing. Soon after the periosteum swells, becomes inflamed, and excessively sensible to the touch. This gra- dually becomes less, and inflammation subsides. A considerable quantity of gelatine permeates the internal lamellae of this membrane, which forms into a cartilaginous bag, with which the bone is envelop- ed. After a certain time that varies according to the class to which the animal submitted to the experi- ment belongs ; according also to its age, constitu-

38 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. effect to that of the first degree of combustion, although, however, it is seldom in this case com- pletely deprived of its gelatinous parts, and the saline so effectually laid bare, as by the action of caloric ; besides, to produce this effect, a consi- derable time is required, particularly with the thick bones, the thin bones require less. In an observation I have repeatedly made, I remarked that clavicles which had remained in the ceme- tery of Clamart for ten years exposed to air and rain, presented, when submitted to the action of acids, a cartilaginous parenchyma nearly equal to that of a bone that had undergone desiccation for some time. But finally, this parenchyma decays, and the bone no longer supported, moulders into dust, when, in the course of time, the particles of the remaining calcareous substance have been dis- united. 3d. In every cancerous disease that has attained its last period, the bones acquire a degree of brittleness proceeding only from a greater proportion of the latter substance, a proportion that itself proceeds from but little gelatine being then exhaled in the bones; 4t.h. When a bone has been for some time submitted to the action of an acid, of the nitric for instance, it is robbed of a part of its substance by that acid, and that part is evidently a calcareous salt, as is seen by mixing an alkali with the dissolution, which instantly, uniting with the acid, discovers that salt in a pre- cipitated sediment; 5th, Papineâ€™s machine also,

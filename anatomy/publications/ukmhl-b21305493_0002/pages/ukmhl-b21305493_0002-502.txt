MUSCULAR SYSTEM 460 of the stomach, where the disease begins over the mucous surface, and where the fleshy fibres are only consecutively affected: the heart and the womb are the most liable to these morbid altera- tions ; and yet in the former they more frequently belong to the internal membrane than to the fleshy fibres. In those systems, on the contrary, in which sensible organic contractility is incessantly in action, as in the cutaneous, the serous, &c. where it presides over nutrition and exhalation; in the glandular, the mucous, &c. where it pro- duces both secretion and nutrition, &c. it is par- ticularly affected. From these derangements arise the alterations of the tissue, the organic diseases properly so called, as common in these systems, as they are rare in those in which insensible con- tractility, very obscure, exists in such a degree onlyTts may be indispensable for nutrition. To this also must be referred the rarity of acute inflammations in this system. This affection is as common in the cutaneous, serous, mucous sys- tems, &c. as it is rare in this wherein the natural functions require but little tone. Those who at- tend dissections are conscious the tissue of the heart is hardly ever found inflamed. Nothing is more common than inflammations of the external or serous membranes, or of the mucous and in- ternal membrane of the stomach, the intestines, &c., but nothing more obscure or more seldom observed than that of their fleshy tunic.

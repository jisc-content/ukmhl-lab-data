OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 72 organ: but these articulations differ; 1st. Inas- much as they have several prominences and cavi- ties that are inserted into each other, a disposition which, by limiting the motion to one direction only, prevents it in every other. In general there are two kinds of semi-spherical projections? called condyles, that move from before back- wards, or from within outwards, &c. on two simi- lar cavities, and that are divided by a projection which is inserted in the interstice between the condyles, as is proved in the femoro-tibial articulations, in those of the phalanges, &c.; 2dly. This genus is also distinguished from the preceding, by the width of the surfaces: this width secures its solidity, and prevents luxations, which, however, are attended with more dreadful consequences in these parts, as a greater number of ligaments must necessarily be torn. In this genus, motion is always more extended in one direction, than in that which is opposite. In general, flexion is never so limited as exten- sion : in fact, if we consider the condyles of the femur, of the phalanges, &c., they are much less extensive in the one than in the other direction; Why is this ? because all our essential motions require flexion, and those of extension are only intended to enable the former, as it were, to re- store the limb to a position from which it may proceed to be again bent. This explains why the numbers and the powers of the fibres are

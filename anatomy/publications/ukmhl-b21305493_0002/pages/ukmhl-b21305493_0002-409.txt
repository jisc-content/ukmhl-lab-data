I consider all these mo- tions as nearly similar to the act of leaping, dif- fering from this act only in the effects they pro- duce, It may be noticed that authors have not sufficiently assimilated all these variously rapid and abrupt contractions, for the act of leaping has been viewed in too abstract a manner : but let us return to our subject. The rapidity of muscular contractions, is powerfully subordinate to practice. The habit of exercising certain muscles, gives us more facility in contracting them ; for instance, the habit of walking, which exercises alternately the flexors and extensors, enables us to run with great rapidity. If any one will habituate himself to this last exercise, he will very soon attain the utmost degree of rapidity of which his muscular system will admit. The motions of adduction and abduction, on the contrary, being more rarely performed in the ordinary state, require in dan cers a considerable and long continued practice to enable them to perform with agility those steps in which the legs cross each other alternately. Habit in general has much greater influence on the rapidity than the degree of contraction ; by practice, any one may leap or run with more or less agility.

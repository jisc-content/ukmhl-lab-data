To bend the thigh in a corpse often requires considerable exertion ; but sometimes the slightest attempt is sufficient, as in cases of asphyxia from charcoal. These states of rigidity or relaxation are innume- rable in their degrees. The first is sometimes car- ried so far, that the subject, on being placed against the wall will remain in a vertical direc- tion, on other occasions this cannot possibly be effected. In some subjects, one division of the muscular system is stiff, another is slack. It ap- pears that these different states depend upon the nature of the death, upon the phenomena that accompany the last respirations. How these phe- nomena are produced would be a very inte- resting subject of research. I have remarked that the muscles which remain stiff at the instant of death, are easily lacerated, if ever so slight an effort be made to bend the limbs to which they resort; that the contrary is the case with those which continue supple, whatever may be the de- gree of force directed to their moveable points; to produce this phenomenon, which is then easily effected, they should be drawn in a straight direction, or weights should be suspended to them. The muscular tissue, as is the case with the bony, the cartilaginous, and even with the fibrous, is never accidentally developed in parts

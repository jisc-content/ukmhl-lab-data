OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 34 two parts of bone, their mode of resistance must also be equally opposite. Viewed in the medullary canal, or in the ends, the cancelli are somewhat different. In the tube it consists of very small filaments, continued with thicker fibres that fill up both ends of the bone, and with the compact part that forms the bony cylinder, very scarce and disseminated as it were accidentally in the middle of the canal, these filaments approach nearer together, and form a kind of net-work, as they recede from the centre ; hence the denomination of reticulated substances. This, however, is not a distinct tissue, it is no more than a modification in the cancelli, a modifica- tion especially characterized ; 1st, By the tenuity of the fibres; 2d, By being deficient of those short and delicate lamellae that are frequently developed in that tissue when viewed in the other parts. Besides, the evident use of this portion of cancelli, too weak to contribute to the resistance of the bone, is evidently to afford a support for the medullary system, and a means of origin to its membrane. The fibres of the cancelli gradu- ally increase in thickness in the ends of the long bones, they approximate more, are strewed with lamellae, and by their number and union, give to the bone a remarkable thickness and power of resistance, without, however, increasing the weight, a circumstance favourable to locomotion,

MUC0U8 SYSTEM. 496 folds of the stomach so much talked of can sel- dom be traced, because generally the subject has died from some affection, which has so far weakened his vital powers, as to prevent all kind of action in that organ ; so that, although frequently found empty, its fibres are not at all contracted. In experiments on living animals on the contrary, these folds are made very strik- ing, by adopting the following method:â€”In- stantly a dog has taken a copious quantity of food and drink, open the animal, and cut into the stomach in the direction of its longest curve : no folds are then to be seen : but the viscus soon contracts ; the edges fall backwards ; the food is thrown out; the whole mucous surface is co- vered with a multiplicity of irregular promi- nences and wrinkles not unlike the convolutions of the brain. The same result might be obtained by tearing away the stomach from an animal re- cently killed, inflating and then dividing it, or rather by dividing it immediately when empty, and drawing it out by its edges ; it extends, the wrinkles disappear, and if the distension be dis- continued, they are instantly produced in a very conspicuous manner. With regard to inflating the stomach, I have observed, that by distending it with oxygen, stronger wrinkles, and conse- quently more powerful contractions are not ob- tained by the contact of this gas, than by em- ploying the carbonic acid gas for the same pur-

OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 36 almost exclusively the compact tissue; in the flat, partly this and partly the cellular tissue, or cancelli, that constitute solidity ; in the ends of long bones, and in the short ones, it is almost ex- clusively to the latter tissue that this property is owing. 4th. In the eminences of the bones, the com- pact tissue is in general more abundant than in other parts, particularly in those of insertion, as in the projecting lines of long bones that entirely formed with it, in the asperities of bony surfaces, and in their angles. If the emi- nence be considerable, more or less cancelli con- tribute to the formation, as is seen in the spinal, the transverse, vertebral, coracoid, mastoid, apo- physes, &c. The eminences for the moveable articulations are in general more sparingly sup- plied with compact tissue, the articulating cartilage being a substitute to it, for the solidity of the bone : on the contrary, those of the immoveable articulations being in general smaller, such for instance; as the indentations of the bones of the skull, &c. are proportionally more compact than cellular. 5th. In the cavities of the bones, every one of those that are intended for moveable articulations, are provided with a very thin compact layer only : with a thicker whenever the articulations are characterized by want of motion. In general every aperture, cavity, or tube, that transmits

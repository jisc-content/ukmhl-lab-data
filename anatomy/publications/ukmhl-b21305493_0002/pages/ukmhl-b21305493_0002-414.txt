MUSCULAR SYSTEM 372 most judicious authors have been misled in this respect. Two modes of contraction are frequently com- bined : for instance ; when a muscle is divided on a living subject, first a slow general contrac- tion, produced by the contractility of tissue, will be observed, then partial oscillations in every di- vided fibre Now these oscillations have nothing to do with the retraction, which would take place without them, frequently in the living subject, and always in the corpse. In the same manner these oscillations may be combined with the sud- den contractions arising from the nervous influence produced by the action of the will, such as hap- pen in the last moments of our existence, or may not be conilected with them, as is generally the case when the animal enjoys life in all its pleni- tude. This last fact may be easily ascertained without the help of experiments, by applying the hand to the masseter muscle, or to the biceps of an emaciated subject; whilst they contract, not the slightest motion resembling oscillation will be felt under the skin. section v. Motions produced by the Muscles. Every muscular motion is either a simple motion or a combined one. Let us now inves-

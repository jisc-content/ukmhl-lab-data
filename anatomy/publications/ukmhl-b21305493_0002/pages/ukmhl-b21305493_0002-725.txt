The animals were rather more sick, but none died, ex- cepting one seven days after the experiment. On account of that I had tried three years ago, I have repeatedly renewed this; it was constantly attended with the same result, which led me to believe that, not very skilful then in experiments, I had probably admitted a bubble of air into the syringe, which most likely caused the animal’s death. The question, then, is obviously resolved by experience. Secreted fluids, though intended to be outwardly expelled in the natural state, may be returned into the circulating tide, without causing the animal’s death; the only conse- quence being more or less general disorder, ac- cording to the nature of the fluid injected. Hence, whether bile be circulated or not circu- lated with the blood, in bilious fevers, is a question I shall not examine; but most undoubtedly it may circulate with it, after having been absorbed in its ducts. I have not the least doubt that, in cases of purulent absorptions, pure pus may be circulated in the vascular system. I confess I have tried no experiment respecting the injection of this fluid, but intend to do so very soon. It is in our very nature to exaggerate every thing; undoubtedly the solids, in which the vital

904 EPIDERMOID A L SYSTEM. Wherever the epidermis of the mucous surfaces has been destroyed, it has been rapidly regene- rated. Not possessing either organic or animal sensibility, it is in this respect calculated, as well as in the skin, to protect the subjacent papillae, which are endowed with remarkable sensibility. â€¢/ To its presence also, over the mucous surfaces, must be attributed the faculty they are gifted with, of being exposed to the air, and even to the contact of exterior forms, without exfoliating or inflaming, as in the unnatural anus, prolapsus of the rectum, &c., whilst the serous surfaces will never bear these contacts with impunity. Besides, the nature of the mucous epidermis is similar to the cutaneous : submitted to the action of the same agents, they give the same results. The excrescences which form upon its surface, are per- fectly similar, though not so common; it becomes callous from pressure. Chopart quotes the in- stance of a shepherd in whom the urethra pre- sented this disposition from repeatedly introducing a small rod, for the purpose of indulging his vene- real appetite. The density which this envelope- ment acquires in the stomachs of certain birds, is well known ; in particular instances, where the mucous membranes are forced out, aftd in prolap- sus of the anus, vagina, uterus, &c.: sometimes even then, from the pressure of the dress, this membrane becomes evidently thicker than in its natural state. This is even partly the reason that

MUCOUS SYSTEM. 488 ARTICLE I. Di visions and Forms of the Mucous System. The mucous membranes line the interior of the cavities that communicate with the skin through the different apertures which this envelope pre- sents on the surface of the body. These, at the first view, appear very considerable; for the organs within from which they are reflected, are very numerous. The mouth, the stomach, the intestines, the oesophagus, the bladder, the ure- thra, the uterus, the ureters, all the excretory ducts, <fcc. &c. partly borrow their structure from these membranes. If we consider, however, that they are every where continuous, that they are always seen arising from and connected with each other at their origin from the skin, we shall find that their number is remarkably li- mited. In fact, considering them in this manner, and not individually, but including in a same glance all those parts in which they are conti- nued, we find them confined to two general sur- faces, of which the others form divisions, and which, in respect to the different parts to which they are distributed, we may designate the gas- tro-pulmonary and the genito-urinary. The former belongs to the head, neck, and the abdo- men, the latter to the urinary bladder, and more particularly to the pelvis.

muscular system 314 of motion, must be referred all the phenomena produced by the different modes of decapitation. Ducks, geese, and other species of the feathered tribe, still move their voluntary muscles with some degree of regularity, after the head has been severed from the body, in running, jumping, and performing other motions, &c. Some time alter the fall of the guillotine, the upper and lower extremities still continue to quiver, and the muscles of the face, even by their contractions, have expressed different passions; expressions er- roneously referred to a surviving sensitive princi- ple in the brain. Similar phenomena were ob- served in that punishment formerly employed of beheading with the axe. Some time since I made a painful experiment of these singular facts: a guinea-pig, from which I had just ex- tracted the heart, thrust the four projecting teeth, by which this specie is distinguished, through one of my fingers. All these phenomena are merely the result of the irritation produced either by the instrument, or by the effect of air on the two surfaces of the division of the marrow. This is so perfectly correct, that, by increasing the irritation with a pointed or cutting instrument, &c. by a chemical agent applied to these extremi- ties, the motions will be considerably increased. This fact is easily ascertained on a living animal. I have frequently verified it on criminals who had suffered the guillotine, and on which subjects I

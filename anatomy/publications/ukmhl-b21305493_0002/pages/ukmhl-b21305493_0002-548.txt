/ 606 MUCOUS SYSTEM. the mucous surfaces near to the openings of the skin, especially over the tongue, the palate, and the internal surface of the cheeks. Exposed to the action of dry air, so that it may be penetrated on all sides, the mucous corion dries, grows very thin, but retains some degree , of resistance. When the bladder is dried and in- flated, or the stomach, intestines, &c. have un- dergone a similar preparation, it is this tissue that prevents the organs from sinking, although air has been suffered to escape ; from its resistance, even on attempting to bend it in different ways, a crackling noise is produced; to ascertain this, let the mucous surface be dried separately from the serous and muscular layers that correspond to it; these, when dried, will remain supple as well as the cellular tissue, whilst the former will retain a kind of rigidity. In organs of which the mucous tissue is rather pale, as the bladder, the rectum, &c. this tissue becomes transparent on drying ; when of a deep red, as in the stomach, if a considerable quantity of blood has been accumulating by preceding inflammation, it assumes a deep colour, even blackish, as it were ; whence it appears that this fluid is the source of colour. Thus dried, the mucous surfaces are smooth ; they appear to have lost their viscidity ; their folds sink into the parts from which they origi- nate : thus, on a dried intestine, the valvulae con-

523 MUCOUS SYSTEM. not directly affect the gland, have such an amaz- ing influence upon it? For, as has already been stated, these glands are constantly subjacent to the membrane, and consequently separated by it from the irritating agent. This seems to form a general modification of the glandular sen- sibility, which admits of being forced into action, as will be proved when treating of the glandular system, by every thing that acts upon the extre- mities of the excretory tubes. To the readiness with which the mucous glands answer the irritation of the extremity of their tubes, must be referred the artificial catarrhs, Vauquelin has been affected with, by breathing emanations arising from oxygenated muriatic acid, the mucous discharge attendant upon a polypus, or any tumour in the vagina, a stone in the bladder, &c.; the repeated white discharge in females, from the too frequent indulgence of the sexual appetite, the more abundant flow of mucous from the nose in persons who take an immoderate quantity of snuff, &c.: in all such cases thereis evidently an excitement of the mucous tubes.

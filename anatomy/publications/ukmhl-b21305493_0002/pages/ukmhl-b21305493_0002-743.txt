701 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. unsupported by facts. I have drawn blood from the carotid, spermatic, hepatic, renal arteries, <fcc.: it was red, bright, and coagulable. In the same animal, the slightest distinction cannot pos- sibly be discovered. I have observed that secretion essentially dif- fers from nutrition, in as much as it constantly borrows the materials of its fluids from the red blood, whilst the other frequently selects its own from the white fluids, as is seen in respect to the tendons, cartilages, hair, &c. Nerves. The glands are supplied with two species of nerves. 1st. The cerebral nerves are almost ex- clusively met with, in the salivary and lachrymal glands, the tonsils, &c. 2dly. The testes, the prostate, the liver, receive nearly an equal pro- portion from the brain and from the ganglions. 3dly. The kidneys and the greater part of the mucous glands are hardly supplied by any but those of the ganglia. This observation upon the nerves is referable only to such as are free and do not depend upon the arteries; for, each arte- rial trunk, on penetrating a gland, is surrounded with a nevous plexus belonging to the system of the ganglia, and strongly characterised in the large glands, as in the liver and kidneys, which are supplied with one from the semi-lunar gan-

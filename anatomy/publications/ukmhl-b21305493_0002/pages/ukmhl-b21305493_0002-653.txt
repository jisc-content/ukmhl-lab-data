611 SEROUS SYSTEM, so much ; not to be noticed in each, &c. ? The pericardium is liable to an affection I have observed in no other serous membrane ; it consists of white lamellae, more or less ex- tended, and forming over the internal surface, which on a first glance might bethought inherent in their tissue, but which may however be re- moved without injuring it. I am ignorant how these lamellae are produced : do they correspond to those of the false membranes of the pleura ? Neither should we be surprised at what has been said respecting the varieties observed in diseases. The whole of the peritoneum is frequently dis- eased, and the spleen remains healthy, &c. The lamellae I have just been speaking of are only seen upon the free surface of the pericardium, &c. Let it be remarked, however, that every dis- ease of this system bears a common character, evidently derived from analogy of organization. This system and the synovial, are the only ones in which rather considerable serous collections form, and in which slow and tubercular inflammations are produced. To this exclusively belongs the major part of its peculiar modes of adhesion. In- flammation has a peculiar and distinctive character in all the serous surfaces. That of the meninges, from analogy of symptoms was ranked amongst the serous phlegmasiee long before I had demonstrated that the tunica arachnoides essentially belonged to the serous system. It is to this membrane, and not R R 2

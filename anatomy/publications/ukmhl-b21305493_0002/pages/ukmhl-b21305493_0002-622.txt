580 i SEROUS SYSTEM. with the mucous : such are the stomach, the intes- tines, the bladder, the lungs, &c. It is found round every one of such as are essential to life, as the brain, the heart, all the gastric viscera, the testes, the bladder, &c. This does not, like the mucous system, form a surface every where continuous over the nume- rous organs it envelopes, but is constantly found isolated in its divers divisions, which have hardly ever any communication together, and the number of these divisions is rather considerable. By in- cluding in one view the different serous surfaces the entire mass is seen to exceed that of the mu- cous surfaces. One single consideration will con- vince us of this: the mucous and serous surfaces attend each other in many parts, as in the sto- mach, the intestines, the lungs, the bladder, the gall bladder, &c. so as to prove nearly of the same extent. But on the one hand, the mucous surfaces reach where the others do not, as in the fossae nasales, the oesophagus, the mouth, &c.; on the other hand, there are a considerable number of serous surfaces existing separately from the mucous, as the pericardium, the tunica arachnoides, &c. Now if the extent of these isolated serous surfaces be compared with that of the mucous surfaces, the one will be found to exceed the other very considerably. These considerations, which might appear trifling, claim however a special attention, on ac-

748 dermoidal system* other small wrinkles, corresponding to less fre- quent and less considerable motions, intersect them in divers angles. On the back of the hand and foot a number of wrinkles are observed on a level with all the articulations of the phalanges when they are extended. They disappear in flexion, and depend upon the looseness of the skin in this part, intended by nature to accommodate motion. Similar folds are observed over the greatest number of the articulations, but they are less striking, because the skin is not quite so firmly attached to the adjacent parts. Over the whole trunk, arm, forearms, thighs, and legs, no other depressions are seen, but such as correspond to the muscular projections, &c. 3dly. There is a third species of wrinkles, or rather of cutaneous impressions, but which are not very obvious: they are met with particularly in the sole of the foot and in the palm of the hand, and are very distinct from the preceding; I mean those which trace the papillae; scarcely any thing similar is met with in the trunk. 4thly. There are wrinkles belonging to age which are quite of a different nature. The sub- cutaneous fat having partly disappeared, the skin is left too wide for the parts it has to cover ; now as it has been deprived by age of its contractility of tissue, it will no longer contract, but wrinkles in various ways. Thus, in such parts as are more

dekmoidal system. 863 the skin, renders it impossible^ form any correct inference respecting its natural proportion. The nerves, as in every other part, are more conspi- cuous; but the papillae, although, as I have al- ready stated, not equally developed. There is no animal sensibility in the skin of the foetus, or if existing, it is excessively obscure. This proceeds from a want of excitement. The surrounding heat is considerable; the liquor amnii, and the parietes of the womb, may in fact give rise to sensations, but as these causes are invariably the same, as they admit of no varieties, the foetus can only have but very faint and imperfect sensations, because a quickness in sensations indispensably requires a renewal of stimulants. It is well known that when heat is applied for a length of time it is not perceptible ; that the sensation resulting from water is almost completely lost by remaining long in the bath., Why ? Because it is in the very nature of habit to deaden sensation, and we are only forcibly acted upon by what is new. Is organic sensibility active in the foetus? Does it produce an alternate exhalation and ab- sorption of the liquor amnii; this is not an opinion generally received, nor even do I believe it probable ; but this question is very far indeed from being as accurately determined as many â€¢ other points of physiology. However, it cannot be doubted that there is an

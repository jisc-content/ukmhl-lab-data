56 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. its mode of vitality, has been properly investi- gated. Seat of the Vital Properties. Impregnated wifh saline substance incessantly tending to obey the laws of affinity and attraction, and to give to these laws a predominance over those of sensibility and organic motion, the bones appear to form the intermediate link between living and inert bodies. There is but one part of their bony tissue that partakes of the vital phe- nomena, namely, their cartilaginous substance; the other part, or the calcareous substance, has no connection with it. Thus the degree of vitality in bones, is in proportion to the quantity of these substances. During infancy when the former predominates, and in the early periods of the formation of callus, when it is exclusively met with, in the softening of bones, in which case it exists almost separately, all the vital phenomena become more striking, more energetic. On the contrary, as the saline substance is gradually ac- cumulated in the bones by age, or in proportion as in peculiar species of animals, this accumu- lation takes place in consequence of the natural laws of ossification in respect to peculiar external parts of the system that have a calcareous basis, as the horns of the stag, the crustaceous cover- ings, &c. life is, as it were, progressively de-

MUSCULAR SYSTEM 348 the nature of the stimulants, and causes a variety in the intensity of contractions. Dust of wood, coal, metal, &c. strewed over the muscles of a frog, will only produce slight motions; let a pulverized neutral salt, sea-salt for instance, be applied, and instantly irregular agitations, a thou- sand different oscillations are produced. All bodies are, by their nature, capable of acting dif- ferently upon the muscles, as according to age, constitutions, seasons, climate, &c. the muscles are susceptible of being affected. To cause a muscle to contract, it is not re- quisite that the whole should be excited; two or three fibres only are sufficient to put all the others in motion. Frequently, even when these experiments are tried on a living animal, the contraction is extended from one muscle to the other. In general, I have remarked that during life these experiments are attended with more dif- ficulty, and give more variable results in what, as I have previously stated, regards animal contrac- tility. If a muscle be laid bare and excited at in- tervals ; at one time, it will not give the slightest appearance of contractility; at another time it will be strongly contracted, and this variation takes place from one instant to the other; whilst, if an animal recently killed, be selected for the experiment, the results, within a certain time, are always nearly the same, admitting of this dis- tinction only, that the contractions are less in

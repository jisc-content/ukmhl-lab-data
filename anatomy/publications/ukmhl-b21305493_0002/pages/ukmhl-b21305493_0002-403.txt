361 OF ANIMAL LIFE. of females will much exceed in energy those of the most powerful man considered in the natural state. The power of the muscular contraction then depends upon the strength of the organization in the tissue of the muscles, and of the degree of cerebral excitement; if both happen to be weak, there will hardly be any motion at all; if both exist in the highest degree, it will be difficult to conceive the consequences that may result:â€”a maniac, whose muscles are thick and powerful, is capable of exertions that will baffle all calcu- lations ; but when the nervous power is very energetic, and the muscular tissue weak, or when the case is the reverse, the phenomena are less. Nature has in general united these properties in the latter state. Women and children, characte- rized by the debility of the fleshy tissue, are very sensitive ; men, on the contrary, particularly those distinguished by athletic forms, are less easily affected, and those causes which act powerfully upon the muscular system, are consequently less numerous. In whatever point of view we consider the powers of contraction in the muscular system of animal life, it is very considerable in proportion to the effects that result from these contractions. In the animal economy nature follows a law, the re- verse of that which governs the motions of our me- chanical machines,the essential advantage of which

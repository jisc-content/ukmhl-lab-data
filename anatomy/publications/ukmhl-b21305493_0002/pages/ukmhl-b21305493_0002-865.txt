DJi RMOIDAL SYSTEM. 823 restored to their original dimensions. The various tumours, collections of matter, and external aneurisms, the sudden swellings attending con- siderable contusions, serous collections, pregnancy, schirrus, the numerous affections in which the volume of the testis is increased, hydrocele, &c., also proclaim these properties. In all such cases, the skin is seen, first, to extend and dilate, then to contract whenever the cause of dilatation has ceased, and finally, is restricted to the space originally allotted to it. From the contractility of tissue proceeds that remarkable separation observed in the edges of a wound from a cutting instrument. This phe- nomenon, which is also observable in the corpse, is a further proof of what has been often re- marked, namely, that the properties of the tissue exclusively belonging to the organic texture, are unconnected with the vital powers, from which they merely borrow additional energy. Thus, cutaneous retraction is found more effectual du- ring life, in a wound inflicted in either a longitu- dinal or transvere direction: but this increase of contractility borrowed from the vital powers, is particularly striking in amputation. No part whatever, not even the muscles, will ever contract as much as the skin, hence the care so strongly recommended in practice, to spare as much as possible on performing amputation ; hence also, the important additional modifications that have

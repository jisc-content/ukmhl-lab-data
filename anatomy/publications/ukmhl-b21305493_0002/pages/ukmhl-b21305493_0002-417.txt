By this general rule, it is only sufficient to see a muscle in the corpse to decide for what uses it was intended. Whenever the whole of a wide muscle is con- centrated in one common point, such as the del- toid, which arising above by a multiplicity of parts, is inserted below by a single tendon, the average direction of all its fibres should be chosen to ap- preciate its uses. When a muscle is attached by several points at its two extremities, consequently, when the fibres it is composed of, form different skains of diffe- rent directions and separate motions, the line of direction of each bundle should be examined to judge of the action of the muscle. It is in this manner that we should study those of the trape- zius, of the serratus major, the rhomboideus, &c. In muscles that are reflected, as the great ob- lique of the eye, the peronei, the staphylinus ex- ternus, &c., the action of the muscle should be cal- culated from the point of reflexion only : thus the great oblique moves the eye inwards, notwith- standing that its fleshy portion contracts in such a manner as to carry the moveable point back- wards. The orbiculares, those situate round the lips, the eyes, the arms, &c. have in general no fixed or moveable poirfi ; they are not intended to bring

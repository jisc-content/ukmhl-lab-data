MUSCULAR SYSTEM 382 in the beginning as deep as in the adult, it even remains such until birth ; if the bones be selected for comparison, this becomes striking. In the adult, the interior of the bones is not as red as the muscular tissue; the difference is very remarkable ; in the foetus it is quite the reverse; the parts of the bones already ossified, are impregnated with a greater quantity of blood than the interior of the muscles. In the two dis- tant periods of life nature has distributed this \ fluid for the two systems in quite a reverse order. This phenomenon I conceive essentially de- pends upon the activity of the muscles previous to birth. It may be remarked, in fact, that al- though during the last months of pregnancy, some motions denote the presence of the foetus in the womb, yet these motions, however, are not so striking as afterwards. The proofs are, in the permanent position, assumed by the limbs and the trunk, half bent, in the narrow space allowed for motions particularly in the latter period of pregnancy, when the quantity of the fluid is very considerably diminished. Although during the / early months the space be more extensive, yet on opening the bodies of pregnant animals, the foetus is constantly found coiled on itself, and in a state of immobility as it were. Several eminent physiologists have found the muscles of the chick less irritable when in the shell than after it is hatched, either under the influ-

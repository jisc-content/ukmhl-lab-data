21 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. Amongst the latter there are cavities; 1st. Of insertion; 2d. Of reception; 3d. Of gliding; 'ith. Of impression ; 5th. Of transmission ; 6th. Of nutrition. 1st. Aponeuroses, muscles, and ligaments, &c. are implanted in the cavities of insertion. They serve, 1st, To multiply fibrous origins with- out an increase of diameter in the bone, since a concave surface evidently presents more ex- tent than a flat one bounded by the same line : 2d. To leave more space for the muscular fibres, and to render them consequently longer than if they arose from a projection, by which means they admit of more extensive motion. The pterygoid and digastric cavities, &c. may be pro- duced as instances. 2d. The cavities of reception are those which are intended to receive an organ to harbour and protect it. Such are the sockets of the bones of the skull, those of the ilium, &c. These cavities sometimes belong to the whole of the bone whose form is concave, as is seen in parietal bones; at other times they are formed in an insulated part, as the maxillary depression of the inferior jaw ; but they are always intended for some essential part, for a gland, a viscus, &c. 3d. The cavities of gliding are generally found in the heads of the long bones : they are furrows, more or less deep, in which the tendons slide to proceed to the intended point of insertion. They

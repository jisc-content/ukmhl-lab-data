State of this System in very early Life. In the foetus all the serous surfaces are exces- sively thin. On opening the chest by a longitu- dinal section of the sternum, and examining the pleura of the mediastinum, where it is free on both sides, it is found thinner than the transpa- rent sheet of the omentum or of the tunica arach- noides in the adult. The peritoneum is rather thicker, but its tenuity is still very striking. As to the omentum and the tunica arachnoides, a correct idea of the excessive tenuity of their tissue will hardly be conveyed by comparing them with that of the bubble, formed with soap and water. At this period, the fluid by which the serous membranes are lubricated, is much more unctuous and viscid than at the subsequent stages; by passing the fingers over these surfaces at different ages, the distinction will be easily felt. One might almost think that the tactile qualities of

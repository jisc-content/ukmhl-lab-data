FIBROUS SYSTEM. 198 by observation ; but if the fibrous organs be ex- posed to a sudden and violent extension, their animal sensibility will be developed to the utmost. This fact is particularly remarkable in the liga- ments, the fibrous capsules, the aponeuroses, &c. Lay bare an articulation in a dog, that of the leg, for instance : dissect away carefully the sur- rounding organs, particularly the nerves, so as to leave the ligaments only, and let these be irritated by a mechanical or chemical agent: the animal will not move, or give signs of pain : then distend these ligaments by twist- ing the articulation ; the animal will instantly struggle, be convulsed, and express its agonies by cries, &c.; finally, let these ligaments be di- vided, so as to leave the synovial membrane only, which here is situate in the fibrous capsule, and let these two bones be twisted in reverse directions ; there is no longer any pain. Aponeuroses, and even tendons laid bare, and drawn in contrary directions, display the same phenomenon. I have repeatedly tried these experiments, which prove what I have stated indisputably; namely, that ordinary means are not sufficient to bring the ani- mal sensibility of the fibrous system into play, and that this faculty is strongly characterized in the distensions to which this system is liable. Let it be remarked, that this mode of being excited, is analogous to the functions it fulfils. In fact, pro- tected by its deep position from chemical or me-

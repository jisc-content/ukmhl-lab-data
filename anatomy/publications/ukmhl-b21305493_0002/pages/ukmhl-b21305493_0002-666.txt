I have a prepa- ration in which the tunica arachnoides is evi- dently ossified in several points; and as it is towards the dura mater that these productions are formed, they prove that the arachnoid mem- brane is distinct from it; for at these parts they are readily separated* Accidental Developement oj' the Serous System. I will not repeat here, what I have stated in speaking of the cellular tissue in respect to the formation of cysts* Perfectly similar to the serous membranes, these cysts should be really considered as an accidental deveiopement of these membranes; they have the same appearance, and almost the same texture; supply their fluid according to the same laws, seem to be the seat of continual absorption and exhalation, since it is in vain to empty them by puncture; the fluids are reproduced, so long as the cysts remain* For instance, compare the cyst which has formed accidentally along the spermatic cord to the tunica vaginalis filled with water in hydrocele. If the volume of these two tumours, which are often formed together, be the same, it is impossible to find any difference in the form, appearance, texture, properties, and functions, Arc*

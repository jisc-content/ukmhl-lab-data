DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. , 764 astonishingly these shades vary in others is sufficiently known. Hence the colouring of the skin nearly resembles that of the hair, which evidently depends upon the substance that exists in their capillary ducts; it is analogous to that of those spots from birth, commonly called moles, and in which a coat of extravasated fluids is never found between the epidermis and the corium. I believe, besides, we are yet but little acquainted with that substance which fills a part of the exterior capillary system. It does not cir- culate, but appears to stagnate until replaced by another. On examining the skin of a negro it is found black, and that is all. In maceration I have observed that this layer is sometimes removed with the epidermis, that at other times it remains attached to the corium. It is certainly uncon- nected with either, since both are of the same hue in white and in black subjects. When removed, it is never formed again. Cicatrices are white throughout the human species. Are white subjects provided with a whitish substance, which, stagnating in the exterior ca- pillary system, corresponds to that of negroes, or does the colour of their skin only proceed from the epidermis and the corium ? I am rather in- clined to think that white men are also provided with a colouring substance, since the long conti- nued action of a powerful sun evidently tans them. This circumstance has even led to a belief,

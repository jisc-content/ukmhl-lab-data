422 MUSCULAR SYSTEM If from experiments we pass to the bed-side of the patient, we find all cerebral affections per- fectly unconnected with the muscular system of organic life ; wounds in the head attended with depression, funguses of the brain, effusions of blood, pus, or serum, apoplexies, &c. bear wholly upon the voluntary muscles, the action of which they either exalt, reduce, or annul. Amidst the general confusion of animal life the organic life remains uninjured; the state of insanity, and of malignant fevers, equally prove this fact. Who is not aware that in these last cases frequently the pulse is not altered, that it is even sometimes reduced ? Head-aches are frequently attended with spas- modic vomitings; the motion of the heart is ac- celerated by cerebral inflammations, &c.; but these are sympathetic phenomena, which affect the organic muscles as well as every other sys- tem ; their course cannot be indicated, since it is attended by numerous irregularities, whilst the contraction of the muscles of animal life, from affections of the brain, is a constant and invaria- ble phenomenon, which nothing disturbs or pre- vents, because the means of communication be- tween the affected organ and the one that moves is invariably the same. If in the study of the phenomena resulting from cerebral influence upon the muscles of or- ganic life we fpllow reverse order, that is to

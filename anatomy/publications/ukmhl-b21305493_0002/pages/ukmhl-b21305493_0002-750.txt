GLANDULAR SYSTEM. T08 SECTION II. Vital Properties. Properties of Animal Life. Animal contractility is evidently wanting in the glandular tissue. Is this tissue endowed with animal sensibility ? Here are a few facts on this head: 1st. The compression of the parotid gland is in some degree painful. I have even, in some cases, been obliged to discontinue the me- thod of compression which had been prescribed by Desault for a salivary fistula, on account of the severity it produced ; but the numerous nerves that cross this gland might have been the cause. We are aware, that at the moment the lythoto- mist cuts the prostate, or that it is compressed by the stone and pmoere, the patient suffers great pain. The presence of calculi is often attended with excruciating pains; 2dly. A moderately strong compression of the testis is very painful,. &c. The tissue of the liver however may be di- vided, and yet the animal may give no signs of pain. After a continuation of experiments, Hal- ler has ranked the glands amongst the insensible parts. What must be concluded from all this ? That animal sensibility, modified in innumerable forms, seems to exist in a number ot organs

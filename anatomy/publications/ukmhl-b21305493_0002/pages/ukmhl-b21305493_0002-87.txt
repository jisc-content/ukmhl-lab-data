45 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. ment. Its bifurcation, however, in the medullary canal, was perfectly injected, and no deficiency besides in the nutrition of the medullary tube, which had probably received the same quantity of blood as usual, could be observed. I could see nothing near to the aperture that could ac- count for this obliteration, an exostosis, an affec- tion of the periosteum, or an inflammation, might readily have produced it. On the other hand, it is sufficiently known that very considerable lamellae are frequently exfo- liated by caries from the heads of the long bones, in consequence of which every vessel correspond- ing to these lamellae is destroyed, and that the bone is alive under that part, and is nourished by the blood it receives from the extremities of the artery of the medullary organ. This is also al- most what takes place in the long bones during the early stages of life, when the ends of the cartilages are unprovided with vessels of the se- cond order, and that consequently nearly the whole vascular supply proceeds from the same ar- tery of the medullary organ. On this account it . is proportionally much larger, as well as the fo- ramen intended to receive it. Nothing has hitherto been proved in respect to the system of the absorbant and exhalant organs of the bones ; and our reasonings on this head are guided by analogy only ; however, the nutritive function evidently implies their existence.

MUCOUS S VST KM. 559 cited at the time of erection, its sensibility rejects this fluid and admits of the semen only. Who is not aware, that in one kind of epiphora, the mu- cous issues for the tears are free, and that this fluid is merely prevented from flowing from the reduction of their vital powers ? The sensibility of the mucous surfaces is frequently so changed, that their glands will admit of no kind of fluid whatever. This is what happens in certain cases of peripneumony, wherein the expectoration is wholly suppressed, a fatal symptom, and even generally terminating in death if no change oc- * curs in the state of the sensibility, if an effort, as it is commonly termed, does not take place. Generally speaking, there are, I believe, few systems more deserving of consideration than this, on account of the innumerable alterations to which it is liable, alterations supposing almost constantly those of the vital properties predomi- nating in this system, as the alterations in the muscular nervous systems, &c. most generally bring into play the properties more particularly belonging to them, namely, animal contractility for the one, animal sensibility for the other. Sensible organic contractility does not seem to be one of the properties of the mucous system; but it occasionally displays something more than the insensible oscillations which constitute the other species of organic contractility : in the emis-

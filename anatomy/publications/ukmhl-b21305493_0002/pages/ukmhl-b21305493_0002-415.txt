In those of a reflected one; 3dly. In those which assume the circular direction. In the first, as in the limbs of the trunk, if they are of a lengthened shape, and terminate in a tendon, each fibre on contracting draws the tendon on its side; from whence there results, that all contribute to draw it nearer to the centre of the muscle, but that each of them at the same time tend to give it another direction, and in this respect they are antagonists; the common motion remains ; the opposed one is destroyed. In long muscles, the whole effort of the contrac- tion is concentrated on a single point of the tendon. In the greatest part of wide muscles on the contrary, the insertions being in the sides and by different points, all the fibres have not an uniform action. Thus different parts of the same muscle may be intended for very different and even for opposite uses ; thus the lower part of the serratus-major does not act like the upper ; fre- quently even different portions of the same mus- cles do not contract simultaneously. In the long muscles on the contrary, as every fibre concurs

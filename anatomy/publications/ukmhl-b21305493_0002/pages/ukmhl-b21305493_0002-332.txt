MUSCULA K SYSTEM 290 the animal creation supplies the voracious species with abundance of materials for their nutrition. Thus nature, by multiplying these organs in the individual they are intended to move, seems also to have held in view, the wants of other animals that are destined at some period to feed upon them. By forming them in each species, she has effectually provided for all. Who can tell if this general end, which observation displays in a great series of the animal creation, is not the cause of that remarkable predominance which the muscles display over every other system ? Who knows if nature would not have simplified the powers of animal mechanism, which are so very numerous and so considerably multiplied when compared with those of our artificial ma- chines ? Who can say that she would not have w simplified the means, and produced the same re- sults, if the motions to be performed by animals, had been her only object in forming the muscles ? The sex has considerable influence upon the quality of the flesh of animals. I do not believe that anything has yet been stated respecting the influence of the genital parts in this respect, but the following lines contain some remarkable facts. The muscles of the male, larger and more energetic, have a superior flavour, resist boiling much longer, are firmer, &c. Boiling water on the con- trary, affects those of the female much sooner; it is softer, and gives to the liquor a weaker flavour.

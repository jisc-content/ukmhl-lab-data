54 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. hence proceed the various and sympathetic affec- tions of secretion, perspiration, and exhalation. In the nervous system the animal sensibility is sympathetically excited ; hence proceed the dull and fixed pains in different parts. In the organic muscular system, it is the organic contractility that is augmented ; hence the irregular motions of the heart, of tlfe stomach, and the intestines. Two orders of sympathies constantly attend the acute affections of every organ, some relating to the affected organ, as cough, pains in the side, expec- toration of blood, the difficulty attending respira- tion, &c., in peripneumony,; others merely sym- pathetic, and proceeding from the connections between the vitality of that organ with those of every other: now the latter are frequently much more numerous than the former. Let us only consider the bones amidst the ge- neral sympathetics affecting the systems in which vitality is very active; they undergo no altera- tion : their vitality, slower in its progress than that of the other systems, cannot admit of the phenomena that bear an acute type. It is the same in respect to cartilage, fibro-cartilage, hair, aponeurosis, &c.; all of these systems are remark- able for a similar character of vitality, but do not correspond with the acute affections of the other systems : they are not acted upon during these affections, at least in any striking degree. II we regard the acute fevers, we find that their innu-

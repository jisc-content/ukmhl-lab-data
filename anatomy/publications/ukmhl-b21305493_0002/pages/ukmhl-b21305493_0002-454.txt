412 MUSCULAR SYSTEM died of this disease is laid open without dividing the bloated intestines, these instantly swell still more, and require double the space to what they had occupied in the abdomen. Why is this? Because the parieties of the abdomen not calcu- lated to yield proportionally to the quantities of gas that has been produced, these have, during life, been compressed in the intestines, and in- stantly expand in virtue of their contractility when the cause of compression is removed. Dis- tention being slowly produced in dropsies, the ab- dominal parieties yield much more than in tym- panites. In this disease the volume of the abdo- men would be double to the other, if the exten- sibility of its parieties were proportionate with that of the intestines. We may form some idea of the extensibility of the organic muscles, by comparing an empty sto- mach, which is frequently not larger than the coecum in its natural state, with the same organ containing five, six, and even eight pints of fluid ; the bladder contracted on itself, and hid behind the pubes, with one filled with urine rising in some cases of retention above the umbilicus ; the rectum empty, with that in which, with aged subjects, the faeces have been accumulating and filling a part of the pelvis, the intestines contracted with those inflated with gas. To the great extensibility of the organic mus- cles, and to the limited degree of this property in

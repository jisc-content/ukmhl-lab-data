OSSEOUS SVSTEM. 117 probable, that the roots and partitions are destroy- ed by an absorption of the calcareous phosphate, nearly in the same way as we have stated that the internal cavities of the cartilaginous bones are formed. From this it is seen, that the ossification of the roots of the first dentition, is but of short con- tinuance ; it begins the last and ends the first; when it is nearly completed the teeth begin to move for want of sufficient insertion. The de- struction of the partition increases the motion; they begin to fall towards the sixth or seventh year; this is affected in the same order as that of their protrusion ; that is to say, the incisores begin to fall, the cuspidati follow, then the molares drop in turn. Let us remark, however, that the lasty. those which appeared at four years of age, are not renewed. Second Dentition considered daring the Protrusion. During the protrusion of the second teeth, they are seen to grow gradually and in the same order as those corresponding to them are loosened ; 1st. The eight incisores ; 2dly. The four canine teeth appear; 3dly. In the place of the first grinder two new ones are formed, they are those that will be afterwards denominated small grinders; 4thly. The second grinder, as we have just said, re-

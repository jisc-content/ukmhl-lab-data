50 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. contractility oi the tissue, is not so readily per- formed as that in muscles, in the skin, &c. when they cease to be distended f>y a tumour, a collec- tion of serum, &c. This proceeds from the dif- ference of the organic tissue, from the rigidity of the bony fibres, caused by the calcareous sub- stance with which they are loaded. On this account, organic sensibility is not so evident in these organs. section nr. Vital Properties. In their natural state, bones are almost entirely deprived of animal properties; they do not pos- sess sensibility ; the saw, the mallet, or the chisel may be applied with impunity to their tissue,â€” a dull sensation being the only result; even fire will destroy it without causing much pain. In a state of disease, however, the sensibility is very acute; the excruciating pains attending the spina-ventosa, and those not less acute, the ef- fect of caries, &c. in some cases, are sufficiently known. If a bone undergo inflammation, as in the extremities of an amputated stump, for instance, which in the natural state had sustained the action of the saw, without transmitting any painful sensation, it becomes, as it were, a new sensitive organ, in which the least con-

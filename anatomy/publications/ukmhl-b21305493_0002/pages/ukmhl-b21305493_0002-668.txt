SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 026 The synovial membranes are much less frequently the seat of chronic tubercular inflammation than the serous, in which they are very frequent. However, I have seen two examples of this affec- tion in the synovial membrane of the knee, and I believe also that these are the only systems in which it is observed ; so that its occurrence in both shows some analogy of character, whilst its being much less frequent in the one constitutes a distinction. 6thlv. The different kinds of adhe- sions which I have noticed with respect to the serous surfaces are not found in the synovial, wherein that only which identifies these two adherent surfaces is observed; a mode that fre- quently takes place in anchylosis, which is as frequently produced by this as by the stiffness of the parts surrounding the articulation. 7thly. The synovial surfaces are not so frequently as the serous the seat of these remarkable locomotions we have mentioned, which proceed from the articulating organs not being, like the major part of those invested by serous surfaces, liable to al- ternate dilatations and contractions. The synovial system evidently presents two grand divisions. To the one the articulating system belongs ; that of the tendinous grooves to the other. We will examine them separately.

359 OF ANIMAL LIFE. « served, that the convulsive motion is very rapid, similar to that obtained by exciting* the very muscles themselves. Notwithstanding what some physiologists have written, it is impossible, by irritating a flexor, to produce that powerful con- traction, a contraction comparable with that which is voluntary. If, after amputation of an inferior extremity, tfye sciatic nerve be ex- cited, the toes will never bend with the same force which they frequently display in their na- tural state. In amputations performed by De- sault, I have made this experiment twice, and at that time ignorant of physiology, I was very much struck with this phenomenon. It is not possible by irritating the brain or spinal marrow, to appreciate the powers of con- traction with that same accuracy as when an iso- lated nerve has been excited : in fact, the whole system coming convulsively into action, the ex- tensors partly destroy the efforts of the flexors, and vice versa ; the muscles simultaneously put in motion, check, and counterbalance each other. Galvanism has always appeared to me the most powerful agent for producing npuscular contraction. During life, the degree of muscular contraction depends upon two causes ; 1st. On the muscle ; 2dly. On the brain. These two causes are in variable proportions,—they should be con- sidered separately. Acted upon by the same power, the muscie

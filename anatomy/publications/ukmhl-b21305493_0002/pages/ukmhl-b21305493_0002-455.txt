OF ORGANIC LIFE. 413 those of the abdominal parieties, must be referred a phenomenon constantly observed in respect to the gastric viscera; namely, that in the natural series of their functions they are never all dis- tended at the same time ; the intestines fill when the stomach has voided the matter it contained; the bladder in the order of digestion is filled with urine, when the other hollow organs are empty, &c. In general, it is against the order of nature for all the organs to be distended at the same time. The organic muscles possess also a mode of extensibility quite different from what I have just mentioned; it is that of the heart in aneu- risms, that of the womb in pregnancy. The left side of the former, for instance, acquires twice, sometimes even thrice its natural volume, and yet it continues to increase in thickness. This increase is not owing to a distention; but actually to unnatural growth. The heart affected with aneurism, is to the natural one what an adultâ€™s is to that of a child ; the difference is owing to nu- trition and not to distention ; for when this is the case, it loses in thickness what it acquires in ex- tent, there being no additional substance : besides, the heart affected with aneurism has frequently no cause of distention, for generally in these cases the mitral valves leave a free passage to the blood, whilst when they are ossified, the left part often remains in the natural state. The slow formation of aneurism also sufficiently shows that

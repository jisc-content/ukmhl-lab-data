SYSTEM OF THE IIAIK. 937 tissue of this membrane. The extent of this canal, and consequently that of the course of the hair, either under or in the skin, measure nearly five lines in the hair of the head. No adherence whatever exists between the hair and the internal surface of that canal, except in the swollen basis of the former, where it seems to receive its nutrition. Thus, by opening the canal in this part, and by destroying the adhesion, the hair is left free, and may be drawn out with the utmost facility, by seizing with tweezers the swollen part. By this mode of operating, the tube is left free. By adopting this mode, I have dissected and separated, in a surface of two inches, a considerable number of these tubes, which, when nothing else was left on the internal surface of the skin, appeared like so many small extensions of this organ. Do vessels and nerves reach this cylindrical bag containing the root of the hair ? Prolonga- tions are actually seen extending as far as the external surface, particularly towards the part farthest from the skin; but we do not learn from dissection what is the nature of these extentions. I never succeeded in following them down to a neighbouring nerve or vessel. Although Haller quotes several authors who have traced nerves up to the origin of the hair, he has himself not been more successful. I presume, however, that these prolongations are essentially vascular. Is there

DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 872 that of every other system, answers the more effectually the stimulants applied to it, as they are the more reverse of those whose influence it previously experienced. In the natural state, there is nothing more than the succession of sea- sons ; and even then, nature has connected cold and heat together by a succession of impercepti- ble links, and there is rarely any abrupt transi- tion. But in society, the varieties of dress, the artificial degrees of temperature in our apart- ments, degrees first quite different from that of the open atmosphere, and from each other, so that the same individual, by entering in winter thirty different apartments, often exposes himself to thirty different degrees of temperature; the hard labour of the generality of men, and which are attended with violent perspiration ; every thing, in short, affords innumerable causes for rapid variations in the powers of the dermoidal system. Thus in cities the mucous surface of the bronchise is incessantly in contact with num- berless different causes of irritation, with which the air is naturally loaded. Thus our aliment, dressed in a thousand different ways, differing in temperature, &c. continually varies the action of the mucous surface of the digestive organs, and gives rise to a multiplicity of affections, from which most other parts of the animal creation are free, in consequence of the uniformity of their food.

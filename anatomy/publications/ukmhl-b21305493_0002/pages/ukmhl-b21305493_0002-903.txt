861 DERMOIOAL SYSTEM. to condense by degrees, and form a transparent envelopment, through which the subjacent or- gan, particularly the blood vessels, are partly seen, and which admits of being lacerated by the slightest effort. This state continues nearly two months. The consistence increasing in this organ, soon acquires an aspect approaching more to that observed in infants subsequent to birth. At this period it is excessively thin, its thickness being scarcely one-fourth that of the adult. It appears that the moment this organ begins to rise, its mucous state is the very time when the fibres begin to form. Hitherto it was especially com- posed of cellular tissue and vessels, and as the former contains at this time a superabundant quantity of juices, it is not surprising that it diffuses from the slightest pressure. But as soon as the fibres begin to form, on the one part the cellular tissue diminishes, and is concentrated within the areolae that begins to form; on the other hand, the fibres of the dermis being denser than its laminae, increase its resistance. The greater part of the wrinkles we have spoken of, are never seen on the external sur- face of the skin of the foetus. Those in the face in particular, are never observed, and the almost complete want of motion of the muscles of this part is the reason. The forehead, eyelids, the ridges of the lips, are even and smooth. The superabundant quantity of fat besides, with which

The term, obstructed respiration, is misapplied in expressing what then occurs, and conveys but an incorrect idea. Let us suppose pleurisy to be the result of sudden cold, what follows is the consequence ; the organic sensibility of the skin being suddenly altered, that of the pleura follows .3 i 2

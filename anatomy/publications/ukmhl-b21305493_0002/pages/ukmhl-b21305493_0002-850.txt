DERMOIDAL SVSTGitf. 808 subjects in a far advanced state of dissolution, the breath had nearly the same putrid smell as that arising from these bodies. I have also observed that a similar effect is produced by handling putrid matter. Of course, then, the absorbents trans- mit these effluvia to the blood, by which they are subsequently expelled through the mucous sur- faces of the intestines. Thus whenever urine is absorbed, the saliva, mucous juices, &c. borrow from that fluid a urinary smell. I might produce a multiplicity of further proofs in support of cutaneous absorption; but I have merely selected the most striking. Several more have been quoted, by Haller in particular, to whom I refer, as in his work he has accumulated innumerable instances. I have observed, however, that cutaneous ab- sorptions are characterized by a remarkable irre- gularity ; that apparently under the very same influence they sometimes take place, at other times they are not effected. Thus it is, that most generally,nothing is absorbed in the bath; that con- tagious principles are either taken in or rejected ; that vaccination succeeds or fails; and that ino- culation, &c. is sometimes very doubtful. Let us not wonder at this, the absorption of such and such a substance requires a determined degree of sensibility in the skin: above or below this de- gree the absorbents will reject the substance. Thus if by a purgative the natural degree of the

477 OF organic life. the voluntary muscles, the motion of the heart is undoubtedly very remarkable in the foetus; but it is not so, compared to what it will be subsequent to birth. The very same thing is observed in respect to the contractility of the stomach, bladder, and in- testines : stimulants in general fail to produce any kind of motion in these muscles. Leveille has already set forth these important observations; he has also observed 'urine stagnate in the blad- der, and meconium in the large intestines, without producing sufficient contraction for their expul- sion. I do not believe, however, that the gastric viscera are ever wholly immoveable during life ; and this is the reason : most commonly the meco- nium is met with in the large intestines only ; of course, then, it must originate in these organs, if it be true that the gastric muscles are motionless. Now it is much more probable that it is a residue of the bile, of all the mucous juices, &c.; that, consequently, it is progressively conveyed by a slow action, from the superior to the inferior part of the alimentary canal. The softness of the organic muscles renders their extensibility much less striking at that stage. The heart of the dead foetus, however, does not present these innumerable varieties of volume so frequently observed in the right side of that of an adult, according to the nature of the death.

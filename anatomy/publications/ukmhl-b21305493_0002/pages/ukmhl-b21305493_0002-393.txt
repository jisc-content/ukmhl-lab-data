OF ANIMAL LIFE. 351 The difference, also, of the exciting cause, occa- sions this twofold mode of contraction ; if the knife be moved over a muscle full of life, a com- plete contraction will be the result; if the same organ then be strewed with a neutral salt, a simi- lar contraction is sometimes produced ; but fre- quently there is nothing more than an oscilla- tion, or vibration, similar to that observed in a muscle that is nearly deprived of life. During the life of an animal, its sensible or- ganic contractility is seldom brought into play, because the muscles have no agents that act upon them, at least in a sensible manner. Why is it, then, that this property is so considerable ? I cannot account for it. Every muscle is not possessed of this property in an equal degree; the diaphragm and the inter* costals are the most irritable; in these, also, orga- nic contractility is continued for a longer time after death. It may be remarked that this, as well as their readiness to admit of the nervous in- fluence, from artificial irritation, particularly of the diaphragmatic nerve, forms a contrast with the difficulty with which, during life, they are affected by convulsions and palsy in turn. Next to these the masseter, the buccinator, &c. are the most irritable muscles; form respect to irritability there is an essential distinction between these and the muscles of the limbs, which are nearly all equally affected by the operation of stimulants.

CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 168 a very striking vascular layer is interposed be. tween the cartilage and the bony substance al- ready formed ; these two parts, united by a slight adherence only, are easily separated. Upon the surface of each, after being removed, different asperities, projections, and depressions, that in- dent with each other, are also observed. The want of adherence between these two bony and cartilaginous portions, before ossification is com- pleted, has probably given rise to all that has been said in respect to the separation of the epiphysis, â€”a phenomenon very seldom ascertained by the observations of our present surgeons. In proportion as the calcareous phosphate reaches the extremity of the bone, the vessels dis- appear, and the adhesions become more perfect. Finally, ossification being completed, on the one hand, an evident vascular net is no longer observed between the cartilage and the bone, and on the other, their adherence is such that their disjunction is almost impossible. These two characters espe- cially distinguish the connection of the cartilage of ossification with the bone, from that of the real cartilage with the same bone. I have also ob- served, that most generally, and above its union with the ossified part, the cartilage of ossification is not so white, and displays a deeper hue, ex- tending to the distance of the sixth or fourth part of an inch, and which is sometimes very striking ;

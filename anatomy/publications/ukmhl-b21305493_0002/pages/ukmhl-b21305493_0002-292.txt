250 FIBROUS SYSTEM â€¢> I have observed in the ligaments of the knee, in a subject otherwise of a very emaciated habit. The ligaments contain a few blood-vessels. In certain diseases of the articulations their vascular system is developed in a very remarkable manner, and they are permeated with a great quantity of blood; no nerves can be discovered. Sometimes the ligamentous tissue is converted into a greasy matter, in which there is no sem- blance of fibres. This matter is very seldom re- stored to its primitive state, and is almost always met with in those organic diseases that prove fatal. The ligaments strongly unite together the ar- ticulating surfaces, prevent their displacement, and yet admit of easy motions ; a twofold function they fulfil in virtue of a twofold property, of their resistance on the one part, of their softness and flexibility on the other : outwardly they sometimes give insertion to a few muscles. SECTION II. Ligaments composed of irregular Fasciculi. These are irregular fibres strewed here and there over the ossified surfaces, without any or- der, interwoven in various directions between the sacrum and os ilium, over the summit of the

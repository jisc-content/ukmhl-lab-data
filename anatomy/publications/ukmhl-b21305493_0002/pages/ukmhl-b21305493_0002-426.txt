MUSCULAR SYSTEM 384 in their arteries at that stage of life, and which penetrates their muscles, is not so very fit to pro- duce and maintain motion. In fact, at that stage, it is the dark blood that reaches their muscles through the vessels. Now we know that in the adult, every time this species of blood is acci- dentally circulated in the arterial system, life is endangered, the muscular motion weakened, and asphyxia soon ensues. To the nature and colour of the blood in the foetus, must be attributed the livid, and frequently the dark hue, displayed by the muscles; for this is another character that distinguishes them from those in the aes It, they are not only paler, but their colour is Tjuite dif- ferent ; and before the foetus has breathed, have always the character I have pointed out. In the foetus the muscles are thin, and but slightly prominent : they are much less deve- loped than those of organic life. The size of the extremities proceeds from their sub-cutaneous fat : when this fat is not very abundant, and the ex- tremities are compared with the trunk, they are much less in proportion to this than they will be in the progress of time. In foetuses that are pos- sessed of abundance of cutaneous fact, when all the skin is removed this disproportion of bulk is likewise observed. We are aware, that at that \ * stage of life every cavity for muscular insertion, every apophysis intended for the same use, is hardly in existence. The parieties of the temporal

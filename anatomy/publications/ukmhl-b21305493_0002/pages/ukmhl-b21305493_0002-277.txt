235 FIBROUS SYSTEM. the semi-tendinous, semi-membranosus, and bi- ceps, with the tibial, Ac. As in the extensive motions of the limbs, in which every muscle has the most tendency to be displaced, these are unavoidably called into ac- tion, they strongly distend the aponeuroses; which by that means reflect the motion imparted, and particularly prevent every kind of displacement. Whenever the limb is at rest, the tensors cease to contract, and the aponeurosis is slack- ened. I have observed, that the muscles in- serted into the fibrous capsules, as into that of the humerus, for instance, actually fulfil, in this respect, the functions of extensors with their re- spective aponeuroses. The hue of the latter is a resplendent white ; they differ in this respect from every fibrous or- gan hitherto considered, and are analogous with the tendons, from which however they rather differ in nature: in fact, they resist maceration and ebullition much longer; their fibres are stifler, and more resistant. There are no aponeuroses per- fectly similar to the tendons, except those essen- tially formed by their expansions, or situate at their origin ; such as those extended over the rec- tus fern oris, those that are concealed within the fleshy fibres of a muscle, and which subsequently pass from it to form a tendon. In certain parts of the limbs, as on the upper part of the arm for instance, the aponeuroses for general envelope-

629 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. 4 In this last century, however, several anatomists have cast some doubts upon the reality of these glandular bodies. Lieutand has confounded them with the greasy cellular tissue, and Desault does not distinguish them from it. Every thing has confirmed me in the same opinion, which seems indisputably supported by a number of considera- tions. 1st. These bodies of a reddish appearance are only seen in particular articulations: there are many in which their existence is admitted by supposition only. 2dly. It is certain that none are observed in the greatest part of the synovial membranes of the tendons, although Havers, Al- binus, Juncke, and Fourcroy, have placed them in all, grounding their opinions, no doubt, upon analogy, but not upon inspection. In these two cases, however, synovia is equally separated, and lubricates the surfaces of the articulations and tendinous sheaths. This separation then is inde- pendent of glandular action. 3dly. If the syno- vial glands, (the best characterized) such as those of the cotyloid cavity, be examined, no traces whatever can be discovered of that parenchyma, unknown in its nature, but very remarkable by its structure, which in general composes the glands, and which distinguishes them from other parts, constituting their organic character. 4thly. No excretory duct can possibly be demonstrated in these organs. Those under the form of a fringe, admitted by Havers, are imaginary. Bertin him-

The figure of the testis changes whenever the tunica albuginea has been implicated, &c. This adherence of the fibrous membrane which incloses different organs, with the interior prolongations of these organs, with the fibres that form their can- vas, has induced several anatomists to believe that their nature is similar; that these were nothing more than elongations of the membrane. I was of this opinion myself when I published my treatise upon the membranes, but ulterior experi- ments have undeceived me. First, I can affirm, that the membranes of the corpora cavernosa exclusively belong, in these bodies, to the fibrous system. The interior spongy tissue contained within the cavity of the mem- brane has not the same nature, and is not, as

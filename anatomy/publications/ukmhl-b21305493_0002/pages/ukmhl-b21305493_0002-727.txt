GLANDULAR SYSTEM. G85 By means of these infusions, purgatives, emetics, and a variety of other foreign substances were cir- culated, the contact of which the blood had to sustain, without causing the animal any other injury, except producing vomiting, and alvine evacuations ; if purgatives and emetics had been injected, a general uneasiness more or less ex- tended, if it were other foreign substances that had no affinity with any determined organ. Caustics only, such as nitric acid, the surphuric, and other very irritating substances, have caused death, in these curious experiments described by Haller, and which prove that several substances, perfectly foreign to the blood, may circulate with it *, that this fluid is a common torrent, in which a multiplicity of different principles are intermixed, but which must necessarily be always alike. In these experiments, the most important part has been neglected, that of the infusion of the various animal fluids, of secreted fluids in particular, and much more still of fluids, eventually produced in morbid states. I think that the infusion of the various kinds of pus, sanies, &c. might throw much light on the different re-absorptions. But we al- ready possess a sufficient number of facts to affirm, that fluids, and particularly the blood, may be dis- eased ; that divers heterogeneous substances mix- ing with it may produce fatal effects in respect to the solids; in fact, every sour and irritating sub- stance, without being mortal, will accelerate the

OF ORGANIC LIFE. 447 the womb have been produced at the expence of those of all the other organs. In experiments the results obtained from the female are less striking, and not near so long continued as those from the male. The heart, the stomach, the in- testines, &c. cease their action much quicker; these motions are less ; they require more power- ful agents to be excited, &c. Fifth Variety.â€” Season and Climate. During winter and in cold climates, when the cutaneous organ, contracted and shrunk, as it were, by the impression of the surrounding at- mosphere, is in a weak state of action^ all the interior functions more active, necessitate addi- tional energy in the powers which preside over them ; all the phenomena of digestion, the excre- tion of urine, and even of circulation, are better developed. I am not aware that comparative ex- periments have yet been made respecting the degrees of irritability in the different seasons; but I am convinced they would give different results. Sensible Organic Contractility considered in re- spect to the Action of the Stimulating Agents over the Organs. We have just examined separately, both the excitant and the organ upon which it acts, each

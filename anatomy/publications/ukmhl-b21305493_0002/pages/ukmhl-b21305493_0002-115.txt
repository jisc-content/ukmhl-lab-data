73 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. much more considerable in the extensors, than in the flexors; why the large vascular and nervous trunks are constantly placed on the side in which flexion is performed, as is seen in the thigh, in the leg, in the fore arm, and in the phalanges, &c. There is always something or other that limits the motion of extension, as the olecranon in the hu- mero-cubital articulation, the cross ligaments in the femoro-tibial articulation, &c. Although there are no characteristic motions of circumduction in the genera we are now con- sidering, yet, when the leg or the fore arm are in a state of flexion, they are able to move laterally, and even to describe the cone, but in a very slight degree only. During extension, this is utterly impossible, because the lateral ligaments being stretched, they will not yield sufficiently to suffer the bone to move from one side to the other. Fourth Genus. Opposition or circumduction of any descrip- tion, are wanting in this genus, that contains nothing more than rotation, as those of the ulna and radius, as the atlas and occiput afford instances of. Sometimes there is a concave surface re- volving over a convex one, as in the lower part of the radius, and in the odontoid apophysis; at other times, there is a convex surface, moving in a con-

171 CARTILAGINOUS system. same manner as the earthy substance in the bone, the fibrine in the muscles, &c5 &c. In the latter years of life, ossification invades every cartilage, but begins in a reverse sense with those of the cavities, and with those belonging to the articulations. In the former, it originates in the centre; in the latter, on the surface that cor- responds to the bone :—it is in general more tardy in these, and particularly in the moveable than in the immoveable articulations. The cartilages of the larynx and of the ribs are ossified in their centres, from the age of thirty-six to forty, and even prior to this; this state, after that period, gradually increases, so much so, that in old age the section of the thyroid cartilage is attended with much difficulty. In a great num- ber of operations in which I have directed the stu- dent’s hand, I have constantly had occasion to convince myself, that after sixty, the knife com- monly in use was, in nearly every instance, insuffi- cient to effect the section, and that it required one more highly tempered. The ossification of the costal cartilages prevent the aged subject from performing any longer those considerable efforts of inspiration so common in youth ; with them it is chiefly the diaphragm that acts. I also attri- bute to this premature ossification in the cartilages of cavities, a state constantly attended with a de- velopement of the vascular system, the much greater frequency of caries in this species of carli-

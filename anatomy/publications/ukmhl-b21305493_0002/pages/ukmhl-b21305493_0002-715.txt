The tissue of the prostrate gland seems rather susceptible of some elasticity. The want of fibrous structure in the glands appear to be the chief cause of this difference. Submitted to the sudden action of a very quick fire, as in roasting, the interna^ tissue of the liver and of other glands shrinks and contracts. From this effect there results over the surface a kind of crust impermeable in part to the juices contained within the organ, the internal substance of which is softened and cooked by these juices. This phenomenon, besides, is common to all the solids : hence in roasting meat, muscular or glandular, it is first exposed to the action of a very quick fire ; when the contraction of the surface has been pro- duced, the degree of caloric is reduced by lessen- ing the fire, and the process gently continued. When macerating in water, glands yield variously to its effect. The liver yields less than the kidneys, which after remaining for two months in vessels laid in cellars, are diffused into a reddish pulp floating in the fluid ; whilst the former for the same time, and even longer, retains its form and density: its red hue only is changed to a blueish brown, a characteristic the reverse to that of the kidneys, which, on macerating, re- main the same. The salivary glands contain a vol. ir. X X

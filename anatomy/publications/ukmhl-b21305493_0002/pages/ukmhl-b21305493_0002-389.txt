OF ANIMAL LIFE. 347 which seems to afford the most effectual means of prolonging animal contractility for some time after death. Organic Properties. Organic sensibility is evidently allotted to the muscles we are considering ; incessantly brought into play in these organs, by nutrition, absorption and exhalation, it is still the better displayed, when the muscles laid bare are submitted to irritation ; they are sensible of this irritation, and the mo- bility we are about to mention is a result of this sensation, which is concentrated in the muscles, and cannot be referred to the brain. Insensible organic contractility is amongst the properties of the muscular system, as well as those of every other system. Sensible organic contractility is very obvious in these organs. If a muscle be laid bare in a living animal, and irritated by any agent what- ever, it will shrink, twist, and contract. A por- tion of muscle on being removed, will present a similar phenomenon for some length of time. Every thing becomes an exciting cause for a muscle laid bare; air, water, neutral salts, acids, alkalies, earths, metals, animal and vegetable substances, &c. The mere contact is sufficient to produce contraction ; however, besides this con- tact, there is still something which depends upon

I FIBUOUS SYSTEM. 249 designated. Some, however, have no connection with the articulations: as we find instances, in that stretched between the coracoid and acro- mion apophyses, in those which complete the dif- ferent bony notches, the orbitary for example. These organs form bundles, sometimes cylin- drical, at other times flattened, fixed in, or rather interwoven at their extremities with the perios- teum, easily removed with this organ during in- fancy, but adhering to the adult bone by the ossification of the internal lamellee of this mem- brane. Their analogy with tendons is very striking; the external difference consists in their adhering to the periosteum on both sides, whilst it is on one side only the tendons are continuous with the muscles. The same organ is frequently seen to form a tendon at one age, and a ligament at another, a circumstance that is particularly re- marked in the inferior ligament of the patella. These differ also, as we have remarked, in their composition. All the ligaments are formed by an assemblage of fibres parallel in the middle, divergent in the ends, united by a cellular tissue, looser than that of the tendons, and which frequently contains a few flakes of fat; at times they are so abundantly supplied with this substance, that they assume an aspect analogous with the adipose muscles ; this

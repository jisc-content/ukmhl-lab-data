OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 103 The Enamel of the Tooth. The enamel is only found round the crown of the tooth. Several anatomists have asserted, that it exists in some degree over the root, grounding their opinion, I suppose, on the excessive whiteness of some drawn teeth, which prevents the line where it terminates from being seen; but in such cases a very simple experiment will point out the distinc- tion. This method consists in macerating the tooth in nitric acid, diluted with a certain quantity of water; the acid will operate both upon the root, and upon the crown, which it softens ; but like al- most every other animal substance submitted to its action, the one becomes yellow, whilst the other preserves its appearance, and even becomes whiter. This experiment proves likewise, that their respective natures also essentially differ. The enamel thick in the free part of the crown, becomes gradually thinner as it draws near the root. This disposition is indispensable to protect the tooth, and chiefly to bear the efforts of masti- cation, which chiefly affect the free part of the crown. This substance hard and compact, particularly after having been exposed to the air, yielding with difficulty to the file, is composed of very close fibres, the direction of which cannot be followed. It seems impermeable to the medullary oil; does

A slight inflammation of the external surface of the bladder causes a kind of incontinence of urine ; that of the intestines brings on diarrhoea, &c. &c.; on the contrary, old catarrhs of the bladder, (affections in which the weakness of the mucous surface of that organ predominates), are frequent causes of retention, &c. The interposition of this intermedium consti- tutes a very remarkable difference between the sensible and the insensible organic contractility; no such interposition exists in the latter, wherein the very same system receives the impression, and re-acts upon the body that â€™has produced it; for instance, in the glandular, serous, cutaneous sys- tems, &c. the fluid that reaches them for secre- tion or exhalation produces in these systems a sensation which is instantly followed by re-ac- tion. In the sensible contractility on the con- trary, one system perceives and the other moves. This mode of action recedes less from that of animal life, in which the organs of our senses, and those of motion, totally differing, are far asunder. Sensible Organic Contractility considered relative to its Permanence after Death. This property is longer continued than that of animal contractility. On irritating the mar-

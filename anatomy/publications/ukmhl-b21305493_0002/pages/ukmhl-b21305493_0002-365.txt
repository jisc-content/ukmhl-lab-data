323 OF ANIMAL life. they circulate, as the experiments I lately pub- lished have, I conceive, sufficiently demonstrated. To these experiments let us add those of arti- ficial concussion. The muscles of the ox quiver, and refuse any further support the moment it re- ceives the blow. Animals under the stroke that meets the occiput, expire with convulsive mo- tions. In the limbs, rabbits frequently display this phenomenon. Pigeons die with a convulsive qui- vering of their wings. Irregular agitation pro- duced by an irregular distribution of the cerebral influence of the brain, always immediately pre- cede death resulting from the injury. From all these experiments, and from the pre- ceding observations, we may conclude that the action of the muscular system of animal life is constantly allied to the state of the brain, that whenever this action is increased or lessened, there is almost always an increase or diminution of the cerebral powers. Let us not exaggerate, however, the connec- tions between the cerebral phenomena and those of the muscles, for observation might contradict us. There are indeed various instances of serous, sanguineous, and even purulent collections, form- ing in the brain, without the muscular motion having been impaired. Different tumours and cases of mal-conformation have produced dis- turbance in the intellectual functions, without the muscles having participated in the injury. How y 2

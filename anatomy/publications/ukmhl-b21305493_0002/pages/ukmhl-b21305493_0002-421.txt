3T9 OF ANIMAL LIFE. the rectus abdominis contracts to fix the chest, and afford to the sterno-mastoideus, &c. a firm â€¢ Compound motion is that simultaneously pro- duced when two or several muscles act upon the same point. In this case, the moveable point follows the direction of neither of these muscles, if there are two, but the diagonal of their two- fold direction. Thus it is that the eye is moved out- ward and upward, outward and downward, &c.; that the head is lowered and carried to the right or to the left, and the arm is applied over the trunk, &c. In general, nature has placed the muscles around a moveable point, in particular directions only ; for instance, round the eye, in those of ele- vation and depression of adduction and abduction, the combination of these single motions produces the compound ones. If the adductor and de- pressor contract equally, the eye is maintained in a medium position; but if one act more forcibly than the other, the eye is directed accordingly; so that the four muscles, by moving separately, or two by two, with equal force, move the eye in eight different directions. There is also in all the intermediate directions a simultaneous ac- tion of two muscles, but, in point of force, one always predominates, thus it is that almost every motion of circumduction is performed. Whenever two muscles opposed to each other contract,the moveable point remains fixed. When

In the latter, all the fibres are continued either with tendons, with aponeuroses, or with fibrous membranes ; nearly all those of the first originate in the cellular tissue and return to it again, after having completed' their course. At first I believed that the dense and tight layer interposed between the mucous membrane and the fleshy fibres of the intestines, of the bladder, of the stomach, &c. was an assemblage and an interlacement of a multiplicity of minute tendons corresponding to these fibres, and woven in the form of an aponeu- rosis ; at first sight I was deceived by the density of this layer. By ebullition, maceration, and desic- cation, I have since ascertained that it is com- pletely unconnected with the fibrous system : this layer, as Haller has stated, should be referred to the cellular tissue, which in this part is denser and tighter than in any other. This is the layer I have described in the cellular system, under the name of sub-mucous tissue. Several fibres of the system we are now considering, appear to form a complete curve, without any cellular intersec- tion whatever. Some plans of the heart thus disposed, exhibit this structure, which in general is very rare, so that the fibres originate from and terminate in an organ, of a distinct nature from their own. The forms of this system cannot be considered in a general point of view ; everv organ that be- D D 9j

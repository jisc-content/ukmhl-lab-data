GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 664 effectual part in the excretion of urine. To empty the gall-bladder, the surrounding motions, I believe, can hardly be dispensed with. In general, when- ever fluids are collected in considerable quantity, the parietes of the organs are not very powerful, as those of the heart; for instance, the motions of the adjacent organs are indispensable to remove the obstacle opposed. In the capillary vessels, on the contrary, wherein fluids are disseminated, the re-action of the containing organ is sufficient for the motion. The glands are in some instances single, as the liver, the pancreas, &c. ; at other times they are in pairs, as the kidneys, the salivary, the lachrymal glands, &c. These, in general, resemble each other ; but this similitude is never to be compared to that of the double organs of animal life. One of the kidneys is lower than the other; there is no analogy, either in length or in volume, between their veins and nerves ; different clefts frequently observed in one are not to be found in the other, &c. This observation applies also to the salivary glands. The forms of the glands are not in general fixed and invariable; in their individual direc- tions, size, and proportions, a multiplicity of va- rieties are observed ; they are never moulded on that strict and rigorous plan, invariably followed by the organs of animal life. This fact is evident, even to those who have scarcely paid any attention

FIBROCARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 262 and the fibro-cartilage contracted by degrees* and the cavity became obliterated. In carcino- ma of the eye, where the eyelids are not re- moved, the tarsus with which the palpebree had been considerably extended, gradually contract and re-assume their primitive state ; besides, these phenomena should be perfectly distinguished from those which result from elasticitv : the lat- * ter are quick and abrupt: strongly distended, the fibro-cartilage yields in some degree, and abruptly re-assumes its primitive and natural position; the others, on the contrary, are the most fre- quently characterized by their remarkably slow progress. section in. Vital Properties. Every vital property is very obscure in the fibro-cartilages ; no such a thing as animal sensi- bility or contractility is to be met with in the na- tural state : the first property, however, is deve- loped by inflammation ; for they are possessed of organic sensibility and insensible contractility, in such a degree only as is indispensable for nutri- tion. Sensible organic contractility is completely wanting in this system. This obscurity in the vital properties necessi-

OF ORGANIC LIFE. 469 ing, total contraction, like that of the heart wherein every fibre of an oracle, or a ventricle, moves at the same time; here each fleshy fibre seems to act in succession. If placed at the origin of the large vessels, the stomach or bladder could not possibly propel the blood in jerks, as it is propelled from an artery at each contraction. On the other hand, the instant motion subsides in the stomach, the intestines, and the bladder, these os- cillations, always observed in the heart and in the voluntary muscles, and which may even be produced at will, are never seen. section v. Motions produced by the Organic Muscles. \ There is scarcely ever any simple motion in these muscles; the varied interlacement of their fleshy layers causes them generally to act on the substances they contain in three or four different directions. We cannot speak generally of those motions which compose the diastole of the heart, the peristaltic motion of the alimentary tube, the contraction of the bladder, &c. Each muscle has its mechanism that belongs to the physiological history of the function to which it contributes.

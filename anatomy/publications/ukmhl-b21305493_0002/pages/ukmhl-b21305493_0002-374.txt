MUSCULAR SYSTEM 33*2 1st. An inflamed muscle does not contract; the blood which penetrates its fibres, and the increase of its organic powers, prevent it from answering to the excitement. In quinsy, the deglutition is impeded as much by the want of power in the muscle, as by the in- flammation of the mucous membrane. It is ob- vious, that the inflammation of the bladder causes a retention of urine, and that of the diaphragm, throws the effects of respiration almost wholly upon the intercostal muscles. 2ndly. Every thing that tends to weaken, to relax the muscular tissue, as external blows, bruises, contusions, infiltrations of serum in the extremities, or long continued distention caused by a subjacent tumour, will alter, disorganize, and even annihilate animal contractility. 3rdly. Whenever the blood ceases to flow to the muscles, these organs are incapable of mo- tion. Stenon has observed, and I have always re- marked it myself, that by tying the aorta above its separation into the common iliacs, paralysis of the lower extremities is instantly produced. It is sufficiently known that in the operation of aneu- rism, a numbness, more or less considerable, con- stantly attends the application of the ligature. This state is continued until the collateral branches act as substitutes to the artery, which no longer con- veys any fluid. The motion produced in the muscle by the contact of blood, is then an essen-

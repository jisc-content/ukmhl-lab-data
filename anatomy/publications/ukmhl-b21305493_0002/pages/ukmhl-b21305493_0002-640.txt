SEROUS SYSTEM. 698 where it is thick may be separated into cellular layers, But which can never, as the mucous mem- branes, be neatly divided into two or three parts. The action of cantharides applied over their external surface, first laid bare, for instance, over a part of an intestine outwardly secured in a living animal, will not, as upon the skin, raise a serous vesicle. I have frequently made this ex- periment. What is the immediate structure of this single sheet of the^nasesus membranes? Let us examine it. section r. Cellular Nature of the Serous Tissue. Every system, in general, forms, as we have seen, an assemblage. 1st. Of parts in common, which are especially the cellular tissue, blood vessels, exhalents, absorbents, and nerves, form- ing, as we have said before, the basis. 2dly. Of a particular fibre formed of a substance which is deposited within, for instance, of gelatine for the cartilages, of gelatine and phosphate of lime for the bones, of fibrine for the muscles, &c. The cellular tissue then, the blood vessels, and the nerves are the fabric of the organs, their differ- ence depending upon their proper tissue, a tissue which itself depends upon a nutritive substance also proper to the organ. A bone would be con- verted into a muscle, if, without changing its

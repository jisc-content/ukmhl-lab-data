In fact, these small prolongations which are easily elevated, and bear the appearance of small threads, rather long, but nothing more than a kind of unevenness if left short, are all seen to take an oblique direc- tion, and to terminate in the pores that cross the dermis, in order, as I have said, to open on its surface. Their existence is sufficient at first glance, and without the assistance of the glass to distinguish the internal surface of this membrane from the external. The spaces that separate them are more or less extensive, and the connection is less on a level with these spaces. Over these are formed those numerous vesicles with which the skin is covered on being scalded. The depressed interstices which separate these vesicles, are the parts to which the exhalents that pre- vented the epidermis from rising, correspond : these also separate when ebullition is long con- tinued. It cannot be doubted that all these vascular prolongations must effectually help to unite the epidermis with the corium. I am not aware how that adhesion is effected in the interspace, but it actually exists, and, as I have previously stated, the cellular tissue does not appear to interfere with it. Every one knows that a variety of causes will destroy the adhesion of the epidermis, and raise it. These causes are: 1st. Every acute inflain-

These areolaÂ© display a multiplicity of apertures scattered near together, the major part of which contain small lumps of fat con- nected with the adjacent cellular tissue, and leav- ing, when removed, evident vacancies. The fibres that compose them are sufficiently con- tracted together to induce us to believe, on a cursory glance, that it resembles a sieve spread under the skin. In the hand and the foot, on the contrary, especially towards the heel, it forms a real net, the meshes of which present more sur- face than the fibres by which they are formed. Here it is quite the reverse. Let this be as it may, these areolae of the internal surface of the corium are remarkably useful in tanning, by which process this tissue, on account of these in- numerable openings, is more readily premeated on the fleshy side than in the opposite one. I have ascertained this fact in the human corium, which I had got tanned for the purpose. Chaptal has properly observed, that the epidermis was actually an obstacle to the process of tanning, and that for this purpose it is necessary to remove this covering, since it suffers the skin to be per- meated on both sides; but even then it is more

DEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. 779 other. When this transition is abrupt, most ge- nerally different organs are deranged, because the fluids intended to be expelled, cannot possibly vary with the same rapidity in their direction towards such and such an organ, as the cutaneous excitement produced by the abrupt transition from heat to cold. 4thly. The skin resists degrees of temperature much better than that of the body ; it opposes an insurmountable obstacle to external caloric, which tends to form the equipoise as well in living bodies as in inert forms. Thus whilst these are impreg- nated with this fluid in an atmosphere superior to their own, they soon acquire the same degree of temperature, however much the surrounding air is superior to their own. The interesting experi- ments of the English physicians have in respect to the human species cleared this of all doubts. It is needless to repeat the particulars of the experi- ments in which mercury has been seen to sink in the barometer when the ball was placed in the mouth, and the skin to cover itself, in a stove, with the aqueous vapours of the air condensed by the proportional cold of the body upon its surface, &c.: the considerations respecting animals pos- sessed of cold blood, living in warm climates, prove the very same thing. I shall remark in this respect, that most reptiles, the temperature of which is much colder than that of the mam- maliae and birds, and which consequently ap-

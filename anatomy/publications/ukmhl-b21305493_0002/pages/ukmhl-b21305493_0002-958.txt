916 EPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. ciency of internal motion in the epidermis; in respect to the habitual elaboration of nutrition and decomposition, constituting the insensibility of those organs to the various stimulants, is the facility with which they admit of being im- pregnated with the divers colouring substances, and retain them for such a length of time. In the historical accounts of the various savage tribes, we read that many of them are in the habit of staining their faces, or â–  other parts of the body, nay, even its whole surface, which retains for a considerable time without renewing the application, the colour that has been artifici- ally applied. I have stripped its epidermoidal part from the arm of a corpse, which, during life had in part been dyed blue; this shade not only pre- vailed over the surface of the membrane, but penetrated completely through : still the pores were as visible as before, and prespiration, I suppose, is effected as usual, with the tribes that dye their skin.

If any organ whatever be exposed and thus dyed, the colour will irritate, and togethe rwith the con- tact of the air, will produce inflammation, which being succeeded by suppuration the colouring mat- ter isexpelled. A similar effect would be produced by the process of nutrition if inflammation were not

Elephantiasis, and in general a number of chronic cutaneous diseases seem to me to rank amongst them : in acute diseases the corium even is apparently never affected in the first instance. The obscurity of its vital powers, its dense and light texture, its being almost destitute of blood vessels, will admit of chronic affections only. In phleg- monous erysipelas, in boils, &c., this organ is merely influenced, but not essentially diseased. Thus have we found every affection of the bony, cartilaginous, fibrous* fibro-cartilaginous systems, &c. especially assume a chronic type, owing to the texture and obscurity of the vital powers in these, systems. Now, if we reflect ever so little upon this divi- sion of cutaneous diseases, we shall find that, ex- cepting those of the first class, which are not very numerous, and consist in an increase or dimi- nution of the animal sensibility; we shall find, I say, that all the other affections consist in a more or less disordered state of organic sensibility, and corresponding insensible contractility.

To these various changes, also, must be referred the exuberance or deficiency of perspiration, the divers exudations effected through the skin ; in fact, the structure of the exhaients remain in- variably the same.

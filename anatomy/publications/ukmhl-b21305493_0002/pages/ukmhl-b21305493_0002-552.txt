Thus, the moment the nitric acid, a substance most generally used as a poison by the lower class, (as it is sufficiently proved by the practice of the Hotel Dieu); the moment, 1 say, the nitric acid comes in contact with the ali- mentary passages, they are disorganized by it ; it causes a white escar, which, when death (as is most frequently the case) is not an immediate consequence, is slowly removed and separated in the form of a membrane. We are well aware, that being slightly rubbed with very dilute nitric acid, the lips are affected by an insupportable throbbing, whilst frequently no pain is expe- rienced, although that acid has so effectually acted upon the skin, as to dye its exterior surface of a yellow colour. The softness of the mucous corion induces me to believe it is easily affected by the gastric juices; not that I credit Hunterâ€™s experiments on this head, who pretends these juices are power- ful enough to corode even the very membrane that produces them ; but because I have noticed, that every tissue which like this readily yields to maceration, is also very easily digested. I have, besides, no experiment to produce in re- spect to this tissue, and we are perfectly aware, that in the animal economy analogy is not al- ways a safe guide. Every mucous surface, but particularly those of the stomach and intestines, have the property

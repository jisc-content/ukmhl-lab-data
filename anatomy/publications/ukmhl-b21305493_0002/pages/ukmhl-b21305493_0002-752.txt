*710 GLANDULAR SVM The blood contains the materials of all the secre- tions of the nutrition and exhalation of every or- gan. Each gland drawsfrom that common reservoir what is required for its secretion, as each organ borrows from it what suits its nutrition, and as each serous surface selects what serves for exhalation. Now it is by its peculiar mode of organic sensi- bility that each living part in the economy thus distinguishes what its functions require. On the fluids approaching the small vessels of the gland, this sensibility is the sentry that warns, and insensible contractility, the agent that opens or shuts the doors of the organ, accordingly as the principles must be admitted or rejected. Let me be allowed this simile, it conveys an idea of what takes place. The whole glandular action then depends upon these two properties, and as this action is, as if were, permanent, they are incessantly in action. Hence, every glandular affection must necessa- rily imply a disordered state of these properties; for as we have often seen, it is the change of properties that predominates in an organ, the exercise of which constitutes its peculiar life, which especially produces disease. This in fact is displayed by common observation. Here, we see these properties increased or lessened, produce sometimes an abundant secretion, as in diabetes, salivation from mercury, immoderate fluxes of bile, &c.; on other occasions there is a diminution, a sus-

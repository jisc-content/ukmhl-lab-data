408 MUSCULAR SYSTEM lacerations of the diaphragm, but hardly one of the stomach, the intestines, and the heart, are mentioned. SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Muscular System of Organic Life. The cellular tissue is, when generally consi- dered, more sparingly distributed in the muscles of organic life than in the others. The fibres of the heart are much more in juxta-position than united by that tissue ; it is rather more apparent in the gastric and urinary muscles: scarcely any is met with in the womb; hence these muscles are never, like the preceding, infiltrated in drop- sies ; they never display that greasy state we have mentioned, in which the fibres are, as it were, imbedded ; nor have I ever remarked in these muscles, that yellowish hue frequently ob- served in the other fibres, particularly in those of the vertebral notches. The blood-vessels are much more numerous in this system, and even proportionally than in the others ; consequently they are supplied with a greater quantity of blood. This fact is parti- cularly remarkable in the intestines, where the mesenteric arteries supply a remarkable thin layer with a profusion of ramusculae: but I ob-

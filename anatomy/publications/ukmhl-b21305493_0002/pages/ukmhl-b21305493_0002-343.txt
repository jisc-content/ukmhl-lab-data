There are but few systems in the economy, in which the vital properties, and those of the tissue, are more energetic and striking than in Ihis. To convey a correct and precise idea of these pro- perties, the muscles should be selected. Their physical properties, on the contrary, are very obscure ; they are characterized by a remarkable softness, and a want of elastic power in their tis- sue. They have scarcely any resistance whatever after death, and it is only during life they borrow that degree of energy by which they are charac- terized. SECTION i. Properties of the Tissue, Extensibility. Extensibility in the muscular system of ani- mal life is developed in numerous instances. The different motions of the body display this property in its strongest light. Such is in fact the state of the muscular system, that one of its parts cannot be contracted without the other being distended. The flexion of the thigh necessarily causes an elon- gation of the semi-nervous, the semi-tendinous, and the biceps muscles. By stretching the arm

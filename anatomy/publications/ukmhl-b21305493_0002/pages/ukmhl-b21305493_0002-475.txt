433 OF ORGANIC LIFE. lio changes; but as these substances are liable to innumerable varieties, the organs preserving the same mode of organic sensibility experience fre- quent changes in their motions. At the moment chyle penetrates the blood during digestion the pulse alters, because the heart is differently excited. A similar phenomenon, but which varies, is observed; 1st. In re-absorp- tions, when pus passes into the mass of the blood ; 2dly. In the injection of different fluids into the veins,â€”injections so frequently repeated in the last century, when experiments on transfusion were practised, which experiments I have also per- formed, but with other views, that will be pointed out; 3dly. In inflammatory diseases, wherein the blood assumes a peculiar character, still but imperfectly ascertained, and which causes the cupped appearance, &c.; 4thly. In various other affections in which the nature of that fluid is astonishingly altered; 5thly. In the passing of the arterial blood into the veinous system, I have ascertained, that by adapting on one side a curved tube to the carotid of rather a large dog, and the other end to the jugular of the opposite side, in such a manner that the blood might be con- veyed from one vessel into the other, the passage of the red blood into the veins is not mortal, as that of the dark blood in the arteries; but in ge- neral, the first moments are marked by an acce- leration in the motions of the heart.

52 OSSEOUS SKSTEM. is, as T have just observed, remarkable amongst those that distinguish the other organs, for its % torpor, and the slow developement of its phe- nomena. Every thing in respect to age, to the different proportions of earthy and cartila- ginous substances being similar, inflammation is slower in its progress than in any other part. The formation of callus is more tedious than in other cicatrices : if we only compare an exostosis in its origin and progress with the formation of a tumour in the soft parts, with phlegmon for in- stance, the difference is striking. Who is not aware, that whilst in the other organs the process of suppuration frequently requires only a few days, in bones several months are necessary ? Let us observe the difference between gangrene of the soft parts, in which case death takes place after a very short interval, with caries and necrosis of bones, which require a long period for their com- pletion. It may be said on this account, that when seated in the bone, inflammation is chronic. Sympathies. This character of the vital properties imparts a similar one to the sympathetic connections of the osseous system with those of the other systems. First, animal contractility, and sensible organic contractility, could not be brought to act in these connections, since they do not exist in

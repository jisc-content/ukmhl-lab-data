OSSEOUS SYSTEM. I 64 in O l-H H <1 Q ►—4 H < < Table of the Articulations. CLASSES. I. Moveable. ORDERS. I. With ^ surfaces. contiguous < ii. Immoveable. II. With continued surfaces. f . l- ! With surfaces in i . juxta-position. II. \ With indented surfaces. III. With implanted surfaces. GENERA. l. General opposi- tion, circumduction, and rotation. II. General opposi- tion and circumduc- tion. m. Limited opposi- tion. IV. Rotation. V. Gliding. After having thus divided the articulations, let us produce, in respect to each class, a few general considerations; but let us previously observe that the preceding table, considered in respect to the moveable articulations, with contiguous sur- faces, clearly shews how very much these articu- lations are liable to luxations, which are more frequent in proportion as the motions are more extensive. The first genus is the more liable to this accident; the second the least so; the others.

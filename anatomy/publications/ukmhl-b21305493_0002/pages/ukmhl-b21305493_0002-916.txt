Its yellowish hue turns very dark, and when coagulated by cold, it requires very intense and long continued heat to reduce it to a liquid state : the fibrous portion of the dermis, which never melts, or at least resists a long time, is proportionally much more considerable. It is the same as in respect to bones, wherein the gluten is in a reverse pro- portion, and the earthy part in a direct one with age. Like every other tissue, that of the dermis becomes dense and tough ; it can no longer be used as food ; it would resist the tooth. When it has been tanned it is much more resistant, less supple, and on that account, cannot be applied to the same uses as that of young animals. Every body knows the difference between calfs-leather and ox-leather, especially if the latter be rather old. Their difference first proceeds from thick- ness, which being more considerable in the latter prevents its being so easily bent in various di- rections: then from the very nature itself of the tissue. If a hide be divided horizontallv; each half will be as thick as the undivided calf skin, and yet it will not be so supple. Of course this must be in the same state with regard to tanning, t&C. &c.

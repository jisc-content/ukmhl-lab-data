Thus it is that the serous membranes con- tribute indirectly to the nutrition and growth of their respective viscera; but they have never any direct influence over nutrition, because their organization and vitality differ from the vitality and organization of these organs. The free surface of the serous system, essen- tially differs from that of the mucous, in its dispo- sition to form adhesions. The pleura, above all, is that in which these adhesions are the most striking. Dissections prove that there are nearly as many instances of its existence, as of the contrary state. Next in rank com.es the perito- neum, then the pericardium, subsequently the tunica vaginalis testis; and finally, the tunica arachnoides is that which is less frequently found to contract adhesions, although I have seen some instances of it. These adhesions, which may be perfectly investigated in the pleura, admit of considerable varieties, which are as fol- lows : 1st. Sometimes the costal and pulmonary parts are so completely identified with each other, not

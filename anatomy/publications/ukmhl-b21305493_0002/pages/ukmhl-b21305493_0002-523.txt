OF ORGANIC LIFE. 481 The organic muscles do not seem liable to those irregularities of growth so frequently ascertained in the other muscles and in bones. We are aware that the stature will often remain stationary for some years, and then suddenly undergo a very considerable and rapid increase: this phenome- non is particularly striking subsequent to long diseases. Notwithstanding all these differences, the heart and every other analogous muscle grows uniformly; the regularity of the functions to which these muscles especially contribute would not accord with those aberrations which affect the organs of locomotion. Besides, were they to take place, circulation, digestion, the excretion of urine, &c. would be similarly affected ; but this is never observed. The heart and the gastric mus- cles keep growing whilst the size of the child re- mains stationary ; they do not suddenly increase in the youth when growth is so rapid. This ex- plains why the chest and abdomen are so spa- cious in il e first instance, in proportion to the limbs, and remain contracted in the second. Be^des, in these two systems, nutrition and power are never in equal portions. I have already observed, that very powerful organic muscles are frequently connected with a remarkable weak- * ness of the voluntary muscles, and thus recipro- cally. Let us not then consider growth and nutrition in an uniform manner. Each system has its pe- VOL. II. i j

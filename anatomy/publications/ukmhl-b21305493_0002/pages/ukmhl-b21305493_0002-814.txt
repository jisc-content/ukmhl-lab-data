From all that has been stated, it is evident that we might thus distinguish two portions in the ca- pillary system exterior to the corium ; 1st. The one is habitually filled with the colouring sub- stance of the skin, a substance that, like that of hair, appears to be stationary, let the description be what it may, &c. which is liable only to the slow and imperceptible progress of composition and decomposition, and in which that sudden in- crease and diminution we have noticed are never observed ; 2dly. The other is habitually overrun with a variety of fluids incessantly succeeding each other, and uninterruptedly exhaled by per- spiration, which may however be replaced by the blood invading that part of the capillary system. These two portions are completely independent of each other, and probably there is even no kind of communication between them. It appears that at the moment of death, there remains a certain quantity of white fluids in the latter portion of the exterior capillary system ; it is proved by the following experiment which I have repeatedly made ; by dipping a piece of skin in boiling water, and suffering it to remain there a few moments, the epidermis rises, not wholly as in blistering, but in the form of numerous

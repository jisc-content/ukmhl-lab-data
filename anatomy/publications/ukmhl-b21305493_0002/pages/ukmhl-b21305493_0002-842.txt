DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 800 length of time. In cases of elephantiasis, I have detected the complete disorganization of this tex- ture. Thillaye has submitted to my inspection por- tions of the skin dug out of the cemetery, in which every thing filling the areolae of the dermis had entirely disappeared, and wherein the areolae and their dried fibres actually formed a kind of membraneous sponge, admitting light in every direction. This instance proved quite the re- verse of what is observed subsequent to long con- tinued maceration, in which the adipose cellular texture, converted into a solid and whitish sub- stance, retains, as I have already stated, the form of the areolae, while the fibres of the dermis, re- duced to a pulpy state, were easily removed. In the first instance the mould only was preserved, in the second it was the contained substance only. In leucophlegmatia of long standing, the sub- cutaneous serum, infiltrating by degrees, through the cellular projections of the areolae of the der- mis, distends their fibres and consequently increases their capacity, and pften extends as far as the epidermis, which gives way in several parts, and through the crevices of which the serum escapes. In this instance, the skin is not dissolved as has been asserted, into cellular tissue, but distention exists between the fibres of the dermis which are not detsroyed.

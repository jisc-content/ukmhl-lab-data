692 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. lamella?, tat is never found accumulated in their parenchyma. The adipose state of the liver, a state exemplified in a variety of diseases, but which is not, as was thought, an essential con- comitant of phthisis, displays a phenomenon quite different from the breast and salivary glands, when loaded with fat. The fat then forms one of the elements of the texture; in this respect it is what the colouring matter was for which it has been substituted; it is not found in the cel- lulse. It may also be extracted by ebullition, and I have remarked that the water in which such livers are boiled contains a considerable quantity of it upon the surface. The kidney also contains fat internally; but this is deposited around the pelvis, and not in its parenchyma. The tonsils, the prostate gland, the mucous glands, &c. never contain any. The serum is not extravasated in the tissue of glands with a dense parenchyma; leucophlegmasia, when very general, does not affect them. However, we cannot doubt that the cellular tissue exists in these glands ; it is demonstrated by maceration. In the fungous tumours which spring up, we find a considerable quantity ; it is chiefly about the vessels that it exists; the capsule of Glisson presents an example. Frequently even it happens, as I have pointed out, that this tissue becomes diseased, that of the gland remaining healthy. We also find that steatomatous tumours

280 MUSCULAR SYSTEM The muscular tissue is remarkable for its soft- ness and want of resistance. This is what essen- tially distinguishes it from the fibrous tissue. It is easily ruptured in the corpse, but not without difficulty in the living subject, because the state of contraction produced by violent exertions, provides it with a degree of density from which it borrows a considerable power of resistance, of which it is deprived as soon as that state of contraction is discontinued. There are, however, some instances of rupture in muscles; they have chiefly been observed in the straight and square muscles of the abdomen. In the latter I have seen one myself. We should notice, that this mus- cle, and all those situate between the ribs and the pelvis, have from their situation a great tendency to become ruptured. In fact, whenever the pelvis and the chest are bent in opposite directions, these muscles are more violently stretched, be- cause in such motions the whole upper part of the body, in common with the chest, acts as a very powerful lever, which moves in a reverse sense to another powerful lever, formed by the pelvis and all the inferior parts. Now these levers, consi- dering their extent, are capable of a very consi- derable motion, consequently of communicating it to the abdominal muscles that are stretched between, and serve to unite them. This ex- plains why the quadratus of the left side may be ruptured by a violent inclination of the right, &c.

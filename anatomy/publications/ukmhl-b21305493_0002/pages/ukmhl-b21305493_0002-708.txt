666 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. vided with a membrane, as the liver, the kidneys, or even the pancreas, are less exposed to these irregularities than such as are unprovided with this, and imbedded in cellular tissue, as the sali- vary, the lachrymal, the mucous glands, <&c. I have frequently examined the latter in the mouth, and along the trachea, and never found them alike in two subjects. We are well aware that some- times the parotid gland extends over the masseter, that at other times it leaves it bare, that it is more or less continued over the neck, and is in that part of greater or less width, &c. Whenever one of the glands is wanting, or when one of them is diseased, the other is some- times considerably increased, as I have observed in the kidneys* This also happens in the treatment of fistula lachrymalis, by compression, a mode of treatment which is not always attended with success. In other instances the healthy gland is seen to increase its action, and separate more fluid, without becoming larger. The exterior of glands that are not provided with membranes are uneven and granulated; they correspond to muscles, vessels, nerves, and even to bones, such as the parotids that lay over the maxillary branches; in general they are sur- rounded with less cellular tissue than those in- tended to perform extensive motions; that which is directly in contact with them, is also tighter and denser than what is contained in the organic

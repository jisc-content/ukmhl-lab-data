116 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. thus laid open, the part that lined the socket unites with the membrane of the mouth, is con- tinued with it, and adheres at the same time to the ridge in the most intimate manner ; and as during the formation of the root, the internal surface of this membranous portion, at first per- fectly free, as we have seen, has gradually become strongly attached to it, it follows, that this root is incased between the part belonging to the socket that lines it outwardly, and the pulpous part that lines the interior : this is what secures its solidity. In proportion as the adhesions of the membrane increase, it is more difficult to distin- guish. In the first dentition, the formation of the root is very seldom so completely effected as in the second; its internal cavity is also much wider, and the pulp is larger. Second Dentition considered previous to the Protrusion. The nutritive phenomena ought, as in the preceding case, to be distinguished in those pro- duced previous to, during and subsequent to the eruption. Before this event, on opening the jaw, a row of teeth like follicles is noticed. It corresponds with the row of teeth already formed, either under them or sideways, and separated from them by small partitions, which are thicker i 2

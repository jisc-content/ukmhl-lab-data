GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 680 tubes are never seen to open over their serous and synovial membranes, the excretory ducts of the pretended articular glands would be, (if they existed) an exception to the law of the general organization. The excretory ducts never open into the cellular tissue. If this happen to be ac- cidentally the case, either collections supervene, from irritation, such as in urinary fistulae, or callosities form along the track of the excreted fluid, and thus protect the cellular system from fatal infiltration. Hence, the mucous tube of the intestines should be considered as a kind of general excretory organ superadded to the hepatic, pancreatic . excretory ducts, &c., expelling outwardly in a mass all fluids individually poured within its tube by these organs. In fact, all secreted fluids seem as I have said, intended to be expelled from the body. Separated from the mass of the blood, they are heterogeneous to it, and never re-enter the circulation in the natural state. Although still contained within the cavities of the mucous sur- faces, they may actually be considered as exter- nal. These surfaces, in fact, are internal in tigu- / ments, intended to protect the organs from the contact of the substances they contain, a contact which would necessarily prove fatal.

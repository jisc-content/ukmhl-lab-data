To the slowness of the motion of decomposition, must be attributed the re-solution of congestions in cartilages; for tumours are resolved by the same laws by which our organs are decomposed, as they are formed by the laws that preside over their composition. Cartilages, and similar organs, in respect to their mode of vitality, are to the other parts of the economy, what the zoophites and other animals possessed of capillary circulation only, are to ani- mals better organized, to those possessed of ge- neral circulation, to those provided with a heart of two ventricles.

Developement of the Cartilaginous System. The system of the bones, and that of the car- tilages, are confused together in the embryo ; in proportion as the first expands, the second con- tracts; the latter actually has gelatine for its prin- cipal basis.

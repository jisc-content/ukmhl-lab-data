MUCOUS SYSTEM. 634 ntlt. Whenever the stomach fills, the vessels' ramifying* over its external surface, are more ob- vious than when it is empty. The internal mu- cous surface is not redder, it has even sometimes appeared to me less so; *?,dly. The epiploon, less extended when the stomach is full, presents nearly the same number of apparent vessels, quite as long, but more tortuous than when it is in the contrary state. If then, they are less gorged with blood, the difference is of little importance. I have observed, that to distinguish this properly, particular care should be taken on opening the animal, that the blood does not fall upon the epiploon which first presents itself, and would thus prevent us from ascertaining the state it is in. This, besides, is an unavoidable consequence, resulting from the disposition of the vascular system of the stomach. In fact, the great coro- nary branch of the stomach being interposed transversely between this organ and the epiploon, and supplying them both with branches, it is evi- dent, that when the stomach, by separating the lamillae of the epiploon, forces itself between them and this, by investing that organ, becomes shorter; it is evident, I say, the branches it re- ceives from the coronary artery cannot also en- compass it: to admit of this, would require they should project from the one to the other without tlie interference of the trunk that divides them in

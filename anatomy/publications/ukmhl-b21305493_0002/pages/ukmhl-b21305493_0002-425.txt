I have repeated the same experiments on small guinea-pigs before they were born, by irritating directly the muscles, or exciting their nerves, spi- nal marrow, and brain. The nearer we are to the moment of conception, the less are the mo- tions produced. A very remarkable peculiarity, is the rapidity with which the moment the foetus is dead, the muscles lose their irritability. At the same instant in which life is extinguished, this pro- perty is annihilated. In the last days previous to delivery it is rather more permanent and more readily I flight into play, but still less so than after birW, and it cannot then be doubted that the motions though existing are less at that age. We shall find that in the adult, the nutrition, the volume, and colour of the muscles, are in general proportionate with the number of motions they are intended to perform ; we ought not then to be surprized if they are penetrated with less blood in the foetus; besides, the nearer we ap- proach the instant of conception, the less abun- dant is the fluid. I have had occasion to make this remark on guinea-pigs killed at different pe- riods of breeding. At first the muscles of the young are in reality similar to those of frogs, whitish like these, they are over-run with small reddish lines which trace the course of the vessels. I presume also, the species of blood circulated

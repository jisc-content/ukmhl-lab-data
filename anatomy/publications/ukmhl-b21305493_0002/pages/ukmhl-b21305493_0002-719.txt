GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 677 Although the first and second species of glands have no reservoirs, the divers ramusculas, how- ever, of their excretory ducts, may in some degree be considered as such. In fact, these ramusculse, as well as those of the excretory ducts of the glands, provided with a reservoir, are habitually filled with the fluid secreted from these organs. Whatever may have been the nature of the death, the fluid of the prostrate gland may always be expressed by compressing the gland. I have even frequently squirted it out by compression. By pressure also the urine may always be forced from the kidneys. Pure bile is also seen oozing from the hepatic divi- sions when the liver is cut in slices. Semen is constantly found in the folds of the vas deferens. Milk stagnates in the cavities of the lacteal ves- sels, until it is evacuated; there is even no other reservoir for this fluid. The greater or less size of the breast during lactition proceeds only from these ducts being more or less full, &c. To this circumstance may even be referred the taste pe- culiar to each glandular tjssue, which constantly borrows some sapid particles from the fluid it separates. The kidneys, as is well known, have always a smell of urine, especially if taken from an aged animal, &c.

71 OSSEOUS SYSTEM* motion is always performed more readily in one direction than in the others ; for instance, in the elevation and depression of the jaw, the flexion and extension of the first phalanges, of the wrist, &c.: there are in general two lateral ligaments and a capsule where the motions are the most re- stricted ; a capsule only, where they are more ex- tended. Third Genus. In proportion as we advance in examining the modes of articulation, we find the extent of mo- tion is lessened. In this there is less opposition in different directions, and of circumduction, which always implies an undefined opposition. Here this opposition is constantly limited to one direc- tion, to that of flexion and extension for in- stance. This kind of articulation is peculiar to the mid- dle of the limbs, as the elbow, the knee, towards the middle of the fingers in the articulations of the phalanges. Although the bones which compose them below only move in one direction, yet they borrow general motions from the superior articu- lation of the limb, and by that means may be va- riously directed. The articulating surfaces are found here, as in the preceding genus, situate at the extremity of the bone, having the axis in common with that

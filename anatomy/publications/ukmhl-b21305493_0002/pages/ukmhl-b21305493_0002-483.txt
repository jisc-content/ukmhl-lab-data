Every heterogeneous substance introduced in the circulation will produce this phenomenon. Urine, which maintains in har- mony the motions of the bladder, would disturb those of the heart, if it be circulated in its cavi- ties. The blood, apparently milder than urine, might occasion spasm of the bladder, if deposited in that organ. I have attended, with Desault, a patient long affected with retention of urine, and from whom he had extracted a very large stone. Subsequent to the operation, the urine stagnated in the bladder as long as the former remained pure ; but the moment a little blood found its way into the organ, it caused involuntary contraction, and the bloody urine was expelled. The faeces, which remain for some time in the rectum with- out causing contraction, would instantly act upon the stomach, &c. All these phenomena also rally around the varieties of sensibility in the mucous membranes, varieties to which we shall return. They evidently prove that each individual muscle is possessed of a degree of organic contractility peculiar to it, and upon which certain fluids only in the animal economy can act with regularity. Heterogeneous fluids give the same result: eme- tics, which cause the stomach to contract, might be injected into the bladder with impunity ; pur- gatives cause no vomiting, &c. This connection

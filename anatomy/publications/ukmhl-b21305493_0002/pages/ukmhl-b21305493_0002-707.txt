GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 605 to anatomy. The following means place this fact in the strongest light. It is sufficiently known that the organs vary astonishingly in different in- dividuals : now, in these varieties, the proportions in animal life are ever the same, whilst in organic life they are rarely exact. Let us, for example, take an organ in each of these. I have constantly observed, that in a small brain the corpora callosa, the thalami nervorum, opticorum, <&c. are in pro- portion to the entire volume of the organ. Nothing, on the contrary, is more common than to find the lobulus spigelii united to a small liver, and, reciprocally, a large liver to a small lobe. This remarkable observation must have struck every anatomist. Sometimes a kidney is larger at its upper than at its lower part, or the contrary. In animal life, these varieties of volume relate to the entire organ ; in organic life, frequently to isolated parts. The reason appears to me to be, that harmony of action is indispensable for the animal functions : so that if one side of the brain were more fully developed than the other ; if one eye, one ear, one pituitary membrane, &c. were more characterized than its corresponding organ, understanding, sight, hearing, smell, &c. would necessarily be impaired, whilst the secretions of bile , urine, &c. may be perfectly effected, although one part be larger or smaller than the others. With respect to the glands, there is one circum- stance worthy of notice, which is, that those pro-

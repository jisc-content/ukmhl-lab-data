GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 6G8 which they are distinguished from the cartilage, wherein the fracture is even. All the glands can- not be divided with equal facility. The prostate, the tonsils, the mucous glands, are much more re- sistant than the liver and kidneys, wherein this phenomenon is essentially produced. The pan- creatic and the salivary glands yield slightly ; but this does not proceed from their tissue, but from the abundant cellular tissue they contain. Their different lobes are then placed at greater distances, in proportion as the intermediate filaments be- come longer. The glandular tissue, very commonly called parenchyma, is in general disposed in three diffe- rent ways; 1st- In the pancreas, the salivary and la- chrymal glands, the lobes are separated by a quan- tity of cellular tissue, resulting from smaller lobes, and which are conglomerated; and these are formed from still smaller lobes, termed glandular grains. The first, second, third, and even fourth divisions, are easily followed by the knife ; 2dly. In the liver and kidneys, no signs whatever of the first, and even second divisions, can ever be traced ; no principal nor secondary lobe can be observed. All the glandular grains are in juxta- position, separated by an equal quantity of cellu- lar tissue, very small in quantity, as we shall find, present an uniform and even tissue, easily sepa- rated, as I have said, and granulated in its frac- tures ; 3dly. The prostate, the tonsils, all the

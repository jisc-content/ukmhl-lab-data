I have merely observed, that whatever is not arterial blood, the dark blood, and even serum, cause death when propelled through the carotids ; water only is inoffensive. When irritating fluids are diluted with a great quantity of blood, their contact is not so fatal. I have seen light coloured urine in- jected without causing death. Structure of the Excretory Ducts. All the excretory tubes are provided with an nterior membrane, which is mucous, and which is a continuation of the mucous or cutaneous surface over which they terminate ; but besides this, all present an outward envelopement, as it were, of this mucous canal.

XIV ANALYSIS. Nerves.—Those of animal life almost exclusively met with.—How far they differ in the extensors an.d in the flexors.—In what manner nerves penetrate the muscles - 298 —300 ARTICLE III. Properties of the Muscular System of Animal Life. Sect. I.—Properties of Tissue - - 301 0 Extensibility.—This property is in continual exercise.—It is propor- tionate with the length of the fibres.—Its effects in diseases 301—304 Contractility.—Phenomena of the antagonist muscles.—Distinctions in these phenomena, in what belongs to the vital properties, from what proceeds from those of the tissue.—Of contractility of tissue in dis- eases.—Extent and rapidity of contractions.—They survive death itself.—Essential distinctions between the contractility of tissue and shrinking.—A parallel drawn between them - 304—314 Sect. II.— Vital Proper ies - - 314 Properties of Animal Life.—Sensibility.—Several agencies fail to excite sensibility. — It is brought into action by repeated con- tractions.—Of the sensation of weariness. —Sensibility of muscles in their affections - - 314—317 Animal Contractility.—It should be considered in three different respects - - 317—318 Animal Contractility viewed in the Brain.—The principles of this contractility rest in this organ.—Proofs drawn from observation.— Proofs deduced from diseases.—Proofs borrowed from experiments on animals—Of cases in which the muscles are not influenced by the brain - - 318—326 Animal Contractility viewed in the Nerves.—Influence of the spinal marrow upon this property.—Observations and experiments.—Every nerve does not equally transmit the divers irradiations from the brain. Direction of the propagation of nervous influence 326—331 Animal Contractility considered in the Muscles.—Conditions required for muscles to contract.—Obstacles to contraction.—Divers experi- ments ... 331—336 Causes that produce Animal Contractility.—A division of these causes.—Of will.—Of involuntary causes.—Direct excitement.—S.ym-

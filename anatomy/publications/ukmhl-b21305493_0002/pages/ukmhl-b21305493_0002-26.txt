First Variety.—Diversity of the Muscular Tissue.—Each muscle is especially connected with some determined substance.—This prin- ciple applied either to natural or artificial fluids 440—442 Second Variety.—sloe.—Vivacity of contraction in infancy.—Conse- quences.—A reverse p henomena in old age - 442—444 Third Variety.—Constitution.—Difference in individuals in respect to organic muscular power.—This power is never proportionate with animal muscular power.—Never will it like this last be encreased by practising - - 444— 446 Fourth Variety—The Sex - 446—447 Fifth Variety.—Season and Climate - 447 Sensible Organic Contractility, considered in Respect to the Aetionof the Stimulating Agents over the Organs.— On the intermediate agency habitually interposed to produce this effect.—The nature of this agency - - - 447—450 Sensible Organic Contractility, considered relative to its Permanence after Death.—This state varies according to the nature of the death.— Remarks - - 450—453 Sympathies.—Sympathies of the heart.—Sympathies of the stomach.— Remarks on bilious vomitings.—General considerations,—Sym- pathies of the intestines, bladder, &c. - 453—459 Character of the Vital Properties.—Vital energy highly characterized in this system.—Its affections bear upon its predominating vital power. —Affections which suppose a disordered state in the organic properties very scarce - - 459—461 ARTICLE IV. Phenomena of the Action of the Muscular System of Organic Life. Sect. I.—Power of Contractions.—Difference in the contracting power from the preceding.—In vital phenomena this power is greater than in experiments.—Calculations fail in this respect 462—465 Sect. II.—Rapidity of Contractions.—In experiments.—During life.— Compared with the rapidity in the preceding muscles 465—466 Sect. III.—Continuance of Contractions 466—467 Sect. IV.—State of the Muscles during Contraction.—Difference in this respect between the heart and the gastric muscles 467—469 Sect. V.—Motions produced by the Organic Muscles 469 Sect. VI.—Phenomena of the Relaxation of the Organic Muscles.—

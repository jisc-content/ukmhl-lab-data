EPIDKR MOIRA L SYSTEM. 881 these two small laminae, which being' pressed against each other when perspiration is suspended, conceal their apertures; but if perspiration be suddenly produced when in a very dry state/as from the effect of very hot beverages, for instance, then the small drops which proceed from the cutaneous surface, not having had sufficient time to spread into a moist layer, but being left iso- lated on the parts wherein they are observed, the orifices of the exhalents are detected. Besides, if a moderate portion of the epidermis be exa- mined in a favourable light, a multiplicity of small pores separated by interstices, and crossing its thickness in an oblique direction are observed. The soles of the feet and palms of the hand only, do not admit of them. It is absolutely impossi- ble to distinguish, between these pores, the ab- sorbents from the exhalents, even when mercury is forced by friction into the former. The internal surface of the epidermis is very firmly attached to the skin. The means of union are, first, the exhalents, absorbents, and the hair, which in crossing the former adhere to it more or less, and thus fix it to the latter from which they originate. On removing the epider- mis by maceration, which is the best means to preserve it uninjured, a multiplicity of small pro- longations of various extent, and which, on being examined with due attention, appear to be no- thing more than the divided ends of the exhalents 3 L VOL* JI.

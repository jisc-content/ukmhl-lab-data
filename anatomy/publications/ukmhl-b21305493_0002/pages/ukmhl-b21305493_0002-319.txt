If the mass they form by their assemblage be generally examined, it will be observed, this mass is sometimes further ex- tended than the tendinous part of the muscle, such as in the biceps, in the coraco-brachialis, in the rectus internus femoris ; that it is sometimes much shorter, as in the palmaris plantaris, &c. and on other occasions in nearly an equal propor- tion with it, as in the external radials, &c. If from this investigation we proceed to that of the individual fibres of which it is composed, the length of the former will seldom be found equal to that of the latter. There are scarcely any but the sartorius, and a few other similar muscles, in which the fibres are always seen to over-run the whole extent of the fleshy mass; in almost all the other muscles they are disposed in an oblique direction between two aponeuroses, or between a tendon and an aponeu* rosis; so that, although each of them are rather short, their assemblage forms a mass of some ex- tent, as is observed in the rectus anterior femoris, in the semi-membranous, &c. This disposition may also result from the different tendinous inter- sections which are placed at different distances in the course of the fibres. In general the mus- cles that derive their length from long fibres,

DERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 799 which transmit the vessels, nerves, and the hair, after they have crossed this portion of the cellular tissue. The corium then may be considered as a kind of spongy body, the interstices of which are formed by the areolae, and every part containing cellular tissue, in such a manner, that if it were possible to separate these areolae by dissection from the cellular tissue and other organs they are over-run with, a substance perforated in every direction might be obtained: in the performing which, art is likely to fail, considering the ex- cessive tenuity of the parts; but often where dissection fails, nature frequently succeeds. I have ascertained that in cases of furunculus, every thing that filled the interstices of the fibres of the dermis was expelled by suppuration, and that these fibres removed besides from each other by the swelling of the parts, actually displayed wThen cleaned of the fluid with which they are moist- ened,â€”that kind of perforated substance to which I allude. The furunculus, in fact, differs from a multiplicity of other cutaneous eruptions, inas- much as it seizes upon the cellular tissue of the areolae of the corium, whilst the latter are ex- clusively seated, as I have said, in the reticulated portion. I have not heard of any acute affection invading the corium itself, all, without exception, attack either its surface, or the cellular tissue of its areolae. Its dense and tight tissue appears unal- terable like that of the apeunoroses, except after a

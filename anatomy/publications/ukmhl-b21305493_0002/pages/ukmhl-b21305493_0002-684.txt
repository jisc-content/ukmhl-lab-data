042 SYNOVIAL SYSTEM. we shall find, on the one hand, 1st. a cylindrical bag with two wide openings to receive the ex- tremities of the bones, and several small ones for the vessels; 2ndly. A flbous interlacement similar to that of tendons, aponeurosis, &c. ; 3rdly. A mode of sensibility analogous to that of these organs: 4thly. The use of retaining firmly in their respective places the articulated bones, which have no other bond of union. On the other hand, we shall observe; 1st. An imperforated sac ; 2ndly. A cellular structure, similar to that of the serous membranes ; 3rdly. A sensibility of a similar nature ; 4thly. The single function of containing and separating synovia, the bones being secured by strong ligaments. The different re-agents exercise over the fibrous capsules, an influence quite distinct from that which operates upon the synovial membranes. By ebullition they become yellow, semi-transparent, soften like the tendons, and are gradually diffused into gelatine. The synovial membranes that have been boiled are left white, and produce hut little of this substance. I have even observed, that the yellow hue, and the semi-transparency of boiled fibrous capsules, is an infallible means of ascertaining which are the articulations provided with these organs, or those deprived of them. The presence of the synovial membrane in the articulations when in an isolated state, is obvious at the slightest glance ; and in those where it is

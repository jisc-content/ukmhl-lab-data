MUCOUS SYSTEM. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Mucous Systems., sectton r. Properties of the Tissue. Extensibility and contractility are more ob- scure in this system than they -would at first appear, on account of the numerous folds ob- served in the hollow organs during their con- traction, folds whicli merely open, as we have seen, during extension. In certain cases, how- ever, these two properties become very obvious. The excretory ducts admit of being much extended beyond their natural dimension. This phenome- non is particularly observed in the urinary duct which is sometimes seen as wide as an intestine. The ductus choledocus and the pancreatic duct present frequent instances of such dilatations. The urethra and salivary ducts seem less extensi- ble than the others : at the slightest obstacles from strictures, &c. they will sooner be lacerated than distended : hence the different fistuloe connected with these passages. There are then several va- rieties in the degrees of sensibility of the mucous system. These two properties, besides, are sus- ceptible of being rapidly brought into action. It

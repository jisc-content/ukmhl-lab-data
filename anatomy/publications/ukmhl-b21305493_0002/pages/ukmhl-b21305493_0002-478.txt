436 MUSCULAR SYSTEM Artificial Excitants. All substances are in general artificial excitants. Such is, in fact, the nature of organic contracti- lity, that if a muscle be in contact with a body it is not accustomed to, it will instantly contract. If the muscles are not irritated by the organs they are surrounded and connected with, it is be- cause habit has blunted the sensation arising from such connection ; but if the state of these organs be changed ; if they are separated from the body, allowed to cool, and then applied to the organic muscles laid bare, they will cause them to con- tract. Caloric, the absence of which constitutes cold, as its presence constitutes heat, will act in the same manner upon muscles, and in general upon every organ. The moment the chest and the pericardium of a living animal are laid open, the heart suddenly beats with additional force, be- cause air acts upon the organ. In the transition from the temperature of the body to another quite different, all aeriform fluids, all light li- quids, &c. are excitants for the muscles. When we observe the heart emptied of blood, the sto- mach and the intestines deprived of the substances they habitually contain, they contract more when they have been removed from the body; it is the surrounding atmosphere and the substances

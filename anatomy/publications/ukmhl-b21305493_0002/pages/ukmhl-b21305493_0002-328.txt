MUSCULAR SYSTEM 286 In all cases of cachexia, in which the blood is im- poverished, the pulse small and feeble, in which muscular nutrition has had time to suffer from a deficiency of fibrine in the blood, the muscles are small, weak, soft, &c. In general, the muscles and the blood are constantly in an uninterrupted connection, whilst other systems frequently pre- dominate, even when this fluid seems deficient in the economy. On undergoing continued ebullition, as the meat for instance boiled for our meals, the muscular tissue still adhering to the adjacent organs, to its parts in common, produces; 1st. An albuminous scum, which seems to depend more upon the lymph in the cellules, than upon the muscle itself; Sndly. Numerous small greasy drops also, especially proceeding from the cellular tissue, consequently nearly unconnected with that of the muscle, and floating over the surface ; 3rdly. Gelatine, par- ticularly formed by the aponeurotic intersections; 4thly. An extractive substance, which partly colours the liquid, gives it a peculiar flavour and remains partly adherent to the meat, to which it communi- cates a deep colour very different from that of raw meats,which depends upon the colouring substance of the muscle, and which besides changes when the meat is cooled, to a lighter and even to a whitish hue ; 5thly. Different salts, that impart to the liquid a flavour, which the chemists have noticed. Such are the natural effects of boiling the muscles.

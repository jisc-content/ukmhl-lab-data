It does not exhale any offensive smell, as a number of other tissues. Hence the skins of a number of animals merely dried answer a variety of purposes, savages use them as garments, &c. Aponeuroses, mucous, serous, and fibrous mem- branes, could not thus be turned to advantage. To this again must also be referred the perfect state of preservation of the interior parts of mum- mies, which could never have stood a succession of centuries, had a fleshy or serous layer, &c. been the envelopment. Whenever the skin is left on the corpse, or ex- posed to damp air, instead of drying, it putrefies; then it assumes a tarnished hue and subsequently a greenish appearance, and finally exhibits a black- ish aspect. Its effluvia is very offensive ; it swells and thickens from the gases that form in it inflating the cellular tissue of its areolae.

Now the transition from the natural to the accidental connection between the functions is marked by a multiplicity of vague symptoms, which proceed from sympathies, and amongst which the kind of shivering I allude to is the foremost. In the early stage of digestion, a kind of sym- pathetic cold over-runs the skin, which in general is quite as warm as usual. It is owing to the state of the stomach acting upon the cutaneous sensibi- lity, and giving rise to a particular sensation, dif- fering, no doubt, from that resulting from the same viscus when disordered, affecting the brain, causing head-aches, &c. but which proceed from the same cause. The sensation of heat is also frequently sym- pathetic, but less so, as I have before observed, than in the mucous system. We are familiar with those flushes of heat, which so often traverse the skin in many fevers, and which are not attended with any increase of caloric. Our modern physicians, perhaps, will hardly conceive how, wTiilst in most cases, a greater or less degree of caloric, than our habitual tempera- ture, is required to produce the sensations of heat or cold, these sensations may arise in a part, with- out its experiencing increase or diminution of temperature. But in most instances, does not pain also proceed from a material cause ? and yet in all sympathies it is produced without this cause.

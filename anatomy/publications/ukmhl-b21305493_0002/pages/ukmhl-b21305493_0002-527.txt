485 OF ORGANIC LIFE. *1 1 which, in a smaller scale, proceeds the weariness that attends the contraction of an isolated mus- cle. Less continued motion is required to fatigue the voluntary than the involuntary muscles. An empty stomach remains long contracted, without imparting any painful sensation, whilst, by grasp- ing any body for a quarter of an hour only, every flexor will very soon be painfully affected. Subsequent to a convulsion that has lasted half an hour, and stiffened every muscle belonging to locomotion, the whole frame is bruised, according to the vulgar expression : it admits of no motion : whilst after a fever of six or eight hours, during which the pulse has been violently agitated, the heart will often retain the natural type of its contractions; to weaken this organ requires a succession of fits. All these phenomena of the two muscular systems, evidently prove, that that of animal life is much sooner wearied ; this even causes intermission. Why should we wonder then, if although less active than the other, it sooner expends the sum of power nature has bestowed upon it ? Is it astonishing this should survive the last? Life is a grand exercise that, by degrees, destroys the moving organs, and finally com- mands rest ; that rest is death : each moveable organ dies sooner or later, according to the pow- ers which it has to expend, according to its greater or less tendency to be wearied by that exercise.

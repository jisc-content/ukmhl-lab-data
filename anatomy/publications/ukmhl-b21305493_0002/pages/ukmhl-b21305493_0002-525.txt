OF ORGANIC LIFK. 483 which variations rather correspond with those in the preceding system. Acute and chronic dis- eases have nearly the same influence upon them ; it also indicates, by its different shades, the san- guine and lymphatic constitutions, &c. The co- lour of the fibres of the stomach, of the intestines, and of the bladder, is less variable ; their general whitish aspect is less influenced by disease. We cannot, by habitual exercise, increase the nutrition of organic muscles. Excessive reple- tion, by causing the stomach to contract, fre- qently weakens the muscles instead of strength- ening them, as is the case when the limbs are kept in continued action : the bladder inces- santly acting in peculiar incontinencies, gradually weakens and loses its energy. It may be said these two systems are in quite a reverse state in this respect. It appears that the nutrition of organic mus- cles, as well as that of others, is liable to frequent variations, that sometimes they are better characte- rized, and at other times less so than usual. Diseases have a remarkable influence upon this phenome- non, which, as well as the softening of bones and their return to their natural order, proves the ha- bitual composition and decomposition carried on in our organs. In respect to the hue, density and cohesion of muscles, a thousand varieties are daily seen in our dissecting rooms. Now all the varie- ties we see at once, one individual has often expe- i i 2 /

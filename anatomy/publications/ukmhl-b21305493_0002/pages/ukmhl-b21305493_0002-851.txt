DEUMOJDAL SYSTEM. 809 sensibility in the lacteal absorbents of the intes- tinal tube be increased, instantly, but moment- arily, their action is suspended ; they cease to ab- sorb fluids, chyle, &c. and the whole is expelled through the anus. Now, innumerable causes in- cessantly act upon the skin; a multiplicity of irritating agents alternately operating upon this organ, unremittingly vary its degree of organic sensibility ; they increase or diminish it, and thus remove from it that degree required to effect ab- sorption. Should we wonder, then, at the va- rieties this function is liable to ? Several modem authors have brought forth against it negative facts. What is proved by these facts, unless the very varieties in the degrees of sensibility I am alluding to ? But they do not by any means in- validate that sum of facts universally avowed, and the amount of which forms a mass of sub- stantial and irresistible proof. Thus have the vital powers of the mucous surfaces been found to vary, owing to the variety of their stimulating agents, and, of course, in effecting absorption. If in the serous membranes and cellular tissue, during the elaboration of the organs, tiffs function remains permanently the same, it is owing to its being always in contact with the same substances that the surfaces in which it is effected have retained an invariable degree of organic sensibility. Numerous facts, particularly relating to con- tagion, appear to prove that debility promotes

826 DEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. contraction takes place in the natural state ; for if preceded by distention, the cells first widen, then contract to their original size, and there exists no disproportion, in extent, between the external and internal surfaces of the skin. The generality of extensions are attended with a reduction in the thickness of the tissue of the dermis. Its thickness is never increased, and its density at the same time diminished, but when, as in leucophlegmatia, its areolae are infiltrated with water. In chronic inflammation, obstruction, and in various alterations that have their seat in the dermis, it is partly deprived of the faculty of extending, and is easily torn on being dis- tended. This is often the case in aneurisms, par- ticularly in those by which the sternum has been perforated: a slow and gradual inflammation invades the skin that covers the tumour, and it breaks from a degree of distention much less than what it can support in its natural state, if not prevented by death ; of this I have seen ' two instances at the Hotel Dieu. In this state of inflammation the distention is excessively pain- ful, whilst it is attended with no pain at all in the natural state. In the greater part of chronic affections that are seated in the skin, this organ is also deprived of its contractile powers. Is the skin more braced at one time than at another, when it is left looser and more ex-

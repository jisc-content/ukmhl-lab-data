GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 713 in like manner, incessantly varying in diseases, the powers of the glandular life cause a rapid change in the different secretions. It is not only upon the process of secretion that the different alterations in the organic sensi- bility and insensible contractility of the glands act, these alterations when continued, influence nutrition also, and disturb its motions : hence the alterations in the tissue, the various kinds of tu- mours, the disorganizations, &c., so frequently met with in the glandular system, one of the most productive in supplying matter for pathological anatomy. The multiplicity of organic injuries which this system presents, when compared with the major part of others, is very striking in our dissecting rooms. This, the cutaneous, the mucous, the serous, the cellular, &e., rank the first in this respect. It may also be remarked that they are precisely those in which organic sensibility and insensible contractility are the most exquisite, because thev are the onlv ones wherein these are brought into play, not by nutrition only, but also by different other functions effected in the insensible capillary system, namely, by exhala- tion, absorption, and nutrition. Sympathies. Few systems are so frequently the seat of sym- pathies as this. In considering them I shall

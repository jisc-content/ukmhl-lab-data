general considerations. 3 taneous, fibrous, and mucous systems only, are every where continued in all their parts. And yet, in respect to the last, there is no communi- cation between that part extended over the organs of digestion and respiration, and that belong- ing to the urinary and genital organs. We have found, on the contrary, the primitive systems are every where continuous. The cellu- lar, the arterial, the veinous, the absorbant, the nervous, are so disposed, that if it were possible to remove every organ they overrun, and leave them separate, they would completely represent a whole, differently shaped according to these systems. The exhalants, as we have seen, may also be considered as every where extended. Let us suppose, on the contrary, that the organs inter- mediate to the bones, to cartilages, to the fibro- cartilage, are removed, all the parts of these sys- tems will instantly separate, and continuity will cease to exist. It is of little importance what order we follow in examining these systems; they shall be placed in succession to each other in the following series; that includes, 1st. The osseous system ; 2nd. The medullary; 3d. The cartilaginous; 4th. The fibrous; 5th. The fibro-cartilaginous; 6th. The muscular system of animal life; 7th. The muscu- lar system of organic life; 8th. The mucous sys- tem ; 9th. The serous; 10th. The glandular ; 11th# b 2

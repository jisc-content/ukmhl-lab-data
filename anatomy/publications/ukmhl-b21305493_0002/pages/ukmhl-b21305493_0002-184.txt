142 MEDULLARY SYSTEM. tion, and several other causes, the vascular system destroyed within the cavity, and wholly applied over the periosteum,deposits therein the calcareous substance intended for the bone. The bone with- in is a body unconnected with life, encompassed on all sides by a living body. In artificial ossifica- tions, there are then three very distinct periods. 1st, Swelling and inflammation of the periosteum. 2dly,The cartilaginous state of the internal lamellae of this membrane. 3dly, The state of perfect bone. Besides, the two last states are not so regular and distinct, nor so easily studied, as in natural os- sification. Is the medullary membrane indirectly intended to furnish a part of the synovia by a transudation of the marrow through the heads of the long bones? â€”the greatest part of authors have asserted it. The opinion we should entertain of these me- chanical transudations observed in dead bodies, but repugnant to the ascertained phenomena of vitality, is now sufficiently known; the follow- ing experiments, besides, will remove all manner of doubt in this respect. I have opened on the sides two long bones in one of the posterior limbs of a dog, so as to introduce a red hot iron, which having been repeatedly done, has com- pletely destroyed the two medullary systems: necrosis was an immediate result of this experi- ment; the articulation, however, interposed be-

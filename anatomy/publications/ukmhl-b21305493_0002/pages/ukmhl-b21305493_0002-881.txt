I divide these diseases into four classes, from the structure observed in the skin : â€” 1st. There are diseases belonging to the pa- pillae : such are palsies, and the increased sensibi- lity, which exclusively belong to the nerves. Females are particularly liable to the latter, which are so far extended in some nervous affec- tions, that a moderate pressure upon the skin will produce convulsions; to this also must be referred the excessive susceptibility observed in some in- dividuals, who on the slightest tickling expe- rience a general revolution. These elevations of animal sensibility, ought to be carefully distin- guished from those before stated, and which proceed from inflammation. In the latter, the organic sensibility is especially affected : one might think, that on being increased, it was con- verted into animal sensibility, whilst in the case I am alluding to, this last property only is increased. 2dly. There are diseases that are obviously seated in the cellular tissue of the areolae of the dermis: such are the inflammations of that por- tion of the cutaneous organ, by which a phlegmon, a furunculus, <fec., are covered. 3dly. Other affections belong to the exterior capillary net from which the exhalents originate. To this belong erysipelas, several species of erup- tions, measles, scarlatina, and a variety of other cutaneous affections daily met with in practice.

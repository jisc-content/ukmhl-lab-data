88 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. the progress of the exhalation of the earthy sub- stance is examined, a vascular layer, very red, interposed between the cartilage and the part of the ossified bone, is always seen. This layer seems to be a forerunner of the state of solid bone. Why is it, that the vessels of the bones, which till then only contained white fluids, begin to circulate red globules? It is not, as Boerhaave would have said, if he had studied os- sification, because their diameter is increased, but actually because the sum of their organic sensibi- lity increasing, they become then connected with the red portion. Their diameter might twice or three times exceed that of the red globules, but these will never penetrate them, if re- jected by the mode of organic sensibility, in the same manner as the larynx repels any sub- stance that tends to penetrate it, although this substance is much inferior in size to the glottis. It is by an increase of organic sensibility. It should also be explained why the bone, so far unconnected with the calcareous substance, and admitting of gelatine, also appropriates the first substance, and is easily imbedded with it. I shall only observe, there is this distinction between the exhalation of the one, and of the other, that the former always proceeds directly from the red part of the blood, since wherever it is deposited, there are, as I have stated, blood- vessels, whilst the latter appears to proceed im-

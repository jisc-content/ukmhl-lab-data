363 OF ANIMAL LIFE- proper estimation of the powers of an isolated muscle, of the deltoid for instance, the distance between its insertion and the point of resistance, the degree of opening of the angles formed by the fleshy fibres upon the tendon, and subsequently by the tendon upon the bone, with the distribu- tion of the powers between the fixed and the moveable points, should be particularly consi- dered. A few advantages seem with some muscles to compensate slightly for their unfavourable posi- tion for not admitting of powerful motion; such are; 1st. The sesamoid bones, the patella, the different prominences for insertion, the enlarge- ment of the long bones at their extremities, &c. by which the distance between the fibres and the moveable points is increased ; 2dly. The inter- muscular fat, that which surrounds the muscles, the fluid of the synovial sheaths which promotes motion by moistening the surfaces of the respec- tive organs; 3dly. The aponeurotic expansions which reflect the motions over the limbs; 4thly. The motion itself, that of flexion for instance, which gradually, as it takes place, lessens the ob- liquity of the insertion of the flexors, and even renders it perpendicular, as a modern author has judiciously observed. The losses sustained by the muscular motion, the exertion performed by a muscle on contract- ing, compared with the effect, have undergone

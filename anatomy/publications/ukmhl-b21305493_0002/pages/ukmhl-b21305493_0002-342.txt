300 MUSCULAR SYSTEM duced in the direction of flexion than in that of extension, which, however, is sometimes the case ; 2dly. The flexors in the aged subject finally ob- tain a predominance over the extensors; the fingers and toes for instance are most generally bent; 3dly. In every motion the power is in the sense of flexion. - \ â€¢ On penetrating the muscles, the nerves make very acute angles with the extremities, because the nervous trunks follow the natural direction of these organs. In the trunk, on the contrary, those proceeding from the spine, particularly the cervicals, on penetrating their muscles, make almost right angles, or at least the angles are not very acute : this circumstance is immaterial: each branch, on reaching the fleshy fibres, first divides, then subdivides in the interstices, and is lost in their tissue. Is each individual fibre supplied with a ner- vous ramification? From the following observation one might be induced to believe it; namely, that on the principal branch being irritated, every fibre comes into play ; none are left in a state of inactivity; but, on the other hand, if one be ex- cited, they will all move, which undoubtedly is a sympathetic phenomenon, or proceeding from the cellular communications. Are the nerves, on entering the muscles, di- vested of their cellular sheaths ; do they become pulpous ? Dissection proves nothing of the kind.

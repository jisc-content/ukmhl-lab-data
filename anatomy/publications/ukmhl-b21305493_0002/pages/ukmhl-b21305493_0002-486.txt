444 MUSCULAR SYSTEM larly liable to this affection. I have seen many cases of it, at least as many as of retention, dur- ing the last year of Desault’s practice. The func- tions of the intestines, and of the stomach, decay much later. The heart resists the longest: this organ is the ultimum moriens, as it was the first in exercise. Its action determines the duration of organic life. Third Variety—Constitution. The individual constitution modifies organic contractility in a very remarkable manner. It is sufficiently known, that in some subjects the pul- sations are more frequent, the secretion of urine more rapid $ that with others everything in or- ganic life is stamped by a remarkably slow pro- gress : now all these varieties most evidently have their primitive source in the contractility of the heart, of the stomach, of the intestines, &c. which have, in what regards this, a considerable influ- ence over the different temperaments. In this respect two essential considerations should be noticed : 1st. The varied powers of organic muscles do not always coincide with those of the muscles of animal life. Thus some persons are remarkable for a want of expression in the contour of the body, and for a weakness in the muscles of the

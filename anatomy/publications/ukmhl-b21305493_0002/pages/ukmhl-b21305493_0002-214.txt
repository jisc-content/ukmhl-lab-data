CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 172 lages, than in any other. I cannot explain why in the larynx, the arytsenoid cartilages are the most liable to this affection ; but on dissection, I found it a constant fact; every affection of the larynx, attended with caries, that I have observed in dead bodies, have afforded instances of it. SECTION III. Accidental Development of the Cartilaginous System. V The cartilaginous system, as well as that of the bones, is frequently developed in organs with which it is naturally unconnected, but with this distinction, that this phenomenon, with regard to the former, is the effect of age, whilst in the latter, it can only proceed from a morbid cause. Nothing is more common than to find cartilagi- nous knobs in schirrous, cancerous tumours, &c.; in the midst of those frequent morbid productions in which our parts assume a greasy aspect; in ob- structions of the lungs or liver, &c. I cannot conceive why the proper membrane of the spleen has so great a tendency to be impregnated with gelatine ; it is, of all the organs, that in which accidental cartilages are the most fre- quently produced. Generally it is by irregular blades these cartilaginous productions are formed ; sometimes this production invades the whole membrane, which then presents a convex surface, *

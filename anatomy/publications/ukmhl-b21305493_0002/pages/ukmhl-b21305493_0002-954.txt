912 F.PIDEKMOIDAL SYSTEM. a curved line, and by being subsequently blended with it, appears to form its internal sheet. The dermis, on the contrary, continued over the con- vex part of the last phalynx, assumes there a re- markable consistence, a reddish aspect, a texture % of a pulpy nature, and very distinct from that observed in other parts : it contains more ves- sels ; no areolas are observed; no prolongations shoot from it to the surface of the nail with % which the epidermis forms a body. These threads, the remnants of the lacerated exhalents, and which have been mentioned before, are never met with in this surface: thus no perspiration transudes through the nails ; no oily substance forms on their surface; no watery drops collect over their horny surface. Hence the nails are evidently separated from every other organ except the epi- dermis with which it is continued in its concave surface, and especially in its posterior and lateral edges. When, therefore, this continuity has been destroyed in the sides or behind, the whole nail, though healthy in the middle, soon drops off. The length of the free part of the nail cannot be easily determined. I have never seen Hallow- ed to acquire its natural growth: I have merely observed, that if it be left to grow to some extent, it obviously acquires a greater thickness in the middle than in the posterior parts. The thickness, resist- ance and hardness of the nail, generally increase in

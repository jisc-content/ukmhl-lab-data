595 ST ROUS SYSTEM. How far its quantity in clivers dropsies, particu- larly in those of the abdomen, may be increased is sufficiently shown. Does not this quantityvary according to the state of the organs enveloped by the serous membranes? It has long been said that synovia was more abundantly exhaled during the motion of the articu- lations than during rest. I have nothing to pro- duce in this respect grounded upon experiment; but I can affirm, having repeatedly ascertained it in living animals, that the exhalation of the serous surface of the abdomen is not increased during digestion, or at least, that if this happen to be the case, absorption becomes more active, and thus, that the peritoneum is not damper than at any other time. I have opened the chest of a number of young guinea pigs, after I had made them run for some length of time round a room to accelerate respiration ; but I did not find that the pleura was moister than usual; yet it cannot be questioned, as we shall see, that the quantity of serous fluids varies astonishingly in the different acute diseases; and that the exhalant surfaces pour out more or less of this fluid according to the way in which they may be sympathetically affected. I In the first periods of inflammations, when the exhalents are filled with blood, accidentally admitted, serum flows no longer from their free surface. Then, as they are exquisitely q q 2

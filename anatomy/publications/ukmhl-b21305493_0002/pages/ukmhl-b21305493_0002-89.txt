47 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Osseous System. SECTION i. Physical Properties. The bones are possessed of physical properties in an eminent degree. Solidity and hardness are their peculiar attributes,—a twofold advantage derived from the calcareous phosphate with which they are impregnated. This substance gradually increases as we advance in age. Elas- ticity is another of these properties combined with the preceding, but in a reverse order ; as it resides in the gelatinous substance, and in the cartilaginous part of these organs, it is more strik- ing as we approach the period of infancy. In the aged subject, the bone is completely deprived both of its suppleness and elasticity; it is more frequently fractured. Elasticity is more striking in the long and thin bones than in those of greater volume. The fibula will bend, and re-assume its primitive state; the tibia will also bend, but with more difficulty. This does not proceed from the one being more elastic than the other, but from • . * its organization being better accommodated to the exercise of this property.

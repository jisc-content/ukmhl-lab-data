OF ORGANIC LIFE. 431 that enter into the composition of these muscles must infallibly be intended for some use ; but this use we are unacquainted with. Organic Properties. Organic sensibility is strongly characterized in the muscles we are now considering; it must exist before the sensible organic contractility can be developed; but as these two properties are never separated, as they succeed each other in their exercise, what will be afterwards stated re- specting the one may be applied to the other. Insensible organic contractility, or tone, exists in the muscular system to that degree requisite for nutrition, without any further particularity at- tending it. Sensible organic contractility is the predomi- nant property in this system, nearly all the func- tions of which rest upon this property in the same manner as all the functions of the preceding mus- cular system are derived, as it were, from animal contractility. We shall then enter into the most minute particulars in examining this essential pro- i perty, in respect to which physiology is so much a indebted to the illustrious Haller. It may be con- sidered ; 1st. In respect to the excitants ; 2dly. 1 In respect to the organs; and 3dly. To the action i of the former upon the latter.

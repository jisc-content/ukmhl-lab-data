MUSCULAR SYSTEM 322 force, this organ is strongly irritated, and the animal is instantly seized with violent agitations; lessen the impulse and it becomes quiet. I have mentioned this experiment before. If the brain be laid bare, and irritated with a mechanical or chemical agent, <&c. the muscular system of ani- mal life is immediately excited. In these expe- riments, however, it should be noticed that the convexity of the organ appears to have less con- nection with the motions than its basis. Limited to the cortical, and to the superficial layers of the medullary substance, the irritation is very trifling, it is only on reaching the inferior layers that convulsions ensue. I have repeatedly at- tempted to determine the exact point where the irritation begins to cause convulsions, but this has constantly been attended with much diffi- culty, and the results have varied in an astonish- ing degree. I am led to believe that general con- clusions only can be established, namely, that in experiments, the nearer we approach the tuber annulare, and, generally speaking, the cerebral basis, the stronger will be the convulsions ; they have no relation with the cojivex surface. Let it be remarked, it is in the part of their basis, that is to say, in their most essential part, the brain receives the innumerable vessels that convey to it both excitation and life, either by the motion they communicate, or by the nature of the red blood

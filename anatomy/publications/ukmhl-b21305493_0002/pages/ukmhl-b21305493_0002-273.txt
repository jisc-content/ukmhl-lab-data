SECTION II. ; I General Fibrous Sheaths. The general sheaths are met with in the wrist, and in the instep, where they are termed annular ligaments. They are intended to maintain several united tendons in their re- spective situations. As in these two parts all those of the hand or of the foot have to cross through rather a narrow space, it was indispen- sable they should be properly secured; besides, these sheaths serve also in some cases to change their directions, as may be seen by those that lesort to the thumb, either in its palmar or on its dorsal surface, and which evidently trace an angle on crossing under the sheath. The tendons of the little finger display a similar dispo- sition.

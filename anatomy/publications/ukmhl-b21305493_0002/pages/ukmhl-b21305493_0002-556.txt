514 MUSCOUS SYSTEM. That in the stomach this vascular net-work is continued with the exhalants, and pours out the gastric juices; that in the intestines it interweaves with the origin of the absorbants which encom- pass these villi, is what can no longer be doubted from the experiments and observations of anato- mists, who of late have given the lymphatic sys- tem a special consideration. But all this does not prevent the basis of these villi from being of a nervous nature, and from their fulfilling, in re- spect to the mucous membranes, the same func- tions as the papillae of the cutis. This manner of viewing them by explaining their existence in every mucous surface by a general observation, appears to me much more conformable with the course followed by nature, than to suppose them performing in each individual part, distinct, and frequently even quite opposite functions. The question, besides, will not be easily de- cided by ocular observation. The structure of these minute projections is concealed from the sight by their excessive tenuity, even when as- sisted by our microscopic instruments; agents from which anatomy and physiology do not seem to me to have reaped much advantage, because, whenever we look in the dark, each sees accordingly as he is prejudiced or affected. The observation then of the vital properties should guide us more particularly. Now, from such ob- servation, the villi are evidently of the nature I

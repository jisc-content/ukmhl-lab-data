The long muscles in general are placed in the limbs, to the conformation of which theirs is ac- commodated. Separated from the skin by apo- neuroses, from the bone by the periosteum, they are contained in a kind of fibrous funnel, as it were, which strictly maintains them in their re- spective situations, and in which they are disposed in layers more or less numerous: the deepest are fixed in their places by the uppermost, these are in turn confined by the aponeuroses. In these they are remarkably long; commonly they belong to the motions of three or four bones, and even to more; as the sartorius, the semi-ten- dinous and semi-membranous, the biceps, the flexors, and the extensors afford instances of.

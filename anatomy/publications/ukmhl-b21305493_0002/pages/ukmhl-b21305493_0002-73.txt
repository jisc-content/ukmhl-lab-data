31 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. separated from the living bone ; but these are nothing more than the produce of exfoliation itself; then, in fact, the surface of the bone dies ; the superficial vessels are no longer supplied with blood; the fluid is checked in the part deprived of life; there, also, the exhalation of the calca- reous phosphates finds its limits, every species of vascular exhalant or absorbant organ is destroyed ; a chronic inflammation, attended^ with suppura- tion, ensues, and draws the line, and as this line is frequently drawn on the very same level, all that lays above is converted into an inorganic layer that gradually exfoliates and retains the solidity of the bone, because the absorbents being impaired, could not rob it of the calcareous substance. Be- sides nothing is more common than to find ex- foliation is not affected in the lamellae, and the bone to display subsequently an uneven surface produced by the irregular thickness of the exfo- liated parts. Finally, exfoliation frequently takes place in quite a reverse sense to what these lamel- lae are supposed to assume: this is seen by the separation of the parts in the heads of the long bones that have remained exposed to the air, or been so much irritated by amputation, by the fall of horns, &c. Let us then consider the compact tissue as an assemblage of united fibres, but not arranged in distinct layers, that can only be con- ceived abstractedlv. â€¢/ In their organic arrangement, the fibres of the

Now in what con- sists the difference between the skin of young animals and that of old ones? It is that in the former the gelatine predominates over the fibre, whilst in the latter, the fibre is the most abundant. The skin of infants thickens by degrees, and it is only towards the thirteenth year that it ac- quires the thickness it will retain. Until then the difference in this respect accords with the age. If the skin be examined at birth, at two, six, ten, fifteen, and twenty years, &c., these differences will be found most striking. The thicker the skin becomes the more the density it acquires, owing to the predominance of the fibrous substance over the gelatine. In proportion as we advance in age, the ad- hesion of the internal surface of the dermis with the subjacent cellular tissue, becomes much stron- ger; more exertion is required to separate them. By degrees, wrinkles form upon the face : joy and grief operating in quick succession, are the most frequent causes of motion in the features of the infant, and are produced on every occasion by the slightest causes.

MUSCULAR SYSTEM 276 rows, as in the gluteus major, the deltoid, See.; at other times in more regular apposition, as in the greatest number of wide muscles, con- stantly united with several other fibres of a si- milar nature; a union that is very apparent to the naked eye, but inscrutable even with the assist- ance of the glass, from its excessive tenuity, when submitted to inspection in an insulated manner : notwithstanding this excessive tenuity, number- less researches have been tried in the last century to determine with certainty the volume of this fibre. I refer on this head to the works of Leuwenoek, Muysk, &c. I shall not mention here the result of their researches, because it can be of no use to science, and their correctness cannot be relied upon; besides, what have we to do with the precise dimension of the muscular fibre ? its investigation could add nothing to the physiological notions respecting the motions of these organs. Every muscular fibre over-runs its distance with- out separating or dividing in any manner what- ever, notwithstanding that many have asserted this to be the case; it is merely in juxtaposi- tion with the adjoining ones, and by no means interwoven, as is frequently the case in the fibrous system; a disposition necessitated by the isolated motions it is commissioned to per- form ; for the general contraction of a muscle, is the assemblage of innumerable partial con-

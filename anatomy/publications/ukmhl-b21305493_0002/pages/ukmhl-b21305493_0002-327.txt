OF ANIMAL LIFE. 285 that which incessantly exhaled and absorbed, con- tributes more than all the rest to its vital phe- nomena ; it constitutes the essence of the mus- cle, that is its principal characteristic, as the phosphate of lime is the characteristic nutritive substance of bones. Is this substance formed in the blood, and from thence conveyed to the mus- cle, or is it produced in the organ itself, by nu- trition, and from the muscle conveyed to the blood ? I cannot determine. Whatever may be the case, its exhalation and absorption seem to undergo innumerable varieties : the state of laxity, that of cohesion, the appearances of the muscular tissue varied ad infinitum, seem to be partly owing to these varieties of proportions : thus does the calcareous phosphate or gelatine, reduced by nutrition, impart to the bone softness or friability. In this fibrous and essential part of the muscle, particularly, resides the faculty of twisting by the action of caloric, either on immersing the muscle in boiling water, or on exposing it to fire ; for this shrinking is as evident in the muscle deprived of its colouring matter, of its gelatine, of its albu- mina, and even of a portion of its extractive sub- stance, as in the common muscle. There is in general a constant connection between the quan- tity of this fibrous substance contained in mus- cles, and that of the blood. In strong, hardy, and sanguine constitutions, as they are termed, the muscles are thicker and much more fibrous.

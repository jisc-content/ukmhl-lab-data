The articula- tions of the cartilages of the larynx are lubricated, like those of bones, by the synovial fluid; and here any transudation whatever of marrow is evidently impossible, since there is no marrow in the substance of gristles. 4thly. In diseases that affect the articulations, and alter the fluids with which they are moistened, the marrow gene- rally continues healthy, nor is it changed in the diseases affecting the interior cavities of bones, whose influence especially bears upon the medul- lary organ. 5thly. To conclude : the experiment I have made, and which has been related in the chapter on marrow, most evidently proves there is no such thing as a transudation of this fluid. In order to explain the manner in which sy- novia was separated from the blood, Desault added to that pretended transudation of marrow another transudation, flowing from every part within the articulation, as from the capsular and inarticular ligaments, the adipose matter, cartilage, &c. A single simile will be sufficient to appre-

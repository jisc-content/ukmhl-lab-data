MUSCULAR SYSTEM 302 outwards the pectoralis-major is extended ; when lifted it extends the latissimus dorsi and rhomboi- deus-major. Every considerable flexion obviously extends the antagonist muscles, and vice versa. Whenever a muscle is extended by its antagonist, that organ is left completely passive ; it is mo- mentarily deserted, as it were, by its contracti- lity, or rather still possessed of it, this property is less active ; it merely obeys the motion that is communicated to it. In these cases the disten- sion exclusively bears upon the fleshy part, the tendon has nothing to do with it: whatever may be the distance between the points of insertion, whether they are removed farther from each other, or drawn nearer together, during the diffe- rent degrees of extension, it remains the same; the longer the muscle the more easily it is ex- tended. The sartorius, the posterior muscles of the thigh, &c. obviously display this phenomenon : thus is their position perfectly accommodated to it. In general, all the muscles remarkable for their extent are superficial, and most commonly traverse one or two articulations; sometimes even three or four, as in the limbs. Now the number of these articulations readily admits of very considerable variations in the space included between the two points of insertion, variations to which the great extensibility of these muscles are adapted. From what has been above stated it will be easily conceived, that it is the length of the

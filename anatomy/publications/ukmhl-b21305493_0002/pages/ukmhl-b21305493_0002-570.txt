MUCOUS SYSTEM. 628 most probably, the saliva, the pancreatic juice and the tears are also expelled w ith the faeces, which, on account of their hue, cannot, like the bile, be distinguished. I do not know, even, if on reflect- ing on a multiplicity of phenomena, we should not be inclined to lay down as a general princi- ple, that every fluid separated by secretion, never re-enters the circulation, that this phenomenon only belongs to fluids separated by exhalation, those of the serous cavities, of the articulations, of the cellular tissue, of the medullary organ, &c.; that all fluids are thus either excrementitial or re- crementitial, and that some of them are recrimen- titial excrements, according to the vulgar division. Bile in the gall bladder, urine in the bladder, se- men in its receptacles, are undoubtedly absorbed ; but the fluid itself is not returned into the circu- lation ; its finest parts only, a few of its princi- ples we are not well acquainted with, probably the serous and lymphatic part; this is nothing si- milar to the absorption from the pleura and other analogous membranes, where the fluid is returned to the blood, such as it was when emitted. A more positive fact, in respect to the outward excretion of the secreted fluids, is, that I never could succeed in having bile absorbed by the lymphatics ; by injecting it in the cellular tissue of an animal, it caused inflammation, and sub- sequently suppuration. It is well known that

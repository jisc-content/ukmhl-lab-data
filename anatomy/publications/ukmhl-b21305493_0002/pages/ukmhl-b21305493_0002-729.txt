687 GLANDULAR SYSTEM. iii our manner, of viewing the moral phenomena, and those of physics ; hence the habit of always starting from the same principles, on reasoning upon them. This habit we have transferred to the study of the living economy, without reflect- ing that its phenomena constantly vary, that under circumstances perfectly similar they are rarely alike ; that they are incessantly either ex- alted or reduced, and admit of a thousand various modifications. Nature seems, at every instant, fantastical and capricious, inconsistent with her- self in their production, because the essence of the laws that preside over these phenomena is not the same as that which presides over those of physics. The experiments, the results of which I have just been describing, for the secreted fluids, form a contrast with those I published last year, in which these very same fluids were attended with fatal consequences the moment they were conveyed through the carotids to the brain. This is a general phenomenon attendant upon all irritating fluids; whether they are borrowed from the economy, or are foreign to it, they cause instant death the moment they reach the cerebral organ, without having undergone any alteration, and by immediate injection ; whilst they may be injected into the veins without producing any effect, as the experiments of physicians in the last ce jected without danger, as I have observed, in ntury have proved. They might even be in-

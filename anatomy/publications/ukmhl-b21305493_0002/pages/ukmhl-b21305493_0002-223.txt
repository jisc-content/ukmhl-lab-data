181 FIBROUS SYSTEM. own ; 4thly. All the aponeuroses, either for en - velopement or for insertion, disclose similar in- terweavings ; 5thly. The tendons, by their ex- tensions, are every where confounded with this membrane ; 6th. In the two ends of the filaments it unites its fibres with theirs ; the tunica albuginea, the perichondrium of the larynx, the membranes of the spleen and kidneys only, form exceptions to this general rule. The fibrous system then must be conceived in a general manner; that is to say, as every where extended ; belonging at the same time to a number of organic processes, distinct in each by its form, but continued with the greatest number, having communications every where. This maimer of viewing it will appear still more natural, when we consider that the periosteum, or general abut- â–  ment for the divers parts of this system, is itself everywhere continued, and that in those parts wherein it is separated by an articulation, the fibrous capsules and ligaments are, as has been stated, the means of union. From this use of the periosteum in respect to the fibrous system, the advantage derived from its situation over the bones, that affords it and the organs with which it communicates, a firm support, is easily conceived.

MEDULLARY SYSTEM. 136 ventosa, venereal diseases, &c. : as the membrane is not in its natural state, no consequences can be deduced to appreciate the mode of the vital powers with which it is naturally endowed. I have observed that its sensibility is so much the more striking, as the instrument introduced- in living animals approaches the centre of the bone. In the extremities of the medullary tube, this sen- sibility is rather obscure ; in the middle of the bone the section is very painful. From what can proceed this difference in the sensitive powers, in their gradual decrease from the centre to the ex- tremities ?â€”the medullary system, evidently, does not possess animal sensibility and sensible organic contractility. From this exposure of the vital powers that animate this system, it is evident that vitality is here much more active than in the svstem of the bones, that their vital phenomena are consequent- ly more rapid, and must deviate from the chronic course that characterizes every disease of the bone, and more readily admits of every sympathetic exci- tation from the other organs. I am convinced that many indefinable painful sensations, that are ge- nerally attributed to the diseases of the bones, arise from the medullary system, especially from that in the middle of the long bones : let us remark, in fact, that the greatest part of these pains are seat- ed in the middle of the limbs, and that they are actually felt in the direction of this system.

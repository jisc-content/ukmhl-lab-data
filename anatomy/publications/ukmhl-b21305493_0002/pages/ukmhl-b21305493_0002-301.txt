259 FIBRO-CA RTILAG1NOUS SYSTEM. SECTION II. Parts common to the Organization of the Fibro-Cartilaginous System. The organs in common of the fibro-cartilages are not very striking; they are but sparingly supplied with cellular tissue, which is so very dense in these parts it is hardly discernible, but is rendered very apparent by maceration. In the natural state their vascular system con- tains but little blood. I have ascertained this by dis- secting an animal purposely killed by strangula- tion, a state in which the blood accumulating in the capillaries interposed between the arteries and the veins, particularly towards the head, renders these vessels excessively apparent; but in inflammation, which seldom affects the fibro-cartilages, they are much injected. No nerves can be traced. ARTICLE III. Properties of the Fihro-Cartilaginous System. Physical Properties. Elasticity essentially belongs to this system. This property is evidently proved ; 1st. In the fibro-cartilages of the ears, whenever they are bent; 2dly. In those of the nose, whenever s 2

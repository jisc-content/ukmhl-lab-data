OF ANIMAL LIFE. 385 foss for instance, being less deep, increase the cerebral cavity, and reduces that filled up by the crotaphyte. This is a trifling anatomical fact, which is owing to an important law of nutrition, namely, the predominance in the developement of the nervous system, to which the brain belongs over the muscular system of animal life. Let us remark that this predominance, from which arises at that age an evident disproportion be- tween the two muscular and nervous systems compared to what they will become in progress of time, would alone be sufficient to prove, as has been stated, that muscles are not a termi- nation or an expansion of the nerves. In fact, two species of organs, whose developement is quite the reverse, could not possibly belong to the same system. Several authors have maintained that the fleshy mass is proportionally much more developed in the foetus than the tendon, that the latter even is wanting. I cannot conceive whence such an opinion could arise. That the aponeuroses of the extremities may in the early months have been thought deficient may be conceived. I have, in fact, constantly observed, that at that epoch they do not actually display that whitish appearance by which they are subsequently characterized, and which is assumed only when their fibres are de- veloping ; they are transparent like a serous mem- VOL.

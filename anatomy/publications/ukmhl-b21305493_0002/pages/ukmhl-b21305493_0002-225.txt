183 FIBROUS SYSTEM. strongly retain together their articulating surfaces. The aponeuroses retain the muscles together and prevent their displacement. The tendons inces- santly exposed to the contraction of these organs, are every instant placed between the energetic power they represent, and the more or less re- sistance offered by the extremity of the muscles, &c. Such is this resistance, that it frequently proves superior even to that of the very bone itself. We are aware, that by the muscular exertions, the patella, the olecranon, and the os calcis, are sometimes fractured. Now this would not be the case if the tissue of the exterior ten- dons that correspond with these different bones, exposed to contraction, were more easily lace- rated. To that resisting power the following pheno- mena must be referred; 1st. Luxations in the corpse are produced with the utmost difficulty, particularly in the articulations commonly called enarthrodial; 2dly. In the living subject, exter- nal mechanical efforts are seldom sufficient to produce them ; they require a powerful muscular action; 3dly. The punishment formerly in use, by which criminals were drawn in quarters by four horses, was so much the more cruel, that the resistance opposed by the ligaments prolonged the duration of the agony ; in almost every instance the powers of the horses pro ved ineffectual to tear the limbs asunder, and the knife was used to

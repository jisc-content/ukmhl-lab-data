ANALYSIS. XVII ARTICLE I. Forms of the Muscular System of Organic Life. Curved direction of the fibres.—They do not originate from the fibious system.—Varieties in the muscular forms, according to the respective organs. - - 402—404 ARTICLE II. Organization of the Muscula? System of Organic Life. Their general distinction in organization from the preceding 404—405 Sect. I.— Tissue proper.— General disposition of the muscular fibres.— Analogy with, and distinction from the preceding 405—408 V Sect. II.—Parts common.—Cellular tissue.—Blood vessels.—Nerves of the ganglia, and cerebral nerves.—Proportion of each class 408—410 ARTICLE III. Properties of the Muscular System of Organic Life. Sect. I.—Properties of Tissue.—Extensibility.—Character peculiar to this property in organic muscles.—It is not extensibility that comes into play in aneurisms’’of the heart, or in pregnancy.—Remarks in this respect - - 410—416 Contractility.—Is proportioned to extensibility.—Substances contained within hollow muscles act as their antagonists.—Remarks 416—418 Sect. II.— Vital Properties—Sensibility.—Weariness in organic muscles. —Remarks upon hunger - - 418—420 Contractility.—Null in these muscles.—Divers experiments.—Observa- tions.—Of muscles partly voluntary and partly organic.—Experi- ments.—Remarks on the bladder, rectum, &cc.—Nervous influence null in organic muscles - 420 - 431 Organic Properties.—General remarks - 131 Of Sensible Organic Contractility, considered in respect to the exciting Agents, fyc. - - 432 Natural Excitants.—Divers observations.-r-Remarks on the influence of fluids over solids.—Influence of the quality and quantity of fluids upon the hollow muscles - - 432 - 435 Artificial Excitants.—Effect of this agency.—Their divers modes of operating.—Shrinking and vital contraction limited 436—440 Of Sensible Organic Contractility considered in respect to the Organs 440 VOL.

FIBROUS SYSTEM. 200 acute pains experienced immediately before the accident by those that have ruptured a tendon, pains that are partly destroyed by the accident itself; 6thly. Those less violent, which we ex- perience when any tendon, the tendon achilles for instance, is, by a wrong* position, rather too much extended; 7thly. The considerable increase of pain experienced when, in a collection of mat- ter beneath an aponeurosis, this not admitting of extension, is forcibly elevated ; 8thly. The painful sensation experienced, when the leg is too much extended, and the two oblique liga- ments intended to limit this extension are too strongly drawn in the attempt, &c. &c. To the deficiency of sensibility in the fibrous organs in respect to one mode of excitation, and to their sensibility in respect to another, must be referred, the contradictory results produced by the experiments of Haller, and those of his antagonists on the other, with regard to the dura- mater. Characters of the Vital Properties. Vital activity begins to be more evident in the fibrous system than in those of the bones and car- tilages. This is very evidently proved ; 1st. By the mode of animal sensibility, we have just noticed, and which is wanting in the others ;

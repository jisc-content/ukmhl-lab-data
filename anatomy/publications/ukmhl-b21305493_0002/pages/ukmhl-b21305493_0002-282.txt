FIBROUS SYSTEM. 240 served in the bundles of muscles originating from each of the condyles of the humerus. These aponeuroses always receive the insertions of the fleshy fibres in a very oblique direction ; they are intimately attached to each otherâ€”a circumstance I shall notice when treating of the tendons. They afford the great advantage of multiply- ing prodigiously the points of insertion with- out the necessity of increasing the extent of the bony surfaces : the width of the whole temporal fossa would not be sufficient for the masseter if it arose by insulated fibres. By means of the aponeurotic partitions which receive its fibres, and then proceed on to be attached to the bone, its insertion is Concentrated over one of the ridges of the zygomatic arch. Thus every powerful muscle, whose fibres consequently are consider- ably multiplied, are generally traversed by a si- milar aponeurosis ; of which we find instances in the deltoid, the pterygoid muscles, &c. Nearly all of these aponeuroses are perfectly similar to tendons; several are continued with them, and then their fibres follow the same di- rection. Not to have their fibres interwoven in a thousand different directions, like those of the aponeuroses intended for coverings, is in general a distinctive character of this species of aponeu- roses ; the reason of it is very simple : the fleshy fibres they give insertion to being nearly all dis-

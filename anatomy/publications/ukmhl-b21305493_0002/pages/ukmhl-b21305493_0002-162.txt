OSSEOUS SYSTEM. no man, numerous causes, arising particularly from the nature of the food, from its degree of heat or cold, from the mode of dressing it, and from its innumerable varieties, accelerate the time of the natural death and fall of the teeth, because by incessantly exciting these organs, they keep them in an habitual state of activity that exhausts their life, which would not otherwise terminate so soon. Thus also will a thousand causes, arising from the state of so- ciety, put an end to general life at a period long before that intended and ascribed by nature it- self; but in general, in animals, the death of the tooth always precedes that of every other organ, and yet these do not live under social influence, and they always masticate food intended by na- ture to be in contact with their teeth. In old age, the jaws robbed of their teeth, con- tract, the sockets are obliterated, the tissue of the gums hardens, and mastication is continued, though more imperfectly. In that change of con- formation, the ridge of the alveoli drops back- wards ; hence the projection of the chin. It de- creases in height; from whence its approximation to the nose, a phenomenon which also especially proceeds from the loss of the teeth.

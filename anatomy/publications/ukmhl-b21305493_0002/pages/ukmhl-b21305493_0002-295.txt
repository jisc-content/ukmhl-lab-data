253 FIBRO-CA11TILAGINOUS SYSTEM. forms. These substances may be designated by the words fibro-cartilaginous membranes ; besides, it is not only in the form, but also in the nature, that the parts of this class differ, as we shall per- ceive, from those of the other classes. In the second class are ranked the inter-articu- lar substances, interposed in the interstices of the moveable articulations, whether being partly free in the cavity, such as those of the knee, of the inferior jaw, &c. they move, according to the motions performed by the organ, in different di- rections, or, like those of the body of the ver- tebrae, they are fixed in a solid manner, although moveable over the surfaces of the bones. These organs in general are thicker than the preceding, remarkably variable, presenting commonly la- mellae, sometimes perforated through their cen- tre in the articulating cavities, disposed in very thick bundles, and figured like the body of the vertebrae in the spine. They may be designated by the name of articulating fibro-cartilages. I have allotted to the third class particular por- tions of the periosteum, in which this membrane completely changes its nature, impregnates itself with gelatine, and displays at first an aspect ana- logous to that of the cartilages, but in which, however, the fibrous tissue is easily distinguished. These portions are met with in the tendinous sheaths, in which they facilitate the motion of the tendons, and protect the bones against their

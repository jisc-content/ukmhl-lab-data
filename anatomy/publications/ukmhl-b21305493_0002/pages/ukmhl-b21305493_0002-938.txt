EPIDERMOIDAL SYSTEM. 896 that in organs naturally gifted with it. What is the reason of this ? From its being indispensably requisite that the rudiments of animal sensibility should previously exist in an organ, for its de- velopment, and that this organ also should be possessed of organic sensibility, which on being increased by stimulants, is changed into animal sensibility: now the epidermis appears to be also deprived of this last property, as well as of in- sensible contractility. In fact, 1st, it has no ap- parent circulation; 2ndly, the exhalents and absorbents by which it is crossed have no connec- t on with this membrane; ordly, no morbid phenomenon, which naturally supposes organic sensibility, has ever been detected in the epider- mis. It never inflames ; in every cutaneous affec- tion it is entirely passive, and in spite of continuity never partakes of the infection. The impossi- bility of its inflaming renders it wherever it exists an obstacle to cutaneous adhesions that can never be effected but after it has been removed : nor will its internal surface, raised by blistering, and again applied over the dermis after the eva- cuation of the fluid through a puncture, ever unite. 4thly. The excrescences that have their seat in this membrane, as corns, particular indu- rations, &c. are, as well as the very membrane itself, inert, dry, and void of internal circulation ; if they are attended with pain, it is owing to tlie pressure the subjacent nerves are exposed to ; the

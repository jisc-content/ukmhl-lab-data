92 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. divide into two compact tables, the interspace of which is filled with cancelli; gradually the edges come in contact, and then sutures are formed in the skull; for there is this distinction between their ossification and that in the long bones, that it constantly goes diverging from the centre to the circumference, and new rudiments are not formed in this circumference to meet the others. When this takes place, then the re-union is not forwarded as in the long bones, but sutures form, and it is this process that constitutes the wormian bones, that are larger in proportion, as the nucleus has been sooner formed, because it has had sufficient time to extend before meet-â€™ ing with the general ossification of the bone. When a flat bone is developed in different parts, and it contains an articulating surface, this is generally the centre, in which all the points meet, when ossification is nearly completed ; the cotyloid cavity, the condyle of the occipital, &c. are instances of this. There are frequently two very distinct epochs in the ossifications of flat bones, that, like the sacrum or the sternum, form in numerous parts. These rudiments first unite into three or four essential pieces that divide the bone; this is the first period; subsequently, the union of these parts takes place ; this constitutes the second period of ossification.

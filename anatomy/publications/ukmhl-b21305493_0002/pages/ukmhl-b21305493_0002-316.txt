MUSCULAR SYSTEM 274< power on the one hand, and a limited extent of motion on the other, are required: thus around the temporo-maxillary articulation there are the % masseter and the pterygoid muscles, around ; the ischio-femoral, the quadratics, the gemelli, even the obturators, &c.; around the scapula-humoral articulation, the infra spinalis and rhomboideus minor ; in the hand, the muscles of the thenar and hypothenar eminences ; in the foot, various fleshy skains ; in the spine, the interspinales ; on the head, the little and great anterior, posterior, and lateral recti, will all display with more or less regularity the forms we are examining, and answer the two- fold purpose I have alluded to ; on the one part by the very great number, on the other by the short- ness of their fibres. The short muscles are more frequently than the wide united together, either in their origin, or in their termination, as is seen in the foot, in the hand, &c. Sometimes they assume a triangu- lar form, as is observed in these two parts ; at other times they approach the cubical figure, of which the pterygoid muscles and the masseters are instances: they are seldom covered with aponeuroses, undoubtedly because, by the short- ness of their fibres they are not otherwise ex- posed to considerable displacements; besides the division of the muscles into long, wide, and short, is similar to that of the bones, liable to a multiplicity of modifications. Several of these

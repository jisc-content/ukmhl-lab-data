MUSCULAR SYSTEM 360 that is well nourished, and is strongly depicted through the integuments, because its fibres are very thick, will contract more powerfully than the thin emaciated muscle, whose fibres, loose and pale, are hardly seen to project. In estimating the degree of muscular power, we always refer to the appearance of the muscle; the statues that represent power and strength. constantly display an energetic developement of muscular forms. When the brain operates with energy upon such muscles, the extraordinary motions they are capable of performing are beyond con- ception. Haller and others have quoted a mul- tiplicity of instances of their astonishing powers ; either of those of the back, to bear burthens, or the superior extremities to lift up weights, or of the inferiors to perform extraordinary leaps, or maintain attitudes by which it is supposed that enormous resistance is surmounted. It is the cerebral influence in particular that increases the power of muscular contraction. The will may exalt that power to a high degree; but other causes that are independent of the will, render that power infinitely greater. The addi- tional strength acquired by passion, by a state of insanity, that observed in subjects labouring un- der delirium in consequence of violent fever, &c. are sufficiently obvious. In all such cases, the impulse conveyed by the brain will sometimes be such, that the smallest muscle of the weakest

OF ANIMAL LIFE. 275 organs, in fact, assume a compound character; thus the sub-scapularis, the infra spinalis, are in- termediate to the wide and short forms; thus cannot the crural, the gastrocnemii, be referred either to the wide or to the short muscles. Na- ture varies according to the functions the organs are intended to perform; the conformation of their impulsive agents and its progress admit of no- thing more than approximations in our anatomi- cal divisions. ARTICLE II. Organization of the Muscular System of Animal Life. That part peculiar to the muscle, is what is commonly called the muscular fibre ; the parts in common are composed of the vessels, the nerves, the exhalents and absorbents, and the cellular tissue met with in abundance round these fibres. SECTION i. Tissue peculiar to the Organization of the Muscular System of Animal Life. The muscular fibre is red, soft, uniform in thickness in the large and small muscles, some- times disposed in very apparent bundles, sepa- rated from each other by very remarkable fur- t 2

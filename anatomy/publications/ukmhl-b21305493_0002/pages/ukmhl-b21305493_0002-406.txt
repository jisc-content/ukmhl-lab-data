364 MUSCULAR SYSTEM numerous calculations. None of them could ever be correct, because the vital powers vary ad infinitum, and are never the same in two indivi- duals, because cerebral influence, and the power of muscular organization, are never found in an uniform proportion in the same subject. It is in the very nature of the vital phenomena to baffle all calculations, as it is in that of the powers they emanate from to display a character of irregula- rity which renders them perfectly distinct from the phenomena of physics. Let us merely con- clude from the preceding observations, that mus- cular exertions carried to the utmost by cerebral excitement, may produce astonishing effects, which effects admit of a power of contraction hardly to be conceived ; such are the ruptures of strong tendons, that of the patella, of the olecra- non, &c.; such is again the powerful resistance frequently opposed by the muscles to the enor- mous distentions required in cases of luxation, in those of fracture, &c. SECTION II. Rapidity of Contractions. Contractions ought to be considered both in respect to their rapidity and their powers. 1st. If they are produced by stimulants, by laying a muscle bare and by acting directly upon

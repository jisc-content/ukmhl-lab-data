423 OF ORGANIC LlFIi. say, if, in the affections of these muscles, we ex- amine the state of the brain, we shall find the same independence: let us consider the greatest number of vomitings, the irregular motions of the intestines that take place in diarrhoea, parti- cularly those which constitute volvulus, &c. or consider the heart during the divers agitations of fevers, during the irregular palpitations with which it is so frequently affected, &c. : in all these affections of the organic muscles we scarcely ever find any signs of cerebral affection; it re- mains calm, whilst in organic life all is in confu- sion. Cullen imagined, that in syncopy the ac- tion of the brain was first suspended, and subse- quently as a consequence, that of the heart: in most cases, however, it is precisely the reverse ; the heart being first affected ceases to act. Now its action being indispensable for that of the brain, either by the motion it communicates to it, / or by the red blood it propels, the functions of the latter are suddenly arrested, and animal life is at an end. This is particularly remarkable in syncopies arising from passions, in those proceeding from hemorrhage, from polypi, from copious eva- cuations, &c. For further particulars in this re- spect I shall refer to my book upon life and death. If from the influence of the brain we pass to that of the nerves, we find additional proofs of the deficiency of animal contractility in the or-

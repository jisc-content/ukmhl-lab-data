MEDULLARY SYSTEM. 138 medullary membrane remaining bare; the blood begins to circulate in the vessels, hitherto acces- sible only to white fluids, because its mode of organic sensibility is changed ; instead of admit- ting gelatine into its cellulee, it is marrow, and an- other fluid that fills them, a phenomenon that equally depends upon the change of organic sen- sibility. From this proceeds quite a new exterior, an organ new in appearance, whilst in reality it is not the organ that is changed, but the fluid it se- parates. A phenomenon nearly similar to this, is observed in the formation of callus, in which the portion of the medullary membrane correspond- ing to the fracture, is at first cartilaginous, subse- quently bony, and finally is restored to its primi- tive state. The marrow, however, does not begin to be ex- haled from the moment the blood circulates in the medullary tube, or rather when it commences, but I have found it quite different from what it will subsequently be in the adult. There is scarcely any proportion of oily substance, as we have seen in the medullary juice : 1st, it presents a mucilaginous and reddish aspect; pressed between the fingers, it leaves no oily impression, as in the adult, but a fluid like gelatine : 2dly, by comparing together the water, in which the marrow of both ages has separately undergone ebullition, innumerable small oily drops are not seen floating upon the former,

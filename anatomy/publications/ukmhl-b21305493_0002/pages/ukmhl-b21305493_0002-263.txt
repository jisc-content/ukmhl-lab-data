221 FIBROUS SYSTEM. that had acquired a very remarkable thickness. The periosteum of that bone was very thick, and so little adherent to that organ, that the slightest attempt sufficed to remove it in . its whole extent, and the fibres were so very thick, that upon being removed, it might have been mistaken for a portion of the palmar or plantar aponeurosis. The periosteum borrows its vessels from the ad- jacent ones. Their innumerable branches ramify in it ad infinitum, and form an intricate net, which is rendered very striking by injections, especially in infants: they are then lost in the compact tis- sue, or are returned to the adjacent parts, where they form divers anastomoses. This membrane, as we have said, gives inser tion to nearly the whole fibrous system; to the tendons, the ligaments, and especially to the apo- neuroses. It does not appear to be attached in ' the bones of infants, for by removing, at that age, the periosteum, the whole comes off together ; but ossification soon invades the most internal lamellae, and in the adult every fibrous organ seems indentified with the bone. I have observed that this disposition perfectly coincides with the pro- digious power of contraction which the muscles that have become more fully developed will form at that stage of life, and which power singly bearing upon the periosteum, which would have been the case had not ossification taken place,

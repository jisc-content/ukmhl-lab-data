FIBKOUS SYSTEM. 215 The fibrous peel is accessary only to its functions ; it is nothing more than an envelope. In erection, it merely obeys the impulse received. Whenever the corpus cavernosum is exposed to the action of nitric acid, the spongy tissue cleared of the blood it contained, assumes a much deeper yellow than the fibrous membrane. This serves to distinguish them from each other. By submitting the testis to the action of boiling water, its interior tissue is also seen to assume quite a different aspect from that of its exterior membrane; this is of a dark brown hue, whilst the other remains whitish; nor does it so readily admit of a gelatinous appearance, nor in so strik- ing a manner as that of the corpus cavernosum. When submitted to maceration, the testis is also quite different in its envelope, and in its interior tissue. The surface of the fibrous membranes, opposed to that corresponding with their organ, is united to the adjacent parts, sometimes in a loose man- ner, as in the cavernous envelope, at other times by very strong ties, as in the dura-mater. In general, the membranes, and even all the fibrous organs, have an astonishing tendency to unite intimately with the serous and mucous sur- faces. Instances are produced in respect to the serous membranes, by the union of the dura-ma- ter with the tunica arachnoides, of the tunica al- buginea with the tunica vaginalis, of the fibrous

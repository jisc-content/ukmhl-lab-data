DERMOIDAi, SYSTEM. 78,1 may, it undergoes the process of putrefaction in the very same manner as the subject completely deprived of life. Its progress even is then much more rapid, owing, on the one hand, to the natu- ral heat of the body, and on the other to the moisture of the surrounding parts rendering it much more rapid. This putrescency varies ac- cording to the state of the part at the time of death. If overrun with a considerable quantity of blood, as when the vital spark is extinguished by inflammation, putrescency assumes a very rapid course, the part suddenly blackens, and a most offensive sanious matter is discharged ; it is then termed humid. If a small quantity of blood only be contained in the part at the moment of death, the progress of putrescency is retarded ; at first it putrefies, subsequently blackens, and a small quantity of the sanious matter only flows from the part. This is the dry gangrene. Thus if any part of a corpse be somewhat gorged with blood, as the head in apoplectic subjects, its pu- trefaction is much more rapid and humid than that of other parts which contained less blood. In the gangrene proceeding from cold, a dry- ness of the part is frequently observed, because it hardly contained any blood at the moment of death. How ignorant many physicians prove themselves to be of the proceedings of nature, by the use they make of their antiseptics, which they indiscriminately apply both to the living body?

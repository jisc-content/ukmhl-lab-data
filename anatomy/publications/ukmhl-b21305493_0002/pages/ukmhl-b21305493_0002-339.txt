OF ANIMAL LIFE. 297 tion ; this is also the case in contusions, in which similar infiltrations are observed. In the muscles the veins constantly attend the arteries; distributed in the same manner, they borrow from the contractions of these organs an assistance essential to their action. The stream of blood is much greater when the patient, on bleeding, contracts his muscles, than when they ^remain relaxed. This motion is expressed in the same manner as water is forced from a sponge that has been wetted. This phenomenon is never observed in the arterial circulation. I have ob- served, that if we open the artery in the foot of an animal, and by irritating the nerves, cause the muscles of the leg and thigh, across which that artery passes to reach the bleeding part, and contract strongly, the stream of blood will remain the same as during a state of re- laxation. I have several times injected, with facility, the veins of the muscles of animal life, from the trunks towards the branches. This, notwithstand- ing what Haller has said, leads me to suppose, that in these organs as in the heart, the valves are not so numerous as in several others. The assistance which the veins borrow from the adja- cent organs, no doubt, forms a substitute to these folds, or rather renders them useless ; the weight of the column of blood producing no powerful effect on the parieties of the veins. We are well

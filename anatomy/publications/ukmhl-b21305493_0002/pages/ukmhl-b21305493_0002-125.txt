In the clevelopement of bones, three states are generally observed, namely, the mucous state, the cartilaginous, and that of solid bone. Mucous State. The mucous state may be conceived at two distinct epochs; 1st. In the early days of the developement of the embryo, when the sum of the organs is nothing more than a mucous homo- geneous mass, in which no outlines can be traced, and there is only parenchyma of nutrition. At that epoch all the organs are of the same nature: the bone, in fact, is like every other organ, a mu- cous substance, if by this word be understood a state in which the cellular tissue existing alone with the vessels and nerves is permeated with such a quantity of juices that it bears the appearance of pulp, and gives that appearance to the embryo. 2d.

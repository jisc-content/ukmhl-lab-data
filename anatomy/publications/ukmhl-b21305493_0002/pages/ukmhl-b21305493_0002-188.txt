CARTILAGINOUS SYSTEM. 146 exposed, and thus removes the danger that attends them. / The general character of interior conformation peculiar to these cartilages, is to be constantly less thick than wide, but of a thickness proportionate with the width ; so that the cartilages of large ar- ticulations exceed two, three, and even four times in this respect, those of the less extensive articula- tions ; to mould themselves on the articulating forms, to present two surfaces, and one circumfer- ence. One of these surfaces adheres to the bone in so intimate a manner, that it may be fractured in any other part rather than in this. The uniting medium is not exactly known: it appears cer- tain, however, that the cartilage is not an exten- sion, a continuation of the cartilaginous paren- chyma of the bone, for the fibres of this parenchy- ma are not continued with those of the cartilages ; if this were actually the case, by depriving along and fresh bone, provided with its cartilage, of the calcareous phosphate it is impregnated with, this continuity would necessarily be observed ; the bone and the cartilage would no longer differ from each other. Now, I have constantly observed in this experiment, that acids separate the car- tilages from the surface of the bone, either wholly or by fragments. The cartilaginous fibres of the bone divested of their saline substance, are evidently seen to terminate in the convex surface

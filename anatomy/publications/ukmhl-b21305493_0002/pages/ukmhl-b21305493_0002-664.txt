SEKOUS SYSTEM. 622 and perfectly transparent, they become gradually thicker with age, and assume a tarnished white appearance: their suppleness decreases gradually as their increase of density, and resist the different re-agents the less, as the subject is younger. In infants, they are much sooner reduced to an homogeneous pulp. I have observed that in the foetus undergoing putrescency, different gases frequently collect in the serous cavities, as may be ascertained by opening these cavities under water; a pheno- menon much less striking in the adult, in which subject the cellular tissue is frequently emphyse- matous from putrescency, without any thing escaping through the canula introduced into the peritoneal cavity, or in that of the pleura, as I have frequently ascertained myself. Gases much more frequently arise from the organs of the foetus, in experiments on maceration, than from those of an adult. SECTION II. State of the Serous System in the Subsequent Ages. In the adult the serous system is long station- nary as it were, before undergoing any evident change; its membranes merely follow the same laws that govern the organs by which they are

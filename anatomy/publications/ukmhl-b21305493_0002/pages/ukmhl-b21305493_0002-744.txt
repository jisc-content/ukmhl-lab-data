GLANDULAR SYSTEM. 702 glion, in the salivary glands proceeding from the superior cervical ganglion, in the testes from the lombar ganglia, &c. Notwithstanding what Bordeu has set forth, the nerves are in a very small proportion when com- pared with the volume of the gland. We should not, in fact, judge of this proportion by those of the parotid and of the submaxillary glans, which merely cross these glands without penetrating them, and supply them, as they proceed, with a few ramusculee only. For instance, amongst the organs which receive nerves, there are certainly none in the economy which, in proportion to size, receive less than the liver. The nerves also penetrate the glands nearly in the same manner as the blood vessels ; that is to say; 1st. On all sides for those unprovided with a membrane; 2dly. Through a fissure only for those invested by one. On reaching the organ they divide and subdivide, and are soon lost to the sight. A gan- glion is never found in the interior of a gland. Do the nerves influence the secretions ? This is highly probable, since every gland is provided with nerves, but they never impart by any means, such immediate influence as authors have pre- tended; 1st. It is said that the nerves of the pa- rotid gland were divided, and that the secretion of saliva was in consequence suppressed. Such division is obviously impossible, since the gland must be extirpated to remove the nerves; 2dly.

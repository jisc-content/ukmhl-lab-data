MUCOUS SYSTEM. 498 relaxation has but little influence upon its mucous membrane. Besides, in saying the mucous membranes (ad- mitting only of very few distinctions), constantly display the same surface in the extension as when contractedâ€”I merely mean in the ordinary state of these functions, and not in those enormous dila- tations often produced in the stomach, the blad- der, and in the intestines, though not quite so fre- quently in the latter. There is actually real ex- tension and contraction, which in the membrane coincide with those of the organ. A remarkable observation we are led to form in respect to the free surface of the mucous mem- branes, and to which I have already alluded, is, that this surface is every where in contact with bodies heterogeneous to that of the animal, whe- ther these bodies admitted from without, for nu- trition, are not yet assimilated to this substance, is seen in the alimentary canal and in the t trachea, or that they proceed from within, as is observed in the excretory tubes of the glands, all of which open into cavities lined with mucous membranes, and transmit the particles, which af- ter having contributed for some time to the com- position of solids, become heterogeneous, and are separated from them by that habitual motion of composition and decomposition incessantly conti- nued in living bodies. From this observation, the mucous membranes should be considered as limits,

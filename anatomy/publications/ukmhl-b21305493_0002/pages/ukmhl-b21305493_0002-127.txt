85 OSS LOUS SYSTEM. state begins at an epoch that can hardly be ascer- tained : on the one part it is, when the circulating system begins to convey gelatine, and to provide the organs with that substance ; on the other part, when the organic sensibility of the paren- chyma of nutrition for these organs, has become connected with that substance : then the consist- ence in bones progressively increases, because the gelatine is gradually accumulated. Now this ac- cumulates in the same manner as the calcareous phosphate at a later period; that is to say, it is in the middle of the long bones, in the centre of the flat, and also in the middle of the short bones, that this substance is at first exhaled, and from thence is successively extended to the ends of the first, to the circumference of the second, and to the surface of the third. I myst observe, however, that during the formation of cartilagi- nous bones, these longitudinal striee in long bones, radiated or divergent in the flat ones, and irre- gularly interwoven in the short bones ; that cha- racterize the bony state in its formation, and that seem to point out the course of the calcareous substance, are not observed. The cartilaginous state displays a peculiarity that distinguishes it from that of bone ; namely, that all the bones that will subsequently be united by means of cartilage, as those of the skull, of the face, of the spine, of the pelvis, form but one and the same pieces, whilst all those which are to

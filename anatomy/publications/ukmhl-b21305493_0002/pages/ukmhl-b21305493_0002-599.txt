Inasmuch as the or- ganic sensibility and insensible contractility are habitually increased, in consequence of the nu- merous functions over which they preside; 2dly. inasmuch as they incessantly vary, on account of the variety of exciting causes. In fact, let it be remarked, that in the systems of bones, fibres, cartilages, muscles, nerves, &c. on the one hand these properties are only brought into action by nutrition, and on the other hand, no exciting agent being in contact with these systems, they always continue the same. Hence it is not astonishing, if diseases in which organic sensibility and insensible contractility are concerned, so frequently affect the mucous organs. Every catarrhal affection, either acute or chronic, all kinds of hemorrhages, the number and di- vers tumours, polypi, funguses, &c. all kinds of excoriations, ulcers, &c. of which they are the seat, proceed from the .various alterations of their organic properties.

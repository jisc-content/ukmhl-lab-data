Every mucous membrane presents two sur- faces, the one adhering to the adjacent organs, the other free, covered with villi, and constantly moistened with a mucous fluid. Each of these claim a particular notice. The adherent surface almost every where corre- sponds to the muscles of animal or of organic life. The mouth, the larynx, the whole of the alimen- tary canal, the bladder, the vagina, the womb, a part of the urethra, &c. present muscular layers, which inclose their mucous membrane. This perfectly coincides, in animals possessed of a fleshy panniculus, with that of the skin, which also approaches in some degree the structure of the mucous membranes, and which, as we have already seen, is every where continued with them. It maintains them in constant motion, by which their secretion, the excretion that succeeds to it, and the various other functions which these or- gans are intended to perform. The insertion of this muscular layer, exterior to the mucous sys- tem, is effected by that dense and tight tissue I have named submucous. It is from this compact

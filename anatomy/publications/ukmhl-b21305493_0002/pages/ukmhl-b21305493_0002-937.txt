This tissue does not possess the least power of contraction; after applying a blister, it remains loose, and never contracts. The epidermis is completely destitute of any kind of animal sensibility whatever, it may be punc- tured, divided, and torn asunder with impunity. The soles of the feet, and palms of the hands, afford ample means for such experiments. The thickness of this membrane is such in these parts, that layers may be removed, as is seen by trying the edge of a knife ; that it admits, as we may see in our kitchens, of being in contact with burning coals ; that it is not impossible to tread upon a red hot iron, &c. It is owing to this insensibility, that this membrane opposes the action of acids, the caustic, alkalies, and of all powerful stimulants, which are so excessively painful when brought in contact with the dermis, exposed by a blister. The epidermis differs from the other organs, which as well as this are deprived of animal sen- sibility, as the cartilages, tendons, aponeuroses, &c. inasmuch as it can never acquire this pro- perty ; whilst the latter will sometimes attain, by being strongly excited, a degree superior to

The arms, the legs, the chest, the abdomen, are uniformly contractile in the different divisions that belong to them. This uniformity, on the contrary, is very seldom seen in the voluntary muscles: most gene- rally one will predominate over the others : some- times it is the heart, at other times the stomach, and sometimes the bladder. Frequently even all the gastric powers are not in the same proportion; the stomach will be languid whilst the intestines retain their natural action ; or although the sto- mach is in perfect order, the intestines being too contractile, instantly reject the faeees, and pro- duce diarrhoea. This essential distinction between the two muscular systems, proceeds from the contractility of the one depending upon a com- mon centre, the brain ; whilst that of the other, on the contrary, has its isolated principle in every part where it exists. Fourth Variety.â€”Sex. Women in general have more resemblance to children in their phenomena of sensible organic contractility. The weakness of their motions coincides with their greater rapidity in this sex, with whom all the interior muscles, like the ex- i terior ones, are thinner and weaker than in man. One might suppose that in them the powers of

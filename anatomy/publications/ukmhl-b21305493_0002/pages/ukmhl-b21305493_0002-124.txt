82 OSSEOUS SYSTEM. able articulations characterized by contiguous sur- faces, consists in a substance, the nature of which seems to form the medium between that of the ligaments and that of cartilages. ARTICLE V. Developement of the Osseous System. There is not a single system in the economy that has been more diligently followed up by ana- tomists in its different states, and at the different stages of life than this. The remarkable differ- ence between a bone, considered in the early months, when it is almost exclusively composed of gelatine, with a similar organ viewed in the adult, in which the calcareous substance predomi- nates, has especially directed their attention to this point. Let us examine the phenomena of os- sification in every age; these phenomena may be considered before growth, or subsequent to it. In general, as long as it lasts, there are constantly some parts in the osseous system that are not ossified, such as the neck of the femur, for in- stance. Ossification is not properly completed, nor the bones perfectly formed, until towards the sixteenth or eighteenth year, even sometimes later.

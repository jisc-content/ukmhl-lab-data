OF ANIMAL LIFE. 335 different preparations with water; the instant the muscles feel its approach there is an end to their motions, they become paralyzed as it were. I have generally observed, that it is far prefer- able in making experiments respecting the con- tact of p'as, or of various other fluids, with mus- o 7 cles, to inflate or inject the intermuscular tissue of a living animal, than to tear the organ off and immerse it full of life in these fluids, as seve- ral authors have done, or than to lay bare a mus- cle, and direct upon it a current of gas, or to moisten it with a fluid, to observe the effects of contact. From all that has hitherto been stated, it fol- lows ; 1st. That to answer cerebral excitation by contracting, the muscles should in general be in a state determined by the laws of its organization, that once out of that state it will no longer ad- mit of contraction, or at least it will effect but weak and irregular contractions only ; 2dly. That the contract of the different heterogeneous sub- stances produces upon the muscles very varia- ble effects. Several other causes besides those above related, seem to influence the various con- tractions on acting directly upon the muscles ; such is" the use of mercurial friction for the vene- real disease ; the influence of that metal, copper and lead, upon those who labour in their prepa- ration, the action of cold, the effect of certain fevers, &c. The quivering of muscles arising from

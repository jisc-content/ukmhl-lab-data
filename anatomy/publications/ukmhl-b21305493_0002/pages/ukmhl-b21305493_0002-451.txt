In the natural state they impart to the gastric viscera a pinkish hue, which may be made livid or restored to its primitive state, by turning the cock I adapt to the trachea in my ex- periments on asphyxia. The absorbents and exhalents have nothing particular in these muscles. They receive their nerves from two sources; 1st. From the cerebral system ; 2dly. From that of the ganglions. The nerves projected by the ganglions predo- minate every where, except in the stomach, to which organ the par-vagum is extended. They are the most essential ones in the heart; in the intestines they are exclusive; at the extremity of the rectum, and of the bladder, they are more numerous than those proceeding from the spine. The cerebral nerves intermix with these on plunging into the organic muscles. The cardiac, solar, and epigastric plexuses, result from this in- terlacement, which apparently influences the mo- tions, although we are unacquainted with the na- ture of this influence. Every nerve proceeding from ganglious, and that plunges into the organic muscles, does not seem exclusively intended for them ; a consider- able number of filaments belong to the arteries ; such is, in fact, the interlacement they form,

How can we form a correct idea of life, except by com- paring organic bodies with those of an inert kind ! Inorganic bodies are governed by physical laws, and possess the properties of gravity, affinity, elasticity, &c.; in fact, they are only endowed with the common qualities of matter. Organic bodies, though not exempt from the influence of physical laws, obey particular laws of their own, and are distinguished from inert matter by their vital properties referable to sensibility and contractility. How simple soever organized bodies may be formed, they are necessarily composed of a multiplicity of elementsâ€”an union of solids and fluids, which from their combination re- sult nutrition and developement.

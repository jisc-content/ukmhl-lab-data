INTRODUCTORY LECTURE. 25 whether credence is to be given to the state- ment or not, I cannot tell. The principal varieties of the solids, are the, bones with their appendages, the ligaments and the cartilages, the muscles with their tendons, the vessels, and the membranes, whose textures are as dissimilar as their uses. Physiologists of this and other countries, have made various arrangements of the solids, some reducing the primitive tissues to three, others to more or less. Bostock divides the solids into the osseous matter, the membranous, the muscular, the adipose, and the cellular. The solids necessarily perform manifold functions, as they widely differ in structure; but all, however, are areolar, and more or less permeable. The colour of the organs de- pends upon the fluids contained in them. Their structure departs from softness to extreme density. Cohesion, flexibility, ex- tensibility, and elasticity, appear to be the properties of membrane, but elasticity is its D

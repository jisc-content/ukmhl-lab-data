INTRODUCTORY LECTURE. 15 Â« may be inclined to think that I have drawn a line of demarcation between them, that ought to be respected, but be assured that the labours of the Anatomist are so intimately as- sociated with the researches of the Physiolo- gist, that such a distinction ought to be ef- faced. Anatomy and Physiology are so closely connected, that to me, they appear in- separable. The immortal Haller first taught a rational method of enquiry, viz. that a knowledge of the functions being the object of our study, and that of the organs to accom- plish that object: both form a whole which cannot be separated without rendering in- complete the division. Physiology is the science of life, whose object is the investiga- tion of the functions performed by our organs, which at once points out the incapability of understanding their mechanism, without pre- viously knowing the instruments by which they are put in order and motion. Descrip- tive Anatomy is in itself so dry and uninterest- ing, that it is absolutely necessary to throw over its details, the fascinating study of Phy-

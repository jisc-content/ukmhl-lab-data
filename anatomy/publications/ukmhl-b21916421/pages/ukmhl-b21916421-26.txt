INTRODUCTORY LECTURE.â€™ 24 it gelatinizes spontaneously, and gradually separates into a whitish coagulum, and a transparent colourless serum, possessing, like the blood, the property of spontaneous coagu- lation. The difference betwixt blood and chyle, merely consists in the colouring matter, and the albumen which it contains, slightly differs from that existing in the blood ; so it appears that in the circulation, the colouring matter is formed, and the albumen perfected. This fluid, and those eliminated from the blood, will be reconsidered in our Lectures upon digestion and the secretions in general. Now we will proceed to a close investigation of the solids. The solid parts of the body, are the organs which determine the form, and impart move- ment to the body. However numerous the organs appear, they may be brought to a cer- tain number of tissues, which, according to Meckel, are again capable of being reduced to microscopical globules like those of the blood, and a coagulable matter. This is certainly an anatomical refinementj but

INTRODUCTORY LECTURE, 4-c. m $»»m- • Gentlemen, IN entering upon the important, intricate, yet pleasing study of Anatomy, it may be ne- cessary to give a kind of sketch or general history explanatory of its object 5 the result of which, I trust, will show that it is not only interesting to the medical philosopher, but profitable to mankind, and as civilization or knowledge advances, so will prejudices against dissections vanish, and the study of Anatomy, be further facilitated. Anatomy has for its object the exact des- cription of parts, which by their union con- stitute the human body. It is the science of organization. Man, the most complicated of all organized beings,is the principal subject of this science, a knowledge of the different parts of which the human body is composed, is indeed the essential end of Anatomy.

Besides a watery fluid, the blood is composed of serum, the cruor, and fibrin, or the coagu- lable lymph. The serum is the chief cause of the ropiness of the blood, and contains water, albumen, some salts, and a great quantity of mucus. The cruor consists of globules, and has many peculiarities, which has excited great atten- tion, and given rise to many experiments.

INTRODUCTORY LECTURE. 31 three classesâ€”animal, vital, and generative, which is a modification of Bichat^s arrange- ment. The latest physiological writer is Bostock, who divides the functions into the contractile, sensitive, and intellectual; in which, he has imitated Plato, who distin- guished them into the vegetative, sensitive, and rational, placing the first in the belly, the second in the chest, and the third in the head. Novelties of expressions are not novelties of ideas 5 so how careful we should be in assign- ing to authors originality. Modern physiolo- gists have written a great deal upon life and organization, and assumed to themselves much credit in sending to the world original doc- trines and arguments, but most of them may be referred either to Lucretius or Aristotle. Gradual developement and perfection in organized bodies, is presented to the attentive * observer. One period is that of growth and perfection, characterizing youth ; another is that where organization remains in a state of maturity; a third, is that where in the organs are progressively changed, that lead to death and dissolution.

INTRODUCTORY LECTURE. 27 coveries in Physiology, whose deathless fame, no admirer of science can contemplate, but with feelings of the most ardent enthusiasm. The anatomical world can boast of only one Bichat: in my opinion, his talents have never been equalled. He was one of those men who give* a character to the age in which they live 5 his career in this world, though short, was long enough to procure for him immortality. To an inventive genius and amazing industry, he added a brilliancy of imagination, which is diffused throughout his works, that has a tendency to lead unguarded minds unhesitatingly to conviction. Read his works, and learn to appreciate his merit. Bedard has reduced the elementary tissues to the cellular, nervous, and muscular. The cellular tissue is the most important in the body, and may be said to form the basis of organization. The terms tissue, fibre, or organ, may be thought vague or indefinite; so the better to understand them, I will explain their meaning.

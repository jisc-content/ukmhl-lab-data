10 INTRODUCTORY LECTURE. friment from inorganic matter, changes its properties and prepares it for animal food by the operations of vitality. From this subject let us ascend to animal and vegetable Physiology, and show the rela- tions they bear to each other. The difference betwixt vegetables and ani- mals is less striking, therefore more difficult to define. Indeed there is very little diffe- rence betwixt a zoophite and a plant, but that is more marked, as we ascend in the scale of the creation. However, we can as- sign to the vegetable kingdom a character which does not coalesce with the other two kingdoms previously mentioned. In conse- quence of their greater proportion of solids to liquids, they retain their bulk longer. Azote predominates in animal substances, which renders them volatile and diffusible; whereas vegetables are of a more fixed and solid na- ture on account of the predominance of carbon. This circumstance combined with their small quantity of liquids, account for their long duration after death.

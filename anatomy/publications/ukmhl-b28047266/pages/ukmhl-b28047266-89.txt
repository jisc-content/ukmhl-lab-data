MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM. 83 sternum,—into the lower border and inner surfaces of the 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th costal cartilages. Action, to draw down the cartilages in expiration. Nerves, intercostal. Levatores Costarum,17 Fis-40 (12), each from the transverse process of a dorsal vertebra,—into the upper surface of the next rib below, near its angle. Action, to raise the ribs. Nerves, intercostal. Diaphragm, from the ensiform cartilage,4 inner surfaces of 6 or 7 lower ribs, ligamenla arcuata,5 and by its crura8 10 from the bodies of the lumbar ver- tebrae, from the 2d to the 4th on the right side, the 2d and 3d on the left,—into the cen- tral or cordiform ten- don.2 3 Action, the great muscle of respi- ration and expulsion. Nerve, the phrenic. Openings of the Dia- phragm. The Aortic,11 in the middle line pos- teriorly, and behind the diaphragm; trans- mits the aorta, vena azygos major, and tho- racic duct, occasionally the left sympathetic nerve. The CEsopha- geal,12 in the muscular structure, transmits the oesophagus and the pneumo- gastric nerves. The Opening for the Vena. CavcN is the highest, and has 4 tendinous margins. The Right Crzis* transmits the sympathetic and greater and lesser splanchnic nerves of that side. The Left Crus,10 the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves of the left side and the vena azygos minor. Descent of the Diaphragm. Its central tendon does not descend during in- spiration, being connected with the deep cervical fascia by the fibrous pericardium. Fig. 42. MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM. Sphincter Ani,4 from the tip of the coccyx and superficial fascia,—into the tendinous centre of the perineum. Action, to close the anus. Nerve, hemorrhoidal branch of the pudic.

9 A COMPEND OF ANATOMY. Define the term Anatomy. Derived from the Greek (iva ana, through, and TEfivav iemnein, to cut, it strictly means dissection, but is technically applied to that science which treats of the structure of organized bodies. What are the divisions of Descriptive Human Anatomy ? They are,â€” Osteology, the anatomy of the bones; Syndesmology, of the joints; Myology, of the muscles; Angiology, of the vessels; Neurology, of the nerves; Splanch- nology, of the internal viscera; Adenology, of the glands; Dermatology, of the ;i skin; Genesiology, of the generative organs. State the number of Bones in the Adult Human Skeleton. It is variously j stated by different anatomists. Excluding the teeth, the Wormian and sesa- moid bones, and the ossicles of the middle ear, the whole number would be 200; excluding also the 2 patellae, and the hyoid bone, would leave in the skeleton proper 197 bones. Describe the Long Bones. They number 90, act as supports, or levers, ft and are known by having a medullary canal in the centre of each, a shaft % (diaphysis), and two extremities. They are developed by osseous deposit in ft cartilage. Describe the Short Bones. Numbering 30, they are found where strength <1 is required, but limited motion. They also are developed by osseous deposit 1 in cartilage. B # ^ Describe the Flat Bones. They number 38, protect the viscera by forming $ i^alls around them, and afford extensive attachment for muscles. They are a developed by osseous deposit in membranes, and consists of 2 dense layers, h separated by a cellular or cancellated osseous tissue, the diploe. What are the Irregular Bones ? They are 39 in number, and include the a vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, the temporal, ethmoid, and sphenoid bones, and the d bones of the face, except the nasal, lachrymal, and vomer.

THE FEMALE PERINEUM. 233 perineum, its posterior commissure approaching the anal margin within about an inch. Superficial Fascia,—is incomplete, by reason of its perforation by the orifice of the vulva, but consists of two layers, as in the male. Deep Perineal Fascia,—being also perforated by the vagina, is less apparent than in the male, though presenting two layers, with the urethra perforating them, as in the other sex. Muscles,—the Sphincter Vaginae takes the place, in the female, of the Accelerator Urinse of the male. Prostate Gland is wanting,—but its place is occupied by a number of minute glands disposed around the neck of the bladder.

MUSCLES OF THE BACK. 79 Spinalis Dorsi, from the last 2 dorsal and 1‘IG- 4°* first 2 lumbar spines,—into all the remaining ,4 ^ dorsal spines. Action, to erect the spinal column. Nerves, branches of the dorsal. Spinalis Colli, from the 5th and 6th cervical spines, sometimes from the 1st and 2d dorsal,—into the spine of the axis, or the 3d and 4th cervical spines. Action, to steady the neck. Nerves, branches of the cervical. [This muscle is frequently ab- sent.] Biventer Cervicis, from the transverse pro- cesses of 2 to 4 upper dorsal vertebrae,— into the superior curved line of the occipi- tal bone. [Is but a portion of the corn- plexus muscle.] Complexus,8 by 7 tendons from the tips of the transverse processes of the 7th cervical and 3 upper dorsal vertebrae, and from the articular processes of the 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical,—into the inner depression between the curved lines of the occipital bone. Ac- tion, to retract and rotate the head. Nerves, suboccipital, great occipital, and branches of the cervical nerves. Semispinalis Dorsi,10 from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae, from about the 5th to the nth,—into the last 2 cervical and 4 upper dorsal spines. Action, to erect the spinal column. Nerves, branches of the dorsal nerves. Semispinalis Colli,11 from the transverse processes of the 4 upper dorsal vertebrae, and the articular processes of the 4 lower cervical,—into the 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th cervical spines. Action, to erect the spinal column. Nerves, branches of the cervical. Multifidus Spinae,16 from the back of the sacrum, posterior superior spine of the ilium, posterior sacro-iliac ligaments, articular processes of lumbar and cervical vertebrae, and the transverse processes of the dorsal,—into the laminae and spines of the next 4 vertebra; above. Action, to erect and rotate the spinal column. Nerves, posterior spinal branches.

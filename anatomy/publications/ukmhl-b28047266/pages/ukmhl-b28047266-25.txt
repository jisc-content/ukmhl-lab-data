19 THE SPHENOID BONE. The ANTERIOR surface is nearly vertical, and presents the— Lamella, in the median line, articulating with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, and forming part of the nasal septum. Opening of the Sphenoidal Sinuses,e or cavities in the body of the bone which exist in adults, not in children. Sphenoidal Turbinated Bones (pyramids of Wistar), which partially close the sinuses, and articulate with the ethmoid and palate bones. The inferior surface helps to form the nasal fossae, and presents the— Rostrum,d which articulates with a groove on the vomer. Vaginal Processes, i on each side of the rostrum. Pterygo-palatine Grooves, which, with the sphenoidal processes of the palate bones, form the pterygo-palatine canals, for the transmission of the pterygo- palatine arteries and nerves. Describe the Greater Wings of the Sphenoid. Each wing, on its superior surface, presents the following points, viz.— Foramen Rotun- Fig. 4. dump for the superior max- illary division of the 5th. Foramen Ovale p for the inferior maxillary divi- sion of the 5th nerve, the small petrosal nerve, and the small men- ingeal artery. Forainen Vesalii, transmitting a small vein. Foramen Spinosum,10 transmitting the middle meningeal artery. The anterior surface assists in forming the external wall of the orbit, the spheno-maxillary and sphenoidal fissures. It articulates with the frontal and malar bones, and presents a— Notch, transmitting a branch of the ophthalmic artery. Spinef for part of the lower head of the external rectus muscle. External Orbital Foramina, transmitting arterial branches. The external surface presents the following points,— Pterygoid Ridge, dividing the temporal fossa from the zygomatic. Spine of the Sphenoid,u to which are attached the internal laternal ligament of the lower jaw, and the laxator tympani muscle.

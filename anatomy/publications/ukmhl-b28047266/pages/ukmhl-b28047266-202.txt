VISCERAL ANATOMY. the mucous lining of the pharynx, Eustachian tube, tympanum and mastoid cells; also with that of the frontal,a ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses/the antrum, nasal duct, and the conjunctiva. It is covered with columnar epithe- lium, ciliated throughout most of its extent, provided with mucous glands, and in its deeper layer with the— Olfactory Cells of Schultze, — spindle - shaped, epi- thelial structures grouped around and between the columnar epithelial cells, and joined together by their anastomosing pro- cesses, to form an intri- cate plexus on which the terminal fibres of the ol- factory nerve are sup- posed to be distributed. Name the Arteries of the Nose. They are the— Lateralis Nasi,—branch of the facial, to the alee of the nose. Nasal of the Septum,—from the superior coronary artery, to the septum. Nasal,—branches of the ophthalmic and infra-orbital, to the dorsum and sides of the nose. Name the Arteries of the Nasal Fossae. They are the— Anterior and Posterior Ethmoidal,—from the ophthalmic. Spheno-palatine,—branch of the internal maxillary. Alveolar,—branch of the internal maxillary, to the antrum. What Nerves supply the Nose ? Branches from the facial, infra- orbital and infra-trochlear, and a filament from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. What Nerves supply the Nasal Fossae ? They are the— Olfactory or ist Cranial,e—over the upper third of the septum nasi, and over the superior and middle turbinated bones. Nasal Branch of the Ophthalmic, S—to the septum and outer walls. Anterior Dental Branch of the Superior Maxillary,/■—to the inferior meatus of the nose and the inferior turbinated bone. Spheno-palatine Ganglion,—sends branches to the septum and the superior turbinated bone,—the Superior Nasal Br. to the same parts,—the Naso- palatine to the middle of the septum,—and the Anterior Palatine to the middle and lower turbinated bones.

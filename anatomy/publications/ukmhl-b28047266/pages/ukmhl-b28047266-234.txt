FEMORAL HERNIA. Where and What, is the Femoral Canal? The Femoral or Crural Canal lies beneath Poupart’s ligament,1 close to the inner side of the femoral vein 4 ; and extends from the Femoral Ring to the Saphenous Opening in the fascia lata of the thigh. It is a narrow interval between the femoral vein and the inner wall of the Crural Sheath or sheath of the vessels. The canal is X *° Y* inch in lengtli; is closed above by the Septum Crurale, below by the Cribriform Fascia ; and contains only some loose areolar tissue and a few lymphatic vessels. The— Femoral or Crural Ring,—is an oval-shaped opening, about y2 inch in situated below the internal abdo- minal ring 7 and Poupart’s liga- ment,1 and between the inner side of the femoral vein and the mar- gin of Gimbernat’s ligament.5 It is closed by the Septum Crurale and a small lymphatic gland. The arrow in the figure goes into the femoral ring. Saphenous Opening,2—is an oval- shaped structure, \]/2 inch long, ]/2 inch wide, situated below the inner third of Poupart’s ligament, and formed by a reflection inwards of the fascia lata around the end of the internal saphenous vein.3 The outer margin curves over to the spine of the pubes, and is named the Falci- form Process, or Ligament of Burns, its pubic end being often called the Ligament of LLey. The inner margin curves upwards behind the saphenous vein and under the outer margin, and is blended with the pubic portion of the fascia lata over the pectineus muscle. The opening is covered by the Cribriform Fascia. What are the Boundaries of the Femoral Canal ? ^ Anteriorly,—Poupart’s ligament, Transversalis fascia, and the Falciform Pro cess of the fascia lata. Posteriorly,—Iliac fascia, and Pubic portion of the fascia lata. Externally,—the Septum covering the femoral vein.

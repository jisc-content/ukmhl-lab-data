251 TABLES AND PLATES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. Note.—These Tables are of original arrangement, and are designed to show the origin, formation and distribution of each nerve. They are generally self-explanatory. That for the 2d Cranial (Optic Nerve) is too long for the width of the page, and breaks at the Optic Commissure, which is repeated again where the table continues below. Sam’l O. L. Potter.

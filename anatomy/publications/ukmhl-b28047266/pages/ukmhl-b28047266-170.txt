They are folds of peritoneum con- necting the stomach with other organs, and are 3 in number, namely, the— Gastro-colic or Great Omentum,14—consists of four layers of peritoneum, the most anterior and posterior of which belong to the greater sac, the two inter- nal to the lesser sac. The two anterior layers descend from the stomach and the spleen, over the small intestines, and then ascend as the posterior layers, to enclose the transverse colon. Gastro-hepatic or Lesser Omentum,—con- sists of two layers of peritoneum, the upper belonging to the greater sac, the lower to the lesser sac. It extends from the transverse fissure of the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach, and con- tains in its right free margin the— Hepatic Artery. Portal Vein. Lymphatics. Ductus Communis Choledochus. First part of the Duodenum. Hepatic Plexus of Nerves. Gastro-splenic Omentum,—connects the stomach with the spleen, and is con- tinuous by its lower border with the great omentum. It contains the Splenic Vessels and the Vasa Brevia. What are the Mesos or Mesenteries ? Folds of peritoneum connect- ing the various parts of the intestinal canal (except the duodenum) to the abdominal walls. Each one contains the vessels of the part which it sup- ports. They are the— Mesentery proper .19 Meso-ceeeum. Meso-colon.2 8 Meso-rectum. What Ligaments are formed by the Peritoneum ? They are 17 folds of peritoneum which support certain organs, viz.— 1 Gastro-phrenic,—from the stomach to the diaphragm. 4 Hepatic—the longitudinal, coronary, and 2 lateral ligaments of the liver. 5 Vesical\—the false ligaments of the bladder. 6 Uterine,—2 vesico-uterine, 2 recto-uterine, and 2 lateral or broad liga- ments of the uterus. 1 Splenic,—the suspensory ligament of the spleen.

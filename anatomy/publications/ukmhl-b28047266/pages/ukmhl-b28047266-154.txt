VISCERAL ANATOMY. 148 diaphragm to the cardiac orifice of the stomach, opposite the 9th dorsal vertebra, where it terminates. It lies in the neck, between the trachea and the vertebral column, resting in part on the longus colli muscle; then inclining to the left side it reaches the posterior mediastinum behind the left bronchus. Describe its Structure. The (Esophagus has three coats, a— Mucous,—in thick longitudinal folds, containing compound racemose glands, and covered with a thick layer of squamous epithelium. Cellular,—forms a loose connection between the other two coats, and con- tains the oesophageal vessels. Muscular,—having longitudinal fibres externally, circular fibres internally, which are continuous with the fibres of the stomach below, and with those of the inferior constrictor muscle above. Name its Vessels and Nerves. The (Esophageal— Arteries, are chiefly branches from the thoracic aorta. Veins, empty into the vena azygos minor. Nei~ves, are branches of the pneumogastric and the cervical sympathetic, form- ing the (Esophageal Plexus. THE STOMACH. Describe the Stomach. It is the principal organ of digestion, pyriform in shape, of musculo-membranous structure, about 12 inches long by 4 inches in average diameter, held in position by the lesser omentum, and situated diagonally across the upper abdomen, in the epigastric and right and left hypo- chondriac regions, above the transverse colon, below the liver and diaphragm. It presents for examination a— Fundus or Splenic End, connected to the spleen by the gastro-splenic omentum. (See under Peritoneum.) Pylorus or Lesser End,—lies in contact with the anterior wall of the abdomen, the under surface of the liver, and the neck of the gall- bladder, its position being near the end of the carti- lage of the 8th rib. Greater Curvature,d —is con- vex, and is connected to the colon by the gastro-colic omentum. (See under Peri- toneum.)

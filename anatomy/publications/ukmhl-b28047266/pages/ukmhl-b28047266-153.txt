147 THE CESOPHAGUS. What are its Anterior Attachments ? The internal pterygoid plate, pterygo-maxillary ligament, lower jaw, base of the tongue, cor- nua of the hyoid bone, stylo-hyoid ligament, thyroid and cricoid cartilages of the larynx. Name the Openings into the Pharynx. They are 7, viz.— 2 Posterior Nares, Mouth LarYnx- 2 Eustachian Tubes. Oesophagus. Describe its Structure. The pharynx is composed of 3 coats,—a mucous, a muscular and a fibrous, the latter lying between the other two, and sometimes called the Pharyn- geal Aponeurosis. The mucous coat is covered with ciliated columnar epithelium above the level of the floor of the nares—below that level by squamous epithelium ; and contains simple follicular glands, also compound folli- cular and racemose glands, the latter being most numerous in the upper part, between the two Eustachian tubes. Fig. 68. Name its Muscles, Arteries and Nerves. Its— Muscles, 5, — are the Superior, Middle and Inferior Constrictors, Stylo-pharyngeus, and Palato Pharyngeus. [See pages 73, 74.] Arteries number 4, as follows,— Superior Thyroid Branches. | Branches of Ascending Pharyngeal. / Ext. Carotid. Pterygo-palatine. Descending Palatine. Nerves,—Branches of the Pharyngeal Plexus, which is formed by the pharyngeal branches of the pneumogastric, glosso-pharyngeal, superioi laryngeal, and superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. j. Branches of the Internal Maxillary. 9 THE CESOPHAGUS. Describe the CEsophagus. It is a musculo-membranous tube, about c. inches long, extending from the 5th cervical vertebra and the lower border of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx, through the oesophageal opening in the

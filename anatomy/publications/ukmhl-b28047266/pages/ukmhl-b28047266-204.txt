Fig. 98. 198 VISCERAL ANATOMY. Name the Tunics of the Eyeball. They number 3, and are named as fol- lows : the— Sclerotic 3 and Cornea,l—the exter- nal and protective tunic. Uveal Tract,—or vascular tunic, comprising the Choroid,4 Ciliary body and the Iris,8 within which is the— Retina,11—the innermost, nervous tunic. Name the Humors of the Eyeball. They also number 3, as follows:— Aqueous,2—in the anterior 2 and middle 9 chambers. Crystalline,—forming the crystal- line lens.1 5 Vitreous,1*—in the posterior chamber of the eyeball. The Sclerotic and Cornea. Describe the Sclerotic. The Sclerotic or hard coat is the posterior five- sixths of the external tunic of the eyeball, the anterior one-sixth being the Cornea. Externally it is of a white color, covered anteriorly by the conjunc- tival mucous membrane, posteriorly being continuous with the sheath of the optic nerve. Internally its color is brown, and its surface marked by grooves for the ciliary nerves. The optic nerve pierces it posteriorly, also the long and short ciliary arteries, posterior ciliary veins and short ciliary nerves. In the equatorial region it is pierced obliquely by the venae vorticosae, and around the corneal border by the anterior ciliary arteries and veins. It is composed o( connective tissue with elastic fibres, intermixed with pigment cells, and cells resembling the corneal corpuscles. It presents for consideration the following points, viz.:— Thickness,—inch posteriorly, inch anteriorly. Lamina Fusca,—a layer of very fine connective tissue, connecting the sclerotic with the outer surface of the choroid. * Lamina Cribosa,—the posterior perforated portion of the sclerotic, which at this point is a thin, cribriform lamina. Its largest opening transmits the arteria centralis retinae, and is named the Torus Opticus, or Optic Canal. Sub-conjunctival Tissue,—connects the conjunctiva with the outer surface of the sclerotic.

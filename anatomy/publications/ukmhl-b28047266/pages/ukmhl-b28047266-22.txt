ANATOMY. Fig. 2. 16 Opening of the Canal of Hugier, lies in the angle between the squamous and petrous portions of the bone; and transmits the chorda tympani nerve. Temporal Ridge,/ in part. Describe the Mastoid Portion. It projects like a nipple from the inferior portion of the bone posteriorly. Internally it is grooved for the lateral sinus ;9 externally are seen the— . Mastoid Foramen f the largest of several foramina, for a vein. Mastoid Process, at the tip, for the sterno-cleido-mastoid, splenius, and trachelo-mastoid muscles. Digastric Fossa,J for the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. Occipital Groove,8 for the occipital artery. Mastoid Cells, in the interior of the mastoid process, open on the posterior wall of the middle ear, and are lined with mucous membrane. Describe the Petrous Portion. It is very hard, pyramidal in form, con- tains the internal and middle ear, projects inwards and forwards, and presents a base, an apex, three surfaces, and three borders. Meatus Auditorius Ext emus,i the external opening of the ear. Auditory Process, a bony ring for the external cartilage of the ear. Apex lies internally, at the base of the skull, forming the outer boundary of the foramen lacerum medium, and contains the internal carotid canal. Anterior Surface, presents from within, outwards— Opening of the Carotid Canal/1 for the internal carotid artery and plexus. Depression, for the Gasserian ganglion of the 5th pair of cranial nerves. Hiatus Fallopii, for great petrosal nerve and an artery. Foramen, for small petrosal nerve. Eminence, over the superior semicircular canal of the ear. Depression, over the tympanum. Posterior Surface, presents— Meatus Auditorius Internus/ transmits the 7th and 8th pairs of cranial nerves and the auditory artery, and lodges a process of dura mater. Opening of the Aqueductus Vestibuli,13 transmits to the vestibule a small artery and vein, and lodges a process of dura mater. • On the Base are seen, the—

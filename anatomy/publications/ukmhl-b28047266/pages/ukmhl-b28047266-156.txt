VISCERAL ANATOMY. 150 Simple Solitary Glands are found scattered along the lesser curvature, and near the pyloric tnd. Name the Vessels and Nerves of the Stomach. Its Arteries are the Gastric^, arising from the Coeliac Axis.

Nerves, are terminal branches of the right and left pneumogastrics, and branches of the semilunar ganglia of the sympathetic, forming the Gastric Plexus. THE SMALL INTESTINE. Describe the Small Intestine. It is a convoluted, tubular, digestive organ, about 20 feet in length, held to the spinal column by the mesenteric portion of the peritoneum, and divided into 3 parts, the— Duodenum,—about 12 fingers (10 inches) long, ascends for 2]/2 inches to the under surface of the liver and the neck of the gall-bladder,—descends for 2)% inches in front of the right kidney,—and passes transversely for 4 inches to the left, across the spinal column, to the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, where the superior mesenteric artery crosses its junction with the jejunum. The duodenum has no mesentery, is partially covered with peritoneum, and surrounds the head of the pancreas. Into its descending portion open the ductus communis choledochus/ and the pancreatic duct. 'ejunum,—about two-fifths of the rest of the small intestine, its coils lying around the umbilical region. It is named from the fact that it is tisually found empty (jejunus) after death. Ileum,—comprises the remainder of the small intestine ; is named from its twisted course, lying below the umbilicus, and terminating in the right iliac fossa, at the ileo-caecal valve, or valve of Bauhin. What Coats has the Small Intestine ? Three, a mucous, a sub-mucous or cellular, and a muscular coat. Its peritoneal investment is sometimes de- scribed as a fourth coat, but incorrectly. The— Fig. 71.

135 THE SPINAL NERVES. Fig. 63. Describe the Lumbar Plexus. It is formed by communicating loops from the anterior branches of the first 4 lumbar nerves, in the following manner. From the First lumbar nerve are given off the— Ilio-hypogastric, to the abdominal and gluteal regions. Ilio-inguinal, to the inguinal region and the scrotum. Communicating Loop, to the second lumbar nerve. From the Second lumbar nerve are given off the— External Cutatieous, to the integument of the outside of the thigh. Genito-crural, to the spermatic cord and front of the thigh. Communicating Branch, to the third lumbar nerve. From the Third and Fourth lumbar nerves are given off the following by a branch of origin from each, viz. Obturator, through the obturator foramen to the ex- ternal obturator and adductor muscles and the hip- and knee-joints. Accessory Obturator (often absent), to the pectineus and hip-joint. Communicating, from the 3d lumbar to the 4th. Communicating, from the 4th lumbar to the 5th. Anterior Crural, which descends through the psoas muscle, and beneath Poupart’s ligament to the thigh, where it divides into an anterior and pos- terior division. Its branches are,— To the Iliacus muscle. Long Saphenous. To the Femoral artery. Muscular. Middle and Internal Cutaneous. Articular. Describe the Sacral Plexus.^ It is formed by the anion of the upper 4 sacral nerves^ with the 5th lum- bar and a loop from the 4th, the two latter forming the I.umbo-sacral Cord a It lies upon the pyriformis muscle and gives off the following 5 branches, viz.— Superior Glutealp from the lumbo-sacral cord, sup- plies the glutei and tensor vaginae femoris. Muscular Branches, to the pyriformis, obturator interims, gemelli, and quad' ratus femoris muscles. fudicy escapes by the great sacro-sciatic foramen, crosses the ischiatitf

THE LIVER. 155 Lobulus Spigelii,y—behind the transverse fissure, and between the fissure for the ductus venosus and that for the vena cava. Lobulus Caudatus/—a connecting ridge from the lobulus Spigelii to the right lobe; it separates the transverse fissure from the fissure for the vena cava, and forms the roof of the foramen of Winslow. Describe the 5 Hepatic Vessels. They are the — portal vein/ hepatic artery/ hepatic duct,/ and lymphatics, situated in the transverse fissure, and surrounded by the capsule of Glisson,—also the hepatic veins in the fissure for the vena cava. The— Portal Vein,s—formed by the superior and inferior mesenteric, splenic and gastric veins (all the main veins of the abdomen except the renal), is about 4 inches long. It enters the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into two branches, and these again divide and subdivide to ramify throughout the gland. Its branches are the— Lobular Plexus. (Fig- 74-) Right Portal. Inter-lobular Veins.1 Left Portal. Lobular Veins.3 Vaginal Branches. Intra-lobular Veins.4 Hepatic Veins,—are the continuations of the intra-lobular, beginning as the Sub-lobular Veins beneath Fig. 74. 3 each lobule, and entering the inferior vena cava in the fis- sure for that vessel. Hepatic Artery/—the nutrient vessel of the liver; arises from the coeliac axis, enters the transverse fissure, and di- vides into branches which supply the cellular tissue, the ^ walls of the vessels, and the investing membranes of the ^ liver, also forming a plexus in each lobule which anasto- moses with the terminal branches of the portal vein. Hepatic Duct,—about \]/z inch long; is formed in the trans- verse fissure by the union of the two main biliary ducts, from the right and left lobes. It joins the cystic duct from the gall-bladder to form the Ductus Communis Chol6do- chus. (See next page.)

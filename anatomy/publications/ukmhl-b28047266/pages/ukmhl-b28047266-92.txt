Nerve, supra-scapular. Teres Minor, from the upper two-thirds of the dorsal surface of the axillary border of the scapula,—into the lowest facet on the greater tuberosity of the humerus, and the bone below. Action, to rotate the humerus outwards. Nerve, circumflex. Teres Major, from the dorsal aspect of the inferior angle of the scapula,— into the internal bicipital ridge of the humerus. Action, to assist the latis- simus dorsi. Nerve, subscapular. ) v Coraco-brachialis,n/}w;z the apex of the coracoid process2 of the scapula, PIG ^ —into a ridge on the inner side of the shaft of the humerus, about its middle. Action, elevates the humerus forwards and inwards. Nerve, mus- culo-cutaneous, which perforates this muscle. Biceps15 (Biceps Flexor Cubiti). Long head8 from the upper margin of the glenoid cavity, short head12 from the apex of the coracoid process,2 in common with the coraco-brachi- alis,—into the back of the tuberosity of the radius, and the fascia of the forearm.20 Action, to flex and supinate the forearm, and to make tense its fascia. Nerve, the musculo- cutaneous. Brachialis AntFcus,17 from the lower half of the shaft of the humerus anteriorly and later- ally, embracing the insertion of the deltoid,9— into the base of the coronoid process of the ulna.19 Action, a flexor of the forearm. Nerves, musculo-cutaneous and musculo-spiral. Triceps16 (Triceps Extensor Cubiti), by three heads, the outer and inner from the posterior surface of the shaft of the humerus, the outer above, the inner below the musculo-spiral groove; the niiddle or long head from a de- pression below the glenoid cavity of the scapula, —into the upper end of the olecranon process of the ulna. Action, to extend the forearm. Nerve, musculo-spiral.

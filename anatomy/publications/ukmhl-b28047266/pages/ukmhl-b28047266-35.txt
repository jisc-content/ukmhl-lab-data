29 THE ORBITS. THE ORBITS. Describe the Orbital Cavities. The orbits are 2 conoidal cavities, situated between the forehead and the face, their bases outwards, their apices pointing backwards, the lines of axial prolongation meeting at the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone. They contain the organs of vision with their appendages, and are each formed by 7 bones,—the frontal,1 ethmoid,2 sphe- noid,3 4 5 lachrymal,6 superior maxillary,7 palate,8 and malar,9 of which the first three are common to both orbits. Each orbit communicates with 1 cavity and 4 fossae, as follows, viz.— Cavity of the cranium, by the optic foramen 11 and sphenoidal fissure.10 Fossce (4)—the nasal, temporal, zygomatic, and spheno-maxillary,—by the nasal duct12 and the spheno-maxillary fissure.13 What Foramina communicate with each orbit? Nine,—the optic foramen,11 sphenoidal fissure,10 anterior21 and posterior22 ethmoidal foramina, supraorbital,14 infraorbital,15 and malar foramina,16 the nasal duct,12 and the spheno-maxillary fissure.13 Describe the Roof of the Orbit. Formed by the orbital plate of the frontal bone anteriorly,1 and the lesser wing of the sphenoid4 pos- teriorly, it is concave, and presents the— Lachry7?ial Fossa,11 at its outer angle,for the lachrymal gland. Depression,18 at the inner angle, for the pulley of the superior oblique. Describe the Floor of the Orbit. Formed by the orbital surface of the superior maxillary bone,7 and the orbital process of the malar9 and palate bones,8 it is nearly flat and presents the— Palato-maxillary Suture poste- riorly. Infraorbital Canal, and a De- pression for the superior oblique muscle of the eye, anteriorly. Infraorbital Groove,19 poste- riorly. 3*

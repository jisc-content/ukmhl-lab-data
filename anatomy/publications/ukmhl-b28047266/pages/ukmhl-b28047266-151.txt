145 THE TONGUE. Openings of the Ducts of Rivinus,—8 to 18 on each side from the sublingual glands, near the frenum of the tongue. The longest is the Duct of Bartholine, which opens into the duct of Wharton. Where are the Salivary Glands ? The Parotid Gland1 lies below and in front of the external ear,—the Sub-maxillary 3 and Sub-lingual5 Glands lie in the corresponding fossae on the inner surface of the inferior maxillary bone. [See Fig. 66.] Describe the Tongue. The tongue consists of extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, a hyo glossal membrane and a mucous membrane, a median fibrous septum, vessels and nerves. Its Base is attached to the hyoid bone, the epi- glottis, the soft palate and the pharynx. Its Under Surface s attached to the hyoid bone and the inferior maxillary. Its mucous membrane is reflected over the floor of the mouth to the inner surface of the gums, forming in front a fold, the Frenum Linguce. The Tongue presents— Filiform Papillce, along its sides, closely packed in rows. Fungiform Papillce,2 scattered over the anterior two-thirds of its dorsum. Circumvallate Papillce,* 7 to 12 in number, in two rows, forming a V at the base of the tongue, meeting at the Foramen Ccecum, which contains the central papilla. Fig. 67. Follicular Glands, posteriorly to the circum- vallate papillae. Racemose Glands, over the dorsum, sides, and under surface. Beneath the tip they form two small oblong masses. Extrinsic Afuscles, are the stylo-, hyo-, genio- hyo-, and palato-glossus muscles. [See pp. 73, 74-] Intrinsic Muscles, are the several fibres of the lingualis muscle,—superior, inferior, trans- verse and perpendicular. Name the Arteries of the Tongue. They are the— Lingual, branch of the external carotid,—with its branches, the— Dorsalis linguae. Sub-lingual. Ranine. Sub-mental, branch of the facial,—anastomoses with the sub-lingual. Ascending Pharyngeal, branch of the external carotid,—sends some small branches to the pharynx and tongue. J

112 ANATOMY. Fig. 59. Superficial Epigastricp to the superficial fascia of the abdomen. Superficial Circunifiex Iliac fi to the skin over the iliac crest. Superficial External Pudicfi to the integu- ment of the lower abdomen, penis, and scrotum. Deep External Pudicfi to the skin of the scrotum and perineum. Profunda Femorisp arises posteriorly about 1 or 2 inches below Poupart’s liga- ment, and descends to the lower third of the back of the thigh, giving off the fol- lowing branches:— Ext. Circumflex. ,r Int. Circumflex./ 3 Perforating/ Muscular Branches, k to the sartorius and vastus internus. Anastomotica Magna, arises from the femo- ral in Hunter’s canal, and divides into a superficial and deep branch, the latter anastomosing around the knee-joint with the superior external and internal articu- lar arteries, and the recurrent tibial. Describe the Popliteal Artery. It extends from the opening in the adductor magnus to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where, having passed behind the knee-joint, it divides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. Its branches are as follows :— Superior Muscular Branches. Inferior Muscular, or Sural. Cutaneous Branches. Superior External Articular. These are distributed around the knee-joint in a free anastomosis. The azygos branch perforates the posterior ligament of the joint to reach the internal ligaments and the synovial membrane. Describe the Anterior Tibial Artery. It extends from the bifurcation of the popliteal to the front of the ankle-joint, where it becomes the Doj'salis Pedis. It passes between the two heads of the tibialis posticus, over the upper edge of the interosseus membrane and along its anterior surface, resting on Superior Internal Articular J Azygos Articular. Inferior External Articular. Inferior Internal Articular.

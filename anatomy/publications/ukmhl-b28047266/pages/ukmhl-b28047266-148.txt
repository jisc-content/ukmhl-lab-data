142 VISCERAL ANATOMY. Pulp-cavity,—in the interior, opening at the apex of the fang for the entrance of vessels and nerves. State the Characteristics of each class of Teeth. Incisors, or Cutters.—Crown chisel-shaped, beveled posteriorly. Fang single, long, thickest antero-posteriorly. Canines, or Tearers,—Crown thick and conical. Fang longest and thickest of all the teeth, forming a projection on the alveolar arch. The 2 upper canines are the “ eye-teeth.” Bicuspids,—Crown has 2 cusps. Fang single but grooved deeply, showing a marked tendency to bifurcate. „ Molars, or Grinders,—Crown large, low and cuboid in shape, has 4 cusps on upper molars, 5 on the lower ones. Fangs multiple, usually 3 on the first two upper molars, 2 on the first two lower ones; the third molar of either jaw, having but one fang, is called the “ wisdom tooth,” and is the smallest of the three. The 2d or yd Temporary Molar is larger than the first. Describe the Structure of a Tooth. Each consists of— Dentine or Ivory,2—composed of tubules sur- rounded by the inter-tubular tissue or Matrix, and opening into the pulp cavity. It resembles compact bone in appearance and in composi- tion, consisting of 28 parts Animal matter and 72 Earthy matter. The Tubules are delicate wavy canals, diameter about of an inch, which branch outwardly and anastomose with each other, forming concentric shadings or Sc Meyer's Lines. Enamelp—covers the crown; consists of very dense tissue, which contains but 3^ per cent, of animal matter. It is covered by a very delicate epithelial cuticle, Nasmyth's Membrane, which when intact withstands the action of acids. Crusta Petrosa or Cementp—the enamel of the fang; is a layer of true bony tissue, containing lacunae, canaliculi, and Haversian canals. Pulp,—fills the pulp-cavity and is prolonged into the dental tubules; is soft, vascular, and sensitive; and consists of connective and fibrous tissue,

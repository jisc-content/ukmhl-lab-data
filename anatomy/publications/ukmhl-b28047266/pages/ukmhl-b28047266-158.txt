152 Fig. 72. VISCERAL ANATOMY. Ascending Colon,—extends upwards to the under surface of the liver, where it forms the Hepatic Flexiire of the Colon. Transverse Colon, ^—crosses the abdominal cavity just below the liver, galb bladder, stomach and spleen, to the left hypochondrium, where it ter- minates in the Splenic Flexure oj the Colon. Descending Colon, e—passes down- wards in front of the left kidney to the left iliac fossa, where it forms the— Sigmoid Flexure of the Colon,/-— curved like an f, first upwards, then downwards; extending from the crest of the left ileum to the left sacro-iliac synchondrosis. Rectum, ^—from the last-named point to the anus; is 6 to 8 inches long, not sacculated, and, though not straight, is straighter than the rest of the gut. It curves laterally to the middle of the sacrum, and back- wards about an inch above its ter- mination at the Anusf where it is distended into a pouch. This lower inch has no peritoneal investment. Appendices Fpiploicce,—are small pouches of peritoneum containing fat, and found along the colon and part of the rectum. They are due to the incom- pleteness of the investment of the gut by peritoneum. Sphincters of the Rectum are 3,—the sphincter ani, internal sphincter and sphincter tertius of Hyrtl. (See ante, pp. 83, 84.) Folds of Houston,—three semilunar transverse folds, one in the upper part of the rectum on the right side, another about the middle on the left side, and the third in front, opposite the base of the bladder. What Glands are found in the Large Intestine ? The Follicles of Lieberkuhn are more numerous here than elsewhere, also a few Solitary Glands and Peyer's Patches in its upper portion. The glands of Brunner are absent, the villi and valvuloe conniventes are almost wanting. State the Principal Relations of each of the three parts of the Rectum. They are as follows, viz.— Upper Part (4 inches),—lies on the left pyriformis muscle and the left

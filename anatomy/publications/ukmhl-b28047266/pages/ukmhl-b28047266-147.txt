What is the Alimentary Canal ? A musculo-membranous tube, from 25 to 30 feet in length, extending from the mouth to the anus, lined throughout with mucous membrane, furnished with several accessory organs, and perform- ing the functions of ingestion, digestion, and egestion. Name its Subdivisions. They are the Mouth, Pharynx, (Esophagus, Stomach, Small Intestine (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) and Large Intestine (caecum, colon and rectum). The first three lie above the diaphragm, the rest below it. Name the Accessory Organs of Digestion. They are—the Teeth, Salivary glands (parotid, sub-maxillary, sub-lingual), Liver, Pancreas and Spleen. THE TEETH. What are the Teeth ? They are 32 organs of digestion (20 being tempo- rary, or milk-teeth), situated one-half in each jaw, imbedded in the alveolar processes, and partly surrounded by the Gums, which are composed of fibrous tissue and covered with mucous membrane. In each half of each jaw there are— Temporary Teeth (5)—2 Incisors, 1 Canine, 2 Milk-molars. Permanent Teeth (8)—2 Incisors, 1 Canine, 2 Bicuspids, 3 Molars. What are their General Characteristics ? Each tooth presents a— Crown, or Pody,—the part seen projecting above the gum. Neck,—the constricted portion between the crown and the fang. Pang, or Root,—imbedded in the alveolus ; and surrounded by the periodental membrane or periosteum lining the alveolus.

206 VISCERAL ANATOMY. Others admit a hyaloid membrane surrounding the vitreous, but deny that it splits to enclose the lens, and assign but one layer to the suspensory ligament, namely, that in front of the Canal of Petit. [Gray, etc.] Describe the Muscles of the Eyeball. They number 6, of which 4 are Recti and 2 Oblique, as follows:— Rectus Superior,5—from the upper margin of the optic foramen and the sheath of the optic nerve,—into the sclerotic coat. Action, to rotate the eyeball upwards. Nerve, 3d cranial. Rectus Inferior,6—from the ligament of Zinn,—into the sclerotic coat. Action, rotates the eyeball downwards. Nerve, 3d cranial. Rectus Internus,4—from the ligament of Zinn,—into the sclerotic coat. Action, rotates the eyeball inwards. Nerve, 3d cranial. Rectus Externus,2—by two heads, the upper from the outer margin of the optic foramen, the lower from the ligament of Zinn and a bony process • Fig.102. at lower margin of the sphenoidal fissure,—into the sclerotic coat.10 Action, to rotate the eyeball outwards. Nerve, 6th cranial, or abducens. Between the two heads of the external rectus pass the 3d, nasal branch of the 5th, and the 6th cranial nerves, and the ophthalmic vein. Obliquus Superior,1—from about a line above the inner margin of the optic foramen, its tendon passing through a “ pulley ” 12 near the internal an- gular process of the frontal bone and thence beneath the rectus superior, —into the sclerotic coat, at right angles8 to the insertion of the rectus superior. Action, to rotate the eyeball on its antero-posterior axis. Nerve, 4th cranial, or patheticus. Obliquus Inferior,9—from the orbital plate of the superior maxillary,— into the sclerotic coat below the insertion of the external rectus and at right angles thereto. Action,to rotate the eye on its antero-posterior axis. Nerve, 3d cranial.

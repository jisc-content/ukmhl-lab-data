THE RIBS. 39 Headia is divided by a ridge into 2 facets, which articulate with the facets on the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae ; the ridge giving attachment to the in- terarticular ligament. Neck, about an inch long, having attached to its upper border the anterior costo-transverse ligament, to its posterior surface the middle costo-trans- verse ligament; its anterior surface is smooth. Tub e r osi tyj> at the junc- tion of the neck with the shaft, has a facet for articula- t i o n with the trans- verse pro- cess of the next lower vertebra, and a rough surface for the posterior costo-transverse ligament. Shaft, twisted on itself, is concave internally, convex externally, its upper* border round and smooth, its lower border grooved^ for the intercostal vessels and nerves. At its external extremity^1 is an oval depression for the insertion of the costal cartilage. Angles just in front of the tuberosity, is marked by a rough line, to which are attached the muscles of the deep layer of the back. How are they developed ? Each rib has 3 centres, one each for the head, shaft, and tuberosity. The last 2 ribs, having no tuberosity, are devel- oped each by 2 centres. Describe the Peculiar Ribs. They are the 1st, 2d, 10th, nth, and 12th. They respectively present the following peculiarities, viz.â€” 1st Tib, is broad, short, not twisted, has no angle, only one facet on the headbut on its upper surface are seen two grooves for the subclavian ar- tery^ and vein/ and between them a tubercle g for the scale- nus anticus muscle. 2d Rib, is not twisted, its tuber- osity and angle are very close together, and its upper surface presents rough surfaces for the serratus magnus and scalenus posticus muscles.

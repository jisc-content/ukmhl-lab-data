201 THE UVEAL TRACT. be attached to the choroid in front of the retina. Consists of meridional fibres drawing the choroid forwards, and circular fibres which relax the zonula and permit the lens to become more convex, from its own elasticity. Annular Muscle of Muller,—consists of separate circular bundles at the anterior internal angle of the ciliary body. Circulus Arteriosus Major and Minor,—are arterial circles on the ciliary muscle, formed by branches of the long posterior ciliary and anterior ciliary arteries. What is the Iris 6 ? It is a perforated curtain, suspended in the aqueous humor behind the cornea and in front of the lens, and is the anterior portion of the middle tunic of the eyeball, being continuous with the ciliary muscle and the choroid coat. It is about \ inch wide, inch thick, and is com- 1 2 3 ~5 -6 posed of radiating and circular muscular fibres, a fibrous stroma and pigment cells, covered by a layer of irregular cells continuous with those of the mem- brane of Descemet. The— Pupil,—is the central opening in the iris, situated a little to the nasal side of the centre, diameter to \ inch. Ligamentum Pectinatum Iridis, or Dollinger’s band,—is the suspensory ligament of the iris, connecting its ciliary margin with the corneo-sclerotic junction. It is formed of strong fibrous prolongations from the membrane of Descemet and the posterior surface of the cornea. Fontana's Spaces,—are spaces between the prolongations which form the ligamentum pectinatum. In some animals, as the ox, they form regular canals.

31 THE FOSS^:. THE FOSSJE. Describe the Nasal Fossae. Together they form the cavity of the nose, being separated from each other by the Septum Nasi.n They open in front by the anterior nares, behind by the posterior nares ; and extend from the palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate bones,17 upwards to the base of the cranium. They are formed by 14 bones,—the ethmoid, sphenoid, frontal, vomer, 2 nasal, 2 superior maxillary, 2 lachrymal, 2 palate, and 2 inferior turbinated. ♦ Describe the Septum Nasi.11 It forms the inner wall of each nasal fossa, and is formed chiefly by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, the vomer, and the triangular cartilage of the septum; to a less extent by 5 other bones,—the rostrum of the sphenoid, the nasal spine of the frontal, and the crests of the nasal, palate, and superior maxillary bones. Describe the points presented by each Nasal Fossa. They are— On the roof. Openings, posteriorly, into the sphenoidal sinuses. Olfactory Foramina, and the Nasal Slit, in the cribriform plate of the eth- moid bone. Sitperior Meatus of the nose, into which open 3 orifices,—those, of the posterior ethmoidal and the sphenoidal sinuses, and the spheno-palatine foramen. Middle Turbinated7 process of the ethmoid. On the floor. Orifice, of the anterior palatine canal. Suture, between the bones forming the hard palate. Nasal Spines, anterior and posterior, and the Ridge connecting them. On the outer wall, from above downwards. Superior Turbinated process of jrIG< 13. the ethmoid. Middle Aleatus of the nose, into which'open 2 orifices,—those of the antrum14 and infundib- ulum,—the latter draining the anterior ethmoidal cells,8 and the frontal sinus. Inferior Turbinated Bone,10 below which is the—

18 ANATOMY. Mastoid Portion 6,—the occipito-frontalis, sterno-cleido-mastoid, splenius capitis, trachelo-mastoid, digastric, and retrahens aurem. Petrotis Portion 3,—the tensor tympani, levator palati, and stapedius. Styloid Process 3,—the stylo-glossus, stylo-hyoid, and stylo-pharyngeus. THE SPHENOID BONE. Describe its Position and Form. Wedged in between the bones of the skull anteriorly, it resembles a bat with out-stretched wings. It is named from the Greek word atpriv sphane, a wedge, enters into the formation of 5 cavities, 4 fossae, 3 fissures, and has— A Body. 2 Greater Wings.2 2 Lesser Wings.1 10 Points of Ossification. 2 Pterygoid Processes. 2 Styloid Processes. 6 Clinoid Processes. 3 Lesser Processes. 12 Foramina. 12 pairs of Muscles. 12 Articulations. Describe the Body of the Sphenoid Bone. Placed in the median line, cuboid in shape, it presents on its Upper Surface from before backwards, the following points, viz.— Ethmoidal Spine? ar- ticulating with the ethmoid bone. A Smooth Surface, grooved for the oh factory nerves. Optic Groove, support- ing the commissure of the optic nerves. Olivary Process, an olive - shaped emi- nence behind the optic groove. Middle Clinoid Processes, bounding the sella Turcica in front. Sella Turcica16 (Turkish saddle), lodges the pituitary body and the circular sinus of the brain. Dorsum Sellce (back of the saddle), grooved for the 6th nerves. Posterior Clinoid Processes,6 for attachment of the tentorium cerebelli. Grooves, laterally, for the cavernous sinus and internal carotid artery. The posterior surface is rough and quadrilateral :15 it articulates with the basilar process of the occipital bone, ossification being completed from the 18th to the 20th year.

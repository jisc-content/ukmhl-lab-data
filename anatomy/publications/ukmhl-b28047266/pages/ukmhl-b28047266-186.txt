Sinus Pocularis, or Uterus Masculinus,9 —a small cul-de-sac situated at the front part of the veru montanum. It extends for jf inch upwards and back- wards into the prostate gland, beneath its middle lobe. Orifices of the Seminal Ducts,—open on the margins of the sinus pocularis.

Its walls are very thin, and almost destitute of erectile tissue. It is surrounded by the compressor urethrae mus- cle, and except the orifice, is the narrowest part of the urethral canal. On its sides are the—■ Ducts of Cowper1 s Glands,16—on their way to open into the bulb of the urethra. (See p. 182.) Describe the Spongy portion of the Urethra. It is about 6 inches long, and has two dilatations, one at each end, named respectively the Bulb and the Fossa Na- vicularis. The— Bulb of the Urethra18—is the upper end of the spongy portion, projects backwards for inch, and contains the orifices of Cowper’s glands. Fossa Navicularis,—is the lower dilatation of the urethra, and is situated within the glans penis. Lacuna Magna,—the largest of several orifices of mucous follicles, situated on the roof of the fossa navicularis. Glands of Littrl,—are numerous mucous glands and follicles, opening into the urethral canal, their orifices being directed forwards.

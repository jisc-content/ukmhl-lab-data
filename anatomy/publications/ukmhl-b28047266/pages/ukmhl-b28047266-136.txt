130 ANATOMY. Fig. 6i. 2d, Optic, nerve of sight,—arises from the optic commissure2 and tracts, deeply from the optic thal- amus, corpora geniculata,and cor- pora quadrigemina; exit through the optic foramen to the retina. [This nerve and the Optic Tract are more fully described at the end of the volume, under the sub-title, Vessels and Nerves of the Eye.] 3d,Motor Oculi,7 motor of the eye, -—arises from the crus cerebri, deeply from the floor of the iter e tertio ad quartam ventriculum ; exit through the sphenoidal fissure, to all the muscles of the orbit except the superior oblique and the external rectus, also to the iris. 1st, Olfactory, nerve of smell,— arises by 2 roots from the anterior cerebral lobe and 1 root from the middle lobe, deeply from the optic thalamus, island of Reil, corpus striatum, and anterior commis- sure ; exit by 20 branches through the cribriform plate, to the Schnei- derian membrane. Its bulb is a lobe of the cerebrum. 4th, Patheticus,8 motor of the eye, — arises from the outer side of the crus, deeply from the valve of Vieussens; exit through the sphe- noidal fissure, to the superior ob- lique muscle of the eye. 5th, Trigeminus,9 nerve of sensa- tion, motion, and taste,—arises by two roots,—from the side of the pons Varolii,5 deeply from the pyramidal body (motor root), lateral tract of the medulla, the pons, and cerebellum (sensory root). Exit of ophthalmic divi- sion by the sphenoidal fissure; of superior maxillary by the fora- men rotundum; of inferior max

175 THE KIDNEYS. THE URINARY ORCxANS. THE KIDNEYS. Where are the Kidneys situated ? Posteriorly in the abdomen, one on each side of the spinal column, behind the peritoneum, and extending from the level of the nth rib to near the crest of the ileum. The right kidney is lower than the left. State their Dimensions. Each one is about 4 inches by 2 by 1, and weighs from 4 to 6 oz. Enumerate their Relations. The— Anterior Surface of the Right Kidney,—is in relation with the right lobe of the liver, descending duodenum, and the ascending colon. Anterior Surface of the Left Kidney,—with the tail of the pancreas, descend- ing colon, and part of the spleen. Posterior Surface,—with the crus of the diaphragm, 1 ith and 12th ribs, psoas magnus, quadratus lumborum, and the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle. Superior Extremity,—is capped by the supra-renal capsule. Describe the Hilum of the Kidney. The Hilum is a fissure on the inner or concave border, leading into the Sinus or cavity of the gland. It contains the— Renal Vein,—in front. Renal Artery,—next in order. Ureter, or Excretory Duct,—behind and below. Describe the Kidney-structure. A vertical section presents the— Pelvis or Sinus,6—the cavity, forming the beginning of the ureter 7 or ex- cretory duct of the gland. Its divisions are the 3 Infundibula 5, and these are again divided into Calices 4 or pouches, into which open the orifices of the pyramids, 1000 orifices situated on each Papilla. Medullary Substance,3—consists chiefly of the tubes of Bellini and Henle, arranged in Pyra- mids of Malpighi, whose apices project into the calices of the pelvis. Cortical Stibstancef—forms the surface of the gland, and consists of uriniferous tubules (straight and convoluted), Malpighian bodies, blood-vessels, nerves, lymphatics, connective tissue, and a granular matrix. It is of a red color, and is prolonged down to the pelvis be- tween the pyramids, these prolongations being named the Columns of Bertin.

143 THE TEETH. nucleated cells, blood-vessels and nerves. The cells are caudate and anastomose with each other, those situated superficially being termed Odontoblasts. What Arteries and Nerves supply the Teeth ? Ihe Arteries are derived from the inferior dental, and from the alveolar and infraorbital branches of the internal maxillary. The Nerves are derived from the inferior dental branch of the inferior maxillary division of the 5th, and also from the anterior and posterior dental branches of the superior maxillary division of the same nerve. When do the Temporary Teeth appear ? Their eruption begins about the 7th month after birth, with the central incisors, and ends with the appearance of the second molars, about the age of two years. The lo^cr teeth slightly antedate the upper. Their formula is as follows : — Mo. Mo. Ca. In. In. In. In. Ca. Mo. Mo.

The first molars appear about the end of the 6th year, followed by the incisors about the 7th or 8th year, the bicuspids from the 9th to the 10th year, the canines about the nth or 12th year, the second molars from the 12th to the 13th year, and the third molars from the 17th to the 25th year. Those of the lower jaw are slightly in advance of the corresponding upper ones. Their formula is as follows :— Wis. Mo. Mo. Bi. Bi. Ca. In. In. In In. Ca. Bi. Bi.

What is the greatest Number of Teeth at one time in the jaws, and when ? Forty-eight, namely, all the temporary and permanent teeth except the third molars,—occurring between the 5th and 7th years of age. Describe the Development of the Teeth. They arise from the mucous membrane covering the maxillary arches, in which, about the 6th foetal week, appears a depression, the Primitive Dental Groove, from the floor of which arise papillae of mucous membrane to form the pulp of the milk-teeth. In the Follicular Stage, membranous septa form across the groove, and its margins become thick and prominent. The Saccular Stage extends from the 13th week to the 16th, and is marked first by the projection of the papillae from the follicles, next by the growth of the follicular margins, the formation of processes or Opercula thereon, which meet and close in the papillae; and finally by the closing in of the dental

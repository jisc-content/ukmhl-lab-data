VISCERAL ANATOMY. 208 Space of Toion,—between the globe and its capsule. Vaginal Spaces,—between the sheaths of the optic nerve. What Veins has the Eye ? It has two main trunks, the Superior and Inferior Ophthalmic Veins, which empty into the cavernous sinus, after col- lecting the blood from the smaller venous channels through the Vena? Vorti- cosce of the choroid. The veins of the eye anastomose freely with the facial veins, thus permitting the escape of venous blood in either direction. Describe the Nerves of the Eye. They are the— Nerve of Special Sense,—the Optic, or 2d cranial nerve. Motor Nerves,—the 3d, 4th, 6th, filaments of the 5th, and some fibres from the sympathetic. Sensory Nerve,—the Ophthalmic Division of the 5th, giving off the— Lachrymal,—to the lachrymal gland, the conjunctiva, and the integument of the upper eyelid. Frontal, f Supra-trochlear.

CILIARY GANGLION 'r IC Sympathetic Branches,—arise from the medulla, cilio-spinal region, cavernous and carotid plexuses, and join the 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th nerves, sending filaments to the dilator fibres of the iris, to the muscles of the orbit and lids, to the ciliary ganglion, and to the walls of the arteries.

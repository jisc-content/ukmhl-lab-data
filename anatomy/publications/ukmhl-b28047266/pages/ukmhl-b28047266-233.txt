INGUINAL HERNIA. 227 What is Poupart’s Ligament ? The Crural Arch or Poupart’s Liga- ment is that portion of the aponeu- rosis of the external oblique muscle which extends from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine of the pubes. Its lower por- tion 3 forms the external pillar of the external abdominal ring,1 and its reflection along the pectineal line is called Gimbernafs Ligament.'1 Other fibres, reflected behind the internal pillar of the ring,4 upward to the linea alba, are termed the Triangular Ligament. What is the Relation of the Epigastric Artery to the Internal Abdominal Ring ? The Epigas- tric artery lies between the trans- versalis fascia and the peritoneum, passing obliquely upwards and in- wards along the lower and inner margins of the internal ring.5 What is the Cremasteric Fascia ? It consists of a series of muscular loops, united by areolar tissue, and forming a thin covering over the spermatic cord. The muscular fibres (Cremaster muscle) are supposed to have been originally part of the Internal oblique muscle, but carried down by the testicle in its descent to the scrotum. It does not exist in the female. Name the Coverings of Inguinal Hernia. In the oblique form of Inguinal Hernia the coverings are— 1. Skin. 2. Superficial Fascia,—2 layers. 3. Intercolumnar Fascia,—from the external abdominal ring. 4. Cremasteric Fascia,—from the inguinal canal. 5. Lnfundibuliform Process of the transversalis fascia,—from the internal abdominal ring. 6. Peritoneujn,—the proper hernial sac. In the direct form of Inguinal Hernia, the coverings are precisely the same, except that the Conjoined Tendon is substituted for the Cremasteric fascia, and the Transversalis Fascia for its lnfundibuliform process. A 7th covering is sometimes enumerated, viz.: the Sub-serous Areolar Tissuer

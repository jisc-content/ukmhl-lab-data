V PREFACE. * THIS book contains the complete text of my two Compends of Anatomy, namely—the “Human Anatomy,” and the “Visceral Anatomy,” heretofore published as separate volumes in this series of students* manuals. The marked favor with which these Compends were first received, some three and a half years ago, has since been continuously extended to them by teachers and students, both in America and in England. This has been manifested by the sale of a new and large edition every year, and has been extremely gratifying to the author. Upon the exhaustion of the third edition, the publishers resolved to acknowledge the universal appreciation shown these books, by incorporating the two in one volume; making this, the first of the now well-known “ Quiz-Compends,” a complete quiz-book on Human Anatomy. In carrying out this generous resolution, the original matter has not been curtailed anywhere; but, on the contrary, much new matter has been introduced wherever greater detail seemed to be desirable, and the number of the illustrations has been increased by eighteen new cuts. Originally designed for the use of the medical student, in pre- paring for the exercises of the quiz-room and for his final exam- ination, the text is confined to the essentials of each structure treated of, which are arranged in such a manner as to facilitate their rapid acquirement. All superfluities of description have been studiously avoided, and only such matter inserted as should be thoroughly known in order to pass a rigid examination on any organ or structure of the human body. The descriptions will be found to closely follow Gray, though Quain and other recognized authorities have been freely consulted during the preparation of the text. For many of the special arrangements

Fig. 32. 59 THE ARTICULATIONS. Describe the Sacro-vertebral Articulation. It is similar to the other ver- tebral articulations, but has 2 additional ligaments on each side, viz.— Lumbosacral, from the transverse processes of the 5th lumbar vertebra to the base of the sacrum laterally and anteriorly. Lumbo-iliac, from the apices of the transverse processes of the 5th lumbar vertebra to the crest of the ilium. Describe the Sacro-coccygeal Articulation. It is an amphiarthrodial joint, and has 3 ligaments, viz.— Anterior Sacro-coccygeal. Posterior Sacro-coccygeal. Interarticular Fibro-cartilage, in the joint. Describe the Sacro-iliac Articulation. It is an amphiarthrodial joint, formed by the auricular surfaces of the sacrum and ilium. Its ligaments on each side are as follows, viz.— Anterior Sacro-iliac. Posterior Sacro-iliac.8 Oblique Sacro-iliac. Describe the Sacro-ischiatic Articulation. Its ligaments convert the sacro-sciatic notches into foramina, the greater notch by the lesser ligament, the lesser notch by the greater ligament. These foramina are described under the ilium and is- chium bones. Great Sacr 0-sciatic Ligament,13 14 from the posterior inferior spine of the ilium and the posterior sur- faces and margins of the sacrum and coc- cyx, to the inner margin of the tuber- osity and the ascend- ing ramus of the ischium. Lesser Sacro-sciatic Ligament,15 16 from the margins of the sacrum and coccyx, into the spine of the ischium. Describe the Pubic Articulation. It is an amphiarthrodial joint, formed by the 2 pubic bones. It has an interarticular fibro-cartilage and 4 ligaments, viz.—■ Anterior Pubic. Posterior Pubic. Supra-pubic. Sub-pubic, forming a fibrous arch between the rami.

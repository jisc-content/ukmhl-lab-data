203 THE RETINA. Optic Disc or Papilla,—the point where the optic nerve enters, the central artery of the retina piercing its centre. It lies about y1^ inch internal to and inch below the posterior pole of the eye, and is often called the Blind Spot, being the only part of the fundus oculi from which the power of vision is absent. Pars Ciliaris Retince,—the part of the retinal stroma which is prolonged over the ciliary body. It is destitute of nerve-elements. Arteries of the Retina,—arise from the Arteria Centralis Retinae (br. of the ophthalmic), just behind the optic disc; run chiefly upwards and down- wards, accompanied by veins, to terminate in capillary network. No vessels exist in the fovea centralis, and only the finest capillaries in the macula lutea. Describe the Structure of the Retina. It is composed of nervous elements, blood-vessels, and modified connective tissue resembling the neuroglia of the brain, arranged in 9 or 10 layers, from within outwards, as follows, viz.— Membrana Limitans Interna,—a perfectly transparent membrane, made up of the retinal connective tissue, and lining the inner surface of the retina (shown in the cut by the lowest line). Optic Nerve Fibres,1—composed of the ter- minal fibres of the optic nerve radiating from the papilla in all directions. They consist of the axis-cylinder only. Ganglionic Layer,2—a very thin layer of large ganglion cells, having large nuclei and nucleoli, with branching processes to the optic nerve fibres of next layer. Internal Molecular Lay erf—fine granules intersected by finest nerve fibres and con- nective tissue elements. Internal Granular Layer f—small, round cells with large nuclei, their processes uniting with the ganglion cells. External Molecular Lay erf—a very thin layer of fine granules and nerve-fibrillae. External Granular Layerf—consists of ellipsoid cells, forming a nucleated en- largement of Jacob’s membrane. Fig. ioo.

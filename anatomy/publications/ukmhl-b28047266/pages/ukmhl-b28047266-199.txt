19S THE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES. THE ORGANS OF SENSE. THE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES. Name the Divisions of the Skin. It is divided into the— c Superficial Epithelial layers. Epidermis, or Cuticle, | Mucosum, the pigmentary layers. Papillary Layerp next below the rete, from which it is separated by a homogeneous basement membrane. ^ Coriumfi the deepest portion. Derma, or Cutis Vera, the True Skin. What Structures lie in and beneath the Skin ? The Sensitive Papillce, containing the Tactile Corpuscles in very sensitive parts,— in the papillary layer of the Derma. Sweat-glands./, g- Hair-roots F ns.n | i.e I Sebaceous Glands.* Fat Cells Ducts of the Sweat-glands. Hair-follicles,—into which most of the seba- ceous ducts open. Ducts of the Sebaceous Glands,—occasionally. In the Sub-cutaneous Cellular Tissue. Perforate both the Derma and the Epidermis. Describe the Structure of the Epidermis. It is an unorganized epithe- lial structure, having no vessels or nerves. The cells of which it is composed are agglutinated together in a lami- nated arrangement, are flat and dry on the surface, round and softer in the central portion, columnar and softest in the deepest layers. The lowest and softest layers are named the— Rete Mucosum,—which is closely moulded upon the papillary layer of the derma, and contains pig- ment cells, to which the color of the skin is due. Describe the Structure of the Derma. The true skin is a highly organized, tough yet elastic tissue, and serves to protect the parts beneath, to perform the functions of excretion and absorption, and as the chief seat of the sense of touch. It consists of fibro-areo- lar tissue, vessels and nerves. The— Fig.96. M

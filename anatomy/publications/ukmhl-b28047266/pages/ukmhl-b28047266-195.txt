189 THE UTERUS AND ITS -APPENDAGES. rior fourth. It is invested by peritoneum posteriorly, and in front for its upper three-fourths. Cervix, or Neck — is the lower constricted portion, about inch long, walls inch in thickness, and is embraced for y2 to y inch by the upper extremity of the vagina. Cavity of the Bodyf—is small and triangular, flattened from before back- wards, about I inch in length, and has two lateral Cornua above, and a constricted orifice—the Os Internum Uteri—at its lower angle, opening into the cavity of the cervix. Cavity of the Cervix,—is spindle-shaped, about i3/g inch long, and presents on its inner surface transverse folds of mucous membrane proceeding from a longitudinal fold, giving an appearance named the Arbor Vitae.o Os Uteri or Os Tinea;,—is a transverse orifice at the lower end of the cervical cavity, opening into the vagina, and having an anterior and a posterior lip. Fig. 94. G Enumerate the Ligaments of the Uterus. The proper ligaments of the uterus are 6 in number,—2 Anterior, or Utero-vesico-pubic, 2 Posterior, or Utero-recto-sacral, and 2 Lateral, or Broad Ligaments, all composed of peri- toneum. The— Broad Ligaments,—pass from the sides of the uterus to the lateral walls of the pelvis, and form a septum across the pelvic cavity. They contain, between the two folds of peritoneum of which they are composed, the Fallopian tubes, the Ovaries, and the so-called Round Ligaments. What are the Round Ligaments of the Uterus ? They are two cords, composed of areolar and fibrous tissue, muscular fibres, vessels and nerves, extending one on each side, from the lateral aspects of the fundus uteri, through the inguinal canals, to the labia majora, where they are lost. Each ligament lies, for a part of its course, between the two layers of the broad ligament, and is covered by a process of peritoneum, (f* Fig. 94.)

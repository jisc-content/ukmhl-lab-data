Aortic Opening,—behind the diaphragm, for the aorta, vena azygos minor, the thoracic duct, and occasionally the left sympathetic nerve. (Esophageal Opening,—in the diaphragm, for the oesophagus, and the pneumo- gastric nerves. Umbilical Opening,—in the anterior wall, transmitting the umbilical vessels in the foetus, but obliterated after birth, leaving a puckered depression, the Umbilicus. Internal Abdominal Ring,—on each side, half an inch above Poupart’s liga- ment, for the passage of the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament of the uterus in the female. Femoral or Crural Ring,—on each side, just below Poupart’s ligament; for the passage of the femoral vessels. This opening is closed by the Septum Crurale. (See Femoral Hernia.) Name the Regions of the Abdomen. The Abdomen is divided into 9 regions, by two horizontal lines,—one between the cartilages of the 9th ribs, another between the crests of the ilia,—and 2 vertical lines from the cartilages of the 8th ribs to the centre of Poupart’s ligament. The 9 regions thus formed are named the— Epigastric. Left Hypochondriac. Umbilical. Left Lumbar. Hypogastric. Left Inguinal. Region ? Right Hypochondriac Region,—contains the right lobe of the liver, gall-bladder, duodenum, hepatic flexure of the colon, upper part of the right kidney, and the right supra-renal capsule. Epigastric Region,—contains the right two-thirds of the stomach, left lobe and lobus Spigelii of the liver, hepatic vessels, coeliac axis, solar plexus, pan- creas, and parts of the aorta, inferior vena cava, vena azygos, and thoracic duct. Left Hypochondriac Region,—contains the splenic end of the stomach, spleen, tail of the pancreas, splenic flexure of the colon, upper half of the left kidney and its supra-renal capsule.

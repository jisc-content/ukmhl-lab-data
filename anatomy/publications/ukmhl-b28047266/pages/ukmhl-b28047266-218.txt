VISCERAL ANATOMY. 212 evaporates, or collects in lacus and passes through puncta into canaliculi, and so to lachrymal sac, and thence, by the nasal duct, into the inferior meatus of the nose. What are the Canaliculi ? They are two minute canals, inch in diameter and y inch long, which extend from the punctum in each lid to the lachrymal sac. They are lined with mucous membrane, and enveloped by fibres of the tensor tarsi muscle. Describe the Lachrymal Sac. It is the superior dilated extremity of the nasal duct, and is situated in the groove formed by the lachrymal bone and the nasal process of the superior maxillary. Its form is oval, flattened antero- posteriorly; its dimensions about f inch long and i inch wide. Its fundus is crossed by the tarsal ligament, and by the tensor tarsi muscle. Its junction with the nasal duct may be interrupted by folds of the lining mucous mem- brane. What is the Nasal Duct ? A membranous canal extending from the lachrymal sac to the inferior meatus of the nose. It is about y inch long, y inch in diameter, is contained in the osseous lachrymal canal, curving down- wards, backwards and outwards, and its calibre is narrowest about its middle. Its mucous lining is thick, and continuous with the Schneiderian membrane of the nasal cavity. Surrounding it is a vascular network of connective tissue, and outside this, a tendinous sheath. At its lower end a fold of mucous mem- brane forms an imperfect valve. Fig. 105. THE EAR. What Bone contains the Auditory Apparatus ? The petrous and mas- toid portions of the Temporal bene.

ANATOMY. 72 Fig- 38. Between the sternal and clavicular origins is a fossa, the fonticulus gutturis, which rises and falls during la- bored breathing. Sterno-hyoid,14 from the posterior surface of the sternum and the sternal end of the clavicle, — into the body of the hyoid bone. Action, to de- press the hyoid bone. Nerve, a branch from the communicating loop between the de- scendens and com- municans noni. Sterno-thyroid,15/r<?w the posterior surface of the sternum and the cartilage of the 1st rib,—into the oblique line on the ala of the thyroid cartilage. Action, to depress the larynx. Nerve, a branch from the communicating loop between the descendens and communicans noni. Thyro-hyoid,16 from the oblique line on the thyroid cartilage,—into the body and greater cornu of the hyoid bone. Action, to elevate the larynx. Nerr>e, hypoglossal. Omo-hyoid,1718 from the upper border of the scapula and the transverse ligament,—into the body of the hyoid bone. It has a tendon in its centre which is bound down to the cartilage of the 1st rib by a loop of the deep cervical fascia. Action, to depress the hyoid bone, and draw it backwards. Nerve, branch from the communicating loop between the descendens and communicans noni. Digastric, by 2 bellies, the posterior onex from the digastric groove of the mastoid process of the temporal bone; the anterior2 from a fossa on the inner surface of the inferior maxillary, near its symphysis,—into a central tendon 3 which perforates the stylo-hyoid muscle, and is bound down to the body of the hyoid bone by an aponeurotic loop. Action, to raise the hyoid bone and tongue. Nerves, facial, and mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior dental. Stylo-hyoid,4 from the styloid process of the temporal bone near its base,— into the body of the hyoid bone. Action, to elevate and retract the hyoid bone. Nerve, facial. This muscle is perforated by the digastric.

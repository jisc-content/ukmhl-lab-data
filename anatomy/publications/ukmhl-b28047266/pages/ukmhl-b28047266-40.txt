ANATOMY. 84 To the Body,—the genio-, mylo-, stylo-, sterno-, thyro-, omo-hyoid, the genio* hyo-glossus, and the hyo-glossus muscles; also the pulley of the digas- tric, the hyo-epiglottic ligament, and the thyro-hyoid membrane. To the Greater Cornu,—the hyo-glossus, middle constrictor muscles, and part of the thyro-hyoid;—also the thyro-hyoid ligament. To the Lesser Cornu,—the stylo-hyoid ligament. TABLE OF THE FORAMINA AT THE BASE OF THE SKULL, with the various structures transmitted by each. Anterior Fossa contains I single foramen and 5 in pairs, viz.— Foramen Ccecum,—lodges a fold of dura mater, and transmits a vein to the longitudinal sinus from the nose, sometimes one from the frontal sinus. Ethmoidal Fissure,—the nasal nerve, and the anterior ethmoidal artery. Olfactory,—olfactory nerves, and nasal branches of the ethmoidal arteries. Anterior Ethmoidal,—anterior ethmoidal artery and the nasal nerve. Posterior Ethmoidal,—posterior ethmoidal artery and vein. Optic Foramen,—optic nerve and ophthalmic artery. Middle Fossae contain 8 pairs, viz.— Foramen Lacerum Anterius, or Sphenoidal Fissure,P—the 3d, 4th, oph- thalmic division of the 5th, and the 6th cranial nerves, and filaments of the sympathetic ; ophthalmic vein, a branch of the lachrymal artery, orbital branches of the middle meningeal artery, and a process of dura mater. Foramen Rotunaum,—superior max- illary division of the 5th cranial nerve. F'oramen Vesalii, — a small vein. This foramen is often absent. Foramen Ovale, l — inferior max- illary division of the 5th nerve, lesser petrosal nerve, and the small meningeal branch of the internal maxillary artery. Foramen Spinosum,m—middle men- ingeal artery, meningeal veins, and sympathetic filaments from the cavernous plexus.

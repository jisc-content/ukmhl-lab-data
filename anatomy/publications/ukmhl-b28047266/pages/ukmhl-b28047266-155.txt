149 THE STOMACH. Lesser Curvature, *—is concave, and connected to the liver by the gastro- hepatic omentum, and to the diaphragm by the gastro phrenic ligament. (Esophageal Orifice, l—is situated between the fundus and the lesser curva- ture. It is funnel-shaped, and the highest part of the organ. Pyloric Orifice, k—opens into the duodenum, land is guarded by the circu- lar muscular fibres of the pylorus, which are aggregated into a circular ring, projecting into the cavity, and with its covering fold of mucous membrane, forming the Pyloric Valve. Describe its Structure. The Stomach has 3 coats, a— Mucous Coat, g—lined with columnar non-ciliated epithelium, covered with polygonal Alveoli, of an inch in diameter, containing the orifices of the Gastric Follicles. When the stomach is contracted the mucous membrane lies in longitudinal folds or Rugce, b one of which aids in forming the valve at the pyloric orifice. Cellular or Sub-mucous Coat,—contains the gastric vessels. Muscular coat,/— consists of longitudinal, circular, and oblique fibres. The Longitudinal are continuous with those of the oesophagus and small intes- tine, and are the most superficial. The Circular lie deeper, and over the whole organ ; they form a sphincter valve around the pyloric orifice. (See above.) The Oblique Fibres lie deepest, forming two sets around the oesophageal open- ing, in continuation of the circular fibres of the oesophagus. The Serous Invest- ment of the stomach is derived from the perito- neum, and covers the whole external surface, excepting the points where the gastro-splenic, greater and lesser omenta are attached. It is usu- ally, but incorrectly, described as a fourth coat of the stomach. Describe the Gastric Glands. They are of 3 kinds, the—- Peptic Follicles,—situated all over the stomach, but most numerous towards the splenic end,—are tubules lined with columnar epithelium in their upper one-fourth, and filled with nucleated cells in their deepest parts.

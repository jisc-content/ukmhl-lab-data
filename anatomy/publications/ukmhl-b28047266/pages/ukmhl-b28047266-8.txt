vi PREFACE. the author is indebted to the lectures of Professor W. H. Pan. coast, late of Jefferson Medical College, and to the quizzes of Dr. Henry Morris, formerly assistant to the Chair of Anatomy in the same school. While striving to carry out the object of this series in furnish- ing the medical student with a condensed Manual of Anatomy, the author has endeavored, from a 'strong appreciation of the importance of the subject, to make this volume deserving of first rank among its kind; and believing that a judicious condensation, which does not slight the essential features of the subjects treated, cannot fail to be of benefit in any department of science, he again commits his Compend to the teachers and students of Anatomy, in the hope that it may continue to be found worthy of a place alongside the more exhaustive and exhausting text- books. January, 1887. Preface to the Fifth Edition. Another edition of this Compend having been exhausted, the publishers have requested me to improve the book in any way which will keep it in the front rank among works of its class. I have therefore added an.Appendix of forty-three pages, con- taining an original and complete set of Tables and Plates of the Arteries, the Cranial and Spinal Nerves and Plexuses, and the Sympathetic Nervous System. These have been prepared especially for this book, and will, I think, prove of very great value to the student in college, and the physician in practice, who desires a comprehensive view of these complicated parts of the human organism.

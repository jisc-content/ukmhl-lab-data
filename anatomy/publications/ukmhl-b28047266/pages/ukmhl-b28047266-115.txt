Describe the Abdominal Aorta. It begins where the thoracic ends, and terminates at the 4th lumbar vertebra in the common iliacs. Its branches are as follows:— Cceliac Axis,2 arises oppo- site the margin of the dia- phragm, runs forwards for half an inch and divides into the Gastric, Hepatic, and Splenic arteries, occa- sionally giving off one of the phrenics. Gastric,3 supplies the stomach along its lesser curvature, anastomosing with the aortic, patic branches. Hepatic,K divides in the trans- verse fissure of the liver into the right and left branches, to the lobes of that organ; also the— Pyloric. Cystic. Splenicp the largest branch of the coeliac axis, passes by a very tortuous course to the spleen, giving off the following:— Pancreaticse Parvse. Gastric (vasa brevia). Pancreatica Magna. Gastro-epiploica Sinistra. Phrenic} one on each side, but usually only one arises from the aorta, the other springing from either the coeliac axis or the renal artery. They go to the under surface of the diaphragm. Superior Mesenteric,9 supplies the small intestine, caecum, ascending and 10

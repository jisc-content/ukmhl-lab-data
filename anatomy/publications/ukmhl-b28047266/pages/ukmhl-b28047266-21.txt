THE TEMPORAL BONES. 15 and the 2 condyles; its ossification being completed about the 6th year of age. What muscles are attached to the Occipital Bone ? There are 12 muscles attached on each side to the following portions, viz.— Superior Curved Line 3—the occipito-frontalis, trapezius, and sterno-cleido- mastoid. Space betxveen the curved lines 2—the complexus and splenius. Space below the inferior curved line 3—the obliquus capitis superior, rectus capitis posticus major and minor. Basilar Process 3—the superior constrictor of the pharynx, rectus capitis anticus major and minor. Jugular Process 1—the rectus capitis lateralis. THE TEMPORAL BONES. Describe their situation and divisions. They are situated at the inferior lateral portions of the skull, and contain the organs of hearing. Each bone is divided into 3 parts, the Squamous a- (scale-like), Mastoidb (nipple-like), and Petrousc (hard); and it is named from being the site of the first gray hairs [tempus, time). Describe the Squamous Portion. It is a semicircular plate, smooth ex- ternally, and grooved internally for the middle meningeal artery, with de- pressions for the cerebral convolutions. Externally are seen the— Fig. i. \ a I / /inafvi !/, m Zygomatic Process,d or zygoma, arising by 3 roots, and extend- ing forwards to articulate with the malar bone.

Glenoid Fossa,g between the ante- rior and middle roots of the zygo- ma; its anterior part receives the condyle of the lower jaw, and is covered with cartilage; its posterior part lodges the parotid gland. Glasserian Fissure, divides the glenoid fossa; it transmits the laxator tympani muscle, the tympanic artery, and the processus gracilis of the malleus. pi,- "i/'i gal hj

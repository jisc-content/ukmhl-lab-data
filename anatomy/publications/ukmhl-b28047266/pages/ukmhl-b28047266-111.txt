It ascends in front of the transverse processes of the three upper cervical vertebrae, and close to the tonsil, traverses the carotid canal in the temporal bone, and after piercing the dura mater by the anterior clinoid process, divides into its terminal branches. Its branches are the Tympanic, enters the tympanum from the carotid canal, and anastomoses on the membrana tympani with the tympanic branch of the internal max- illary, the stylo-mastoid, and the Vidian arteries. Arteria Receptaculi, numerous small vessels going to the walls of the sinuses, the Gasserian ganglion and the pituitary body; one of them, to the dura mater, is called the Anterior Meningeal. Ophthalmic, arises from the cavernous portion, enters the orbit through the optic foramen, terminating at the inner angle of the eye into the frontal and nasal branches. It gives off,â€” Lachrymal.

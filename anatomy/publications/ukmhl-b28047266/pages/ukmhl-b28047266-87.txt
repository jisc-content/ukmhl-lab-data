MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 81 ment,—into the cartilages of 4 lower ribs; by its aponeurosis into the linea alba; and leaving an arched border20 over the spermatic cord, by the con- joined tendon19 with the transversalis into the pubic crest and the pectineal line. Its aponeurosis splits at the rectus abdominis for its upper three-fourths, one layer passing in front, the other behind that muscle, to unite again at the linea alba; for its lower one-fourth it passes in front of the rectus.

Transversalis, from the outer one-third of Poupart’s ligament, the anterior two-thirds of the inner lip of the crest of the ilium, the cartilages of 6 lower ribs, and an aponeurosis from the spines and transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae,—by its aponeurosis into the linea alba, and by the con- joined tendon19 with the internal oblique, into the pubic crest and the pectineal line. Its aponeurosis passes behind the rectus abdominis for its upper three-fourths, in front of that muscle for its lower one-fourth. F

156 Fig. 75 VISCERAL ANATOMY. Lymphatics,—accompany the blood vessels in two sets, a superficial set and a deep one. What Nerves supply the Liver? Branches of the Hepatic Plexus, which is formed by branches derived from the left pneumogastric, right phrenic and solar plexus. Describe the Structure of the Liver. The substance of the liver is composed of numerous Lobulesj1 of polygonal shape, and about of an inch in diameter, clus- tered around the sub- lobular branches of the hepatic veins, and con- nected together by con- nective tissue,3 blood vessels, ducts,2 and lym- phatics. Each lobule consists of— Hepatic Cells, — each about the of an inch in diameter, having a nucleus and nucleolus, yellow coloring matter, glycogen granules, and oil globules. Lobular Veins 3—forming a plexus in the lobule. 1 _ r , , , - . . , . ^ (See Figs. 74, 75.) Intra-lobular Veiny—in the centre of each lobule. J Plexuses,—of lymphatics, nerves, and bile-ducts. What is the Capsule of Glisson ? The areolar tissue which surrounds the hepatic vessels in the transverse fissure, and accompanies them in their course throughout the substance of the liver. It is continuous with the fibrous covering of the organ. How may the Portal Veins be distinguished from the Hepatic, on section of the Liver ? The portal veins remain closed, being surrounded by the capsule of Glisson. The hepatic veins gape open, being adherent to the liver substance. Describe the Gall-bladder. It is a pear-shaped bag, 3 to 4 inches long, an inch in greatest diameter, holding from 8 to 12 fluid drachms, invested by peritoneum on its under surface and fundus, formed of a fibro- muscular coat and lined by a mucous one, lying in a fissure on the undei surface of the liver, dose to its anterior border, and directed obliquely down- wards, forwards, and to the right.

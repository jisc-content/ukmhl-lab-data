The lung has a serous coat (the pleura) ; a sub-serous, elastic areolar tissue, investing the entire organ, and ex- tending inwards between the lobules ; and the parenchyma, or true lung-tissue, composed of— Fig g5 Lobules,—each consisting of several air- cells or compartments, arranged around the termination of a bronchiole, and surrounded by 6 plexuses of pulmon- ary and bronchial arteries and veins, lymphatics and nerves. Each lobule is a miniature lung, pyramidal in form, with base outwards, and about inch in diameter. Alveoli, or Air-cells,—are separated from each other by thin septa, are lined with pavement epithelium on a base- ment membrane, and vary in diam- eter from to inch. [See Fig. 85-1 Name the Vessels and Nerves of the Lungs. The lungs are nour- ished by the bronchial arteries, and supplied with blood for oxygenation by the pulmonary arteries. Bronchial Arteries,—are derived from the thoracic aorta. Pulmonary Arteries,—are derived from the right heart. Bronchial Veins,—open on the right side into the vena azygos, on the left side into the superior intercostal vein. Pulmonary Veins,—open by 4 large orifices into the left auricle of the heart, carrying oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. Lymphatics,—terminate in the bronchial glands. Nerves,—are branches from the pneumogastric and the sympathetic, form- ing the Anterior and Posterior Pulmonary Plexuses, from which filaments are distributed to each lobule.

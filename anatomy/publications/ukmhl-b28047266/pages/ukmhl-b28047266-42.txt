36 ANATOMY. THE BONES OF THE TRUNK. THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. What Ctiaracteristics are Common to the Vertebrae ? Each vertebra consists of a body and an arch, the latter being formed by 2 pedicles and 2 laminae, which support 7 processes. Body6 is thick and spongy, convex in front7 from side to side, concave verti- cally, and on the upper and lower surfaces, which are surrounded by a bony rim. Anteriorly are small foramina for nutrient vessels, posteriorly a large foramen for the exit of the venae basis vertebrarum. Pedicles, project backwards from the body, inclining outwards. They are notched above and below, thus forming, with the adjacent notches, the Intervertebral Foramina for the entrance of vessels and the exit of the spinal nerves. Lamina,2 are 2 broad plates, meeting in the spinous process behind, and rough on their upper and lower borders for the attachment of the liga- mentum subflava. Transverse Processes} one Fig. 15. on each side, projecting outwards. Articular Processes, two on each side, superior3 and inferior,5 project from the junction of the laminae and pedicles, and articu- lating above and below with the articular pro- cesses of the adjacent vertebrae. Their superior facets look upwards in the cervical region, out- wards in the dorsal, and inwards in the lumbar. Spinous Process} projects backwards from the junc- tion of the laminae with each other, sometimes very obliquely. Spinal Foramen,9 is the space enclosed by the body, pedicles, and laminae; and which, when the vertebrae are articulated, forms part of the spinal canal.

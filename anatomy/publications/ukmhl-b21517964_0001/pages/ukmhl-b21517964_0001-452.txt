432 CASE OF CLOSURE OF THE CHIEF ARTERIES functions unimpaired, excepting there was occa- sionally some slight confusion of mind and a verti- ginous feeling, especially in suddenly rising from the horizontal or reclining to the erect posture. All the senses were ordinarily unaffected: the sight, the hearing, the smell, and taste, were commonly as acute as ever, and the general functions of the sys- tem were well performed ; so that, had not the an- eurism burst into the cavity of the pericardium, life might have been continued with ease and enjoyment, and no doubt would have been so continued, had a channel for the passage of the blood been formed through the fibrinous mass in the aneurism instead of below it. As the circumstances under which the post-mortem inspection was instituted did not admit of minute examination, much less of the injection of the ves- sels, the manner in which the circulation was carried on above the obstructed vessels can only be con- jectured. The intercostal arteries, especially the superior, were probably the ones chiefly concerned in effecting a communication, either with the pervious principal arteries springing from the innominata, and their branches, or the probably pervious branches, given off by the left subclavian and carotid arteries. As supplementary to this case, I shall briefly notice another, in which also there is reason to believe, that the same great vessels were perma- nently obstructed, as in the preceding, but with a train of symptoms and an event very different.

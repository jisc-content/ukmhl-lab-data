In this way a great many preparations may be introduced into the same vessel,â€”indeed the vessel may be almost filled with them without detriment, provided each is free, and not pressed against by another, which is easily managed by using threads of different lengths. This method, it may be added, is particularly well adapted for sending preparations to England, on account of its economy, the little space required, and its security. Using it, there is no danger of the preparations being left dry and ruined by the capillary action of threads sucking up the spirit, and draining the vessel, the cerate pre- venting such action; nor is there any danger of at- mospheric air finding admission, provided the glass stopple or cork with which the bottle is closed is covered with moist bladder firmly tied down, and smeared with oil when dry ; nor of any material loss from evaporation. Here a caution may be given, that when bladder is thus used, the bottles should be placed out of the reach of rats, mice, and cockroaches, animals greedy of this membrane, and who attack it whenever it comes in their way. Numbers written with a lead pencil on slips of strong paper, parchment, or wood, may be intro- duced with the preparations when they are numerous and there is any apprehension of mistake; which numbers will of course Tave reference to a descrip-

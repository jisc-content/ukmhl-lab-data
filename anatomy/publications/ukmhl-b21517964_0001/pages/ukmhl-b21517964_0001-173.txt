ON ANIMAL HEAT. 153 cate thermometer introduced into the central part of the brain. 1. Brain - 104° Rectum - 104*75 2. Brain - 105*75 Rectum - 105*5 3. Brain - 105*5 Rectum - 106*5 4. Posterior part of the brain 105*5. Anterior 103°. Rectum 106*5. The temperature of the air at the time was 68°. Different parts of the brain were found to vary con- siderably in temperature; the anterior, as already noticed, being lower than the posterior, and the superficial than the deep-seated parts. 3—Remarks and Conclusions. That there is no material difference between venous and arterial blood in respect to specific ca- loric, excepting what arises from difference of spe- cific gravity; that the temperature of arterial blood is higher than that of venous; and the temperature of the left side of the heart than that of the right; and lastly, that the temperature of parts diminishes as the distance of parts from the heart increases,— are the general results of the preceding experi- ments. Admitting the accuracy of these experiments, and I think that they will be found correct when re- peated, what are their consequences in a theoretical point of view ? They are evidently in direct opposition to Dr. Crawford’s hypothesis, the essence of which is, that

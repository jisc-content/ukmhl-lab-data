The liver was very red, and gorged with blood; the lungs were rather red, condensed, and contained little air. The ventricles of the heart were distended with blood, the right ventricle especially ; the right auricle was less dis- tended, the left auricle was empty.

The muscle, under the wound was nearly black, there were air-bubbles in the ad- joining cellular membrane ; there was no offensive smell from it: the body was still warm.

The lungs were rather redder than natural. The muscular fibre in general

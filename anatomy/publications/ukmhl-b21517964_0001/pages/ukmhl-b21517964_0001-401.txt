ON ANIMAL TEXTURES. 381 putrefying matter. In one instance, of an abscess in the liver, which was opened by the knife, this acid, diluted with water, was employed, at my recommen- dation, and apparently with very good effect; for, although air got admission, putridity was prevented. Whether vinegar is efficacious, as a means of fumigation, for which purpose it is still commonly employed, it is not easy to decide. Its properties, on the whole, are rather unfavourable to its efficacy,— at least permanently. However, as it insures, by the pungency of its fumes thorough ventilation,—as it is most easily applied,—has no noxious quality that is known ;—and, its activity, when concentrated, is cer- tain and considerable,—perhaps it deserves the good opinion it has gained, and it may be right to con- tinue the employment of it, as at present, when slight fumigation only is required, and there is no suspicion of the presence of any pestiferous fomes. As vinegar dissolves tannin with facility, and in considerable quantity, it may be added, with good effect, in tanning such parts of the body, as it may be thought desirable, by this process, to convert into dry preparations. The addition of the acid insures the advantage of preventing putrefaction,—and the consequent destruction of delicate organization. I have by me, thus tanned, the stomach with part of the oesophagus, its Epithelium adhering, the valve of the colon and some other parts of the intestines. They display accurately, not only the forms and strik- ing peculiarities of these organs, but also their delicate

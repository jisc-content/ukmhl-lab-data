The heart, however, was still felt pulsating on the right side, and a fluctuation of fluid in air could be heard in the left side, on shaking, or suddenly moving the body. The following week the symptoms were less favourable, and those of hydrothorax especially were more severe. When the patient attempted to lie on the right side, he was instantly seized with a fit of coughing ; and when the body was shaken the sound of fluid fluctuating in air in the left pleura, was distinctly audible even at the distance of several yards. As the patient’s health was pretty good, it was deemed advisable, to repeat the operation of para- centesis and draw off the fluid, before the case became desperate. Having, in cases of empyema, found some incon- veniences attending the puncturing of the pleura, between an intercostal space, I was induced, in this instance, to follow the method described by Hippo- crates, of perforating one of the ribs.* The fifth rib was selected; and having cut down upon it with a scalpel, just below the papilla of the breast, I bored through its substance with a carpenters’ auger, and punctured the pleura with a small trochar, as nearly as possible of the same size as the auger.

ANIMAL MATTER IN DIFFERENT BONES. 389 In this First Table of results, the specimens of bones from No. 1 to 17, were miscellaneous, from Dr. Monro’s museum; they belonged, it is under- stood, to natives of Great Britain. Some were recent and moist; others dry, but not deprived of hygrometrical moisture before being subjected to trial. They afford proof, at least, that the propor- tions of calcareous and of animal matter in different bones of the same body, are, as indeed might be expected a priori, somewhat different. The specimens, the subjects of trial, extending from No. 18 to 71, were from the museum at Fort Pitt. Previous to incineration, they were thoroughly dried, by exposure on a stove to a temperature of about 212°, till they ceased to lose weight. This is a circumstance of some importance in compara- tive experiments: if neglected, the results will be of little value for the purpose of comparison, whether the bones are recent, impregnated with their peculiar fluids, or dried by exposure to the air.* * The variable proportion of the peculiar fluids of recent bones, is, 1 believe, as great, if not greater, than of the solid contents : the recent parietal bones of Nos. 42 and 43, lost by drying, the former 18'49 per cent., the latter 23. The proportion of liygrometrical water is always changing in bone, as in other porous substances, ac- cording to the state of atmosphere in relation to humidity. I have found apparently dry bone lose by the expulsion of its hygrometri- cal water from 4 to 7 per cent. The power of absorbing moisture by different bones, probably varies with their other qualities, as is witnessed in substances generally, and especially those used as arti- cles of dress : I may offer an experimental illustration, and I am the more disposed to do so, as the subject has not received that attention.

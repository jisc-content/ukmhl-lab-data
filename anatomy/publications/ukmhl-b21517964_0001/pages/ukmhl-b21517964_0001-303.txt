EFFECTS OF THE SUN’s HAYS ON THE SKIN. 283 bright sunshine, in Corfu, during an hour and a-half, on the 29th July 1826, in the middle of the day, when the thermometer was at 78° in the shade. At the end of that time the skin was slightly painful, red, and hot. On the 1st August, the erythema was nearly in the same state; during the night the redness of the skin had been heightened, and the sensation of pain increased. On the 2d, there was very little alteration; a thermometer applied to the inflamed part rose to 96°, or 1° higher than when applied to the adjoining skin. On the 3d, desquamation had commenced at the circumference; there, where the cuticle had separated, the part was brownish-red, and not painful. In the middle, where the cuticle firmly adhered, the colour conti- nued to be rose-red, and the pain continued, though in a less degree. This middle part, it may be remarked, in which the erythema was most durable, was most inflamed, the sun’s rays having struck on it perpendicularly ; whilst, on the circumference, from the rotundity of the arm, they impinged on it obliquely. On the 5th, desquamation was making progress; pain had ceased; the part was reddish- brown at the edges, but still red at the centre; the temperature of the part was not above that of the adjoining skin. On the 8th, the part was uniformly of a reddish-brown; desquamation was still taking place, the new cuticle separating almost as fast as it formed, not in continuous pieces, as in the first instance, when the old was detached, but in

434 CASE OF CLOSURE OF THE CHIEF ARTERIES post-mortem examination, the inspection was very partial and hurried. Two pints of serum were found in the left pleura and three in the right. The lungs were not appa- rently diseased. The heart was somewhat larger than natural: its valves were pretty sound, even the semilunar of the aorta. The aorta throughout its arch was enlarged; but only in a moderate degree, and its coats were more or less altered. Its inner coat was irregularly thickened and opaque, and the middle coat corresponding had become thin- ner, and of a heightened yellow tint. Thin plates of bone were formed in, or under the former, and atheromatous matter here and there in the latter, and in one spot matter of this kind, of about the bulk of a peppercorn, soft, brownish, poultaceous, had penetrated through all the coats to the external loose cellular enveloping tissue. The left carotid and subclavian arteries were completely obstructed, firmly plugged up with dense white matter, which it may be inferred was lymph. No trace even of the opening of the carotid from the aorta could be discovered, and a very slight trace only of the other, a little cavity a line or two deep, resembling thr, vestige of the aperture of the ductus arteriosus in the adult. It is to be regretted that in the hurried examination, and owing to interruption, the state of the arteria innominata, and of the right subclavian and carotid arteries was not determined. The de- scending aorta was of its normal dimensions.

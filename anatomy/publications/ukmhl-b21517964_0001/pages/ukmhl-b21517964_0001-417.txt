ANIMAL MATTER IN DIFFERENT BONES. 397 constant in animals of the same natural families, to admit of any satisfactory conclusion being drawn on the subject. Nor is it probable that any such con- clusion can be drawn, until a series of comparative experiments shall have been instituted, conducted with minute attention to accuracy, and under circum- stances, especially as regards the method of prepa- ration, precisely similar. It has been asserted that there is as marked dif- ference in the proportions of the constituent parts of bone of the blood-horse and the cart or dray- horse, as there is in their appearance and some of their physical qualities ; that the former, though stronger and more compact than that of the latter, is of lower specific gravity, and contains a less pro- portional quantity of calcareous matter. To endea- vour to satisfy myself on these points, I have been at some trouble to procure for examination, speci- mens of bone of the varieties of horse in question ; for those of the thorough-bred horse “ Lorenzo” and of a common life-guards’ troop-horse, I am indebted to Mr. Gulliver. The results they have afforded are not in confirmation of the opinion re- ferred to ; they seem rather to favour a conjecture, already proposed, that in relation to strength more depends on the arrangement of the constituent particles than on the proportion of calcareous mat- ter ; and indeed many other of the results of the comparative trials contained in this table, point the same way.

92 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS distension, communicates with the two large veins from which it receives blood by a common passage guarded by two thin semilunar valves. The great veins pass to the auricle through the cartilaginous parieties of the sternum, where they may be consi- dered as sinuses. The brain of the torpedo, as in the cartilaginous fishes generally, does not fill the whole of the cavity of the cranium: the older and the larger the fish is, so much the greater is the space unoccupied by it. This space is commonly filled with a transparent fluid ; I have never found in it any fatty or oleaginous matter. Of the organs of sense, I shall only briefly notice those of sight and smell, which are both very elaborate in structure. The globe of the eye is moved and go- verned by four recti muscles, and one oblique muscle. The olfactory nerve is beautifully distributed on laminae contained in a funnel-formed membrane, not unlike the sclerotic coat of the eye, and its external aperture is defended by delicate cartilaginous folds, covered with skin, somewhat resembling the ex- ternal ear of the mammalia. And it is worthy of remark, further, that the cup or funnel-formed mem- brane, is itself contained in a bony cavity, having resemblance to the socket of the eye. Under the head of the species of Torpedo and its varieties, mention has been made of tbe diversity of colour and of markings exhibited even by the same species. In two instances, in young fishes of the

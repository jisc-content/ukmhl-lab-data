152 ACCOUNT OF EXPERIMENTS was first ascertained, as a means of marking the rate of cooling, and the different parts were then tried in the following order: Venous blood in the jugular vein - 105*5 Arterial blood from the carotid artery 107° Rectum _ _ _ - - 105*5 Over the metatarsal bone - - 97° Over the tarsal bone - - - 90° Over the knee joint . . _ 102" About the head of the thigh - - 103" At the groin - 104“ Nearly a quarter of an hour had been occupied in making these observations, and the temperature of the rectum was now found to be 105“. The three great cavities were next opened in the order enumerated. Near the lower part of the liver - 106“ The substance of the liver - - 106*5 The substance of the lung - - 106*5 The left ventricle . _ . 107® The right ventricle _ _ . 106° The central substance of the brain - 104“ Rectum - - . _ . 104*5 Surprised at the temperature of the brain being lower than that of the rectum, 1 was led to repeat the experiment. It may be proper to notice a few of the results, as it is a curious circumstance which they confirm. The four experiments 1 shall men- tion, were made on lambs. As soon as the animal was dead, the cranium was perforated, and a deli-

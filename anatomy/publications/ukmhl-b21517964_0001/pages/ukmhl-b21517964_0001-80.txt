60 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS intestinal canal, in progress of accumulation.* The branchial filaments have almost entirely disappeared. I shall notice only two stages more of the young torpedo; the one of a fish six weeks old, (fig. 2, Plate V.) in which the internal yolk was considerably diminished in bulk; its connexion with the um- bilicus almost absorbed ; the intestine full of yolk ; the stomach empty, but considerably developed: the other of a fish six months old, (fig. 1, Plate VI.) in which only a very small portion of the internal yolk remained, and the connexion of the inner yolk bag with the umbilicus was absorbed, a vestige only of the canal of communication remaining. These fish, at about the full period of utero- gestation, were extracted from a torpedo just after she had been caught, were instantly put into salt water, and were preserved^ alive. I shall have occa- sion to revert to them further on. * At this period of foetal development the 3mlk has two distiirct membranes, an external transparent one, and an internal vascular one. The former is of great delicacy generally, excepting where the egg joins the abdomen; there it is very thick and strong, and slightly opaque, serving in a manner the part of the sheath of the umbilical cord of the mammalia; it is connected with, and appears to end in the cutis of the abdomen. The latter, the membrana um- bilicalis, or chorion, if it may be so called from its great vascularity, passes into the cavity of the abdomen, and terminates in the vitello- intestinal canal, from whence the internal yolk-vesicle proceeds. Two large vessels (the trunks of the vessels of the chorion) enter the cord-like termination of the egg. One of them terminates in the vena-portse; the termination of the other I have not ascertained in a satisfactory manner; I believe it corresponds, in function, to the umbilical arteries, and brings blood from the foetus to the egg, the other vessel returning it.

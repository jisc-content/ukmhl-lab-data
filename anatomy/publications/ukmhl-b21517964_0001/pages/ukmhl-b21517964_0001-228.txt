208 XL OBSERVATIONS ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SHEEP IN WINTER AND IN SUMMER, The majority of the foregoing observations, seem to show that the temperature of man, and birds, and quadrupeds, is somewhat higher in warm weather than in cool weather,—as in the hot atmosphere of the plains within the tropics, compared with the cool air of the mountains. The observations, how^ever, made by our enterprising arctic travellers, during the depth of winter of intense cold, seem to prove that the animals inhabiting the extreme northern regions have a high temperature, perhaps higher than the same animals in a milder atmosphere. In illustration, I shall insert here the results of some trials made on quadrupeds, by inserting a thermometer several inches into the rectum before the death of the animals, com- monly taken in traps, for which I am indebted to the Rev. G. Fisher. 1821. Nov. 15, White Fox Dec. 3, „ Fahr. 106*75 101*5 Air at the Time. -f 14° — 5°

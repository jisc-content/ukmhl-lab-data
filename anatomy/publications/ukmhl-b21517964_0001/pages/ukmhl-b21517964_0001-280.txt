A remark of Dr. Laennec would seem to counte- nance this notion. He says,—“ M. Ribes assures me, that he has found, on opening the serous cavities of dogs, a small quantity of air constantly to escape.” * On the contrary, in opposition to this, are the expe- riments of Haller and other accurate observers, recorded in the controversy which Hambergerus gave rise to, by reviving and maintaining the opinion of Galen, that air is contained between the lungs and pleura.j" In doubt between these contending authorities, with the desire of satisfying myself on the point, I have made some experiments on dogs, the results of which convince me, that in a healthy state, no air is contained in the pleura of this animal. When I opened under water the chests of dogs killed by drowning, not the smallest globule of air escaped ; but when the right side of the chest was opened in the atmosphere, an appearance presented, at first favourable to the idea of a little air being contained • A Treatise on the Diseases of the Chest, &c., translated from the French of R.

95 OF SOME OF THE AMPHIBIA. each other generally, although in each kind there were minute and trifling differences. In every instance, they were very large, nearly equal in size to the liver; they were long and narrow, and very lobulated; and like those of some of the mammalia, with conglomorate kidneys, they were destitute of a* pelvis, each lobule sending a small duct to the ureter. Each ureter, formed by the union of two branches, terminated in a single papilla, situated in the cloaca, and a little elevated above its surface, the point of the papilla containing its orifice, di- rected towards a receptacle, into which the urine entered. The receptacle here alluded to is a conti- nuation of the intestine, yet it may be considered distinct both from the rectum and cloaca, with which it communicated only by means of sphincter orifices. This conformation of parts was seen to advantage in the larger species of snakes; I first observed it in the python, and in a large coluber, commonly called the Rat-snake, frequently met with from eight to ten feet long. The urinary ducts, even in the substance of the kidneys, were often observed to be of an opaque white colour, owing to a white matter which they contained, which was visible through their trans- parent coats, and which could be expressed from the papilla, and collected in small quantities for examination. More or less of a similar white matter was almost constantly found in the receptacle, generally in soft lumps, rarely in hard masses. In

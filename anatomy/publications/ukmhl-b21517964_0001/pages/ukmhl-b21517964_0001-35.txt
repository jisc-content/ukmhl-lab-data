ON THE TORPEDO. 15 its electricity; the notes of the first successful one bear the date of the 9th of September, 1831. In the autumn and early winter of 1833, I instituted several other trials which were amply confirmatory of the pre- ceding. In these latter experiments I did not, as in the former, coat with sealing-wax the wires introduced into the fluids, leaving the points only exposed. Though the wires were naked, and in every in- stance, introduced more than a quarter of an inch into the fluid, and the distance was at least a tenth of an inch, yet satisfactory results were obtained. Using either a saturated solution of common salt, or a mixture of equal parts of sulphuric acid of com- merce, and water, and platina or gold wires, gas was given off round each wire under the influence of the discharge of the electricity of an active fish, one contact wire being applied to the under surface, and the other to the upper surface of the torpedo. When steel needles were used with the salt water, then gas was disengaged only from the one in con- nexion with the under surface of the fish, the other needle becoming oxidated. Using a strong solution of nitrate of silver, and gold wires, silver was preci- pitated only on that in connexion with the under sur- face ; employing strong nitric acid and platina wires, gas was given off from one only, that in connexion with the upper surface; using a solution of iodide of potassium and starch,* the iodine in combination * When starch, in powder, is added to a saturated, or nearly saturated, solution of the iodide of potassium, a transparent gelatinous

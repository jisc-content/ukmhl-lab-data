AND OTHER ANIMALS. l7l The temperature of one of them was 99*5, of the other two 99°. At the Isle of France, at Port Louis, in June, one of the coolest months there, when the thermo- meter was at 74°, I tried the temperature of three Negroes, two natives of Madagascar, and one of Mozambique. Of these the temperature of the two first was 98", and of the last 99°. They were house slaves, between eighteen and twenty years old, well clothed and fed, and in good health. The temperature of an English gentleman, who had been in the island several years, and of another just arrived, was ascertained at the same time. The former was 98’25, the latter 98*5. In the island of Ceylon I commenced my observa- tions, at Colombo. Colombo, in latitude N. 6° 56', is situated on the sea-shore, at the distance of about thirty miles from the boundary mountains of the Kandian country. Its temperature is remarkably equal; in the hottest day seldom exceeding 84", and in the coolest night rarely falling to 70". The greater part of the year, the range of the thermome- ter is from 77" to 73", and the mean annual temper- ature is about 79°. On the 14th of September, between six and seven o’clock in the morning, in a village about a mile from Colombo, when the air was about 79°, I tried the temperature of six Singalese, of different sexes and ages, all cool and in good health and fasting.

AND OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY. 159 In current of mixed blood, from the great vessels of the neck divided in the ordi- nary manner - 104® Brain at base, after decapitation - 105® Near the surface of cerebrum - 104® Right ventricle (some blood in it) - 106® Left ventricle (empty) - 108® Liver ... - 107® Crystalline humour of the eye - 102® The subjects of these observations, of the 22nd January, were virgin ewes between two and three years old, with the exception of No. 7, which was a wether. These results are generally confirmatory of the preceding, although not without exception in relation to the base of the brain. In another place, further on, I shall have occasion to give some additional observations on this point. That the temperature of the surface of the brain at least should be uniformly less than that of the rectum, appears to me what might be expected d priori, considering the comparatively small supply of blood to that part, and its exposure to cooling influ- ences. In the instance of birds, the effect is very strikingly exemplified ; thus, in the turkey, on the 22d February, when the thermometer in the open air was 34" and the room 46®, in cloaca it was 108®, in the gizzard 109°, under the pectoral muscle 108®, and in the brain 90®. The temperature in cloaca was ascertained during life ; the other observations

146 ACCOUNT OF EXPERIMENTS when the vein or artery had been opened, the bottle was immediately emptied and filled with blood—the temperature of which was ascertained by the thermo- meter in less than a quarter of a minute. The mix- ture was now instantly made, and by the same ther- mometer the highest temperature of the mixture was discovered. The four following trials were made on the blood of two lambs, both about five months old. The temperature of the air was 60®. Cold water 57*5. Venous blood 100®. Mixture 80®; after one minute 78*5. Water 58®. Arterial blood 103®. Mixture 80®; after one minute 79°- Water 58®. Venous blood 101*5. Mixture 79”; after one minute 78*25. Water 58®. Arterial blood 106*5. Mixture 81®; after one minute 80®. The rate of cooling was not noticed after the first minute had elapsed, as the blood then generally began to coagulate. The specific gravity was only ascertained in the two last trials ; that of the venous blood was found to be 1050, and that of the arterial 1049 ; and hence, allowing, as before, one degree of the cooling effect to be produced by the receiver, the capacity of venous blood for heat appears to be 852, and that of arterial blood 839. It is evident that these trials admit of less accuracy than the preceding ; and much more confidence, it appears to me, is due to the third series of experi-

333 VESICUL.E SEMINALES OF MAN. started concerning the nature of the fluid, and the use of the vesiculae seminales ? The first inference that appears to me unavoid- able is, that the vesiculae are seminal reservoirs, according to the old opinion on the subject and that which is still most commonly entertained by the continental physiologists. And next, that they are not merely reservoirs, but are also secreting organs, furnishing mucus, and perhaps some other fluid, for admixture with the semen. The first inference is supported by the general resemblance, in several cases, of the fluid of the vasa deferentia and of the vesiculse, and of the existence of the characteristic spermatic animalcules in the fluid of the vesiculse, in every instance in which they were detected in the fluid of the vasa deferentia.* Hunter does not mention having used the microscope in his inquiry. If he had, he could hardly have failed to have arrived at a different conclusion. The second inference is supported by there being a certain difference in almost every case betw^een the fluid of the vesiculae and that of the vasa deferentia, and especially by the circumstance, that the difierence of quality is most perceptible in the fluid of the * I may add, that I have observed spermatic animalcules in the vesicul® of the ram and bull, precisely similar to those found in their testes and vasa deferentia; and if I recollect rightly, they have been detected in the vesicul® of some other animals by MM. Prevost and Dumas. Whether the vesicul® of certain animals, however, have not a specific use, distinct from that of being merely reservoirs, ap- pears to be deserving of further and special inquiry.

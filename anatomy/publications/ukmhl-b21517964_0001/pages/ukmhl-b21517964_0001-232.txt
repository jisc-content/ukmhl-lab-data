TEMPERATURE OF THE SHEEP 212 Left ventricle Right ventricle (blood in it) - Liver - 109° 106° 106° From ten to fifteen minutes elapsed between the examination of the brain and heart. The tempera- ture of the rectum was tried during life. The head was cut off immediately after the flow of blood had ceased. The heart was not taken out till the skin and abdominal viscera had been removed. In the first experiment, in which the difference of arterial and venous blood was tried, the trial was carefully made, and the result unobjectionable. The small bulb of the thermometer was introduced into the jugular vein, and the blood flowed freely over it; and, it was placed in the full stream of arterial blood, close to the wound in the carotid artery, after a ligature had been applied to the jugular. The following observations were made on the 29th of January, between one and two o’clock, p. m., when the air was about 46°. It rained the preceding night; froze early in the morning ; after eight, a. m. there was a continued thaw. 1.—Rectum - - - 105° Venous blood, from jugular vein - 104° Arterial from carotid artery - 106° Right ventricle of heart - - 105° Muscle of left ventricle, where thickest 108-5 Left ventricle - - 108° Brain at base - - - io.5°

ON THE TORPEDO. 87 the surface with their external apertures just as they appeared in the fresh fish, in which they were visible in an unusually clear manner, even for a young torpedo.* The clusters of glandules, as far as I have ob- served, are never less than four in number. These are pretty regular in their situation; the largest is to be found, on dissection, in the mesian line, be- tween the anterior extremities of the electrical organs, surrounded by a soft gelatinous substance. A smaller cluster occurs just anterior to each eye, similarly imbedded. These are supplied with nerves from the fifth pair. Two other clusters occur, one on each side of the electrical organs, between them and the pectoral fins, as represented in the Figure. I have occasionally found another pair of these clustered glandules, nearly in a transverse line with the preceding, between the margin of the electrical organs and the gills. These latter are supplied with nerves from the sixth pair. In addition to these principal clusters, there are very many much smaller clusters and solitary glandules scattered under the skin, in the cellular tissue, furnished with short excretory ducts: they are most distinct, in the upper margin of the body, between its extreme circum- ference and the border of the electrical organs. The excretory ducts which proceed from the * On account of a greater degree of transparency of the skin of the young fish, it is very much better adapted than an old or full ffrown one for the examination of the mucous system.

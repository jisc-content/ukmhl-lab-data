PNEUMATHORAX. 269 nued to increase until the 21st. The most promi- nent symptoms were, a feeling of extreme tightness about the chest and abdomen; rapid and difficult respiration, between 30 and 40 in a minute; great anxiety of countenance and agitation of mind, accompanied with a small pulse of 130, cold sweat on the face and neck, and much prostration of strength. On examining the chest, the left side was found more protuberant, and in all its dimen- sions larger than the right. It was tense, and on percussion sounded remarkably hollow and tym- panitic. The heart was felt beating on the right side, even under the mamilla. Satisfied that the distension, and the distressing symptoms accompanying it, resulted from air in the pleura,—reflecting on the suddenness of the attack, the tolerable health the patient was in previously, and the now imminent danger of life,—I proposed in consultation the operation of paracentesis,—which was approved of, and with the ready assent of the suffering patient, immediately performed. With a small trochar, attached to a flaccid bladder, I carefully perforated the left side of the chest, between the 8th and 9th rib, having pre- viously divided the integuments with a scalpel. On withdrawing the stilette, a little air rushed out and was collected in the bladder, but not in the quantity that I expected; it did not exceed 5 cubic inches. On examination it was found to consist of azote, and a little carbonic acid.

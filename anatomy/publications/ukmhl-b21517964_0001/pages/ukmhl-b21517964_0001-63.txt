43 ON THE TORPEDO. organs is probably somehow connected witli their opposite electrical states. I may here notice another peculiarity of or- ganization in the torpedo, which came under my observation in seeking, though unsuccessfully, for the great sympathetic or the analogous ganglionic nerves, which Cuvier asserts to exist in the cartila- ginous fishes.The peculiarity alluded to is re- presented in Plate I. fig. 3. It has very much the appearance of a nervous ganglion, but is in reality a blood-vessel, enlarged into a little bulb, lined with a reddish substance, like muscular fibre, giving the idea of a small heart. It is situated one on each side of the aorta, from whence it proceeds, just below the great nervous fasciculus which supplies the pectoral fin, and the arterial branch derived from it is lost in this fin. If it be muscular, as its appearance denotes, its functions may be to aid in propelling the blood into the pectoral fin, and per- haps into the electrical organ. 3.â€” Theoretical Remarks. The experiments which I have detailed on the electricity of the torpedo, confirm those of Mr. Walsh, made in 1772, shewing its resemblance to common electricity. They moreover show, that like common electricity, and voltaic electricity, it has the power of giving magnetic polarity to iron, and of producing certain chemical changes. In * Hist.

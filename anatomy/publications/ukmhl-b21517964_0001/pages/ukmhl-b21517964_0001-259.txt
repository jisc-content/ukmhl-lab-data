HUMAN BODY AFTER DEATH. 239 body in health, or in ordinary disease. If it were immediately concluded that this was an instance of the local generation of heat in the inflamed part,â€” it would be an assumption, and might be considered an error. And, have not observations of this kind been made and published, and adduced as argu- ments in reasoning on animal heat, as regards its theory? Relative to the majority of the examples In wdiich the temperature of the dead body was ascertained, I shall avoid making many reflections at present: I shall be well pleased if they induce others to con- tinue an inquiry which may lead to interesting re- sults, both as concerns physiology, and perhaps pathology. The temperature of a part, perhaps, may prove a safe criterion, cceteris paribus, of the quantity of blood which passes through it in a given time. According to this test, it may be inferred, that the supply of blood to the brain, in the ordinary esti- mates of it, is over-rated. May not the temperature of the deeply seated parts, after death, give some insight into the manner in which death has occurred, or help to elucidate its cause ? In example No. 9> the temperature of the heart and liver was low. Was this connected with the state and function of the lungs, during the latter period of life, when much organic disease ex- isted in them; when their functional action appeared to be feeble, and the quantity of heat generated small ?

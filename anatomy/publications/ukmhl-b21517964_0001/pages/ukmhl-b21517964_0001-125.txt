105 OF SOME OF THE AMPHIBIA. favourite and common diet of both. Other remark- able instances might be mentioned of similarity of diet and difference of urinary secretion; and vice versa^ instances might be afforded of difference of diet and similarity of urine: I will mention one only; it is that of parrots and snakes; their urine, as I have found, being much the same, consisting chiefly of lithic acid, though their diet is altogether different, the birds feeding entirely on vegetable matter,â€”the reptiles entirely on animal matter.* But let me not be supposed to maintain that the urinary secretion depends entirely on the organ, quite inde- pendent of the nature of the food, or of the blood, from which the elements of the urine are derived. It appears to be pretty satisfactorily proved, that, cceteris parihm, there is a certain relation between the nature of the food and of the urine. Whilst this has been generally admitted, the relation between the organ and the secretion has been less insisted on, though perhaps not less curious and deserving of attention. * The land tortoise of the shores of the Mediterranean is another remarkable instance. I have mentioned how I found its urine to consist chiefly of lithic acid; yet its food is chiefly, indeed I believe, exclusively vegetable matter.

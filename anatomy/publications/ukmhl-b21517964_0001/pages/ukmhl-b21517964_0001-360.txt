FLUID OF THE 340 pressly for the purpose of examining the spermatic Huid, with a microscope of Chevalier, by which the peculiar entozoa had been seen by certain French savans ;—how he procured an excellent instrument of the same kind, and employed it at home ; and how, aided by Mr. Bauer, after examining the sper- matic fluid of the fallow-deer, when in heat, during two seasons, under most favourable circumstances, he was unable to discover any animalcules in it, and was confirmed in his opinion of their non- existence. At present, this opinion of Sir Everard Home’s being unquestionably erroneous, it is not necessary either to criticise or controvert it. The reflection, however, which it gives rise to, (if I may judge from my own feeling) is of a painful kind; especially in relation to his other microscopical observations,—so beautifully represented by Mr. Bauer, and admirably engraved,—in the accuracy of which now it seems a matter almost of impossibility to have any confidence. And this, I think it right to point out particularly, considering the manner in which Sir Everard Home prefaced the most remarkable of the microscopical observations,—observations which, if correct, would, as he anticipated, have been of the greatest import- ance, and which could not fail producing a great change in our physiological doctrines. Take, as an example, his introductory remarks to his Croonian Lecture, for 1817, “On the Changes the Blood undergoes in the act of Coagulation,” in which he

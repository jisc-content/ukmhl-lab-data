251 PNEUMATHORAX. inches were collected in receivers, and about thirteen cubic inches escaped, making altogether the enor- mous volume of 225 cubic inches. The air collected was set aside for analysis, and the body having been replaced on the table, a portion of the ribs was removed from the right side to admit of the exami- nation of the chest, the water which had rushed in to supply the place of the air having been carefully taken out and preserved. The inner surface of the right pleura was covered with a thin layer of coagulable lymph. The right lung was exceedingly compressed ; it adhered closely to the upper part of the pericardium, and loosely to the posterior part of the chest (about the sixth and seventh ribs) by a few strong bands. On inflating the lungs with a double bellows through an opening into the trachea, the right lung became much expanded, and air was found to pass freely from the lung into the pleura through an ulcerated opening in the upper part of the superior lobe. The right lung was carefully dissected out. In the upper part of its superior lobe, a tubercular exca- vation or vomica was found, of the capacity of about four ounce-measures, communicating with the aspera arteria by a large bronchial tube, the ulcerated end of which terminated in the side of the excavation opposite to the openings by which the vomica com- municated with the pleura. On examining minutely the communication between the cavity of the chest and the lung, a kind of valvu-

165 AND OTHER ANIMALS. of the sudden change of temperature on the heat of man in descending from Kandy to Trincomalie. The town of Kandy, the capital of the interior of Ceylon, is situated in latitude N. 7° 17', and is elevated about 1,500 feet above the level of the sea.* Trincomalie is situated in latitude 8° 34'. Kandy is surrounded by hills and mountains, which are covered with w^ood, and frequently enveloped in clouds, and which abound in springs and torrents. Trincomalie is, at least, fifty miles distant from any mountains. The intervening country is low, and, though wooded, very dry, being subject to long-con- tinued drought. One of the consequences of these peculiarities of situation is, that the difference of temperature, between the two places, is very con- siderable. The mean annual temperature of Kandy is about 73*5, whilst that of Trincomalie is about 10 degrees higher; and in the summer and autumn months the difference of temperature is from 12 to 15 degrees. On the 15th of September, 1818, the day before I left Kandy for Trincomalie, at eight o’clock in the morning, when the air was 69°, I ascertained the temperature, both under the tongue, and in the axilla, of six persons who were to accompany me,— one a servant, the other five, part of a set of palan- keen bearers, all natives of the western coast of the island, all in good health, cool, and fasting. * This elevation I ascertained by means of the barometer. For the exact latitude of Kandy I was indebted to G. Lusignan, Esq.

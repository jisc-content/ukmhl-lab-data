286 EFFECTS OF THE SUN’s RAYS is the tan of the skin well impressed and established, and many months elapse before it disappears.* A.thly^ I have examined, with some attention, the cuticle of the Negro, of people of colour, and of Europeans who have become dark-brown from ex- posure to the sun’s rays within the tropics. In each instance, when detached, it has appeared much less coloured than the skin; and, when minutely in- spected, it has been found to owe its colour to colouring matter attached to it, detached from the cutis. Lastly, I have preferred assigning the surface of the cutis as the seat of the discoloration (supposing it to be proved that the cuticle is not), rather than the rete mucosum or corpus mucosum of authors, as the very existence of such a texture is proble- matical. From the experiments which I have made on moles, and the coloured areola of the mamilla of fair persons, and on the skin of the Negro, I am disposed to believe that the colour, in all these instances, is owing to a colouring matter deposited in minute particles or filaments, on the surface of the cutis, as a secretion analogous, in its chemical properties, to the pigmentum nigrum of the eye.f * The discoloration produced in August, by exposure of the skin for an hour and a half, at the expiration of seventeen months, was just visible. I may add, that I have found it to continue much longer on a part always covered, as the arm, than on the back of the hand, which has been covered only in the open air. t I find that the colouring matter of the skin of the Negro, and the pigmentum nigrum of the eye, are acted on'very similarly by

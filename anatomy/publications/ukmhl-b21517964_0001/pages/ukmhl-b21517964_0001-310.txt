21K) EFFECTS OF THE SUN’s RAYS discoloration, by exciting inflammation, the facts already mentioned are, it appears to me, sufficient proof. Indeed, whatever cause excites inflamma- tion or irritation of the skin, seems to have an analogous effect, and to discolour it. Erysipelas, erythema, most of the exanthemata, burns, ulcers, excoriations, all occasion this effect (and, I believe, cold even is not an exception*), in different degrees, and very much in proportion to the intensity of the preceding inflammation, but whether exactly in that ratio it is difficult to determine. And we witness something of the same kind in mucous membranes; at least, I have observed that the cicatrices of old ulcers of the intestines are always discoloured, and either grey, blue, or almost black, apparently ac- cording to the degree of severity of the local dis- ease which preceded them. I have just said it is difficult to determine if the effect of discoloration be exactly proportioned to the inflammatory effect. There are circumstances in favour of its not being so. The erythema pro- * Is not the dark colour of the inhabitants of the Arctic regions as much owing to the inflammatory or irritating eflect of the ex- treme cold of winter, as to the scorching influence of the continued sunshine of summer ? Milton’s highly poetical expression, the burning “frore” which he uses in his description of the damned regions, is in accordance with accurate observation of the agency of intense cold, in many respects so analogous to that of great heat: “ The parching air Burns frore, and cold performs the effect of fire,”

EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMAL HEAT. 141 VI. AN ACCOUNT OF SOME EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMAL HEAT.* In the present uncertain state of our knowledge of animal heat, theoretically considered, three cir- cumstances are particularly deserving of attention, viz. the relative capacities of venous and arterial blood for heat, their comparative temperatures, and the temperatures of different parts of the animal body. On the first of these subjects, we possess only the experiments of Dr. Crawford, which I believe have not yet been repeated, notwithstanding they form the basis of his hypothesis. On the second, little inquiry has been made, and especially of late years, since the improvement of the thermometer. And, on the third, the observations that have been collected are very few in number, and with the exception of those of Messrs. Hunter and Carlisle, are scarcely perhaps deserving of confidence. * This Paper first appeared in the Philosophical Transactions for 1814; most of the prefatory remarks are still applicable.

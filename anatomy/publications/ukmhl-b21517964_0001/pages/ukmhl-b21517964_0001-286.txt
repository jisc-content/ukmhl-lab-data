TWO CASES OF 266 ing: the air from the antrum maxillare in one in- stance consisted of 4*3 carbonic acid. 13*0 oxygen. 82*7 azote. From the frontal sinus, of 13*5 oxygen. 86*5 azote. without any carbonic acid gas, the absence of which may have been owing to there being a good deal of mucus in the cavity; the mucus might have ab- sorbed it. In another instance the air from the antrum maxillare consisted of 4*2 carbonic acid 13*8 oxygen 82*0 azote; From the frontal sinus, of 4*5 carbonic acid 9*5 oxygen 86*0 azote. On the supposition that the air, previous to its entering these cavities, had undergone a partial change from respiration, the results described seem to indicate an absorption of oxygen. Other facts might be adduced, which, like the preceding, though not conclusive, tend to support the idea, that mucous membranes are capable of absorbing air. Of this kind, 1 conceive, are the

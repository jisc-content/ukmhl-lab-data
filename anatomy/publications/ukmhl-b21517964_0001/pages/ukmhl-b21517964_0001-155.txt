135 V. ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE HEART OF BATRACHIAN ANIMALS, ESPECIALLY OF THE GENUS RANA OF LINN.EUS. From the urinary organs of reptiles, my attention, whilst I was in Ceylon, was directed to other parts of their structure, and especially to the apparatus of circulation and respiration. It was at that time commonly asserted by the highest authorities in comparative anatomy, and generally believed, that the animals belonging to the genus Rana, and indeed all those included in the natural order of Batrachians of Cuvier, in the conformation of their heart, differed from the other reptiles, which possess a bi-auricular heart; and re- sembled fishes,â€”which have only a single auricle as w'ell as ventricle. The close analogy in general structure which exists between the batrachians and the other reptiles, led me to doubt the accuracy of this conclusion; and observations which I had an opportunity of making first in Ceylon, and afterwards in 1821 and

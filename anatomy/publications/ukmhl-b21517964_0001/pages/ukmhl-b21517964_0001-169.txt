Coleman and Cooper, which are directly opposite, excepting on the supposition of its being connected with the mode in which the ani- mals they experimented upon were killed, viz.—by asphyxia. In death by asphyxia, there is generally an accumulation of blood in the right ventricle, and in many instances I have observed, when the right ven- tricle has been distended with blood, little difference of temperature between the two sides of the heart.* * In instances of death by asphyxia,—theoretically considered, it might be expected, that the blood returning from the lungs to the

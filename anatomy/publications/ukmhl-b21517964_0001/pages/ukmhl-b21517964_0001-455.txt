If this were so, fortunately, it may be considered a very rare occurrence, and as it were, the exception to the general rule. The common train of events, that which constitutes the rule, seems to be that which was witnessed in the first instance, and which has been so happily illustrated by the experiments of Sir Astley Cooper already referred to. The subject of the occlusion of arteries is one of great interest and of more frequent occurrence, I apprehend, than is commonly supposed. I have met with many examples of it, after death, which during life were never suspected, and even in large vessels, and in soldiers of active habits, who died of acute diseases, of short duration totally uncon- nected with the local peculiarity.

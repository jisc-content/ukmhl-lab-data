47 ON THE TORPEDO. the secretions of animals generally, it appears to be the result of living action; and connected with a peculiar and unusually complicated organization. All the attempts have been vain, which I have made, directed to obtain electrical excitement in the fish, after it had been deprived of life. The observations which I have detailed relating to its anatomical structure, show a complicated adap- tation of parts—nerves of unusual magnitude ramify- ing betw een apparently insensible columns, saturated with a bad conducting fluid; muscles surrounding these columns, and fitted to compress them; and a system of mucous glands and tubes adjoining, well adapted to be the medium of electrical communica- tion in the surfaces to which they belong. When we consider this structure, it is an easy matter to trace rude analogies between it and the pile of Volta, or between its columns, and a battery of Leyden jars, such a battery as was formed by Mr. Cavendish, for imitating the electricity of the tor- pedo, composed of a large number of jars of very thin glass feebly charged. But these analogies seem to help very little, if at all, towards the solution of the great difficulty; the question remains unanswered, what is the cause or source of the electricity ? Here analogy fails entirely; none of the ordinary modes of excitement appear to be at all concerned—neither friction, nor chemical action, or change of tempera- ture, or change of form. Let us consider for a moment a small torpedo in an active state. The

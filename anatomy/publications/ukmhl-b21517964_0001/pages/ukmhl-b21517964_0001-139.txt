In a few seconds, the bird had lost the use of its legs; it fell, and in two or three minutes expired, without apparent suffering or any remarkable symptom. The body was immediately examined. No visible lesion could be discovered in any of the organs. According to the best of my recollection, it was on this occasion, that both my friend and myself tasted the poison of the Naia, applying a very minute quantity which had been taken from the poison-bag, the same as was used in the preceding experiments, to the tip of the tongue.

In 1821, my friend was alive and actively engaged in scientific pursuits in India. Unfortunately for science, he was prematurely cut oflP, shortly after, on his homeward voyage, by pulmonary disease, con- tracted in Ava, where he accompanied, as naturalist and medical officer, the political mission under the direction of Mr. Craufurd, the able historian of the Eastern Archipelago. Mr. Finlay son’s Journal of the Expedition, published after his death, bears ample and equal proof of his zeal, talent for observation and reflection, and rich acquirements.

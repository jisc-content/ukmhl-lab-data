51 ON THE TORPEDO. which I propose to offer relative to their comparative powers and structure. All these fishes have certain points of resemblance. Independent of their electrical powers, they are pecu- liarly defenceless ; their skin is soft—a true mucous membrane, although external, totally destitute equally of scales and of spines. Each possesses a supple- mentary organ, with which their electrical function is connected; and in each the nerves supplying these organs are of extraordinary magnitude. The electrical organs of the respective fishes bear to each other in their structure a general, but not close, resemblance. The organs of the torpedo are distinctly columnar—the columns very numerous; those of the gymnotus consist of septa, or of flat partitions with cross divisions between them ; whilst those of the silurus are neither distinctly columnar, nor cellular, being formed as it were of a delicate net-work of tendonous fibres, retaining interposed a soft gelatinous matter, somewhat similar to that con- tained in the fibrous columnar or cellular structure of the organs of the former fishes. The nerves supplying the organs are peculiarly deserving of remark. It is a curious circumstance, that in each instance, their source is different. In the torpedo, we have seen that they are derived exclusively from the brain, from its posterior tubercle. In the gymnotus electricus, they do not appear to come at all from the brain, but entirely from the E 2

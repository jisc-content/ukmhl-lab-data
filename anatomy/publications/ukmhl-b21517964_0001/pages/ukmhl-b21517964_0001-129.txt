BY THE COMMON TOAD. 109 quantity in the viscid fluid lubricating the tongue, and also in the urine, and even in the blood. In my paper, presented to the Royal Society, I called this fluid a poison ; considering the properties described, perhaps it may with more propriety be called an acrid than a poisonous fluid; and rather analogous to that secreted by certain insects, as the bee, and scorpion, than to the more virulent and less acrid fluid of the poisonous snakes. Reflecting on the use which this fluid may be of to the toad, it occurred to me, that it may answer two purposes, and these of importance to this ab- horred but innocent reptile. As the external surface of the skin is smeared with this “ sweltered venom,” as it has been called by our great dramatic poet, it must serve to defend it from the attacks of carnivorous animals: “ a toad to eat,” is a proverbial expression well known; and the facts adduced show its propriety and force.

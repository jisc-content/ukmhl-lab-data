VESICUL.E SEMINALES OF MAN. 325 entia; one was examined three hours after death. The testes were of natural size, and not apparently diseased. The vesiculae contained very little fluid. It was thick, gelatinous, nearly transparent and co- lourless, and did not change the colour of turmeric or litmus paper. Under the microscope some glo- bules were seen in it, but no animalcules. 14.â€”Aged 27 ; died of pulmonary consumption. The dissection was made thirty-two hours after death. The body was much emaciated. The lungs were enormously diseased; besides a large excavation in each superior lobe, and several smaller ones, and a vast quantity of tubercles in progressive change, there was partial oedema and hepatization, and thick- ening of the bronchia. One arytenoid cartilage was laid bare by ulceration; the left nervus vagus was partially atrophied under the pressure of an enlarged bronchial gland. There were numerous large granu- lating ulcers in the caecum and ascending colon; the vermiform appendix was severely ulcerated, and the lower part of the ileum in a less degree.

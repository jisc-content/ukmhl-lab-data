TWO CASES OF 25G About 30 cubic inches of air, consisting of 80 parts common air, and 20 carbonic acid gas, were passed from a receiver into a bladder, furnished at one extremity with a stop-cock, and at the other with a small trochar; both air-tight. A small in- cision having been made through the integuments of the right side of the chest of a dog, the trochar was passed through the intercostal muscles into the pleura. The stilette was immediately drawn from the cannula into the bladder, and the air of the bladder instantly rushed into the pleura, and, on expiration, was in part forced back into the bladder. The exact quantity of air retained was not deter- mined ; it must have exceeded at least ten cubic inches. As speedily as possible the cannula was withdrawn, and the external wound carefully closed by suture. The health of the dog was very little impaired by the operation. Two hours after, when the animal appeared to be quite well, a similar ex- periment was made on the left side of the chest, and a mixture, consisting of 75 parts common air, and 25 carbonic acid gas, was introduced into the pleura. The operation had very little more effect than the former. At the end of twenty-four hours, the dog was killed, and immediately examined. About 3 cubic inches of air only were procured from the left pleura, which were found to consist of 18-3 carbonic acid gas. 78*3 azotic gas. 3-4 oxygen gas.

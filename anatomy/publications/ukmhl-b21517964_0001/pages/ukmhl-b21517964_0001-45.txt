25 ON THE TORPEDO. and this I have witnessed as distinctly in the foetal fish as in the adult; clearly showing that the effort is instinctive. The conductor, which I suppose to be necessary for conveying the electricity, when a shock is felt without immediate contact, exists in salt water. The galvanometer has been affected when the two extremities of it have been brought in contact, one with the back of the fish, and the other with the water, two or three inches from the fish. And, in one instance I experienced a shock, although I touched the water alone, close to a torpedo; it was in removing an active fish, by means of an earthenware dish, from one vessel into another; the hand that received the shock grasped the wet margin of the dish just as the torpedo entered it. I believe that the torpedo has the power of discharging its electricity in any direction it chooses. This inference is drawn from finding that when one hand, in contact with the opposite surfaces of the fish, is receiving shocks, the other hand immersed in the water close by, has received no shock. And, in confirmation of this, I may mention (and at the same time to show how the discharge is connected with the volition of the animal,) that when I have applied to the opposite surfaces of a torpedo copper plates, merely gently touching, joined together by a copper wire, and then irritated the fish with the contact wires in the usual manner, the galvanometer attached to the contact wires has been distinctly affected.

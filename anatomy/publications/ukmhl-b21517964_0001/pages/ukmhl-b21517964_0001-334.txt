FLUID IN THE 314 admitted with pneumonia, and died on the third day. On dissection, thirty-nine hours after death, the inferior lobe of the right lung was found hepa- tized, weighing nearly three pounds, the superior and middle only half a pound. There was a tuber- cular excavation and numerous tubercles in the left lung, — and small cavities and a pretty distinct cicatrix of a vomica in the upper part of the superior lobe of the right lung. The body was not ema- ciated. The vasa deferentia and vesiculae seminales were removed six hours after death. About a drop of fluid was obtained from each vas deferens, which accorded in appearance with the received description of the spermatic fluid. Examined with a microscope, constructed by that excellent maker Mr. Ross, and using an object-glass of one-eighth inch focal dis- tance, it was found to contain numerous animalcules, some of them in active motion. The vesiculae con- tained a considerable quantity of fluid. Some of it was collected after six hours; another portion later, after forty-two hours. The former did not appear to me to differ from the fluid of the vasa deferentia. It abounded in spermatic animalcules, some of which were alive and active: on standing a few hours it separated into two parts, one opaque that had sub- sided, the other transparent; and this was copiously precipitated by alcohol, and rendered of a con- sistence almost gelatinous. The last collected had ’

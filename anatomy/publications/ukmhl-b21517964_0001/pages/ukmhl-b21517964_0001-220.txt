EFFECT OF VIOLENT EXERCISE 200 At the end of the second day’s journey, at four o’clock in the afternoon, immediately on halting, I tried the temperature of three of the bearers. No. Therm, under Tongue. Axilla. 1 98° 98° 3 100° 98-5 4 98-5 98° Before setting out, when at rest, the skin of these men was cool, it conveyed, indeed, to the touch of another, the sensation almost of coldness; now, in- instantly after rather severe exercise, when the tem- perature under the tongue was not raised, that of the axilla was increased and the surface of the body generally felt hot. The next trial of temperature, under the influence of exercise, was made on the 26th July, on two of the same set of bearers, both about thirty years of age, both in good health, one stout and robust, the other rather slender. At ten a.m., at Ranne, in the Megam-pattoo, when the temperature of the air was 87°, after resting two hours, the temperature of the first man was, under the tongue, 99"? in the axilla 97°; and that of the second, under the tongue, was 98®, and in the axilla 97®. A few minutes after ten o’clock, I set out for Tangalle. The sun was bright, the weather unusually hot, and the men, as if impatient, proceeded with more than ordinary diligence and speed. At noon,

81 ON THE TORPEDO. muriatic acid, there was a slight disengagement of gas, and after a time the opaque matter was removed, and the acid, tested by ammonia, &c., was found to contain in solution, lime and phosphate of lime. Different parts of the skeleton vary in firmness, and degree of hardness, and also of elasticity, accord- ing, I believe, to the proportions of the principal con- stituent parts, the cartilage, water, and earthy matter. In those bones which are most flexible, soft, and trans- parent, as the fin-rays, there is very little earthy mat- ter, and the cartilage contains a large proportion of water. In those, on the contrary, which are most dense, as parts of the head, especially that part cor- responding to the os petrosum in mammalia, and the vertebrae, the quantity of earthy matter is compara- tively large, and the cartilage is of a compactor kind, in which there is a smaller proportion of water. The flexibility of the majority of animal textures is intimately connected with the presence of water. The skeleton of the torpedo, and of other fishes of the same order, offer a striking illustration of the fact: when the water is expelled by exposure for a sufficient time to a temperature of 212Â°, the most flexible parts become quite brittle : and by absorp- tion of w^ater, they again become flexible. I have mentioned that cartilage may be considered as the basis of the skeleton; independent of other considerations, especially connected with fmtal de- velopment and growth, this may be inferred from the circumstance that, though the forms of the different VOL.

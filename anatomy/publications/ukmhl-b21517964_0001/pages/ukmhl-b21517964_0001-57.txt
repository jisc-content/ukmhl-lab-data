ON THE TORPEDO. 37 stomach. The caudal branch (nervus lateralis) de- scends in a straight line under the peritoneal lining of the abdomen, and under the spinal nerves, with- out giving off a single branch, till it reaches the tail, in the muscular substance of which it is lost. I have not yet been able to discover any con- nexions of the electrical nerves besides those pointed out. It is an interesting fact that the gastric nerves are derived from them. Perhaps superfluous elec- tricity, when not required for the defence of the animal, may be directed to this organ to promote digestion. In the instance of a fish which I had in my possession alive many days, and which was fre- quently excited to give shocks, digestion appeared to have been completely arrested; when it died, a small fish was found in its stomach, much in the same state as when it was swallowed: no portion of it had been dissolved. Though I have not found the temperature of the electrical organs higher than that of other parts of the fish, or the temperature of the fish generally dif- ferent from that of the water in which it has been confined, yet it seems probable that as the branchiae are liberally supplied with twigs of the electrical nerves, there may be some connexion between its respiratory and electrical function ; and I venture to offer the conjecture that, by means of its electricity, it may have the power of decomposing water, and of supplying itself with air when lying covered with mud or sand in situations in which it is easy to con- ,

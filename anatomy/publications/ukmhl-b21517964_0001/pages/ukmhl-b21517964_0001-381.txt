361 ACID TO ANATOMICAL PURPOSES. boundaries of which are white opaque lines. On the ligamentous sheath of the penis its expansive power is less forcibly exerted ; the sheath is rendered nearly transparent; and its structure is beautifully shewn, as if composed of a white pulp as a ground- work, intersected and bound together by very fine opalescent fibres. On the aponeurotic sheaths of muscles, its effects are very similar. On the chordae tendineae of the heart its effect is inconsiderable; it expands them but little, and renders them semi-trans- parent. On one part of the intervertebral substance it acts in the same manner as on tendon, of which part the inner portion, that nearest the cavity of the abdomen, chiefly consists, at least in the lumbar region; but, on the other part, its action is hardly perceptible. In consequence of this difference of action of the acid on the component parts of the in- tervertebral substance, it is well adapted to display its peculiar compound structure. When the acid is strong, an imperfect solution of a part of the tendon or ligament takes place, which subsides in the form of a semi-transparent very fine jelly. Cartilage is not changed by the acid; neither the dense cartilages of the ribs, nor the delicate ones at- tached to certain organs, as the tarsus, epiglottis, &c. It is equally inactive on bone. Nor does it appear to have any sensible effect either on mus- cular fibre, or on the substance of the brain and spinal chord, or of the nerves and ganglia. On mucous membranes its action is considerable:

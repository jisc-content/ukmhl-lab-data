()5 ON THE TORPEDO. The mean of the results contained in these tables is, that the weight of the egg, before any appearance of the embryo, is 182 grains; and after its appear- ance, including the weight of the embryo, about 177 grains;â€”whilst the weight of the mature foetal fish is about 479 grains, proving an augmentation of weight in the mature foetus more than double that of the egg; and in this respect differing remarkably from the foetal chick, which at its full time weighs considerably less than the original yolk and white from which it is formed, owing in part to the evapo- ration of water through the shell, and in part to the excretions going on, especially of lithic acid derived from the kidnevs. How is this aimmentation of weight to be accounted for? Is there, as in the majority of the mammalia, any connexion between the foetus of the torpedo and the parent, through the medium of a vascular or cellular structure ? or, has the foetal fish in utero the power of feeding by the mouth, and of taking food into the stomach? or, does the uterine cavity of the parent fish secrete or pour out a fluid, which is absorbed by and in part nourishes the foetus ? The first and second query I must answer in the negative; nothing that I have observed indicates any connexion such as that supposed in the first query, between the parent and foetus. I have carefully examined the gravid uterus under water, thinking it possible that the villi of the uterine cavity might inosculate with the branchial filaments; but I could VOL. I. F

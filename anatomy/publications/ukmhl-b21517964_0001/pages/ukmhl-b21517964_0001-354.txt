FLUID IN THE 334 fundus,—where most out of the way of being readily mixed with the fluid of the testes. What the exact difference of qualities is between the fluid of the vesiculse and of the vasa deferentia, and, it may be added, of the vasa beferentia and of the testes, in perfect health, remains to be ascertained. It can be determined only by careful examination and com- parison in the instances of criminals who have been executed, or of persons who have been killed by accident, not labouring under chronic disease, and in the vigour of life. I am disposed to think that the difference will not be found very considerable, and that between the fluid of the vesiculae and of the vasa deferentia, it will consist chiefly in the former being more dilute and perhaps more bland and mu- cous.* Hunter was of opinion that the fluid of the vesiculae is naturally of a brownish hue. As an invariable quality this appears questionable. The sooner after death the fluid is examined, the less brown it is. I have given amongst the preceding cases, instances in which it was colourless, and those examples in which there was reason to consider it least altered in consequence of disease : and Mr. flunter’s best observations are in accordance, viz. two instances, the only ones given in w'hich exami- nation was made very soon after death. He says, in a man killed by a cannon-ball, “ the fluid in the * That the vesiculaj are glandular, or possess mucous follicles, seems unquestionable ; I have seen them with the microscope, and the mucous secretion is made manifest in disease.

ACID TO ANATOMICAL PURPOSES. 375 On tlie economical uses of this acid, and they are many, as in relation to its power of preventing the fermentation to which all the saccharine preparations of the kitchen are so subject,—of preventing the changing of wines into vinegar, to which all the lighter and more delicate ones are liable,—and, fur- ther, of preventing the common vegetable acids, as vinegar and lime juice, &c., and vegetable prepara- tions in general, from spoiling, it would be unsuit- able in this place to dwell. I shall merely remark, that the efficacy of the acid in all these respects is great and extraordinary, as must be known in part to many, and which may be learned by the easiest trials.* This subject, the economical uses of the sulphurous acid, is an important one to society, and would well reward the labours of the inquirer who would undertake the minute investigation of it. flammation, by immersion in the acid, either coagulable lymph will be detected effused on the surface, or under it, or serum in the adjoin- ing cellular tissue, or some slight ulceration of the part affected. * It is not improbable, but that it may be useful for the preserva- tion of meat, especially in a hot climate. I recollect, when sanguine of its efficacy, at the time I was engaged in experiments on it, keep- ing a chicken a week in the acid gas in the hottest time of the sum- mer of the Ionian Islands, and having it approved of at table.

48 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS smallest which I have employed in my experiments weighed only 410 grains, and contained only 48 grains of solid matter; its electrical organs weighed only 150 grains, and contained only 14 grains of solid matter,—for to this they were reduced by thorough drying. Yet this small mass of matter gave sharp shocks, converted needles into magnets, affected distinctly the multiplier, and acted as a chemical agent, effecting the decomposition of water, &c. A i^riori^ how inconceivable that these effects could be so produced ! This fish was about ten days in my possession, during the whole of which time it ate nothing, and its bulk was hardly sensibly altered ; and every day it exercised its electrical powers, and to the last they appeared almost as energetic as when it was fresh from the sea. This adds, if pos- sible, to the difficulty of explanation. That this mysterious function is intimately connected with the nerves, and in a manner more striking than all ordinary secretions, is manifest. Beyond this con- clusion, all is darkness. We have not, as we have in the doctrine of animal heat, advanced another step—we have not been able to connect it with changes in the electrical organs, as analogous to known sources of electricity, as the changes which take place in the lungs in respiration are to the known sources of heat or combustion. The attain- ment of this step is a great desideratum, and beyond it, probably, we shall never be able to proceed. Without reverting to the conjectures, which in pas-

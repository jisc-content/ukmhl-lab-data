This appearance, on examination, proved to be fallacious, for the air was found to be not in the left pleura, but in a cavity of the mediastinum com- municating with the right pleura, and containing a lobule of the right lung, dextri pulmonis additamen- tum^ as Haller calls it, who has noticed this structure in the mediastinum of the dog and many other animals, and pointed it out as one of the principal causes of the erroneous notion which he combated.* Was the azote derived from the blood as an exha- lation or secretion ? Facts might be advanced in favour of this idea. An exhalation or disengagement of azote appears to have taken place in the experiments of Messrs. Allen and Pepys, when oxygen, nearly pure, was respired.f In the inspection of dead bodies, air has frequently been found in the vessels and closed cavities; which is probably azote.J * Haller’s Opuscula Anat. p. 44. t Philos.

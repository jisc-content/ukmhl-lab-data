PNEUMATHORAX. 257 whilst the air admitted consisted of 20*0 carbonic acid gas 63*2 azotic gas 16*8 oxygen gas. Thus apparently shewing, that during a sojourn of three days in the pleura, the oxygen had been absorbed in a greater degree than the carbonic acid gas; and the latter, in a greater degree than the azote. The result of the experiment on the left pleura was very similar; it afforded 10 cubic inches of gas, consisting of 25 carbonic acid, 70*6 azote, and 4’4 oxygen. The appearances on examining the wounds, were satisfactory: the cavity of the chest was free from inflammation, the lungs unin- jured, and the cicatrix in the pleura only just per- ceptible. The results of these experiments seem to warrant the conclusion, that in the preceding case, the car- bonic acid gas found, was not derived from the surface of the pleura by secretion, or exhalation, but from the respired air, through the ulcerated opening. And, with this remark, I shall dismiss the case of pneuma- thorax,—the consideration of which, as a medical subject, would not be appropriate in this place. The power exhibited by the pleura, in the preced- ing instances, of absorbing gases, and the manner in which it exercised that power, in a greater degree, on one air than on another, and that in no ratio to their solubility in water, appeared to me so interest- VOL.

ON THE SKIN. 297 ceptibility to a renewal of the action is not long suspended, unless the cause is in constant activity. How long it is suspended it is difficult to determine: it is suspended in different degrees, probably in persons of different complexions and temperaments, least in the fair,* more in the brown European races, and most of all in the deeply coloured Asiatic and African tribes. Besides the foregoing, there are other means which nature employs to counteract the influence of the sun’s rays on the human body, and to keep down animal heat within the bounds of health, in situations where otherwise it would be most apt to be in excess, and mount to a feverish height. These means seem to be of two kinds, one external, the other internal. Perspiration, both sensible and insensible, consti- tutes one of the first. It not only cools the surface in connexion with evaporation, but also, when in the form of sweat, by dispersing the sun’s rays, prevents or diminishes their scorching agency, as is easily shewn by comparing the effect of the sun’s ray’s, concentrated by a lens on a dry and a wet skin. The internal means are not so obvious ; but that they * Very fair persons, as regards complexion, are least affected by climate, and exposure to the bright light of a tropical skyj—in this respect resembling the Albino. Unusual exposure to the sun’s rays, is painfully felt by them; they experience sun-burn; but, after the erythema or superficial inflammation has subsided, and desquamation has taken place, the fairness of the skin is but little impaired,—and its liability but little diminished to suffer in the same manner from farther exposure.

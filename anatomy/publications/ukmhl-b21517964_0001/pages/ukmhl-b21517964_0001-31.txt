11 ON THE TORPEDO. I thought it possible, that by insulating the torpedo on a plate of dry glass, and wiping its circumference dry, and smearing it with oil, that the galvanometer might be affected. But in this, too, I have been disappointed; not even in flame, when the inter- ruption of the circle has been only just visible, has any effect on the instrument been produced.* Mr. Farady, in the Third Series of his Experi- mental Researches on Electricity, states that he has little or no doubt, were Harris’s electrometer applied to the torpedo, the evolution of heat would be observed.f I have made very many experiments on this subject, completely establishing Mr. Farady’s anticipation. The instrument employed was similar to that described by Mr. Harris in the Philosophical Transactions for 1827, differing merely in the wire passed through the small globe being exceedingly * Since the above remarks were first made, M. Matteucci has ob- tained sparks from the torpedo, and Mr. Farady from the Gymnotus, —not indeed directly, as Mr. Walsh was supposed to have done, but by means of a “ magneto-electric coil,” the object of which, it has been hypothetically said, is to prevent the electrical principles from neutralizing themselves directly through the conducting matter ad- joining ; and to force them to re-unite at a distance, by traversing the thin stratum of air in which the spark was taken. Biblioth^que Universelle de Genfeve, June, 1836, p. 387. The preceding part of this note was written in December;—I have since learned (now January 26, 1839,) that a spark has been taken direct from the Gym- notus, in the Adelaide Gallery, and that it was accidentally observed in making an experiment, instituted with a different object in view. My authority for this singular occurrence, and one so difficult of explanation, is the very intelligent superintendent, Mr. Bradley. • t Philosophical Transactions, 1833, p. 46.

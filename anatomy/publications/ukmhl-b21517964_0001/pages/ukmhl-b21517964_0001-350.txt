330 FLUID IN THE also abounded in them; they were all dead. This fluid had a brownish tint, and reddened litmus.* 19.—Aged 30; died of pulmonary consumption. The dissection was made twenty hours after death. The body was much emaciated. In both lungs granular tubercles abounded, and there was a large cavity in the superior lobe of each. The liver, spleen, kidneys, and supra-renal glands were un- usually firm. The liver weighed seven pounds, and contained some fatty matter. The spleen was about twice its natural size, and a portion of it dried on paper left a faint grease-stain. The ileum, caecum, appendicula vermiformis, colon, and rectum were partially ulcerated; and some of the ulcers in the large intestines had penetrated through all the coats, excepting the peritonaeal, and, indeed, this coat was penetrated through in the appendicula, where it happened to adhere in the right iliac fossa. There had been no dropsical symptoms; no peritonaeal inflammation ; diarrhoea had been troublesome in the last stage of the disease. The vasa deferentia and vesiculae were examined twenty-two hours after death. One vesicula con- tained pretty much fluid, the other very little. The fluid was of a just perceptible brownish hue, and of * In this case, the prostate contained a good deal of fluid, cor- responding to Meckel’s description of it in its healthy state. It was of a fawn colour, opaque, slightly viscid; under the microscope it was found to abound in pear-shaped particles, nearly equal in mag- nitude to blood-corpuscles.

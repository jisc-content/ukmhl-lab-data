ACCOUNT OF EXPERIMENTS 144 the relative capacities of venous and arterial blood, without fibrin, appear to be as 921 and 934. In the following experiments, the same kind of blood, and the same quantity, was used as in the preceding. The mixtures were made in a very thin glass receiver, containing a delicate thermometer. The temperature of the room was 66". Hot water, temperature 121“, cold water 61°. Mix- ture of the two 90°, after two minutes 89°, after three 88°, after eight 87". Venous blood 121°, water 62’5, mixture 89", after three minutes 88'5, and after seven 87". Now, allowing about one degree of the cooling effect to have been produced by the receiver, indi- cated by the admixture of the hot and cold water, calculating the quantity of blood used from the know- ledge of its volume and specific gravity, employing the formula given by Professor Robinson, which consists in multiplying respectively the weight of the water and the blood by the change of temperature, and dividing the first product by the second, the quotient or specific caloric for venous blood appears to be as 812, and for arterial, as 814, results very similar to those I have obtained with the blood of the sheep. In the remaining experiments, blood with the fibrin present was employed, and with this excep- tion they were perfectly similar to those already described. The blood, used to ascertain its time of cooling,

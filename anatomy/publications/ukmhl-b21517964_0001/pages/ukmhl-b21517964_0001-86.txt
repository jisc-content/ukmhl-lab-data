()() EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS not detect the slightest union of them or even ap- position. I have carefully examined too the stomach of the foetus in its different stages, and I have always found it empty. Admitting then that the augmenta- tion is effected by absorption (the only way appa- rently remaining to account for it) another question arisesâ€”How is the absorption accomplished ? Is the whole surface of the foetus an absorbing surface, as in the instance of some of the mammalia which are destitute of a placenta, and whose foetus does not appear to be connected with the uterus, as that of the opossum and kangaroo ? or are the branchial filaments the principal absorbing organs ? It appears not improbable that both the general surface and the filaments are concerned in the ope- ration. The late Dr. Monro, who observed these filaments in the foetus of the common skate, sup- posed that they perform the same function as the gills, and are a substitute for them, like the branchial appendices of the tadpole; and the same view has been taken by others, of analogous filaments belong- ing to the foetus of most of the squali. This func- tion they may perform in common with the surface, and at the same time they may convey nourishment and material for growth. If I may hazard a conjec- ture, I would suggest that the matter which may be absorbed by the surface may enter into the compo- sition of the body generally ; whilst that which may be absorbed by the branchial filaments may be chiefly employed in forming the electrical organs, and per-

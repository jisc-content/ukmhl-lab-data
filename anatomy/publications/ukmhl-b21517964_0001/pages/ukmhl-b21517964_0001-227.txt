TEMPERATURE OF THE INSANE. 207 was found to be 104'5, and his pulse rapid. This called attention to his state; and, although he made no complaint,—his appetite good,—the functions, as far as was known, tolerably well performed, it was inferred he had obscure disease of lungs. He died in less than a month, namely, on the 26th of August. The fatal disease was pulmonary consumption, or- ganically considered, in an aggravated form; but in relation to symptoms, most mild. There were ulcers of larynx without affection of voice;—most extensive disease of lungs, vomicse and tubercles without cough; ulceration of intestines without diarrhoea; and disease of testes, vesiculm seminales, and prostrate, of a severe kind, equally latent, excepting in the testicle, the hardness and enlargement of which, but without pain, were casually noticed.

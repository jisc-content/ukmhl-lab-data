75 ON THE TORPEDO. is of considerable difficulty, requiring much time and patient waiting, owing to the great rareness of the gravid fish. Some idea of this may be formed, when I mention, that after I had begun the pur- suit, more than twelve months elapsed, before I could procure a fish with young, though I examined a very large number in hope of finding one, and though I offered to pay the fishermen above fifteen times the market price of the fish. 6.— On the Species of Torpedo in the Medi- terranean. Respecting the number of species of torpedo found in the Mediterranean, naturalists have been much divided in opinion; some, as Rondelet, fol- lowed by Risso, admitting five species; some as Bellon, and latterly Rudolphi, limiting them to two ; and others, as Linneus and Bloch, with Willoughby, Ray, and Artedi, admitting only one.* That there are two distinct species in the Medi- terranean, namely, the occhiatella, and the tremola, as the two kinds are vulgarly called at Rome, the * Both those who have adopted four species and those who have allowed only one, appear to have followed Rondelet—in the latter instance critically, in the fonner literally; in proof of which the following passage may be adduced. “ Torpedinum genera quatuor faciinus tria earum quae maculis notatae sunt, quartum quae maculis caret. Quae genera omnia viribus et corporis specie non dilferunt, sed maculis tantum. Quare quae de unius facultatibus et partium turn internarum, turn externarum descriptione dicuntur, eadem etiam reli- quis convenire existimatio.”—G. Rondeletii, Libri de Piscibus, &c. p. 362. fol.

31 ON THE TORPEDO, (lid not change the colour of turmeric or bitmus paper; a cloudiness was occasioned by dropping into it a solution of nitrate of silver, which was not completely redissolved by aqua ammonice; it was copiously precipitated by acetate of lead, and a cloudiness was occasioned in it by nitrate of barytes, and by corrosive sublimate. By evapora- tion it afforded a residue which deliquesced par- tially on exposure to a moist atmosphere, and had an acrid and bitter saline taste. The exact proportion of this weak solution of animal and saline matters I have not ascertained, and indeed it would be very difficult to determine with any accuracy, for only a small portion separates spon- taneously ; and if pressure is used, the fibres are broken, and the fluid expressed is mixed with a pulpy matter.* When the electrical organs of the torpedo are immersed in boiling water, they suddenly contract in all their dimensions, and the columns from pen- tagonal, which they generally are, become circular. In my early experiments at Rome, they were rendered firmer by immersion for a few minutes, and the columns appeared to be tolerably distinctly fibrous and laminated, bringing to recollection the structure of the pile of Zamboni. Latterly I have not witnessed this effect; in a few seconds the * The torpedo is used for food, in the Mediterranean, amongst the lower classes; but the electrical organs are rejected,â€”they are con- sidered unwholesome.

130 EFFECTS OF THE POISON OF Conclusions and general Remarks. From the experiments on the poison of the hooded snake, it would appear that its bite is not necessarily fatal to fowls ; that the effect of the bite varies a good deal according to circumstances which it is not easy to calculate ; that the poison is capable of being soon exhausted ; that the symptoms produced by the poison, though not uniformly the same, pretty gene- rally correspond; and that, in conjunction with the appearances on dissection, they seem to indicate that the lungs are the j^i'incipal seat of the diseased action. From the experiments on the bite of the carawilla, it would appear that it is rarely fatal to small ani- mals ; that its poison is not easily exhausted ; that the symptoms produced by it are pretty uniform; that they are different from those produced by the poison of the hooded snake, the diseased action being more local and much more inflammatoryâ€”com- mencing in the part bitten, spreading progressively, losing its force as it extends, and probably never proving fatal, except it reach a vital organ. From the experiments with the tic-polonga, it appears that its bite greatly exceeds in fatality that of the hooded snake, or of the carawilla, and that the action of its poison is different and peculiar. Judging from the symptoms and appearances on dissection, its poison seems to exert its influence primarily and principally on the blood and muscular

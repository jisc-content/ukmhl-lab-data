EXPERIMENTS ON THE RUPTURE OF VESSELS. 441 obtained by experiment,â€”I instituted at the time some trials directed to test the strength of the parts concerned, which I shall now detail, with a few ad- ditional ones since made. Experiment 1. Tied the descending vena cava of a sheep re- cently killed, and through an opening in the ascend- ing vena cava, introduced the tube of a powerful injecting syringe, and secured it firmly by ligature. Forced water into the right side of the heart; a large quantity was introduced; the vein, auricle, ventricle and pulmonary artery became very much distended, as did also the lungs, and a watery exu- dation took place from their surface, without any sensible breach of continuity of surface. Conti- nuing the forcible injection of water, the right side was at length ruptured; the rupture took place in the sinus venosus close to the auricle, and was large enough to admit the finger. Experiment 2. Made a similar trial on the left side of the heart of the same animal, by injecting water through one of the pulmonary veins, close to its termination, having previously secured by ligature the aorta, below the arteria innominata. The auricle became greatly distended, the ventricle in a less degree, and the aorta still less. Rupture took place in this in- stance much more readily than in the former; the

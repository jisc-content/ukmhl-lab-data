40 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS cerned in some way, seems to be indicated not only by the situation of these glands between and sur- rounding the electrical organs, but still more so by the manner in which they are supplied with nerves, either from the first electrical, or from the fourth pair, which is connected with that nerve. As the thick semi-transparent mucus which the glands secrete is probably a better conductor of electricity than the skin alone or than salt water, this mucous system may serve as a medium of communication, not for the opposite surfaces of the electrical organs, but for each surface individually, included within the line of the system referred to.* I shall mention some results which are favourable to this idea. When one contact-wire was placed underneath an active torpedo, just anterior to the mouth, and the other at the extremitv of the back, out of the circle of the mucous apparatus, the shock of the fish had no effect either on the multiplier, or on needles in the spiral. But when the upper contact-wire was made to touch the back of one electrical organ, the under wire being placed as in the preceding experi- ment, then both effects were simultaneously produced; and they were also produced when the two wires w'ere * Some comparative experiments, which I have made, seem to indicate that the mucus of the torpedo is a better conductor than sea-water; when the hands were smeared with this mucus, or Avhen a portion of the fresh skin of a torpedo, with its natural mucus adhering to it, was wrapped round the ends of the contact Avires, hy Avhich they were held, the shock received appeared to be stronger than usual.

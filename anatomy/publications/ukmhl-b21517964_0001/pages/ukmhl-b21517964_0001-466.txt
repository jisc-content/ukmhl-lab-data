446 EXPEllIMENTS ON THE RUPTURE OF THE just before their termination, and the syringe being applied to the same vein as in the former instance, the subject being the same, and the other circum- stances the same, water was injected, until a rupture occurred. It took place opposite the fossa ovalis, in the thickest part of the sinus, close to the auri- cular-ventricular passage; the rent was sufficiently large to admit two fingers. Much force was re- quired to effect it, and it was preceded by much dilatation. Experiment LO. From the pulmonary vein, the pipe of the syringe was removed to the descending aorta, just where it begins to descend, and was secured by ligature. On injecting water, the vessel gradually became much dilated ; at first the semilunar valves appeared to perform their functions well; but as the dilatation increased, water began to flow out through the rup- tured auricle, augmenting with the distension, till it flowed freely. Experiment 11. Twenty-nine hours after death, from pulmonary consumption with numerous cavities in the lungs, and one of vast size, in the instance of a soldier aged 29; introduced the pipe of the syringe into the right internal jugular vein, not having tied any ves- sel, excepting the opposite veins in the neck,â€”the cavity of the abdomen having been carefully laid

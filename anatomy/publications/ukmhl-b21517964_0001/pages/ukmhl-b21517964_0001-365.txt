AQUA BINELLI, AND ITS SUPPOSED EFFECTS. 345 My attention was called to this water first by the late Captain the Honourable Sir Robert Spencer, in the summer of 1830, after a visit which he had made to Naples, at a time when the extraordinary virtues attributed to it were, in that city, a common topic of conversation, and when the proprietors of the secret of its preparation were selling it in large quantities. The specimen which I examined shortly after was part of a case of several bottles which he had order- ed to be forwarded to him at Malta,* for the pur- pose of having its qualities fairly investigated. It arrived after the decease of this enlightened officer, and was put into my hands for trial in our military hospitals, by the then governor, the late Major- General the Honourable Sir Frederick Ponsonby. I first examined into its physical and chemical qualities. It proved to be of the same specific gravity nearly as distilled water. It was neither acid, alkaline, or saline. Its odour was not unlike that of coal gas not purified, which it lost by boiling; the taste was rather pungent; not in the slightest degree astringent. In brief, it appeared to be merely water containing a little volatile oil or naphtha, and meditazione ed esperimento di chimica et di bottanica. L’ efficacia della medesima ad arrestare ogni piu minacciosa efiusione di sangue, fu mai sempre si costante e di tal giovamento alia medica arte, che non potrebbe ottenersi pin universale, e piu meritata lode di quella che all’ inventore di essa venne, da gran tempo, retributa.” * The charge for this case was about 8/. The price of the water at Naples, is four carlini, an ounce, or 2«. 8rf.

ON THE TORPEDO. 35 a slow deposition of the animal matter contained in the columns. Next to the nature of the substance of the elec- trical organs, the electrical nerves have occupied my attention. Their three great trunks have been accu- rately described by Mr. Hunter; but this distin- guished anatomist has very briefly noticed their dis- tribution, which is curious, and deserving, I believe, of minuter investigation. I shall attempt little more than an outline of what I have observed in some dissections conducted with considerable care. In examining the brain (vide Plate I, fig. 1.) pro- ceeding from the anterior to the posterior portion, after passing the first, second, third, and fourth pair of nerves, or the olfactory, optic, motor, and pathe- tic* nerves of the eye, the fifth pair is seen issuing from the medulla oblongata, or posterior tubercle of the brain. After quitting the cranium (confining the description to one side) it proceeds upwards, divides into two large branches, which go to clusters of mucous glands, situated in the front of the head, and at the interior margin of the electrical organs, and they appear to be confined to these parts. The next pair, the first electrical, rises close to the preceding, just behind it, and in passing out of the cranium is firmly connected wdth it; and also where it passes out, a portion of medullary matter proceeds from it into a cavity filled with fluid in the cartilage adjoin- * The nerves of the fourth pair are so very small and tender, that it is difficult to demonstrate them excepting in old and large torpedos.

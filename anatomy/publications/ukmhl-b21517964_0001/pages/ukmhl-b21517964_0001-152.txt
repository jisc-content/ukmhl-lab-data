EFFECTS OF THE POISON OF 132 liminary to that inquiry, being instituted to smooth the way, to determine, if possible, the mode of action of each poison, and furnish data for inferring what are the pure effects of the poison, what of the powers of nature opposing its effects, and what those of the medicine administered. In no sub- ject is discrimination more required than in this mysterious one; and, in no one perhaps has less judicious discrimination been used. It has often been taken for granted that the poison of all snakes is similar,—not differing in its kind, but only in its intensity of action; and, agreeably to this assumption, that the medicine useful in one instance must be serviceable in all. And, too often, medicines have got into repute as antidotes from being given in slight cases, in which recovery would have taken place without medical treatment,— beneficial changes that were due merely to the preservative powers of the constitution. The repu- tation that many Indian medicines, and especially that snake-stones have acquired, afford striking proof of the preceding remarks ; of three different kinds of these stones which I have examined, one consisted of partially burnt bone, another of chalk, and the third principally of vegetable matter ; this last resembled a bezoar. All of them (excepting the first, possessed of a slight absorbent power) were quite inert, and incapable of having any effect, exclusive of that which they might produce as

198 TEMPERATURE OF MAN, ETC. there not good reason to consider the two in the relation of cause and effect ? If animal heat be owing to nervous energy, or any way connected with the nervous system, why, it may be asked, are birds so much hotter than the mammalia ?—Why is the temperature of most quad- rupeds higher than that of man ? Or, if it be owing to digestion, and secretion, and animal action, why is the temperature of the am- phibia and of fishes so low, whose powers, in respect to these functions are so considerable ? Or, if it be connected with muscular energy, why are the animals, whose muscular powers are most re- markable (the animals belonging to all the lower classes), equally remarkable for the lowness of their temperature ? Or, lastly, if animal heat at all depend on pecu- liarities of structure or organization, why, it may be asked, is not the temperature of the amphibia eleva- ted like that of birds,—the structure of the respira- tory, and digestive, and secreting organs of the one class being so much like those of the other ?

71 ON THE TORPEDO. all nearly of the same size; and of all of them, the external yolk-bag had nearly disappeared, the portion remaining being less than a small pea. Most of them appeared inanimate; two or three-only moved their tails very slightly and the margins of the pectoral fins. They were as soon as possible transferred to fresh sea-water. After about two minutes, one or two of them began to move their water-valves.* I was now called away, and rather more than four hours elapsed before I returned. On my return I found them all freely respiring and moving about actively. They imparted smart shocks to the fingers or finger pressing the upper surface, and another of the same hand the under surface of the electrical organ;—they distinctly affected the galvanometer, and feebly magnetised needles through the medium of a spiral. These trials were made at ' 2 p.M.; at 10 p.M. all the fish were alive and viva- cious ; an hour after I found them all dead. The third fish I have to notice was a tremola, 17 inches long and 12|; broad. When brought on the evening of the Cth Nov. in a vessel of salt-water soon after it had been caught, it was tolerably viva- * I apply this term to the valves which arc situated at the open- ings behind the eyes, the ofhce of which appears to be to force water into the gullet to supply the branchiae ; which water, in regular respi- ration, passes out through the branchial apertures; but occasionally is discharged (the latter being closed) in considerable quantities, through the superior apertures. Bloch erroneously supposes, that these latter are the natural outlets. He says, “ Ils servent k I’animal a rejetter I’eau qu’il avale, soit en prcnant sa proie, soit celle qui entre par I’ouverture des ouics.”—Jlist. Nat. des Poissons, iij. 667.

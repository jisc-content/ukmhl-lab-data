30(j TECULIARITY OF STRUCTURE OCCURRINO 8. Varicose lacteals, also in plithisis. 9- Softening of the brain, especially of the for- nix, in this disease. 10. Ulceration of the larynx, also in this disease. 11. Pneumathorax from perforation of the pleura in connexion with a tubercular excavation. 12. Peritonitis, from perforation of intestine, in connexion with very limited local ulceration. 13. Ulceration and perforation of the appendicula vermiformis and consequent peritoneal inflam- mation. 14. Softening and wasting of the articular car- tilages, especially of the patellae. The list might be very much extended. It may perhaps be said, that there is deception in this matter; and that the asserted greater frequency of occurrence of any peculiarity of structure, or lesion, independent of obvious causes, is more apparent than real, and that were the same attention con- stantly given in search, the irregularity of their occurrence would cease. This may hold good in some instances; but I cannot admit that it is ap- plicable in those I have enumerated, and more especially in the peculiarity of structure of the band in the basilar artery, which led to the remark. In each case, the artery was carefully examined, and the result noted down at the time, and that spe- cially. And, moreover, in relation to the subjects of observation, what could be less favourable for uniformity of result ? Tbe individuals were not of

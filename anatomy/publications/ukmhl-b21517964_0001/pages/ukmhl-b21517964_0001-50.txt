EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 30 By exposure to the heat of boiling water for about sixteen hours, the different parts were com- pletely dried; their total weight was reduced to 322 grains, so that they had lost by drying 84.5 per cent. The electrical organs now weighed 22 grs.

I lay stress on matter not evapor- able, because I believe that the solid contents of the moist organs are less, and that the water which they contain holds in solution various substances. This solution may be obtained by cutting the electrical organs into small pieces, and placing them in a funnel. The fluid part slowly separates. What I have thus collected was slightly turbid, of a very light fawn colour, just perceptibly acrid; it

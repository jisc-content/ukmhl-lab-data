ON THE TORPEDO. ( sophical Transactions, that I made comparative trials with the same instruments on the salt water alone by contact. Referring to my notes, I find this dis- tinctly mentioned, and that no effects were perceptible; neither the needle in the spiral acquired the slightest degree of magnetic power, nor did the needle of the multiplier experience any divergence : fully satisfying me that the effects were owing to the peculiar power of the fish. Indeed, that this power was the cause, was manifest from the variability of the effects, in accord- ance in degree of strength with the energy of the torpedo, as indicated electrically by the sensation which its shock imparted. The experiments which I have instituted, with a view to ascertain if the electricity of the torpedo has any igniting power, or power of passing through air, and of producing light, have been attended with less satisfactory results. Very active fishes were tried on circles of perfect conductors, interrupted only by a space just visible with the aid of a powerful mag- nifier. The terminal wires, coated with sealing- wax, excepting at their extremities, were introduced through a perforated glass stopple, into a small glass globe, which was held in the hand of an assistant. The contacts were made in the dark ; but not the faintest spark could be perceived, nor could any ignition be perceived when the extreme points were connected with silver wire, not exceeding one-thou- sandth of an inch in diameter. When a torpedo was put into a metallic vessel.

38 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS ceive pure air may be deficient; and in my experi- ments, I have often fancied that I have witnessed something of the kind; after repeated discharges of its electricity, the margin of the pectoral fins has acquired an appearance as if very minute bubbles of air were generated in it and confined. Besides the electrical nerves, there is a fasciculus of nerves deserving attention, of great magnitude, formed by the junction of the anterior and posterior, or upper and under cervical nerves ; of the former, about seventeen on each side; of the latter, about fourteen.* It makes its appearance as one trunk just below the transverse cartilage which is inter- posed between the thorax and the abdomen. It sends a recurrent branch to the muscles and skin of the under surface of the thorax, but its main trunk ascends along the inner margin of the pectoral fin, and is distributed through it. On this fasciculus the sentient and motive powers of the parts connected with the electrical organs seem to depend. The electrical nerves at their origin are enveloped in a very thick fibrous sheath. As the branches subdivide in the substance of the organ, the neurilema becomes thin and semi-transparent. On examining a minute branch with a powerful lens, its internal or medullary substance is not seen in a continuous line, * Towards the origin of the spinal cord, there is a small space, from the under surface of which, six nerves arise, three on each side; hut none from the upper surface,—whence the difference of number noticed in the text.—Vide Plate I. fig. 2.

19 ON THE TORPEDO. two pounds formed part of the circle, the effect on the electrometer, though distinct, was less powerful than when it was omitted; and when a large copper coal-scuttle was substituted for it, the effect was still more diminished, the deviation of the needle being only just visible. Extension of surface, as in the instance of increased length of wire, had a sensible modifying effect: thus, in an experiment in which about a thousand feet of wire were used (formed of three pieces, two about one-fiftieth of an inch in diameter, the third piece considerably finer), the motion of the needle was decidedly slower than when a short length of wire was employed, though the space traversed by the needle was not percepti- bly different. I shall notice only a few of the ex- periments which I have made on imperfect con- ductors. When I have held the contact-wire in the palm of each hand wetted with salt water, and have touched with the fore-fingers the upper and under surface of a torpedo, I have felt its shocks distinctly ; but in no instance when the multiplier has been connected with the wires has it been affected; and when the spirals have been connected with them I have once only seen the needles in them converted into mag- nets. This effect accompanied a very smart shock from a young active fish, about six inches long, just taken. When the touching ends of the contact wires have been covered with leather soaked in salt wafer, or c 2

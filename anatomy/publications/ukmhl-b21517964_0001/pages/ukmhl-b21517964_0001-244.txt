224 TEMPERATURE OF FISHES contribute to the high temperature of these fish, both as regards its generation and preservation, I have intentionally been very general; in the pre- sent state of our knowledge I apprehend it would be useless to be more minute. It is not impos- sible that these fish may possess means for gene- rating heat peculiar to themselves, and of which at present we have no adequate idea. And the situation of the kidneys, of which a considerable portion is even higher than the stomach and pos- terior to the gills, of large size, and abounding in blood, and well supplied with nerves, w^ould lead to the conjecture, that these organs, in the function of imparting heat, may possibly act a part. Still, how- ever, reflecting on the great proportional size of the branchial nerves, and guided by analogy, it is difficult to resist the conclusion, that they are not principally concerned in the performance of the function in question, and that these nerves, as means, are so very ample on account of the element inha- bited, and the proportionally greater energy of function required to produce the same effect of elevation of temperature in the water and in the atmosphere. On any other view, it seems difficult to account for the branchial nerves of these fish being proportionally very much larger than the pulmonary nerves of the mammalia, and vastly larger than those of birds, of all animals the warmest.* Whether there is any immediate rela- * The size of the pulmonary nerves of birds, and indeed of their

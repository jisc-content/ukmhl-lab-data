An extremely minute quantity of fluid was procured from the vasa deferentia, of cream-like appearance; it contained some globules, and many minute particles, but no animalcules. 20.â€”Aged 41; died in consequence of the rup- ture of an aneurism of the thoracic aorta, not sus- pected during life. The dissection was made thirty- three hours after death. The body was muscular and robust as in perfect health. In the left pleura, into which the aneurism had opened, there were three and a-half pints of serum, and five and a-half pints of soft crassamentum. The viscera generally were sound. The vesiculse were examined thirty-eight hours after death, and the right vas deferens fifty-eight hours after.

In the drop of opaque fluid obtained from the vas deferens, no animalcules could be detected ; it contained very many minute particles, and many particles of an irregular form. In all these cases the testes were examined, as well as the vesiculse and the vasa deferentia. Except-

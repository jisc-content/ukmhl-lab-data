TEMPERATURE OF FISHES 222 function of the latter is performed by means of a particular organ, the most striking feature of which is a vast apparatus of nerves ; but this organization bears little or no analogy to any other natural, or to any artificial process hitherto known by which elec- tricity is generated. Not so, the respiratory appa- ratus and associated organs in these fish of high tem- perature, they are essentially analogous to those of the warm-blooded animals of the other two classes, and hardly more different from the respiratory appa- ratus and associated organs of the mammalia, than those of the mammalia are from those of birds. The function of respiration in water is commonly con- sidered similar to that in the atmosphere ; the same change, it is supposed, takes place in the blood in both instances; the same change is ascertained to take place in the air of the water and of the atmosphere ; and increase of temperature in one case and the other is referred to Ihe conversion of carbon into carbonic acid. The difficulty is not as regards the kind of effect, but the degree of that effect; not an augmentation of one or two degrees above the temperature of the surrounding medium, but of many degrees. A consideration of some of the peculiarities of these fishes may help to diminish this difficulty, which I have little doubt will be removed entirely, when we are better acquainted with their structure, and better acquainted with all the sources of animal heat. The most important peculiarities, are, I believe,

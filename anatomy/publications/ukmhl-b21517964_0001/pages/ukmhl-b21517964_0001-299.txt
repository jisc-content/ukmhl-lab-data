PNEUMATHORAX. 279 procured from one lung, which was sound, con- sisted of 8*3 carbonic acid 5*0 oxygen 86*7 azote: that from the other lung, which was in part con- densed, and as it were hepatized, of 12*5 carbonic acid 2’0 oxygen 85*5 azote: whilst, in another case, in which one lung was sound and the other abounded in minute cavities full of pus,—air from the sound lung consisted of 12*2 carbonic acid 3'0 oxygen 84*8 azote. Had the proportion of carbonic acid gas, in the instance under consideration, been within these limits, the explanation would have been attended with little difficulty; but, exceeding these limits, one is almost disposed to refer it to exhalation or secretion from the pleura. And if, at the same time, we suppose, that a similar exhalation took place into the bronchia, it might account for the sudden death. In support of this idea of the secretion or ex- halation of air into closed cavities, in addition to what has been already stated, I may notice the

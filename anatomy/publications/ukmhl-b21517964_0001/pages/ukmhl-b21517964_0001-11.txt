ADVERTISEMENT. A CONSIDERABLE portioD of this Work has already appeared in print. I have recourse to republica- tion, partly for the purpose of bringing together papers which are scattered in the Transactions of Societies, and in Journals not easy of access; and partly with a view to alterations, corrections, and additions, which either after-reading, or further research have enabled me to make; and lastly, with the hope that the collection thus formed may prove of use, both to the medical student and the medical inquirer. Fort Pitt, Chatham, September 7th, 1830. J. D.

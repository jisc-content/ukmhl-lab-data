8 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS insulated by a glass stand, and contacts were made on its back with the insulated wire resting on the edge of the vessel, or at a distance from it, luminous appearances were frequently produced, sometimes in the form of sparks, and sometimes in the form of flashes, not unlike summer lightning on an infinitely minute scale. At first, I was disposed to consider the phenomena electrical; but, on reflection, it occurred that they might depend on the presence of animalcules, which became luminous when agitated. And this I believe is the correct explanation of the effects ; for when the salt water was agitated without the torpedo, sparks of light now and then were seen, and the flashes or coruscations might have been owing either to luminous matter thrown off from the surface of the fish, when it gave a shock, or to the shock simultaneously stimulating several particles, which in consequence shone for an instant. The only positive result which I have obtained on the passage of the electricity of the torpedo through air, has been by using a chain as a substitute for a wire of communication. It was a small gold chain, composed of sixty double links, each circular, and about one-tenth of an inch in diameter, fastened, unstretched, to a dry glass rod at each end. Hold- ing the upper portion of this chain in one hand, and the under wire in the other (the hands being moist- ened), I irritated by means of them the upper and under surface of an active fish ; the shock which it gave was pretty strong, reaching beyond the fingers,

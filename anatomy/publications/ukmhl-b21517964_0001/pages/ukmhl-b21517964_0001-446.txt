XXIV. NOTICE OF A CASE IN WHICH THE ARTERIA INNO- MINATA AND THE LEFT SUBCLAVIAN AND CARO- TID ARTERIES WERE CLOSED WITHOUT LOSS OF LIFE. Sir Astley Cooper, in the first volume of Guy’s Hospital Reports, has given a valuable paper on the effects of tying the carotid and vertebral arteries in the dog and the rabbit, proving, that in the former animal both arteries may be suddenly and at the same time tied, without destruction of life, and that in the latter they may be successively tied with the same result,—the circulation of the blood in the brain, being continued by the admirable con- servative process of anastomosis. What Sir Astley Cooper has demonstrated as practicable in these animals, might be inferred analogically of man, taking into account the re- sults of ample experience on the ligature of all the larger arteries singly in different instances for aneu- rism, successful beyond even sanguine expecta- tion ; and a case which has come under my obser-

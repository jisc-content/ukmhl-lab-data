301 XVI. ON A PECULIARITY OF STRUCTURE OCCASIONALLY OCCURRING IN THE BASILAR ARTERY OF MAN. Besides those peculiarities of structure of the basilar artery which are well known, there is one of not uncommon occurrence which, to the best of my know- ledge, has not hitherto been noticed by any anato- mist. It is a band in tbe interior of the vessel, attached to its sides, and consequently intersecting it. (Vide Plate xiii. fig 2.) It varies both in its dimensions and situation. I have most frequently found it near the junction of the vertebral arteries ; very seldom near the commencement of the circle of Willis. Sometimes the band perfectly intersects the vessel; at other times only partially. Sometimes I have seen it not more than a line thick ; occasionally two or three lines. Its appearance, as regards its nature, has always been similar and most analogous to a fibrous structure. In every instance, I appre- hend, it may be considered as congenital, and not the effect of disease. This is inferred after careful examination to endeavour to detect the effects of diseased action. In no instance were there any

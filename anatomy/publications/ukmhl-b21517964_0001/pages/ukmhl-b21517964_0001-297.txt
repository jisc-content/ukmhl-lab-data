PNKUMATHOllAX. 277 In a professional point of view, it might be an in- teresting, though not an easy task, to trace the dif- ferent steps of the disease, of which I have given a brief history, from its commencement to its termina- tion, and connect the symptoms, with the organic changes which occurred. As more appropriate to this place, I shall confine the few remarks I have farther to make, to the air procured from the pleura. The following table exhibits, at one view, the com- position of the air collected from the chest at dif- ferent times. When Collected. COMPOSITION. Carbonic Acid. Oxygen. Azote.

I cannot conceive that they depended entirely on the admission of variable quantities of atmospheric air by the external open- ing ; because exceedingly little atmospheric air could enter through that channel, both from the great care taken to exclude it, and from the valvular

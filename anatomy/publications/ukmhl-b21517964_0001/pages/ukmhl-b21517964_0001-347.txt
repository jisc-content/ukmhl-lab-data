VESICULiE SEMINALES OF MAN. 327 entozoa,—the circular portion without the filament. The vesiculge were examined thirty-six hours after death. They contained pretty much fluid, of a just perceptible brownish hue, and of a gelatinous con- sistence. Very many well-formed animalcules ap- peared in it. It did not change the colour of tur- meric paper. 16.—Aged 33 ; died of complicated organic dis- ease of the bones, lungs, pleura, heart, peritoneum, &c. The dissection was made thirty-six hours after death. The body was exceedingly emaciated. The os frontis was carious, and in two places pene- trated through by ulceration; lymph was deposited underneath on the dura mater. The left clavicle was enlarged, softened, spongy, and unusually vas- cular. At the base of each semilunar valve of the aorta was a small bony concretion. The heart ap- peared atrophied. The pleurae were studded with small, white, firm tubercles. The right pleura con- tained sixteen ounces of serum; the left four ounces. In the inferior lobe of right lung, there were two circumscribed masses of coagulated blood. The cavity of the abdomen contained twelve pints of serum. The abdominal peritoneal lining generally was studded with tubercles similar in character to those of the pleurae, as was also the omentum, which, gathered into a long mass retained by adhesion, re- sembled a pancreas in its appearance. The kidneys were small and obscurely diseased. The left iliac and femoral vein, and the right femoral, were com-

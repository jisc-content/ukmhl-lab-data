272 TWO CASES OF stream of transparent fluid, fourteen ounces of which were allowed to escape; and, then, leaving the cannula in the perforation, it was closed with a cork, and secured by proper dressings. Daily, during six weeks, more or less fluid was discharged through the opening in the rib, amount- ing, altogether, to more than twenty pints. At first, the fluid was transparent, of specific gravity 1021 ; it coagulated when heated, and contained some alkali in the state of sub-carbonate. In a few days pus appeared in it, and gradually increased in quantity until the 15th of July, when the discharge was almost entirely purulent; after which time, the proportion of pus and serum varied considerably,— one sometimes predominating,—sometimes the other. It may be deserving of notice, that at no time was I able to detect free carbonic acid in the fluid dis- charged. Although, from the sound of fluctuation in the chest, air was evidently contained in the pleura, yet none escaped with the fluid during the first fort- night ;—afterwards a considerable quantity was daily expelled. By means of the perforation in the rib, and using a flaccid bladder, furnished with a trochar, I could, at any time, collect this air for examination, with perfect ease. The first portion collected (about twenty cubic inches) was on the 15th of July;—examined by means of lime-water and phosphorus, it was found to consist of

255 PNEUMATHORAX. was found to contain slight traces of carbonic acid gas, and to consist of 93 parts azotic gas, and 7 oxygen gas. The wound in the pleura was closed by coagulable lymph, and the pleura was found free from inflammation. The result then of this experiment seems to show, that the oxygen was absorbed in greater proportion than the azote, and thus tends to account for the accumulation of the latter gas in the preceding case. It may be said, that the experiment does not warrant the inference, that any azote was absorbed; and, consequently, that the expression “ in greater proportion,” is incorrect. The absorption of this gas is probable, however, though not demonstrated in the present instance, as Sir Astley Cooper has found, that common air introduced into the cellular membrane, and into the cavity of the thorax and abdomen of dogs, is, after a certain time, entirely removed by absorption.* Relative to the source of the carbonic acid gas, it is easy to conceive that this gas was formed, or emitted in the air cells of the lungs, as in ordinary respiration; and that mixing with the air inspired, it was received into the pleura. If thus derived, and not from the surface of the pleura by secretion, it seems to follow, that it is less readily absorbable by the pleura, than oxygen. To endeavour to de- cide this point, the following experiment was made. • Surgical and Physiological Essays, by John Abernethy, p. 55. London, 1793.

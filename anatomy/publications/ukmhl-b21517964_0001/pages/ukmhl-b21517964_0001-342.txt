FLUID IN THE 322 Very little fluid was found in the vesiculae semi- nales. It was partly thin, of a light brownish hue ; and partly thick and gelatinous,—the latter from the fundus, the former from the anterior portion. Under the microscope, a few spermatic animalcules were detected in the thin fluid, mixed with what appeared to be fragments of them. No animalcules were ob- served in the gelatinous fluid; it seemed to consist principally of mucus. Neither fluid had any effect on turmeric paper. From the vas deferens hardly sufficient fluid could be procured, even for micro- scopic examination. It contained a few minute glo- bular particles without any animalcules. 12.—Aged 33; died of diffuse cellular inflammation of the neck, with suppuration of the cervical glands. The dissection was made twenty-six hours after death. A superficial cavity was found in the cerebrum, under the posterior part of the right parietal bone, which contained about a drachm and half of fluid, which became turbid on the addition of nitric acid. There had been no suspicion of cerebral disease during life. The cellular tissue of the neck gene- rally was saturated with thick purulent matter; and most of the cervical glands were diseased and con- tained abscesses. The right sterno-cleido-mastoideus muscle, on its under side, appeared wasted and cor- roded, and presented a suppurating surface. A small mass of fibrin, softened internally, adhered to the inner coat of the right internal jugular vein. Neither the integuments, larynx, oesophagus, or

ITS SUPPOSED EFFECTS. 353 considerable. When I have pressed with the fingers forcibly on the compresses applied to the wound, expecting at the moment to arrest the bleeding, I have been disappointed,â€”it has continued. It has only ceased when the compresses have been secured, and not tightly, by a roller passed round the neck of the animal. And further, in illustration, I may re- mark that I have been equally disappointed in using graduated compresses, ensuring considerable pressure on the wound. This method has failed, when general moderate pressure effected by com- presses about two inches long, and one wide, suc- ceeded. And, on reflection, the difference of result is perhaps what might be expected; the severe pressure can hardly arrest the bleeding except by pressing the sides of the vessel together, and closing the canal, the accomplishment of which requires a most nice adaptation, and a force, which cannot easily be applied with steadiness except by me- chanical means, and in situations affording firm sup- port beneath. Should the expectation which I have ventured to form of this method of stopping the bleeding of wounded arteries of a large size, in man, be realized on trial, I need not point out how very useful it may prove in military surgery, how very available it will be in the field and in battle, especially in great actions, when however numerous and well appointed the medical staff of an army, the number of wounds requiring attention must always exceed the means VOL.

440 FATAL CASE OF RUPTURE OF HEART, ETC. These particulars of this very uncommon case, were noted down at the time. Taking them all into consideration, it seems most probable, that the sol- dier lost his way in a lonely night-walk, and coming to the brink of the precipice stepped over and fell on his feet, or rather perhaps, on the one (the left) the neck of the thiofh-bone of which was fractured. o On this supposition the unbruised state of the integu- ments, the uninjured state of the clothes, and the oblique or diagonal position of the body in relation to the foot of the precipice, as well as the kind of fracture, seem to be tolerably accounted for. Relative to the fatal injuries, the rupture of the left auricle, and the double rupture of the aorta,—I apprehend, that, reasoning d priori, conjectures only can be olfered as to the manner in which they were produced ; and especially taking into account a fact, which occurred about tbe same time, and of the accuracy of which I am well assured, viz. that a lad fell down the same precipice and alighted on his feet without sustaining the slightest injury. But, however explained, whether on the supposition that the lacerations were owing to muscular action,—to the violent contraction of the left auricle and ventri- cle ; or, to other causes in conjunction with such action,—the effects themselves seemed to demon- strate, that where they took place, there was a greater tendency to yield and to rupture than else- where, at least in this particular case. Thinking it probable that elucidation might be

To ascertain the truth of these inferences, the following experiments were made. , On the same day, February 8, 1833, in the pre- sence of several medical officers, I divided partially transversely the carotid artery of two dogs; one, small and feeble, the other, of moderate size and strong. In each instance, the bleeding was most profuse, till compresses dipped in common water had been applied and secured by a bandage, which, as in the caseof the goat already given, completely stopped the hemorrhage. The small dog, from the proportionally large quantity of blood which it lost, was very feeble im- mediately, and appeared to be dying; but it pre- sently rallied, and for several days seemed to be doing well. It unexpectedly died on the 15th, seven days after the infliction of the wound. The bandage during this time had not been touched, and no appli- cation had been made. Now, on exposing the neck, the wound was found covered with coagulable lymph, discharging pus, and on dissecting out the artery and the eighth nerve contiguous to it, a mass of coagu- lable lymph appeared lying over -the wound in the vessel, extending about half an inch above and below it. This mass of coagulable lymph having been carefully removed, and the artery slit open, the vessel

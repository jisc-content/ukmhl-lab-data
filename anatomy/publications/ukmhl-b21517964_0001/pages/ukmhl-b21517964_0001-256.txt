23(3 TEMPERATURE OF THE instances columnar, and the cavities intersected by columns containing blood-vessels, and by blood-ves- sels almost bare. Their contents were a viscid bilious purulent fluid ; and its yellow colour was apparently derived from bile discharged from the ulcerated ends of the branches of the biliary duct, indicated by bright dark-yellow spots on the surface of the exca- vations. In the situation of the vena portae, there was a large sinus, which was ruptured by introducing the thermometer under the lobulus Spigelii; it dis- charged a fluid similar to that described above. On minute examination, this sinus, lined with ragged coagulable lymph, and about thrice the size of the vena portae, was found to be that vein itself vastly diseased: and the veins which terminate in the vena portae were found terminating in it, empty, and their abrupt terminations in this sinus or sac closed with coagulable lymph. The hepatic artery, vein and duct (at least their trunks), were not diseased. The spleen was of usual size and appearance, but unusually compact and hard. A thermometer intro- duced into the centre of the cerebrum, so soon as the skull-cap was removed, rose to 70°; about half an hour after when placed under the right ventricle of the heart, it rose to 82°, and the same under the right lobe of the liver. These examples, which I have introduced in the order, in point of time, in which they occurred, are the only ones in which I tried the temperature of the body after death, in a warm climate. They

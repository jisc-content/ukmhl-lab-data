8(j EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS and of particular study, especially that of the in- teguments, in which the mucous organs are very strongly developed. As before mentioned, the cutaneous mucous sys- tem consists of two parts,—of clustered glandules by which the mucus probably is chiefly secreted, and of excretory ducts or tubes by which it is conveyed to and distributed over the surface. The two figures in Plates X. and XI. display the glandular and tubular structure: one is a drawing of a small torpedo oculata, the integuments partially dissected and reflected, one electrical organ removed, and a principal cluster of glandules and their ducts thereby brought into view;—the other is from a carefully made drawing of a fish of the same size and kind in its natural state, shewing the mucous tubes distributed under And the spine itself of G5‘5 Phosphate of lime and carbonate, with some saline matter. 24'2 Animal matter. 10-3 Water. 100-0 Whilst the cartilage of the great pectoral fin consisted of 3-7 Phosphate and carbonate of lime, with some saline matter. 19-1 Animal matter. 72'2 Water. 100-0 They w'ere taken fresh from the fish and wiped apparently dry, before subjected to experiment. The spine and its tubercle retained their form after the action of fire: the cartilage lost its form.

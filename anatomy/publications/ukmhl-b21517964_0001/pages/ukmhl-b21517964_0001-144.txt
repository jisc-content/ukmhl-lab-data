EFFECTS OF THE POISON OF 124 auricles, and the right ventricle, and the great veins, and arteries, were distended with coagulated blood. When first exposed, the heart was motionless ; after the removal of the pericardium, the auricles exhibited, for a few seconds, a slight tremulous action. In the brain, lungs, and other viscera, no diseased ap- pearances could be detected. The vessels generally were distended with coagulated blood. The muscles were very flaccid, and could not be stimulated to the feeblest contraction, immediately after death; even the pectoral muscles, when divided, showed no signs of irritability, nor did the intestines. Where the wound had been inflicted, the skin and the muscle underneath were a little darker than natural, as if from a minute portion of extravasated blood. The muscular fibre was extremely soft and weak; slight pressure on the muscles occasioned the exudation of a little watery fluid, and some minute globules of air. There was not the slightest swelling of the part, or appearance of local inflammation. Experiment 2.—About half an hour after the preceding experiment, a full-grown fowl was exposed to the snake. Even more provocation was required in this instance than in the first, to excite the snake to act;—at length he bit the fowl in the wing ; the fangs penetrated the loose skin and drew a little blood. At the moment, the fowl did not appear to suffer any pain, or to be in any way affected. In about a quarter of a minute, by a second-watch, its

EXPERIMENTS AND ODSERVATIONS 84 nate in a point. Slightly moveable, they offer no resistance to objects entering, they yield and allow them to pass into the gullet; but not so in the contrary direction; pressed on from behind, they are raised so as to be nearly, not quite erect; acting as hooks they effectually prevent their prey from passing out. The teeth are very numerous; I estimated the number of those attached to one lip at 180. So small were they, that including the integument in which they were fixed, and that in its moist state, they weighed only half a grain. Their form is best brought into view by the action of fire. Before the blowpipe, the membrane to which they are attached burns with flame, and the teeth remain unchanged in shape.* They are now seen to consist of a broad irregular basis, by which they were fixed, and from which the projecting conical exposed part arises. Like scale-armour the bases are so arranged as to be flexible only inwards. Chemically examined, I have found them to consist of phosphate of lime, and a little car- bonate of lime and animal matter: the proportions of each I have not ascertained. Their form is not altered either by the solvent power of an acid ex- ercised on the earthy ingredients, or by the decom- posing effect of fire acting on the animal matter.f * If the heat of the blow-pipe is long continued, the teeth fall to powder. t Analog}â€™ would lead to the inference, that the composition of

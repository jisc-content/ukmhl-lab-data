ON THE ACTION OF VINEGAR, ETC. 377 of the vegetable principles which they hold in solu- tion, they are liable to vary in the changes which they themselves undergo, and in their effects on the animal textures immersed in them. It might be expected, perhaps, that the solvent power of vinegar, on the textures of the body, would be considerable; but, experiment proves it to be otherwise. In 1828, whilst stationed in Malta, por- tions of aorta, dura mater, brain, nerve, muscle, in- testine, skin, liver, and intervertebral substance, were put into this acid, in a vessel not completely filled, and from which atmospheric air was not completely excluded. This was done in the month of January; at the end of six months, all the parts were in good preservation. The acid retained its transparency, but was slightly coloured, and there was a slight sediment. I may mention farther, to shew how very inconsiderable is the solvent power of this acid, that on evaporation, it afforded only a very minute re- sidue, of a light brown colour, semi-transparent, viscid and bitter: the greater part of which was solu- ble in water. The colourless acid produces very little change of colour in any of the textures on which I have tried it,â€”unless the parts were gorged with blood; and then the alteration is referrible to the blood, the colouring matter of which, when not concentrated, is changed to brownish green; and, when concentrated, to almost black. To ascertain the degree of dilution, which the

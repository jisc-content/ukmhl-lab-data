42 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS Mr. Hunter, from the examination of a torpedo whose vascular system was injected, states that the electrical organs of this fish are abundantly sup- plied with blood-vessels. From what I have wit- nessed in the living fish, and the fresh fish recently dead, I am compelled to conclude that the quantity of blood w'hich circulates through them is very in- considerable. The blood-vessels which pass into them with the electrical nerves are small; the organs are colourless, and very few branches car- rying red blood are perceptible, extending through them. The integuments of these organs, and the pectoral fins, and lateral clusters of mucous glands are indeed abundantly supplied with blood-vessels ; the contrast of the vascularity of these parts, and of the electrical organs, is so strongly marked as to suggest the idea, that the latter can possess very little ordinary vital activity, and that in accordance, wdth the common analogies of living parts, they must be rather passive than active. Some circumstances pertaining to the integu- ments of the electrical organs are deserving of notice. I have found that the skin covering these organs above is not only more coloured, but also thicker than that covering them below', and more vascular, and surrounded by more powerful muscles, and supplied with a greater quantity of mucus; whilst the under surface appears to have a larger proportion of subcutaneous nerves. This difference of structure in the two surfaces of the electrical

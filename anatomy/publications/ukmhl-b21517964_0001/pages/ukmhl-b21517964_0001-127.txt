107 BY THE COMMON TOAD, they were made, and they were published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1826; they were limited to the common toad, (Rana Bufo, L.) and were nearly as follows : In carefully examining the toad, I found it pos- sessed of a peculiar fluid, seated chiefly in the in- teguments, in follicles, in the cutis vera, beneath the cuticle and the coloured rete mucosum. These follicles were largest and most numerous near the shoulders and about the neck of the animal; but they were far from being confined to these parts, they were very generally distributed, and even on the extremities. Pressure being applied to the skin, a yellowish thick fluid, the fluid in question, exuded, occasionally it even spurted to a consider- able distance. No difficulty was experienced in collecting it, from large and old animals, in suffi- cient quantity for examination. The following are some of the properties of the specimen which was subjected to experiment. The greater part of it was soluble in alcohol and water. The aqueous solution was slightly viscid, and did not pass readily through a common filter. It was not precipitated by acetate of lead; and its transparency was very slightly impaired by a solu- tion of corrosive sublimate. The substance ob- tained by evaporation, both from the aqueous and alcoholic solution, was light yellow and transparent; had a faint and peculiar smell different from that of the toad; and it was slightly bitter and very

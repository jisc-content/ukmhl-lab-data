2[)4 EFFECTS OF THE SUN’s RAYS black surface is laid on the semitransparent cuticle, whilst, in the other, it is situated under the cuticle, and on the surface of the cutis. In the one in- stance, the extinguishing medium is external to the insensible covering of the body; in the other, it is in contact with the sensitive surface, and may be considered as a part of it. Circumstances, too, rela- tive to the very great penetrating power of the sun’s rays, have had rather a similar tendency to augment my doubts of the strict accuracy of this analogical conclusion. As the facts which I now allude to, appear to me to be new and curious, I shall mention some of them. When the sun’s rays are concen- trated by a lens, they penetrate, I find, through bone, as a portion of the cranium;* through nine folds of black crape; and, what is more extraordi- nary, through rolled platinum. It was easy to as- certain their penetrating through the former sub- stances, by a luminous point appearing on a surface beneath; but through the opaque platinum no light passed, yet the rays of heat passed, which was best indicated by the sensation produced, when the metal was placed on the sensitive skin, the only part of which affected was that corresponding to the focus of the lens, the metal itself not becoming sensibly warmer.f Taking, then, into consideration the dif- ference between the painted cuticle and the dark * This circumstance may help to explain the effect of the sun on the brain, in producing that malady commonly called coup de soleil. t No effect was produced through the platinum on moist chloride of silver.

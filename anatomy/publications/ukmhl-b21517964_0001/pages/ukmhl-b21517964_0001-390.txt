370 ON THE APPLICATION OF SULPHUROUS The sulphurous acid enables one to detect the slightest ulceration of mucous membranes, existing even in so inconsiderable a degree, that, without this aid, it might escape detection. It enables one, too, to detect the cicatrices of old ulcers ;* to detect coagLilable lymph poured out and adhering to their surface, even in the intestines, constituting a false membrane ; and to notice many other changes in relation to the different coats, vessels, &c. which it would be tedious to enumerate. It shews equally well the effects of disease on serous membrane, on the blood-vessels, and on the viscera, especially the lungs. I have, in my posses- sion, preserved in this acid, a very delicate specimen of tubercles on a portion of pleura costalis, covered with a very fine net-work of coagulable lymph, and, after several months, it is as distinct as when first immersed, and more distinct than before it was in- troduced into the acid. A portion of hepatised lung, thus preserved, shews the air-cells filled with an albuminous deposition, and the blood-vessels closed with the same, and the minute branches of the bron- chia. And a vomica, which has been kept in this glass, full of water, perfectly clear ; very slight changes in the deli- cate structure of the part, before obscure, or not to be distinguished, will become apparent and distinct; and more particularly, very slight lesions and changes, whether recent or old, of the mucous membranes. * These cicatrices, from the observations which I have made, seem to differ chiefly from sound mucous membrane, in containing no follicles, when the previous ulceration has been deep ; and, when only superficial,! n exhibiting a structure more or less different from that of the parti n health.

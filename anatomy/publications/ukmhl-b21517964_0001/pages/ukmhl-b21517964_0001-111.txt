91 ON THE TORPEDO. minates, after penetrating the intestine, in a very fine short papilla. The spleen is comparatively large and firm; the pancreas small: both in relative situation and structure, these organs very much resemble those of the mammalia. The kidneys are of moderate size, extremely lobulated, and resemble very much those of reptiles. They communicate each by a single delicate ureter with the extremity of the in- testine, into which they enter separately, very little apart from each other, a little posterior to the entrance of the vasa deferentia in the male, and of the uterine cavities of the female. Their secre- tion is, it may be inferred, liquid urine, and it pro- bably is voided almost as rapidly as it is secreted. I have in vain attempted to collect it for exami- nation. The heart of the torpedo is large for the size of the fish. Its single ventricle, communicating with the pulmonary artery, is thick, red, and very mus- cular. The trunk of the pulmonary artery rising from it, is provided with nine valves apparently muscular, arranged in three contiguous rows. Above the valves it gives off laterally, at right angles, three branches on each side, and terminates in a central main branch, which soon divides, and again redivides, to proceed to the gills. The ventricle communicates with a single auricle by a passage furnished with six valves, attached by delicate tendinous cords. The thin auricle, capable of much

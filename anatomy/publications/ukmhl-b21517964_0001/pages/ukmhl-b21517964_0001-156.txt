130 ON THE STRUCTURE OF 1825, in the Ionian Islands, satisfied me that my doubt was well founded. Selecting old and large animals, especially the toad, which in the Ionian Islands often attains a great size, I experienced but little difficulty in de- monstrating the bi-auricular structure of its heart. It was best effected by making an incision into the ventricle, and inflating the organ with the blow-pipe. By this method, with the aid of fine probes, mani- pulating under water, it was clearly proved that the heart of the animal has two auricles, which are divided by a transparent membranous septum, pos- sessing fibres, which appear to be muscular; that they communicate with the ventricle by a common and very short passage, and that they have no com- munication with each other, excepting in the pass- age above the valves common to both. The same fact as to structure, I found mio-ht o also be demonstrated, by blowing air through either of the two pulmonary veins which return the blood from the lungs to the heart; or, by inflating the sinuses in which the venae cavae terminate. By inflation of either of the pulmonary veins, the pul- monic auricle was distended, and not the systemic. By inflation of the sinuses of the venae cavae, the contrary effect was produced, shewing, at the same time, that the margin of the septum was qualified to act the part of a valve, and prevent the blood of one auricle from passing into the other. But even supposing the margin of the septum

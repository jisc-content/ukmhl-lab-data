56 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS one over each kidney, which from its function may be called a uterine cavity, formed, like the duct itself, of an inner membrane, and of a peritoneal outer coat, connected together by loose filamentous tissue, and opening into the lower part of the intestine or cloaca, by a common mouth, a little posterior to the minute papilla—the termination of the ureters. In the oviduct, just above its enlargement into the ute- rine cavity, there is only a slight trace of a glandular structure ; in which respect the torpedo seems equally to differ from the different species of squalus, and of ray—all those wdiich I have examined of either genus being possessed of a large glandular body in the situation mentioned. The male generative organs consist of two firm oval testes, occupying the same situation as the ovaria in the female, and not very different in appear- ance,—of vasa deferentia, without vesiculaB seminales, and of a papilla in the cloaca, the common termi- nation of the seminal and urinary passages, near the verge of the intestine. Like the squali and the rays in general, the male torpedo is provided with two appendages, one on each side of the anus, composed of articulated bones, of muscles, of cartilages, and a glandular structure. The eggs of the torpedo, I have never found in the oviduct in their passage, only in the ovaria, or attached to the ovaria, or in the uterine cavities. When mature, and attached to the ovaria, they are covered with a vascular membrane, through which

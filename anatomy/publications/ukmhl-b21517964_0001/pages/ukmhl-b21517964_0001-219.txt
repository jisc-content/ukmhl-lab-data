199 IX. OBSERVATIONS ON THE EFFECT OF VIOLENT EXER- CISE ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BODY. Whilst I was in Ceylon, I made a few observations on the effect of severe exercise on the temperature of man, which, although less perfect and extended than I could wish, may be deserving of insertion here. On the 5th of July, 1817, preparatory to setting out on a journey, I tried the temperature, both under the tongue, and in the axilla, of six natives belong- ing to a set of palankeen bearers, in good health and quite cool, at about seven o’clock in the morning, when the temperature of the air was 80”. The re- sults were the following.— No. Age. Therm, under Tongue. Axilla. 1 35 98*5 - 2 30 99° 97° 3 35 98-5 96° 4 32 98*5 96° 5 35 99° 96° 6 33 100° 98°

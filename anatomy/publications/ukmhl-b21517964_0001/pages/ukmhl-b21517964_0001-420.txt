PROPORTION OF CALCAREOUS AND 400 Table V. Proportion of Calcareous and Ammal Matter in Diseased Bones. No. Description of Bone. Calcar. Matter. Animal Matter. 1 The body of a large thigh-bone of an adult affected with hyperostosis, very thick and hard, but not very compact 76-9 23-1 2 The bone of a person supposed to have died of lues venerea, thick, light and spongy in a slight degree* ..... 70-7 29-3 3 Cancelli of a curved tibia .... 74-5 25‘5 4 The compact body of the same bone 63-0 37-0 5 A portion of rickety parietal bone, about an inch thick 72-9 27-1 6 Another portion of the same bone G9-5 30-5 7 The body of a rickety thigh bone, very thick 62-2 37*8 8 An exostosis ...... 63-8 3G-2 9 A scrofulous exostosis .... G3-0 37-0 10 A spinal process of a lumbar vertebra of the curved spine of a rickety person 59-3 40-7 11 A rib of the same person .... 59-2 40-8 12 The tibia of a rickety child, soft and spongy 2G-0 74-0 13 A deformed female pelvis: soft and porous, and not unlike horn in appearance 24-2 75-8 14 Portion of detached necrosed bone 59-2 40-8 15 Callus of fractured femur of an adult, sup- posed to be very old: in appearance very dense,—denser than the shaft 52-4 47-G * Death from lues venerea seems to be very problematical; and disease of bones as an effect of sj’philis, seems also to be problemati- cal. After an experience of nearly 25 years in the army, I do not recollect having witnessed a fatal event consequent on lues venerea fairly attributable to it alone. When such an event has occurred more or less remotely following syphilis,—tubercles or other organic disetise have been developed, and have been the principal cause of death. And I have never met with any instance in which in se- condary syphilis the bones had been diseased, unless mercury had been used. In offering these remarks, it is not my intention to main- tain that secondary syphilis is never complicated with disease of bones : it may be so, and any other disease may be so complicated, accidentally, not essentially,—bone being liable to morbid action from a variety of causes, and which may take effect during the pro- gress of other diseases.

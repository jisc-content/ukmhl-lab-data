147 ON ANIMAL HEAT. ments, so that, if required, I should be inclined to give the numbers thence deduced, as the greatest approximation to the truth. 2.— On the Comparative Temperature of Venous and Arterial Bloody and of different Parts of the Animal Body. To endeavour to ascertain the comparative tem- perature of venous and arterial blood, I have made a considerable number of experiments; some of which, on lambs, sheep, and oxen, it will be sufhcient for me in this place to describe. In each instance a long incision was made through the integuments, the jugular vein was laid bare, and the exact seat of the carotid artery found. The vein was then opened, and a small delicate thermometer introduced, and thrust about an inch up the vessel beyond the wounded part, and as the bulb of the instrument was small, the flow of blood was not stopped. When the mercury was stationary, its height was marked. The carotid artery next was divided, and the ther- mometer was immersed in the current of blood, and left there till it ceased to rise. The following are the results of five experiments made on lambs, all of which were about three months old. The thermometer in the shade stood at 65". 1.

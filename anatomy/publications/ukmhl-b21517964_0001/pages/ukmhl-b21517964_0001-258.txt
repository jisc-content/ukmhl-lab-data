238 TEMPERATURE OF THE menced. Even if it had, and had made progress, and were it even at its greatest height of activity, it is doubtful if it would be equal to the production of the effect in question ? It may be matter of regret, that the temperature in the two first examples, was not ascertained before as well as after death. It is only known that the skin of No. 1, the day he died, was pungently hot —the expression I believe used by Dr. White, the zealous medical officer under whose care he was. As the weather at the time was oppressively hot, and the sensations of those in health, as well as of those labouring under disease, distressing more or less in relation to heat, less attention naturally would be paid to the degrees, and there would be the more difficulty in distinguishing them, and saying this is natural,—that morbid. As the facts stand (and I trust I may venture to call these observations such), they may tend to put medical inquirers on their guard relative to the ex- treme limits of degree of animal temperature, and especially of the blood and deeply seated parts. If the temperature of a body, as in No. 1, be 113°, three hours and a half after death ; and, if generated during life, before death it must have been still higher. Let us suppose some part of this individual inflamed, and observations made on the heat of the inflamed part; it is easy to conceive that its tem- perature might be found unusually high, — and greatly exceeding the average temperature of the

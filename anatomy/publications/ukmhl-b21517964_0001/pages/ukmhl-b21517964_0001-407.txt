It is to be regretted, that sea scurvy which for many years was almost unknown amongst our invalids returning from our distant colonies, has lately become of not unfrequent occurrence, especially amongst old soldiers from India; and is to be attributed mainly to due attention not being paid to the health and comfort of the men on these long voyages; the provisions are often of bad or indif- ferent quality; lime juice is seldom supplied in sufficient quantity or given in a judicious manner, and there is too often a neglect of atten- tion to dryness and ventilation between decks. c c 2

THE URINARY BLADDER AFTER DEATH. 411 of conjecture how the effect takes place. Other organs exhibit phenomena somewhat similar. In phthisis, shortly before death, it is not uncommon to witness a cessation of distressing pectoral symptoms, and a return of comparatively easy respiration. In insanity, complicated with organic disease of either the thoracic or abdominal viscera, and especially with tubercular disease, it generally happens that the destructive malady runs its course, without appa- rently deranging the functions of the organs in which it is seated. In all organic diseases, and most dis- tinctly marked in instances of chronic disease of the heart, there are marked periods of rest, as well as of exacerbation. And during the fits of aggravation, certain medicines, as narcotics, timely administered, often have the effect of affording great and sudden re- lief, seemingly allaying the deranged functions and restoring the organ to its healthy state of action. Lastly, it may be remarked, that, the functions of most organs, even when free from organic dis- ease, are liable to irregularities; as the sudden blush, the quickening of the pulse, the open- ing of the pores and bursting forth of sweat, the sudden change of the urinary secretion, be- coming at once excessive in quantity and ex- tremely dilute,â€”all connected with mental emotion. Now as in these instances, the modifying effect, appears to depend on the nervous system, exerting some peculiar influence; it seems not improbable, that in the last stage of life, a similar influence may

TEMPERATURE OF FISHES. 219 seated muscles, in the thickest part of the fish, a little below the gills, I found to be 99Â°, when the surface of the sea, from which it had just before been taken, was 80*5, the difference being, the very remark- able one of eighteen degrees and half.* This fact necessarily made a strong impression on my mind, on account of its singularity; at Malta, in 1833-4, when examining the heart and gills of the tunny, of the Mediterranean, {thyn- nus vulgaris^ Cuv. and Valen.) my attention was recalled to it, on finding that the latter were supplied with nerves of unusual magnitude; that the heart, like that of the Bonito, was very powerful; that the fish equally, or even more abounded in blood ; and that its muscles generally, like those of the Bonito, from the same cause, were of a dark-red colour. It immediately occurred to me that its temperature also might be high, analogous to that of the Bonito ; and the result of careful inquiry amongst the fishermen of most experience in the tunny fishery, confirmed the conjecture. All who were asked, declared that the tunny is warm-blooded ; and one of the most intelligent, when questioned as to the degree of heat, said, it was much the same, or little less than that of the blood of a pig, when fiowing from the divided vessels of the neck on being killed ; and this man was very competent to give an opinion on the sub- ject, having been much employed in the fisheries on * Vide p. 218.

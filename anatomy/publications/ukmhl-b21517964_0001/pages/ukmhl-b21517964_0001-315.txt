ON THE SKIN. 295 rete mucosum, and tliis very remarkable pene- trating power of the sun’s rays, it appeared to me that more direct experiments than those of Sir Eve- rard Home were requisite, to ascertain, beyond all doubt, if the function of the colouring matter of the skin of the Negro is really such as it has been inferred to be. With a view to this, I have sub- jected the skin of the Negro to the direct rays of the sun, and I have made a similar trial on a mole on a fair skin. After two hours exposure to the sun, its rays moderately concentrated by a lens, (for the experiment was made in winter when the tem- perature was between 50° and 60°) the part acted on, in which a dark brown mole was situated, became slightly red; the following day it was red, and just perceptibly painful; and about the fourth or fifth day, desquamation of the part commenced. The desquamation took place over the mole as well as the adjoining fair part, and the mole was evidently rendered of a darker colour. On the 27th December, when the sky was clear, and Fahrenheit’s thermome- ter in the shade at 56°, a similar experiment was made on the fore-arm of a Negro, and continued the same time. The skin acted on was a little hotter than the rest, just perceptibly darker, and it felt, he said, slightly sore. On the following day, the part appeared to be very little darker, and he said that it was slightly painful and swollen, but this last mentioned effect was not perceptible to my eye. On the 31st December, the pain had ceased; there

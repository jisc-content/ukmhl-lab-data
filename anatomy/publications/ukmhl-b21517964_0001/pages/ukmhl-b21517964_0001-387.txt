ACID TO ANATOMICAL PURPOSES. 3G7 from that of the other nerves, as has been lately maintained. It displays, too, almost without dissection, the composition of the vessels, and, I may add, of the passages and canals of the body generally; owing to its expanding, in different degrees, the several coats of which thev consist. Â«/ The manner in which it exhibits the muscles is most distinct in all the details of their anatomical structure. A transverse section of a long muscle, well steeped in strong sulphurous acid, is an in- teresting anatomical object. With the naked eye its constituent parts may be clearly seen, the blood- vessels and nervous filaments, the muscular fibres collected in bundles of different sizes, and con- nected by cellular tissue and ligamentous threads. The effect of the acid on other compound parts is not less instructive. Were I to describe the ap- pearance which the more important only exhibit in this fluid, I should greatly exceed the limits to which it appears desirable to confine the description. In this part of my subject I shall restrict myself to one ex- ample, which I select, as being well adapted to illus- trate the effects of the acid on an organ variously compounded. This example is the penis : immersed in the acid, it swells like a sponge when put into water, and very soon becomes completely distended ; then, when the cutis has been dissected off, its liga- mentous sheath is brought beautifully into view, with the nerves and vessels on the dorsum penis running

EFFECTS OF THE POISON OF 120 taken, and very active. At Colombo, in December, 1816, it bit a puppy, about two months old, in two places,—the side of the face, and the foot of one of the hind legs. Immediately, judging from his howl- ing, the animal seemed to sutfer much pain ; he ran away, when liberated, on three legs, making no use of the wounded leg. A drop of blood came from each wound.

In about forty-eight hours, the swelling had nearly disappeared, and the animal seemed to have recovered his health. The wounds had sphacelated extensively and deeply, and a puru- lent discharge had commenced.

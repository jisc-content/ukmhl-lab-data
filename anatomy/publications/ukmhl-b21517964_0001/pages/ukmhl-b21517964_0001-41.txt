ON THE TORPEDO. 21 a free current of gas rose from the point connected with the under contact wire, and not a particle from the other point. In these experiments, there were interposed at the same time the chemical apparatus, one on each side ; the spiral, one also on each side ; and the multiplier intermediate; and there were necessarily many junctions of wires. And in an after experiment, in addition to these, an air thermometer (Harrisâ€™s Electrometer) was introduced, and very dis- tinctly affected. I scarcely need add that in an ex- periment made expressly to ascertain this point, the shock of the fish was felt beyond the saline solution ; for it had been previously proved by the experiments of Mr. Walsh, that salt water, even in a long circuit of imperfect conductors, has a power of transmitting the electricity of the torpedo. The tests or indications of the electricity of the torpedo, at present known, are six in number; namely, the physiological effect, as the sensation it imparts is sometimes called ; the chemical effects, as the precipitation of iodine, the decomposition of water, &c.; its effects on the thermometer, on the galvanometer, and on steel in the spiral. These different tests, in point of delicacy, I am inclined to believe, are in the order in which they are enumerated. That the two first should be placed highest, and that sensation should have the precedence, the experi- ments which I have made appear to prove indepen- dently of all analogy.

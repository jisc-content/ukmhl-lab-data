TEMPERATURE OF MAN 162 3dly. I shall relate the results of my experiments on the temperature of different kinds of animals. And, I shall conclude, with drawing such inferences as the premises may seem to warrant, and with making a few remarks on animal heat, as a specu- lative question. 1.— Of the Variable Temperature of Man. In a voyage from England to Ceylon, in the year 1816, I had an opportunity of observing the effect of passing from one zone to another on the tempera- ture of man. It was in winter, in the month of February, that we set sail from England. I commenced my obser- vations in March, when we began to experience the tropical heat; and on the 10th of the month, when our ship was in latitude N. 9° 42', the weather fine, an agreeable breeze blowing, and when Fahrenheit’s thermometer, exactly at noon, under an awning, where the passengers were assembled, was 78°. The gentlemen who were so obliging as to allow me to try their temperature, were all in good health, had breakfasted about three hours before, had taken little exercise, and though warm in respect to sensation, they were not disagreeably so, or sensibly perspiring. In each instance the temperature was ascertained, by placing a delicate thermometer under the tongue, near its root, every precaution being taken to insure accuracy. The following were found to be the temperatures of seven different gentlemen:

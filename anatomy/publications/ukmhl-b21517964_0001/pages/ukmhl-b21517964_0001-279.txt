PNEUMATHORAX. 259 by a solution of the green sulphate of iron, and of 93’1 azote. On opening the chest, the wounds in the pleura were found closed; the pleurae were of natural appearance; the substance of the left lung was redder than usual, and that of the right was dark red, and it contained a good deal of blood and serum. The bronchia did not exhibit decided marks of inflammation. The right auricle, and ventricle, and venae cavae were distended with grumous blood; and the left auricle and ventricle, and aorta con- tained a good deal of liquid blood, which, as well as that of the venous system, had lost its peculiar tint, and had acquired a chocolate hue. The obvious results of these two experiments, on the same dog, are,— 1st, The absorption of the greater part of the carbonic acid gas and the whole of the hydrogen introduced into the pleura, and the appearance, cle novo^ of a considerable quantity of azote ;—2nd, The death of the animal, in the space of five hours, from the time of admission of the nitrous gas and azote into the opposite pleura; the absorption of the greater part of the former gas, without inflammation of the membrane with which it was immediately in contact, and the production of a peculiar change in the blood. Results so singular required to be narrowly scruti- nized. I have twice repeated the experiment on the admission of hydrogen into the pleura of dogs, and in each instance, after death, 1 found that the hydro- s 2

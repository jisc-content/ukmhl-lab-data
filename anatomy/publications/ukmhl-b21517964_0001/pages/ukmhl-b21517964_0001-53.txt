ON THE TORPEDO. 33 trough, the shock of which I could just perceive at the extremities of my moistened fingers, was very distinct on the voluntary muscles of a live torpedo, just taken from the water; but it did not appear to affect in the least the electrical organs. I could not perceive the slightest contraction of them in what- ever manner the wires were applied, not even when a minute portion of integument was removed, or when one of the wires was placed in contact with a fasciculus of the electrical nerves. Even after ap- parent death, many of the parts decidedly muscular continued to contract under this stimulus, especially the muscles of the flank, and the cross muscles of - the inferior surface of the thorax, and the heart; in- deed this latter organ, two hours after it had been removed from the body, and had ceased to contract spontaneously, renewed its contractions under the galvanic influence. Other stimulants have been applied to the electri- cal organs, and with the same negative result. Even when punctured, or incised (a portion of their skin having been removed, which appears to be very sensitive) no indications whatever were witnessed of their substance being either sensitive or contrac- tile. Reflecting on the facts and observations which I have just detailed, it appears to me very difficult to resist the conclusion, that the electrical organs of the torpedo are not muscular, but columns formed of tendonous, or nervous fibres, distended by thin gela- D

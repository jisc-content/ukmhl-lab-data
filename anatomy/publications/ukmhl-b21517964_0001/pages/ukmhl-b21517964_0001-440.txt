420 DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING AND KEEPING sufficiently attended to ; I have known them neg- lected even by anatomists, not unaccomplished in the art of making preparations for the museum ; and I also know how difficult it is to have them observed by novices in the art, for whom chiefly these obser- vations are intended. Immediately after the thorough w^ashing, as soon as possible, if steeping be employed, the parts should be transferred from water to spirit. Before immer- sion in the latter, unless of peculiar delicacy they may be pressed gently, between folds of linen to re- move the excess of water. A mixture of seventy parts of proof spirit, and thirty of water (rain, or distilled water should be used*) is well adapted, even in warm climates, for preserving the majority of moist preparations. For the useful purposes of a museum, it is ne- cessary that the part to be kept should be, not only carefully and neatly dissected out, but also carefully, and neatly put up, and that immediately, and as it is intended it should appear on the shelf. If this be neglected at the moment, the season for doing it in perfection is lost. A preparation crammed into a bottle, just large enough to hold it, or thrown into spirits in a large vessel, as is too often done, without â€¢ If the water contain carbonate and sulphate of lime, which are of common occurrence in spring water, they will be precipitated by the spirits; the appearance of the preparation may thus be injured or the inside of the jar may become dull, and prevent a distinct view of the contents.

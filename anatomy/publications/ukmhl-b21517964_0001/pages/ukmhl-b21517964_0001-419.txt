ANIMAL MATTER IN DIFFERENT BONES. 399 The considerable proportion of animal matter which these bones contain, all but the last, is re- markably contrasted with the total or almost total want of it, in bones belonging to the most recent rock-formations. In the bone breccia of the Medi- terranean,—so widely scattered,—I have been able to detect a just perceptible trace only of animal matter: and in the teeth of the squali, which occur in the tertiary formations of Malta and Gozo, I have not been able to detect even a trace of it. In an enormous tooth"* of one of these fishes now in my possession,—I carefully sought for animal matter, but in vain. They and the fossil bones generally which have not been exposed to the air, owe their strength and hardness to a kind of cement of car- bonate of lime, which they all acquire. Judging analogically from the partial effect of a known period of time, what an idea of vast antiquity is conveyed by the circumstance of the total destruction of the animal matter of bones!—Perhaps, the instance of the Borrowstowmness bone, mentioned, in which the animal matter was only partially decomposed, may be considered as in opposition to the preceding re- mark. But it hardly can fairly be so considered, taking into account that it is probably human,—as its form indicates, and that the sandstone is pro- bably of very recent formation, and may be even still in progress. * It is 6^ inches long; 1 inch thick where of greatest thickness, and wide where of greatest width.

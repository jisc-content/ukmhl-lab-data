332 FLUID IN THE ing in two instances, viz. the 18th and 20th, no animalcules could be seen in the fluid expressed from the divided substance of the gland. The fluid, when it could be obtained in sufficient quantity for accurate observation, was transparent, generally con- tained globules nearly equal in diameter to the blood corpuscles, and invariably contained dense particles, apparently spherical, very much smaller, from twelve to fifteen times smaller, and which, it may be con- jectured, were the ova of the spermatic entozoa.* In the two instances in which spermatic animalcules were found in the fluid of the tubuli, the quantity of the fluid was greater than in the others.f What are the inferences to be drawn from the preceding observations in relation to the question * I am disposed to consider this as probable, partly in consequence of the peculiarity of appearance of the particles differing from any particles which I have hitherto seen in other parts of the body,—and partly from analogy. MM. Prevost and Dumas, from their very ex- tended and ingenious researches, have adopted a different conclusion, viz. that the spermatic entozoa are the result of secretion, and that the testes are the secreting organs;—a doctrine, perhaps, equally difficult to prove or disprove. The circumstance of the animalcules having been detected in the majority of the preceding cases in the vasa deferentia and vesiculae, when they could not he found in the testes, appears to me more in favour of their origin ex ova than by secretion. t Probably in health, these animalcules exist invariably in the testes of man contained in the tubuli. The results of the experiments of MM. Prevost and Dumas on twenty-five different species of verte- brate animals, may he adduced in support of this conclusion ; (Vide Ann. des Sciences Naturelles, vols. i. andii.) and I may add, that all the comparative trials I have yet made are in favour of it.

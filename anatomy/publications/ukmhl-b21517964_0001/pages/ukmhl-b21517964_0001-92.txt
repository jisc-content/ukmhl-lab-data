72 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS cious; yet it did not affect the galvanometer. Before it was quite dead, the abdomen was opened and the foetal fish were extracted. They were ten in number, all of them about the same size; in all of them, the outer yolk-bag had disappeared as represented in Plate VI. Touching them with the hand in the act of removing them from the uterine cavity, I received a distinct shock, sharp though not strong. Put into fresh sea-water as soon as thev were extracted, some of them immediately, and in a few seconds all of them, were active and swam about; and making trial of one of them instantly (the apparatus being in readiness) it powerfully affected the galvanometer and made a needle slightly magnetic. To ascertain the state of the internal yolk-vesicle, one of these fish was killed, by putting it into fresh water, about half an hour after its extraction. It immediately became very restless and endeavoured to escape; then in less than a minute it became quiet, and its water-valves ceased to act; two or three times at intervals it was again restless; in about twenty minutes it was motionless and dead. The appear- ance of its internal yolk-vesicle is represented in fig. 1. Plate VII. Three of these fish remained alive till 22d May in sea-water, which was changed daily or every second day ; of the others, one only died a natural death, the rest were killed at intervals, for the pur- pose of examining the size of the internal yolk- vesicle, which very slowly diminished during this

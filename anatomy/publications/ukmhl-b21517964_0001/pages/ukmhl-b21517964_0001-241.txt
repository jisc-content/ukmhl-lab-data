221 OF THE GENUS THYNNUS. parts adjoining. In point of magnitude, these respi- ratory nerves almost rival the electrical nerves of the torpedo, and their origin is very similar, and their direction and associations, but with this marked dif- ference between them, that the nerves of the Tor- pedo are entirely destitute of ganglia. The respiratory nerves of the other species of Thynnus which I have examined, very much resemble the preceding. Those which are smallest belong to the Thynnus brevipinnis ; and yet even in this fish, in comparison with fishes of other tribes, the respiratory nerves are large, and their ganglia considerable. This fish, perhaps, may be considered a link between the tunny family and the mackerel, on one side, and the pelamides, on the other; and the respiratory nerves of one of each of these genera which I have dissected, viz. of the Scomber pneumatophorus, and the Pelamys Sarda, have approached in magnitude those of the Thynnus last mentioned. What the temperature of these fish is, I have not had an opportunity of determining by trial; according to the statement of the fishermen I have consulted, they are cold-blooded. Reasoning from analogy, it may be conjectured that they will be found to be of some- what higher temperature than other fishes less amply supplied with respiratory nerves. As regards the rationale of the high temperature of the species of Thynnus, there appears to me less difficulty than in accounting for the electrical power exercised by the torpedo and gymnotus. The peculiar

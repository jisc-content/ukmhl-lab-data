4IG DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING AND KEEPING scurity, confusion, and error are avoided ; the pur- suit loses as much as possible its disgusting aspect; it gives information of a satisfactory kind ; excites interest powerfully ; and zealously pursued becomes almost fascinating. Farther, when the dissection is conducted on these principles, it is the source of much valuable instruction. It makes the hand dex- terous for surgical operations ; it produces caution in deciding on post mortem appearances, which are so often deceptive; and habituates the eye to the nice discrimination of what is sound in structure, and what is diseased. When any morbid appearance presents itself, the part displaying it should be carefully examined before it is removed ; its situation should be noticed, and its connections traced. If it is considered worthy of being preserved, wdth that intention, it should be dissected out so as to appear to the best advantage; to require as little explanation as possi- ble ; and to be by itself as intelligible as possible. If dissected out neatly and cleanly at once, free from extraneous, adipose, cellular, and muscular substance, &c. much subsequent trouble will be spared, and time saved.

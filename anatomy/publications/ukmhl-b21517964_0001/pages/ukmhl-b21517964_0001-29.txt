9 ON THE TORPEDO. and was felt with the same degree of force in both hands. This seems to shew that the air is not im- permeable to the electricity of the torpedo; and the same conclusion may perhaps be drawn from the facility with which I have found it to pass through a circuit of wire in which there have been no less than seven joinings, and those made merely with ordinary care with the fingers, without the aid of any instrument. In accordance with Mr. Walsh and my brother, I have in no instance seen the torpedo affect the electrometer, or exhibit any the slightest indication of a power of attraction and repulsion in air. It having been stated on high authority that a spark has been obtained from the gymnotus electricus,* I thought it right, after obtaining the preceding results which were detailed in my first paper,—to renew the attempts to procure a spark from the torpedo. I have tried the method, which, it is said, succeeded with Mr. Walsh in the in- stance of the gymnotus, namely, dividing with a penknife gold leaf attached to glass, and connecting the divided parts with the contact wires. Using an active fish, in this way, I could neither observe a * Mr. Walsh is said to have written to M. Le Roi to the above effect; and also that Sir John Pringle and M. Magellan assured M. Le Roi they had witnessed the result repeatedly. Vide Bloch’s Ichthyologie, p. 1020. Bloch refers for his information to Rozier’s Journal, Ann. 1774. M. De Humboldt (Annales de Chimie et de Physique, tom. xi. 427,) states that the same result has been observed ,by M. Fahlberg. He refers to Vetensk Acad. ny. quart. 2. (1801).

PNEUMATHORAX. 265 ments seem to shew that the pleura is possessed of a similar power in respect to absorpton, and that in exerting this power, like the skin, it acts with greater energy and effect on one gas than on another. Whe- ther the analogy will hold good as regards exhalation also, must be decided by future inquiry.* Reflecting on the preceding experiments on the absorption of different kinds of air introduced into the pleura, it appeared probable that mucous membrane, like serous membrane and the skin, may possess the power of absorbing air. In relation to this view, I thought it worth while to examine the air contained in the antrum maxillare, and in the frontal sinus. I chose for the experiment the head of the sheep, in which these cavities are large, the openings by which they communicate with the atmosphere, small, and the membrane by which they are covered, an active secreting surface. I collected the air by perforating the cavities underwater, about fifteen minutes after the death of the animal. In two different instances, the results of the examination of the air were the follow- • When the experiments were made, which are detailed in the preceding pages, I was not acquainted with the ingenious and elabo- rate researches of M. Nysten on the injection of ditferent kinds of gas into the blood-vessels and into the pleura, as described in his excellent work, “ Recherches de Physiologie et de Chimie Patho- logiques,” published in 1817. The results I have obtained in most respects agree with his. Had he examined the residual air, and ascertained its composition, after the death of the animal experi- mented upon, the value of his researches, great as it is already, would have been much enhanced.

33(i FLUID IN THE answered, and in most instances, as it appears to me, in a satisfactory manner, but without reference to microscopical research.* Admitting the fact, that the vesiculse are, like the gall-bladder and bladder of urine, recipients, it may he viewed as a fortunate circumstance in our economy, and admirably adapted to the condition of man. Like the bile or the urine, so the spermatic fluid in the healthy adult appears to be in constant process of secretion, and to pass as it is formed into its appropriate reservoir, from whence, without dis- turbance of the system, in a state of continence, it is either pressed out and voided during the act of alvine evacuation, or it may be in part absorbed. Mr. Hunter, in accordance with the opinion which he had formed of the use of the vesiculae, did not admit this. He believed that the fluid rather accu- mulated in the testes, and gave rise there to annoy- ance, requiring its evacuation by a disturbing act, a doctrine of some danger, especially to youth, in its consequences. In confirmation of what is stated above, and in opposition to the doctrine of Hunter, I may farther state, that I have frequently examined microscopically the fluid from the urethra following the alvine evacuation, and I have always found it, from a healthy person, abounding in animalcules. * Manuel dâ€™Anatomic G^nerale, Descriptive et Pathologique.

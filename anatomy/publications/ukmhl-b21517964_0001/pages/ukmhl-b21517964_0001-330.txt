310 PECULIARITY OF STRUCTURE OCCURRING Of the four instances of ulceration of the larynx unaccompanied by tubercles, the first, was compli- cated with empyema and purulent effusion into the pericardium to the extent of three pounds and a half; the second was associated with melanotic tubercles in the lungs; and the third and fourth were con- nected with small-pox. All the instances of pneumathorax, with the ex- ception of one, occurred in cases of tubercular phthisis, and originated in a communication of a valvular kind being established between the pleura, and a bronchial tube by ulceration, commonly through the medium of a cavity. In the one exception, a similar communication was detected, the consequence of a partial destruction of lung, from an abscess in the liver penetrating and bursting into the lung through the diaphragm. Of the large number of examples of aperture in the fossa ovalis, all were oblique, with the exception of three. Of the three direct, one was sufficiently large to admit the fore-finger, and two to admit the end of the little finger. In neither instance was there the slightest appearance of the morbus cseru- leus. The subject of the first-mentioned and most remarkable example was an old soldier, who for many years enjoyed excellent health. In these cases, it appears inevitable that there must have been an admixture of venous and arterial blood in the auri- cles. In the examples of the oblique passage, the probability is, that no blood flowed from one auricle

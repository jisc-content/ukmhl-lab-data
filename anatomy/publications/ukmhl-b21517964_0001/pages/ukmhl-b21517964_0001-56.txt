3(i EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS ing, which there is reason to consider as the cavity of the organ of hearing, and the medullary matter the nerve of hearing. After this, in passing out- wards, it divides into three small branches, and two large ones. Of the former, one proceeds to the gills, another to the adjoining muscles, and the third to the mouth. Of the great branches, one ascends, and sweeping round the margin of the electrical organ, is distributed to the mucous glands which abound there, and where some of its twigs inoscu- late with twigs of the former nerve. The other great branch, which is inferior, enters the electrical organ, and ramifies through its superior portion. The next pair of nerves, the second electrical, rises a little beyond the preceding. On leaving the cranium, it divides into two great branches; these, with the ex- ception of nervous twigs supplying the adjoining branchiae, are distributed entirely in the substance of the electrical organ, and ramify in all directions through its middle portion. The third electrical rises close to the last, divided only by a very thin plate of cartilage. The principal portion of it passes into the electrical organ, and ramifies through its inferior part. Besides, it gives off three small branches, which are sent to the adjoining branchiae, to the gullet and stomach, and to the tail. The branch which supplies the stomach appears to be the principal nerve of this organ; it descends along the inner and inferior portion of the gullet, and ramifies in the direction of the great arch of the

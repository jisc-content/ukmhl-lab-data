HUMAN BODY AFTER DEATH. 237 will probably be considered of very unequal interest, comparing those in which an unusually high tempe- rature was noticed, with the majority in which the temperature was no higher than might have been expected. It would be superfluous on this occasion to enter into any minute disquisition relative to the rationale of the very high temperature observed in the bodies Nos. 1 and 2, in relation to the different degrees of temperature noticed in the other bodies. The ques- tion will naturally be asked. Was the extraordinary temperature in one case, of 113째, and in the other of 108째, generated during life or after death ? I have little hesitation in coming to the conclusion, that it was generated before death, and generated probably in the same way as the ordinary degree of animal heat experienced in health, or the extraordinary degree witnessed in febrile diseases. A priori^ the effect of the heat-generating process, whatever it may be, can hardly be limited. In many birds, it raises the tem- perature of the body to 109째, when in perfect health, and in man to 101째, at least in the tropics, without deranging health; and it is easy to conceive, that, by increased activity or energy, it may exalt the tem- perature to the common febrile height, or to a height greatly exceeding that. But, destitute of life, there does not appear to be in the body any source of heat, any power of generating it, that we are aware of. Putrefaction had not taken place in these bodies ; I believe I may say it had hardly obscurely com-

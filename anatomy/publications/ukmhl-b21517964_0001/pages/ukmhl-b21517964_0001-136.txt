EFFECTS OF THE POISON OF IKi appearance. The brain exhibited no marks of disease. Both ventricles of the heart were empty, contracted and hard ; the auricles contained coagu- lated blood. The lungs were unusually red, and the air-cells were full of serum, which, on pressure, flowed out copiously. Experiment 2.—Three days after, a powerful cock was exposed to the same snake. The snake fastened on his comb, and kept its hold with its fangs for one or two seconds. A little blood flowed from the wound. During the first four hours, the bird did not ap- pear in the least unwell, walking about and eating as usual. After the fourth hour he began to droop and lose his strength : in eight hours he appeared very weak, could scarcely walk; his feathers were ruffled ; his eyes nearly closed; his breathing labo- rious. In this state he continued about twenty-four hours without eating: he voided much green ex- crement. His temperature was reduced from 109’75, which it was before he was bitten, to 106°. About the twenty-eighth hour, he appeared a little better, but still refused to eat: this was in the evening ; the next morning (he was in my bed-room in a large basket) I was awakened by his loud and vigorous crowing. He now appeared recovered; he had regained his appetite, and his temperature had risen to 108°.

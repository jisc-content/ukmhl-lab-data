46 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS of air, and its want of the powder of attraction and repulsion in the air. These peculiarities are seemingly in favour of the second opinion, that the electricity of the torpedo is specific and peculiar. But till the opposite surfaces of the electrical organs can be perfectly insulated, so that no easier mode of communication is afforded than through air, they can hardly be considered of much weight.* The third opinion may be indulged in as an hypo- thesis ; as a guide to research it may not be useless. It applies, however, almost as much to other varie- ties of electricity as to that of the torpedo; all of which, it is possible, may be compounded, or owe their various effects to the union of several powers, or ethereal fluids, and their peculiarities compared one with another, to the predominance in various degrees of these fluids. What is known of the solar ray is not unfavourable to such an opinion; and the history of physical science, in relation to elementary ponder- able matter, may give rather encouragement to the notion. As regards the mode of production, or the cause of the electricity of the torpedo, it is unavoidably enveloped in great mystery. Like animal heat, and the light emitted by certain animals, and I may add, * In the experiments in which I attempted to insulate the surfaces, by means of oil, the probability is, that I failed, and that a commu- nication continued, if not by the outer surface of the skin, at least by its inner; indeed, the attempts to insulate these organs, in the man- ner desired, seems to be almost hopeless.

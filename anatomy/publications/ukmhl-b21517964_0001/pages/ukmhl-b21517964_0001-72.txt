52 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS spinal cord. This was the result of Hunter’s dis- section : he says, “ the organ is supplied with nerves from the medulla spinalis, from which they come out in pairs between all the vertebrae of the spine.” In the silurus electricus, according to the re- searches of Rudolphi, they appear to have a double source: those supplying the outer organ being de- rived from the fifth pair; those supplying the inner, from the intercostal. Moreover, a marked difference appears in the pro- portional magnitude of the nerves in the several in- stances. In the torpedo they appear to be largest; in the silurus smallest. Hunter says, “ if all the nerves which go to it (the electrical organ of the torpedo) were united together, they would make a vastly greater chord, than all those which go to the organs of this eel,” (the electrical gymnotus.)* Their comparative smallness in the silurus, I have satisfied myself of by my own observations, made on a speci- men, which through the kindness of the American consul at Malta, I procured from Egypt, and which is now deposited in the museum at Fort Pitt. As regards electrical power, it is commonly believed, that it does not accord with the propor- tion of nerve; that it is feebler in the torpedo than in the silurus, and greatest in the gymnotus. In relation to the shock or sensation which these fishes impart, the opinion probably is true. What * Philosophical Transactions for 1775.

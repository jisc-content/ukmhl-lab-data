OF THE HEART AND AORTA. ‘139 in either of the cavities of the heart. Both ventri- cles were firmly contracted ; and the valves of the aorta and pulmonary artery were unusually large and perfect. The aorta was carefully examined throughout its course; excepting two or three opaque spots on its inner membrane, without sensi- ble thickening, it exhibited no signs of disease, and appeared to be of usual firmness. Where the vessel was ruptured, in each place the coats seemed sound; nor did the ruptured auricle exhibit any in- dications of organic disease. The lungs were free, and crepitous; their substance was redder than usual, and contained more blood than usual. The trachea and bronchia were bright red internally, and coated with blood, probably owing to hemorrhage from the lungs. Nothing abnormal was found in the cavity of the abdomen; neither the spleen nor liver, (of all the viscera most liable to laceration from falls) was appreciably injured. Both the stomach and bladder were found moderately dis- tended, one with yellowish chyme, which had no smell of spirits,—the other with pale urine. According to the report of those who discovered the body, and of those who saw it before it was moved, it lay on its back, — the feet nearest the precipice, in a diagonal position. The limbs, it is said, were rigid and every part of the body cold, ex- cepting the left side of the chest which was pretty warm. No part of the dress was torn. The ground was firm, bare chalk.

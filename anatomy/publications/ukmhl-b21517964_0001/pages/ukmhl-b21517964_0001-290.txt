TWO CASES OF 270 Conceiving that the operation had failed in con- sequence of adhesions in the part of the pleura punctured; and encouraged by the composition of the air collected, and the slight relief which the patient experienced, a repetition of the operation was decided on, and performed the next day. The chest now was perforated, just below the left papilla. On withdrawing the stilette into the bladder, a large quantity of air rushed out and dis- tended the bladder; and on separating the bladder from the cannula (by cutting it off, after having secured the air in the former by a tight ligature) air from the chest, for several seconds continued to rush out with violence. When the rush of air had ceased, and it was found that air began to pass in on inspiration, the cannula was withdrawn, and the wound was closed by adhesive plaster. The patient experienced sudden and great relief, exceeding his power to express.* For about a month after the operation, the patient continued progressively to improve. On the 17th of June, he was as well, as when first admitted into hospital. His appetite was good, and his cough little troublesome. He could lie on the left side, which he was unable to do many months prior to the operation. Both wounds were healed. The * The air collected in the bladder amounted to 25 cubic inches. Examined by means of lime-water and phosphorus, it was found to consist of 93 azote, and 7 carbonic^ acid; it had no offensive odour, or odour of any kind.

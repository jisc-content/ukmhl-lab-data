IN WINTER AND IN SUMMER. 213 Near surface of cerebrum - 103° Interior of globe of eye - - 100° 2.—Rectum - - 105° Vagina (mucous fluid flowing from it period of aestus) - - 107° Blood from jugular vein - - 106° “ carotid artery - - 107° Base of brain - - 106° Near surface of cerebrum - - 105° Right ventricle - o o 1 Left ventricle - - 108° Interior of globe of eye - - 104° It was my wish to have examined the heart whilst yet pulsating, to endeavour to ascertain if any heat is produced by the muscular contraction of the organ. The chest was opened within five minutes of the division of the great vessels of the neck ; but in both instances too late, the heart had ceased to contract. The second sheep was in an irritable state ; the lungs abounded in granular tubercles, yet the ani- mal was in excellent condition.* The next observations were made on the l6th of March, when the temperature of the air was 51°. * The prevalency of tubercles in the lungs of sheep is rcmarhable. In their granular state, they do not appear to affect materially the health or condition of the animal; even a few small vomicee seem to have very little effect. I believe it is precisely the same with the human species; many facts which I have collected are in accordance with it. The analogy is instructive and well deserving of being kept in mind.

3G5 ACID TO ANATOMICAL PURPOSES. As the jejunum passes into the ileum, and as the ileum descends, another change takes place, and it is ver}^ strongly marked close to the termination of the latter intestine, where the mucous coat is truly villous;—so it appears to the naked eye in sulphu- rous acid; and, when examined in a favourable light with a lens, the villi exhibit the appearance of tu- bular projections rounded at the ends ; and some of them have a form approaching to the conical, rather than the cylindrical. The sulphurous acid makes the glandular structure* of the lower part of the ileum very distinct to the naked eye. This villous structure terminates suddenly at the valve of the colon (where the valve begins), and a new kind of structure succeeds it in the valve, and proceeds, with very little variation, of the same kind throughout the large intestines, even to their termi- nation, not excepting the appendicula vermiformis. Its resembles honey-comb in its appearance, more than any thing else to which I can compare it; but it is so very minute and delicate in every part of the large intestines, that it cannot be well distinguished, excepting with the aid of a magnifying glass. The glands, on the contrary, of the large intestines, ap- pear very distinct in the sulphurous acid; and their orifices are easily seen. * Glandulse aggregatse; Peyer’s glands, not discovered but mi nutely described by him in 1677.

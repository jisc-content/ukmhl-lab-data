PNEUMATHORAX. *275 part of the oesophagus was similar. The pericardium was firmly attached to the middle lobe of the right lung by a firm adventitious band. On exposing to view the left cavity of the chest, the inside of the pleura exhibited a surface of milk-white granular coagulable lymph, about two lines thick, equally diffused on the costal and the pulmonic side. Ex- cepting the cicatrices externally in the skin, no traces could be detected of the first two operations, nor was there any mark of the last operation, exclusive of the small opening that had been carefully kept open, just large enough to admit the trochar, which had been daily introduced to draw off the fluid and allow the air to escape. On maceration of the rib, it may be remarked, a very narrow ring of bone was found exfoliating from the perforated part. The left lung was very much condensed, and so firmly confined by its thickened pleura, that it did not dilate when air was driven into it with some force by a double bellows attached to the trachea. This experiment was made with the lung under water, for the purpose of ascertaining, if any, and what kind, of communi- cation, existed between the lung and the pleura, with a view to discover the origin of the air accumulated in this cavity. Two communications were thus detected; one in the inferior, the other in the supe- rior lobe: the former was so exceedingly small that it could not be traced. The latter opening was sufficiently large to admit a surgeon’s probe,—and its course was easily followed. It was found to T 2

ANATOMICAL PREPARATIONS IN HOT CLIMATES. 4l7 the diseased part are forgotten ; after a time it ceases to excite interest, as a confused mass putre- fying, or bordering on putrefaction, it is a loathsome and worthless object; and thus in consequence of not having been finished at once, it ends in being thrown away ; and an aversion too often is acquired, rather than a fondness for pathological anatomy. The present remarks are applicable to all kinds of anatomical preparations, but more especially those intended to be kept in spirit of wine, which experi- ence has proved is better adapted for the preser- vation of moist preparations than any other liquid yet tried. The methods of proceeding in preserving pre- parations, must to a certain extent be modified according to the nature of the morbid parts, and agreeably to the intention of the anatomist. If the diseased part is small, and it is wished to preserve its colour, as a portion of inflamed, or of ulcerated stomach or intestine, it should be immersed immediately in strong spirit; and instantly put up, as it is intended it should remain. After a month the spirit may be changed for fresh spirit, and the mouth of the vessel should be firmly secured. The blood in the part will thus be coagulated and pre- served ; the shape will be retained without unseemly distortions, which when once rigid are not easily removed ; and the preparation is fit for the shelf of the museum without any further trouble.

EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 2 Ro7ne, Feb. 25th, 1829. “ My dear John, “ If I had not liad this attack, it was my inten- tion to have gone to Fumicina, or Civita Veccliia, to make some experiments on the torpedo. I hope you will take up this subject, which, both as a com- parative anatomist and chemist, you are very capable to elucidate. You will see my paper on the torpedo, in the manuscript book which I have left in Mr. Tobin’s hands.* It was my wish to have exposed an unmagnetised needle to the con- tinued shocks of a torpedo in a metallic spiral, making the metallic communication perfect with both electrical organs. There is in my little box, an apparatus which I hope you will use. Large living torpedos may be procured at Fumicina, or Civita Vecchia. The shock from a very small jar will make a needle magnetic, provided it is entirely passed through the metallic conductors; but I did not find this effect when there was any interruption by water. There are many things worth attending to in the two kinds of torpedinal fishes found here— the tremula and occhiatella. Pray do not neglect this subject, which I leave to you as another legacy. God bless you, my dear brother, your affectionate Friend, “H. Davy.” * This, his last paper and communication to the Royal Society, was published in the Philosophical Transactions, for 1829; it was written in the preceding October; its results were entirely negative.

293 ON THE SKIN. Lastly^—Of the consequences of the Discoloratio7i of the Skin. Sir Everard Home, in an interesting paper pub- lished in the Philosophical Transactions for 1821, has proved, that, when the skin is painted black, it is defended from the scorching effect of the sun’s rays; and, he thence infers, that the dark rete mucosum of the Negro possesses the same protect- ing power. I have made experiments similar to those of Sir Everard Home, and have modified them, and all of them with the same results. All the opaque colours of which I made trial, applied to the skin, whether red, orange, blue, or green, have afforded protec- tion from the scorching influence of the sun’s rays, equal to that afforded by black.* But though I have confirmed the experimental results of Sir Everard Home, it appeared to me, when reflecting on the subject, that his inference was not so well established as at first view might be conceived. It is founded on analogy, and that ana- logy not perfect; there being this difference between the skin of a white person painted, and of a negro with a black skin; that, in the one instance, the * Considering the effect mentioned above, the usage of the ancient Britons of painting their bodies, may be referred to a purpose of utility, as well as of barbarous ornament,—the paint, with which they bedaubed themselves, must have answered, in part, in place of clothing.

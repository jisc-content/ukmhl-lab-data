3(i8 ON THE APPLICATION OF SULPHUROUS superficially through this sheath, now rendered trans- parent ; and sections, in difierent directions of the organ, display equally clearly its internal structure, which, to the eye, either naked or assisted by glasses of difierent powers, ap})ears to be distinctly cellular, analogous to the substance of the lungs; or, per- haps, still more analogous in appearance to the structure of the common sponge, especially the anterior part of the corpora cavernosa, where the cells irregularly formed are largest, and where, as in a cut piece of common sponge, there are large cir- cular orifices, which seem to belong to canals formed of ligamentous substance, which penetrate a certain way, and terminate abruptly with closed extremities.* From such trials as I have yet made of the effects of sulphurous acid on the textures of other animals besides those of man, I am of opinion that it may be usefully employed in comparative anatomy, espe- cially to aid in the display of minute structure. For this purpose, inquirers will find it very serviceable, in the instances of preparations sent from abroad unskilfully put up, or in examining the viscera of animals which have been obtained entire, preserved in spirits. The effect of the acid in dilating the contracted parts, especially those which are mem- branous and cellular, as the primae viae, and the air passages and lungs, exceeds expectation. If the parts are delicate, I should mention by way of pre- â€¢ These, probably are the arteriee helicinBe of Professor Muller.

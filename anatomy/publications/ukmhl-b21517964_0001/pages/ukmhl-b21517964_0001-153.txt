In the mean time, I may remark, that fortunately for man, in this great obscurity, the immediate treatment of all poisoned wounds, merely locally considered, is simple and very similar. The ob- vious indications are, to extract the poison as much as possible, and as speedily as possible; and to endeavour to prevent its entering the circulation. The first indication is best accomplished by cutting out the part bitten, and scarifying the surrounding integument. If the person bitten want courage to do this, he should suck the wound well, and after- wards apply caustic, if at hand. The second indi- cation may be tolerably fulfilled (if the part bitten admit of the application of a ligature) by tying a handkerchief very tightly just above the wound. Respecting the employment of oil, arsenic and eau de luce, having no experience of their effects. * It is the opinion of the natives that these stones are found in the brain of snakes. From Sir Alexander Johnson, to whom I wfvs indebted for the specimens I examined, I learnt that those of the first kind are manufactured by the monks of Manilla, who carry on a lucrative trade in them with the merchants of India.

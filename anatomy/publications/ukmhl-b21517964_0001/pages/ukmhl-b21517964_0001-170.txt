150 ACCOUNT OF EXPERIMENTS To describe all the experiments that I have made to ascertain the temperature of different parts of the animal body, appears superfluous, especially as the comparative results were very similar. It will be sufficient therefore here to notice the observations made on the human body, and on that of a lamb. That the thermometer might be equally applied to all parts of the surface, its bulb, in form nearly cylindrical, was fixed to a small piece of cork, hol- lowed and lined with fine wool, and thus half its superficies was applied in each instance. The ob- servations were made on the naked body at seven A.M. immediately after quitting bed. The tem- perature of the air of the room was 70°. The following were the results obtained. At the central part of the sole of the foot 90° Between the malleolus internus, and the insertion of the tendo achillis, where the artery is felt - - 93° Over the middle of the tibia - - 91-5 Over the middle of the calf - - 93° Over the popliteal artery at the bend of the knee - - . . _ 95° left side of the heart, not having been acted on by air,—and there ha\dng been no production of heat, would necessarily resemble venous blood, in temperature as well as in colour. In this point of view the results of the experiments referred to above, may be con- sidered confirmatory of the hypothesis in which the lungs are held to be the chief seat of the heating process.

The proportional size of the kidneys of snakes is greatest, that of the lizards next, and that of the turtle and tortoise least. As is well known, these latter animals differ from the former, in having a urinary bladder. The large green turtle of Ceylon has a pear-shaped urinary bladder, not unlike that of some of the mammalia, communicating with the cloaca by a long dilatable neck, or, as it may be considered, urethra, in which, nearer its termination in the intestine than its origin, the ureters open by two large prominent papillae. The Testudo greeca has a large bladder, much resembling that of the toad, of the like delicate structure, and divided into two compartments posteriorly; but, similar to the turtle, in its communication with the cloaca and the termination of the ureters, with this slight difference, however, that they are still more distant from the bladder, opening close to the extremity of the urethra. In the bladder, both of the turtle and tortoise of Ceylon, I found flakes of pure lithic acid ; but in no great abundance: they were suspended in a trans- parent watery fluid, containing a little mucus and common salt, but no urea, or any other substance, which I could detect in the small quantity the sub- ject of experiment. The urinary bladder of the Testudo graeca was in a state of distension. Its contents were found to consist of lithic acid and lithate of ammonia, partly H 2

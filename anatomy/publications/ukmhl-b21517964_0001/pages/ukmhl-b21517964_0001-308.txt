288 EFFECTS OF THE SUNâ€™s RAYS ving the effects of blisters on parts of the skin in which there have been moles; on the areola of the mammilla; and on the skin of the Negro. In all these examples, the effects generally are very similar. If the blister is mild, the cuticle is simply raised ; in the instance of the Negro, with a very little colouring matter adhering to it. When severe and long continued, not only is the cuticle raised by serum effused, but also by coagulable lymph, to which is attached colouring matter, and which may easily be mistaken for a coloured rete mucosum, and which is easily separated as a continuous mem- brane. When severe inflammation and suppuration is excited, the colouring matter either comes away spontaneously, or is most easily detached.* It appears to be most firmly connected with the cutis in the instance of moles, next in that of the brown areola of the nipple, and least in that of the black skin of the Negro. The part, in healing, when covered with the first formed cuticle, is red ; it soon becomes brownish, but a considerable time elapses before it acquires its former intensity of colour. In the instance of the Negro, in which I have watched its progress, the secretion of colouring matter began at the edges, and spread towards the centre; and then, after a few days, spots of black appeared in the middle, which enlarged till the whole area was * Thus it may be obtained in large pieces, very much resembling a membrane; but the connecting medium, I suspect, is coagulable lymph.

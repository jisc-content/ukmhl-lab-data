HEART AND GREAT VESSELS. 453 Considering them generally, they are, perhaps, less uniform than might have been expected; and hardly favourable to any general conclusions being deduced from them, excepting, indeed, the follow- ing:—1st, That the power of resistance possessed by the heart and large vessels, independent of any vital properties of endurance peculiar to them, is enormous; * and, 2ndly, that there is much varia- tion in point of strength in the same parts in dif- ferent instances. I have alluded to the rareness of the accident, which induced me to institute these trials. Refer- ring to authors, I can find only one clear instance on record of a similar kind, that is, of rupture of any part of the heart, from a force acting through the medium of other parts, on this organ, apparently free from disease and in its perfectly normal healthy state. The case is noticed by Portal, in his Anatomie Medicale; * it was of a young man, over part of whose chest, the wheel of a cart loaded with stones * Vide Hale’s Haemastatics.—The results of his experiments on the above point are very striking. Referring to them, he says,— “We see in these instances, the great strength of the coats of these vessels; what great reason have we, therefore, with thankful hearts to say to our Creator, as holy Job did, when he contemplated on the wonderful frame and strength of his body, Job x. 11, Thou hast not only fenced me with bones and sinews, but hast also effectually secured the vital fluid in such strongly wrought channels as are proof against its most lively and vigorous sallies, when either agi- tated by the different passions, or by strong and brisk actions of the body.”—Op.

ON THE TORPEDO. 61 I may remark generally that I have never found in any of the gravid torpedos which I have ex- amined in different stages, any membrane investing the foetus, as is the case with the foetus of some of the squali.* Neither have I found any fluid in the uterine cavity, at any period excepting that already mentioned.f * The foetus of squalus acanthias at a very early period is con- tained in a delicate membrane, which at a more advanced period, near the full time, disappears. The foetus of the squalus squatina seems to be analogous to that of the torpedo, without a membrane; that of the squalus galeus has a membrane even in its advanced stage, appearing to be, as it were, a link between the torpedo and the oviparous rays, whose eggs, enclosed in a thick strong horny shell, (mus marinus, pulvinar marinum of the older naturalists) are hatched out of the body. t I have in vain sought in the uterine cavity of the torpedo for lithic acid, which is so abundantly secreted by the kidneys of the chick in ovo; nor have I succeeded in detecting urea in the fluid it contains, a substance which I have found in a notable quantity in the fluid of the uterine cavity of the squalus squatina, and in abun- dance in the liquor amnii of the dog about the fifth week of preg- nancy ; and have also detected in the human liquor amnii at the full period. In the cloaca of very young torpedos, I have sometimes seen a transparent fluid, probably urine, but in too small quantities for examination. The nature of the urinary secretion of the adult torpedo, I have not yet been able to ascertain. I suspect that it is liquid, and that it is voided almost as rapidly as it is secreted—the fish being without a urinary bladder, and its cloaca of narrow di- mensions. Hitherto I have had few opportunities of examining the secre- tion of the kidneys of fishes, a subject which, I believe, has not yet been at all investigated, although in many respects interesting. Referring to my notes, I find, that in the instance of a fish, belonging to Cuvier’s Third Order, “ les Plectognathes,” occasion- ally caught off" the south-west coast of Ceylon, I detected, in 1819,

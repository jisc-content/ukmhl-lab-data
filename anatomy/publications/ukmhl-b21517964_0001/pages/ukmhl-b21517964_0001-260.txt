TEMPERATURE OF THE 240 Additional Observations on the Temperature of the Body after Death. The subject discloses, besides what have already been adverted to, other openings for curious and perhaps useful inquiry, especially in medical juris- prudence. It may often be a question, how long a body has been dead. By attention to its temperature, parti- cularly of the deep-seated parts, taking into con- sideration the circumstances affecting temperature, probably, in most instances, an answer may be given, approximating to the truth, and which may prove of considerable use in evidence. As the preceding observations were all made in a comparatively warm climate, — it appeared to me desirable to extend them in this country,—parti- cularly in relation to the application above men- tioned. I shall now detail, such additional ones as I have had an opportunity of collecting, all of which have been made during the year 1838, in the General Hospital, at Fort Pitt, Chatham, on sub- jects similar to those on which the trials w^ere in- stituted at Malta—being all soldiers. It may fur- ther be premised, that immediately after decease, the bodies were removed from the wards, and were kept in a room, covered merely with a sheet, in which the temperature was seldom more than 4° or 5° above that of the open air. 1.—Aged 26; died of pulmonary consumption

ON THE TORPEDO. 41 brought very close to each other, one being kept as before, and the other moved immediately over it, in front, each about a quarter of an inch from the margin, and not connected with the electrical organs, except by the common integuments and this mucous apparatus. It is worthy of remark that this little space in front, intermediate between the two electri" cal organs, so abounding in glandular structure, and so amply provided with nerves, appears from experi- ments to possess very little sensibility. This was denoted in these trials, in which the fish, though exquisitely sensible of pressure on the margin of the pectoral fins, seemed indifferent to it when applied in front, as if the fourth pair, which supplies this part, were destined rather for secretion than for the purpose of sensation. The connexion between the electrical nerves, and the mucous system, even more remarkable than between the former and the stomach, may perhaps warrant the conjecture that the electrical function may not only be aided by, but also aid the secretion of mucus; and that, as was sup- posed in regard to the stomach, when the elec- tricity is not employed, in repelling an enemy, in violent efforts, it may be exercised gently in in- creasing the activity of these glands. In support of this notion it may be mentioned, that in the fishes which I have kept, in which digestion was arrested, the secretion also of mucus appeared to be stopped, or considerably diminished.

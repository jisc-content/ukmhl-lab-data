TWO CASES OF 254 11 ounces in quantity, half an ounce of the de- canted water having yielded, when evaporated, 2*2 grains of dry residue. The air collected from the pleura, had not the least fetor, nor indeed any smell. It extinguished flame, and was not inflammable. Examined by means of lime-water and phosphorus, (which was sublimed in it without effect) 100 parts of it, were found to consist of 8 carbonic acid gas, and 92 azotic gas. Whence this air was derived became a question for consideration. Reflecting on the communica- tion, discovered by dissection, between the pleura and the atmosphere through the medium of the lung, it seemed almost demonstrated, that the air was atmospheric air altered. The next question was, how the alteration had taken place ; what had become of the oxygen which had disappeared; whence the carbonic acid gas with which the azote was mixed ? To endeavour to learn how the oxygen had dis- appeared, the following experiment was instituted. The right pleura of a dog was inflated with at- mospheric air, by means of a double bellows, and the incision through which the air was introduced was closed by a suture. At the end of forty-eight hours, the dog was killed. An hour after death, the pleura was punctured under water, and about 8 cubic inches of air were collected. This air, examined by means of lime-water and phosphorus,

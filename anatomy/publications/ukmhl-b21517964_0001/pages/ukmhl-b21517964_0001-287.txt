Magendie and Chevreul, on the composition of the air contained in the human stomach and intestines ;* and very recently I have met with a fact, the bearing of which, appears to me similar. In examining the body of a soldier, who had died of complicated disease, I found the coecum exceedingly distended with air, and of a bright red colour, as if highly inflamed, whilst the ascending colon was unusually contracted. The air collected under water amounted to thirty-six cubic inches, and consisted of 11 car- bonic acid, or air absorbable by lime-water, and of 89 chiefly azote, judging from its extinguishing flame, and not being itself inflammable. I had not the means of ascertaining if any traces of carburetted hydrogen were present. The question, whether mucous membranes are capable of absorbing gases, I need not say, is one of great importance in relation to the theory of respiration, and on that account deserving of par- ticular attention. The theory which in 1823 was most generally adopted, is recommended by its simplicity, but is not well supported by the analogies and facts of physiology, which seem to favour the doctrine of the absorption of oxygen into the blood, and the evolution of carbonic acid; and that perhaps, not in the air-cells of the lungs alone, but likewise * Ann. cle Chem. and Pliys. ii. 292.

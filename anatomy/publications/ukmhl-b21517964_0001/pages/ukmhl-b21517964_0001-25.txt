5 ON THE TORPEDO. tended to be applied to the under surftice of the fish was one-twenty-fifth of an inch in diameter; that in- tended for the upper surface was stiffer, being one- fourteenth of an inch in diameter, and its greater strength was useful, as it was necessary to employ it occasionally with some force to rouse the fish when averse to give a shock. The first trial I had an opportunity of making with this apparatus, was suc- cessful. It was on the 3rd of Sept. 1831, at eleven o’clock at night.* The fish used was a small one, about six inches long; it had been just caught in a hand-net, and immediately put into salt water, and was very active. A needle perfectly free from mag- netism, was introduced into the spiral, and there confined by the corks, and the spiral was carefully connected with the insulated wires for contact. The fish for the experiment was placed in a glass basin, and was barely covered with water. One wire was applied to the under surface of the electrical organ, and the other to its upper surface, and contacts were made at intervals during about five minutes, when the fish seemed much exhausted by its exertions. On taking the needle out, and bringing it near some fine iron filings, it w’as found to be magnetic, and * It may appear singular that this experiment was not made before. The explanation is easily made.—On my return from Rome to Malta, in June, 1829, I was assured that the torpedo is not known in the latter place. It w^as not until the summer of 1831 that I found out that I had been misinformed, and that, with a little trouble, the fish may be procured alive at all seasons of the year.

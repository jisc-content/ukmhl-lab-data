19(3 tkmperatuup: of man tants of warm climates is permanently higher than those of mild ; and that the temperature of different races of mankind, cceteris paribus, is very much alike, are conclusions which the preceding observa- tions on man seem to warrant. The first conclusion, I am aware, is not novel; but I do not know that it was ever drawn before, excepting from very scanty data. The second conclusion, though conformable with the first, is 1 believe new; indeed it is contrary to a received opinion, that the temperature of man in warm climates is actually lower than in cold. The opinion alluded to, I conceive, arose partly from hypothetical views of the subject; and if I recollect rightly, it has been su])ported only by two or three observations recorded by Dr. Chalmers, in his His- tory of South Carolina, which were made at a time when thermometrical experiments were not very common, and when the standard temperature of man was rated much too low. Further refutation of this opinion is perhaps unnecessary. The ex- periments I have made with all the care in my power, are so numerous, and their results are so consistent, that if I do not deceive myself, they put the question beyond the shadow of doubt, and fix as a fact, that if the standard temperature of man, in a temperate climate, be about 98“ (which I believe is the greatest approximation to the truth) in a hot climate it will be higher, varying with atmo- spheric variations from 98^“ to 101“

220 TEMPERATURE OF FISHES the Sicilian coast, in which the viscera of tlie fish are considered the perquisite of the common fisher- men, and are instantly taken out by them when the fish are caught. From the tunny, I extended the inquiry to other fish of the same family ; and learnt that the analogy holds good applied to all the species of the genus Thynnus, of Cuvier and Valenciennes, with which the Maltese fishermen are acquainted, viz. T. brem- pinnis, T. thunnma, T. alalonga^ and the two already mentioned ; all of which abound in blood, have a powerful heart, red or reddish muscles, and also, as I have ascertained by particular examination, have their gills amply provided with large nerves. Not having been able to procure any of these fish alive, their exact temperature I have not been able to determine; but, from the reports of the fishermen, it would appear that the common Tunny is the warmest of the species, and in accordance with this, I have found its branchial nerves proportionally largest. These nerves are represented in Plate XIII. of their natural size, in a young fish which was about three feet long, caught in the channel of Malta, in Novem- ber. Immediately after quitting the cranium, they enter or swell out into ganglia of considerable size, more or less connected together, from whence five principal trunks proceed ; the first four chiefly to the branchia, and are the respiratory nerves; the fifth, the lowest, to the oesophagus and stomach, and the

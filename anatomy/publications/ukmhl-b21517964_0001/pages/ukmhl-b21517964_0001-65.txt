45 ON THE TORPEDO. cation was interrupted by a strong solution of salt. In this instance the full power of the fish appeared to pass; water was decomposed, a shock was re- ceived, needles w^ere magnetised, and the multiplier w'as affected. When the same experiment was made on the electricity excited by the small voltaic combination of a single plate of copper and zinc, each less than an inch in length, and half an inch in breadth, immersed in an acid, neither water was decomposed, nor was the multiplier affected. When it was made on the electricity of the electrical ma- chine, by means of a Leyden jar, all the effects were witnessed, excepting the motion of the multi- plier, and the order of succession of poles in the needles magnetised in the spirals. How are these differences to be explained? Do they admit of ex- planation similar to that advanced by Mr. Cavendish, in his theory of the torpedo, and which has recently been ably advocated by Mr. Faraday ? or are they more in accordance with the idea which my brother was disposed to adopt, that the electricity of the torpedo and of the other electrical fishes is peculiar,â€” a power sui generis? or, lastly, may we suppose, according to the analogy of the solar ray, that it is not a single power, but a combination of powers ? The first opinion, which is commonly received, is supported by the majority of facts detailed in the preceding pages. The circumstance principally hos- tile to it, at least in appearance, is the interruption of the torpedinal electricity by the smallest quantity

34 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS tinous fluid. Their situation too, surrounded by, and exposed to the pressure of powerful muscles, shews, that if condensation is required for the ex- ercise of the electrical function, they may experience it without possessing any muscular fibres in their own substance. The arrangement of the muscles of the back and of the fins, and of the very powerful cross-muscles, situated between the under surfaces of the electrical organs, are admirably adapted to compress them. Without entering into any minute anatomical examination of these muscles and their uses, it is only necessary to compare them in the torpedo, and in any other species of Ray, to be convinced that they are adequate to, and probably designed for the effect mentioned. Mr. Hunter,^ in his account of the torpedo, de- scribes the columns of the electrical organs as com- posed of cells containing a fluid, divided by horizon- tal partitions which he was able to count. This structure seems very probable, and in the specimens I dissected at Rome, I saw what I fancied an ap- proach to it; but I have never witnessed it in a satisfactory manner in the fresh fish. Mr. Hunter inspected large fishes which had been preserved in spirits. The partitions of the columns in them might have been more visible (supposing them to exist) from the action of the spirit on the membrane, and from the greater size of the specimen: or they might have been formed after death in the spirits by * Philosophical Transactions, 1773.

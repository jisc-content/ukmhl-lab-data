108 THE ACRID FLUID SECRETED acrid, acting on the tongue, like the extract of aconite prepared in vacuo; and even occasioning a smarting sensation when applied to the skin of the hand; its effect lasted two or three hours. W'hen heated, it readily melted; burnt with a bright flame, and did not emit an ammoniacal odour. It did not appear to be either acid or alkaline, judging from its not changing the colour of turmeric, or of litmus paper. Caustic ammonia {aqua ammonice) dissolved it, without depriving it of its acrid quality. Nitric acid also dissolved it; forming a purple coloured solution, which neutralized by an alkali, was less acrid, as if partially decomposed. The small portion of the fluid, not soluble either in water or alcohol, and to which it owed its consistence, was probably a variety of albumen; and its ap- pearance, when burning, would seem to warrant this idea. Though this fluid of the toad was more acrid than the poison of the most venomous snakes, it did not appear to have any injurious, and much less fatal, effects, when absorbed and carried into the cir- culation of an animal on which it was tried : thus, a chicken, punctured with a lancet which had been dipped in it, received no apparent injury. And, in confirmation of this statement, I may remark, that although, as already observed, it abounds chiefly in the integuments, it is not confined to them ; I found it in notable quantity in the bile, in minute

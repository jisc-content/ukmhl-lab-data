Papillio Agamemnon.—At Kandy, on the 2d July, air 78°, the temperature of this butterfly, inab- domine, 80°, and in thorace, 81-5. A large butterfly not unlike the preceding, in Eng- land, Nov. 4th, temperature of room 74°, thermometer placed between its wings and abdomen rose to 81°. Scorpio afer.—At Kandy, on the 20th May, at noon, air 79°, the temperature of a large scorpion was 77"5.* in a small vial afforded sufficient light to enable me with perfect ease to see the figures on my watch. The gland or organ by which the luminous matter is secreted, has a tubular arrangement, somewhat perhaps analogous to the electrical organs of the gymnotus and tor- pedo. * The popular idea of the poison of the scorpion, is I believe, far from correct. From the few experiments I have made with this animal, I am induced to infer that its sting is less severe than that of our honey bee. A fowl wounded by a large scorpion in the breast, appeared to suffer little or no inconvenience; the punctured part was only very slightly red, and just perceptibly swollen. I have applied the peculiar fluid twice to the tongue; in one instance, it occasioned a slightly acrid sensation; and in the other, besides the sensation, it blistered the part slightly; the effect w^as very transitory; in a few hours it had ceased. Even in Ceylon, the poetical idea, of the enraged scorpion sting-

53 ON THE TORPEDO. I have heard in conversation from that distinguished traveller and naturalist, Dr. Rouppell, would seem to indicate that the shock of the silurus is more energetic than that of the torpedo ; and that that of the gymnotus is the most energetic, seems not to admit of doubt, considering the well authenticated accounts we have of its effects on large animals, such as the horse, especially as related by M. De Humboldt. But it does not, therefore, necessarily follow, that the power is in other respects proportional; for instance, as a chemical, heating, or a magnetising agent. Certain forms of electricity differ in these manifestations, and why not the electrical power of these fishes ? The question can only be determined by actual experiments. The arrival of a gymnotus in Eng- land, with liberal permission from the proprietors of the Adelaide Gallery of Practical Science to make trial of it, has enabled me to do this, in a partial manner. It was on the 29th of November last, that I made the trial, when I was assured by Mr. Bradley, that the fish was, as it appeared to be, in excellent health. For the sake of comparison, I used the same apparatus as I had employed at Malta on the torpedo, and in the same manner. The first experiment attempted was on the galvanometer. The effect of the electrical discharge of the fish was very decided; the needle made nearly half a circle. The next experiment was on two small

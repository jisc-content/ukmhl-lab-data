24 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS M. De Humboldt states, that the shock of the torpedo may be procured by touching with the finger or hand, one surface only of the fish.* The experi- ments which I have made expressly on this point have led me to a different conclusion, namely, that it is requisite to touch the opposite surfaces of the electrical organs or organ, or a conductor or con- ductors connected with them, to receive a shock. In very many instances that I have irritated torpedos by pressing with the finger on different parts of the back, as the upper surface of the electrical organs, and on the margin of the pectoral fins, however much the fish were irritated, I never had any sensa- tion excited by the electricity which there was reason to believe was discharged; though imme- diately after, on touching the two surfaces, irritating only the upper, shocks were received. On some few occasions, I have perceived a shock, when apparently only one surface of the fish was touched; but I believe in those instances the discharge took place through the water.f In corroboration I may mention, that in experiments in which one surface only has been touched and irritated, the fish itself appears to make an effort to bring, by muscular exertion, the border of the under surface (the upper being pressed on) in contact with the offending body; â€¢ Annales de Chimie et de Physique, tom. xi. p. 430. t The most remarkable example of the kind of which I have any note, was that of a young torpedo, which gave slight shocks to the hand on which it was supported, whether just under the surface of the water, or just after it was taken out of the water into the air.

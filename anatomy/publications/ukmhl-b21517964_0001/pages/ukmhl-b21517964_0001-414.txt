394 PROPORTION OF CALCAREOUS AND from other circumstances than deficiency of phos- phate of lime. This is a point deserving special inquiry. Probably it will be found that in regard to strength and power of resistance, more depends on the arrangement of the constituent particles, and the proportion of fluid matter interposed, than on the quantity of solid contents, especially the cal- careous portion. Table III. Proportion of Calcareous and Animal Matter in Bone of different Animals. No. Description of Bone. Calcar. Matter. Animal Matter. 1 Portion of the tympanum of a whale, the spe- cies not determined: of specific gravity 224, and after ha\ung been subjected to the air-pump 246 .... 81-2 18-8 2 Pars petrosa of the temporal bone of another whale, species not known, from Dr. Mon- ro’s museum 72-6 27-4 3 Pars petrosa of an elephant, from the same museum 70-0 30-0 4 Under-jaw of another elephant 70-8 29-2 5 Under-jaw of hippopotamus 67-3 32.7 6 Under-jaw of dromedary . . . . 68-4 31-6 7 Metatarsal bone of a pure-bred horse, “ Lo- renzo,” six years old, (just taken from the maceratering tub) of specific gravity 1854, and after having been subjected to the air- pump 2033: it lost by thorough drying 9’5 per cent. 65-77 34-23 8 Metacarpal bone of a troop horse rather lower bred than usual, (prepared partly by ma- cerating, partly by boiling) of specific gra- vity 2010, before action of air-pump, and 2077 after: it lost by thorough drying 5'45 65-78 34-22 9 Shaft of humerus of a blood-horse (the com- pact part) before being subjected to air- pump, of specific gravity 2045: after, 2092; it lost by thorough drying 7 per cent. 69-44 30-56

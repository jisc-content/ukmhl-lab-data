VESICUL^ SEMINALES IN MAN. 337 the majority of which have always been dead ;* and thus, perhaps, seeming to indicate that the vesiciilae are cloacae as well as reservoirs, and are essentially designed for man, to enable him to control and to exercise that moral check on the passions, by which he should be distinguished from brute animals, and without which no considerable advance can be made in civilization, or in elevation of individual condition and character. Relative to the effects of disease on the fluid of the vesicLilse seminales, and on the spermatic fluid generally, the instances brought forward are too few to admit of extensive induction. They seem to shew, 1st, that tubercular consumption, even in its advanced stage, has little effect, in preventing the secretion of the testes, or the production of those animalcules, on which, there is much reason to infer, the active power of the semen depends; 2dly, that other wasting diseases, terminating in death, have the effect of arresting the secretion; 3dly, that the contents of the vesiculse, and vasa deferentia, under the influence of disease, retain longer their charac- teristic qualities than the contents of the tubuli; and 4thly, that there is least fluid in the vesiculse and in the vasa deferentia, and that it is most altered in * On rest, contrary to what Hunter states, I have found this fluid separate into two parts—a sediment containing the animalcules and opaque, and a clear supernatant fluid destitute of animalcules—thus analogous also to the spermatic fluid.

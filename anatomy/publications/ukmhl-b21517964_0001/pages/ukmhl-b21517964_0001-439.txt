ANATOMICAL PREPARATIONS IN HOT CLIMATES. 41Q and bile, especially the coloring matter of the for- mer, is of greater specific gravity than water, and consequently has a tendency to subside rapidly and collect at the bottom; and 2dly, that the colouring matter of both, and more particularly of blood, in solution in water, has the power of combining with animal textures, and of staining or dyeing them. By using a tall vessel in the manner suggested, the colouring matter in dissolving, will rapidly quit the part immersed, and descend beneath it; and by employing a large quantity of water, the object of separation is more effectually attained, and very fre- quent change of water is so much the less necessary. Demonstrative proof may be easily obtained of the propriety of these directions, by reversing them, as by allowing the part in steeping to sink to the bottom, or by using a shallow vessel or a small quantity of water. In the former instance, the part will necessarily be immersed in a strong solution of the colouring matter, and will be intensely dyed; and in the latter, the effect will be very similar, presuming that the colouring matter is diffused through the whole of the water.* I may appear to lay too much stress upon these points : but, in reality, they are very important, and commonly not * Vide note Vol. II, p. 194, for further remarks on the staining agency of the colouring matter of blood. Whether dissolved in con- sequence of incipient putrefaction in seram, or merely in water pre- vious to putrefaction even in an incipient state, its dying power ap- pears to be similar. E E 2

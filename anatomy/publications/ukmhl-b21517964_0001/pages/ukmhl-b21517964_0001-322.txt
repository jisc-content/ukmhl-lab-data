30*2 PECULIARITY OF STRUCTURE OCCURRING the individuals varied from 19 to 59 ; two were 25, indications of such action observed ; the lining membrane contiguous was smooth, and there was no thickening where the ends of the band were inserted. The basilar artery, in the manner in which it is formed, and the thinness of its coats, may be con- sidered as approximating to a vein. The similarity is increased by the peculiarity in question. Bands of the same kind are not uncommon in the longitu- dinal sinus, and more delicate bands and fibres are frequently met with in the heart in the right auricle, especially about the fossa ovalis, and in connexion with the eustachian valve. Whether this peculiarity of structure has a decided use, I am not prepared to say. In each instance in which a band or fibre presents itself, support is af- fordedâ€”additional strength is imparted. The band I have described as occasionally occurring in the basilar artery must necessarily have this effect. It was in the month of June 1837, that my atten- tion was first attracted to the subject. Since that time, during a period of about sixteen months, I have taken every opportunity that has offered to examine the basilar artery. In 98 post-mortem examinations at which I have been present, made in the General Hospital, at Fort Pitt, in the time spe- cified, I have met with it in seventeen instances. In nine, death was owing to pulmonary consumption; in two, to malignant tumour ; in the remainder, in each instance, to a different disease. The ages of

89 ON THE TORPEDO. the third, and inferior division, without valvuloe, des- titute of apparent villi, corresponding to the large intestine of the mammalia, and birds, communicating near its termination with the urinary and sexual organs by their respective canals, and also with a small hollow nearly heart-shaped glandular appendi- CLila, attached to its upper part, within the folds of the peritoneum, the function of which I believe is to secrete mucus. The diagram, Plate XII. fig. 1. shews the form and dimensions of the stomach and intestines, and of the pancreas and spleen in situ, taken from a fish about 18 inches long. The stomach is the only part of the canal which is arched.* Its long py- loric portion is striated ; its great arch is most dis- tinctly rugose. The alimentary canal, although not so amply supplied with mucous glands as the integuments, which in the majority of fishes may be considered as the principal mucous membrane, is not deficient in these organs: they are largest and most dis- tinct in the oesophagus; smaller and more numerous in the stomach, and still smaller and comparatively apparently few in number in the intestine. They to snicill sections of the others. Some of the plates are connected together by slender oblique processes. * Lorenzini, in his account of the torpedo, denies its having an oesophagus :—“Lo stomaco ^ continuato con la bocca senza esofago, formando con essa bocca una sola et una medesiina cavita, la quale a proporzione dell’ animale e vasta,”—and he gives a figure in accord- ance with his description.

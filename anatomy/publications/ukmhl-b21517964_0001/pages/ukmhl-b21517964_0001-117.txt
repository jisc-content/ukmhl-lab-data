OF SOME OF THE AMPHIBIA. 97 pure lithic acid. Such I found it in every instance, in at least eight in which I tried it; and its proper- ties, whether fresh from the ureter, or after it had collected in the receptacle, or later when voided, were not materially different, excepting, as I believe (and this is matter of after-inference formed on reflection) that the fresh secretion contained no free ammonia, or even lithate of ammonia, the existence of which, I apprehend, when it occurs, is owing to partial decomposition. Subjected to ex- amination before the blow-pipe, it emitted strong ammoniacal fumes, consumed without flame, and afforded only a very minute quantity of ash, which consisted chiefly of phosphate of lime, and a fixed alkaline phosphate, and a little carbonate of lime. In muriatic acid, it was insoluble. In warm dilute nitric acid, it dissolved with effervescence, and the solution evaporated afforded the pink residue, almost peculiar to lithic acid. In an alkaline ley, it was soluble, and the solution was precipitated by muriatic acid. These properties sufficiently proved that the nature of the urine was as above stated. Besides lithic acid, I was not able to detect any other ingredient, nor do I believe that the specimens which I examined contained any other, with the ex- ception of a minute quantity of mucus with which they were lubricated and mixed.

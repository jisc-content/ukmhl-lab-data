298 EFFECTS OF THE SUN’s RAYS do exist, and act beneficially, seems undoubted. There is reason to infer, that the greater the atmo- spheric temperature is, the less oxygen is consumed in respiration,—that the blood is less aerated, and there is less heat in consequence produced. Some facts bearing on this curious point have already been mentioned, when treating of animal temperature in summer and winter; and further on, some other facts tending to illustrate it will be brought forward, in an account of observations on the blood, in connexion with respiration. Besides this, probably, the princi- pal balancing circumstance, others in addition may be pointed out by which nature fits man to bear with impunity, and with comparatively little inconvenience, the heat of the hottest regions of the globe of which he is a native. In a hot climate, especially within the tropics, the cuticle appears to be thinner than in a cold climate, so as to confine the animal heat less.* Moreover, I believe that the exhalants of the skin, and indeed the whole apparatus peculiar to this tex- ture is either more developed or more active, or both, under the influence of a high than of a low or mode- rate degree of temperature. And the condition of the blood seems to accord, as cold appears to increase * The cuticle of the sole of the foot and of the palm of the hand is, under certain circumstances, an exception, as when exposed unpro- tected to the action of a hot surface, or subjected to much pressure. I have seen a negro sleeping with his feet so close to a fire, that the outer exposed surface was almost scalding to the hand applied to it, and yet, owing to the tlnckness of the part, to the individual it trans- mitted merely an agreeable warmth.

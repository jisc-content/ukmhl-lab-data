PNEUMATHORAX. 263 and which I may briefly notice, seems to afford some proof of it. Immediately after death, before the muscles had lost their irritability, I inflated the lung of a dog under water, by means of a double bellows, through the trachea. Air, in exceedingly minute bubbles, escaped from the surface of the pleura covering one of the inferior lobes; and, on making gentle pressure with the fingers on any part of the inflated viscus, the same appearance pre- sented itself. These circumstances, which I have ventured to bring forward as somewhat favourable to the idea of the secretion or exhalation of azote, are still far from conclusive. After having given the subject all the attention in my power, 1 do not venture to draw a positive conclusion. I have thought it right to state what I have observed relative to a topic so interesting and obscure, and to notice such facts as seemed to bear more immediately on the question, in hope of exciting further inquiry, by which alone the true source of the azote apparently evolved in the pre- ceding instance can be ascertained. The effect of nitrous gas introduced into the pleura now requires consideration. I have made several trials farther with this gas. When admitted nearly pure into the pleura, it produced very serious symptoms; but did not prove fatal, provided the lung on the opposite side was free to act. The dis- tressing symptoms usually subsided in about twelve hours, and then, on killing the animal, the greater

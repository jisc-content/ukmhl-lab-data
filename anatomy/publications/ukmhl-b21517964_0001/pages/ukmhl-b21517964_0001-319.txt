Thus, by promoting perspiration, it will contribute to the cool- ing of the surface ; and being cooled itself, it will contribute again, when it flows back to the heart, to the reduction of the temperature of the internal parts.* Lastly, peculiarity of constitution appears to be intimately connected with climate, and the tolerance of different degrees of temperature with impunity. The African enjoys the best health, is in the highest spirits, and is capable of the greatest exertions in hot moist regions, where the temperature is seldom below 80°; and is almost entirely exempt from those fevers of the intermittent and remittent type which have been, and probably always will be, the scourge and destruction of Europeans in hot climates, j* But, * I deduce this opinion of the blood being more liquid at a com- paratively high temperature, as 88° or 98°, than at a low one, as 38° or 48°, from experiments on the blood, which will be given in the sequel, shewing that a certain degree of cold thickens the blood, and that a certain degree of heat renders it more liquid, so that in one state it is better fitted for torpid hibernating animals, and those of a cold climate, and in the other, for animals in whom the functions of life are performed with energy, and that constantly, as in a warm climate. t In regions more unwholesome to Europeans than the Maremma, of Italy, as (to state from my own experience) in some parts of the interior of Ceylon, where not one European in a hun dred escaped fever, and the majority of those attacked, died; an instance of inter- mittent, or of remittent fever was of extremely rare occurrence amongst the Black troops, who were employed in common with our

305 IN THE BASILAR ARTERY OE MAN. namely,â€”for the purpose of shewing how much more frequently the peculiarities of structure refer- red to, occurred in the bodies, which died in one month than in another. The greater frequency of rare occurrences at one time than another, is a cir- cumstance extremely curious and mysterious, and I have often been impressed by it, as, I believe, others have been, both in hospital practice and engaged in anatomical researches. I shall mention a few in- stances, from memory, as examples of such impres- sions. 1. An oblique opening in the fossa ovalis of the heart, occasionally of such frequent occurrence as to give the idea of its being normal. 2. The eustachian valve of large dimensions in the adult, nearly as large in proportion as in the foetal heart. 3. A fibrous filamentous connexion between the eustachian valve and the auricular septum. 4. The mouth of the coronary vein destitute of a valve. 5. Delicate tendinous filaments or threads, bor- dering the semilunar valves, especially of the aorta, giving the idea of an atrophied state. 6. The ligamentous cord, the remains of the ductus arteriosus, ossified. 7. Fibrinous concretions containing a purulent- like matter, formed during life, in the iliac and femoral veins, and also in the ventricles of the heart, most frequently in cases of phthisis. VOL. I. x

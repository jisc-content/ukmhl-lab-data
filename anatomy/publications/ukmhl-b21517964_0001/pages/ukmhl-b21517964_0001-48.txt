28 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS When 1 have examined with a single lens, which magnifies more than two hundred times, a column of the electrical organ, it has not exhibited any regular structure; it has appeared as an homo- geneous mass, with a few fibres passing into it in irregular directions, which were probably nervous fibres.* The specific gravity of the electrical organ, in comparison with that of parts of the fish decidedly muscular, is very low; including the upper, and under boundary of skin, I have found it T026 to water as Iâ€™OOO. The specific gravity of a portion of the abdominal muscles of the same full grown fish was 1*058, and that of the thick strong muscles of the back close to the spine T065. The loss of weight which the electrical organ sustains by drying, is greater than I have observed in any other part of the fish. I shall give the results of one trial; the statement will convey an idea of the bulk of the different parts of the torpedo, as well as of the proportion of solid matter which they con- tain. The subject of the experiment, procured fresh from the fish market at Rome, was 8 inches long, and across the widest part 5 inches broad. Entire it weighed 2065 grains. It was carefully * Farther microscopic examination has confirmed the above obser- vation. The fibres of the voluntary muscles, even after having been four years in spirits, exhibited the peculiar transverse striated appear- ance : no regularity of structure; nothing distinctly characteristic was visible in the tissue of the organ in question.

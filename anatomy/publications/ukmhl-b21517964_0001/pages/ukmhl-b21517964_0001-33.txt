13 ON THE TORPEDO. placed in a spiral, both forming part of the circle. When heat has been applied to the entire link of platina by means of a spirit lamp, so as to render it red hot, the diminution of effect disappeared; and equally so, as well as I could judge from many ex- periments, whether acting on the thermometer, the galvanometer, or the needle in the spiral. It appeared not improbable that a short portion of very fine platina wire might be ignited in the passage of the electricity of the torpedo. I have made several experiments to ascertain this, but I have never witnessed the effect, even in perfect darkness, and using fish, the discharge of whose electricity at the same time converted a needle into a tolerably powerful magnet; the needle having been put into a spiral connected with the fine wire, so as to afford a test of the strength of the electri- city. This want of ignition may at first view seem contrary to the effect on the thermometer; but, perhaps, it ought not to be considered so, taking into account the rapid manner in which the heat evolved in the fine platina wire must be carried off by the adjoining compound wire of platina and silver. The experiments which I have made on the electricity of the torpedo as a chemical agent, have been of a satisfactory kind. A small glass globe, of the capacity of about half a cubic inch, was used for holding the fluid to be acted on; and fine wires communicating with the contact-wires, were in-

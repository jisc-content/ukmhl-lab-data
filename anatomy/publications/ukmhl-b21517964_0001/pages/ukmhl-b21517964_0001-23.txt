ON THE TORPEDO. 3 The researches which I instituted in compliance with these his wishes, I had the satisfaction of com- mencing at Rome, in his presence, and of thinking that they afforded him amusement in his last days ; they were continued in Malta, and finished in Eng- land. The experiments on the living fish were entirely made in Malta, under very favourable cir- cumstances : the anatomical part of the enquiry was commenced at Rome. Most of the results have already been published in the Philosophical Transactions, in two papers,â€”the first of which was read at the Royal Society in March, 1832, and the second in June, 1834. I may premise that when I entered on the enquiry, it had not been ascertained, that the electricity of the torpedo, con- sidering its peculiar influence to be electrical, had either the power of acting electro-chemically, in separating the elements of any compound bodies; or magnetically, either in affecting the needle in the multiplier, or in imparting magnetism to iron; or lastly, of generating or producing heat: points to which my experiments were particularly directed, and with positive and successful results. I may further remark, that in describing the results ob- tained, I shall not strictly follow the same order as w^as observed in my first publication, or restrict myself entirely to the details given in them: what in those were necessarily disjointed, will here be incorporated; and I shall make without hesitation B 2

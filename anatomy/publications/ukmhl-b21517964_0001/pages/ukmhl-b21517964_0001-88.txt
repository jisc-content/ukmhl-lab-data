08 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS branchial apertures, attached to the head, anterior to the eyes, in the situation of the principal cluster of mucous glands in the adult fish between the anterior portions of the two electrical organs. May not this be considered an instantia crucis, both as shewing that the branchial filaments are not solely designed as a substitute for the gills, and rendering it highly probable that they are concerned, not only in the development of the electrical organs, but also of the mucous glands ? It is not necessary to discuss the other two modes in which the foetus of the torpedo is nourished, ana- lagous to what is witnessed in the chick in ovo ; first, by means of vessels conveying blood, passing from the yolk membrane, and afterwards in addition by the direct passage of the substance of the yolk into the intestine of the foetus, through the vitello-intes- tinal canal. Whether the foetus of those squali and rays which are considered ovi-viviparous, are only nourished in these two ways, or also in the additional manner of the foetus of the torpedo, is a subject for inquiry. From what I have observed, I am rather disposed to think that they are nourished in the latter manner, though in a less degree, and without excepting even those which are contained in a closed membrane. From the facts given in the preceding tables, and from others which I have observed, it may be inferred that the torpedo does not bear young more than once a year; that the breeding season is the latter end of

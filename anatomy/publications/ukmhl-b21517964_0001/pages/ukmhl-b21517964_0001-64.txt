EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 44 tliese its general effects, it does not seem to be essentially peculiar, but as much allied to voltaic electricity, as voltaic electricity is to atmospheric, or atmospheric electricity is to that produced by contact or friction. When we examine more minutely its phenomena or effects, in relation to these different kinds or varieties of electricity, certain points of difference occur. Compared with voltaic electricity, its effect on the multiplier is feeble; its power of decomposing water and metallic solutions is inconsiderable; but its power of giving a shock is great, and so also is its power of magnetising iron. Compared with common electricity, it has a power of affecting the multiplier, which under ordinary circumstances, common electricity does not exhibit; its chemical effects are more distinct; its power of magnetising iron,* and giving a shock appear very similar; its power of passing through air is infinitely less; as is also its power of pro- ducing heat. There are other points of difference; I allude chiefly to the results obtained in the experiments already described, in which the metallic communi- * There is this difference when two spirals are used, one connected with the inside of a Leyden jar, and the other with the outside; a needle in each, similarly placed, acquires opposite polarities, the north pole in one being where the south pole is in the other; whilst in the instance of the torpedo they accord, so that a line of needles, passing from one side of the electrical organ to the other, would ex- hibit a succession of similar poles.

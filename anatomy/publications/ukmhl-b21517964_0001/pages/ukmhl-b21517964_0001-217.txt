AND OTHER ANIMALS. 197 The third conclusion I believe to be perfectly accurate ; I say believe, because it is difficult, if not impossible, to collect more than presumptive evi- dence on the subject. However, may not the evi- dence be considered sufficiently satisfactory, since the variation of the temperature of the different races I tried did not exceed, in degree, what may be witnessed amongst different individuals of a ship’s company, all of one nation, or even amongst dif- ferent members of the same family ?—The similarity of temperature in different races of men is the more remarkable, since between several of them whose temperatures agreed, there was nothing in common but tiie air they breathed,—some feeding on animal food almost entirely, as the Vaida,—others chiefly on vegetable diet, as the priests of Boodho,—and others, as Europeans and Africans, on neither ex- clusively, but on a mixture of both. Farther, that the temperature of birds, of all animals is the highest,—that of the mammalia next, —that of the amphibia, fishes, and certain insects next in degree,—and lowest of all, that of the mol- lusca, Crustacea, and worms,—are conclusions, with few exceptions, that may be deduced from the pre- ceding experiments on the temperature of animals in general. Moreover, since in general, so far as experiment and observation have yet gone, there appears to be a decided connection between the quantity of oxygen consumed by an animal, and the animal’s heat, is

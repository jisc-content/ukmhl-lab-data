195 AND OTHER ANIMALS. Julus,—At Kandy, on the 18th of June, at noon, air 80°, the temperature of a julus was 78'5. It was of that species which emits a yellowish fluid, hav- ing the smell of iodine, and which colours the cuticle, not unlike iodine, but has no effect on polished steel. 8.— Of the Temperature of Worms. The only worms, the temperature of which I have tried, were two kinds of leech, the Hirudo sanguisuga, and a species which in Ceylon is called the Jungle Leech, remarkable for living out of water in damp places. The temperature of both was the same as that of the w^ater and air in which they were confined. I may remark, generally, that in the few experiments I have made to ascertain the temperature of small animals of the lower classes, a very small thermometer was used in each instance, introduced through a small incision into the body. IV.—Conclusions and General Remarks. That the temperature of man increases in passing from a cold or even temperate climate, into one that is warm; that the temperature of the inhabi- ing himself to death, is entertained; but I never witnessed such a result. On one occasion I saw the experiment of encircling a scor- pion by fire, confidently made by an English gentleman, but without effect, no danger from the flames, no provocation could induce the animal to wound himself. Perhaps, occasionally, when extremely irritated, it may do so,—not knowing what he is doing. o 2

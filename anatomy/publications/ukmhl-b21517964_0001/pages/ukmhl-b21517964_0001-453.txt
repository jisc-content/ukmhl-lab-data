RISING FROM THE ARCH OF AORTA. 433 Hector M^Callum, of the 42nd regiment, aged 36 ; twenty-two years a drummer in that corps; notwithstanding intemperate habits, had good health, until the beginning of 1833 ; when he first expe- rienced some difficulty of breathing ; but he conti- nued at his duty until the 18th of February 1834. He was then admitted into hospital, at Malta, and I frequently saw him in company with the able surgeon of the regiment. Dr. Nicholson, (now Assistant-In- spector of Hospitals,) to whom I am indebted for most of the particulars of the case. The principal symp- toms at that time were palpitation with tumultuous action of the heart, greatly aggravated by bodily ex- ertion, with dyspnoea, aggravated by the same cause, occurring in paroxysms, during which he experienced temporary loss of vision, and occasionally syncope. No pulse could be felt at either wrist, nor in the brachial arteries, and indistinctly only in the carotid arteries, but strong in the femoral. The tongue was clean, the appetite good, the functions generally (independent of respiration) well performed ; yet he was feeble. He gradually became worse. In May, the dyspnoea was continually severe, often threatening suffocation, the face assuming a livid hue, with great agony of suffering. Now, no pulsa- tion could be felt in the left carotid artery, and only very indistinctly in the right, without return of the pulse in either wrist. He died suddenly on the 2d of June.

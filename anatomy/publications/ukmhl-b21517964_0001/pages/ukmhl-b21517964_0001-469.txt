HEART AND GREAT VESSELS. 449 great force was required to introduce more water; the vein towards the heart was amazingly distended, and shortly the pressure being continued, it became ruptured ; the effect took place just before the entering of the vessel into the anterior mediastinum. It seemed as it were rather the separation of its fibres with distension, than the breaking of them from distension. Experiment 15. The vertebral arteries, where they enter the cra- nium having been secured by ligature, and the left carotid artery in the neck having also been tied, the pipe of the syringe was placed in the right carotid artery, and water was injected,—the cavity of the chest and abdomen remaining unopened. Very little resistance was experienced till a large quantity of water had been injected, and even when an enor- mous quantity had been introduced, the resistance was not considerable. The experiment was discontinued when the flow of water from the neck, the nostrils and the inside of the cranium, was almost equal in quan- tity to that which could be thrown in. This flow of water seemed to be from exudation. The body was amazingly distended, and exhibited a very singular appearance,—the penis turgid, the mamillse dilated, their papillse erect, the trunk and limbs, tense, rounded and filled out, which, (with the exception of the abdomen in which some fluid was effused in VOL.

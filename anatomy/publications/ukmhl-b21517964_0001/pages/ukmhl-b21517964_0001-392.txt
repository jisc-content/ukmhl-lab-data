372 ON THE APPLICATION OF SULPHUROUS and in every instance of tendency to it, I have found the inner and middle coat of the vessel diseased ; the latter generally diminished in thickness, and rendered brittle, and sometimes entirely absorbed in the dilated part of a true aneurism, or in the part contiguous to the orifice communicating with the sac of the false; and the inner coat corresponding generally thickened, and corrugated, and easily broken. In many instances, since I have used the sulphurous acid, I have noticed a very strong ten- dency in the arteries to aneurism, with only incipient dilatation, in which the middle coat of the vessel has been partially reduced to the thinness of the finest paper, and its colour changed to yellow ; and the inner membrane admitting of being easily detached, has been thickened to thrice or more its thickness in its sound state. Lastly, in relation to the use of sulphurous acid for anatomical purposes, I must not conclude without offering some precautions taught by experience, the neglect of which may occasion want of success. 1. It is of consequence that the part to be pre- served should be immersed in the acid, as soon as possible; for if in the slightest degree putrid, it will not be well preserved, the fluid will become turbid, though frequently changed, and the pre- paration will not keep. 2. If the part be putrid, as is often the case, when taken from the body, though the post-mortem exami-

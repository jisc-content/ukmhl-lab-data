100 URINARY ORGANS AND SECRETION in little firm masses, and partly in the form of sand and gravel, not crystalline, mixed with a little urea. The latter was in solution ; it was detected in a very minute quantity of brown liquid, the only portion of the urine that was fluid. This tortoise, it may be remarked, was brought from the Mediterranean (I believe, from the Ionian Islands) in the summer of 183G. It passed the winter, according to its habit, in a torpid state. It was on the first of March following, that it was sub- jected to examination. Then its period of hyber- nation was just over ; it had begun to shew signs of activity. For several months it had ate nothing, and, it is believed, had not voided excrement of any kind. The temperature of the air of the room at the time was 55°, out of doors 50°, the thermometer placed in the rectum fell to 48°, in the blood flowing from the right auricle, it rose to 50°, and in that from the ventricle to 51°.5. 4.— Of the Urinary Organs and Urine of the Frog and Toad. The examination which I made of the urinary organs of these animals in Ceylon, was confined to one species of each,—the bull-frog (Rana taurina, Cuv.) and the brown-toad (Bufo fuscus, Laurentini.) The former was procured from the lake of Colombo, where it occasionally grows to a great size; the latter from the streets of the Pettah, which it fre- quents at night.

()9 ON THE TORPEDO. autumn and the beginning of winter,* and that the period of utero-gestation is from nine to twelve months.f I have alluded, some pages back, to the foetal torpedo at its full term. Whilst I was in Malta, though I examined more than two hundred tor- pedos, I found five only in which the young were arrived at or near this stage. Of these, three were brought alive. I shall give some particulars, chiefly of their broods, as they may not be considered uninteresting in themselves, and as they may tend to illustrate the slow growth, and some of the peculi- arities of this extraordinary fish. The first live torpedo that 1 obtained in this state was an occhiatella on the 12th September. It was 14 inches long and wide, and after the extraction of the foetal fish, it weighed lib. 3oz. It had been caimht rather more than an hour, and was in a small bucket of salt water. I immediately set about pre- * According to Aristotle, it brings forth in autumn. In my first paper, I supposed, erroneously, that the principal breeding season is the spring, from the circumstance that the fish at that time abound in ova of a large size. f I say from nine to twelve months, because I suspect the time of utero-gestation is not precisely fixed, but that it varies with circum- stances favourable, or unfavourable to bringing forth; thus I have had young torpedos brought me, caught in the sea, in which the in- ternal yolk vesicle was large ; and in one instance I found them in utero, with this vesicle greatly reduced in size, so as to suggest the idea which Aristotle adopted, that the young of the torpedo after birth return at will into the uterus,—an idea which cannot be held, on account of its anatomical impossibility.—{Am(.

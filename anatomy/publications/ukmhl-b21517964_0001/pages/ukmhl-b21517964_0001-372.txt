AQUA BINELLI, 352 in surgery accord with it, not to mention the ex- perience of the effects of the aqua Binelli, as certi- fied by men of high respectability.* I have laid stress on the effect of the pressure, afforded by the wet compresses applied in the ex- periments related, believing that the virtue of the means consists in the pressure,—of course not in the water, excepting so far as it renders the com- presses better fitted for adaptation to the wound to produce the degree of resistance requisite to coun- teract the heart’s impulse on the vessel; and also better fitted to exclude atmospherical air. I would also lay stress on the moderate degree of pressure that is produced in the manner described, allowing the blood to pass through the canal of the artery, and as before observed, doing little more than re- sisting the momentum of the blood in its passage from the moving source. The importance of this moderate degree of pressure,—reducing as much as possible the wounded artery to the condition of a wounded vein, is, if I do not deceive myself, very * It was my intention to have given a selection of the certified cases, in favour of the aqua Binelli brought forward in the pamphlet which is furnished with the water; but on reconsidering them, it appeared a superfluous labour, as the results (giving them credit for correctness) however excellent in a curative point of view, are no more than the enlightened surgeon of the present time mt.y readily admit to be owing to water dressings alone without the aid of pres- sure ; the majority of the instances adduced, being examples of gun- shot wounds, and contused wounds, from which there was no profuse bleeding, and no necessity, according to the ordinary mode of sur- gical treatment, for securing wounded vessels.

The sex of the follow- ing, the subjects of observation on the 23d of May, is not mentioned in my notes; the temperature of the air then was 63°. * The temperature of the lung and pleura was found by intro- ducing a thermometer through a small incision in an intercostal space, immediately after the division of the great vessels, whilst the heart was still acting. On the 18th March, in the instance of a full-grown spaniel bitch, the temperature, in recto, was found to he 105°, and in the right pleura, the lung not wounded, 107°. 30 drops of hydrocyanic acid were now introduced into the pleura ; in half a minute the bitch expired, convulsed. The chest w'as immediately opened, the heart was still acting, the temperature of the right ventricle was 104°, of the left ventricle 107°; both ventricles were distended with blood, which afterwards coagulated.

ON THE TORPEDO. 27 trical power. Small, fish are almost always active electrically, and they are greatly to be preferred as subjects for experiments: moreover, they have this advantage,—they can be kept alive a much longer time.* Mr. Walsh noticed, in the fish on which he experimented at Rochelle and the Isle of Re, a retraction of the eyes of the torpedo, at the instant it exercised its electrical function. This I have not witnessed in the torpedos of the Mediterranean ; nor indeed have I been able to associate any visible sign, any apparent movement of the fish, with the electrical discharge. 2.— Ohservations on the Electrical Organs of the Torpedo^ and on some parts of its structure connected with them. The peculiar columnar appearance of the elec- trical organs of the torpedo, and their great pro- portional size, the vast proportion of nerve with which they are supplied, the manner in which the columns are sheathed in tendinous fibres, have been dwelt on by all inquirers who have paid any atten- tion to this fish; but I am not acquainted with any attempt to ascertain by experiment what is the exact nature of the substance of these organs, or the peculiar structure of which they are composed. * The torpedo should be kept in an earthenware vessel, not a wooden one, which exercises some noxious influence on the fish: the water (the purest sea-water that can be procured) should be changed daily ,• and the coolest place should be selected for it,—where the sun never shines.

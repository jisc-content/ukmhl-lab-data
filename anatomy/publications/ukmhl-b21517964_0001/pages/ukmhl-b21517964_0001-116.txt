f)6 URINARY ORGANS AND SECRETION the receptacle, I always observed it pure, and entirely free from fcecal matter. This solid urine, for such it was in reality, had gradually accumu- lated in the receptacle, until it formed the masses just described. From the observations made on snakes which were watched in confinement, it was to be inferred, that the masses were a considerable time in collecting, from three weeks, to a month or six weeks. When the bulk of the masses was so large as to distend the part unduly, they were ex- pelled by an unusual exertion of the animal, most commonly in the act of devouring its food, which was usually taken periodically, at intervals of from three to six weeks. The urine, in the instances in which it was observed, was voided, accompanied occasionally but never mixed with foeces. When expelled, it was commonly in a soft state, of a buty- raceous consistence, which it lost from exposure to the air, when it became hard and in appearance like chalk; a change which I believe was owing merely to the evaporation of moisture. The quantity of solid urine secreted by snakes, is very great, even more than might be expected from the size of their kidneys; I often saw masses, voided by large snakes, which weighed three or four ounces. The chemical nature of this urine was such as I expected to find it: I say, expected, because, before I left England, I had been told by Dr. Prout, that he had examined the excrement of a serpent in London, and had ascertained that it was nearly

80 EXPERIMETS’TS AND OBSERVATIONS its extraordinary electrical function, impart to it peculiar interest, and seem specially to recommend it as an object of various research. The form of the skeleton of the torpedo is well exhibited in Plates VIII. and IX. The drawings were very accurately made from a skeleton of a Torpedo oculata, a male, about six inches long, carefully pre- pared. The bones of which it is formed, as far as I have examined them, appear to be all similar in com- position. Although apparently entirely cartilaginous, they are not so in reality ; they contain earthy mat- ter in the form of phosphate and carbonate of lime in variable proportions ; the cartilage, probably, is the original basis, the earthy matter a superadded deposit. View^ed under the microscope, this compound nature is very manifest. Take, for instance, the principal bone of the pectoral fin; a very thin slice of it—a transverse section appears as if composed externally of irregu- lar polyhedrons, themselves consisting of minute plates and fibres, transmitting little light, reflecting more, and perhaps crystalline ; whilst internally it is nearly transparent, and nearly homogeneous, even wdien dried, exhibiting only a few opaque points. The portion thus examined was previously stripped of its delicate fibrous enveloping tissue, its perichondrium. That the more opaque and obscurely crystalline part owes the peculiarity of its appearance to the presence of phosphate and carbonate of lime, is proved by the action of an acid. Immersed in dilute

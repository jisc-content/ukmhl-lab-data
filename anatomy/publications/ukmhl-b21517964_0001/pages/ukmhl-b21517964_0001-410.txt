390 PROPORTION OF CALCAREOUS AND The specimens from No. 23 to 55 were from crania, prepared for the museum, by the process of boiling, and in the majority of instances, in water in which lime was suspended. To ascertain tlie effects of the process, a portion of the parietal bone No. 25, before being subjected to it, immediately after the post mortem examination, was deprived of its periosteum, and thoroughly dried and then incine- rated ; the residue of calcareous matter was 66‘2 per cent., indicating 33*8 per cent, of animal matter, which, practically considered, and especially in relation to health, it deserves. On the 11th November, the substances which will presently be mentioned, were weighed in a room in which was a fire, and where the thermometer stood at 60°, and a thermometer with its bulb moist- ened used as an hygrometer at 56; the weather was very damp; they were then taken to an alcove in the garden, where the dry thermometer was 50°, the moist 49°; after having been left there an hour, they were weighed on the spot; and next they were dried by the fire completely till all hygrometrical w'ater was expelled, and weighed warm. The results were the following:— Fine flannel . . Room. Alcove. Fire-side.

351 ITS SUPPOSED EFFECTS. coat of the vessel, or in the contiguous parts, nor in- ternally when slit open, excepting on narrow scrutiny, when a faint line was just perceptible, marking the cicatrix, like the impression made by a fine ligature on an artery not drawn sufficiently tight to divide the inner and middle coats (vide Plate XIII, fig. 8). The general results of these experiments, (if I may be allowed to speak so of so small a number) are not without interest in application to surgery. They show how a hemorrhage from the wound of a large artery, which by itself would be speedily fatal, may be easily arrested by moderate compression through the means merely of several folds of linen or cotton moistened with water; and they further shew how, under this moderate compression, the wound in the artery heals, the vessel remains per- vious, and without the formation of an aneurism, and how, after a time, the short space of six weeks, only just perceptible, traces of the wound are discoverable. Under this moderate compression, the healing of the wounded artery seems to be very analogous to that of a wounded vein, and apparently by means of the same natural process. Whether similar results would be obtained were trial made of the same means in the wounds of arteries in the human subject, can only be ascer- tained positively by judicious experiments. The probability is, the results would be the same; the analogy is very complete, and some facts well known

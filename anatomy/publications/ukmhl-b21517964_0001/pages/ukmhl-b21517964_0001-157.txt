THE HEART OF BATRACHIAN ANIMALS. 137 not fitted to perform the function of a valve, I ap- prehend, from what I have observed in watching the heartâ€™s action, that the blood from one auricle would not pass into the other, the contraction of the two auricles being synchronous, the auricles first con- tracting, next the body of the ventricle, and lastly that part of the ventricle of a conical shape, which may be considered almost as a second ventricle. This last mentioned part (to notice it more parti- cularly, as I believe it deserves) appeared from my dissections, to be separated from the body of the ventricle by three valves, of a semilunar form, one large and two small, and to have attached within it, to the side of its cavity, a pale fleshy projection, a moveable septum, above which it gave origin to four great arteries, namely, two pulmonary arteries and two aortae, the latter considerably larger than the former, each provided with its own valve. The action of this part is not a little curious: when I have watched it, it did not appear to contract simul- taneously, as a whole, but one-half first, and then the other, as if intended, in conjunction with the various anastomoses of the arterial system, to pre- serve a constant, though small and feeble current of blood, to supply all the parts of the body accord- ing to their various demands. The same general structure of heart, I have ob- served in the bull-frog distinctly, and in the com- mon frog also, especially its double auricle. Whether it exists in all the other species of the genus, I have

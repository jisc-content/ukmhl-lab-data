ACID TO ANATOMICAL PURPOSES. 303 and anastomosing. The same appearance presents itself in the middle and lower part of the oesopha- gus, and more distinctly. But it is only in the upper part that any nerves can be seen distinctly ramifying in the semi-transparent mucous tissue. In the middle no follicles are visible, and only a few near its termination. Where it terminates, there is, in one preparation before me, quite a zone of what appears to be minute follicles: but this does not shew itself in another preparation. At the cardiac orifice of the stomach many mi- nute follicles present themselves. Where the gullet ends, and the stomach commences, there is a sudden change of the appearance of the mucous texture; the linear marking suddenly ends; and, as it were, a dotted one commences, and with some variations, extends throughout this organ. When magnified, it has the appearance of a very delicate lacework, formed in the upper part, by the close juxta-position of circular lines ; and, in the lower, by lines in the form nearly of the figure of 8; and, in the great arch of the stomach, by lines irregularly tortuous. But this, it must be confessed, is not to be seen in every preparation that I have examined; and, there- fore, I would rather limit myself by saying, that, in the stomach, the mucous texture has the appearance of a very delicate lacework of lines or vessels. At the commencement of the duodenum, the ap- pearance of the texture again distinctly changes. Here it appears as if covered with tortuous threads

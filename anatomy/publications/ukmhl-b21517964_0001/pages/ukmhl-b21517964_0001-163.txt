ON ANIMAL HEAT. 143 venous and arterial blood was not so great as in the sheep’s, and this in a great variety of instances I have always observed, the venous being of a less dark hue. The specific gravity of the venous blood, without the fibrin, was found to be 1050, and that of the arterial 1047- A glass bottle, equal in capacity to 2518 grains of water, and weighing 1332 grains, was filled respectively with water and venous and arterial blood of the temperature of the room 62°, about four hours after the blood had been drawn, during which time each bottle had been closelv corked. A delicate thermometer, by means of a perforated cork, was placed in the middle of the liquid. The bottle was then plunged into water of the temperature 140 Fa- renheit, and when the mercury had risen to 120, the bottle was quickly wiped, and suspended in the middle of the room ; and the progress of cooling was noticed every five minutes till the thermometer had fallen to 80°. The following were the general results obtained. Water cooled from 120" to 80° in 91 minutes. Arterial blood in - - - 89 — Venous blood in - - 88 — Considering, therefore, the capacity of water for heat to be denoted by 1000, neglecting the effect of the glass bottle, producing a difference only of about half a minute, and the same in each instance, and dividing the times of cooling by the specific gravity.

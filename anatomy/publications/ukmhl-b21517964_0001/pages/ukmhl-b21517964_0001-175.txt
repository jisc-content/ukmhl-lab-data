155 ON ANIMAL HEAT. arguments against this hypothesis are to be derived from the experiments of MM. Delaroche and Berard.* Dr. Black’s hypothesis appears to me far more satisfactory than Dr. Crawford’s, and capable of explaining a much greater number of phenomena. The last hypothesis, which I mentioned, that which refers animal heat to vital action, has many facts in its support. It may be said that the viscera of the thorax and abdomen are of the highest temperature, because these parts, are as it were, the elaboratories of life ; and that the heat of the arterial blood, and of the parts best supplied with this fluid, is greatest, because they lie deepest, and abound most in the principle of life or vital action. This explanation was sug- gested to me by my brother. Sir H. Davy. There are some facts which I have observed agreeable to it, but not more so than to the hypothesis of Dr. Black. I have found the stomach of the ox, the pyloric compartment, of a higher temperature than the left ventricle itself; thus, when the latter immediately after death was 103°, the former, full of food, was 104*5. I have also found the temperature of young * On the specific caloric of gases; from which it would appear that the capacity of carbonic acid gas for heat, is actually higher than that of atmospheric air; or in other words, that the capacity of the air expired is greater than of the air inspired; and consequently, in this point of view, respiration ought to be, as it was considered by the ancients, a cooling process.—An. de Chim.

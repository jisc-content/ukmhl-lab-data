258 TWO CASES OF ing and novel, that I was induced to prosecute the subject a little further. With the same apparatus, I made similar experiments on the admission of three other gases into the pleura of dogs, viz.,—hydrogen, nitrous oxide, and nitrous gas,—the results of which I shall briefly describe. About twenty cubic inches of a mixture, consisting of 57’5 parts carbonic acid gas, and 42*5 hydrogen, were admitted into the left pleura of a dog, in the manner, and with the precaution, already noticed. The health of the animal was not apparently affected. At the end of two days, about thirty cubic inches of a mixture, consisting of 44*5 azote, and 55*5 nitrous gas, were passed into the right pleura. Immediately the dog’s breathing became quick and short, but not laborious. It refused to eat, and expired in the evening, at the end of five hours from the time that the air was introduced. The next morning the body was examined. About six cubic inches of air were collected from the left pleura, consisting apparently of 12 carbonic acid, and 88 azote. After the re- moval of the carbonic acid gas, by lime-water, the residual gas extinguished flame, and was not itself the least inflammable ; and hence the inference, that it was azote, or, at least, principally azote, as the pre- sence of a small quantity of hydrogen might be concealed, and escape detection. From the right pleura, about five cubic inches of air were procured, which consisted of 6*9 nitrous gas, or air absorbable

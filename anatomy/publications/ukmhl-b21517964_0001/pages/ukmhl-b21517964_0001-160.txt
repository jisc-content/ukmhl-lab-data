140 STRUCTURE OF HEART OF BATRACIIIAN ANIMALS. descriptive catalogue published in 1831, designed to illustrate the commonly received idea.* The circumstance that Hunter was acquainted with the bi-auricular structure in question, may serve to account for the adoption of it by Sir Everard Home. In his “ Systema Regni Animalis,” in the 3rd volume of his Lectures on Comparative Ana- tomy, he includes the genus Rana in the same class with Lizards and Snakes, to which he assigns “ Cor uniloculare, bi-auritum, sanguine frigido rubro — but without specihcation there, or in any of his writings, of the observations by which the fact was determined. * The following is the account given of two preparations alluded to in the text:—“ 175. The heart of a large toad (Rana Bufo) in- jected. It is composed of a single auricle and ventricle; from the latter, the arterial trunk or aorta arises, and immediately after its origin divides into two branches, which ultimately unite into one des- cending aorta, at the inferior part of the spine. Hunterian.” “176. The heart of a frog (Rana temporaria) injected. As in fishes, the heart is composed of two cavities, a single auricle, and a ventricle.

22 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS circle of communication between the two opposite surfaces of a torpedo, and also a chemical apparatus with platina wires and the solution of iodide of potassium and starch, the shock experienced by the hands has been strong, and the chemical effect either null or slight; no gas appearing when a strong solution of salt has been used, and no precipitation of iodine occurring unless the platina wires were very nearly in contact, and the fish energetic. When, besides the human body, and the chemical apparatus, the galvanometer has been introduced into the circle with the air thermometer and the spiral, the shock has been experienced as if it had been received direct from the fish ; but I have never witnessed at the same time any other effect. Not taking the human body into the circle, in trials on fish of very feeble electricity, I have wit- nessed the precipitation of iodine, when neither the air thermometer, nor a delicate galvanometer with a double needle has been affected. The same kind of evidence has been obtained of the thermometrical test, being next in point of delicacy, inasmuch as I have seen the air thermometer affected by a fish which had no influence on the galvanometer, in connexion with the wire of the thermometer. That the needle in the spiral is the least delicate test, does not require to be insisted on. The elec- tricity of a torpedo, of almost feeble energy, has been equal to produce all the effects alluded to at once, excepting sensation, as already explained, and

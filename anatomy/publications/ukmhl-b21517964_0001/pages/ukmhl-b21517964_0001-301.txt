281 PNEUMATHORAX. scribed by Dr. Baillie in his Morbid Anatomy and considered by him as resulting from the secre- tion of air, and not from the extravasation of air under the pleura, agreeably to the opinion advanced by Laennec.f The air contained in the vesicles in this instance, consisted of 5 parts of azote, and 1 part of carbonic acid. The quantity of air col- lected and examined, did not exceed l-20th of a cubic inch; I could not detect in it, any traces of oxygen. In neither case, it may be remarked, were there any signs of incipient putrefaction; the weather was cool; and the examination was made a few hours after death. * Fifth Edition, p. 80. t Treatise on Diseases of the Chest, &c. p. 89.

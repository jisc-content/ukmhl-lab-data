90 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS are situated in the submucous cellular tissue, and are without visible excretory ducts. The liver is large, composed of two lobes (the right exceeding in size the left) connected by a long narrow isthmus of the same structure. It abounds in oil, and in consequence its specific gra- vity is less than that of water. Every other part of the fish is of greater specific gravity than water; and no other part of it contains any fatty or oily matter. In this respect I believe all the other cartilaginous fishes, and the majority of the flat fishes, are analogous; a large number of them abounding in mucus; all destitute of fat. The liver secretes a transparent, limpid, clear bile of a fine green hue, very bitter, and which, as it is not in the slightest degree viscid, even after lodgment in the gall-bladder, probably contains no mucus. The gall-bladder is large and globular; it is con- nected with the intestine by a long common duct, and with the liver by two hepatic ducts, one only from each lobe. Although the ffall-bladder is half o o imbedded in the substance of the liver, I have not been able to detect any direct communication between them. The common duct, in approaching the intestine, enlarges, and it at the same time becomes thicker, but whether owing to the addition of muscular fibres, or of a mucous glandular structure, I do not know. Where it passes between the coats of the intestine, it is very much smaller; its bore there is extremely contracted. It ter-

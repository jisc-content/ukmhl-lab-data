18 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS novelty in many points, I do not think it riglit to withhold. By connecting the spiral with the multi- plier, and charging the former with as many small needles as it could hold, namely eight, I ascertained that a single discharge of the electricity of an active fish moved the needle in the multiplier powerfully, and converted all the needles into magnets; and each of them, I believe, was as strong as if one only had been used. Using two spirals charged with needles, one con- nected with one end of the multiplier, and the other with the other end, the effects of the discharge were similar to the preceding, both on the needle of the multiplier, and on the needles in the spirals. In two instances the needles in the spiral connected with the upper surface, were most powerfully mag- netised ; and in one instance, the effect was greatest on the needles in the lower spiral. In this last instance, nine needles were acted on in the under spiral, and six in the upper: the fish which produced the effect was, with one exception, the smallest that I had ever used. In a few experiments on metallic conductors, the effect of the electricity of the torpedo on the galvan- ometer appeared to be much the same, whatever metals were used, and whether rusty or bright, pro- vided the junctions were bright. The mass of metal appeared to have more influence; the effect, as might be expected, diminished with the increase of the mass; thus, when a poker weighing about

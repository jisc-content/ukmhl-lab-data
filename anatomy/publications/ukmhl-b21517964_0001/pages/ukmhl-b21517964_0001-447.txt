^ CASE OF CLOSURE OF ARTERIES, ETC. 427 vation, confirms the justness of the conclusion, as clearly I apprehend, as if instituted, were it possible, experimentally for the purpose. As the subject is very important in its physiological relations, as well as in its bearings on pathology, I shall describe this particular instance with some minuteness, al- though not so much in detail as may be desirable, owing to circumstances connected with the indivi- dual. An officer of rank, aged about 55, distinguished for his services in the field during the Peninsular war, and who had been severely wounded in the chest at Waterloo ; after good health for several years, had, when absent in England from his command in the Mediterranean, in the winter of 1831, an attack, which 1 was informed was consi- dered rheumatic, attended with pain in the right shoulder, for which calomel and opium were largely prescribed.

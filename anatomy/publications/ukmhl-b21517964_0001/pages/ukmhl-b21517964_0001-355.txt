335 VESICUL.^: SEMINALES OF MAN. vesiculae was of a lighter colour than is usually found in men who have been dead a considerable time; but it was by no means like the semen either in colour or smell.” And, he adds, “ in another man who died instantaneously in consequence of falling a considerable height, and whose body I inspected soon after the accident, I found the contents of the vesiculae of a lightish whey-colour, having nothing of the smell of semen, and in so fluid a state as to run out on cutting into them.”* The colour which the fluid of the vesiculse commonly exhibits in late post-mortem examinations is probably partly derived from the infiltration of some of the colouring matter of the blood after death, and, in part, perhaps occasionally, from a vitiated secretion of the folli- cles, or secreting surface of the vesiculae, and of the adjoining vasa deferentia.f It would be a work of supererogation to enter into a detailed examination of the arguments brought forward by Hunter in support of the views he advo- cated relative to the vesiculae and their contents : it has been ably done by Meckel in his Manual of Anatomy, by whom each argument has been seriatim * Observations on certain parts of the animal economy.

London, 1786, p. 28. t Occasionally after death, not only is the fluid of the vesiculae found of a brownish discoloration, but also the inner surface of the vesiculae, and of that portion of the vasa deferentia which is con- tiguous, and of similar structure; indeed, I have seen the portion of the vasa deferentia just mentioned more discoloured than the vesi- culac themselves.

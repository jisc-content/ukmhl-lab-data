74 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS of all the three parent fish were very small, the largest of them not exceeding a pea, and the majority of them minute vesicles containing a trans- parent fluid. Other inferences might be drawn from the de- tails, especially in favour of the branchial filaments being absorbent organs, rather than supplying the place of gills, (the gills being apparently useless in utero when formed.) In the beginning of this section, I have alluded to the discrepancy which exists amongst writers on natural history relative to the mode of generation of the torpedo. Aristotle always describes this fish as viviparous; so does Lorenzini, who wrote in the middle of the seventeenth century. On the contrary, Blumenbach, generally an accurate writer, though he quotes Lorenzini, gives the torpedo as an example of the oviparous cartilaginous fish, laying a few large eggs, protected by a horny shell; and, even Cuvier appears to have fallen into the same error, at least in his Regne Animal, he has not corrected it; and from his general account of the generation of the rays, both in this work and in the Histoire Nat. des Poissons, it is to be in- ferred. It is most probable that analogy and a want of confidence in Aristotle and Lorenzini, were the cause of this mistake ; no doubt, had these able men enjoyed an opportunity of investigating the subject themselves, they would not have failed in ascertaining the truth. Even in Malta, the inquirv

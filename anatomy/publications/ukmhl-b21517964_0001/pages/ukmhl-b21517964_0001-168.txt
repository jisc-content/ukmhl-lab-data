ACCOUNT OF EXPERIMENTS 148 The following results were obtained from three experiments on sheep, the exact age of which I could not ascertain. The thermometer in the shade was 60°. 1. Venous blood 103*5 Arterial blood 104°*5 2. - • - 102*5 - - 104° 3. - - 103° - - 104° The experiments on oxen were only two in num- ber. The temperature of the air was 64°. 1. Venous blood lOO"' Arterial blood 101*5 2. - - 100° - - 101° In both instances the oxen were knocked down before the vessels were opened; and as respiration had ceased in consequence of the injury of the brain and spinal cord, no difference of colour, of course, was perceptible between the blood from the jugular vein, and that from the carotid artery. These results, so different from what might have been expected, from the observations of Messrs. Coleman and Cooper, on the temperature of the two sides of the heart, led me to repeat their ex- periments. The experiments in which I place most confidence, were made on lambs, about four months old, and to these I shall confine myself at present. In each instance the animal was killed by the divi- sion of the great vessels of the neck; an opening was made immediately into the thorax, and a very delicate thermometer was introduced into the ven- tricles of the heart by means of a small incision. The operation occupied so short a space of time,

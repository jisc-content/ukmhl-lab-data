355 XIX. ON A NEW METHOD OF PRESERVING ANATOMICAL PREPARATIONS FOR A LIMITED TIME. During two years and half, namely, between 1825 and the latter end of 1827, as leisure and oppor- tunities permitted, I first made trial of a method of preserving anatomical preparations, which, I believe, to be new, and which I have found to possess ad- vantages, in many respects, greatly exceeding the expectations I had formed of it. Its principal advantages consist, â€” first, in its cheapness; secondly, in its durability within certain limits; and, thirdly, in the clear and instructive manner in which it displays the minute structure of many textures and compound parts. The cheapness of the method will be obvious, merely from the mention that the substance employ- ed is a solution of the sulphurous acid gas in water, and that it may be prepared in a manner, equally economical and easy, by burning sulphur over dis- tilled or rain water, in any appropriate glass vessel ;* * A tall receiver, provided with a cork, one-third full of water, A A 2

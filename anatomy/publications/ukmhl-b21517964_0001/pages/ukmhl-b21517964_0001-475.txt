455 HEART AND GREAT VESSELS. difference in the specific gravity of the descending aorta and of the vena cava corresponding, gradually diminishing with age: thus, the specific gravity of these vessels in a young man appears from his details to be, as 1060, and 1101,—the former the artery, the latter the vein; and in an old man as 1098 and 1105. This difference I have not been able to discover. Very recently, I have carefully tried the specific gravity of each vessel, belonging to a man aged 30; —the artery was 1060, the vein 1061. They were similarly treated in every respect’ preparatory to weighing. Clifton Wintringham’s results are so uniformly consistent,—they all support each other so well, and are in such perfect conformity with his conclusions, that it is rather difficult to avoid the inference that he formed an hypothesis in the first instance and then made experiments to support it,—notwithstand- ing the passage from Leibnitz inserted in the title page of his book—Ex iis^ quce experimentis con- stant, due ere tentimus quicquid potest, antequam in hypotheses liberiores expatiemur.

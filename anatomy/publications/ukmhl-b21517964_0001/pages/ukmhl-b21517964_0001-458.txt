43B FATAL CASE OF RUPTURE thigh was fractured; and on exposing the bone it proved to be so, at the neck, in an oblique direction just without the capsular ligament. Nothing mor- bid was discovered in the brain. No ribs were frac- tured. On opening the chest, a large quantity of blood was found in the left pleura, about six pints, and a small quantity in the pericardium, about an ounce. The blood was dark, of the colour of venous blood, and had separated into crassamentum and serum, and the serum was tinged red. No lesion was detected either in the right auricle or ventricle, or in the vena cava ascendens or des- cendens, or in the pulmonary artery. The left ventricle also was uninjured ; but not so the left auricle and aorta, each was ruptured. The true auricle was ruptured in two places; each opening was sufficiently large to allow the passing of the finger. The aorta was ruptured just above the mouths of the coronary arteries; and also at the upper part of its arch, a few lines inferior to the origin of the left carotid and subclavian arteries. The laceration at its base was nearly circular, and through all the coats, and were it not for a narrow strip, of about two or three lines which remained entire, the vessel had been completely torn in two ; even the external loose cellular membrane was di- vided to the extent of about half its circumference. The rupture at the arch was oblique, also through all the coats, and rather more than one half the circumference of the vessel. There was no blood

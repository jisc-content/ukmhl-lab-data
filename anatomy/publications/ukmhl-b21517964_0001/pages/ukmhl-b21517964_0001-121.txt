101 OF SOME OF THE AMPHIBIA. The kidneys of the bull-frog, on examination, were found to be apart, one on each side of the spine ;— comparatively pretty large,—very much lobulated,— of a bright red colour and rather tender. The ureters did not terminate in the bladder, but in the rectum, by two soft papillae, projecting a little, and situated between the orifice of the bladder and the anus,— nearer the former than the latter. The urinary bladder was of large dimensions, nearly globular,— semitransparent, and yet pretty strong and con- tractile, and evidently muscular. It opened into the rectum a few lines behind the anus, by a large orifice, very well adapted to receive the urine, as it flows from the ureters, when the anus is closed, as it usually is during the life of the animal, and soon after death, by its powerful sphincter muscle. The urinary organs of the brown toad resembled, in most respects, those of the green frog. In two specimens, out of many that I dissected, I found the kidneys incorporated at their upper ends. The ureters had the same termination nearly. The blad- der of urine appeared to be double; when distended fully with air, it resembled two oval bags; which, as two compartments, communicated freely just above the symphysis pubis, to which they were firmly at- tached; and they communicated also by a single orifice with the rectum. This orifice was as well suited as that of the former for the reception of the urine as it flows into the rectum. The urine of the bull-frog, taken from the bladder immediately after the death of the animal, varied a little in its appear-

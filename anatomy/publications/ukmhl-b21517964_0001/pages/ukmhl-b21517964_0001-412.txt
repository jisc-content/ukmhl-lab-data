In each of the three, however, the proportion of cal- careous matter being below the mean of all the others, is very favourable to the idea that in this disease there is actually an absorption of the earthy matter of the bones. As the manner in which the crania of the foreign races submitted to trial were prepared is not known, no satisfactory inferences can be drawn relative to the proportions of the calcareous and animal matter in them. The results are so very different, espe- cially in the African instances, that if of no other use, they are well adapted to prevent hasty gener- alization. Table II.

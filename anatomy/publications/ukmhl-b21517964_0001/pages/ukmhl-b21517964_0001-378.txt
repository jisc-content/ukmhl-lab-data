358 ON THE APPLICATION OF SULPHUROUS most, if not all, of the unpurified vegetable acids are liable, when exposed to the air. It is not owing to the mere abstraction of oxygen, for phos- phorus has not the same effect permanently, nor nitrous gas. It may be conjectured, both in the in- stance of vegetable and animal substances, that the antiseptic power of the acid depends on its effecting some new arrangements of the particles of the proxi- mate principles which render them exempt from the changes alluded to ; or on rendering inert the vegeta- ble and animal leaven which, under favourable cir- cumstances, excite these changes. The last advantage which I have mentioned, the manner in which the acid displays the minute struc- ture of many textures and compound parts, is that which I shall most dwell on, as I consider it its chief recommendation to notice. It does not, like spirits of wine and a solution of alum, contract what is im- mersed in it; it does not, like a saturated solution of common salt, or of nitre, or of any of the salts of chlorine which I have tried, after a little while, lose its transparency and become thick and turbid; nor does it, like a solution of corrosive sublimate, when used without precaution, deposit on the inside of the glass and on the preparation itself, a crust which soon becomes a complete mask. On the contrary, it expands and developes the parts, some more, some less, so as to magnify them and make them more distinct, effecting in structure what the lens does in vision ; and, at the same time, it remains clear, so

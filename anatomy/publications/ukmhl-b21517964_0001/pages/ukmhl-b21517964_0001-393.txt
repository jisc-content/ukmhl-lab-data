ACID TO ANATOMICAL PURPOSES. 373 nation be made a few hours after death, it should be immersed in a solution of chlorine in salt and water, till deprived of its putrid smell and tendency; then it may be washed clean, and put into the acid solution, without danger of spoiling. 3. Attention should be paid to the strength of the sulphurous solution, to proportion it to the nature of the part to be preserved, and the object in view in employing it. If the intention is to expand and develope the structure of the parts, for the purpose of demonstration, a strong solution answers best; if merely to preserve a part as little changed as possible, a weak solution is most successful, espe- cially if cuticle, the visible epithelium, or tendinous parts, are concerned, as a strong acid separates the former, and partially dissolves the latter. When strong acid is thus used, if it be desirable to keep the part, the structure of which has been distended, it is safest to transfer it from the acid to dilute spirit of wine, as proof spirit diluted with twice its bulk of distilled water. 4. If the object is to preserve a part for a number of years, I would recommend in every instance the transferring it from the acid to dilute spirit, such as that just mentioned ; especially if the preparation be scarce, and of value in consequence. I am in- duced to offer this suggestion from the experience which I have had during the last twelve years: during this period some preparations have been well pre-

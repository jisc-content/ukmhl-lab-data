4 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS such other alterations as any additional knowledge I have since been able to attain by my own labours, may seem to render advisable. 1.—Experiments on the Electricity of the Torpedo. From the preceding letter, it appears how desirous my brother was of trying the effect of the shock of the torpedo on a needle placed in a spiral wire. The result, he was of opinion, would be conclusive as to tbe nature of its electricity,—that is, whether it should be considered distinct, and of a peculiar kind, or merely a variety of common electricity, or at least analogous to kinds already known. Anxious to make this trial, I had an apparatus in readiness, which, with common electricity, I had found to answer extremely well. It consisted of a fine copper spiral wire, (the spring of a bracer) about one inch and a half long, and one-tenth of an inch in diameter, containing about one hundred and eighty convolutions, and weighing about four grains and a half. This was inserted into a glass tube, just large enough to receive it, and secured by corks.* The wire passed through the cork at each end, and was connected with strong wires with glass handles for the purpose of contact. The wire in- * The apparatus referred to by my brother, in his letter, did not answer so well: the spiral was of silver wire wound round a glass tube.

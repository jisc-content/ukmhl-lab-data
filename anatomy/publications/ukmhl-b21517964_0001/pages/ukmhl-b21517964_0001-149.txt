129 POISONOUS SNAKES OF CEYLON. contracted very irregularly, and so very feebly, that it had no effect in propelling its contents. The auricles were gorged with blood, particularly the right; the left ventricle was empty, and the right contained only a small quantity of blood ; the arteries and veins were full of blood, which had coagulated firmlv, even in the minute branches. There was no unusual appearance in the brain, or in any of the other viscera, excepting the distended state of their blood-vessels. A reddish sanies oozed from the wound ; the skin round it was discoloured, without swelling; the muscle under the skin was blackish and tender, as if severely bruised ; the adjoining cel- lular membrane was slightly emphysematous. Experiment 6.â€”On the following day, the snake wounded another full-grown fowl, inflicting with its fang, in the side of the face, a puncture only just per- ceptible. During the first minute and a half, the fowl did not appear to suffer in the least, when it was seized with violent convulsions, which proved fatal in about fifteen seconds. The appearances on dissection, which was com- menced immediately, were very similar to the last. The action of the heart was perhaps a little less feeble ; the vermicular motion of the intestines had not entirely ceased, and the blood was not quite so firmly coagulated. All the cavities of the heart were empty, with the exception of the right auricle, which was distended with blood. VOL. I. K

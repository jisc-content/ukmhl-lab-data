The former afforded only a small quantity of fluid ; what was first pressed out, was like thin starch in appearance; what was last expressed was gelatinous. The former, under the microscope, was found to contain many animalcules, mixed with globular particles and small masses of mucus. The latter contained very few animalcules, and consisted chiefly of mucus. The fluid from the vas deferens was very like that which flowed first */ from the vesiculae, excepting that it was without any tint of brown which that fluid possessed. Under the microscope, only one animalcule, perfect in form, could be detected; fragments of others, as it were, appeared, and some globules, and a good deal of transparent mucus in minute masses.* The fluid of the vesiculae and of the vas deferens was distinctly alkaline; each changed the colour of turmeric paper. 11.â€”Aged 27 ; died of pulmonary consumption.

VESICUL^ SEMINALES IN MAN. 339 tion, an entire animalcule, here and there, was ob- served.* The application of these facts to the pur- poses of evidence does not require any comment. In conclusion, it may not be amiss to allude to the views of Sir Everard Home on the subject of the fluid under consideration. They occur detailed at great length and in a very circumstantial manner in the fifth volume of his Lectures on Comparative Anatomy, and are well worthy of being referred to as a scientific curiosity. The opinion which Sir Everard Home there maintains is, that spermatic animalcules have no real existence; and that all inquirers who have asserted their existence, from the time of their discovery by Ham, in about l677,f to the present period, have been in egregious error, having mistaken, as he believes, filaments of mucus for entozoa, and fallen thereby into wild theories. Sir Everard Home relates particularly the grounds on which he came to this conclusion, and the very great pains he took to endeavour to arrive at the truth;—how he made a journey with his able assistant and accomplished artist, Mr. Bauer, to Paris, ex- • In Plate XIII, fig. 5, is represented the appearance of some of these entozoa, and of the particles which accompanied them in the fluid of the vesiculae, collected in November 1837, preserved in dilute spirit, nearly a year and half. t Vide Leuwenhoeck’s letter to Lord Brouncker, dated Nov. 1677, in the 12th Vol. of the Philos. Trans., in which he mentions that the discovery of spennatic animalcules in man was first made by Ham, and how he confirmed it, and discovered them also somewhat dil- ferent in form in the semen of the dog, cat, and rabbit.

16 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS with the starch, as indicated by the discoloration, was precipitated round the same wire. Even the decomposition of water has been effected, when the circle has been interrupted by four portions of the solution of common salt, contained in small tubes, with two needles in each, the needles in one connected with those in the other, and at the same time with the galvanometer, â€” a spiral holding an unmagnetised needle, and an air thermometer. And simultaneous with the chemical decomposition, the needle in the galvanometer has been moved, and the spirit in the air thermometer has been raised, and the needle in the spiral has been magnetised. Mr. Walsh, from his experiments, inferred that the two sides of the torpedo are when in action in opposite electrical states.* The results just de- scribed appear to prove that its under surface corre- sponds to the copper or negative extremity of a voltaic battery, and its upper surface to the zinc or positive extremity.f mass is formed. This I have used in my experiments; a single com- bination of copper and zinc wire, acted on by very dilute acid, occa- sions, in this compound, a precipitation of iodine. The iodine is precipitated round the negative wire, or that connected with the copper. The effect is the same, whether platina or silver is made to convey the electricity into the saline solution. The decomposition probably is the effect of the hydrogen disengaged; it is not an im- mediate electro-chemical effect. * Philosophical Transactions, Abridged, vol. xiii. p. 475. t In my first paper on the torpedo, a mistake was inadvertently made relative to the electricity of the opposite surfaces of the tor- pedo, which has been pointed out by M. Becquerel, in his very able work on electricity. i

ON THE TORPEDO. delicate plates or laminae, as shewn in fig. 2.* These characters are constant in all the different specimens which I have examined. To these two well-characterized species, it ap- pears to me, that all the varieties of the torpedo, at least those known hitherto in the Mediterranean may be referred: the T. unimaculata of Risso, and the second species of Rondelet,f to the Occhia- tella; and the varieties, with dark irregular spots, or without spots, to the Tremola. Cuvier in the last edition of his Regne Animal, and Rudolphi, have so considered the first-men- tioned variety, the T. unimaculata, as it differs only in having one eye-spot, instead of five, the most common number. But, it is not more uncommon to meet with it, having three or four spots than one; and that this is purely accidental, is proved by the circumstance that in a brood of several foetal fish, of which all but one resembled the parent in having five spots, the exception had three. The occhiatella has been seen even with seven eye-spots. The varieties of the tremola, are the T. mar- * The villi increase in size during the period of pregnancy, and then contain a large quantity of blood. In each filament in the instance of the uterus of the occhiatella there is a blood-vessel re- flected on itself, circulating blood of a bright scarlet hue; in the lamellar structure of the uterus of the tremola there is a similar ap- pearance of blood vessels in loops. t “ Secunda Torpedinis species i prima differt, quod maculas, nigras, rotundas, circuits non distinctas habeat, sed eadem pentagon! figura dispositas. Est etiam prirase concolor.”—Rondelet, p. 362.

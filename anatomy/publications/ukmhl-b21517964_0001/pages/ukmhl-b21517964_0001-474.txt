454 EXPERIMENTS ON THE RUPTURE OF THE passed: death was almost immediate, and the left auricle was found open. Chaussier, who examined the body, attributed the effect of the rupture to com- pression of the aorta by the wheel, and to over-dis- tension of the auricle with blood, the consequence of that obstruction. It is true that very many other cases of rupture of the heart are recorded,—as ac- cidents,—but they are either not sufficiently clearly described, to be depended upon, or there is reason to suppose that the heart was either crushed or else wounded, or that the part ruptured was previously diseased. The authors I have chiefly consulted have been, Senac, Morgagni, Haller, Portal, and Laennec. On the comparative strength of different vessels, besides Hale’s very ingenious work already referred to, I have consulted Clifton Wintringham’s “ Experimental Inquiry on some parts of the Ani- mal Structure,” published in 1740, a few years after the Statical Essays of the former; but although having great pretensions to accuracy in his manner of giving the details of his experiments, I must con- fess I have not been able to place sufficient con- fidence in his results to use them. In the Second Volume, a table will be found of the specific gravities of different textures, formed from experiments conducted with some care, and which I believe to be tolerably accurate. It was in comparing some of my results with his, that my faith in his correctness was shaken. According to him (to mention only one point), there is a marked

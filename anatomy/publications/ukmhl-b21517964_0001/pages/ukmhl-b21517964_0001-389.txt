ACID TO ANATOMICAL PURPOSES. 369 caution, that the acid is not fitted for preseiving them. When distended, they should be transfen ed to dilute spirit of wine. If allowed to remain in the acid, they may become softened and in a few months reduced to the state nearly of a pulp: this I have witnessed, in the respiratory and alimentary passages of small birds. For the purposes of pathological anatomy, I be- lieve the sulphurous acid will prove equally if not more useful, than for those already alluded to. I rest this opinion partly on the trials which I have made, and partly on the consideration, that, whilst its expansive power is so great on most tissues, its solvent power is very inconsiderable, and on coagu- lable lymph appears to be null, (an ingredient of the blood, which, in most morbid changes, acts so im- portant a part) ; and it appears to be null on mucous membranes, the seat of so many diseases. The spe- cimens which I have by me, of diseased parts pre- served in this acid, are satisfactory beyond my ex- pectation ; not so much as shewing the exact dis- eased appearance, such as it presented itself on dis- section, as in giving a correct notion of the nature of the lesion, by magnifying and rendering more dis- tinct the effects of the disease, contrary to what hap- pens when the morbid parts are immersed in spirits of wine.* * For the purpose of pathological research, the part to be examined may, with advantage, he immersed for a few hours in sulphurous acid, and then transferred to a cylindrical bottle, of thin and very clear VOL.

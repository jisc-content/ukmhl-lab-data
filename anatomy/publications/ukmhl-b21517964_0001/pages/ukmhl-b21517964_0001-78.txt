58 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS with a red spot in the situation of the heart (proba- bly the heart itself), communicating by red vessels in the umbilical cord with the vascular part of the egg- In the next stage in which I have observed it, it appeared as in fig. 2â€”not quite an inch long, or a quarter of an inch wide ; the ventral fins visible, and also the dorsal, and the inferior portion of the great pectoral fins ; the branchial cartilages distinct and naked, the electrical organs not having yet appeared; the external branchial filaments longer than in the preceding, but still comparatively short; some of them tipped with red blood, others carrying it. The next stage of advance I have seen, is repre- sented by fig. 3. This embryo was about one inch and one-tenth long, and four-tenths of an inch wide where widest, and it weighed just five grains. Its electrical organs were beginning to appear. The external branchial filaments were about six-tenths of an inch long, and contained red blood. The heart was distinct and large, as were also the two lobes of the liver. The stomach was small, apparently empty, smaller than the intestine. The intestine was large and white. The vitello-intestinal canal was distinct; it appeared as a very slender thread, connected with the upper part of the intestine, and like the intestine itself it contained no yolk.

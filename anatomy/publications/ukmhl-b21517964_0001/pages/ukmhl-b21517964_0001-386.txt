366 ON THE APPLICATION OF SULPHUROUS Relative to the other mucous membranes, I may briefly mention, that this acid shews them equally as well as the primse vise, and enables one equally well to notice how they differ from each other. I shall now proceed to some other parts. By rendering the fibrous neurilema, and the connecting cellular tissue, semi-transparent, and by expanding these textures, the sulphurous acid has a remarkable effect in displaying the nerves, with the exception of the ganglionic. It shews, almost without dissec- tion, and still better when aided by dissection, which it facilitates, the parts of each fasciculus of nerves and their junctions; and, if the nerve be cut, the proportion of the medullary matter which it con- tains, which becomes projecting, squeezed out, owing to the pressure just alluded to. It shews very distinctly the fibrous nature of the optic nerves beyond their junction; but, at their junction, and towards their thalami, their substance appears to be exactly similar to the common medullary substance of the cerebrum. It shews the papillae of the tongue to be each the termination of a minute nerve, and this without the aid of a magnifying glass. It de- monstrates how, as the nerves proceed from their source, the proportion of medullary matter dimi- nishes, and the thickness of their sheath increases; and this very remarkably in the nerves of the fingers. On the ganglionic nerves, judging from the very few trials which I have yet made, it appears to have but little effect, as if their composition were different

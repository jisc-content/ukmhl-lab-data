304 PECULIARITY OF STRUCTURE OCCURRING In one instance of the total seventeen, a short filament proceeded from the intersecting band (vide Plate xiii. fig. 3), its end floating loosely. In two cases out of ninety-eight, there was another peculiarity, which I am not aware has ever been noticed, viz.,—an opening or foramen between the two vertebral arteries, in the septum formed by their juxtaposition posterior to the basilar artery. In each instance it‘was sufficiently large to admit a surgeon’s probe.—(vide Plate xiii. fig. 4.) In three instances amongst the total number, each vertebral was as large as the basilar artery,—which was of the usual size of this artery; and the verte- brals did not appear to be diseased. The proportion in which the left vertebral artery was found larger than the right, is so great, viz.,— in the ratio of 26 to 8, that it can hardly be con- sidered accidental. But, on what the circumstance depends, I am entirely ignorant. At one time, I supposed that it might be connected with the differ- ence of origin of the right and left subclavian ; but, the notion was not supported by facts. In two in- stances (the only ones observed) in which the left vertebral took its origin immediately from the aorta, between the carotid and subclavian, it was smaller than the right.vertebral, taking its origin from the subclavian of that side,—and that subclavian, as usual, from the arteria innominata. In the Table, I have given the results of my observations, monthly, for a particular reason.

It has not come to my knowledge that any precise thermometrical observations have hitherto been made on the human body after death. I was induced to pay attention to the subject, from having, in one instance, whilst engaged in conducting a post mortem exami- nation, found the deeply seated parts of a degree of temperature uncommonly elevated. As the inquiry needs as much accuracy as possible, I shall first re- late the simple facts, and afteiAvards offer some reflections on them.

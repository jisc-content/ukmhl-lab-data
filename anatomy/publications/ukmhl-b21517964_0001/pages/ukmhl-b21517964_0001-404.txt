384 XXL EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS ON THE PROPOR- TIONAL QUANTITY OF ANIMAL AND CALCAREOUS MATTER IN THE BONES OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS. At distant intervals, my attention has been directed to the comparative composition of bone. The re- sults which I have obtained, I shall now bring for- ward. Although they are far less numerous than I could wish, and too few for full and satisfactory comparison and induction, yet, I am not without hope, that as a contribution they may conduce to these ends. The trials which I have instituted, have been of a simple kind, with a view to determine principally the proportion of calcareous and animal matter ; and this has been effected by calcination, or exposure to the action of fire in a crucible until the whole of the animal matter was consumed. For the sake of brevity, I shall give the results in the form of Tables, and I shall include in them the earliest which I obtained so long ago as 1811, and

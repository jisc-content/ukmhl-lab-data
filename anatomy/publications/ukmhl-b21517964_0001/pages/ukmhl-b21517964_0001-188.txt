TEMPERATURE OF MAN 168 elevated as it is above the level of the sea, and sur- rounded by mountains, is subject to considerable vicissitudes of temperature in the course of the day, and, consequently, is a place well adapted for mak- ing observations on the effects of these vicissitudes on animal heat. In fine weather the temperature of the air, at sun-rise, is always below 70°, and I have seen it as low as 55°; and in the afternoon, in such weather, it is always above 76°, and frequently as high as 83°. On the 18th of January, 1818, a favourable day, I tried the temperature of an individual, at different hours, and obtained the following results. Hour. Temp, of Temp, under Sensation. Air. Tongue. 6 a.m. 60-5 98° Cool. 9 66° 97-5 Cold. 1 P.M. 78° 98-5 Cool. 4 79° 98-5 Warm. 6 71° 99° Warm. 11 69° 98° Cool. It may be proper to mention how the individual passed the day. He rose at six a.m. ; read till nine A.M.; breakfasted temperately at ten ; was engaged in some chemical experiments from half-past ten to two p.M.; from two p.m. to five was employed chiefly in reading; from five to six took gentle horse exercise ; dined sparingly between seven and eight;

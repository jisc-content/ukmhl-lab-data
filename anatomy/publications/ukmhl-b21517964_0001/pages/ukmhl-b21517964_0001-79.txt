ON THE TORPEDO. 59 was full of a similar fluid. The roots of the elec- trical nerves were visible, but no brain. The next stage in which I have observed the embryo is represented by fig. 4. It was advanced only a little beyond the preceding ; the principal differences were in the electrical organs being a little longer, the branchial filaments considerably longer (about an inch long), and the brain and spinal cord apparent. In the next stage in which I have seen it, as represented by figure 5, there was a very consider- able advance. The foetus was about two inches and a half long, and one inch and three quarters wide. The electrical organs were distinct, the pectoral fins entire, the external branchial filaments very long. The stomach was still small and empty, whilst the intestine was distended with yolk. The external yolk was covered with a vascular mem- brane, and not partially as in the preceding, but entirely. The vitello-intestinal canal freely com- municated with the intestine, and was yet very little enlarged where it joins itself to the intestine at the commencement of its vascular portion. The next stages, which have come under my observation are represented by fig. 1 and 2, Plate IV. and fig. 1, Plate V. The cavity of the ab- domen is shewn laid open in the two former, to exhibit the external yolk in progress of diminution, and the internal yolk contained in a membranous ba", as it were a lateral extension of the vitello- O'

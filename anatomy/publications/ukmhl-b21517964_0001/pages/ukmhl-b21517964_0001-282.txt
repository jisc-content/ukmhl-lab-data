TWO CASES OF 2(â€˜)2 It has been asserted lately, that air thus found is, in every instance, the consequence of putrefaction. But surely the accurate Morgagni was not so egre- giously deceived. Many times, I have noticed air in the vessels of the pia mater, in bodies only a few hours dead ; and very lately I detected some in the internal jugular vein of a body that had been dead only 18 hours, and free from every mark of incipient putrefaction ; and I lay the more stress on this observation, because it was very carefully made, before any large vessel was divided through which air could gain admission. Further, air seems to pass pretty readily from the air-cells of the lungs into the pleura. Is not this proved by an experiment of Hales ?* And an experiment which I have made, carbonic acid; because the serum of the blood is capable of absorbing carbonic acid gas, rather more even than water, as I have ascertained by experiment; because, during the coagulation of blood sponta- neously, and the coagulation of serum by heat, I have never observed carbonic acid gas to be disengaged, when the experiments w^ere properly made in vessels to which air could not have access, as in tubes completely filled with blood or serum, and inverted in blood or Mercury; and lastly because I have not been able to procure car- bonic acid gas from blood just drawn from the vessels, and still wann, when placed under a receiver and completely exhausted of air. I may here remark, that I have made two experiments on blood in vacuo, and in both with the same negative results. In one instance the arterial blood of an ox was employed; in the other, the blood of a man in health. In the former, eight ounces were used; in the latter, one ounce. In both instances, the blood remained perfectly tranquil, when the vacuum was as complete as could be made with a good air-pump, and of course did not exhibit the slightest traces of the disengagement of any air. * Vide Stat.

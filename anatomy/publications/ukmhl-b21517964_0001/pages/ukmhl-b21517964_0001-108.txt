88 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS glandules are all of comparatively large dimensions. They vary, however, in size; there are at least three or four different orders of them. The largest are longest, and convey the secretion furthest from its source. They are all transparent; they contract very much when immersed in boiling water, and do not immediate- ly become gelatinous like the skin. They have gene- rally each a simple minute orifice : I have occa- sionally found them having two. The mucus which they convey is in appearance not unlike the matter of the vitreous humour of the eye. It dissolves completely and rapidly in boiling water. The alimentary canal of the torpedo may be divided into six parts:—1st, the mouth and pha- rynx, in which there is no tongue, even rudimentary; the latter perforated by the two temporal apertures : —2dly, the oesophagus, lined with a distinct epi- thelium, longitudinally plicated and communicating with the branchiae laterally by five apertures on each side :—3dly, the stomach, thickly membranous, and irregularly rugose; without any apparent epi- thelium, or any visible villi:—4thly, the first division of intestine, corresponding to the duodenum, short, irregularly valvular, and villous, communicating with the liver and pancreas by their respective ducts: —5thly, the second division of intestine, regularly and amply valvular, the valvulae villous ;* and lastly * The valvulae are composed of eleven transverse plates, with a central aperture in each, without which every j)air but the first and last would form a closed cell. The first and last plate correspond only

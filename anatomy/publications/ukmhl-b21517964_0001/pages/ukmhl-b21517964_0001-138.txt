118 EFFECTS OF THE POISON OF flowed. The cock became instantly lame, and in less than a minute was unable to stand. In about five minutes, his respiration became hurried and rather laborious; some alvine dejections took place. In about ten minutes he appeared to be in a coma- tose state; and for about five minutes he continued in this state,—his respiration gradually becoming more feeble and laboured. In seventeen minutes, when his breathing was hardly perceptible, he was seized with a convulsive fit, which, in the course of the next minute, returned four or five times, each less violent than the former,—and the last proved fatal. The heart was immediately exposed: the auricles were found still acting. The lungs were redder than usual, and turgid with blood and serum. The brain, carefully examined, displayed no morbid appearance. The thigh bitten was slightly swollen; the skin sur- rounding the wound and the subjacent muscle were livid. Experiment 6.—On the 29th of October, 1816, at Colombo, I assisted my friend, Mr. Finlayson, in examining a small hooded snake about two feet long, very soon after it was killed. We opened the poison- bag and tried the effects of its poison on a wild dove. First, a little of it was applied to the conjunctiva of the eye.

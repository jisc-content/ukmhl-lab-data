EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 62 The facts I have stated relative to the develop- ment of the foetus of the torpedo, though amply sufficient to demonstrate that this fish is not ovi- parous, are not incompatible with its being ovi- viviparoLis, as it is considered by the naturalists who have paid most attention to the subject. Yet 1 believe it is not strictly so, and that it is more correct to say that it is intermediate between ovi-viviparous, and viviparous; the foetus, as I be- lieve, deriving its support in part from the ovum, and in part from the parent. The principal fact on which I found this belief is, that the mature foetus is very much heavier than the egg. In the three following tables, I shall give the statical results, substantiating this fact. The first table will relate to the ovum just after it has entered the uterine cavity, or before the appear- ance of the embryo; the second to the ovum after the foetal development has commenced, but has made little progress; and the third to the foetus when mature or nearly mature, indicated by the total disappearance of the external yolk, or its being reduced externally to a very small bulk. In noticing the kind of torpedo, I shall use the popular names lithic acid in its urine. The kidneys of this fish were large, and much lobulated; it had an oval urinary bladder, in which the ureters terminated, and the bladder itself communicated with the anus by a membranous urethra, the mouth of which was covered with a valvu- lar membrane. The urine was liquid; the litliic acid in minute quantity, and was discovered after evaporation by the test of nitric acid.

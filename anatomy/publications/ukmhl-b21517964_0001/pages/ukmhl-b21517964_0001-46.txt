2() EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS it is conjectured, that the mucus with which tlie torpedo is lubricated, may be a conducting medium between the two opposite surfaces. This was an erroneous view. It may serve that purpose to the surfaces individually. Seeing the error theoretically, I was led to examine the margin of the fins, and they have appeared to me to have less mucus ad- hering to them than any other parts of the fish, as if intended partially to insulate the electrical organs. In that communication also, I stated my inability to account for my brotherâ€™s not obtaining any positive results in his experiments on the torpedo. After reconsidering the subject, I am disposed to think it might have been owing to his using large fish, without the means of ascertaining their electrical activity, excepting by the shock. And, we have seen, that when the human body forms part of the circle of communication with a galvanometer, the latter is not affected in the passage of the electricity pro- ducing the shock; which may serve to explain his not having witnessed any effect on the instrument at Trieste. As regards the electrical energies of large torpedos, nothing is more uncertain. There appears to be no relation between the muscular and elec- trical power. I have seen strong vivacious fishes, which made great muscular exertions in the water, almost or entirely destitute of electrical power; and, on the contrary, I have seen others languid and moribund, which have exerted considerable elec-

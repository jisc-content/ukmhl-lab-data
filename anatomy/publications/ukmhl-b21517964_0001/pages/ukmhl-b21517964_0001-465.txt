HEART AND GREAT VESSELS. 445 and its main ascending branches, injected water by one of the pulmonary veins, the others being left untied. The left auricle became exceedingly dis- tended, and the coronary arteries. The ventricle and aorta were less distended. The lungs were very much distended, and there was an oozing of water from their surface; when a portion was pressed gently between the hands, the water actually dropt from it, and yet the investing pleura, appeared to retain its integrity. After employing much force, a rupture was with some difficulty effected. The water rushed out through the trachea, indicating the bursting of a pulmonary vein in the substance of the lung.* Experiment 9- f Next secured by ligature the pulmonary veins, * It was curious to see in this instance, how the lining membrane of the left side of the heart, and of the aorta, above the ligature, were intensely stained red; whilst the portion of the latter below it, Avas colourless; affording strong proof^of the dyeing power of the colouring matter of the blood (the left side of the heart con- tained some blood) when in solution. t Previous to commencing this experiment, a small opening was made in the pericardium, and the contained fluid was carefully re- moved by means of a sponge, and then the opening was closed by a ligature. At the end of the experiment, it was re-opened and ex- amined ; notwithstanding the distended state of the auricle and ven- tricle, and of the coronary arteries, and that nearly half an hour was passed in making the trial, owing to delays, not more than three or four drops of water were found collected, the result of exudation. This result may he adduced as a confirmation of the conclusion arrived at, page 239, Vol. II., relative to the source of the fluid so frequently found in the pericardium after death.

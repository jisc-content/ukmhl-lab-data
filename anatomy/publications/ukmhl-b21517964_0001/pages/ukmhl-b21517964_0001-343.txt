323 VESrCUL.® SEMINALES OF MAN. pleurae, participated in the disease. During life it had not been suspected. The left femoral and the right iliac and femoral veins, were obstructed with coagula, which in the inferior parts consisted of crassamentum, and in the superior of fibrin. In the upper part of each vein the fibrinous concretion contained a cavity in which was a semifluid, having a good deal the character of purulent matter, and which would commonly be called purulent matter.* The lower extremities were oedematous, the right more than the left,—but even the right extremity only in a moderate degree. There was little hair on the pubis, or on the chin; the partes naturales were all small; the larynx was small; the skin delicate. According to his comrades, he had always shown an aversion to the sex. A very minute portion of fluid only could be pro- cured from the vasa deferentia, which, under the microscope, exhibited numerous small particles, and a few larger globules,—but no spermatic animalcules. The fluid of the vesiculse was also small in quantity and destitute of animalcules. It was of a light-brownish * It sustained this character subjected to the best tests: Thus, agitated with water, a white matter subsided, very little prone to putrefaction, iridescent when held before a light, globular under the microscope. The differences were rather in degree than kind, indi- cating, as it were, if the expression may be used, an imperfect puru- lent matter; thus, it putrified more readily than purulent matter; was only just perceptibly iridescent, and its particles were more irre- gularly globular and less compact. The mode of formation of this kind of fluid, with which pathologists are now tolerably familiar, is a curious problem, and deeply interesting in many of its relations. Y 2

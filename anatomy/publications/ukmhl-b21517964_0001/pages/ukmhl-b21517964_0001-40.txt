EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 20 with cotton thread, all the effects of the fish, as might be expected, were witnessed, as if these imperfect conductors had not intervened ; the shock was felt by the hands holding the wires, needles in the spirals were magnetised, and the multiplier was moved. When a cotton thread, soaked in salt water, or in a strong solution of salt, was interposed beyond the contact-wires, both the power of affecting the multi- plier and of giving polarity to the needle in the spiral, was arrested ; and this was uniformly the result in a considerable number of experiments made with three different fishes, of which two were very active, and with perfect conductors free from this interruption, produced both effects readily. But the power of giving a shock was not equally arrested ; for on removing the multiplier and spirals, and hold- ing with the wet fingers the wires attached to the moist cotton thread, the shock was several times dis- tinctly felt on stimulating the fish. The space of cotton thread between the wires was about one-tenth of an inch, and to secure its perfect humidity or wetness, it was enclosed in a glass tube, with corks at each end, through which the wires passed. When the apparatus, already described in noticing the chemical effects of the torpedo, was substituted for the wet cotton thread, the tubes being filled with a strong solution of salt, the multiplier was affected, and gas was given off at each of the points of the gold wires; and when steel needles were used,

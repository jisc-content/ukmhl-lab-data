IN THE BASILAR ARTERY OF MAN. 307 any particular family or race; they were men of different regiments, English, Irish, Scotch, brought to the general hospital, the invaliding station of the army, from different parts of the globe, in a manner approaching to the accidental as nearly as possible. I am disposed to believe, that were the patho- logical anatomist engaged in extensive and minute research, to institute a series of observations on organic changes, analogous to that which Sydenham conducted on ordinary maladies, he might arrive at the conclusion, that there are organic constitutions prevalent at times, not less than atmospheric, and which (however produced) may be as much con- cerned in the origin of chronic disease, as the at- mospheric influences are in the acute. I shall give in a tabular form some of the results of my experience bearing on this subject, drawn from my notes of the various post-mortem examina- tions which I have attended, during a period of nearly eighteen years, namely, from May, 1821, when I commenced the practice of making a note of every fatal case, in which there was an examina- tion of the body after death. My experience has been chiefly confined to our military hospitals, indeed at home it has been entirely so restricted ; on foreign stations, it extended to the native population, espe- cially in Malta, where the civil hospital offers an ample field for research.

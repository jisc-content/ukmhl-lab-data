292 EFFECTS OF THE SUN’s RAYS when the sky was imclouded, and the temperature, in the shade, about 80°. Immediately after this exposure, the tanned part was browner than before, and the adjoining white part, now exposed for the first time, was slightly red. On the 19th, the tan- ned part was distinctly browner and redder, a very little warmer than natural, and very slightly tender. The adjoining part was florid red, slightly painful, and hot. On the 23d, the tanned part was merely brown, a shade darker than before, while the ad- joining part was undergoing desquamation, and beginning to lose its vivid inflammatory hue. And, farther, in confirmation, I may relate, that I have been at some pains to learn from natives of the Ionian Islands, especially of the lower classes, who are very much in the open air, what effect they have experienced from the sun’s action. The result of my inquiry is, that very few of them have ever experienced the blistering or scorching effect of the sun ; and when they have experienced it, it has commonly been on a part of the body not accus- tomed to be exposed to light; and on some occa- sion of unusual exposure, as that of bathing in the open sea. From all which, may it not be inferred, that the sun acts both indirectly, by the medium of inflammation, in changing the colour of the skin, and directly, without the intervention of inflamma- tion, in producing the same effect, or in heightening it when produced ?

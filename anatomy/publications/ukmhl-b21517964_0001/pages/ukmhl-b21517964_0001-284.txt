TWO CASES OF 264 part of the nitrous gas was found to be absorbed ; the pleura was free from inflammation, the substance of the lungs very slightly inflamed, and the blood exhibited a brownish hue. From these circumstances it may be conjectured that nitrous gas produces its deleterious effects, after it has been absorbed, either by acting on the blood immediately, or on the air- cells of the lungs and the blood conjointly, when converted into nitrous acid in the course of the pul- monary circulation. On the admission of nitrous oxide into the pleura, I have made one experiment only. About 30 cubic inches of this gas, contaminated with 25 per cent, common air, were passed into the pleura of a dog. The animal exhibited no uneasy feeling, and imme- diately after appeared to be rather exhilarated. It continued apparently in good health for 24 hours, when it was killed. Five cubic inches of air were procured from the pleura, which consisted of 10 per cent, oxygen, and 90 azote, being quite deprived of nitrous oxide. The pleura and lung exhibited no unusual appearances which could be referred to the gas absorbed. Mr. Abernethy, in his ingenious essay on the Func- tions of the Skin, has proved that that texture is possessed of a power of absorbing and exhaling certain gases, which it exercises according to laws peculiar to the animal economy.* The preceding experi- Surgical and Physiological Essays, Part 2, by John Abernethy.

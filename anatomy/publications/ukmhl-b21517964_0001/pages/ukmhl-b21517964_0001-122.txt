]02 URINARY ORGANS AND SECRETION ance in different instances, and very considerably in quantity, the bladder being sometimes full almost to distension, and at other times quite empty. The following is a description of a quantity of urine which amounted to 300 grains, and which was col- lected from thirty-six frogs of different sizes. It w^as almost transparent and like water in ap- pearance. It was insipid, but was not without smell; the odour from it was not unlike that of the serum of blood. It was of specific gravity 1003. It had no effect on litmus or turmeric paper. Slowly evaporated, it afforded a minute quantity of brownish extract, which had the smell of urea before it is purified. This deliquesced on exposure to the air. Decomposed by heat in a small glass tube, it yielded a little amber-coloured fluid and strong ammoniacal fumes, and a residual coal, in which w^as detected a large proportion of common salt and a little phosphate of lime. Another specimen of the urine of these frogs was found to be more dilute; it contained a minute por- tion of common salt and of phosphate of lime, with- out any appreciable quantity of urea. The urine of the brown toad was pretty uniform in its appearance in different instances; and in its composition also, judging from the results of the experiments made on it. From the bladders of eighty-four toads, 732 grains of urine were collected. Examined when quite fresh, it was nearly trans- })arent, and would have been perfectly so, but for a

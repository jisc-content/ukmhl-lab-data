49 ON THE TORPEDO. sing I have offered on the subserviency of the elec- tricity of the torpedo in an auxiliary manner to digestion, respiration, and the secretion of mucus, I may remark that its chief use appears to be for purposes of defenceâ€”to guard it from its enemies, rather than to enable it, according to vulgar opinion, to destroy its prey, and provide itself with food. Small smelts, which were kept in the same vessel with torpedos, appeared to have no dread of them, and I believe they fed on their mucus. And, in an experi- ment in which, in a confined space, an active tor- pedo was excited to give shocks, a smelt which was with it was evidently alarmed, and once or twice exposed to the shock, leapt nearly out of the vessel; but was not injured by the electricity. In confirma- tion, I may add that the electric power of the young fish, which most requires it for its protection, is, as already observed, proportionally very much greater than that of the old, and can be excited without exhaustion and loss of life, much more frequently. After a very few shocks, most of the old fish which I have had have become languid, and have died in a few hours; whilst young ones from three to six inches long have remained active during ten or fif- teen days, and have never failed to shew the effects I have described.

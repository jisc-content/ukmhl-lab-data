154 ACCOUNT OF EXPERIMENTS the capacity of arterial blood for heat is greater than that of venous, that there is no difference of temperature between the two ventricles of the heart, and in fact that the heat of all parts is nearly the same. They are more agreeable to, and even support the hypothesis of Dr. Black, that animal heat is pro- duced in the lungs, and distributed over the whole system by means of the arterial blood. Neither are they inconsistent with that hypothesis which considers the production of animal heat as dependent on the energy of the nervous system, and arising from all the vital actions constantly occurring. Besides the results of the preceding experiments, many arguments may be advanced in opposition to Dr. Crawfordâ€™s hypothesis. As we never perceive a difference of capacity in bodies without a difference of form or composition; and as very slight differences of the former result only from great changes of the latter, it might be expected a priori^ as no difference excepting that of colour has been detected between venous and arterial blood, that their specific caloric would be very similar. From analogy also it might have been expected that the capacity of arterial blood for heat would be much less than that of water, as water appears to exceed almost every other fluid, and as the capacity appears to diminish as the inflam- mability of compounds increases. But the strongest

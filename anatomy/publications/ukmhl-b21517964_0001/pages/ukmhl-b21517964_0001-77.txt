57 ON THE TORPEDO. they break to enter the infundibulum. In the ute- rine cavity they are destitute of white; they are covered, before the appearance of the embryo, with a most delicate membrane or pellicle, and consist entirely of yolk. The number of eggs varies very much with the size of the fish; and in the smallest pregnant fish that I have examined, I have never found less than four in the two cavities, and in the largest not more than seventeen. Their size, too, varies ; their average weight is about 182 grains; the largest of eighteen eggs which I have weighed, taken from five different fish before the embryo appeared, was equal to 210 grains. Though with- out a distinct white, there is with them in the uterine cavity, common to all of them, a little ffuid generally milky, more rarely glairy, and sometimes bloody, which affords crystals of common salt on evaporation, and a very little animal matter, composed chieffy of albumen. In describing the foetal development of the tor- pedo, I shall confine myself strictly to what I have actually observed. In the first stage in which I have witnessed the embryo, it appeared as represented in Plate III. fig. I, about seven-tenths of an inch long, without fins, or electrical organs, or any distinct appearance of eyes, with very short external bran- chial filaments,* not yet conveying red blood, and * These filaments, variable in length and appearance, are constant in containing each a blood vessel which makes the circuit of the filament.

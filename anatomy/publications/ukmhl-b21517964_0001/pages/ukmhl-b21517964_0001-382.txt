362 ON THE APPLICATION OF SULPHUROUS it does not appear to dissolve them in the slightest degree, but it distends them; renders them firm; and shews their peculiar structure in a striking man- ner. As an example, I shall give a brief sketch of the primae viae. First, I may premise, that it displays the cuticle or epithelium, terminating abruptly in the oesopha- gus, just above the entrance of the latter into the stomach, and in the rectum, just within the circle of the anus, or the upper boundary of the sphincter muscle. In both, the termination is distinct, and abrupt, and unquestionable, as it appears in a pre- paration now before me.* When the epithelium is removed, (and it is most easily, either by placing it under a stream of w^ater, or by the friction of the fingers), and the mucous coat is brought distinctly into view, in the upper part of the oesophagus it appears very thin, provided with many and pretty large mucous follicles on each side, and several minute branches of nerves. With a magnifying glass of ordinary power, it seems to contain a most delicate tissue of white lines, running chiefly longitudinally, branching off* slightly â€¢ It appears very questionable, that the stomach and intestines generally, the gall-bladder and the biliary ducts, the urinary, semi- nal and the air passages, possess an epithelium analogous to cuticle and a continuation of it. All these parts must necessarily have a lining membrane, which seems to be their mucous coat, in each part somewhat different. It has been supposed that the mucus secreted by the membrane serves in lieu of cuticle, and it seems to be a probable conjecture.

VOL. 1. M Kil VIII. OBSERVATIONS ON THE TEMPERATURE OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS.* In this place I shall give the results of some in- quiries, which, chiefly between 1816 and 1820, I instituted on the temperature of man and other ani- mals,â€”a subject, in a physiological, and in relation to man, in a pathological point of view, deserving, I believe, of more minute attention than, to the best of my knowledge, it had then received. 1st. I shall describe the observations I have col- lected, to ascertain the variation of temperature to which man is liable, in passing from the temperate into the torrid zone ; in descending from a cool moun- tainous district into a hot low country ; and in inhabit- ing a region where the diurnal vicissitudes of tern- perature are considerable. 2dly. I shall give an account of the attempts I have made to ascertain the temperature of different races of men. * The observations of an earlier date than 1820, were first pub- lished in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal for Januaiy, 1820.

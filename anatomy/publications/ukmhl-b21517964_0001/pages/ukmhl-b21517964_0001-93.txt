73 ON THE TORPEDO. period, and as well as I could judge, in a very regular manner, supposing, when first extracted, that in all the internal yolk was nearly of the same size. Fig. 1. Plate VI. shews the diminution it had undergone on 22(1 May, when the three residual fish died, apparently from the carelessness of a servant, giving them turbid salt-water and weaker in salt than they had been accustomed to. During the whole of this period of five months and more, they ate nothing, though very small fish both dead and alive were put into the water. They retained, and indeed increased in, activity, and even in their electrical energies, of which I made occa- sional trials. They also became of rather firmer consistence, and of a darker colour, and perhaps contracted a little in dimensions. The weighing of those first killed was neglected; of the three which died last, two (males) weighed 510grs. each; the other (a female) 5G0grs. Their stomachs were pretty largely developed, but empty ; in the intestine there was a small quantity of yolk remaining, coloured greenish-yellow in the inferior part from the admixture of bile.* All these facts seem to shew a very slow development, and are in accordance with a long period of utero-gestation;—and I may add in favour of the same, that the ova in the ovaria * I have never found the stomach of the foetal fish, or of those fish which were so long without eating, softened or corroded,—a change which I have several times observed in the stomach of the adult fish, killed when there was food in it in process of digestion.

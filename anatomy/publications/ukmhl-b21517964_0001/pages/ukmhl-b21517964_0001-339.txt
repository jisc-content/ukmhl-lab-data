VESICUL^ SEMINALES OF MAN. 319 tended with fluid, of a light brownish hue, slightly turbid and opaque. It abounded in well-formed spermatic animalcules, and contained a few blood corpuscles, or particles extremely like them. It had no effect either on turmeric or litmus paper. An extremely small portion of fluid was obtained from one of the vasa deferentia, which, in appearance, was very like that of the vesiculse. Under the mi- croscope, a few animalcules were seen in it, many blood corpuscles and some smaller particles. 8. —Aged 32 ; died of bronchitis, complicated with hepatization of the right lung, and an aneurism of the arch of the aorta pressing on the trachea. The dissectionw^as made thirty-two hours after death. The body was not emaciated. The bronchia were nearly filled with muco-purulent matter. The right lung weighed three pounds; the greater part of it was hepatized in different degrees, and it contained a few clusters of granular tubercles. No well-marked lesion could be discovered in the abdominal viscera. The vesiculse were moderately distended with fluid of purulent-like appearance, which abounded in semi- nal animalcules. The fluid obtained from one of the vasa deferentia, extremely minute in quantity, was found to contain a few animalcules, and very many particles smaller than those of the blood. 9. —Aged 33; died of pulmonary consumption. The dissection w^as made fifteen hours after death. The body was sub-emaciated. Besides numerous tubercles in different stages of progress and several

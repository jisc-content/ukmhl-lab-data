It would appear from the information afforded by this gentleman,—• that his patient Thomas Grainger, an invalided artillery man, re- ceived a slight contusion on the dorsum of the left foot at the Cape of Good Hope in 1806; that after apparent recovery, ulcers of a severe and intractable kind formed about the left ankle, for which he was sent home and discharged the servdce; that after deriving benefit from change of climate,—he had a febrile attack in 1815, followed, whilst he was a patient in St. Thomas’s Hospital, by swelling and ulceration of the foot; and with which he was dis- charged, the disease being considered incurable. In 1834, when Mr. Shelly first saw him, the leg had acquired an enormous size, and was discharging a very offensive sanies. He then objected to an operation. Ulceration continued and increased, the bones of the toes, it is stated, becoming carious and gradually disappearing. Life being in danger from the state of the limb, and from the hemorrhage which occasionally took place from the ulcerated parts, in the last week of August, 1838, he submitted to the operation of amputation.

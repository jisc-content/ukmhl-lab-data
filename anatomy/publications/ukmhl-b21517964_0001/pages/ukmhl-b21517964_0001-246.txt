226 TEMPERATURE OF FISHES generally, and of many birds, would lead to the inference, that the nerves in the instance under con- sideration, rather than the ganglia are chiefly in- strumental, and that the latter are in some way sub- servient to the former,—but whether for giving sen- sation to the branchia, or for imparting extraordinary secreting power, so as to change the blood, or for some other purpose, remains to be ascertained. In conclusion, I would beg to state some deside- rata,—points, connected with the subject of these warm-blooded fishes, which may be considered as de- serving of further inquiry. 1. The exact temperature of different species of the Tunny family. 2. The temperature of the blood, coming from and returning to the gills. 3. The specific gravity of the blood of these fishes; and the proportion of serum, fibrin, and of red particles which it contains. 4. The minute peculiarities of their structure. 5. The peculiarities of their habits. It seems not improbable, that the investigation, if followed up, may not only throw light on the function Trans, for 1825, p. 257.) has endeavoured to associate the produc- tion of animal heat directly with ganglia; but the instances he has adduced seem liable to great objection; and the fact, that the great sympathetic nerve in birds is comparatively little developed, even less than in some reptiles, and destitute of large central ganglia, such as the semilunar ganglion in the mammalia (at least in every instance I have carefully sought for them, I have been unsuccessful) seems fatal to his hypothesis.

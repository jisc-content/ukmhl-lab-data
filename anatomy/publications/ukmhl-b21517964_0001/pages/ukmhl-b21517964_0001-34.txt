EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 14 troduced into it, through a perforated glass stopple, and they were cemented with sealing-wax along their whole course in the vessel, excepting at their points. By means of this little apparatus, I first tried the effect of a small active fish on a strong solution of common salt; the terminal wires were of silver. The contacts were made on the upper and under surface of the fish in the usual manner; minute bubbles of air collected round the point communicating with the under wire, but none at the other point. After an interval of some hours, fine gold wires were substituted for the silver wires: now gas was evolved from each extremity, but in largest proportion and in smallest bubbles, from the point connected with the under wire. The next experiment was made on a strong solution of nitrate of silver; the terminal wires were of gold, the effect was distinct; the extremity of the under gold wire became black, and only tw'o or three bubbles of air arose from it; the ex- tremity of the upper gold wire remained bright, and it was surrounded with many bubbles of air. A similar experiment w^as made on a strong solu- tion of superacetate of lead, and with results which were similar; but the effects appeared to be pro- duced with greater difficulty; they were not dis- tinct till the fish had been much irritated and seemed to put forth all its energy. These electro-chemical experiments on the tor- pedo, were some of the earliest which I instituted on

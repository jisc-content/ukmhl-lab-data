103 OF SOME OF THE AMPHIBIA. few minute flocculi suspended in it. It was of a pretty bright straw-yellow, very like healthy human urine in appearance, with the peculiar smell, and nearly the same taste in a slight degree. It was of specific gravity 1008. It did not alter litmus or turmeric paper. Nitrate of silver dropped into it produced a very copious precipitate of luna cornea. A solution of corrosive sublimate occasioned a minute flocculent precipitate; neutral acetate of lead, a copious white precipitate. Aqua ammonioe had no effect; oxalate of ammonia produced a slight cloudiness; and a faint cloudiness was produced by muriate of barytes, which did not disappear on the addition of a drop of nitric acid. A portion of this urine slowly evaporated, afforded a brown extract, with a strong urinous smell. To the moiety of this extract of a syrupy consistence, a drop of nitric acid was added; the effect produced was just the same as if concentrated human urine had been the subject of the experiment; a crystalline compound imme- diately formed, which I could not hesitate in pro- nouncing nitrate of urea. The other moiety, decom- posed by heat in a glass tube closed at one end, afforded a considerable quantity of yellow oily fluid, strongly impregnated with carbonate of ammonia, and a residual coal, from which was obtained a large proportion of common salt, and a little phosphate of lime, and slight traces of a fixed alkaline phosphate. Another portion of this urine was set aside to undergo spontaneous decomposition. After having been kept

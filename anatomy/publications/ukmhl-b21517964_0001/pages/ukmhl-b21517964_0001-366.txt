346 AQUA BINELLI, was probably prepared by the distillation of water from petroleum or some kind of tar. I next made trial of it as a styptic. I scratched the back of the hand with a lancet till the blood flowed; the water, applied to the scratch, rather increased the bleeding than stopped it. The fol- lowing morning the razor inflicted a slight cut; the Aqua Binelli was again applied, and the result was the same. These few and simple trials were made in January, 1831, just after I received the water, and they, of course, convinced me that the thing was an imposi- tion on the public, and deserving of no further in- vestigation. About two years after, my attention was recalled to the subject by a medical practitioner of Malta, who had studied at Naples, inviting me, with others, to witness the effects of a preparation made in imitation of the Aqua Binelli, and which, he maintained, was identical with it in composition and virtues. The experiment he invited us to witness appeared an unobjectional one, namely, the partial division of the carotid artery of a goat, the bleeding of which he undertook to stop by means of his fluid. He allowed us to expose the vessel and cut it across ; about one-half of the circumference of the artery was divided, and the bleeding was most profuse.

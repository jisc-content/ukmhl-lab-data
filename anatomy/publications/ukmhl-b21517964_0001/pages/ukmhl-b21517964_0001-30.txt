EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 10 spark in the dark,—nor in the light detect the slightest indications of the passage of electricity, either by the galvanometer, or the test of the sensation or shock. I have been equally unsuc- cessful in using an electroscope, formed on the principle of Coulomb’s, which displayed sparks when touched either by a small rod of glass slightly excited, or of sealing-wax ;—even when the torpedo was taken out of water, and all loosely adhering moisture removed, no effect could be obtained, not even the slightest indications of attraction. I have varied the trials, using highly rarefied air at ordinary temperatures, and also condensed air deprived of moisture, with the same negative result. And I have been equally unsuccessful in substituting flame; unless the metallic points were in contact in the flame of the spirit-lamp, the passage of the electri- city appeared to be completely interrupted. In very many experiments, employing the most active fish, if there were any visible space between the ends of the red-hot platina wire, I never witnessed the galvanometer in connexion with one wire affected, nor could obtain a shock. Reasoning on the sub- ject, this perhaps is what might be expected, consi- dering that the surface of the fish is a better conductor than air. One fact, however, which I had observed, afforded some encouragement to per- sist in the trials,—the fact that the torpedinal electri- city passes through distilled water, which is a worse conductor of it than its own skin.

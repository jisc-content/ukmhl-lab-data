In neither instance was the health deranged ; nor had its bite, sixteen days after, any effect on a small full-grown dog.

During the first hour, the bird walked about and ate, as if nothing ailed him. Then he gradually sickened; his feathers became ruffled; he ate very little, and remained stationary in one place. For a day and half, he continued growing slowly worse ; on the morning of the second day, he was found lying down, breathing very quick, and apparently insensible.

Experiment 5. — A few minutes after the last fowl was bitten, another young cock, of the same age nearly and size as the preceding, was exposed to the snake. The snake fastened on his thigh, and in- llicted rather a severe wound, from which some blood

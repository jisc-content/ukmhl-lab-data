289 ON THE SKIN. coloured. When a part not discoloured is blistered, in healing, it passes from red to brown ; and it is often a long time before the part regains its healthy hue; generally, I believe, the fairer the skin, the less it is made brown by'a blister, and the sooner it recovers its original whiteness; and I believe the hotter the climate and season, so much the more slowly it regains it. 3.— Of the Cause of the Change of Colour, and of the manner in which it operates. My experiments relative to the cause of the change of colour produced in the skin by the sun’s rays, are not so satisfactory as I could wish. They tend, however, rather to prove that the effect is produced solely by the undecompounded rays. I have exposed, for more than two hours, and that re- peatedly, the- delicate skin of the under part of the fore-arm to the solar spectrum ; and I have concen- trated the differently coloured rays of the spectrum, by means of a lens on the skin, but without occa- sioning either erythema or discoloration. Relative to the manner in which the effect is produced, is it immediate and direct; or mediate and indirect ? In other words, is it the simple effect of the sun’s rays impinging on the skin ; or the effect of the inflammation which they occasion; or do the sun’s rays act in both ways ? That they act powerfully indirectly in producing VOL. I. u

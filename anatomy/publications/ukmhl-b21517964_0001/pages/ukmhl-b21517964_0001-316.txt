296 EFFECTS OF THE SUN’s RAYS was not the slightest appearance of desquamation, and it was only just perceptibly darker than the ad- joining skin. From these results, I am disposed to infer, that the colouring matter of the skin of the Negro affords some protection from the scorching effects of the sun’s rays, but not complete protection, and that were his skin as much disposed to inflame from the action of the sun’s rays as the skin of the fairest European, this colouring matter would not prevent occasional vesication. Some of the facts already mentioned tend to support this opinion, especially the circumstance that exemption from the scorch- ing effect of the sun is not confined to the African Negro, but is possessed equally by all the various races of men,—the inhabitants of hot climates, who are much in the open air, and exposed to bright light, whether the colour be almost black, like that of the lower classes of Singalese, or of a dull straw colour, like that of the Bojesman of Southern Africa, or of a ruddy brown, as in the instance of the Albanian shepherd of the mountains of Greece.

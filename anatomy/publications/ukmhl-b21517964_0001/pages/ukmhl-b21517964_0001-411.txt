ANIMAL MATTER IN DIFFERENT BONES. 391 instead of 32’8 after the boiling, thus shewing a removal of 1 per cent, of animal matter by the boiling process. How the remaining specimens, excepting No. 56, were prepared is not known. They were sent from foreign stations, and were probably previously ma- cerated in water or left exposed to the air, like No. 56, till the soft parts had been destroyed by the action of the elements. The crania extending from No. 23 to 55, it will be seen, were from four descriptions of patients:— 1. those who had died of tubercular phthisis; 2. those who had died of other diseases not connected with tubercle ; 3. those who had died of sea scurvy; and 4. insane persons. The majority of them were part of a series preserved during twelve months, taken from every fatal case which occurred, and put aside for the purpose of comparison. The average proportion of calcareous matter afforded in these four different classes, was the fol- lowing per cent:— Phthisis ...... 67’7 Other diseases unconnected with tubercles 67’6 Sea-scurvy ..... 65T Insanity ...... 67*5 With the exception of the instances of sea-scurvy, these differences are so small, that perhaps it may appear questionable, that they are owing to disease: in sea-scurvy, it has been asserted, that the bones have been affected, and that old fractures have

ON THE ACTION OF VINEGAR 378 acid, of the specific gravity already mentioned, will bear, without being deprived of its antiseptic power, I have used it diluted with one, two, four, and eight parts of water. Portions of muscle were immersed in these mixtures of vinegar and water, and air was allowed to have access. Examined after two months, during which the atmospheric temperature varied between 80° and 92°, each portion of muscle was found well preserved and free from putrid smell, excepting that in the most dilute,—which, in a few days, began to putrefy: the experiment was made in Malta. In this country I have made a few other trials. In November, 1836, a portion of stomach, of duodenum, ileum, rectum, and tongue, after hav- ing been steeped for a day or two in distilled vinegar, were transferred to weaker acid, (distilled vinegar diluted with four parts of water). Three years have now passed, and all these parts are in perfect preser- vation. Each was placed in a jar apart, suspended in the fluid in the usual manner, and covered with bladder, &c., to exclude atmospheric air; and, with the exception of one, after the lapse of the time mentioned, no air has got admission. In the ex- ception, the bladder was attacked by insects, and yet, notwithstanding the accident, and partial evapo- ration and free admission of atmospheric air, the preparation (the tongue) is in a good condition and displays well the peculiarities of the organ. Vinegar, I find, has not only the power of pre- venting putrefaction from taking place, but also of

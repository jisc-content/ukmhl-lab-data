250 TWO CASES OF The disease in this its last stage exhibited some peculiarities, the cause of which, referrible to pneuma- thorax, was not discovered until after death, for the case being considered hopeless, and the weather being very cold, the requisite examination of the chest was intentionally omitted.* The body was inspected fourteen hours after death. The right side of the chest exhibited a great degree of fulness; and it emitted, when struck, a hollow sound. On carefully opening the abdomen, the diaphragm was found protruding into the right hypochondrium, exhibiting a convex surface, almost conical, instead of concave ; and it was tense and tympanitic. The right lobe of the liver was pressed into the epigastrium, and rested on a portion of the stomach and duodenum, and on a part of the transverse colon. Owing to the pressure of the liver, the pyloric portion of the stomach was removed from its natural situation to the left iliac region, where it rested on the upper part of the sigmoid flexure of the colon; and owing to the same pres- sure, the small intestines generally were driven down- wards and more or less displaced. The body having been immersed in a bath, a small opening was made with a scalpel under water, into that part of the right pleura best adapted by situation to allow of the escape of air. Air issued out in abundance, and with much force ; 212 cubic * At this time, the Stethoscope was not employed in the General Hospital; I first saw this excellent instrument, the following autumn in Edinburgh, and then commenced its use.

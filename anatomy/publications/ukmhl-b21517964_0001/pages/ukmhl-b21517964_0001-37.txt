ON THE TORPEDO. 17 To ascertain, if they preserve the same relation to each other, when the fish is made to act on the mul- tiplier, and on the needle in the spiral, the following experiments were made. Successively at different times, with the same fish, and also with different torpedos, comparative experiments were tried on the course of the needle in the multiplier, when affected by the electricity of the fish, and by that of a couple of very small plates of copper and zinc immersed in a weak acid. In every instance the wire commu- nicating with the under surface of the torpedo, was found to correspond in its effect with the copper plate, and that with the upper surface with the zinc plate ; and whether one wire was in communication with the under surface of the fish, and the other with the upper, or the former with the copper plate, and the latter with the zinc plate, the deviation of the needle was in the same direction; its south pole turned to the west, and of course, its north to the east; and if the lower contact wire was made the upper, the effect on the deviation of the needle was identical with a change of the plates. I have found the same uniformity of result in the polarity imparted by the torpedo to a needle in the spiral wire; the extremity of it, nearest the under surface in the circle, has always acquired southern polarity, and the other extremity of course northern. Besides the preceding results, I have obtained some others, of a miscellaneous nature, which, in consideration of the obscurity of the subject, and its c

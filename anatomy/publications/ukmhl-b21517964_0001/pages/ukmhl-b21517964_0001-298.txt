TWO CASES OF 278 nature of the passage.* I believe we must look chiefly to the source of the air, and the absorbent power of the pleura for the explanation in question. In this case, as in Iredillâ€™s, there is reason to suppose that the air accumulated in the chest was common air, more or less vitiated by respiration previously, and more or less altered by the process of absorption after entering the cavity of the pleura. Taking this view of the subject, the composition of the air, each time it was examined, is easily ac- counted for, excepting in the last instance, when the proportion of carbonic acid gas was found to be so large, after death. On what this depended it is not easy to say; it is matter for conjecture, and seems to require further investigation. Messrs. Allen and Pepys, after a forced expiration, found air from the lungs to contain as much as 9*5 per cent, carbonic acid gas ;f and in the different in- stances that I have examined the air contained in the lungs a few hours after death, I have found the proportion of carbonic acid gas to vary from 8 to 12 per cent.; thus in a fatal case of empyema, the air * The perforation being slightly oblique, the pleura costalis lined with coagulable lymph, closed the external aperture in the rib on ex- piration, and prevented completely the egress of air, even when the dressings were removed and the external aperture uncovered. When the trochar was introduced, the stilette was withdrawn during expi- ration, and the finger was applied to the mouth of the cannula during each inspiration. t Phil. Trans, for 1808.

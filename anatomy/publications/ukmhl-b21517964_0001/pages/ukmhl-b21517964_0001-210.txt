190 TEMPERATURE OF MAN Another frog, taken from the turf close to the pond, where it had been a short time basking, was 68", in recto ; the thermometer exposed in the same place amongst the grass was 65".* Iguana.—At Colombo, 4th September, air 82", the temperature of this animal was 82’5. Serpents.—At Colombo, on the 27th of August, air 81*5, the temperature of an elegant green snake, a species of Coluber, was 88’5, in eesophago. At the same place, on the 24th of August, air 82*5, the temperature of a small species of brown snake, another species of Coluber, was 84*5 in ahdomine. On the 23d of September, air 83", the temperature of dif- ferent species of brown snakes, also belonging to the genus Coluber was 90°, in oesophago. 4.— 0/ the Temperature of Fishes. Shark.—In latitude N. 8" 23', on the 11th of March, 1816, air 71*75, sea 74*75, the temperature of a large female shark, just taken, and still alive, was 77" in the deep muscles near the tail. Bonito.—In latitude S. 1" 14', on the 29th of July, 1816, air 78", sea 80*5, the temperature of the * These frogs were all males (no females were found in the pond)^ they were full grown, and active; their testes large. In their sto- machs were caterpillars and insects, and in one two small hard stones. My observations seemed to shew that their temperature is varia- ble, as might be expected, according to the activity of their respiration; and that, occasionally, it is at least three degrees higher than the moist body would be similarly circumstanced, independent of respi- ration.

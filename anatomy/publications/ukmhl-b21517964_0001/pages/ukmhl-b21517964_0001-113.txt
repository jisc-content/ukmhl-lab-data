ON THE TORPEDO. 93 spotted kind, (T. oculata^) I have observed another peculiarity,â€”filaments, like thick hairs or slender bristles, externally growing from the integuments ; they are exhibited in Figure 2, Plate XII. attached to the margin of the temporal apertures, and also to the tail. From a slight examination which I made of them, they appeared to be very analo- gous to hair.

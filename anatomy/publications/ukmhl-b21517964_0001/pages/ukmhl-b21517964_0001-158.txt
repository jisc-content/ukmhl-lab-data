138 ON THE STRUCTURE OF not ascertained; most probably it does. And reasoning from analogy, it appeared highly probable, that all the other genera of the order Batrachia, have a similar conformation, both of this vital organ, and of the sanguineous system in general. I then remarked, should this analogical infer- ence prove correct, and its truth be established by observation, these animals in their mature state would no longer be an anomaly in the classification of reptiles on account of their hearts, and they would still continue as a link connecting the rep- tiles with fishes,—the perennibranchiate, through the whole of their existence; the other species during the first stage of it, by the peculiarities of their respiratory organs. This conjecture was offered in 1825, in a paper which was presented to the Royal Society, and which was afterwards published in the Edinburgh Journal of Science, edited by Professor Jameson; and I am happy to have to state, that it has been amply verified by the able and minute researches of Mr. Owen, as well as by those of other inquirers.* I have stated, that when I began my inquiries, and first published my observations, all the batra- chians were considered by the ablest comparative anatomists from the time of Harvey, downwards, as analogous to fishes in the auricular structure of * Mr. Owen’s observations are to be found in his Paper on the Structure of the Heart in the Perennibranchiate Batrachia, com- municated to the Zoological Society, April, 1834.

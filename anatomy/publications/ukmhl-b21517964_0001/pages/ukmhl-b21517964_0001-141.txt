POISONOUS SNAKES OF CEYLON. 121 parts immediately swelled, and discharged an ichor- ous lliiid. From the foot the swelling extended to the shoulder; and from the shoulder to the integu- ments of the chest; subsiding where it first appeared, as it spread beyond. The health of the dog was much deranged ; for two days, it could stand with difficulty, and ate very little. It had frequent small bloody evacuations, as if the bowels were inflamed. At the end of three days there was a considerable improve- ment ; a great part of the skin of the leg bitten was now livid, and on the fourth day sloughed off, expos- ing an extensive healthy ulcerating surface. On the fifth day, the animal was still sickly; the ulcer healed slowly, and the dog gradually recovered its health. Experiment 3.â€”On the day following that on which the two preceding experiments had been made, a half-grown fowl was bit by the snake just above the left eye. The eye immediately closed; a watery fluid, like tears, flowed from it, and there was a similar discharge from the nostrils. When the eye-lid was forced open, the pupil contracted readily on the admission of stronger light. The opposite side of the face soon became considerably swollen. The fowl drooped, but never lost the use of its legs. It refused to eat, and was much purged ; what was voided had a chalky appearance. On the third day, it seemed to recover a little, and ate a small quantity of grain. On the fourth day, it was found dead.

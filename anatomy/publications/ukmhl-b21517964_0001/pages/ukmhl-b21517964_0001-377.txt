357 ACID TO ANATOMICAL PURPOSES. tioD of vegetable juices. I found that serum coagu- lated by this acid gas, and converted into a kind of jelly, may be kept in water several weeks, exposed to the air, without undergoing any change, and that the fibrin of the blood, thus treated, was equally exempt from change. Similar trials were made with many anatomical preparations; they were ex- posed to the air in this acid, and were then taken out of the acid and placed in water exposed to the air; and the result shewed that after having been well acted on by the acid, they were no longer liable to putrefaction. Some of them underwent very little change, during exposure to the air, for several weeks in water; others became soft and gelatinous, and were partially reduced to a pulp, but without emit- ting any offensive odour, like that of putrid animal matter, an odour rather like that of decaying vege- table matter affected with mildew.* How the sulphurous acid acts in preserving animal substances it is difficult to say. I am not aware that it is yet ascertained how it preserves vegetable sub- stances ; how it prevents vinous fermentation in vegetable juices, such as are most prone to undergo it, as the juice of the grape, &c.; how it prevents light wines and vinous fluids to which atmospheric air has access, from becoming sour or converted into vinegar; or how, moreover, it stops the process of ulterior change to which unpurified vinegar, and * These experiments were made at Corfu, and during the hot summer months.

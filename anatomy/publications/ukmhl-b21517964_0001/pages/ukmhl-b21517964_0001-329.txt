IN THE BASILAR ARTERY OF MAN. 309 which tubercles were found in the lungs, viz. 40 per cent, of the whole, may excite surprise. I must confess it had that effect on my mind, and the more so, as no doubtful instances were admitted : I rigor- ously rejected every example not coming under the denomination of the consumptive tubercleâ€”that is, a tubercle, albuminous in composition, admitting of induration by boiling, as pointed out by Dr. Aber- crombie, and of softening in the progress of disease, giving rise to vomicae and excavations in the lungs. The melanotic tubercle was excluded, and also cer- tain concretions more or less resembling tubercles, whether consisting principally of phosphate of lime and the other materials of bone, or of a nature approaching to cartilage. I may also remark, that no cases were admitted as supposed instances of tubercles, from the presence merely of cavities in the lungs. Cavities existing unaccompanied by tu- bercles were inferred to be examples of pulmonary abscess, of which several instances occurred. No doubt, the astounding frequency of tubercles recorded in the Table, is partly owing to the de- scription of cases sent to the General Hospital, at Fort Pitt, where a considerable proportion of the whole mortality under observation occurred. But, making the most ample allowance, on this account, I apprehend the conclusion is unavoidable, that the existence of tubercle is far more frequent than is commonly supposed, and the reported deaths from nhthisis would indicate.

FLUID IN THE VESICULvE SEMINALES OF MAN. 313 Conceiving that some light might be thrown on the subject by the examination of the fluid in the vesicLilae and in the vasa deferentia, after death, in a variety of cases, I have availed myself, for the purpose, of such opportunities as have offered in the General Military Hospital, at Fort Pitt, under my superintendence. And I shall now relate the re- sults,—with the belief, that they may aid in settling the disputed question;—and, also with the hope, that they may be found to be not entirely devoid of interest in connexion with an obscure branch of pathological inquiry. It is necessary for this double purpose to prefix in each instance a slight notice of the fatal case. I shall make no selection of cases; but give them nearly in the order as to time in which they occurred. And, I may remark, that, as every fatal case was sub- jected to a post-mortem examination, according to the usage of the hospital, these brought forward (the total deaths from the 22d September, 1838, to the 6th of the ensuing December) afford a tolerably correct example of the general mortality of this hospital,—the patients in which are chiefly invalids labouring under chronic diseases, incapacitating them for farther military service. 1.—Aged 30 ; previously labouring under pul- monary disease and an impaired constitution, was • later anatomists have supposed that the vesiculse seminales produced' a secretion of a peculiar nature, the use of which may probably be to dilute the semen, or to add to its bulk.”

32 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS tendonous fibres have been converted into jelly, and the columns have fallen asunder, having the appearance and consistence of a translucent very soft mucilage. To what this difference of effect may be owing, I am at a loss to conceive; perhaps the Roman fish were older than the Maltese; or the aqueduct water at Rome may be harder than the rain cistern-water of Malta. On exposure to the air in a damp atmosphere, or by maceration in water, changing the water daily, the electrical organs undergo change more slowly than the parts distinctly muscular; in putrefaction and maceration they resemble less muscular fibre than ten- dinous fibre, which latter offers great resistance to both these processes. But I would not lay any stress on this quality of resistance, as it is extremely vague, depending on circumstances which it is difficult to appreciate, as every one must be convinced, who has compared the different degrees of rapidity with which different orders of muscles of man, and the larger mammalia, undergo change from putrefaction and maceration; for instance, the slowness with which the muscular fibres of the stomach and intestines alter, and the rapidity of change of the fibres of the heart and thick muscles. Quitting the organs of the dead fish, I shall now notice the few observations which I have made on them before they have been deprived of their vi- tality.

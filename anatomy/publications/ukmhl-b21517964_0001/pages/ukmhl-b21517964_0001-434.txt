414 XXIII. SOME DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING AND KEEPING ANA- TOMICAL PREPARATIONS IN HOT CLIMATES. It is too generally supposed that the making and keeping of anatomical preparations in hot climates is almost impossible, or attended with so much dif- ficulty as to be practically impossible, with the ordi- nary means within the reach of medical men. This is a mistaken notion, and it is for the inte- rest of science that it should be refuted.* The * My attention was directed to the above subject in 1825, when the present director-general of the army medical department, was calling on medical officers on foreign stations to contribute to the museum at Fort Pitt, then in its infancy, and which now, owing in great measure to the assistance so afforded, is become one of the most valuable collections of pathological anatomy in this or in any other country. Most of the observations contained in this paper were written at that time, and privately circulated with the view to remove the impression alluded to in the text; and were afterwards published in the 8th vol. of the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal. I am induced again to brjng them forward, with such alterations as extended experience has suggested, with the hope that they may be still useful in the important cause of pathological research, and of that museum which is the permanent record of such research amongst the medical officers of the army, by whom it has been formed.

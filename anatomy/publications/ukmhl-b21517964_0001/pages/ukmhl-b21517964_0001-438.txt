418 DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING AND KEEPING should be treated in the same manner, and so treated they are easily kept. Thus also should be managed preparations of the eye, pleurae, peritoneum, testes, and their tunics, and in fact all such parts as are either colourless, and there- fore not requiring steeping in water, or are liable to be injured by that process, and by incipient putre- faction. On the contrary, parts containing much blood, as the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart; or stained and dis- coloured with blood or bile, &c., as the blood-vessels and gall-bladder, &c.; or, smeared with a lubricating fluid, as the aspera arteria, primae vise, synovial membranes, &c., should be immediately well washed, and if practicable, in a stream of water. By perse- vering washing in running water, and gently pressing the part, treating it like a sponge, in a short time, as from ten to twenty minutes, most textures may be deprived of the blood which they contain, and of any secreted fluids peculiar to them. If leisure does not admit of such manipulation, and assistance is not available for the purpose, the parts may be sus- pended in water, and the hotter the weather is, the shorter should be the time of suspension, and the more frequently the w^ater should be changed. In thus steeping, it is of importance to use a tall large vessel, full of water,â€”and to have the parts im- mersed only just below the surface. The rationale of this must be manifest to those who reflect on the subject, and take into consideration, 1st, that blood

ANATOMICAL PREPARATIONS IN HOT CLIMATES. 423 tive list, that should accompany the preparations to England. Relative to the making of dry preparations in hot climates, it will be sufficient to offer a very few ob- servations. The unexperienced in these climates may fancy the task in question exceedingly easy, from a common and erroneous association of the ideas of proximity to the sun and parching heat. They will find it, however, a more difficult labour than can be imagined d priori; and for this reason, that the connexion of heat, and dryness just now alluded to, is in most hot climates of rarer occur- rence than the association of high temperature with a great degree of humidity. This latter happens when the wind sweeps on its way over a great ex- tent of sea, and on its passage becomes loaded with moisture, as is the case with the S.W. monsoon along the coast of India, the S.E. or sirocco in the Mediterranean, and the sea breeze in the West India islands. During the prevalence of these winds, it is very difficult to dry any anatomical preparation, and impossible indeed, unless recourse is had to some helping circumstance, as exposure to the direct rays of the sun, or the dry heat of a charcoal fire. On the contrary, when the atmospheric heat is ac- companied with dryness, as it always is, when the wind comes over an extensive tract of country, such as the land wind in India, the N.W. in the Ionian Islands, the S.E. on the Western shore of Southern

ON THE TORPEDO. 39 but interrupted, as it were dotted, as if the sheath contained a succession of portions with a little space between each.* In the anatomical structure of the torpedo, the mucous system forms a very conspicuous part; it consists of several clusters and chains of glands dis- tributed chiefly round the electrical organs, at dif- ferent depths beneath the cutis, and of strong trans- parent vessels of various lengths and sizes opening externally on the skin, for the purpose of pouring out the thick mucus secreted by the glands, and destined for lubricating the surface. This system has not been noticed by Mr. Hunter, and it has been but imperfectly described by Lorenzini.f Though it is not peculiar to the torpedo, it is much more strongly developed in this fish than in any other species of Ray with which I am acquainted ; and the situation of the glands, and the distribution of their vessels are different. Whether it is concerned in any way with the electrical function of the torpedo, is deserving of consideration. That it is thus con- * An after examination, using Ross’s microscope, and his object- glass of one-eighth of an inch focal distance, has not confirmed the above. Comparing a fibril of an electrical nerve and of a spinal nerve, taken from a fish which had been preserved in spirits four years, there appeared to be no material difference in their minute structure: each appeared irregularly fibrous,—that is, composed of fibres not perfectly continuous or exactly parallel, connected by a delicate net-like tissue. t Osservazioni intomo alle Torpedini fatte de Steffano Lorenzini Fiorentino. 4to.

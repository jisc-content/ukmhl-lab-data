448 EXPERIMENTS ON THE RUPTURE OF THE quantity, and to employ great force, before a rupture was effected. The ruptured part was detected with some difficulty; it proved to be the left emulgent artery, about a quarter of an inch from its origin. Its middle coat was lacerated in two places, in the direction of the fibres composing it, and also the inner coat. There was no perceptible opening in the outer cellular. The course of the aorta, even through the chest, was distended with water, and indeed the whole of the posterior mediastinum was so distended, and pretty much had found its way into the pleurae. The left ventricle and auricle were empty, excepting that the latter contained a little blood, shewing that the semilunar valves had per- formed their function to perfection. Experiment 14. Thirteen hours after death from tubercles and cavities in the lungs, complicated with diseased omentum, enlargement of the liver and severe ulce- ration of the large intestines, in the instance of a soldier aged 33 ; after examining the brain and tying the jugular veins, the pipe of the syringe was introduced into the right internal jugular vein, below its ligature, and water was injected; consi- derable resistance was almost immediately experi- enced, giving the idea, that the right cavities of the heart were obstructed with coagulated blood. After the syringe had been emptied two or three times.

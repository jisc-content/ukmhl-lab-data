Ill BY THE COMMON TOAD. to the function of the lungs. In support of this idea, I may remark, that I have found the pulmonary arteries of the toad, each divided into two branches; one of which went to its respective lung, and the other, very little smaller, to the cutis, between the head and shoulder on each side, and was extensively ramified where the largest follicles were situated, and where there was a plexus of veins of great size, as if intended for a reservoir of blood. This last-mentioned peculiarity of structure, and the situation of it, corresponding to the gills of the tad-pole, would seem to indicate that the subcu- taneous distribution of the second branch of the pul- monary artery, may aid the lungs further in their office by bringing the blood to the surface to be acted on by atmospheric air. I have endeavoured to ascertain if there is any direct communication by spiracula through the inte- guments. The results obtained have been negative. Air has been introduced by means of a forcing syringe, under the loose skin, through a small incision, also into the cavity of the abdomen, and into the lungs by the superior glottis ; and it has been much compressed, in these parts under water, yet it has been completely confinedâ€”not even the smallest by an acid, were properties sufficiently characteristic of their nature. Whether the presence of silica in these instances is to be consi- dered as accidental, or the effect of disease, or constant and normal, analogous to what occurs in the protecting epidermis of some plants, remains to be ascertained.

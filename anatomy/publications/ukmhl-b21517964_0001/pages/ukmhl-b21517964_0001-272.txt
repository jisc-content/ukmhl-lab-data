TWO CASES OF , 252 lar structure was discovered, allowing of air being pumped into the pleura in the act of inspiration ; but not of its escape in expiration, to which no doubt was owing the great accumulation of air. Even at the risk of being tedious, I shall attempt to convey some idea of this structure. Between the false membrane of the vomica and the pleura, there was a small irregular sinus, not exceeding an inch in diameter, the sides of which, though not adhering, of course were in contact, or very nearly so. This sinus was the channel of communication, and con- tained the valvular structure alluded to. It opened into the cavity of the chest by a hole in the pleura pulmonalis, about the size of a crow-quill, and into the vomica by three smaller holes in the substance of the lung, not corresponding with the former, so that a probe could not be passed from one into the other in a straight line ; and, consequently, when the surfaces of the sinus were pressed together by the compression of the air in the pleura, in the act of expiration, the passage through which the air entered was closed, and its exit prevented. A very brief notice of the other morbid appear- ances will suffice. Besides the vomica described, in the right lung, this viscus contained small tuber- cles, few in number in the inferior lobe, but abundant in the superior. The largest of them did not ex- ceed in size a common pea, and the smallest were not larger than a mustard seed. The smallest were

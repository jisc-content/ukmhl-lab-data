He said that in three hours the bandage and compresses might be removed without any re- newal of the hemorrhage.* Accordingly, at the end of three hours, they were removed, but, when the last compress was raised, the bleeding broke out as furiously as at first, and, to save the life of the animal, the artery was secured by ligature. On examining the last compress, a small coagulum of blood was found adhering to it, just the size proper to close the wound in the carotid,—thus accountingfor the ceasing and renewal of the bleeding. Reflecting on this result, and considering the chemical nature of the fluid employed to moisten the compresses, which appeared analagous to that of Binelli, the conclusion I arrived at was obvious, namely, that had the compresses used been moistened simply with common water, the effect would have been the same,—the bleeding would have been * The following marvellous result is related in the pamphlet al- ready alluded to,—witnessed, it is asserted, by a commission com- posed of some of the most respectable medical men in Naples,— whose names are given, many of them professors in the university of that city. “ II Professore D.

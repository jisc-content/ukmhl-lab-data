444 EXPERIMENTS ON THE RUPTURE OF THE close to the entrance of one of the pulmonary veins.* Experiment 8. About four hours after death from chronic dysen- tery, complicated with a few tubercles in the lungs, and two small cavities, in the instance of a soldier aged 28 years, after tying the aorta below its arch * In the above, and in many other instances noticed in this work, the post-mortem examination was made sooner than is usual. In all such cases means were taken to determine previously the reality of the fatal event—as by making a small incision through the cutis, and puncturing the fibres of the platisma myoides (a muscle, which is probably very retentive of vital contractile power, judging from the analogy of the panniculus carnosus) and by exposing the eye to light. To the pathologist, conversant with necroscopical research, such precautions may appear superfluous; he may say. Who ever knew an example in hospital experience, of a body supposed to be dead, and removed as such from the ward to the dead-house, either reviving, or affording any indications of remaining vitality ? I never witnessed an example of the kind, nor ever heard of one weU authen- ticated, excepting in bodies which had died of that mysterious dis- ease, cholera, in which in a few rare instances, it is well established, that particular muscles have acted, after the extinction of life. Not- withstanding, although all experience supports the foregoing con- clusion, yet as apparent death—suspended animation is within the limits of possibility, and keeping in recollection what happened to the illustrious Vesalius, it is at least in accordanee with proper feeling, and a satisfaction to employ the tests alluded to ; and the popular ad- vocates of measures to prevent what is held up to horror—too early burying, on the supposition combated, that suspended animation and apparent death is not uncommon, would act more consistently with their views, if, instead of proposing that bells should be hung up within reach of the interred, or attached to their persons, they re- commended the puncturing of some irritable part, before the body is committed to the coffin.

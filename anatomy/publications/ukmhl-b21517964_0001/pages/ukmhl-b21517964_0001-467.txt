447 HEART AND GREAT VESSELS. open, and also of the chest partially by the removal of the sternum and of the costal cartilages. After a certain quantity of water was injected, it flowed out through the trachea, probably through ruptured vessels in the tubercular excavations. The lungs, the liver and spleen were rendered tense, and there was an exudation of fluid during the continuance of the pressure, not only from the surface of the lungs, but apparently, generally, in the cavity of the abdomen from all its contained viscera. Experiment 12. The result was similar, when water was injected, into the aorta, just above its division into the com- mon iliac arteries. As the artery became dilated, the semilunar valves performed their function less perfectly, and the flow of water through the trachea increased. Experiment 13. Twenty-five hours after death from peritoneal inflammation, in the instance of an insane soldier, aged 44 ; after examining the brain, and securing the vertebral arteries within the cranium, and the carotid arteries in the neck, previous to opening the chest; introduced the pipe of the syringe into the aorta just before its division into the common iliac arteries, and having secured it by ligature, (all the abdominal viscera remaining undisturbed,) injected water as before. It was necessary to inject a very large

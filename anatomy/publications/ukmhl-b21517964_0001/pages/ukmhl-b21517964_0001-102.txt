82 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS parts are not in the least altered by the action of an acid which removes the earthy ingredients, they are, with the exception of the vertebrae, entirely destroyed by calcination, and I believe the putrefactive pro- cess has a similar effect.* The only part of the skeleton which I have ana- lysed in its moist state, was a portion of the princi- pal bone of the pectoral fin, belonging to a fish (T. ocnlata) about eight inches long. It was found to consist of 19*3 cartilage. 67’0 water. 10*7 phosphate of lime. 3*0 carbonate of lime and saline matter, principally common salt. 100-0 Or, without water, of 58’2 cartilage. 41-8 earthy matter, &c. On the dried skeleton, I have made a few more experiments. For the purpose of comparison, the * This may help to account for the vertebrae of cartilaginous fishes, as well as their teeth, being of common occurrence in the fossil state; these retaining their form, when their animal portion s decomposed; the other parts of the skeleton losing their form, being reduced to dust by the change. On the same principle, the bony plates constituting the outer integument of the squali, and the spines and bony tubercles connected with the skin of many of the rays, may be expected to he found in the fossil state, as from the experiments which I have made on them, it appears that their form is not destroyed by the action of fire.

FLUID IN THE 31() in its inferior part was severely ulcerated, and the cseciim slightly. There had been diarrhoea in the last stage of the disease. The vasa deferentia, and the vesiculae seminales, were removed and examined six hours after death. The contents of the latter were small in quantity, and of nearly gelatinous consistence. The fluid of the ducts was more liquid, and nearly of its usual cream or purulent-like appearance. In neither of them could any animalcules be discovered, or even vestiges of them, or any distinct globules. 4. —Aged 20; died of pulmonary consumption.

No notable lesion was detected independent of the pulmonary disease, which was vast and various,—a complication of tubercles and cavities, of oedema and hepatization. The intes- tines were not ulcerated. The vesiculse and vasa deferentia were examined eleven hours after death. The former contained a small quantity of fluid, which was brownish, thick, and slightly viscid,—the latter an extremely minute portion, like thin starch.

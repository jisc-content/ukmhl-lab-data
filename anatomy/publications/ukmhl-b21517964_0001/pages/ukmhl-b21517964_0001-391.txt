ACID TO ANATOMICAL PURPOSES. 371 acid, displays not only the ordinary phenomena of a tubercLila rexcavation, but, what is considered a very rare occurrence, blood-vessels (veins) terminating in the cavity with open mouths.* I apprehend it will prove very useful in studying the nature of tubercles, and in determining some doubtful points respecting them. There are two preparations now before me, which I may mention in illustration ; one, a portion of lung containing tubercles in their early granular stage ; another, con- taining a tubercular mass: the former are clearly in the cellular structure of the organ; in the latter blood-vessels and bronchial tubes may be detected, clearly indicating that the tubercular matter has been deposited on them so as to include them,f according to the analogy of the deposition of lymph in hepatized lung. The morbid changes of the arteries are very easily examined and exposed by immersion in this acid, and chiefly in consequence of its rendering the dif- ferent coats so very distinct and distinguishable. In all the specimens of aneurism which I have examined, * This occurrence, I believe, is much less rare than is commonly supposed. It may frequently be detected in tubercular excavations, by passing fine probes into the vessels which terminate in the cavity abruptly, marked by a short projecting portion, their course having been interrupted by the ulcerative process which formed the vomica. I have often found the canal of the vessel unclosed, its aperture, in a manner, hid by the projecting portion, which, in some instances, has been so situated as to act the part of a valve. t The appearance mentioned above, not carefully examined, might give rise to the idea, that tubercles are vascular.

410 OBSERVATIONS ON THE CONTENTS OF No. 1 Age. Principal organic lesions discovered by autopsia. Hours after death. 1 Observations on the urine. 25 39 i 1 Tubercles and cavities in lungs. Large intestines several ulcerated : end of appendicula vermiformis perforated by ulcera- tion, adhering to colon, and gangrenous where adhering 13 1^ oz.: light ale-coloured : slightly turbid: acid : sp. gr. 1014: slightly serous: contained many spermato- zoa, and very minute par- ticles : not deficient in urea 25 38 Ulceration of pharynx and larynx, with oedema of margin of epiglottis and glottis, and partially of the lungs, with destruc- tion of a considerable portion of the palate, in- cluding the greater part of the bony plates 34 4 oz.: pale ale-coloured : a mucous sediment on stand- ing: sp.gr. 1027: acid: slightly serous: contained some urea 27 33 Tubercles and cavities in lungs .... 29 1 oz.: ale-coloured : sp. gr. 1020: acid: slightly se- rous : contained urea 28 35 Fracture of cranium, with laceration of middle me- ningeal artery and extra- vasation of a large quan- tity of blood within the cranium 27 1 drachm: a sediment of gelatinous mucus, con- sisting (as seen under the microscope) of particles, globular and filamentous, like those noticed in case 23.

TWO CASES OF 276 communicate obliquely with a ruptured opening in the side of a large bronchial tube, situated immediately under the pleura. No cavity could be detected there. The adjoining pulmonary substance appeared to be condensed from compression : the substance of the lung generally was in the same state; it con- tained a few minute tubercles; and no other traces of disease. In the fatal case of Iredill, before described, pneumathorax took place in consequence of ulcera- tion effecting a communication between the cavity of the pleura and a vomica in the lung. In this in- stance, the disease originated without the intervention of a vomica,—but, whether without ulceration, con- nected with the softening of a minute tubercle, is doubtful. When I first considered the case, I was disposed to attribute the communication to the rup- ture of a superficial bronchial tube, and to express surprise that accidents of this kind are not more common, taking into account the large number of bronchial tubes which lie immediately under the pleural covering of the lung,—the delicacy of the membrane, and the facility with which it and the bronchia are ruptured. The accuracy of this view appears to me now very questionable, inasmuch, as the delicate pleura has, in its healthy state, always the support of the parietes of the chest, and being constantly in contact with the costal pleura, the risk of its rupture may be supposed to be exceed- ingly small.

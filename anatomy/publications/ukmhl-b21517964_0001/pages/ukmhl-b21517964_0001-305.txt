Were the epider- mis the seat of it, it ought to be immediately dis- coloured by the sun’s rays, which it is not; and when the epidermis separates, the skin should be fair; but the reverse of this is the case,—not till it separates does the skin lose its bright rose-red hue; and not till after several successive desquamations * It is worthy of remark that the effect of the sun’s action on the human hair is quite different from its effect on the skin,—bleaching the one, as much as it darkens the other; tending to bring both to a state as regards hue, best adapted, probably, for defence, such as occur in the Arabian horse, the finest breed of which have a white coat on a black ground, they are in fact Negro-horses with white hair. Every observant traveller must have witnessed instances in illustration, of wdiat has just been observed. The most striking example of the kind which I recollect, is afforded by the female in- habitants of the border town of Itri, on the confines of the Neapo- litan and Roman States, where the women are in the habit of ex- posing themselves, their heads uncovered in the open air; and in consequence there is a striking contrast between the dark sun-burnt countenances, and their comparatively light hair, which, variously discolored by the action of the sun’s rays, and generally much ne- glected, imparts to them an appearance of extreme wildness.

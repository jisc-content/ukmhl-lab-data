OF THE GENUS THYNNUS. 223 chiefly the following :—a large and powerful heart; abundance of blood; red particles in abundance; large gills, and a very large apparatus of branchial nerves. These, all, may be considered as con- cerned either directly or indirectly in the generation of heat. And, the circumstances for the preserva- tion of heat are scarcely less remarkable,—as the manner in which the gills are defended by peculiarly strong opercLila, abounding in fatty matter,—and the deep situation of the principal blood vessels, surrounded by thick muscles,—and in addition, the aorta, or great systemic arterial trunk, surrounded by the principal abdominal viscera, the kidneys, stomach, and liver. Moreover, the habits of these fish, may in some measure contribute to their high temperature. They are frequently to be seen near the surface, and seem to have a delight in springing into the atmosphere. Aristotle, speaking of the tunny, says, “ of all fish, it most enjoys warmth, and on that account swims near the surface and frequents sandy shores —I quote from the old Latin translation of Theodore Goza. “ Thunni omnium maxime piscium gaudent tepore et ob earn rem arenam et littora adeunt; per summa etiam maris innatant quo teporis potian- tur —confounding (as I believe in this instance he has done) fondness for warmth, with the habits connected with its production.

PNEUMATHOUAX. •253 translucent; the larger were of different degrees of opacity; all of them were solid; none had sup- purated. The left lung was free from adhesion. Like the right it contained numerous small tubercles, which had made very little progress. The bronchia were redder than natural, as was also the lower part of the trachea. Three ounces of serum were con- tained in the pericardium, and a larger quantity of fluid than usual in the ventricles of the brain. No air could be detected in the blood vessels, or in the cellular membrane of any part of the body. To return to the contents of the right pleura; the water taken from this cavity (that which entered when the air was discharged) was turbid, as if from the admixture of pus. After resting twenty-four hours in tall glass jars, a wdiite sediment formed, which, carefully separated by decantation, was about an ounce in quantity. It had the appearance of pus, and exhibited the properties of pus when examined by the most approved tests:—thus, it became viscid with a solution of muriate of ammonia; it was soluble in sulphuric acid, and precipitable by dilu- tion with water; and it produced coloured rings when placed between two surfaces of glass, and held before a candle, according to the method re- commended by Dr. Young. The decanted fluid, examined by a solution of corrosive sublimate, and by evaporation, was found to contain serum; and judging from the extract it afforded, it was about

181 AND OTHER ANIMALS. Of the Temperature of the Mammalia. I may premise that in my experiments on the mammalia, with a few exceptions which will be parti- cularly noticed, the temperature of each animal was ascertained by introducing a thermometer into the rectum; and I may extend the remark to the ex- periments on birds; and I may further premise, that, when the contrary is not noticed, the subject of the experiments appeared to be healthy. Monkey {Simia Aygula). — At Colombo, on the 30th of May, air 86°, the temperature of this animal full grown in the axilla was 104i°: rectum, only 1031°. At Amanapoora, in the Kandian country, on the 1st of June, air 73°, the temperature of another full grown monkey of the same kind, in the axilla, was 101°. Pangolin {Manis pentadactyla).—At Colombo on the 4th of November, air 80°, the temperature of a young pangolin apparently sickly, was only 90°. Bat.—In the neighbourhood of Colombo, on the 27th of September, air 82°, the temperature of one bat was 100°, and that of another 101°. The in- stant the animals were killed, the thermometer was introduced into the cavity of the abdomen. The species resemble the Vespertilio peruviana of Lin- naeus, but was much smaller. V. vampirus.—At Colombo, on the 15th of October, air 70°, the temperature of this animal.

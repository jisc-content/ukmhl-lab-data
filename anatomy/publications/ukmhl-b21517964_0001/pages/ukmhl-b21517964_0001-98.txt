78 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS moi'ata of Risso, and the T. galvanii, which Ru- dolphi, and I believe latterly Cuvier, has consi- dered identical in species. This appears to me to be proved by their general character being the same, their water-valves, fins, and interior structure; and further, by the circumstance that between the two varieties (the former marked with black spots or patches irregularly distributed, the latter without spots) there is a complete gradation or intermixture, both the spotting and the colouring varying in- finitely, so that it is difficult to find two fish exactly similar in either respect. How much this variation is owing to locality and other circumstances, it is difficult to decide. As the spotted fish is most frequently caught where the bottom is sandy, and the other variety where it is muddy, light may be concerned in the difference, and the spots may be produced like freckles, by the action of light; and in process of time, they may become hereditary, the foetuses generally, even of those varieties, re- sembling in appearance the parent fish. Rudolphi has given to the occhiatella species the Italian name of T. ocellata; perhaps the Latin word oculata* may be preferable. The other spe- cies he designates as T. marmorata, for which might * Pliny, by Bloch and others, is supposed to have applied this term to the torpedo. As in the only passage in which I am aware he has used it, (Hist. Nat. xxxii. c. ii.â€”the passage is little more than a list of fish) the word Torpedo is also employed, as if applied to a different fish, the justness of their supposition is doubtful.

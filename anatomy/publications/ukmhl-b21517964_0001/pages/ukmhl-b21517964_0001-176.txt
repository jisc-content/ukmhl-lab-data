150 EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMAL HEAT. animals, in whom all the vital actions are most ener- getic, higher than that of animals arrived at maturity. I may mention here, in illustration of this statement, a few observations made on infants, as I am not acquainted with any yet published. In one instance I found the heat under the axilla of a child just born 98*5 ; after twelve hours 99"; and after three days, the same, during the whole of which time it appeared in perfect health. On five other children of the same age, similar observations were made. In two instances of weak infants, the temperature, one hour after birth, was found not to exceed 96®, which is two degrees below the standard heat of man in a state of health; but their respiration was still languid, and the next day the heat of the axilla had risen in one to 98*5, and in the other to 99"- To conclude; as in each hypothesis examined, difficulties are found to exist from facts or the results of experiments of an unbending nature, we must at present either suspend theory altogether and search for experimenta crucis, or adopt that hypothesis which is conformable to the greater number of facts. The first measure is certainly most philosophical; but to the latter we are naturally most inclined; and if I were questioned which view is preferable, I should not hesitate in selecting Dr. Black’s, which to me appears both most simple and most satisfactory.

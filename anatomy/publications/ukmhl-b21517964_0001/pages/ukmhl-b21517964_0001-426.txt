406 OBSERVATIONS ON THE CONTENTS OF days before his death, the urine was of sp. grav. 1017, and a few hours before of 1022, and was found to abound in urea, and to contain very little saccharine matter. On inspection of the body, cavities and tubercles were detected in both lungs; and no other material organic lesion was discoverable. The urinary bladder contained about 1^ pint of urine, of sp. grav. 1014, clear and of a bright brown hue. It was found on chemical examination to con- tain a large proportion of urea, without any appre- ciable quantity of saccharine matter. Exclusive of this case, I have notes of twenty- seven others collected at Fort Pitt, in which, the inquiry, post-mortem, relative to the urine was prose- cuted. I shall give the results in a tabular form ; stating the quantity of fluid found in the bladder; its appearance under the microscope when any wise peculiar ; its specific gravity, ascertained by a deli- cate balance ; its acidity (when possessed of that quality) by litmus paper; whether serous or albe- minous, in a marked degree, or not, by the test of nitric acid; and the presence in it of urea, by the effect of the same acid on it, when concentrated by evaporation over boiling water, to the consistence of syrup. No selection of cases was made for the ex- amination ; almost every fatal case that occurred during a period of nearly six months was taken ad- vantage of for the purpose ; and I shall introduce the results obtained from each, in the order of time,

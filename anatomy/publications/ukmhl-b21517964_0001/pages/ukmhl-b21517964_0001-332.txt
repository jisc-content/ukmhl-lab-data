:U2 XVII. OBSERVATIONS ON THE FLUID IN THE VESICULiE SEMINALES OF MAN. I BELIEVE I am justified in stating, that there is still a difference of opinion amongst physiologists re- specting the nature of the fluid of the vesiculse semi- nales, especially in this country, where the authority of John Hunter is necessarily high and influential. The difference of opinion alluded to is, whether the fluid in question is secreted by the testes, or by the vesiculse; and whether, in consequence, the vesiculae are to be viewed chiefly as reservoirs or merely as glands.* * Vide Dr. Bostock’s Elements of Physiology, Vol. iii. p. 7, and foot-note, where the question is left unsettled by the learned author. He thus expresses himself on the subject:—■“ Besides the testes, the vesiculse seminales, both from their size and their situation, have been supposed to perform some important part in the function of generation, although it has been difficult to ascertain the exact nature of the purpose which they serve. The opinion formerly entertained was, that they are merely reservoirs, in which the semen is deposited as it is secreted. In consequence, however, of the observations of Hunter, who remarked that the fluid contained in these cavities appeared to be different from that found in the testes, many of the

104 URINARY ORGANS AND SECRETION eight days, it became slightly turbid and emitted a distinct, though not strong, ammoniacal odour. The conclusions to be drawn from the results of these experiments hardly require to be pointed out, viz. that the urine of the bull-frog and of the brown toad contained urea as a constituent part, and the latter rather abundantly. And reasoning from analogy, it appears highly probable, that the urine of frogs and toads in general, is of a similar nature, and altogether different from that of the other amphibia. It is seldom that any very abrupt transitions are to be observed in nature: the urinary organs of the turtle and tortoise, on the one hand, seem to be a con- necting link between those of the reptiles and the mammalia, especially as regards their form of blad- der and the termination of their ureters ; and on the other, amongst the reptiles themselves, to form a gradation between the snakes and the batrachians.* Perhaps, additional facts are not required to prove, that the nature of the secretion of the kidneys of animals depends more on the intimate and invisible structure of these organs, than on the kind of food the animals consume. Were such facts wanting, there would be no difficulty in furnishing them. How different is the urine of the brown toad and that of any species of small lizard! Yet flies are the * The'gradation is even more complete through the Menobranchus lateralis of the Canadian lakes; its bladder is very small: its ureters terminate in the cloaca, close to the entrance of the bladder.

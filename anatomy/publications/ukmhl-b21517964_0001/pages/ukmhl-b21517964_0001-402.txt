382 ON THE ACTION OF VINEGAR texture. To witness the latter, the parts should be saturated with water, by immersion for a few hours, and suspended in water in a cylindrical jar, to have the aid of magnifying power : in this way the villi of the ileum, even when tanned, may be made ap- parent. Although vinegar has been so long known, and so long in use, and so very much and so variously employed, yet, I believe, that for culinary purposes, it deserves to be more known and more employed, and, especially, amongst the poorer classes, with a view to economy in the preservation of food. Amongst all classes, the waste of animal and vege- table food, from not keeping, is great,—diminishing the quantity and enhancing the price. Now, by means of vinegar, it is practicable to prevent this waste,— and it is most easily effected. In the hottest weather, during the summer in the Mediterranean, when cold meat became tainted and unfit for use in twenty-four hours, or even in a shorter time during the prevalency of the damp sirocco wind, I have had slices of roast and boiled meat, of fish, poultry, &c., put into vinegar, with a proportion of gravy or any plain sauce, and they were preserved perfectly good and fit for the table for weeks. It is well known how long vegetables may be thus kept. Fruit may be preserved in the same way; and many kinds probably, would be palatable and wholesome so pre- served. In Asia Minor, and in the Ionian islands, the natives, as I have witnessed, arc in the habit of

67 ON THE TORPEDO. haps the branchial and the adjoining mucous glands. I shall notice a few circumstances which appear to me favourable to this conjecture. 1. The branchial filaments are most numerous, and of greatest length, whilst the electrical organs are forming; appearing just before these organs begin to be developed, and being removed when they are tolerably complete. Now it seems more reasonable to suppose that this associated progress of the two, is in the relation of cause and effect, than to imagine that the filaments are solely designed as a substitute for the branchise ; especially as the blood in the vessels of the yolk membrane seems to be as well adapted to receive the inffuence of any little air which may be contained in the fluid in the uterine cavity, as the blood circulating in the vessels of the filaments. 2. In none of the squali, the foetus of which I have had an opportunity of examining at different periods, have I found the same elaborate apparatus of branchial filaments : they have been less numerous, and very much shorter. Does not this greater elaboration indicate that they are intended in the torpedo for a special purpose ? and when we consider the nature of the electrical organs, abounding in fluid, as well as their peculiar office, does it not seem accordant that there should be such a peculiar pro- vision as that in question for their formation ? 3. In one instance I found a large fasciculus, as represented in fig. 2, Plate VII, unconnected with the F 2

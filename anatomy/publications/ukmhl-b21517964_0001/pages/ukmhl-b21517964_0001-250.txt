TEMPERATURE OF THE 230 the deeply seated parts felt very hot, imparting a disagreeable sensation, almost like that of burning, to the hand, in contact with them. The thorax was first opened, and afterwards the abdomen. After partial exposure of the surface of the contents of these cavities to the air for about ten minutes, a ther- mometer was procured. Placed under the left ven- tricle of the heart, it rose to 113°; and, under the liver, in contact with the lobulus Spigelii, to 112°. 2. Aged 27 years; a stout robust man, died sud- denly in barracks, on the 6th of August, at about half-past eleven a.m. The body was examined at five p.M.

There was very little blood in the cavities of the heart. The temperature of the air of the room was 86°. As soon as the cavities of the thorax and abdomen were opened, the bulb of a thermometer was in succession placed under the left ventricle of the heart, and under the lobulus Spigelii of the liver ; in the former situation it rose to 108°; in the latter to 107°. About a quarter of an hour afterwards, introduced into the substance of the right lung, gorged with extravasated blood, it was 105°. 3. Aged 25 years; a large, stout, muscular man, was admitted into hospital on the 19th of August, with symptoms of continued fever. On the night of the 22nd, he became delirious; but only for

452 EXPERIMENTS ON THE RUPTURE OF THE the calvaria, a strongly marked contrast was ob- servable between the state of the exterior parts and of the interior, as, perhaps, might, d priori^ have been expected, considering how the latter were encased in unyielding bony parieties. There was only a very little fluid effused in the cellular tissue of the pia mater; merely a moisture between the arachnoid membrane and the dura mater, and only a moderate quantity in the lateral ventricles and at the base of the brain: and the fluid so effused was pro- bably not water which had been injected, but which had previously existed there; this is inferred from the circumstance, that there was a larger proportion in the left lateral ventricle than in the right, notwith- standing, that the pia mater of the former side throughout was red,—its vessels containing blood as usual, whilst that of the right was perfectly colour- less,—all the blood having been washed out of its vessels. It is hardly necessary to observe that no vessel was found ruptured within the cranium. The results of these experiments, in the way of illustration, as applied to the case with a view to which they were instituted, are in no wise clear and satisfactory ; but, on that account I have not thought it right to keep them back, believing that as they have been faithfully detailed, they may be not altogether unacceptable or without use, especially in connexion with the important and obscure subject of aneurism.

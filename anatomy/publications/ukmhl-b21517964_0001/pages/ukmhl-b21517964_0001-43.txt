ON THE TORPEDO. 23 excepting the imparting permanent magnetism to tiie steel needle. The last effect, as might be expected, has required greater force ; a moderate force, how- ever, has been sufficient when a very slender needle has been used, and a spiral of fine wire closely coiled, only just capable of receiving the needle.* The few experiments which I have made on the torpedo, analogous to those instituted by Mr. Todd, described by him in the Philosophical Transactions for 1816, have afforded very similar results. When the brain has been divided longitudinally, the fish has continued to give shocks. When the brain has been entirely extracted, the fish instantly lost this power, though the muscles generally continued to act powerfully;â€”nor could any shock be procured in this instance, either by puncturing with a sharp instrument the electrical nerves, where they quit the cavity of the cranium, or where they enter the electrical organs, just after passing between the branchial cartilages. On one occasion, however, it may be mentioned, that when a small portion of the brain was accidentally left, contiguous to the elec- trical nerves of one side, and with which they were connected, then the fish, on being irritated (the remaining portion of brain was touched) gave a shock to an assistant who grasped the corresponding electrical organ. * The spiral wire above alluded to, is fine copper-wire gilt, having about 300 convolutions to the inch; an inch of it weighed Ibur- fenths of a grain.

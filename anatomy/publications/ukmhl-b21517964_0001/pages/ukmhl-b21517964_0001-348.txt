FLUID IN THE 3*28 pletely obstructed by coagula, in part consisting of fibrin, softened, and of imperfect purulent-like ap- pearance, and in part of crassamentum little altered. There were no tubercles in the lungs; no ulcers in the air-passage or alimentary canal. The vasa deferentia were examined six hours after death, and the vesiculae thirty-six hours after. The very little fluid procured from the former, contained numerous minute globules, and some of a larger size, but no animalcules. No animalcules either were found in the fluid of the vesiculae, merely globules of different sizes. The fluid contained in them was in a very small quantity, of a light brownish hue, and it did not change the colour of turmeric paper. 17.—Aged 31 ; died of pulmonary consumption. The dissection was made twenty-five hours after death. The body was greatly emaciated. Besides tubercles, which abounded in the lungs, and tuber- cular excavations, there was some oedema of these organs, and hepatization and emphysema,—the last to a considerable extent,* with much redness of, and purulent discharge on the bronchia. The in- testines were not ulcerated. * Contiguous to the part where the emphysema was most re- markable, was a small cavity, which communicated by an ulcerated opening with the air-cells of the lungs. When the part was punc- tured under water, several cubic inches of air escaped from the emphysematous portion. It consisted of eight of azote by measure, and two of carbonic acid gas. In many other instances in which I have examined the air of emphysema of the lungs, I have found it similar.

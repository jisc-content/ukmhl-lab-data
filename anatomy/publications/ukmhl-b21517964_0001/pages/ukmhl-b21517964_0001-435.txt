ANATOMICAL PREPARATIONS IN HOT CLIMATES. 415 changes which animal matter undergoes at a tempe- rature between 80 and 90° Fahrenheit (the average maximum of the highest temperature, in the hottest seasons, even in intertropical climates), do not differ in kmd from those which occur at a temperature between 45° and 55°, and d fortiori between 55° and 70°, which maybe considered about the average in-door temperature of the winter and summer sea- sons in Great Britain. The difference then in the changes is chiefly in degree: in a hot climate they take place more rapidly, than in a temperate one, twice or thrice as rapidly, according to the elevation of temperature. This should always be kept in mind as a maxim, and principle ; and to ensure suc- cess in making anatomical preparations, the rapidity of change of animal matter must be met with pro- portional quickness and energy of the conservative processes of art opposed to the destructive ones of nature. With the same view, and against the same tendency to change and decompose, besides quick- ness, great neatness, and cleanliness are requisite. Every dissection should be conducted in a regular and scientific manner, according to a certain method, and with definite objects in view. The principal objects of all dissection are three: the detection of the effects of the disease, and the cause of death ; the removal of diseased parts for preservation ; and the acquisition of general anatomical knowledge. Neatness, and cleanliness, and method, conduce equally to these objects. Attending to them, ob-

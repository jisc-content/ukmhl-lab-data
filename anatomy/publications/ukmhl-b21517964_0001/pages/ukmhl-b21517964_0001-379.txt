ACID TO ANATOMICAL PURPOSES. 359 that the lens still may be employed to heighten the effect and convey still more minute information of the object. I shall enter into some details in illustration. All the descriptions will be taken from preparations from the human subject. The skin immersed in the sulphurous acid swells considerably, and the cuticle is either thrown off or easily detached. The cuticle of the sole of the foot, to mention a particular instance, is rendered almost transparent, and is but little thickened. When held between the eye and the light, its symmetrical struc- ture is beautifully shewn, with innumerable dotted points, as it were, in the course of its linear waving, which probably serve the purpose of pores. If the cuticle, detached by means of sulphurous acid, is dried, it shews its peculiar structure still more dis- tinctly and elegantly. The cutis, distended by the sulphurous acid, ap- pears as a tissue of extremely minute fibres and par- ticles, condensed towards the outer surface, where in contact with the cuticle, and loose internally, where it gradually blends itself with the adipose texture.* Serous membranes, immersed in the acid, swell considerably, and lose very little of their transpar- ency. The inner surface of a portion of pericardium, • In the scrotum and eye-lids,—the transition is into cellular tex- ture ; the surface of the cutis appears as the boundary merely of the cellular tissue a little condensed.

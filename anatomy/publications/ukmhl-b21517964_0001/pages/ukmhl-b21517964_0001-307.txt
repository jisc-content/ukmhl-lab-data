ON THE SKIN. 287 In the skin of the white, even in the parts dis- coloured, as in the areola already mentioned, I have not been able to discover any traces of a corpus mucosum, when the cuticle has been separated by means of immersion in the sulphurous acid. I have found the brown colouring matter, as before noticed, impregnating the surface of the cutis, and to be separated with difficulty by scraping it. In the case of the Negro, the colouring matter is deposited more thickly, and more in the form of a membrane; yet I have not been able to detach it as a mem- brane, and only in very minute portions, and that by scraping, when the cuticle has been raised and separated with as little inflammation as possible. The evidence in favour of the existence of a corpus mucosum, obtained either by maceration of the in- teguments, or by the application of blisters, appears to be very doubtful. By the first process, a gela- tinous or mucus-like surface may be formed ; by the second, a false membrane may be produced by the effusion of coagulable lymph, exactly resembling a corpus mucosum. I do not make these remarks hypothetically, but from experience,—from obser- the three mineral acids, and a solution of potash, when heated, and by the sulphurous acid. By the former, both are dissolved; by the sulphurous acid, they are rendered of a light brown coloui-. They are not dissolved by these acids, or by the alkali, when cold; nor is their colour changed by a solution of chlorine in water,— contrary to what is commonly asserted of the colouring matter of the skin of the Negro. Both bear a high degree of temperature, ap- parently without change, viz. that nearly of a dull red heat.

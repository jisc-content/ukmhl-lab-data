ANATOMICAL PREPARATIONS IN HOT CLIMATES. 421 attention to suspending it in a natural way, that it may be properly seen, becomes (unless it be some very simple structure) misshapen, distorted, and con- fused. A preparation in such a state, it is very difficult afterwards to amend: this is well known to those who have had occasion to attempt the annoy- ing task of endeavouring “ to make something” of a preparation, perhaps highly interesting in itself, which has been thus neglected in the first instance. It may perhaps be thought that the measure just recommended is not easily carried into effect; that to accomplish it much art and skill are requisite; and that glass vessels in plenty, and of various sizes, are indispensable. This, fortunately, is not the case; very moderate skill is sufficient, such as every medical man ought to possess, and must possess, if he is fond of his profession, and only tolerably zealous in the pursuit of it. And instead of many glass vessels, one or two are amply sufficient for holding all the prepara- tions a professional man is likely to be able to collect in one year in the course of his ordinary practice. A glass vessel of the capacity of a gallon, with a large mouth closed either with a cork enveloped in cerate-cloth, or a glass stopper, is very convenient for the object in question. The preparation neatly dissected, may be advantageously attached by a thread, the outer end of which should also be smeared with cerate; or if the preparation is lighter than spirit, as a portion of lung containing air, the same

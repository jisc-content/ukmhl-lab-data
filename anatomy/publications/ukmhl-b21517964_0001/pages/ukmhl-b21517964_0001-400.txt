I have now be- fore me a thoracic duct, which has been kept in dis- tilled vinegar nine years, and it could not be shewn better were it injected with mercury; with this ad- vantage on the part of the acid,—that, whilst by distension it shews the form of the vessel, it also, where the vessel is laid open, shews its valvular structure. From my own experience, I believe I am not too sanguine in expressing, confidently, my opinion, that both the anatomist and pathologist, engaged in re- search, may derive very material help from the use of this acid, and the latter, especially, as it is well fitted to bring to light diseased structure, of such minuteness or obscurity, as to escape detection by the senses unaided.* There are other uses to which this acid is appli- cable, some of which, as connected with my present subject, I shall briefly advert to. On account of its antiseptic quality, I believe, distilled vinegar, may be often usefully employed in surgery, in washing foul ulcers and in washing out abscesses deeply seated, containing offensive and * Minute ulcers in the intestines and loss of the villous structure, I have several times detected and made apparent by immersion in this acid, not perceptible in ordinary examination.

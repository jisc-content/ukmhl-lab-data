76 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS spotted and non-spotted of Bellon, there does not appear to me to be a doubt. But it appears more than doubtful, if any other true species exist in this sea.* I draw this conclusion from multiplied observations made both at Rome and in Malta. That these fish, the occhiatella and tremola, are dis- tinct species, admits of satisfactory proof.f They differ not only in their colour and general appearance, but also somewhat in their form. The occhiatella is more gracefully made than the tremola; its fins are larger, especially its dorsal fins; its water-valves are larger and different in shape; and the openings behind the eyes to wRich they belong, are guarded by much smaller projections than protect those passages in the tremola. And internally there is a remarkable difference in the structure of the villous coat of the uterine cavity; in the occhiatella, the villi are filamentous and detached, as represented in fig. 1, Plate II. ; in the tremola they are continuous * Probably in other seas there are other species of this fish. Dr. Andrew Smith informs me, that at the Cape of Good Hope there are two species, perfectly distinct from those of the Mediterranean; one of them indeed belonging to a different subgenus, well marked. It is his intention to describe them, in his interesting and able work, now in progress of publication, on the Zoology of Southern Africa. t Cuvier, in the edition of his Regne Animal of 1830, distinguishes the occhiatella by its spots, and by the absence “ de dentelures char- nues au bord de ses Events.” This does not hold good of any of the species which I have examined. The cartilaginous projections (which they really are) covered with cutis, I have found only smaller in the occhiatella, not absent.

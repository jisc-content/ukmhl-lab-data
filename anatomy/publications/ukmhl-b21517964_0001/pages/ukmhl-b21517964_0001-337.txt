VESICUL.E SEMINALES OF MAN. 3lT dissection was made fourteen hours after death. The body was much emaciated. Besides tubercles in different stages, and excavations in the lungs, and partial hepatization, there was little other organic disease. Diarrhoea had not preceded death; there were, however, some small ulcers in the colon, and marks of old ulcers healed. The vesiculre and the vasa deferentia were ex- amined sixteen hours after death. A small drop of fluid was obtained from the latter, of cream or purulent-like appearance, which abounded in seminal animalcules. The vesiculse were moderately turgid; the fluid in them was also opaque, white, like puru- lent matter, and abounded in animalcules. The animalcules in each instance were dead. Neither fluid changed the colour of litmus or of turmeric paper. 6.â€”Aged 39; died of gangrene of the superior lobe of right lung, complicated with effusion into the pleura, and with ascites. There were sixty-one ounces of turbid serum in the right pleura, and seven pints of serum in the cavity of the abdomen. The liver, spleen, and pancreas were denser than natural; the weight of the liver was only two and a-half pounds. There was a large ulcer in the caecum, and numerous marks of old ulcerations healed in the colon and rectum. Chronic dysentery preceded the fatal disease. The dissection was made twenty- eight hours after death. The right vas deferens was examined two hours

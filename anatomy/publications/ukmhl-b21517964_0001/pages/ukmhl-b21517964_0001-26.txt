6 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS powerfully attracted them. This experiment I have repeated many times with fishes of different sizes, some larger and some smaller, and with the same result whenever the fish has been active, and the contacts similarly made. The next trial instituted on the electricity of the torpedo was on the multiplier; it was one which belonged to my brother, the needle was poised on a pivot, and was not very sensible. The precaution was taken to insulate the instrument well, by smear- ing with sealing wax the feet of the stand supporting the coil. The same wires for contact were used in this as in the former experiments, and the junctions were carefully made. Applying one wire to the under surface, and the other to the upper surface, using the fish first mentioned, and after an interval of only two hours, I succeeded in obtaining decisive results; the first shock had a powerful effect, the needle made half a revolution : and other trials were in accordance. The needle, by active fishes, was generally thrown into violent motion, occasionally describing nearly a circle, and even by the feeblest it was distinctly affected. I have met with no in- stance of a fish which had the power of magne- tising a needle in the spiral wire, failing to move the needle in the multiplier; but I have met with more than one example of a fish, whose elec- tricity was equal to the latter effect, and not to the former. I have not mentioned, in my paper in the Philo-

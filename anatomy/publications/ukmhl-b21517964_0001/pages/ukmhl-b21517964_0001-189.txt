AND OTHER ANIMALS. 169 drank only one glass of wine; and, lastly, from nine to eleven was most of the time employed in writing. It would be tedious to give other instances illus- trative of the change of the temperature of man,— increasing with the temperature of the air, and fall- ing as the atmosphere cools within certain bounds. The preceding instance, which has been confirmed by various experiments I have made, is the most minute and satisfactory that I. can bring forward. The subject is inconvenient to make experiments on, and particularly for a person whose time is not his own, and, as a professional man, has seldom a day of leisure, the whole of which he can spend as he chooses. Nor is it easy in this inquiry to arrive at accurate results,—at any thing more than an approximation to the truth,—in consequence of the effects of a number of circumstances, and particularly of health, diet, and exercise, which cannot be duly appreciated until they have been more minutely investigated. 2.— Of the Temperature of different Races of Men. At the Cape of Good Hope, at the Isle of France, and in Ceylon, I have had opportunities of trying the temperature of several different races of men. At the Cape, in the winter of 1816, on the 24th of May, at noon, when the temperature of the air was about 60°, I prevailed, with some difficulty, on five Hottentots, to allow me to put a thermometer into their mouths, for they were afraid of the instru-

ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BODY. 201 when the air was 92", I suddenly ordered them to stop, that I might ascertain their temperature. The first mentioned man, was one of the bearers carrying the palankeen, the other had been running by its side; both were sweating, the latter most profusely. The temperature of the first, under the tongue, was 98", in the axilla 98*25; of the second, under the tongue, 99"; in the axilla 9(>'5.* There are, on record, many instances of sudden death,—from drinking cold water, or from plunging into cold water, after exhausting fatigue, and when the body is commonly said to be heated. Probably in such cases, in conformity with the above observa- tions, the temperature of the body has been actually reduced below its natural standard, taking the tongue as an index of the internal heat, and the fatal effect may, in part, be the consequence. This view of the effect was taken by the late Dr. Currie, who, in his Medical Reports, in the twelfth chapter, has collect- ed many examples of the kind, and, amongst them, that interesting and impressive one of the catastrophe which befell the army of Alexander the Great, on * I shall mention one observation more.—On the 10th September, 1817, after walking four miles over a very rugged road, in the in- terior of Ceylon, and sweating profusely; when the sensation of heat was greatest, a thermometer, placed under my tongue, was 98°, the temperature of the air at the time was 88°. These observations arc too few in number to admit of conclusions being drawn from them in a satisfactory manner. Few, however, as they are, the results are not uninteresting, especially those indicating a reduction of temperature under the tongue.

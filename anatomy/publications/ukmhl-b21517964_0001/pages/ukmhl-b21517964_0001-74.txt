EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS .54 needles in a spiral connected with the galvanometer. The galvanometer was powerfully affected, as in the first instance, but the needles were not sensibly magnetised: the trial was twice or thrice made with the same results. Next, a shock was received. Mr. Owen, to whose kind offices I was in part in- debted for the permission I had obtained, had pre- pared me from the mention of his own experience, to expect that this would not be contemptible: it rather exceeded than fell short of my expectations: the sensation was rather like that imparted by a Leyden vial than the voltaic battery; more acute, less benumbing than that of the torpedo; and it reached higher, even beyond the elbows.* I did not extend the trials further, nor attempt to test it as a chemical agent, having been informed that ' Mr. Faraday, who preceded me in experimenting on this fish, had carefully investigated its influence in relation to this point. Since that time this gentleman has communi- cated the results which he obtained to the Royal Society, from the Proceedings of which it would * At the obliging suggestions of Mr. Bradley, by whose directions every assistance I could wish was afforded me, the insulated wires had attached to them bent pieces of sheet-copper, in the form of a saddle, for better contact with the fish. These were used in the two first experiments, and also in a fourth, when I had the pleasure of witnessing the production of sparks,—according to the method by w’hich M. Matteucci, in 1836, succeeded when experimenting on the torpedo, and Mr. Faraday recently on this fish; in the third trial, the hands were applied immediately to the surface of the fish.

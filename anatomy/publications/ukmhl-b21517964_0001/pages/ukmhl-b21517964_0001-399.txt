379 ON ANIMAL TEXTURES. arresting it, when commenced and in full activity. So soon as the putrefying part is plunged into the acid, the destructive change is stopped, and the part may be preserved without farther change ; and thus shew the effect of putrefaction on the texture in the stage in which it was arrested. But, although the acid stops putrefaction, it does not, like the sulphurous acid and corrosive sublimate, destroy the principle on which the change depends, or effect an elementary change, incompatible with its taking place. I find that parts transferred from acid to water, and well washed, undergo putrefaction under favourable circumstances,â€”but much more slowly than if they had never been in contact with the acid : and, the changes which take place in them, seem to be, in some respects, different from those resulting from ordinary putrefaction, and are, per- haps, peculiar. In its action on different textures, in relation to its visible effects, it very much resembles the sul- phurous acid. Its expansive power is similar; its power of increasing the transparency of cellular tissue and of the diaphanous membranes is also similar. And, in consequence, like that acid, it is well fitted to shew the structure of many compound parts, and the minute structure of many organs. I have mentioned preparations of different portions of the alimentary canal, preserved for two years in di- lute acid. Without the aid of a lens, the peculiar structure of each division may now be distinctly

280 TWO CASES OF two following instances, which have since come under my observation. On the 23d of May, 1823, on examining the body of a soldier, who had died of chronic dysentery, complicated with an ulcer in the larynx, the cellular membrane in both mediastina was found vesicular and distended with air. The vesicles were burst under water, and a half cubic inch of air was col- lected, which was found to consist of 7 oxygen 4 carbonic acid 89 azote. The surrounding parts were carefully examined ; particularly the trachea, lungs and oesophagus, but no passage could be detected through which air could have entered the mediastina; nor could any air be forced into them by distending the lungs by means of a double bellows. It may be, that the oxygen found in the mixed airs, was extraneous and derived partly from common air adhering to the surface of the cellular membrane, and partly from air of the atmosphere penetrating through the deli- cate vesicles during the preparatory dissection, when they were exposed to its influence, for half an hour at least. On the 2nd of June of the same year, in ex- amining the body of a soldier, aged 36, who had died of tubercular consumption, I found air-vesicles on the surface of the lungs, similar to those de-

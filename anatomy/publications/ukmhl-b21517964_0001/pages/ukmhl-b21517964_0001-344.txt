FLUID IN THE 324 hue, slightly opaque, contained some globules, and did not change the colour of turmeric or of litmus O paper. The fluid from their fundus was most gela- tinous, and appeared to consist chiefly of mucus.* 13.â€”Aged 29 ; died of pulmonary consumption, complicated with peritonseal inflammation. The dissection was made twenty-seven hours after death. The body was exceedingly emaciated; the lungs were very voluminous and heavy; they contained a vast number of tubercles in different stages, some small cavities and one large one. This cavity was lined with a false membrane, which was even spread over the abrupt mouths of two or three bronchial tubes, and it was empty. Whether it was distended with air, or its sides pressed together, was not ascer- tained. Eight pints of serum were collected in the cavity of the abdomen. There were very numerous adhesions between the viscera. The omentum abounded in granular tubercles, and resembled an elongated pancreas. The crecum was misplaced, and with the colon was confined to the left side. The ileum, appendicula vermiformis, and colon, were severely ulcerated. The appearances indicated a perforation of the appendicula by ulceration, after- wards closed by adhesion, and which probably gave rise to the peritonaeal inflammation. The abdominal disease was not suspected during life. No fluid could be obtained from the vasa defer- t * The vesicula? seminales, and their contents, in this instance, re- sembled those of such castrated animals as I have hitherto examined.

TWO CASES OF 268 along the whole tract of the primae vise, and over the whole of the external surface of the body.* Case II. Patrick Calnon, of the 50th regiment, was ad- mitted into the General Hospital at Fort Pitt, on the 9th of May, 1823, on his return from Jamaica, from whence he was sent home invalided on account of haemoptysis, attributed to a severe fall on the left side of the chest, eighteen months pre- viously. Before the accident, his health had been uninterruptedly good. Until the 13th of May, his complaint exhibited nothing peculiar. Early on the morning of that day, after a violent fit of coughing, the symptoms of pneumathorax began to appear; and they conti- * Many facts which, since the above was written, have been brought to light, especially by the researches of Dr. Edw^ards, might be adduced in corroboration of the remark in the text. In the winter of 1838, I examined the series of cells, filled with air, which occur in that beautiful osseous structure, the vertebral column of the wdld swan. The contained air, I found composed of 83â€™3 azote 16'7 oxygen. The examination was made two days after the bird had been shot: probably during life, the proportion of azote is greater. Probably, wherever air penetrates in birds, whether into the abdominal air- cavities, or the osseous ones, there is a continued absorption of oxygen going on, giving rise to several effects connected wdth the economy of this class of animals, as buoyancy, high aeration of blood, and high animal temperature.

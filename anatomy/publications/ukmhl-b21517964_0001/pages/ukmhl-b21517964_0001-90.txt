70 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS paring an apparatus to try its electricity, which occupied me about five minutes. But it was too late, the fish was then motionless. As soon as the apparatus was ready, I opened the cavity of the abdomen, hoping that, if gravid, as asserted by the fishermen, the young might still be alive. From each uterine cavity three fish were extracted; but they were all dead,â€”neither in air, nor in salt water, did they show any the slightest signs of irritability, though they had no appearance of being bruised, or in any way injured. The size of each was nearly the same; the only difference I could perceive was a little variation in the magnitude of the external yolk- bag; in two it had all but disappeared; it was smaller than a barley corn; in the other two it was a little larger, and in the two others, perhaps, a little larger still. The internal yolk was very large and about the same size in all. Their organization generally appeared to be complete, even to their teeth. The next fish that I obtained near its full time was a tremola, on the 29th Sept. It had been caught an hour or two before, and was in a very languid state, having been put into a vessel contain- ing only just sufficient water to cover it. It was tried on the multiplier, but it did not affect the needle. When moribund, the abdomen was opened, and I extracted with the hand, without experiencing any shock, from the two uterine cavities, twelve foetal fish, and one which had been expelled before, and was alive and swimming about, made thirteen. They were

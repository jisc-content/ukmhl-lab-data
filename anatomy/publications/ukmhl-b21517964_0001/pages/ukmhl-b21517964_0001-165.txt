ON ANIMAL HEAT. 145 was obtained from a sheep ; and one day tlie vein was opened, and on the next the artery. The capacity of the bottle employed exceeded that of the first by one ounce measure of water; but it was equally thin. The air of the room was of temperature 69^*- Water cooled from 120'" to 80° in 118 minutes. Venous blood in - - 112 Arterial blood in - - 113 And hence, as the latter was of specific gravity 1049, its capacity for heat seems to be as 913; and as the former was of specific gravity 1051, its capacity appears to be 903. In the following experiment, equal volumes of fluid blood and of water were used, which was easily accomplished by means of a thin bottle with a large mouth, to which a cork was adapted, with a perforation more than sufficiently large to admit the bulb of a very delicate thermometer, and of course to allow, when the bottle was filled to the brim, tbe excess to flow out on the introduction of the cork, which was always similarly placed. To retard the process of cooling, the bottle was closely sur- rounded by a thick layer of what is commonly called cotton wool. Its capacity was equal to five ounce measures of water, or 2400 grains. It was first filled with cold water, which, when its temperature had been ascertained, was thrown into the receiver before used ; it was next filled with hot water, of tempera- ture about 110°, so that the heat of the glass might be nearly the same as that of the blood ; and, lastly^ VOL.

450 EXPERIMENTS ON THE RUPTURE OF THE connexion with the diseased omentum and enlarged liver,) were previously shrunk and emaciated.* Experiment 16. The sternum having been removed and the peri- cardium laid open, water was again injected into the right carotid artery, other circumstances remaining the same. The arch of the aorta, as much as could be seen of it, was greatly distended: but the left ventricle was not at all distended. No force that could be used could rupture the aorta,—the exudation continuing. Laid open carefully the left ventricle so as to be able to apply the end of the * Hales, in his Haemastatics, details many curious and instructive results of experiments on the injection of water into the vessels. In an experiment on a dog, he states ; “ If the warm water was conti- nued thus ” (in a column 9^ feet high) “ flowing into the artery for half an hour, or two hours, all the parts of the body, would, during that time, be continually swelling bigger and bigger, so that there would be an universal dropsy over the whole body; both the ascites and the anasarca: the salival and other glands were greatly swelled, and the mouth and nose filled with mucose slimy matter, which flowed from those glands; the ubera were much distended by the filling of their fat vesicles, as were also all the fatty vesicles of the body. All the muscles were swelled, and the interstices of their fibres filled with water; and some of them were by this means washed white. All this was effected with a force of water no greater than that of arterial blood in its natural state.”—Stat. Essay, 3d ed. vol. ii. p. 113. With these results, the above, and what else was observed at the same time, so accorded, that in reading the one, I found described the other, substituting perhaps for fatty vesicles when speaking of the uhera, their erectile vascular tissue, and for the same term generally, cellular tissue, or the subcutaneous vascular.

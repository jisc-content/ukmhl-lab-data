ON THE TORPEDO. 55 appear that, besides the spark, he has witnessed all the effects known to have been produced by the electricity of the torpedo. Reasoning from my own comparative results on the electricity of the torpedo and gymnotus, it appears to me difficult to avoid the conclusion, that the power of each, whatever it may be in essence, is modified in its manifestations, or effects; the difference between the electricities of the two fishes in imparting shocks, and in magnetising steel, was too strongly marked to be any wise doubtful. 5.â€” On the Fcetal Development of the Torpedo. The accounts we possess by different naturalists, of the mode of generation of the torpedo, are very discordant and perplexing, and consequently it is a fit subject for further research. It may be advisable to premise a few particulars respecting its generative organs. The female, like those rays and squali which are considered ovivipa- rous, has two ovaria, a common oviduct, and two uterine cavities.* The ovaria, one on each side of the spine, are attached to, and enveloped in, a fold of the peritonseum, just above the liver, and a very little below the common infundibulum or opening of the oviduct. The oviduct passes round, on each side under the liver, and ends in an enlargement. * Vide Plate II.

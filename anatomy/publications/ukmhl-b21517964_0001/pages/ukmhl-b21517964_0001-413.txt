ANIMAL MATTER IN DIFFERENT BONES. 3Q3 No. Description of Bone. Calcar. Matter. .\nimal Matter. 8 Hollow summits of teeth of inferior jaw of a foetus, between five and six months, several years preserved in spirit of wine, (they weighed only -4 gr.) enamel not deposited 75-5 25-0 9 Under-jaw of the same, connected by ligament at symphysis, deprived of periosteum, nerve, «&c. thoroughly dried, weighed only 8‘5 grs. 56-0 44-0 10 Portion of parietal bone of a Maltese woman, set. 98: very thick and heavy, abounding in stearine ...... 47-6 52-4 11 Portion of parietal bone of a Maltese woman, set. 83; unusually thick: it contained very little fatty matter ..... 66-0 34-0 12 The occipital bone of an old man, from Dr. Monro’s museum ..... 69-0 31-0 13 A part of the lower jaw of an old person, be- tween the symphysis and processes: the alveoli were absorbed, the bone brittle 56-6 43-4 14 Portion of radius from an old woman whose bones had been frequently broken, and were supposed to be peculiarly brittle, from Mr. Liston’s museum .... 66-0 34-0 15 Molar tooth of a man, set. 61: weighed 31 '9 grs. 73-6 26-4 The bones noticed in this Second Table, with the exception of those from Dr. Monro’s museum, were thoroughly dried previous to incineration.

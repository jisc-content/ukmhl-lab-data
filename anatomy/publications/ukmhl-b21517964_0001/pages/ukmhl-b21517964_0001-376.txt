35G ON THE APPLICATION OF SULPHUROUS agitating the water, when the sulphur ceases to burn, and, when the water is sufficiently impregnated with the acid gas, filtering the solution, to render it transparent and clear. Its durability, to a certain extent, I infer from many circumstances. In December, 1827, when I communicated an account of the effects of the acid to the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh, in the third volume of whose Transactions it was pub- lished, I had preparations by me, which had then been made nearly three years,—nothing further had been done to them,—no fluid had been added,—no evaporation had taken place, and they then appear- ed as perfect as when they were first immersed in the acid, and merely confined in a bottle with a glass stopper, lubricated with a little cerate. Other con- siderations induced me to think favourably of its preservative powers. From experiments I had pre- viously made, the sulphurous acid appeared to have nearly the same power in preventing the putrefaction of animal matter, as it has of stopping the fermenta- answers well. The sulphur may he introduced kindled, in a small gallipot, attached to a strong wire. As soon as the flame expires the sulphur should he quickly withdraAvn, the cork replaced, and the vessel agitated, that the water may absorb the acid gas formed. After agitation for about half a minute, the cork should he taken out,— and fresh atmospheric air supplied by blowing into the jar with a common bellows ; the burning of the sulphur may then be repeated, and the process so continued, until the water is sufficiently strongly impregnated. Hard water should be avoided; for, if the water con- tain any lime, it will render the solution turbid,—a fault which even filtering will not perfectly correct.

AND OTHER ANIMALS. 1 i ( 1 ^ ^ The ages of these men I was obliged to guess, for they themselves could not inform me. They belonged to a large party who had come to Kandy, with a tribute of dried deerâ€™s flesh and wild honey. They were quite naked with the exception of the paries naturales, which were concealed by a scrap of cloth. The hair of their head and beard was long and matted, and had never been cut or combed. Their eyes were lively, wild, and restless. They were well made and muscular, but of a spare habit, and in person they chiefly differed from the Kandians in the slightness of their limbs, the wildness of their looks, and their savage appearance. According to their own account of themselves, they came from the neighbourhood of the Lake of Bintenne, where they subsisted on game which they killed in the chase, some roots, and wild fruits, and a little grain of their own growing. They were profoundly ig- norant, could not count above five, were hardly acquainted with the rudiments of any art, and though they ieared demons as they did wild beasts, they had no knowledge whatever of a Supreme benefi- cent Being, and not the slightest notion of any state of existence after the present. Yet, these men considered themselves civilized in comparison with the wilder tribes of Vaidas, who never leave their native forests, and who attack with their sylvan weapons, the bow and arrow, every intruder into their haunts, and whom I have heard Kandians of a bordering province describe as living almost entirely VOL.

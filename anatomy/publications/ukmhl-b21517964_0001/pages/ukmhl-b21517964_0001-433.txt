THE URINARY BLADDER AFTER DEATH. 413 minute living animalcules were seen in the urine under microscopic examination. I believe they came from the bladder; but it is right to state, I am not certain that they did, as the vials in which the fluid was received, had previously held pump- water. In using the microscope it is impossible to })roceed with too much caution, or to be too scepti- cal, especially when the results are in any wise ex- traordinary. Further, reverting to them, it appears, that in several instances, viz. in cases Nos. 11, 14, 22, 24, and 25, spermatic animalcules were detected in the urine. Of the nature of these animalcules, there could be no question, their forms were so distinct. Nor can there be, I apprehend, any doubt enter- tained that they had been collected previously in the vesiculse seminales. Probably in the convulsion of death, which is often accompanied with the dis- charge of a portion of the contents of these organs, some of the fluid may have been irregularly pro- pelled into the urinary bladder.

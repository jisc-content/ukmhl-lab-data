442 EXPERIMENTS ON THE RUPTURE OF THE auricle was the seat of it; it was sufficiently large to admit the finger. Experiment 3. Made a similar experiment on the aorta. It ex- panded but little; it was ruptured about one inch from its origin, and to the extent nearly of one half of its circumference. The pipe of the syringe was introduced just below the arteria innominata. The semilunar valves performed their function perfectly, and were found uninjured. Experiment 4. Made a similar experiment on the pulmonary artery. Introduced the pipe of the syringe into one of its main branches, and secured the other by ligature. It dilated more than the aorta, and con- siderably ; its rupture took place before much force had been employed; it was transverse, about one half the circumference of the vessel, and through all its coats, and about half an inch above the valves, which acted well and were uninjured. Experiment 5. Tied the pulmonary artery, and descending vena cava, and forced in water through the ascending vena cava: when but little force had been used, and when the auricle and ventricle were not very much distended, a rupture took place, which on ex- amination was found to be of the fossa ovalis; the

ACCOUNT OF EXPERIMENTS 142 Such were the inducements that led me to the consideration of each of these subjects apart, and to endeavour to acquire by experiment some more certain knowledge respecting them. The experi- ments that I have made will be described in the two following sections, and in the last will be offered the few remarks and conclusions which naturally arise, and are fairly deducible from the results. 1.â€” On the Capacities of Venous and Arterial Blood for Heat. I must premise, that my object has been to endea- vour to ascertain the relative capacities of venous and arterial blood for heat, rather than their exact specific caloric. The latter, from many circumstances, is difficult to be accomplished ; whilst the former is comparatively easy, and, in a theoretical point of view is probably equally useful. I have employed both the methods commonly used. I shall mention most of the experiments that I have made, without noticing the repetitions of them, and shall begin with those on the times of cooling of equal volumes of venous and arterial blood. The blood used was from the jugular vein, and the carotid artery, of a lamb about four months old. It w^as received in bottles, and to remove the fibrin, which is a great impediment in experiments of this kind, it was immediately stirred with a wooden rod. In respect to colour, the difference between the

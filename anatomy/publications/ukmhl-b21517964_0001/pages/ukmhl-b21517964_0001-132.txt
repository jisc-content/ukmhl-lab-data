112 THE ACRID FLUID SECRETED, ETC. bubble was visible—forced either through the skin or through the lungs. When dried, the skin of the toad, I find, exhibits two kinds of pores ; one kind, few in number, con- fined to the tuberosities over the shoulders, suffi- ciently large to receive a hog’s bristle ; the other kind, very numerous, scattered over the whole surface, and very minute. Both of them were best seen by holding the skin between the eye and a strong light; the smallest appeared as luminous points of a yellow hue, the largest as indistinct circles. Both were covered externally with transparent cuticle, and internally by a delicate surface of cellular tissue ; some of the largest were also covered with rete mucosum; the smallest appeared to be destitute of this membrane : both, I believe, are destitute of the superficial layer or crust already mentioned, consist- ing chiefly of phosphate of lime. W^hether these apparent pores are the medium of communication between the blood in the subcuta- neous capillary vessels and the atmosphere, or whether they are merely parts of the cutaneous apparatus of secretion and exudation, it is difficult to determine ; it is not improbable that they per- form both functions : the experiments of Spallan- zani, and the very ingenious ones of Dr. Edwards, on what has been denominated cutaneous respiration, may be considered as demonstrative, that they per- form at least the first-named function.

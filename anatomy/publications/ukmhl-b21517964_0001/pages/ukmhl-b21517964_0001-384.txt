364 ON THE APPLICATION OF SULPHUROUS or vessels twice or thrice the size of those of the mucous coat of the stomach ; and, as the duodenum descends, the appearance strengthens. In some preparations there is an appearance of follicles, and of circular depressions, but not in all I have exa- mined ; and, when seen, they are most distinctly seen with the naked eye. A longitudinal section, including the pylorus, strikingly and invariably shews a layer of a minute glandular structure,* em- bracing and belonging to the mucous coat of the duodenum, which terminates abruptly at the pylo- rus, but gradually in the contrary direction, and dis- appearing, or nearly so, about an inch and a-half from the pylorus. The same section, too, shews how very thick the muscular and cellular coats of the stomach are, in comparison with those of the duodenum. The inner coat of the jejunum, viewed with the naked eye, in sulphurous acid, appears to be dis- tinctly villous, or as if studded with innumerable projecting capillary points; but this appearance vanishes when it is examined with a common lens; then, in some lights, it appears to be covered with convoluted threads, having a kind of centre, round which they are described, which, to the unaided eye, seems a minute mucous gland ; and, in other lights, as minute projecting laminae variously bent. â™¦ The glands of Brunner, first described in 1687, and called by him, not inaptly, pancreas securidarhan.

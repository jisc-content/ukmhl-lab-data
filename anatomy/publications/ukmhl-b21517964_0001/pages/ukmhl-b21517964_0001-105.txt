ON THE TORPEDO. 85 The mucous system of the torpedo, which I have already briefly noticed, is well deserving of attention, the skeleton of other fishes of the same great order is similar. I have hitherto only examined a few specimens: the results were in perfect accordance with the analogy. All the fishes of this order are peculiarly endowed with means of defence, and in a large number of instances with those of offence, both curiously various. Thus the squali with powerful teeth and fins, well adapted to their fierce and predatory habits, have crus- taceous integuments of stony hai-dness, and great toughness, pos- sessing much power of resistance, and consequently well adapted for defence; the outer osseous layer of their skin is, in fact, a natural scale-armour. Take for instance the Ginglymostoma Gata, (Muller) the integuments of which I have carefully examined; the natural armour alluded to, is composed of anvil-like pieces, like the teeth, firmly impacted in the cutis, yet admitting of motion. A specimen of the entire integument, I found, in its dry state, to consist of 29’3 Phosphate and corbonate of lime, with some saline matter. 70‘7 Animal matter. 100-0 The rays, with comparatively feeble fins and teeth, ill fitted for attack, are admirably provided with defensive means; such as the torpedo, with its electricity, the other species, with spines variously distributed. These spines appear to be analagous to the osseous cuticle of the squali. The only ones which I have examined are those of the common thornback. I have found the bony tubercle from which the spine proceeds, composed of 36-2 Phosphate and carbonate of lime, with some saline matter. 21-4 Animal matter. 42-4 Water. 100-0

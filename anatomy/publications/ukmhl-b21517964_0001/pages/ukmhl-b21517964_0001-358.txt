FLUID OF THE 338 instances of chronic diseases of the abdominal viscera, and especially of the intestines. The subject of inquiry is in many respects curious, and some other of its relations are not uninteresting or unimportant. I shall allude to one only before concluding, and that connected with medical juris- prudence. Admitting that spermatic animalcules are charac- teristic of and essential to healthy spermatic fluid, in certain doubtful criminal cases, probably, decisive evidence may be obtained by means of microscopical examination. The spermatic fluid undergoes change rapidly when exposed to the air, and even soon becomes putrid; but the spermatic animalcules, I find, resist change in a remarkable manner. In one instance, distinct remains of these animalcules were observed in putrid fluid, which had been kept ten weeks, at a temperature varying betw'een 50° and 60° of Fahrenheit, and in another which had been kept a year and half. In another instance, some fluid of the vesiculse was applied to linen, and wrapped in paper and put by in a close drawer. It was ex- amined the following day; at the end of a week, and after eighteen days, and each time animalcules were discovered under the microscope. The mode of making the trial was by saturating a small portion of the smeared linen with a few drops of water, and gently pressing out a drop for the experiment. Fragments of the animalcules were very distinct, and sufficiently characteristic ; and on careful inspec-

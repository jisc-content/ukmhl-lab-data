360 ON THE APPLICATION OF SULPHUROUS now before me, has an uneven surface, and exhibits when examined with a common lens, a slight ap- pearance of pores; its section shews as if it were composed of layers, and its outer surface displays a loose intertexture of fine fibres. A portion of pleura, (with the exception of the cut part, which is very much thinner, and not visibly in layers), appears very similar, but less distinct. On the cellular structure, the sulphurous acid has much the same effect as on the serous;—it distends it greatly, and preserves it transparent. On fibrous membranes the sulphurous acid has not much effect; they become swollen in it slightly, and diaphanous. The outer layer of the dura mater, in a specimen before me, is considerably corrugated, whilst the inner has remained smooth, which, per- haps, is owing to the outer being of greater density than the inner, (as it appears to the eye to be); in consequence of which greater density, it is more ex- panded. The sclerotic coat of the eye is equally acted on throughout; and is not in the slightest de- gree wrinkled. The outer surface of the tunica al- buginea testis is corrugated very slightly. It acts more powerfully on tendons and ligaments; and on some more than on others, shewing a striking difference in this respect. The tendons of muscles in general it expands amazingly, and renders semi- transparent. To take an example, — the tendo achillis thus swollen has the appearance of an opal- escent mass, divided pretty regularly into cells, the

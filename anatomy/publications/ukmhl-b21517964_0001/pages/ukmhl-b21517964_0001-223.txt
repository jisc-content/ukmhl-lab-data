203 X. OBSERVATIONS ON THE TEMPERATURE OP THE INSANE. In the Lunatic Asylum at Fort Clarence, attached to the General Military Hospital at Fort Pitt, Chatham, it has commonly been believed that the temperature of the insane is below the average temperature of man. This opinion has chiefly been founded on thermometrical observations, made many years ago by the late Mr. Tully, then surgeon to the forces, in medical charge. As the difference of temperature was, in many instances, stated to be of several degrees, varying from 92° to 97°, as as- certained under the tongue, taking 98° as the standard, I could not avoid entertaining doubts re- specting the accuracy of the results; and this feel- ing induced me to institute some trials, for the pur- pose of endeavouring to arrive at some certainty, on a point not without interest, and importance, both theoretically, and in regard to the manage- ment of the insane. I shall give two sets of obser- vations ;—one set made in the depth of winter,— the other in the height of summer,—under circum- stances, otherwise, as nearly like as possible ;—viz. at the same time Uf the day, between 10 o’clock

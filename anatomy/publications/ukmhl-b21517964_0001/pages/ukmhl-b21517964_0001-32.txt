EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 12 * Philosophical Transactions, 1813, p. 114. fine, and of platina, formed after Dr. Wollaston’s method ;* in having a small stop-cock for regulating the height of the spirit in the stem; and in using as small a quantity of spirit as possible. The small globe or bulb of the thermometer was defended from the variable temperature of the surrounding air, by being included in a wooden box. The delicacy of this instrument was so great, that the spirit in the stem was not only moved by a single spark of the electrical machine, but even very distinctly by the electricity of a single voltaic combination, com- posed of a copper and zinc wire, the former l-25th of an inch in diameter, the latter l-50th, excited by dilute sulphuric acid. This instrument was strongly affected by active fish, and even distinctly by weak ones;—indeed, occasionally, when it formed part of a circle in connexion with a galvanometer, I have seen it affected alone, the galvanometer affording no indica- tion of the passage of the electricity. Using two air-thermometers of the same construction, each connected with the wires for contact at one end, and with the galvanometer at the other, the heating effect of the electricity of the torpedo has been ap- parently diminished, and even more distinctly dimi- nished on adding to the circle another link of very fine platina wire. And at the same time its influence on the galvanometer has been diminished, and its power of imparting permanent magnetism to a needle.

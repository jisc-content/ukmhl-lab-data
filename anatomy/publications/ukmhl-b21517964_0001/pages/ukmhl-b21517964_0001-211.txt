191 AND OTHER ANIMALS. iieart of this fish, which lies very near the surface, was 82", and of the deep-seated muscles 99°- These observations w^ere made immediately after the fish was taken. I may remark, that the heart and gills of this fish were unusually large, and the latter of a dark red colour ; further, that the muscles in general, which were very thick and powerful, were red like those of a porpoise, and that the bonito appears to be as fond of raising its head above the water as the porpoise itself: with these circumstances, probably, its extraordinary temperature is connected. Common Trout.—Near Edinburgh, in the Spring, river 56", the temperature of this fish was 58". Common Trout, Mount Cenis,* in a tank supplied with water flowing perennially from snow, 1 found at 40", at three different seasons of the year, tempera- ture of fish 42", in excellent condition. Trout, about half a pound weight, in cesophago, 58"; water of river, flowing from Loch Katrine into Loch Vanacher, 56”, July 5th. Eel {M. laterostris)^ Chatham, May 14. Tem- perature in air 51”, in oesophago^ 51”. The eel had been out of water several hours. * The trout at Mount Cenis, in a lake about 5000 feet above the level of the sea, is always in season, which perhaps may be owing in part to the temperature of the deep water being probably always about 40°. In accordance with this, I am informed that the same is the case with the Char inhabiting the deep waters of Coniston Lake, in Lancashire, and also, it is said, of the trout of the Sorgue, at Vaucluse, in Provence—a stream which bursts out at the base of a mountain pre- cipice, and the temperature of which probably varies very little through- out the year. On the 10th of April, 1830, I found it 54° at its source.

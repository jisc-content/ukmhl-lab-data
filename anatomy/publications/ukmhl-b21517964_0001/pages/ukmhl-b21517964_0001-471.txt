HEART AND GREAT VESSELS. 451 finger to the semi-lunar valves. Water was again injected forcibly, the aorta was again distended, and there was only an oozing of water from the ventricle: the valves were felt very tense, and, it may be in- ferred, completely closed the mouth of the vessel. Experiment 17. I shall give one trial more, in which— twenty-four hours after death from tubercles in the lungs, with very large cavities in the left lung and extensive ulceration of the large intestines—the pipe of the syringe was introduced into the right carotid artery, before the calvaria was removed, and after tying both jugular veins, and both vertebral arteries, close to their origin, and the left carotid in the neck. As water was injected, all the integuments of the neck, face, and head became distended, especially of the right side, and at length, in a very remarkable man- ner, much surpassing the greatest swelling I ever witnessed in the most severe cases of erysipelas, or of confluent small pox. The eye-lids, nose, lips, were protuberant and tense; the eyes closed; the mouth open, from expansion of the lips; the tongue enlarged and tense. Water exuded from the eyes, the nostrils and mouth; and, it would appear, from their surface generally. The experiment was dis- continued, when the water which flowed out from various parts seemed to be nearly equal in quantity to that which was injected. On examination no large vessel could be found ruptured. On removing G G 2

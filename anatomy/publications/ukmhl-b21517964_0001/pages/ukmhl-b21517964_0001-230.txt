210 TEMPERATURE OF THE SHEEP clothing of the animals, in conjunction with extreme dryness of air,*—the great activity of the function of digestion,f—the greater activity of the function of re- spiration, and the consequent greater degree of aeration of the blood: As our fires burn with more intensity in winter than in summer, and give off more heat, so in animals a greater degree of heat may be produced un- der the circumstances alluded to, when most required. With the hope of collecting some satisfactory in- formation on this point, I have selected the sheep, as a fit subject for trial, and I shall now record the re- sults which I obtained in winter, and spring, and summer. On the night of the 22nd January, 1838, the wind changed to the north, and the temperature fell below the freezing point. It continued so, constantly, to the 26th of the same month ; at night generally below 22°, and by day, at or below 29°. On the 26th, at noon, at Chatham, T made observations on * This is very strongly indicated by a circumstance which I heard related by Mr. King, the enterprising and very intelligent medical officer, who accompanied Captain Sir George Back,—how, in the depth of winter, the blankets exposed to the air after being frozen, dried so completely, that, when brought near a fire, not the slightest appearance of vapour was observ'able. I The journals of our arctic travellers offer very striking examples both of the accommodating power of the human stomach and the strength of digestion. The quantity of animal food consumed, when there is an ample supply, in the high northern regions, is marvellous. I have been informed by Dr. Richardson, that the daily allowance of meat to the servants of the Hudson’s Bay Company, is eight pounds a-man.—Their food is entirely animal food.

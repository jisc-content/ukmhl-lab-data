404 PROPORTION OF CALCAREOUS, ETC. portions of calcareous matter with certain diseased states and physical conditions according to precise rules. But on this head there is little encourage- ment to be sanguine at present: the limited ex- perience which we possess, does not point to any such rules. The subject is one of difficulty, and of little promise, and therefore not likely to be prose- cuted with the diligence and care requisite to dis- cover order; and which assuredly can only be effected by the simultaneous study of the patholo- gical state of the part, and its chemical composition, following it in its different stages. In application to particular questions, the results contained in this Table, I would hope, even limited as they are, may be of some use.

ITS SUPPOSED EFFECTS. 349 was found quite pervious, not in the least contracted. The w'ound in the fibro-cellular tissue or external coat was closed by a minute portion of dense coagu- lable lymph. But not so in the middle and inner coat; in these there was a gaping aperture, across which on minute inspection two fine threads appa- rently of coagulable lymph, as if the commencement of the healing process, were observable (vide Plate XIII, fig. 6). The cause of the dog’s death was not discovered. The other dog did not appear to suffer from the wound. The bandage and compresses were removed on the 15th February, without the occurrence of any bleeding. On the 20th of the same month, the wound in the neck was nearly closed by granulations. The artery was now cut down on, and the portion of it that had been wounded taken out between two ligatures previously applied. On careful examination of this excised part, it was found free from coagu- lable lymph—at least there was not the same thick- ening or tumour from lymph deposited as in the former case ; it was probably absorbed. When the external loose cellular tissue was dissected off, a very minute elevation, about the size of a pin’s head, appeared on the site of the wound, the remains of the cicatrix externally. The artery was completely pervious, and not at all contracted, where it had been wounded. Slit open for internal examination, the wound in the inner coat was marked by a red line interrupted by two white spots ; there was no gaping.

RISING FROM THE ARCH OF AORTA. 431 nominata was open; the right carotid and subcla- vian arteries also were open, but rather diminished in size. The left carotid, subclavian and vertebral arte- ries, as far as they were examined, namely to the ex- tent of about two inches, were impervious, plugged up with lymph. The intercostal arteries at their origin (they were not examined farther) were large. The state of the cerebral vessels, in consequence of the rapid manner in which the inspection was made, was not ascertained : the aneurismal tumor was pre- served, and through the kindness of the gentleman, who removed it, (Mr. Johnston,) I had an opportunity of examining it, and of satisfying myself respecting the most important points. In this instance, probably, the aneurism was of slow formation, and was latent, as so often happens in this malady, not only many months but even several years : the interesting part of the case, how- ever, is the obstruction of the great arteries, arising from the diseased portion, at their origin, and yet the supply of blood, not being cut off, clearly prov- ing, that new channels were established by anasto- moses, by which a quantity of arterial blood was transmitted to the head and upper limbs, not only sufficient to maintain life, but enough to maintain it with the vigour of ordinary health. At no time, after the obstruction of the great arteries was there any paralytic weakness of the hands, no numbness even of the fingers, and no decided diminution of temperature. The intellectual organ performed its

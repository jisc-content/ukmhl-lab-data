POISONOUS SNAKES OF CEYLON 131 system, tending to coagulate the former and convulse and paralyze the latter. All the experiments seem to point directly to this conclusion, not excepting even the third, the peculiarities of which may be referred to the reaction, which it may be conceived took place, the animal being pretty large and strong, and not overpowered by the immediate effect of the poison. From the whole of the preceding experiments, it may be inferred, reasoning from analogy, in relation to man, that the bite of the tic-polonga is most dangerous ; that of the hooded snake is dangerous in a less degree; and that of the carawilla, least of all, and probably never fatal. The result of the inquiries which I made amongst the natives, though not very satisfactory, tended to confirm these con- clusions : I found them generally of opinion, that the bite of the tic-polonga is unavoidably fatal, but that of the hooded snake only occasionally so. Per- haps they exaggerated a little in maintaining the first part of this statement: the latter part of it I believe to be quite correct; for I have seen several men who had recovered from the bite of the hooded snake, and I have heard of two or three only to whom it had proved fatal. I regret that I have nothing original to offer respecting the medical treatment of the bites of these snakes. It was my intention to have made a series of experiments on the subject; indeed, the experiments which I have detailed were merely pre- K 2

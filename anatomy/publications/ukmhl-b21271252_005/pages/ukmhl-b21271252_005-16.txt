THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. ENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. EDINBURGH T. C. k E. C. JACK; HEAD AND NECK. FRONT OF NECK—No. 2. THE INNER PART OF THE RIGHT CLAVICLE HAS BEEN REMOVED AND ALSO THE LOWER PART OF THE RIGHT STERNO-MASTOID MUSCLE, IN ORDER TO EXPOSE THE DEPRESSOR MUSCLES OF THE HYOID BONE, THE GREAT VESSELS AND THE LOWER PART OF THE POSTERIOR TRIANGLE. Muscles.—The depressor muscles of the hyoid are the sterno-hyoid, the omo-hyoid, and the sterno-thyroid and thyro-hyoid acting together. It should be noticed that the.sterno-hyoid lies in front of the greater part of the sterno-thyroid. The omo-hyoid is a valuable landmark both in the anterior and in the posterior triangles of the neck. The anterior belly crosses the structures which lie in the carotid sheath, while the posterior belly divides the posterior triangle into an upper and a lower portion, the latter being the subclavian triangle, in which the subclavian vessels and the upper part of the brachial plexus are situated. Vessels.—The internal jugular and the subclavian veins are shown. The former vessel overlaps the common carotid artery in the lower part of its course and is covered by the sterno-mastoid muscle. A number of enlarged lymphatic glands are seen lying along the superficial and outer wad of this vessel in its upper part. The subclavian vein arches over the first rib, lying in front of the corresponding artery, from which it is separated by the scalenus anticus muscle, and also lies at a lower level. It receives the suprascapular and transversalis colli veins, and the anterior and the external jugular veins. Just before its termination it was crossed by a large lympatic vessel, which has been preserved. The relations of the subclavian artery, vein, and the brachial plexus nerve-trunks to one another should be noticed. Bone: Muscle 1. Hyoid. 2. 8ternuin. 3. First rib. 4. Sterno-hyoid. 5.

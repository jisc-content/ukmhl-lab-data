THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. HEAD AND NECK. PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGION.—No. 2. THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE LOWER JAW SHOWN IN THE FORMER VIEW HAS BEEN REMOVED, AND THE INTERNAL PTERYGOID MUSCLE HAS BEEN CUT SHORT. Under the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth lie the following structures :— The sublingual gland, with the lingual nerve and the terminal part of Wharton's duct upon its deep aspect. The lingual nerve runs for some distance subjacent to the mucous membrane, and gives oft' branches to the submaxillary ganglion, which is seen to lie between the lingual nerve and the deep portion of the sub- maxillary gland. '1 hence the nerve passes onwards to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. At a lower level lie the genioglossus muscle and the hypoglossal nerve, which is accompanied by the ranine vein. These structures in turn are supported by the mylohyoid muscle and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. Further back, the styloglossus muscle is seen descending to the side of the tongue, and the external carotid and the facial arteries are seen to pass between this muscle on the one side, and the stylohyoid and posterior belly of the digastric on the other. The figures indicate— Muscles. 13. Internal maxillary artery. 1. External pterygoid. 14. External carotid and superior thyroid arteries. 2. Internal pterygoid. 15. Facial artery and ascending palatine branch. 3. Buccinator, with the long buccal nerve and Stenson's 16. Hypoglossal nerve. duct. 17. Mucous mcmbiane and sublingual gland. 4. Posterior belly of the digastric. 18. Wharton's duct. 5. Stylohyoid. 19. Inferior dental nerve, divided, and its mylohyoid 6. Anterior belly of the digastric. branch. 7. Mylohyoid. 20. Nerve to thyrohyoid muscle from hypoglossal. 8. Geniohyoid. 21. Long buccal nerve. 9. Sternomastoid. 22. Facial nerve. 10. Styloglossus. 23. Spinal accessory nerve and sternomastoid artery. Other structures. 24. Lingual nerve above the submaxillary ganglion. 11. External carotid artery. 25. Hyoglossus muscle, crossed by Wharton's duct. 12. Auriculo-temporal nerve and superficial temporal artery.

THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E, C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDONJSLCL HEAD AND NECK. LARYNX—No. 3. TWO SPECIMENS, VIEWED FROM BEHIND. IN A, THE INTER ARYTENOID FOLD AND ADJACENT PARTS OF THE ARYTENOID CARTILAGES HAVE BEEN REMOVED. B IS THE ANTERIOR HALF OF A CORONAL SECTION THROUGH THE LARYNX AND ADJACENT PARTS. Tlie cavity of the larynx is divided into three portions, of which the upper extends from the superior aperture down to the level of the false vocal cords, and is called the vestibule. Its wall is formed by the mucous membrane covering the back of the epiglottis and the thyro-epiglottic ligament in front, the inner aspect of the aryteno-epiglottic fold at the side, and the arytenoid cartilages and the interarytenoid fold at the-back. The false vocal cords are two prominent rounded folds which extend along the side wall above the level of the true vocal cords. The free border which projects inwards is thick and rounded, and is of a pink colour during life. The interval between the false cords is called the false glottis. Below the false cords on each side is a recess called the ventricle of the larnyx. This recess passes upwards and outwards under the false cord, and is continued upwards into the saccule (see No. 2). The true vocal cords arc two folds which project into the cavity on each side. They arc attached in front to the back of the thyroid cartilage in the angle between the ala?, while, behind, they are attached t'> the anterior or vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages. The edges of these cords arc thin and sharp, and the cords are of a pearly white colour. The interval between them is called the glottis or rima glottidis. Below the level of the true vocal cords is the lowest portion of the cavity of the larnyx, which gradually widens out and communicates with the cavity of the trachea.

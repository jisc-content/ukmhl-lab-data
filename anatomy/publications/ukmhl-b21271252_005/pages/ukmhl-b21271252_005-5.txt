THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. HEAD AND NECK. PAROTID REGION—No. 2. THE PAKOTID GLAND HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BED IN WHICH IT LAY, IN ORDER TO SHOW ITS DEEP RELATIONS. The fossa for the parotid gland extends upwards to the zygoma, behind it is limited by the sterno-mastoid muscle, the mastoid process, and the external auditory meatus. In front, the gland is bent round the ascending ramus and the neck of the mandible, and lies upon both their superficial and deep aspects. The fossa passes deeply inwards towards the base of the skull, and is related above to the posterior part of the glenoid cavity, while below and behind it is bounded by the digastric muscle, and it passes inwards to the styloid process and the styloid muscles. The external carotid artery is seen passing through the gland and dividing into the internal maxillary and temporal branches, while the facial nerve enters the gland and forms a plexus within its substance, and the auriculo-temporal nerve appears above its upper and posterior border. The spinal accessory nerve is seen in a position in which it is readily accessible, as it passes from under cover of the digastric muscle to the sterno-mastoid, lying upon the transverse process of the atlas vertebra, and accompanied by the sterno-mastoid branch of the occipital artery. The figures iadicate- 1. Zygoma. 2. Condyle of mandible. 3. Deep head of masseter muscle. 4. Superficial head of masseter muscle. 5. Sterno-mastoid muscle. 6. Digastric muscle. 7. Common facial vein. 8. Internal jugular vein. 9. Spinal accessory nerve and accompanying artery. 10. Posterior auricular branch of facial nerve. 11. Facial nerve. 12. External carotid artery. 13. Superficial temporal artery and auriculotemporal nerve. 14. Facial vein. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C.

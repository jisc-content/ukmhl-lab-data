THE CAVITY OF THE PHARYNX HAS BEEN EXPOSED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE POSTERIOR WALL. ON THE RIGHT SIDE THE LATERAL RELATIONS ARE EXPOSED. The cavity of the pharynx extends from the base of the skull down to the level of the sixth cervical vertebra. It is situated behind the nose, mouth, and larynx, and is correspondingly divided into three parts called the naso-pharynx, the oral pharynx, and the laryngeal pharynx, respectively. The naso- pharynx communicates with the nasal cavity by the posterior nares, and the Eustachian tubes also open into it (see later). The oral pharynx communicates with the cavity of the mouth by an aperture which is bounded above by the soft palate, below by the dorsum of the tongue, and laterally by the anterior pillars of the fauces, which in this specimen are concealed from view by the prominent tonsil on either side. The laryngeal pharynx lies at a still lower level than the former, and in its anterior wall is the opening of the larynx, bounded by the epiglottic cartilage in front, by the aryteno-epiglottic folds laterally, and by the arytenoid cartilages and the inter-arytenoid fold at the back. On each side of the laryngeal opening is the pyriform sinus, a recess which passes outwards and forwards in the interval between the aryteno-epiglottic fold and the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and in which foreign bodies are very liable to be lodged. The lateral relations of the pharynx are more clearly seen in the next view. The figun 1. Basis cranii. 2. Soft palate. 3. Eustachian cushion. 4. Dorsum of tongue. 5. Epiglottis. 6.

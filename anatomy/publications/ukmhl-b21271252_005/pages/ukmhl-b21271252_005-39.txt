The parts of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes covering the insula of the left hemisphere have been removed by a cone-like section. The insula, or island of Reil, is a portion of the cortex concealed from view in the adult brain by the growth over it of the adjacent portions of the cortex. These portions are termed the opercula, and belong to the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. The insula is surrounded by a slit-like groove, the sulcus limitans insulae, which marks off the surface of the insula from the cortex, and which entirely surrounds it except at the lower and front part, where the insula is continuous with the back part of the orbital surface of the frontal lobe. Like the rest of the cortex, the insula is divided by fissures into convolutions. The principal fissure runs obliquely downwards and forwards, and is called the sulcus centralis insulae. It runs very much in the same direction as the fissure of Rolando, and divides the insula into an anterior and a posterior part. The posterior part shows one or more convolutions called gyri longi insulae, while the anterior part is subdivided by radiating fissures into several gyri breves insulae. The upper part of the insula overlies the claustrum and the external capsule of the basal ganglia. The figures indicate:— 1. Fissure of Eolando. 2. Temporal pole. 3. Sulcus limitans insulse. 4. Sulcus centralis insulse. 5. Gyri longi insulse. 6. Gyri breves insulse.

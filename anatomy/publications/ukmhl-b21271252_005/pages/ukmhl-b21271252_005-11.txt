THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH; T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. HEAD AND NECK. SAGITTAL SECTION OF THE HEAD—No. I. THE SECTION IS SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE MESIAL PLANE IN FRONT, AND HAS LEFT THE SEPTUM OF THE NOSE, BUT AT THE BACK IT IS SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF THE MESIAL PLANE. The disc of cartilage between the sphenoid and the occipital bone is seen, as the subject was young, and it can also be noticed that the odontoid process of the axis vertebra is tipped with cartilage. Several of the large subarachnoid spaces at the base of the brain are seen {vide Spinal Canal, No. 2), the cisterna basalis a large cavity in front of the pons Varolii, the cisterna pontis, which is the continuation upwards of the anterior part of the subarachnoid space of the spinal canal, and the cisterna magna, between the under surface of the cerebellum and the back of the medulla. Where the section passes through the larynx, the true vocal cord is seen, with the laryngeal recess immediately above it, and the false vocal cord immediately above that again. In the child the larynx is at a higher level than in the adult, so that the cricoid cartilage lies at the level of the fifth cervical vertebra, while in the adult it is usually at the sixth. The adenoid tissue in the pharyngeal wall in front of the basi-occipital bone is somewhat hyper- trophied in this specimen, forming the well known condition of adenoid vegetations. These vegetations spread outwards on each side to the region of the lateral recess of the pharynx. The hyoid bone can be seen in section just in front of the figure 15. The interval between it and the symphysis menti corresponds to the floor of the mouth. 1. Nasal septum. 2. Basi-sphenoid. 3. Basi-occipital. 4. Atlas, anterior arch. 5. Axis. 6.

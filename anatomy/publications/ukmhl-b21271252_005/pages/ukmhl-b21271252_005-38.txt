THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK ; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. CRANIOCEREBRAL TOPOGRAPHY—No, 10. THE PARTS SEEN IN THE FORMER VIEW ARE SHOWN IN RELATION TO THE SURFACE LINES ON THE SCALP. Sylvian fissure. The point A lies at a higher level than the division of the Sylvian fissure, and the line AC also lies at a rather higher level than the posterior horizontal limb. This is one of the instances in which, as previously noticed, the fissure may lie at a lower level than the pterion, the opposite of the condition in the brain of the child. Motor area. The motor area lies inside the quadrilateral AGDM, the line MA following the line of the precentral sulcus in its upper and lower portions. The lower part of the line CD lies a little behind the lower part of the postcentral sulcus, and the upper part of that line corresponds to the upper part of the sulcus. The triangle TRO corresponds to the outer surface of the occipital lobe, and the point R lies a little above the attachment of the tentorium cerebelli and the highest part of the lateral sinus. The point B overlies the angular gyrus or word-seeing area. The pentagonal figure BRPNA includes the whole of the outer surface of the temporal lobe, in which lies the parallel fissure (7) a finger's-breadth below the posterior limb of the Sylvian fissure. Taste and smell are localised to the anterior end of the temporal lobe. The figures indicate— 1. Division of the Sylvian fissure. 5. Precentral sulcus, lower part. 2. Lower end of the fissure of Rolando. 6. Postcentral sulcus, lower part. 3. Arm centre. 7. Parallel fissure. 4. Supramarginal convolution. The letters indicate the points as previously determined upon the surface of the scalp by Chiene's method (See No. 1.).

THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH; T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 3-t HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. HEAD AND NECK. fRONT OF NECKâ€”No. 4. THIS VIEW SHOWS A DEEP DISSECTION OF THE ROOT OF THE NECK, THE UPPER PART OF THE STERNUM AND THE INNER ENDS OF THE FIRST COSTAL ARCHES HAVING BEEN REMOVED ON BOTH SIDES. As the trachea descends it recedes from the surface and is crossed by the left innominate vein, while lower down the innominate artery also lies in front of it. The common carotid arteries lie on either side, and further back also the recurrent laryngeal nerves, of which the left one is seen. The course of the phrenic nerves is seen as they pass forwards, and the nerve of the left side is seen to be crossed by the internal mammary artery, although it is more usual for the nerve to cross in front of the artery. The thyroid gland in this specimen has a large pyramidal lobe which passes upwards from the right lobe as far as to the hyoid bore. The distance to which the pleural membranes pass into the neck is seen. On both sides the membrane extends for a distance of about an inch above the anterior end of the first rib, behind the scalenus anticus muscle. The figures indicate- 1. Trachea. 2. Clavicle (divided). 3. First rib (divided). 4. Sterno-mastoid muscle. 5. Pyramidal lobe of thyroid gland. 6. Thyro-hyoid muscle. 7. Sterno-thyroid muscle. 8. Sterno-mastoid muscle. 9. Omo-hyoid muscle. 10. Scalenus anticus muscle. 11. Scalenus medius (margin of). 12. Left innominate vein. 13. Eight innominate vein. 14. Innominate artery. 15. Common carotid arteries. 16. Subclavian arteries. 17. Internal mammary artery. 18. Left recurrent laryngeal nerve. 19. Vagus nerves. 20. Brachial plexus. 21. Pleural membrane. 22. Isthmus of thyroid.

THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. JACK; and 3i HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. HEAD AND NECK. PTEEYGO-MAXILLARY REGION—No. 1. THE ZYGOMATIC ARCH HAS BEEN REMOVED, WITH THE MASSETER MUSCLE, AND ALSO THE CORONOID PROCESS OF THE LOWER JAW AND THE LOWER PART OP THE TEMPORAL MUSCLE. THE UPPER HALF OF THE ASCENDING RAMUS OF THE JAW HAS ALSO BEEN REMOVED, AND THE EXTERNAL PTERYGOID MUSCLE AND THE PARTS ADJACENT TO IT ARE EXPOSED. The external pterygoid muscle arises by two heads, from the zygomatic surface of the great wing of the sphenoid, and from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate respectively. The muscle passes nearly horizontally backwards to be inserted into the neck of the mandible and the front of the meniscus of the temporo-mandibular articulation. The lingual and the inferior dental nerves appear at the lower border, the long buccal nerve comes out between the two heads of origin, and the temporal and masseteric nerves emerge above the upper border, while the auriculo-temporal nerve winds round behind the condylar process. The muscle is therefore a very useful landmark for all these branches of the inferior maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. The internal maxillary artery, which is the larger of the two terminal branches of the external carotid, passes forwards between the neck of the mandible and the internal lateral ligament, and then passes either on the superficial or, as here, upon the deep surface of the external pterygoid muscle. The posterior dental artery, seen in the anterior part of the space, is a branch which arises from the third part of the internal maxillary artery in the spheno-maxillary fossa. It runs upon the posterior aspect of the maxilla, supplying branches to the upper molar and bicuspid teeth. Muscles :— 1. Temporal. 2. Sterno-mastoid. 3. Posterior belly of the digastric. 4.

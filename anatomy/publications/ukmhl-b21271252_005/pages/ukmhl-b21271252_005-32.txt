THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. CRANIO CEREBRAL TOPOGRAPHY—No. 4. A COMBINED VIEW HAS BEEN TAKEN TO SHOW THE RELATION OF THE SURFACE MARKINGS, THE SUTURES, AND THE BLOOD VESSELS OF THE MENINGES TO ONE ANOTHER. 1. Sutures. The point A on the surface overlies the pterion, or, as in the child, may lie rather above it, and the same point overlies the anterior division of the middle meningeal artery. The line MN lies entirely behind the coronal suture but is nearly parallel to it. The posterior division of the middle meningeal artery crosses the squamous suture at a uoint above the external auditory meatus. The point T overlies the lambda, and the line TR corresponds witn considerable accuracy to the lambdoidal suture. The point B corresponds to the position of the parietal eminence. The letters indicate the same points as in No. 1, viz. — M. Midpoint between glabella and external 1). External angular process. occipital protuberance. P. Preauricular point. T Three-quarter point between glabella and ex- N. Midpoint between E and P. ternal occipital protuberance. A. Intersection of MN and TE. S. Seven-eighths point between glabella and ex- C. Midpoint of AB. ternal occipital protuberance. R. Midpoint of PS. O. External occipital protuberance. P. Intersection of MR and TE. G. Glabella. L. Lateral sinus.

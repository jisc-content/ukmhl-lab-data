THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and U HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.O, CRANIO CEREBRAL TOPOGRAPHY—No. 9. THE GREATER PART OF THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE LEFT CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE OF AN ADULT MALE HAS BEEN EXPOSED IN SITU, AND SOME OF THE IMPORTANT FISSURES ARE MARKED. This view should be compared with that of the brain of a child, and the notes made in relation to it on the localisation of function should be referred to. Individual variations exist in the surface anatomy of the cerebral hemispheres, but it will be seen that in the present instance the fissure of Rolando pursues a very characteristic course, and that the arm-centre is well developed and causes a marked deflection in the course of the fissure The upturned end of the posterior horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius is bounded by a Avell- marked gyrus, the supramarginal. The first temporal, or parallel fissure, is not continuous, but is intersected by bridging convolutions which subdivide it into small parts. There is, however, an upturned end similar to that of the fissure of Sylvius, which cuts into the parietal lobe and is bounded by the angular gyrus. The localisation of these parts to the surface lines is shown in the next view. The figures indicate— 1. Division of the Sylvian fissure. 2. Lower end of the fissure of Eolando. 3. Arm-centre deflecting the fissure of Eolando backwards. 4. Supramarginal convolution. 5. Lower part of the precentral sulcus. 6. Postcentral sulcus (vertical part of the intraparietal sulcus). 7. Parallel sulcus.

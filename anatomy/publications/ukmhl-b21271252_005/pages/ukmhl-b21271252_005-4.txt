THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. HEAD AND NECK. PAROTID REGIONâ€”No. 1. A SUPERFICIAL DISSECTION HAS BEEN MADE OF THE PAROTID GLAND AND THE STRUCTURES RELATED TO IT, AND OF THE SIDE OF THE FACE AND THE UFPER PART OF THE NECK. The parotid gland contains some lymphatic glands which lie embedded in its substance. One of these is seen lying superficially. Emerging from the anterior part of the gland are the transverse facial artery, the duct of the parotid, and the branches of the facial nerve. In front of the anterior border of the masseter muscle is a small triangular space branched above by the zygomaticus major, and below by the risorius muscle, while the floor is formed by the buccinator. In this space are found the facial vessels and some of their branches, the long buccal nerve and the buccal artery, and the terminal portion of the duct of the parotid. The figures indicate- 1.

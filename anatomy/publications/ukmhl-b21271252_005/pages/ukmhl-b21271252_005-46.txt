THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. BRAIN.—No. 22. DISSECTION OF THE CEREBRUM FROM BELOW TO SHOW THE ROOF AND OUTER WALL OF THE DESCENDING AND POSTERIOR HORNS OF THE LATERAL VENTRICLE ON THE RIGHT SIDE, AND THE WHITE MATTER OF THE FLOORS OF THESE HORNS ON THE LEFT SIDE. The mid-brain has been cut through transversely and the cerebellum, etc., removed. On the left side the grey matter of the lower surfaces of the occipital and temporal lobes and of the hippo- campal gyrus has been removed. On the right side the whole floor has been removed, and the ependyma covering the tamia semicircularis and the tail of the caudate nucleus has been scraped away. The figures indicate- 4. Posterior end of cingulum (on the right side it is cut). White matter of the floor of the posterior horn derived from the splehium. White matter of the floor of the descending horn. The figure is placed on fibres of the cingulum. Between the figures 3 and 13 are fibres from the splenium also forming part of the floor. Amygdaloid tubercle—an eminence in the anterior part of the roof of the descending horn, pro- duced by the superjacent amygdaloid nucleus. 5. Tail of caudate nucleus. 6. Taenia semicircularis.—A band of fibres arising mainly in the amygdaloid nucleus, whence it runs backwards in the roof of the descending horn, arches upwards into the body of the lateral ventricle, where it runs forwards between the optic thalamus and caudate nucleus to the foramen of Monro. From here it descends to the anterior perforated spot. 7. Forceps major. It is formed of fibres of the . splenium which sweep backwards into the occi- pital lobe by the inner side of the posterior horn. 8. Splenium of the corpus callosum. The dark object above the figure is the pineal body. 9. Supra-callosal gyrus. 10. Calcarine fissure. 11. Outer wall and roof of posterior horn. 12. Outer wall and roof of descending horn. The outer walls and roofs of these horns are formed by the tapetum—a thin layer composed of fibres derived from the corpus callosum, which lies next the ependyma. 13. Inferior longitudinal fasciculus. 14. Pulvinar of optic thalamus. 15. Internal geniculate body. 16. External geniculate body. 17. The uncus. 18. Corpus quadrigeminum superius. 19. Crusta of the mid-brain. 20. White core of the quadrate lobule.

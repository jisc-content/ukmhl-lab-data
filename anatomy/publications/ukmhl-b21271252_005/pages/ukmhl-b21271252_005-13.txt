THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH; T. C. & E. 0. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. HEAD AND NECK, NOSE AND PHARYNX—No 2. A SECTION SIMILAR TO THE FORMER, AFTER REMOVAL OF THE TURBINATED BONES. Nose. The inferior meatus of the nose lies between the floor and the inferior turbinated bone. It is almost horizontal in direction, and it receives at its anterior and upper part the nasal duct, leading from the lachrymal sac. This meatus is the principal respiratory channel. The middle meatus extends between the middle and the inferior turbinated bones. The upper and anterior part of this meatus is curved upwards, and forms a funnel-shaped channel into which the frontal sinus opens at the upper part. It is termed the infundibulum, and it is limited behind by a deep curved groove called the hiatus semilunaris, into which the anterior ethmoidal cells and the antrum of Highmore open. Above the hiatus is a convex prominent area termed the bulla ethmoidalis, and above this bulla is the opening of the middle ethmoidal air-cells. Below the hiatus semilunaris there is here an additional orifice which is occasionally present, leading to the antrum of Highmore. The superior meatus is a small channel lying above the middle turbinated bone, and into it the posterior ethmoidal and the sphenoidal air-cells open. 1, 2, and 3. Corresponding cervical vertebrae. 4.

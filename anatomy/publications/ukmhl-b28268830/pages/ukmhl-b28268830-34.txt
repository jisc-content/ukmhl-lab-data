( 28 ) remarkable Croton Oil seeds which prove so efficacious a purgative for the Elephant in ounce doses, have, when to the extent of an ounce, morning and evening, pro- duced no apparent or other visible effect. Thinking that a much smaller dose of this medicine than what is required to move the Elephant would be efficacious in the Camel. I commenced with a drachm of it—no effect—two drachms were given in the morning of the following day—then at 11 a. m. and 4 p. m, on each occasions a drachm. On the 3rd day a drachm, morning and evening, were given. On the 4th day half an ounce morning and evening, but without any apparent effect. An ounce, or at most an ounce and a half of the pulverized seeds, will freely purge the Elephant within the 24 hours. Common Salt also appears inert as a purgative to the Camel. I have given it in doses to the extent of a pound. Enemata do not appear to act on the bowels of the Camel—one consisting amongst others of a gallon and a half of water, a pound of common Salt and a pint of Castor Oil had no effect. TONICS. The Margoosa Bark and Milky-juice of the Madaar, are given with advantage for this purpose, in Mussals, for which Native recipes are given below. SUBJOINED ARE NATIVE RECEIPTS, See. Sec.

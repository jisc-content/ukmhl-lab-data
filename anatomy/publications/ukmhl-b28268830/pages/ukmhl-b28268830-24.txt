( 18 ) Treatment.—Native treatment consists in applying stimulating embrocations or liniments with the view to expedite suppuration. The same treatment is to be observed for this affection as for Eakud. Part 3d page 48. RUSSOOLEE. History.—This is a tumour about two inches diameter situate below skin, and consists of a cyst containing caseous or cheese-like matter. It has no particular site, as it may occur in any part of surface. It invariably goes on to ulceration, when the matter of the cyst escapes, and this latter sloughs out. It occurs during all seasons, and animals of all ages and variety of condition are attacked equally by it. It is not of frequent occurrence, and does not throw the animal out of work. Treatment—No native treatment is practised. A purgative preceded by an Alterative ball of Calomel and Sulphuret of Antimony ought to be given. Part 3d page 25. BALE. History.—This is very troublesome and acrid tumour of a suppurative kind which may appear in any part of the body, and in several numbers at a time ; they usually attain to a size of two inches in diameter. When situate on the body they are called Nurbale; when on the legs Maadee-bale; but there is no difference beyond site. The tumour whether on body or limbs being of the same nature. After one set of tumours have appeared suppurated and nearly healed, another set appear, and go through the same stage, to be succeeded by successive sets which eventually render the animal unfit for further service. It is an obstinate disease, and fortunately is one of rare occurrence. Treatment.—Alterative doses of Calomel and Sulphuret of Antimony ought to be given with occasional purges. Part 3d page 25. JHOLLUKA-GUDDAY; OR AGEEN BHAO. History.—This is a suppurative eruption which breaks out over different parts of body, and usually is the result of over-exposure to an ardent sun. The eruption commences in vesicle and terminates by suppuration.

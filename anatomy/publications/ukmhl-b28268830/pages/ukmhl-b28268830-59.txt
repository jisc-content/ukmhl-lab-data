PART FOURTH A GENERAL VIEW OF THE ANATOMY OF THE CAMEL. As the Camel differs little in its general organization from the Horse, and as only so much of its Anatomy is intended here to be given as will meet the practical object of a guide in the treatment of diseases of its organs, little under this head need be advanced. Indeed, the osseous system or Skeleton, and the Sanguiferous, appear to be all that it is practically useful to allude to. The former, as affording land-marks of the relative position of organs—the latter in reference to the operation of bleeding. OF THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. Table 1st is a sketch of the Skeleton of a Camel fitted up at Hoonsoor under my superintendence, with the view to convey some idea of the structure of the animal to the Serwans. A. The cranium and upper and lower jaws. In the upper jaw there are no front incisor teeth. There are two canine teeth and five grinders on each side. In the under jaw there are six front or incisor teeth—two canine on either side and five grinders. B. The bones or vertebrae of the neck, of which there are seven. C. Vertebrae of trunk and loins, of which there are nineteen. D. Ribs, of which there are twelve on each side. E. The shoulder blade. F. The Humerus, or arm bone. G. The bone of the fore-arm. II. The bones of the carpus or wrist of which there are seven in each fore-limb. I. The metatarsus or carpal bones. J. The phalanges, of which there are six arranged in the two parallel views. At K. are four semilunar shaped bones. L. The rump-bone, terminated by M. the bones of the tail. N. The haunch bones, or side bones of the pelvis. O. The thigh bone. P. The tibia or bone of the leg. Q. The bones of the tarsus, of which there are as in the fore limb seven. O

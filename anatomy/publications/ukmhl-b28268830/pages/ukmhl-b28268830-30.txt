The Camel, like the Elephant, doubtless suffers from continued exposure to an ardent Sun; which therefore, as far as is practicable, should be avoided. The Epileptic affection described at page 7 of this Memoir, I have reason to think arises from exposure; and I have been informed that Tippoo defended his Camels from the Sun by sheds. The Breeders of the Camel are attentive to this point, securing their shelter by topes. It therefore becomes a question how far it is advisable to preserve the head of the animal when employed during hot weather by a wadded piece of cloth. DIET.

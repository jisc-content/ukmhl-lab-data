Paet L] of the bones. 57 In a Foetus, the Ethmoid Bone is divided into two by a Cartilaginous Partition, which afterwards forms the Nasal Plate and Crista Galli. The other parts of the Bone are completely ossified. Os Sphenoides. Here attend to, The situation of the Sphenoid, Cuneiform, or wedge- shaped Bone, in the middle of the Cranium. Its irregular Figure, which has been compared to that of a Bat with extended wings. The Temporal Plates, or Wings, placed at the sides of the Bone, and each hollow at the upper and outer part, for lodging a share of the Temporal Muscle; and also at the under and outer part, where the Pterygoi- deus Externus has some of its origin. The Orhitar Plates, at the fore part of the Temporal Wings, forming a portion of the outside of the Orbits. The upper and fore part of the Temporal Plates, forming irregular Surfaces, where they are connected to the under and lateral portions of the Frontal Bone. The Spinous Process, at the under and back part of each Temporal Plate. A Styloid Process, frequently observed at the point of the Spinous, from both of which the Circumflexus Palati arises. Between the Temporal and Spinous Processes, a ragged Arch for receiving the fore part of the Squa- mous Plate of the Temporal Bone. The two Pterygoid, or Aliform Processes, placed al- most perpendicularly to the Body of the Bone, These

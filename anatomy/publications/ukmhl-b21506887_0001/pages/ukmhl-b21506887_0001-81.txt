61 Part I.] OF THE BONES. and are partly formed there by the Os Frontis; hence, they may be ranked among the common Holes of the Cranium. The Foramina Rotunda^ a little behind the Fora> mina Lacera, for the passage of the second part of the Fifth Pair of Nerves, which are termed the Superior Maxillary. From the outer end of each Foramen Rotundum, a small Groove frequently extends outwards between the Ridge separating the Orbitar from the Temporal Pro^ cess, and points out the course of a Branch of the Su- perior Maxillary Nerve to the Temporal Muscle. The Foramina Ovalia, considerably larger than the Foramina Rotunda, and placed farther back, and mord externally, for the passage of the third part of the Fifth Pair of Nerves, and commonly for the passage of the Veins also, which accompany the principal Ar- teries of the Dura Mater. The Foramina Spinalia, a little to the outer and back part of the Foramina Ovalia, and in the points of the Spinous Processes, for the transmission of the middle and principal Trunks of the Arteries of the Dura Mater, the impressions of which are so conspi- cuous on the inner side of the Temporal Bones. The Foramina Pterygoidea, vel Foramina Pterygo-* palatina, termed also, from the discoverer. Foramina ViDiANA, at the roots of the inner Plates of the Ptery- goid Processes, for the passage of two recurrent or re- flected Branches of the second part of the Fifth Pair of Nerves: The Foramina Pterygoidea are the smallest of the Sphenoid Holes, and cannot be distinctly seen in an

88 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. tebrae, for fixing them together, and allowing the Spine to be moved in all directions. The Intervertebral Substances^ composed of Concen- tric Lamellce, with their edges firmly fixed to the Bo- dies of the Vertebrae. The Lamellae of these Substances, formed of Ob- lique Fibres, which decussate each other, and are very compressible. The Centre of these Substances changes from La- mellcB^ and puts on the appearance of a Mucus or Pulp, which has little compressibility, and serves as a. pivot, upon which the other parts of the Substance can move with such gradual yielding, as to lessen shocks in the Spine, in violent motions of the Body. The Intervertebral Substances, like the Vertebrae themselves, larger and thicker as they descend, to give more security to the parts they support. An Arch sent out from the back part of the Body of each Vertebra, which, together with the Body, forms a large Hole; and the different Holes being placed over each other, a Canal is formed for lodging the Spinal Marrow. A Notch at the upper and under edges of each side of the Arch, forming, in the contiguous Vertebrae, the passages of the Spinal Nerves. The Processes of each Vertebra, seven in number; viz. two Superior Oblique, two Inferior Oblique, two Transverse, and one Spinous. The two Superior Oblique, or Articulating Processes, covered with Cartilage, placed upon the upper part of the sides of the Arch. The two Inferior Oblique or Articulating Processes,

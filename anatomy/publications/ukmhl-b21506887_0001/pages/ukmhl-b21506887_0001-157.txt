Part I ] OF THE BONES. 135 a straight line with the Upper Arm ; but little or no rotation* It gives origin to the Pronator Radii Quadratus, and Indicator ;—to part of the Extensores Ossis Me- tacarpi, Primi Internodii et Secundi Internodii Polli- cis, Flexores Carpi Radialis et Ulnaris, Flexores Di- gitorum Sublimis et Profundus, Supinator Radii Bre- vis, Pronator Radii Teres, and Extensor Carpi Ulna- ris.—Insertion to the Brachialis Internus, .Triceps Extensor Cubiti, and Anconeus. Radius. The Radius shorter than the Ulna by the length of the Olecranon. The Situation of the Radius at the outer part of the Fore-arm. The upper end of the Radius, covered with Cartilage, and formed into a circular Head, which is hollowed above, for receiving the outer part of the Articular Surface of the Os Humeri. The inner side of the Head smooth, and also cover- ed with Cartilage, where it plays in the small Semilu- nar Cavity at the outer side of the Ulna. The Cervix of the Radius smaller than the Head; in the Subject surrounded by a circular Ligament, which keeps the Bone in its place, and allows it to roll upon the Ulna. The Tubercle of the Radius, at the under and in- ner part of the Cervix, for the insertion of the Biceps Flexor Cubiti. The Body of the Bone larger than that of the Ulna,

27 Part I.J OF THE BONES, OF THE HEAD OR SKULL IN GENERAL. By the Head is meant all that part of the Skeleton which is placed above the first Bone of the Neck. It therefore comprehends the Cranium and Bones of the Face. The Cranium, or Brain-case, varies in shape in dif- ferent persons, according to the original form of the Brain upon which it is moulded. The variety in shape exists not only in different persons, but in the opposite sides of the same Skull, scarcely any one being found perfectly similar there, when minutely examined. The variety of shape has been supposed by some Authors to be increased by the different management of the Heads of Children at an early period of life. From this the difference of shape observed in the Skulls of people of different nations has been accounted for. The form, however, does not appear to be much affected by the management of the Head at an early period of infancy, since its characte- ristic marks are found to remain nearly the same, how- ever much the customs in dress and general manage- ment may vary. The Cranium forms a vaulted Cavity for lodging and defending the Brain, with its Membranes, Vessels, and Nerves.

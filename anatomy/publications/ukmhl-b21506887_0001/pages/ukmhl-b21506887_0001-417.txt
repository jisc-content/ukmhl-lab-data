Part III ] OF THE LIGAMENTS. S57 the Os Femoris, and fixed to the Fibula, a little below its Head. Behind the long external Lateral Ligament, there is an Eocpansmn attached nearl}^ in the same manner as this Ligament, which has been termed the External Short Lateral Ligament. These Ligaments prevent the lateral and rotatory motions of the Leg in the extended state, but admit of a small degree of both when the Limb is bent. The Posterior Ligament of Winslow, formed of ir- regular Bands, which arise from the upper and back part of the external Condyle of the Os Femoris, and descend obliquely over the Capsular Ligament, to be fixed to the Tibia under the inner and back part of its Head. It prevents the Leg from being pulled farther forwards than to a straight line with .the Thigh, and also furnishes a convenient situation for the beginnings of the Gastrocnemius and Plantaris Muscles. When this Ligament is wanting, which is some- times the case, its place is supplied by a Membranous Expansion. The Ligament of the Patella., which arises from a Depression behind the Apex of that Bone, and is fixed to the Tuberosity of the upper and fore part of the Tibia. By the intervention of this Ligament, the Muscles inserted into the Patella are enabled to extend the Leg. The Capsular Ligament^ which arises from the whole circumference of the under end of the Thigh-bone, some way above the Margin of the Articulating Carti- lage, and above the posterior part of the great Notch between tlie Condyles. From this it descends to be

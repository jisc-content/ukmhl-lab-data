160 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The circumference of the Articular Surface, marJced by a rough Line, into which the Capsular Ligament of the Joint is fixed. The Base, or upper part of the Bone, horizontal^ and marked by the insertion of the Tendons of the ' Extensors of the Leg. The back part of the Apex rough and depressed, for the attachment of the Ligament which passes from the Patella to the Tubercle of the Tibia. The Patella has a thin, though firm external Table. Its internal substance is Cellular, but the Cells are small, and have so much Osseous Matter employed in their formation, as to give the Bone a considerable de- gree of strength. The structure of this Bone, the toughness of the Ligaments which cover it, and the free motion it is allowed, are found to enable it better to resist any common force applied to it, than if it had been a pro- cess continued from the Tibia, as the Olecranon is from the Ulna. The Ligaments of the Patella allow it to be moved upwards and downwards; and when the Leg is ex- tended, they admit of its motion to either side, or to be rolled. When the Leg is extended, the Patella is lodged in the Trochlea of the Os Femoris; when the Limb is bent, the Patella is pulled down by the Tibia, and lodged in a hollow at the fore part of the Knee. The Patella defends the fore part of the Knee, in- creases the Anale of insertion of the Muscles fixed to o it, and serves as a pulley or lever, by enabling the Mus- cles to act with greater advantage in extending the Leg.

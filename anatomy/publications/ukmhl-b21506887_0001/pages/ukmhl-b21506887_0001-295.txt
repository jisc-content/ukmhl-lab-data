Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. 235 from near its Head, extending outwards as far as the Coracoid Process of the Scapula. Jetton: To pull the Clavicle, and with it the Sca- pula, downwards and forwards. Serratus Magnus, Vel Serratus Major Anticus^ vel Costo-scapularis, Origin: From the nine superior Ribs, by an equal number of Fleshy Digitations. It runs obliquely up- wards and backwards upon the side of the Thorax, and between it and the Subscapulars. Insertion : Fleshy, into the whole length of the Base of the Scapula, and in a manner folded round it, be- tween the Insertion of the Rhomboideus and the Origin of the Subscapularis. Action: To move the Scapula forwards or down- wards, according to the direction of its different Digi- tations ; and when the Scapula is forcibly raised, as in violent Inspiration, to assist in dilating the Thorax, by elevating the Ribs ; or if the Scapula be much depress- ed, the Serratus may then become a Muscle of Expira- tion.

89 Part I.] OF THE BONES. also covered with Cartilage, and placed upon the un- der part of the sides of the Arch. The two Superior Oblique Processes of one Verte- bra, articulated with the two Inferior Oblique of the Vertebra immediately above it. Round the edges of the Oblique Processes, rough Lines, for the attachment of their articulating Liga- ments. The two Transverse Processes projecting from the sides of the Arch, and between the Oblique Processes. The Spinous Process, sent out from the back part of the Arch, which, being sharp and pointed, gives name to the whole chain of Bones. The Edges of this Process, as well as of the Arch, rough, where Ligaments come off which fix the corre- sponding parts of the contiguous Vertebrae together. The substance of the Processes stronger, with a thicker external Plate than the Bodies of the Vertebrae. The Vertebrae are joined to each other by a double Articulation, their Bodies being connected by the In- tervertebral Substances already described; and their Oblique Processes so joined by their Ligaments, as to allow a small degree of motion to all sides. In a Foetus, each Vertebra consists of three pieces connected by Cartilages ; viz. the Body not fully ossi- fied, and a curved Bone on each side, forming a small share of the Bony Arch, on which are observed, the Oblique Processes complete, the beginning Transverse Processes, but no Spinal Process,

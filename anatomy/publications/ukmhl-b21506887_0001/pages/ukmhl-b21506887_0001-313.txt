Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. ^53 Intertransversales Lumborum. These are five distinct Muscles, which occupy the Spaces between the Transverse Processes of the last Dorsal, and of all the Lumbar Vertebrae, and serve to draw them a little towards each other. * Motions of the Head and Truhk. The Head is moved upon the Atlas,—^rrmrJ.y, by the Recti Capitis Anteriores Minores, and Recti Capi- tis Laterales ;—hachzvards, by the Recti Capitis Posti- ci Minores, and Obliqui Capitis Superiores;—laterally, by the Anterior and Posterior Muscles of the corre- sponding side. The Head and Neck are moved together,--;;/or- wards, partly through the medium of the Lower Jaw, by the Platysmse Myoides, Digastrici, Mylo-hyoidei, Genio-hyoidei, Genio-hyo-glossi ;—directly Jhrwards, by the Sterno-mastoidei, Recti Capitis Anteriores Ma- jores \—forwards^ through the Medium of the Larynx, by the Omo-hyoidei, Sterno-hyoidei, Sterno-thyroidei, and Thyro-hyoidei;—backwards, by the upper portion of the Trapezii, the Splenii Capitis, Complexi, Recti Capitis Postici Majores, and Trachelo-mastoidei;—la- terally, by the Opponent, or Anterior and Posterior Muscles of the corresponding side acting together. By a succession of these motions, the Head is enabled to describe a circle. The Rotation of the Head, or of the Atlas, upon the Vertebra Dentata, is performed by the following

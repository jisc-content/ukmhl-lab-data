118 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. brae, is Cellular, and only covered with a thin exter- nal Plate, which becomes somewhat thicker towards the Vertebrae. In a Foetus, the Heads and Tubercles of the Ribs have Cartilages, part of which become thin Epiphyses. After Birth, the Bodies of the Ribs encroach gradually on the Cartilages; hence the Cartilages of the Ribs are proportionally shorter in Adults than in Children. The Ribs give form to the Thorax, and compose a considerable portion of the Walls of the Abdomen. They cover and defend the Heart and Lungs, and as- sist the latter in performing respiration. They give Origin to the Serratus Magnus, Pectoralis Minor, Intercostales Externi et Interni, Subclavius, the three Scaleni, and Accessorii ad Sacro-lumbalem, —to part of the Diaphragm, of the Sterno-hyoideus, Sterno-thyroideus, Pectoralis Major, Latissimus Dor- si, Obliquus Externus, et Transversalis Abdominis ; —Insertion to the Intercostales Externi et Interni, Levatores Costarum, Sterno-costalis, Serrati Postici Superior et Inferior, Sacro-lumbalis,-—to part of the Longissimus Dor si, Quadratus Lumborum, Obliquus Internus, et Rectus Abdominis.

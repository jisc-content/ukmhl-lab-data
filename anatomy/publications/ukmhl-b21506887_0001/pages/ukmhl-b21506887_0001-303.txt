Pabt II ] of the MUSCLJIS. Splenius, Vel Cervico-mastoideus et Dbrso-cervicalis. Origiii: Tendinous, from the Spinous Processes of the four superior Dorsal; and Tendinous and Fleshy, from those of the five inferior Cervical Vertebrae. It adheres firmly to the Ligamentum Nuchae, and at the third Cervical Vertebra it recedes from its fellow, so that part of the Complexus is seen. Insertion : By as many Tendons into the five supe- rior Transverse Processes of the Cervical Vertebras, and by a Tendinous and Fleshy Portion, into the posterior part of the Mastoid Process, and into the Os Occipitis, where it joins with that Process. Action: To antagonize the Sterno-mastoideus, by bringing the Head, and upper Cervical Vertebrae, ob- liquely backwards and to one side. When the Splenii act together, they draw the Head directly backwards. This Muscle is divided by Albinus into Splenius Capitis, or that which arises from the Neck, and goes to the Head; and Splenius Colli, or that which arises from the Back, and is fixed to the Neck. Serratus Posticus Superior, vel Dorso-costalis. Origin: By a broad thin Tendon, from the Liga- mentum Nuchae, over the Spinous Processes of the three last Cervical, and two uppermost Dorsal Verte- brae ; going obliquely downwards. Insertion: By four Fleshy Slips, into the second, Q 2

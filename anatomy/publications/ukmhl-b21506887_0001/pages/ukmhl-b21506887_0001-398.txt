S38 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part III. tremities of the Cartilages of the Ribs, over the exter- nal Surface of the Sternum. Many of the Fibres of these Ligaments intermix with their fellows on the opposite side. The Capsular Ligaments of the Cartilages of the Ribs, which arise from the Margins of the Articular Cavities of the Sternum, within the Radiated Ligaments, and are fixed round the extremities of the Cartilages of the seven True Ribs. Within the Capsular Ligaments, the concave part of the Pits on the edges of the Ster- num are connected to the ends of the Cartilages of the Ribs, by fine Cellular Substance, which allows the Cartilages to roll upon the Sternum. The Membrane proper to the Sternum, which is a firm Expansion, composed of Tendinous Fibres run- ning in different directions, but chiefly in the longitu- dinal one, and covering the anterior and posterior Sur- faces of the Bone, the Membrane itself being confound- ed with the Periosteum. Ligaments of the Cartilago JEnsifbrmis, which are part of the proper Membrane of the Sternum, divided into strong Bands running obliquely from the under and fore part of the second Bone of the Sternum, and from the Cartilages of the seventh Pair of Ribs, to be fixed to the Cartilago Ensiformis.â€”The Ligaments co- vering the Sternum serve considerably to strengthen it. Thin Tendinous Expansions, which run over the Intercostales at the fore part of the Thorax, and con- nect the Cartilages of the Ribs to each other. They are chiefly seated in the spaces occupied by the Inter- costales Externi.

Part I.J OF THE BONES. 93 Processes have no Bifurcation, nor have the Transverse any perforations except in some rare cases. The Dorsal Vertebrce, commonly twelve in number; sometimes, however, eleven only; and at other times thirteen have been observed. The Bodies of the Dorsal Vertebrae, horizontal above and below, larger, sharper before, flatter at the sides, and more hollow behind, than those of the Cervical Vertebrae. A Pit, lined with Cartilage at each side of their up- per and under Edges, near the Transverse Processes, for the Articulation of the Heads of the Ribs. The Intervertebral Substances, thin to admit only of little motion; and thinnest anteriorly, to enlarge the Curve of the Spine, and increase the cavity of the Thorax. The Spinal Canal is here more Circular, but corre- sponding with the size of the Spinal Marrow,â€”is smaller than in any of the other Vertebrae. The Oblique Processes, having nearly a perpendicu- lar direction, the upper one slanting forwards, and the under ones backwards. The Transverse Processes, long, turned obliquely backwards, and enlarged at their outer extremity, where they are faced with Cartilage, to be articulated with the Tubercles of the Ribs. The Spi7ious Processes, long, thick at the roots, but slender near the extremities, and pointing obliquely downwards over each other, by which the Spinal Mar- row in this part is well protected. The upper edge of each of the Spinous Processes of these Vertebrae, formed into a Bidge, which, in certain

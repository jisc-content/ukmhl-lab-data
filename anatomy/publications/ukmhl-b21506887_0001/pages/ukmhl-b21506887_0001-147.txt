Part I.] OF THE BONES. 125 ta, for the passage of the superior Scapulary Vessels and Nerves. The inferior or anterior Costa^ extending obliquely downwards and backwards, between the third and eighth Ribs. The inferior Costa, impressed where it gives origin to the Teres Minor, the long Head of the Triceps Ex- tensor Cubiti, and Subscapularis. The posterior Costa^ or Base of the Bone, placed obliquely with respect to the Vertebrae, the upper end being considerably nearer than the under. The upper part of the Base, above the large Ridge termed Spine, running obliquely forwards to the upper angle, and giving attachment to the Levator Scapulae. The portion of the Base under the Spine, rough, for the insertion of the Rhomboides, and Serratus Major Anticus. The inferior Angle very acute, and marked behind by the passage of the Latissimus Dorsi, and the origin of the Teres Major. The superior Angle, approaching to a right Angle. The anterior Angle, forming the Cervix or Necl<:^ which descends from the Semilunar Notch, and sup- ports the Head of the Bone, which is considered as one of its Processes. The Glenoid {i. e. Shallow) Cavity, placed on the fore part of the Head of the Bone, and lined with Car- tilage for the articulation of the Os Humeri. The Cartilage lining this Cavity, thick at the edges, but thin toward the centre, by which it is rendered deeper, for receiving the Ball of the Os Humeri. The shape of this Cavity, resembling an Egg cut

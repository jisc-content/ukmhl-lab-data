183 Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. Oebicularis Oculi, vel Orb. Palpebrarum, Yel NasO'palpehralis. Origin: From the Orbitar Process of the Superior Maxillary Bone; from the internal angular Process of the Frontal Bone; and, by a small round Tendon, from the Nasal Process of the superior Maxillary Bone. From these Origins the Muscle passes outwards, un- der the Skin of the Eye-lids, surrounding the Orbit in a circular manner ; extending somewhat beyond it, and covering the upper part of the Cheek. Insertion : Into the Skin of the Eye-lids, its upper and inner Edge being intimately connected with the Frontal and Corrugator Muscles. Action : To close the Eye by bringing the Eye-lids together, to press the Ball of the Eye inwards, and act upon the Lacrymal Organs, so as to assist them in the production and direction of the Tears. That part of the Orbicularis Oculi which covers the Cartilages of the Eye-lids, and which is remarkably thin, is the Musculus Ciliaris of some Authors. A Fleshy Slip frequently passes down from the un- der and outer part of the Orbicularis, to join the Le- vator Labii Superioris Alaeque Nasi. When present, it may draw a little towards each other those parts to which it is attached.

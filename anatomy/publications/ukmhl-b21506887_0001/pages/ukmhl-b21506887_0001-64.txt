44 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. the Condyles, corresponding with the superior articu- lating Process of the Atlas. The Condyles run obliquely forwards and inwards, and are deepest at their inner parts; in consequence of which they are prevented from sliding to either side out of the Cavities of the Atlas. In some Subjects, each of the Condyles is more or less divided transversely, giving the appearance of two Prominences. Round their roots, the surface is unequal, for the attachment of the Capsular Ligaments connecting this Bone to the first one of the Neck. The rough Prominence at the outer sides of the Con- dyles, for the insertion of the Recti Capitis Laterales; and, anterior to these Prominences, the Semilunar Notches, or Jugular Fossae, which form part of the Holes common to the Temporal and Occipital Bones. The Flexion and Extension of the Head are perform- ed at the Condyles, but they are found to be placed be- hind its centre of gravity, which affords space for the Mouth, Throat, &c. ; and the Head is prevented from falling forwards by the constant action of the strong Ex- tensor Muscles, placed on the back part of the Neck. The internal Surface of the Bone hollow^ for con- taining the back part of the Brain. The Cruciform Spine of the inner side, formed by two Ridges, the one placed perpendicularly in the mid- dle of the Bone, the other crossing the first in a hori- zontal direction. The Internal Occipital Protuberance, at the middle of the Cruciform Spine, where the longitudinal Sinus ends in the two lateral Sinuses.

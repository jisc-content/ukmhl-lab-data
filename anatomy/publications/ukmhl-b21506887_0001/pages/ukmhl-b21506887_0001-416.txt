This Ligament allows the Thigh-Bone to be moved inwards, and the Glandular-looking Substance to be agitated with safety. The Substance called Gland of the Joint, covered with a Vascular Membrane, and lying flat in a Depres- sion in the under and inner part of the Acetabulum. At the edges of this Substance Fringes are sent out^ which furnish part of the Synovia for the lubrication of the Joint. The edges of this Substance are fixed to those of the Pit in the Acetabulum, by small Ligamentous Bridles, termed Ligamenta Mucosa, vel Ligamentula Masses A- diposo-glandulosce. Ligaments, &c. of the Joint of the Knee. The Lateral Ligaments, which lie at the side of the Joint, and adhere to the outer Surface of the Capsular Ligament. The Internal Lateral Ligament, which is of consi- derable breadth, arising from the upper part and Tu- bercle of the Internal Condyle of the Os Femoris, and inserted into the upper and inner part of the Tibia ; the Fibres passing obliquely forwards, till they have reached a little below the Head of the Bone. The Long External Lateral Ligament, v/hich is nar- rower, but thicker and stronger than the former, aris- ing from the Tubercle above the External Condvle oÂ£

Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. 179 Sartorius ;—Simple Penniform, as in the Peroneus Longus;—Complete Penniform., as in the Rectus Fe- moris ;—Compound Penniform, as in the fore part of the Soleus;—Radiated, as in the Pectoralis Major ;— Holloxio, as in the Heart, Intestines, Bladder of Urine, &c. The particular Names of Muscles are taken from their shape, size, situation, direction, composition, use^ and attachment. The Names adopted by the Author are those in common use, being in general as expressive as any yet contrived. Those of Chaussier are added, which are taken from the attachments of the Muscles, but, in many cases, a number of principal attachments are ex- cluded ; besides, several of his names consist of so many syllables, as to become burdensome to the me- mory. Muscles are supplied with Blood-vessels, which are so numerous, that when a good Injection is thrown into them, they acquire the same colour with that of the injected matter. They are also abundantly supplied with Absorbents, which, however, are rather seen in the Cellular Tex- ture of their Interstices, than in their Substance the Valves preventing an Injection from passing from their Trunks to their small Extremities. The Nerves of Muscles are likewise very numerous; but although the Muscles were called by some Au- thors, among others Dr Cullen, the moving extremi- ties of the Nerves, the latter bear a very small propor- tion to the former, and the Muscles appear to be quite of a different nature from the Nerves.

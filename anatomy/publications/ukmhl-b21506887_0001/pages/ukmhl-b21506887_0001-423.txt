Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS. 36^ The Superior Superficial, and the Plantar Liga- ments, which connect the Os Cuboides to the Os Cu- neiforme Externum. The Dorsal and the Plantar Ligaments, which unite the Ossa Cuneiformia to each other. Besides the Capsular Ligaments of the Tarsus already mentioned, each of the other Joints of these Bones is furnished with its proper Capsular Ligament. From the plainness of the Articulating Surfaces of the Bones of the Tarsus, and from the strength of the Ligaments which unite them to each other, no more motion is allowed than to prevent the effects of con- cussion in walking, leaping, &c. Ligaments hetioeen the Tarsus and Metatarsus. The Bones of the Metatarsus are fixed to those of the Tarsus by Capsular, and numerous other Ligaments, which are called Dorsal, Plantar, and Lateral, accord- ing to their situations ;â€”and Sti^aight, Oblique, or Transverse, according to their directions. The nature of this Joint is the same as that between the Carpus and Metacarpus. ^ ^ i>tu Ligaments connectifig the Metatarsal Bones to each other. The Dorsal, Plantar, and Lateral Uigaments, which connect the Bases of the Metatarsal Bones with each other. '1 he Transverse Ligaments v^^liich join the Heads of these Bones together.

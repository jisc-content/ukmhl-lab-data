112 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. ■^Insertion to the Psoas Parvus, and to part of the Obliquus Externus Abdominis. Use of the Pelvis.—The Pelvis constitutes the Basis of the Trunk, and forms Sockets for the Thigh- bones to move in. It contains the Bladder of Urine and the Rectum in a Male, and together with these, the Uterus in a Female. It gives origin to the Mus- cles which extend the Trunk, and attachment to those which bend the Body. It sends off the principal part of the Muscles which move the Thigh, and gives pas- sage and protection to Blood-vessels, and to some of the largest Nerves of the Body. In a Foetus, the Spine of the Os Ilium, and that part of the Bone which belongs to the Acetabulum, are Cartilaginous. The Spinous Process, the Tube- rosity, and Crus of the Os Ischium, the Crus of the Os Pubis, and that portion of it which forms the Ace- tabulum, are also in a Cartilaginous state. The shape of the Cavity of the Pelvis, at this period, is altogether different from that in an Adult, the under being wider than the upper part.

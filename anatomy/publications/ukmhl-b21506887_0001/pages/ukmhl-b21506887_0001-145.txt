Part I.] OF THE BONES. 123 Bone marked by the strong Ligaments, which fix it to the Sternum. The Body of the Bone next the Sternum, bent for- wards^ and that next the Scapula turned backy the whole resembling an Italicor a key used by the An- cients, from which, or from the support, like a beam, it gives to the shoulder, its name is derived. The upper part of the Clavicle, next the Sternum, rounded^ the extremity, next the Scapula, thin and flat where it lies over the Joint of the Humerus. Over 'the Bone in general, rough marks are observ- ed, for the attachment of Muscles and Ligaments. The under Surface hollow, for lodging a portion of the Subclavius. In the under Surface, and near the middle, one or more small Canals, leading obliquely outwards, for the passage of the Medullary Vessels. The Eooternal or Scapulary Extremity, oval and flat, and tipped with Cartilage, to be articulated with the Acromion of the Scapula. Near the back part of the Scapular extremity, a Tubercle, for the attachment of a strong Ligament, which connects this Bone to the Coracoid Process of the Scapula. The substance of this Bone is like that of other long^ round Bones, but the external Table is of considerable thickness and strength. The Clavicle supports the Shoulder at a proper dis- tance from the Thorax, and thereby renders the mo- tion of the Arm more extensive. It gives attachmen to several Muscles, and defence to lurge Vessels and Nerves.

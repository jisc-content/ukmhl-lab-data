284 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pabi 11. MUSCLES OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITIES, MUSCLES ON THE PELVIS and THIGH, serv- ing FOR THE MOTION OF THE THIGH AND LEG. Aponeurosis of the Inferior Extremity. Previous to the description of the Muscles of the Inferior Extremity, it is proper to take notice of the Fascia Lata^ or Tendinous Expansion, -which, as in the Superior Extremity, forms a general Covering to the Muscles, and sends off Partitions between them, to be connected to the Ridges and Processes of the Bones. It is thick and strong on the outside of the Thigh and Leg, but towards the inner side of both, particu- larly on the former, it gradually becomes thinner, and has rather the appearance of Cellular Membrane. It descends from the Processes and other Projections on the outside of the Bones of the Pelvis, but more especially from the Tendons of the external Layers of the Muscles of the Loins and Abdomen,â€”See the de- scription of the upper part of this Fascia in p. 211.

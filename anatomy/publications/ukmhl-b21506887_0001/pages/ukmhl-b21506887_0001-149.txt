Part OF THE BONES. The anterior Edge of the Acromion, tipped with Cartilage for its articulation with the outer end of the Clavicle. The Coracoid, or Crow's-heah-lihe Process^ arising from the Neck of the Bone, and making a curvature forwards, so as to leave a hollow at its root for the passage of the Subseapularis. The Point qf this Process^ which gives origin to the Pectoralis Minor, short Head of the Biceps, the Cora- co-Brachialis, and to a strong Ligament which passes transversely from its side, to be fixed to the Acromion, for the protection of the Joint. At the upper part of the root of this Process, a small Tubercle^ which gives attachment to a Ligament of the Clavicle. The substance of the Bone is very unequal in thick- ness ; for the Inferior Costa and Processes are thick and strong,^ while the Body is so pressed by its own Muscles, especially in old people, as to become in many parts transparent. The Scapula h joined to the Clavicle by Ligaments of such strength, as only to allow between these two Bones a small degree of motion, and that chiefly of a twisting nature; but the Scapula is so connected by Muscles to the Head, Os Hyoides, Trunk, and Arm, as to have motion upwards, downwards, and to either side, and, through the medium of the Clavicle, to be rolled upon the top of the Sternum. The Scapula serves as a support to the Arm, forms a socket for the Arm-Bone to move in, and has nume- rous Muscles so attached to it, as to assist in enabling the Arm to act freely in all directions. It also serves

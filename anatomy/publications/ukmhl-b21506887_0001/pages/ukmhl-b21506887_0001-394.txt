8S4 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part III. the Condyloid Processes, and which is twisted in the rotation of the Head. The Two Lateral, or Moderator Ligaments, which arise each from the side of the Processus Dentatus, and run outwards and upwards, to be fixed to the inner part of the side of the Atlas, and to the inner edge of the Foramen Magnum at the fore part of the Condyles. They are short, but of great strength, and prevent the Head from turning too far round. The Transverse Ligament, which arises from the inner side of the Atlas, and going across behind the Processus Dentatus, is fixed to the opposite side of the Atlas. The edges of this Ligament extend upwards and downwards, and form two Processes, called its Appen- dices, which are fixed to the Foramen Magnum and Processus Dentatus. The middle of the Ligament is remarkably firm where that Process plays upon it. It keeps the Processus Dentatus in its place, and prevents it from injuring the Spinal Marrow in the different motions of the Head. In persons who suffer Death from suspension by the Neck, this Ligament, and some of the others near it, are sometimes so much ruptured, as to allow a partial dislocation to take place, or the Processus Dentatus to be thrust back upon the Spinal Marrow; but this is not a common occurrence. Ligaments of the other Vertebr.e. The Anterior common Ligament of the Vertebrae, which is a strong Tendinous band, extending along the

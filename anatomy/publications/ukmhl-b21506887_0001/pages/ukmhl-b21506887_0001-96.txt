74 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The Two Orhitar Processes^ at the upper and back part of the Nasal Plate, contributing a little in the for- mation of the Orbit, and of the Ethmoid and Sphenoid Sinuses, being hollow within. The Anterior Orbitar Process, the larger of the two, with its upper Surface appearing in the bottom of the Orbit, behind the back part of the Os Planum and Os Maxillare. A Notch between the Orbitar Processes, forming part of the Foramen Spheno-Palatinum; and sometimes this a complete Foramen, for the passage of the Nasal Ves- sels and Nerves, the former belonging to the Internal Maxillary, and the latter to the second portion of the Fifth Pair. The Foramen Palatinum Posterius, vel Palato-Maoc- illare^ at the outer end of the Palate-Plate of this Bone, but common to it and the Maxillary Bone, for the trans- mission of Nerves of the Second Branch of the Fifth Pair, with associate Blood-Vessels, which are the prin- ciple Nerves and Vessels of the Palate. A small Hole frequently observed behind the former, and communicating with it, for the passage of a Branch of the Palatine Nerve. The Foramen Spheno-Maooillare, Lacerum Inferius^ or Irvferior Orhitar Fissure^ at the under arid outer part of the Orbit, and common to the Cuneiform, Max- illary. Malar, and Palate Bones, for lodging Fat be- longing to the Eye, and transmitting small Twigs of Vessels and Nerves into the Orbit. The Palate-Plate of this Bone and its Pterygoid Process are firm and strong ; but the Nasal Plate and Orbitar Processes are thin and brittle.

The first Vertebra, called Atlas^ from its supporting the Globe of the Head, having only a small Arch in- stead of a Body. The upper and under Surfaces of the Arch, marked by the Ligaments which fix it to the Head and second Vertebra. The back part of the Arch holloxv, and covered hy a smooth Cartilage, where it turns upon the Processus Dentatus of the second Vertebra. The inner parts of the sides of the Vertebra, be- tween the superior and inferior oblique Processes, marked by the Lateral Ligaments which go to the Pro- cessus Dentatus, and by the Transverse Ligament which passes behind that Process. The Foramen Vertebrale, larger than in any of the other Vertebrae, for receiving in its fore part the Tooth- like Process of the second Vertebra, and in its back part the beginning of the Spinal Marrow. An Arch upon the back part of the Atlas, instead of a Spinous Process, marked by Muscles and Ligaments. The Superior Oblique Processes, oval, slanting, and hollow, for receiving the Condyles of the Occipital Bone. A Curved Fossa under the outer and back part of each Oblique Process, for the passage of the Vertebral Arteries into the Head, and Tenth Pair of Nerves out of it. The, Transverse Processes, longer than in any other Cervical Vertebra, for the origin of several Muscles. The comiexion of the Atlas to the Occipital Bone^

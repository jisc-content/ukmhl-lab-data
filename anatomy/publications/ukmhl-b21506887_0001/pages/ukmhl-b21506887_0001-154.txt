13^ COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. meri are the same as in other long round Bones. The sides are compact, but the Cancelli are so large in the middle of the Bone, as to give the appearance of a hol- low Cylinder. The Ball of the Os Humeri is articulated with the Glenoid Cavity of the Scapula, which, from its super- ficial nature, and the long Ligaments inclosing the Joint, allows the Arm to move in all directions ; the Bone even performing a small degree of motion round its own axis. The extent of motion of the Arm, how- ever, is considerably increased by the rolling of the Scapula. The Os Humeri gives origin to the Brachialis Inter- nus, second and third Heads of the Triceps Extensor Cubiti, Extensores Carpi Radiales Longior et Brevior, Supinator Radii Longus, Anconeus, Extensor Digito- rum Communis, and Palmaris Longus;—to part of the Supinator Radii Brevis, of the Extensor Carpi Ulnaris, Pronator Radii Teres, Flexor Carpi Radialis, Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, and Flexor Digitorum Sublimis.—In- sertion to the Deltoides, Supra-spinatus, Infra-spina- tus, Teretes Major et Minor, Subscapularis, Latissi- mus Dorsi, Pectoralis Major, and Coraco-brachialis. In a Foetus, the extremities of the Bone are Car- tilaginous ; and the Ball with the Tubercles, and the Trochlea with the Condyles, form afterwards Epi- physes, previously to their union with the Body of the Bone.

Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS. 333 serving to support the Stylo-glossus, and to give origin to part of it. The Lateral Ligament, which arises from the Margin of the Articular Cavity of the Temporal Bone, and is inserted into the inner Surface of the Angle of the Lower Jaw, near its posterior Foramen ;â€”assisting to keep the Jaw in situ, and to prevent the inferior Maxil- lary Vessels and Nerve from being injured by the ac- tion of the Pterygoid Muscle. Ligaments connecting the Head with the first and se- cond Vertebra of the Neck, and these two Verte- BRiE with each other. The two Capsular Ligaments, which arise from the margin of the superior articulating Processes of the Atlas, and are inserted into the Base of the Condyles of the Occipital Bone, where the Head has its flexion and extension without rotation. The Circular Ligament, which arises from the edge of the Spinal Hole of the first Vertebra, is connected with the Capsular Ligaments of the superior articu- lating Processes of the Atlas, and is inserted into the edge of the Foramen Magnum of the Occipital Bone. The two Capsular Ligaments, which fix the inferior oblique Processes of the Atlas to the superior oblique of the Vertebra Dentata, and admit of the rotation of the Head, with a small degree of flexion to either side. The Perpendicular Ligament, which fixes the Pro- cessus Dentatus of the Second Vertebra to the edge of the anterior part of the Foramen Magnum, between

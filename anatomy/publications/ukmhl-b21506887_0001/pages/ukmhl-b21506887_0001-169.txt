Part I.] OF THE BONES. 147 dicis ;â€”Insertion to the Opponens Pollicis, and to part of the Extensor Ossis Metacarpi Pollicis. Bones of the Fingers. The Fingers, composed each of three Bones; the three Rows of Bones, taken transversely, termed Phalanges. The different Phalanges, tapering a little as they de- scend, and their Bases larger than their inferior extre- mities. The posterior Surfaces convex, and covered chiefly by the Tendinous Expansions of the Extensors of the Fingers. Their anterior Surfaces flat, and in some parts con- cave, for lodging the Tendons of the Flexor Muscles. Ridges at the side of their anterior Surfaces, for the attachment of the retaining Ligaments of the Tendons of the Flexor Muscles. The Phalanges, in general, have inserted into them the Extensor Digitorum Communis. The first or Metacarpal Phalanx, longer than the second or middle, and the second than the third. The Bases or upper ends of the first Phalanx form- ed into Sockets, to receive the Balls of the Metacarpal Bones, and to allow motion to all sides. The lower ends of this Phalanx, consisting of late- ral Prominences, and middle Cavities or Pulleys, the Cartilaginous Surfaces of which reach considerably farther up in the fore than in the back part. The first Phalanx, by means of the Extensor Digi- torum Communis, gives Insertion to the Lumbricales and Interossei, K 2

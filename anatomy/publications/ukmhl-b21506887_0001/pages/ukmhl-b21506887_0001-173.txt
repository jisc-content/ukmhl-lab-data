A rough Pit at the inner part of the Ball, a little below its middle^ and destitute of Cartilage, for the attachment of the Ligamentum Rotundum, which is fixed by its other end to the bottom of the Acetabulum. The CervioCy or Neck, much longer than that of any other Bone, passing obliquely downwards and outwards from the Ball, to allow the free motion of the Body of the Bone in different directions. Numerous Holes in the Cervix, for the Insertion of the Fibres of the Ligament reflected from the Capsu- lar one.

A Cavity, termed Fossa Trochanteria, placed at the inner side of the Root of the large Trochanter, for the Insertion of the Rotator Muscles of the Thigh. The Trochanter Minor, at the under and inner part of the Cervix, for the Insertion of the Flexor Muscles of the Thigh. The Trochanter Minor is small and pointed, and, in a Subject, is so much covered by Muscles, as to be out of the reach of the Finger. A rough Li7ie on the fore part of the Bone, extend-

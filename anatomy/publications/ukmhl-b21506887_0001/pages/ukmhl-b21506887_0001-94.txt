72 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. largest of all the Sinuses of the Head, occupying, the whole inner part of the Body of the Bone. It is situat- ed under the Orbitar Plate, and above the large Den- tes Molares, and destined for the same purposes as the other Sinuses of the Bones of the Head. The Partition between the Sinus and Sockets of the Teeth is commonly of considerable thickness; but not unfrequently there is only a thin Plate interposed, and small Prominences, containing the points of the roots of the Teeth, may often be observed in the middle of this Cavity. The Opening of the Sinus, large in the separated Maxillary Bone, but, in the connected state, so covered by the Os Spongiosum Inferius, and by the Palate Bone and Membranes, as to leave only one, and sometimes two Apertures, little larger than to admit the point of a Surgeon's Probe. The Aperture is situated at the upper part of the Sinus, and descends obliquely back- wards to terminate in the Cavity of the Nose, between the Ossa Spongiosa Superius et Inferius. The Substance of this Bone is hard and dense, ex- cept at the Alveoli, where it is remarkably Spongy. The connexion of the Bone to the Os Frontis, by the Transverse Suture,—to the Os Unguis, by the Lacry- mal Suture,—to the Os Nasi, by the Lateral Nasal Suture,—to the Os Malae, by the internal and exter- nal Orbitar Sutures,—to the Os Planum, by the Eth- moid Suture,—to its fellow, by the longitudinal Palate Suture,—to its fellow also, between the fore part of / the Nose and Mouth, by the Mystachial Suture. The Ossa Maxillaria form the greater part of the Nose and Roof of the Mouth, a considerable part of

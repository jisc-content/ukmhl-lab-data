It forms a large, thick, and strong Muscle, which fills the hollow between the Spine, and angles of the Ribs} becoming gradually smaller in its ascent. Insertion : Into the Transverse Processes of all the Dorsal Vertebrae, chiefly by small double Tendons; and, by a Tendinous and Fleshy Slip, into the lower Edge of each of the Ribs, excepting the two inferior, near their Tubercles. Action : To extend the Trunk, and keep it erect; the outer part may assist in depressing the Ribs dur- ing laborious Expiration. From the upper part of this Muscle, a round Fleshy Slip runs up to join the Cervicalis Descendens. Spinalis Dorsi. Origin : By five Tendinous Slips, from the Spinous Processes of the two upper Lumbar, and the three lower Dorsal Vertebras. In its ascent, it is incorpo- rated with the Longissimus Dor si. Insertion: Into the Spinous Processes of the eight or nine uppermost Dorsal Vertebrae, excepting the first, by as many Tendons.

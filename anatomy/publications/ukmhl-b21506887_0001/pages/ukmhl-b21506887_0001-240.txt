180 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. The Nerves of voluntary Muscles have been de- scribed by some Writers as being much larger than those of the involuntary kind, as the Heart; but this circumstance has been exaggerated. In various parts of the Body, the Muscles receive their Nerves from different origins, and many antago- nist Muscles receive Nerves from the same source. The Tendon, like the Fleshy part of the Muscle, is of a Fibrous nature, but is not merely Muscle harden- ed by pressure, as was formerly by some Authors sup- posed ; for, in many instances. Tendons have a differ- ent direction from the Muscles to which they belong. Tendon is distinguished from the Flesh by being ge- nerally smallery firmer, stronger;â€”of a white glistening colour, having no contractility, and little or no sensibi- lity in the sound state. From long boiling, it is ob- served to afford a large portion of Gelatin. Tendons, like Muscles, vary considerably in their form, as round, fiat, annular^ &c. Tendons have very few Blood-vessels, and no evident Nerves. Tendons in general connect Muscles to Bones. In some places they unite Cartilages or Bones to each other. In others, they bind down and fortify parts over which they pass, and, by the smallness of their size compared to the Belly of the Muscle, preserve the elegance and symmetry of the parts on which they are placed. Besides the parts of Muscles already taken notice of, they have the following Appendages, viz. Aponeuroses, or FascicB, which are the Tendons ex- panded upon a wide Surface, serving to give Insertion

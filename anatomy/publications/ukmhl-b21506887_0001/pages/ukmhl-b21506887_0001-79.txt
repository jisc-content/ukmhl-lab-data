Part I.j OF THE BONES. 59 and fore part of the Bone. This Process is often bent to one side, dividing the two Nostrils unequally. The Clinoid Processes, seen on the inside of the Bone, compared to the supporters of a bed, of which there are, Tivo Anteriory projecting from the fore and lateral part of the Body of the Bone, and extending horizon- tally outwards ; each terminating in a point which ob- tains the name of Transverse Spinous Process. One Posterior, situated transversely, some way be- hind the anterior Processes, but projecting obliquely upwards and forwards, and frequently ending in two Knobs, which also incline a little forwards, and form two Posterior Clinoid Processes. Sometimes one or both of the Anterior Clinoid Pro- cesses are united with the posterior, forming an Arch over the internal Carotid Artery. The Processus Olivaris, a small ridge running trans- versely between, and a little behind, the roots of the anterior Clinoid Processes, and considered by some as a fourth Clinoid Process. Between the anterior Clinoid Processes, a small points ed Process frequently juts forwards, to join the Cribri- form Plate of the Ethmoid Bone, from which it is sometimes called Ethmoid Process. The Temporal Fosscb of this Bone, which lodge a share of the lateral Lobes of the Brain. A Fossa between the anterior Clinoid Processes, where part of the anterior Lobes of the Brain rests. A Depression before the Processus Olivaris, where the conjoined Optic Nerves lie; and a Fossa on each

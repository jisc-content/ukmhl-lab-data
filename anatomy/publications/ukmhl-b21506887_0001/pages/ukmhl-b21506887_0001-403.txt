Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS. 243 LIGAMENTS OF THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. Ligaments of the Clavicle. The Radiated Ligaments^ which arise from the outer Surface of the inner end of the Clavicle, and are fixed round the edge of the corresponding Articular Cavity of the Sternum. The Capsular Ligament, which lies within the former. The Inter-articular Cartilage, which divides the Joint into two distinct Cavities, and accommodates the arti- culating Surfaces of the Clavicle and Sternum. The Inter-clavicular Ligament, joining the Clavicles together behind the top of the Sternum, and partly- formed by a continuation of the Radiated Ligaments. By the Ligaments of this Joint, with the assistance of the intervening Cartilage, the Shoulder is allowed to move in different directions, as upon a centre. The Ligamentum Rhomboideum, which arises from the inferior rough Surface at the anterior extremity of

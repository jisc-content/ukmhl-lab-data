U6 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part CoMPLEXus, vel Trachelo-occipitalis. Origin: By distinct Tendons, from the Transverse Processes of the seven superior Dorsal, and four infe- rior Cervical Vertebras, and, by a Fleshy Slip, from the Spinous Process of the first Dorsal Vertebra. In its passage upwards, it is intermixed with Tendinous and Fleshy parts. Insertion : Into a Depression, under the middle of the large arched Ridge of the Occipital Bone. Action : To draw the Head backwards, and to one side; and when both act, to draw" the Head directly backwards. The long Portion of the Muscle, which lies next the Spinous Processes, is more loose than the rest, and has a roundish Tendon in the middle of it, with a Fleshy Belly at each end, on which account it is called by Albinus, Biventer Cervicis. Trachelo-Mastoideus, Vel Complexus Minor, vel Mastoideus Lateralis. Origin: From the Transverse Processes of the three uppermost Dorsal, and five lowest Cervical Vertebras^ where it is connected to the TransversaUs Cervicis, by as many thin Tendons, which unite into a slender Belly, and run up under the Splenius. Insertion : Into the superior Margin of the Mastoid Process of the Temporal Bone, by a thin Tendon.

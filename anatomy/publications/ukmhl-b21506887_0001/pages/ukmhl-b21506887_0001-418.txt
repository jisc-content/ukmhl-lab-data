358 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part III. fixed round the Head of the Tibia, and into the whole Margin of the Articulating Surface of the Patella, in such a manner that the Patella forms part of the Cap- sule of the Joint. The Capsular Ligament is of itself remarkably thin, but so covered by the Ligaments already mentioned, by the general Aponeurosis of the Limb, and by the Tendons of Muscles which surround the Joint, as to acquire a considerable degree of strength. The Capsular, with the other' Ligaments of this Joint, admit of the flexion and extension of the Leg, but of no lateral nor rotatory motion in the extended state, though of a small degree of each when the Limb is fully bent. The Ligamentum Alare, Mqjus et Minits, which are Folds of the Capsular Ligament, running like Wings at the sides of tlio Patella, to which, and to the Fatty Substance of the Joint, they are attached. The Ligamentum Mucosiim, continued from the join- ing of the Ligamenta Alaria to the Os Femoris, im- mediately above the Anterior Crucial Ligament. It preserves the Synovial Substance in its proper place, during the various motions of the Joint. The two Cmicial or Internal Ligaments, which arise from the Semilunar Notch between the Condyles of the Os Femoris, and decussate each other within the Cavity of the Joint. The Antejior Crucial Ligament runs downwards and forwards, to be fixed to a Pit before the rough Protu- berance in the middle of the Articulating Surface of the Head of the Tibia. The Postei'ior Crucial Ligament descends to be fixed

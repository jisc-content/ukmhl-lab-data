no COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part L excepting at its under, inner, and fore part, where there is a rough Depression for containing the greater portion of the substance mentioned above.

In the Inferior Opening, the proportions are reversed, the distance between the Symphysis Pubis and Os Coccygis being longer than that between the Ossa Ilia. The depth of the fore part of the Pelvis, at the Symphysis of the Pu- bis, is about an inch and a half, behind it is six inches, and at the sides three inches and a half. The Pelvis may vary from the above dimensions according to the size and proportions of the Body, which may differ somewhat in the different nations, yet be well formed; or it may vary from disease either of the Bones or Vis- cera, and then it is considered as distorted.

^62 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part III. Tibia and Fibula, and is fixed round the edge of the Articular Surface of the Astragalus. The Ligaments and the other constituent parts of the Ankle-joint form it into a complete Hinge, which allows flexion and extension, but no rotation nor late- ral motion in the bended state of the Foot, though a small degree of each when it is fully extended. Ligaments of the Tarsus. The Capsular Ligament^ which joins the Articular Surface of the Os Calcis to that of the Astragalus. A number of Sliort Ligaments, lying in the Fossa of the Astragalus and of the Os Calcis, and forming the Ligamentous Apparatus of the Sinuous Cavity, which assists in fixing the two Bones strongly together. The Capsular^ the Broad Superior, and the Internal Lateral Ligaments, connecting the Astragalus to the Os Naviculare, and admitting of the lateral and rota- tory motions of the Foot. 1 he Superior, the Lateral, and the Inferior Liga- ments, fixing the Os Calcis to the Os Cuboides, where a small degree of motion is allowed to every side. The inferior Ligaments consist of a Long, an Oblique, and SiRliomhoiclLigament, v/hich are the longest and strong- est of the Sole. The Superior Superjicial, the Interosseous, and the hferior Transverse Ligaments, whicli fix the Os Navi- culare and Os Cuboides to each other. The Superior Lateral, and the Plantar Ligaments, vvhich fix the Os Naviculare to the Os CuxieiformG.

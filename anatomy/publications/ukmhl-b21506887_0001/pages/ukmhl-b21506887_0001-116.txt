94> COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. V motions of the Spine, is received by a Groove in the under part of the Spinous Process of the Vertebra im- mediately above it. The last peculiarity of Structure, with the others already mentioned, prevent the Dorsal Vertebrae from having much motion. The Spinous Processes becoming gradually larger and more oblique, from the fourth to the eighth or ninth, from which downwards, they are shorter and placed more horizontally, the undermost Vertebra of the Back resembling the uppermost of the Loins. The Bodies of the four uppermost Dorsal Vertebj-ae, contrary to the general rule, becoming smaller as they descend, which allows the Trachea to divide at a sharp angle. The Jirst Dorsal Vertebra, having the whole of the Pit for the Head of the uppermost Rib formed in it. The eleventh Dorsal Vertebra, wanting the Articular Surface on its Transverse Process, and frequently hav- ing the whole cavity for the Head of the eleventh Rib on its Body. The twelfth Dorsal Vertebra, receiving the whole Head of the last Rib, and having no Cartilaginous Sur- face on its Transverse Process. The Lumbar VertebrcE, or those of the Loins, com- monly five, seldom six, and still more rarely four in number. The Bodies of the Lumbar Vertebrae larger and broader than those of the other two classes. The Intervertebral Snhstances, the thickest of any, and most so at their fore part, by which the Spine is

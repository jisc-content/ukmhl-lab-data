In a Foetus the Clavicle is completely formed. Scapula. The Situation of the Scapula, upon the upper and back part of the Thorax, at some distance from the Ribs, the interval being occupied by a cushion of flesh composed of the Serratus Magnus and Subscapularis. The shape of the Scapula triangular, with one of the angles placed downwards. The Venter, or inner Surface, concave, correspond- ing with the convexity of the Ribs, and marked with Ridges and Depressions which run in a radiated man- ner towards the Cervix of the Bone ; pointing out the attachments of the Subscapularis, and the impressions made by that Muscle. The Dorsum, or outer Surface of the Scapula, ren- dered convex in some parts, and concave in others, by the action of the Muscles which cover it. The body of the Scapula is remarl<;ably thin, and, in an old person, transparent. The three Edges of the Bone thic1<: and strong, and termed Costce. The Superior or Cervical Costa, the sJiortest of the three, and placed nearly opposite to the second Rib.

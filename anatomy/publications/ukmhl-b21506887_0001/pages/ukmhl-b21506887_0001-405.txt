Pakt III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS. 345 assists in protecting the upper and inner part of the Joint of the Humerus. The Proper Posterior Ligament of the Scapula^ which is sometimes double, and is stretched across the Semi- lunar Notch of the Bone, forming that Notch into one or two Holes for the passage of the superior-posterior Scapulary Vessels and Nerve. Ligaments, &c. of the Joint of the Shoulder. The Capsular Ligament, which arises from the Cer- vix of the Scapula, behind the Margin of the Glenoid Cavity, and is fixed round the Neck of the Os Hume- ri, loosely inclosing the Ball of the Bone. A small Fimbriated Organ within the Capsular Li- gament, for the Secretion of part of the Synovia. A Sheath sent down from the fore part of the Cap- sular Ligament, between the Tuberosities of the Os Humeri, which incloses the Tendon of the long Head of the Biceps Flexor Cubiti, and prevents it from start- ing out of its place. Additional Ligamentous Bands of the Capsular Li- gament, which adhere to its anterior Surface. What gives most strength to this Joint, as well as to several other Joints of the Body, is the covering from the surrounding Muscles. From the shallowness of the Glenoid Cavity, from the extent and looseness of the Capsular Ligament, and from the structure of the other parts of the Joint, more extensive motion is allowed to the Os Humeri than to any other Bone of the Body; as it can not only movo

Origin: Higher on the Os Malae than the former Muscle. It is situated before it, and takes the same course, but is much more slender. Insertion : Into the upper Lip, along with the Le- vator Anguli Oris. Action : To assist the former Muscle in raising the Corner of the Mouth, and drawing it obliquely out- wards.

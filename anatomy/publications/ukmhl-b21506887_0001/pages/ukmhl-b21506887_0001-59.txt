It gives origin to the Gorrugator Supercilii, to part of the Temporalis and its Aponeurosis^ and of the Or- bicularis Palpebrarum. It gives insertion to part of the Occipito-Frontalis, and to the Trochlea of the Trochlearis. In a Foetus of nine months, the Os Frontis is divid- ed longitudinally through its middle into two pieces which are incomplete at their upper and back part, where they assist in the formation of the Bregma or opening of the Head.â€”The Superciliary Holes and Frontal Sinuses are not yet formed, the latter not ap- pearing till several years after birth. OssA Parietalia. The parts here to be attended to are, The situation of the Ossa Parietalia, in the upper and lateral parts of the Cranium. The figure of each Parietal Bone a Trapezium, or approaching that of a Square. The Superior or Sagittal Margin^ the longest and straightest. The Anterior or Coronal edge, next in length. The Posterior, Occipital, or Lambdoid edge, shorter. The Inferior, or Temporal, shortest and thinnest, and in form of a ragged Arch, to be connected to the upper rounded edge of the Squamous part of the Tem- poral Bone. The three first edges of the Bone ragged, where they , assist in forming the true Sutures.

5 Part I.] OF THE BONES. ' CaNCELLI OF THE BoNES. The Inner Parts of Bones in general, whether long, round, or flat, have their Plates and Threads running in various directions, intersecting each other, and form- ing the CanceUi, Lattice-worJc, or Sjpongy Substance of the Bones ; the Cancelli communicating every where with each other. The Cancelli^ in the middle of long Bones, are Fi- brous, and form the Reticular Substance which divides the Bone into large Cells. Towards the extremities of long Bones, the Cancelli are lamellated, and much more numerous than in their middle. Cancelli, of a similar nature to those of the long Bones, are also placed between the Tables of flat, and inner parts of round Bones. In some of the broad Bones, however, as the Sca- pula, the solid parts are so much compressed, as to leave little or no room for Cancelli. On the contrary, in the middle of the long Bones, as the Os Humeri, the Cavities are so large, as to give to the Bone the appearance of a hollow Cylinder. In some of the largest of the long Bones, as the Os Femoris, their solid sides, near the middle, are re- markably thick, and there the Cancelli are almost im- perceptible ; while, at their extremities, their sides are scarcely thicker than writing-paper, and the Cancelli are so numerous as to occupy the whole space between their sides.

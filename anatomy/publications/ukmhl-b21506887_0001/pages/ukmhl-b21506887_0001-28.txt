S COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. seen in Subjects that die with their Veins full of Blood; and in living Animals, when the Bones are cut across, their Vascularity appears from the Blood which oozes from their divided extremities. The Vascularity of Bone is also shewn, by feeding ^n animal for some time on the Rubia Tinctorum, or Madder-root, after which the Bones are observed to be completely tinged with the colouring matter of the Madder. As a person advances in life, the Blood-vessels of the Bones contract in their diameters, as appears from the Bones of old people having less blood in them than those of a person at an early period of life; from In- jections being thrown into the Vessels of the Bones of old persons with more difficulty than in youth ; from less of the injected matter being received in the former; and from the Bones of old Animals receiving less of the tinging matter of Madder than those of young ones. Comparative View of the Bones. From comparing the Bones of people of different ages, it is found, that there is a constant waste and re- newal of their substance; that the Bones increase in weight as a person advances to maturity ; that they continue nearly of the same weight till old age begins, and then become lighter; that the specific gravity of their solid sides, on the contrary, increases by age; for then they become harder and more compact, but thinner, and have larger Cavities than the Bones of young persons.

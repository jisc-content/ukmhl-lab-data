COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Ba^t II. The Latissimus Dorsi and Pectoralis Major form the Axilla, in which the great Vessels and Nerves, and likewise the Glands lie, which belong to the Arm. Serratus Posticus Inferior, vel LumbO'Costalis. Origin : By the same common Tendon with the La- tissimus Dorsi, from the two inferior Dorsal, and from the three superior Lumbar Vertebrae. Insertion : By four Fleshy Slips, into the same num- ber of inferior Ribs, near their Cartilages. Action : To depress the Ribs into which it is insert- ed, and thereby, during Expiration, to assist in con- tracting the Cavity of the Thorax. Rhomboideus, vel Dorso-scapularis. Origin : Tendinous, from the Spinous Processes of the four or five superior Dorsal, and of the three Infe- rior Cervical Vertebrae, and from the Ligamentum Nuchas; descending obliquely. Insertiofi: Into the whole length of the Base of the Scapula. Action: To draw the Scapula upwards and back- wards. This Muscle is frequently divided by an indistinct Line into two unequal portions: The part arising from the Dorsal Vertebrae, and fixed to the Base of the Sca- pula under the Spine, is commonly called Rhomboides Major, and the other part of the Muscle, Rhomboides Minor.

Part I.] - OF THE BONES. 69 gives form to the Cheek. It affords origin to the Zy- gomatici Major et Minor, to part of the Masseter ilnd Temporalis, and insertion to part of the Aponeurosis Temporalis. In a Foetus, the Bone is fully ossified. OssA Maxillaria Superiora. Their Situation in the fore part of the Upper Jaw, and sides of the Nose. Their Size^ the largest of the Bones of the Upper Jaw, on which account they have got their name. The Nasal, or Angular Process of each, forming a portion of the side of the Nose, and of the inner part of the Orbit, and overlapping the outer edge of the Os Nasi above, while that Bone covers the edge of the Nasal Process below. A Ridge at the under and inner side of the Nasal Process, for supporting part of the Os Spongiosum In- ferius. The Orhitar Plate, facing obliquely outwards, and forming a large share of the under side of the Orbit. The Malar Process, at the outside of the Orbitar Plate, unequal, ragged, and of a triangular shape, where it contributes, with the Os Malae, to form the Prominence of the Cheek. The Tuberosity, or Bulge at the back part of the Bone, which forms the posterior boundary of the Ca- vity called Antrum Maxillare, and gives origin to a portion of the external Pterygoid Muscle. A Depression behind the Malar process, where the under end of the Temporal Muscle plays.

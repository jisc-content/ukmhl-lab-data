m COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Past II. riformis, Gemini, Obturatores Externus et Internus, and Quadratus Femoris, assisted by the Psoas Magnus, Iliacus Internus, and Gluteus Minimus. In the bent state, the Muscles which were formerly the Abductors, now become the Rotators outwards. When the Leg is made the fixed point, the different Muscles which formerly moved the Thigh, now move the Trunk and Pelvis upon the Thigh. The Leg is bent, by the Semitendinosus, Semimem- branosus, Biceps Flexor Cruris, and Popliteus^ assist- ed by the Sartorius, Gracilis, Gastrocnemius Externus, and Plantaris;—extended^ by the Rectus Femoris, Cru- ralis, Vasti Externus et Internus. The Gluteus Maxi- mus, and Tensor Vaginae Femoris, from their connex- ions with the Fascia Lata Femoris, assist a little both in the flexion and extension of the Knee. In the bended state of the Leg, the Semitendinosus, Semimembrano- sus, Gracilis, and Popliteus, perform rotation inwards^ —and the Biceps Flexor Cruris, rotation outwards. MUSCLES SITUATED ON THE LEG AND FOOT, SERVING FOR THE MOTION OF THE FOOT AND TOES. Gastrocnemius Externus, vel Gemellus, vel Bifemo- ro-calcaneus.

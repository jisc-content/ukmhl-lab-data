COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pabt IIL not only by the substances already mentioned, but also by the extremities of Arteries on the inner Surface of the Capsular Ligaments in general, and serves for the lubrication of the Joints ; for which purpose it is well adapted, being remarkably slippery to the touch. Synovia is found to be composed of Water, mixed with a small proportion of Gelatin, Mucilage, Albu- men, and common Salt. LIGAMENTS of the HEAD and TRUNK. Ligaments of the Lower Jaw. The Capsular Ligament on each side, which arises from the whole Margin of the Articular Cavity of the Temporal Bone, and is inserted, first into the edge of the Interarticular Cartilage, formerly taken notice of, and afterwards round the Cervix of the Lower Jaw. This Ligament, like others which belong to Joints of the hinge kind, is thickest and strongest at the sides of the Joint, to confine the lateral motion of the Jaw. By it the Jaw is allowed to move upwards, down- wards, or a little forwards or backwards, or to either side ; and the motions are rendered easier by the inter- vention of the Interarticular Cartilage, which follows the Condyle in its different motions. The Suspensory Ligament of the Stylo-glossus, which is attached by one end to the Styloid Process, and to a Ligament running from that Process to the Os Hyoides, and by the other end to the Angle of the Lower Jaw;â€”

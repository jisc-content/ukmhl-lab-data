Part I.] OF THE BONES. 67 a little Process below, where it assists in covering part of the Lacrymal Sac. The posterior Surface^, the largest of the two, form- ing part of the Orbit; and having the appearance of being a continuation of the Pars Plana of the Eth» moid Bone. The anterior Surface^ for lodging part of the La» crymal Sac and Duct, and perforated by small Holes, through which Fibres pass, to make a firm connexion between the Bone and its investing Membrane. In the anterior Depression, the perforation is made in performing the operation for Fistula Lacrymalis. The inner or Nasal Surface, composed of a Furrow and two irregular convex Surfaces, corresponding with the anterior Ethmoid Cells. The substance of the Bone is the thinnest and most brittle of any in the body, in consequence of which it is frequently met with in an imperfect state. Its Connexion to the Frontal Bone by the Transverse Suture, and to the Os Planum by the Ethmoid Suture. Internally, it is connected with the Ethmoid Cells. The Os Unguis forms the inner and fore part of the Orbit, covers part of the Ethmoid Cells, and receives a share of the Lacrymal Sac. * In a Fcetus, it is fully formed. OssA Malarum, vel Ossa Jugalia. The Situation of each in the outer part of the Cheek The external convex Surface, smooth and of a some- what rhomboid form.

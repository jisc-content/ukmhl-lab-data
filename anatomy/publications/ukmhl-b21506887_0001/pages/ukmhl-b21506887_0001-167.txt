Part I.] OF THE BONES. 145 their connecting Ligaments, their motions here are in- considerable. The Bones of the Metacarpus in general give Origin to the Interossei. The Metacarpal Bone of, the Fore-finger^ commonly the longest of the Bones of the Metacarpus. The Base of the Metacarpal Bone of the Fore- finger, opposed to, and corresponding with, the Os Trapezoides, and partly with the Os Trapezium. The inner part of the Base, forming a Ridge, which is articulated with the Os Magnum, and with the next Metacarpal Bone. The connexion of the Base is so firm, that it has little or no motion. The Metacarpal Bone of the Fore-finger gives In- sertion to the Flexor Carpi Radialis, and Extensor Carpi Radialis Longior. The Metacarpal Bone of the Mid-^finger, commonly the second in length. The Base of the Bone generally slanting inwards and downwards, opposed to the Os Magnum. The outer and back part of the Base projecting, and forming a sort of Process, the external Surface of which is connected with the Ridge of the former Bone. The motion of this Bone little more than that of the former one. It gives Origin to the Adductor Pollicis,â€”and In- sertion to the Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevior. The Metacarpal Bone of the Ringfi^nger, shorter than the former Bone. Its Base, semicircular where it is opposed to the Os Unciforme. VOL. I, K

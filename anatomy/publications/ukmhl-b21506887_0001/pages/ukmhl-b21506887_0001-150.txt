128 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. as a defence to the back of the Thorax, and is fixed in such a manner by the surrounding parts, as to be capable of sustaining Bodies of great weight* It gives Origin to the Supra-spinatus, Infra-spina- tus, Teres Major, Teres Minor, Subscapularis, Biceps" Flexor Cubiti, Omo-hyoideus, Coraco-brachialis, L^ong Head of the Triceps Extensor Cubiti,—and to part of the Deltoides;—Insertion to the Rhomboideus, Pectoralis Minor, Serratus Magnus, Levator Scapulae, —and to part of the Trapezius. In a Foetus, the Base, Acromion, Coracoid Pro- cess, and Head of the Scapula, are Cartilaginous. The three first are afterwards joined as Epiphyses; while the Head, with the Glenoid Cavity, is gradually produced from the Body of the Bone. ARM. The AHM, consisting of a single Bone, the Os Humeri, vel Os Brachii. The Os Humeri, the longest and strongest of the Bones of the Superior Ex:tremity. The Situation of this Bone at the side of the Tho- rax, and under the Scapula. The Ball or Head of the Os Humeri, forming a small segment, or about a third part of a large sphere, covered with Cartilage, and placed obliquely at the upper, inner, and back part of the Body of the Bone, to correspond with the Glenoid Cavity of the Scapula.

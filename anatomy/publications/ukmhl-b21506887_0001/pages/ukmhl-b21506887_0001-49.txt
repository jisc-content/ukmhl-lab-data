Paet I.] QF THE BONES. S9 Upon the fore part of the base of the Cranium the Anterior Lobes of the Brain rest; in the middle of the base are two deep Fossae, for lodging the Lateral Lobesj while the Posterior Lobes and the Cerebellum occupy a still deeper Cavity behind. Along the inner side of the Cranium are many Fur- rows, formed by, and for the reception of, the Blood- vessels of the Dura Mater* Upon the inner Surface of certain Crania, Sinuosi- ties are observed, for lodging luxuriances of the Brain; and here the Cranium is sometimes so thin, as to be ren- dered transparent; the two Tables being then closely compacted, without any Cancelli. In some Crania, Pits are seen of different Figures and sizes, for lodging Granulous Bodies on the Dura Mater, termed Glands of Pacchioni ; or sometimes they are occupied by the meeting of large Veins of the Dura Mater. Here also there is often a want of Can- celli. The Bones of the Cranium are composed of two Tables, which at the upper part are nearly parallel to each other. The two Tables have intermediate Cancelli, termed here Diploe, though nearly of the same nature with the Cancelli in other flat Bones* The External Table of the Cranium is somewhat thicker than the Internal^ which, from its thinness and consequent brittleness, is called Vitrea. The Diploe, or Cancelli, between the Tables, are more regular in the Bones of the upper than of the under part of the Cranium, where, in several of the hard Bones, they are not observable*

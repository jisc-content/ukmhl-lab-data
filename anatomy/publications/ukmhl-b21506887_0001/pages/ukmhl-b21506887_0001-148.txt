126 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. longitudinally, with the large end upperngiost, but so shallow as to receive only a small portion of the Ball of the Os Humeri, the rest of the Ball being contain- ed in the Capsular Ligament. The Spine^ or great Ridge, running across the Dor- sum of the Bone, dividing it into small upper and large under surface, and giving origin to part of the Spinati. The Spl^e, small at its beginning, hollowed and curv- ed latterly by the action of Muscles, and becoming higher and broader in its course forward. A triangular Space, between the root of the Spine and base of the Bone, where part of the Trapezius is fixed. At the under side of the Spine, near its base, a pas- sage for the principal Medullary Vessels ; and in the thicker parts of the Bone numerous other, but smaller passages, which answer the same purpose. The Fossa SuprOr-spinata, or Cavity above the Spine, for the origin of the Supra-spinatus. The Fossa Infra-spinata^ or space under the Spine, for the origin of the Infra-spinatus. The under part only of this space is a real Fossa, the rest of the Bone here being somewhat convex. The Spine becoming broad and flat, and terminating in a point at its anterior extremity, where it is termed Acromion^ extremity, or top of the Shoulder. The under surface of the Acromion hollow^ for the passage of the Spinati, which run to the upper end of the Os Humeri. The Situation of the Acromion over the upper end of the Humerus, which, together with the Ligaments,' contributes, to the protection of the Joint.

ne COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. MUSCLES SITUATED BETWEEN THE RIBS, AND WITHIN THE THORAX. Intercostales Externi. Origin: From the under Edges of each Rib, except- ing the Twelfth. They run obliquely downwards and forwards from the Spine to the joining of the Ribs with their Cartilages, from which, to the Sternum, they are discontinued; that place being occupied by an Apo- neurosis. Insertion : Into the upper Edge of each Rib, imme- diately below that from which they take their respec- tive Origins. Portions of the Intercostales Externi, which arise from the Transverse Processes of the Vertebra?, and terminate in the Ribs immediately below, are termed by Albinus, Levatores Costarum Breviores. Other portions, which arise in the same manner, but pass over one Rib, and terminate in the next below it, are named by the same Author, Levatores Costarum Longiores. Intercostales Interni. Origin: The same with that of the Externi; but they begin at the Sternum, and run downwards and backwards, decussating the former Muscles like the strokes of the letter X, and continuing as far as the

Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. m Angles of the Ribs, from which to the Spine they are wanting. Insertion : In the same manner as the Externi. Portions of the Intercostales Interni, near the under part of the Thorax, which pass over one Rib, and ter- minate in the next below it, are called by Douglas, Costarum Depressores Proprii Cowperi. Action of the Intercostales Interni, as well as of the Externi: To enlarge the Cavity of the Thorax, by elevating the Ribs in the time of Inspiration ; and the obliquity of the one set, balancing that of the other, allows them to be raised more directly upwards. From the obliquity of their Fibres, they are found to possess a greater power in raising the Ribs, than Fibres going in a perpendicular direction. The Intercostales Externi end near the Sternum, and the Interni near the Spine, to admit the ready motion of the Ribs; for, Jiad the former been conti- nued to the Sternum, and the latter to the Spine, the parts of these Muscles supposed to be thus fixed, would of course have become Antagonists to the rest. The portions called Levatores, and Depressores Cos- tarum^ assist in raising the Ribs, in the same manner as the rest of the Intercostales. Sterno-Costalis, vel Triangularis Sterni, Origin : From the Edges of the Cartilage Ensifor- mis, and lower half of the middle Bone of the Ster- num within the Thorax. It runs upwards and out- wards, behind the Cartilages of the Ribs. Insertion : Generally by three Angular Tormina-

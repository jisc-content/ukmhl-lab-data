Part I.] OF THE BONES. 53 terius, or Hole common to the Pars Petrosa and Cunei- form Process of the Occipital Bone, for the passage of the Lateral Sinus, the Eighth, and the Accessory Nerves. The Nerves pass through the fore part of the Hole, and are separated from the Sinus by a Process of the Dura Mater, stretched between two small Processes of these Bones. In some Skulls, an Osseous Partition separates the Nerves from the Sinus. The Squamous part of the Temporal Bone is thin, but equal, while the Pars Petrosa is thick and strong, but irregular, having within it several Cavities, Pro- cesses, and Bones, which belong to the Organ of Hear- ing. The connewion of the Bone, at its upper curved Edge, to the Parietal Bone, by the Squamous Suture. To the under and back part of the Parietal Bone, by the Additamentum Suturae Squamosse. To the Occipital Bone, by the Additamentum Su- turae Lambdoidalis. The Temporal Bone protects the inferior and lateral parts of the Brain, and contains the Internal Organ of Hearing. It gives origin to the Digastricus, Stylo-hydideus, Stylo-glossus, Stylo-pharyngis, Levator Palati, Ante- rior Auris, Retrahentes Aureiri, and Stapedius, to part of the Temporalis and its Aponeurosis, Constrictor Pharyngis Superior, and Masseter; insertion to the Trachelo-mastoideus, and to part of the Sterno-mas- toideus and Splenius. In a Foetus, the Squamous part of the Bone is sepa- rated from the Petrous by a Fissure ; there is no ap-'

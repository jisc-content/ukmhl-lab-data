The Bone is considered by some Authors as being formed of three pieces ; and then the Os Sacrum is said to have six,- The Jirst or uppermost piece by much the largest^ with Shoulders reaching farther out tlian the end of the Os Sacrum. This is regarded by some as a proper dis- tinction between the Os Coccygis and Os Sacrum. From the back part of the Shoulders, two Cornua frequently ascend to join the forked Spinous Processes at the end of the Os Sacrum, and form a passage for the transmission of the last Pair of Spinal Nerves. The three lower Bones of the Os Coccygis becoming gradually smaller, the fourth terminating in a rough point. Cartilage is interposed between the different pieces of this Bone in young Subjects, joining them toge- ther, after the manner of the Vertebrae ; allowing mo- tion upon each other forwards and backwards, but chiefly between the first and second pieces ; and a greater degree of motion there in a Female than in a Male. In advanced life, but earlier in Men than in Women, the pieces grow together so as to admit no motion; but this takes place much later between the first and second than between the other pieces. The Substance, like that of the Os Sacrum, is spon- gy ; but this Bone differs from the Sacrum in having

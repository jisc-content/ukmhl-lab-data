S40 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part III. Mucus, which forms the back part of this Joint, also assisting to fix the two Bones to each other, in such a manner as to allow no motion; the Joint, however, a- long with its fellow, and that between the Ossa Pubis, being useful in diminishing the effects which might result from concussion. The two SacrO'ischiatic Ligaments, situated in the under and back part of the Pelvis. They arise in com- mon from the Transverse Processes of the Os Sacrum, from the under and lateral part of that Bone, and from the upper part of the Os Coccygis. The first of these Ligaments, called the Large Ex- ternal, or Posterior Sacro-ischiatic Ligament, descends obliquely to be fixed to the Tuberosity of the Os Is- chium. The other, called the Small Internal, or An- terior Sacro-ischiatic Ligament, runs transversely to be fixed to the Spinous Process of the Os Ischium. These two Ligaments assist in binding the Bones of the Pelvis, in supporting its contents, and in giving Origin to part of its Muscles. By the External, the Notch of the Ilium is formed into a Hole for the pas- sage of the Pyriform Muscle, the Sciatic Nerve, and the Blood-vessels which belong to the outside of the Pelvis. Between the two Sacro-sciatic Ligaments, an Opening is left for the passage of the Obturator Inter- nus, and the Pudic Vessels and Nerves. The two Membranous Productions which are connect- ed with the large Sacro-ischiatic Ligament, termed by Weitbrecht the Superior and Inferior Appendices of the large Sacro-ischiatic Ligament. The Superior Appendix, which is Tendinous, arises from the back part of the Spine of the Os Ilium, and

108 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The upper part of this portion of the Bone, formed into a ridge by its junction with the Os Ilium. The upper part of the Bone becoming smaller where it is flattened above, and rendered smooth by the pas- sage of the Flexor Muscles of the Thigh, and of the anterior Crural Vessels and Nerves. The upper and inner part of the Bone increasing in size, and forming the rough Crest or Angle^ where the Rectus and Pyramidalis, and the inner end of Pou- part's Ligament, are attached. A Ridge, or Spine, extended from the outer and fore part of the Crest, along the upper and inner edge of the Bone, to form, with a similar Ridge of the Os Ilium, the Linea Ilio-pectinea, Brim, or upper opening of the Pelvis. This Ridge is described by some Authors as being sometimes so sharp, as to injure the parts which lie im- mediately contiguous to it. Another Ridge, from the Crest or Angle, extending downwards and outwards towards the breach in the fore part of the Acetabulum. A Cavity between these Ridges, for the origin of the Pectineus. Immediately below the undermost of the two Ridges, the Bone having a twisted appearance, and a Notch which is formed into a Hole in the Subject, by the addition of the Obturator Ligament, for the passage of the Obturator Vessels and Nerves. The inner end of the Bone rough and unequal, but covered with a Ligamentous Cartilage, which, in fresh Bones, joins the two Ossa Pubis so firmly together, as to prevent them from moving upon each other.

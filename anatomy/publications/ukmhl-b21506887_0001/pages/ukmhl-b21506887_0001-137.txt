Part I.J OF THE BONES. 115 The under Edge, sharp where the Intercostalis Ex- ternus has its origin. A Fossa at the inside of the under Edge, for lodging the Intercostal Vessels and Nerve. The upper Edge of the Fossa gives origin to the Intercostalis Internus. The Fossa wanting towards the extremities of the Ribs; the Vessels not being in contact with them be- hind, and too small to impress them anteriorly. An Oval Pit in the anterior extremity of each Rib, for receiving the Cartilage which runs from it towards the Sternum. The Cartilages of the Ribs, placed between them and the Sternum, or connected to each other, or lying loose among the Muscles. The Cartilages, like the Ribs, Jlat on their outer and inner Surfaces, and smooth wherÂ« they are opposed to the Lungs. The Cartilage of each Rib, forming, with the Rib itself, a Curve^ the concave part outwards; And with the Sternum, an obtuse Angle above, and an acute one below. The Cartilages yield to the motions of the Ribs, and enable them to return to their former position, when the Muscles of inspiration cease to act. The Cartilages of the Ribs, in old people, are frequently ossified. The Ribs are connected behind to the Vertebrae by a double articulation, and before to the Sternum by the Cartilages, or by the Cartilages to each other, in such a manner as to allow motion upwards and downwards, though only a small degree in any single Rib, and that tovv^ards its middle ; but no motion in any other direc^ tion. ,

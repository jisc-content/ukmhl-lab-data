I ^1% COMPENDITJm OF ANATOMY. [Part II. of the four Fingers, by a Tendinous Expansion, which is thick and strong at the sides of the Joints, but thin at their back part to facilitate their motions. Action: To extend all the Joints of the Fingers, and to assist in making them diverge from each other. A Slip of this Muscle going to the Little Finger, is called by some Authors Extensor Proprius Minimi Di~ giti. Supinator Radii Longus, vel Humero-super-radialis. Origin: By an acute Fleshy beginning, from the Ridge of the Os Humeri, above the external Condyle, nearly as high as the middle of the Bone. It forms a thick Fleshy Belly, which covers the upper part of the Extensor Carpi Radialis Longior; and about the middle of the Fore-arm sends a tapering Tendon along the edge of the Radius. Insertion : Into the outer side of the under end of the Radius. Action: To roll the Radius outwards, and, of course, to turn the Palm forwards. Supinator Radii Brevis, vel Epicondilo-radialis. Origin: Tendinous from the external Condyle of the Os Humeri, and Tendinous and Fleshy from the outer and upper part of the Ulna, and from the Inter- osseous Ligament. It passes over the external edge of the Radius. Insertion: Into the upper and back part of the Ra- dius' Action: To assist the Supinator Longus.

Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. 285 A little below the Trochanter Major, it is intimately connected to the Linea Aspera. At the Joint of the Knee it receives additions from the Tendons of the Ex- tensors of the Leg, and is there connected with the outer and inner sides of the Heads of the Tibia and Fi- bula. In the Leg, it is firmly fixed to the Spines or Ridges of these Bones, and at the under end, to those of the Ankle, where part of it, thicker and stronger than the rest, is extended anteriorly from the Malleo- lus Internus and Os Naviculare, to the Malleolus Ex- ternus, and adjacent part of the Os Calcis, to form the Ligamentum Tarsi Annulare. It vanishes at last upon the Foot. It serves the same general purposes with the Aponeu- rosis of the Superior Extremities. Psoas Magnus, see p. 9S% Iliacus Internus, see p. 233. ' Pectinalis, vel Pectineiis, vel Super-pubio^emoralis, Origin : Broad and Fleshy, from the upper and fore part of the Os Pectinis vel Pubis, between the upper part of the Foramen Thyroideum and Brim of the Pel- vis. It runs downwards and outwards at the inner side of the Psoas Magnus. Insertion; By a flat and short Tendon, into the Linea Aspera of the Os Femoris, a little below the Trochanter Minor. Action: To pull the Thigh upwards and inwards, and to give it, and of course the Foot, a degree of ro- tation outwards.

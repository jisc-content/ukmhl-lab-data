Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS. circumference of the Joint; but, where the Joint is of the nature of a Hinge, the Ligaments are strongest at the sides of that Hinge, or are there strengthened by the addition of Ligamentous Slips, termed Lateral Li- gaments, which assist in regulating the motion of the Joints. The outer part of the Capsular Ligament is formed of a continuation of the Periosteum, which is connected ~ to the surrounding parts by Cellular Substance; while the inner Layer,—remarkably thick and dense,—is re- flected over the Bones and Cartilages which the Liga- ment includes; one part of it thus forming Periosteum^ and the other Perichondrium. In certain parts of the Body, besides the Ligaments mentioned above, there are others for the firm con- nexion of the Bones, or for confining the motion to one particular side ; as the Round Ligament of the Thigh, or Crucial or Lateral Ligaments of the Knee. Wherever the Ligaments are few, long, and weak, the motions are more extensive ; and, on the contrary, where the Ligaments are numerous, short, and strong, the motions are more limited. Ligaments have numerous Blood-vessels, which can be readily injected. Upon the inner Surface of the Capsular Ligaments, their Arteries secrete a Liquor which assists in the lu- brication of the Joints. The Nerves of Ligaments are very minute, but in some parts can be easily traced upon their Surface. The Sensibility of Ligaments, in the sound state, is inconsiderable ; when in a state of inflammation, how- ever, they are found to occasion extreme pain.

M8 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paet III. Ligaments between the Bodies^ and between the Under Ends, of the Radius and Ulna. The Interosseous Ligament, which extends between the sharp Ridges of the Radius and Ulna, filling up the greater part of the space between the two Bones. It is broadest in the middle, in consequence of these Bones being largest at their extremities, and is composed of small Fasciculi, which run obliquely downwards and inwards. Two or three of these Slips, however, go in the opposite direction; and one of them, termed Oblique Ligament, and Chorda Transversalis Cubiti, is stretched between the Tubercle of the Ulna and under part of the Tubercle of the Radius. In different parts of the Interosseous Ligament, there are Perforations for the passage of Blood-vessels from the fore to the back part of the Fore-arm, and a large Opening is found at the upper edge of it, which is occupied by Muscles. This Ligament assists in binding the Ulna and Ra- dius together, prevents the Radius from rolling too much outwards, and furnishes a commodious~attach- ment for Muscles. The Capsular, or Sacciform Ligament, which arises from the edges of the Semilunar Cavity at the under end of the Radius, and surrounds the Head of the Ulna, allowing the Radius to turn upon the Ulna, in performing the different motions of the Pronation and Supination of the Hand.

Part I.] OF THE BONES. 95 rendered convex there, for the support of the Abdomi- nal Bowels. The Oblique Processes^ remarkably deep, and placed upright, the Superior Oblique Processes of one Verte- bra facing inwards, and receiving the Inferior Oblique Processes of the Vertebra above it, which are turned in the opposite direction. The Transverse Processes, long, slender, and spread out from the Bone, to give origin to large Muscles, and to admit free motion. The Spinous Processes, short, large, snd strong, and placed horizontally, with narrow edges above and be- low, and broad flat sides, giving origin to Muscles of great strength. The Spinal Canal, larger than in the back, for the passage of the Cords of the Spinal Marrow, which form the Cauda Equina. In consequence of the thickness of the Intervertebral Substances, and the situation of the Processes of the Lumbar Vertebrae, the motion of this part of the Spine is extensive, though not so much so as in the Neck. The true Vertebrae give an erect posture to the Trunk of the Body ; allow a sufficient and secure mo- tion to the Head, Neck, and Trunk ; conduct the Spi- nal Marrow; support and protect the Bowels, and other soft parts ; and on each side give Origin to the Longus Colli, Recti Capitis Anteriores Major et Minor, Rectus Capitis Lateralis, Lesser Muscle of the Diaphragm, Psoae Magnus et Parvus, Rhomboideus, Splenius, Ser- rati Postici Superior et Inferior, Spinalis Dorsi, Com- plexus, Trachelo-mastoideus, Levator Scapulae, Semi- spinalis Dorsi, Semi-spinalis Colli, Transversalis Colli,

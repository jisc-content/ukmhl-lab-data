Part L] OF THE BONES. ( 11 The Bellies of the Muscles being generally placed upon the middle of the Bones, and the Tendons fixed to their extremities, the symmetry of the limbs is also thereby preserved. . ; Periosteum. ; ji^WhB Periosteum derives its name from its furnish- ing a general covering to the Bones. In certain parts, however, it imperforated by Muscles, Ligaments, or Cartilages, which are fixed immediately to the surface of the Bones ; and at the Joints it sepa- rates from the Bones, to give a covering to the Capsu- lar Ligaments. It is formed of many Fibres, which, in certain parts, can be divided into Layers. The outer Surface of this Membrane is connected to the surrounding parts by Cellular Substance. "Yh^Q inner Surface is more uniform than the outer, and its Fibres run, most frequently, in the same direc- tion with those of the subjacent Bone. The inner part of the Periosteum is intimately con- nected to the surface of the Bones by short Fibres; and this connexion is much stronger in Children than in Adults. Some of these Fibres may be considered as Ligamentous, but most of them are found by Injec- tion to consist of Blood-vessels. The Periosteum, as well as other Membranes, must be supplied with Nerves but these are too minute to be readily traced. The Sensibility of the Periosteum, like thiit of other

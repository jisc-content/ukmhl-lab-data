90 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paki I. Peculiarities of the True Vertebra. The Vertebrae, on account of certain peculiarities, divided into Cervical, Dorsal, and Lumbar. The Cervical Vertehrce, or VertehrcB of the NecTc, commonly seven, in some very rare cases only six ; or, on the contrary, eight in number ; having their Bodies smaller than those of the other Vertebrae. The Bodies of the Cervical Vertebrae flattened ante- riorly, for the passage of the Esophagus, and for the attachment of the Longi Colli and Recti Majores; and flattened also posteriorly, corresponding with the breadth of the Spinal Marrow. The Bodies of these Vertebrae mutually embracing each other, the under and fore part of each overlapping, in a small degree, the upper and fore part of the Ver- tebra immediately below, while the lateral parts of the in- ferior Vertebra overlap the sides of that directly above it. The Articulating Processes more oblique than the rest. The Transverse Processes perforated for the passage of the Vertebral Blood-vessels, and hollowed above for the transmission of the Spinal Nerves. The Spinal Processes, placed horizontally, shorter than the rest, and Jhrhed for the attachment of the Musculi Inter-spinales. The Cervical Vertebrae admit of Jree motion, in con- sequence of the thickness of their Cartilages, and the nature of their Processes, but give less protection be- hind to the Spinal Marrow than is given in other parts

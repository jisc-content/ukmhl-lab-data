Part I.] OF THE BONES. 85 of decorticated Barley, placed at the upper part of the Articulation between the Body and Cornua, for the attachment of the Muscles. From each Appendix, a Ligament is sent up to the Styloid Process of the Temporal Bone, to assist in connecting the Os Hyoides to the Cranium. The substance of this Bone is Cellular, but covered with a firm external Plate, which adds considerably to its strength. The Os Hyoides is not immediately connected to any other Bone, but is kept in its place by numerous Muscles and Ligaments to be afterwards described. The Os Hyoides serves as a Lever for numerous Muscles acting upon the Tongue, Larynx, and Fauces. It gives origin to the Hyo-glossus, and to part of the Constrictor Pharyngis Medius ; insertion to the Ster- no-hyoideus, Omo-hyoideus, Stylo-hyoideus, Genio- hyoideus, Thyro-hyoideus, to part of the Genio-hyo- glossus, Digastricus, and Mylo-hyoideus. At Birth, the greater part of the Bone is in a Carti- laginous state, and the Appendices continue so for many years after the other parts are completely ossified. In a young Adult, the five pieces of which this Bone is composed may be separated by putrefaction, in consequence of which Soemmerring describes them as so many distinct Bones.

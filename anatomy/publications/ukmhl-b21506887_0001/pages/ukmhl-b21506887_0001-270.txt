210 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pakt II. The two last-mentioned Muscles are obscurely seen, excepting in robust Bodies. By the Crico-arytenoidei Postici, and Arytenoidei Transversus et Obliqui, the Glottis is made longer^ its Ligaments rendered tense and brought together, as in forming acute sounds.^^y the Crico-arytenoidei Laterales, and Thyro-arytenoidei, the Glottis is open- ed^ its Ligaments sJiortened and relaxed^ as in forming grave sounds,-â€”By the Thyro-epiglottidei, and Ary- teno-epiglottidei, assisted by the pressure of the Root of the Tongue, the Epiglottis is made to cover and completely shut up the Glottis, in the time of Swal- lowing ; after Deglutition, the Epiglottis rises again by its own elasticity, the Tongue at the same time be- ing carried forwards. MUSCLES situated on the ANTEHIOR and LATERAL PARTS of the ABDOMEN. Previous to the description of the Abdominal Mus- cles, it is proper to take notice of certain Expansions or Fasciae covering the first of these. Over the Tendon of the Muscle called External Ob- lique, there is a thin Expansion, termed Superficial Fascia^ consisting chiefly of Transverse Fibres. This can also be traced down upon the fore part of the Thigh. It adheres to the whole length of the Crural Arch, and part of it is fixed to Ligaments about the root of the Penis and Clitoris. It sends also a Sheath

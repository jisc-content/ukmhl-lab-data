162 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The upper part of the Astragalus, formed into a large Head, resembling a Pulley, which is smooth on its up- per part and sides, to be articulated with the under end of the Leg-bones. Each of the Cartilaginous Surfaces of the Head of this Bone, depressed in its middle, to correspond with the parts of the Leg-bones with which it is articulated. Round the inferior edge of the articulating Surfaces, a rough Fossa for the insertion of the Capsular Liga- ment ; and at the sides of this Surface, the Bone mark- ed by the lateral Ligaments. The under part of the Bone, consisting of a deep Fossa, or sinuous Cavity, which divides it into an an- terior and posterior articulating surface. The Fossa in the under Surface, narrower at the inner part of the Bone, and becoming gradually wider as it goes outwards and forwards. The posterior articulating Surface, large and concave for its articulation with the upper and middle part of the Os Calcis. ^^jm^ym^ The anterior articulating Surface, irregular and Con- 'vex, where it plays upon two smooth Cavities at the inner and fore part of the Os Calcis, and upon a Car- tilaginous Ligament extended between the Os Calcis and Os Naviculare. - v.iio^ ij^maoo noiifiifjadUi lo aJ'f;^;. A large oblong smooth Head, at the fore part of the Bone, for its articulation with the Os Nayiculare. The Joint between the Astragalus and Leg-bones forms a complete Hinge, which, together with the above- mentioned Ligaments, allows the Foot to bend and ex- tend jipon the Leg, but admits of no lateral; nor rota- .'<'iT . _ : .... .,k. iij^-io J ri.

34 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. bits and root of the Nose, between the Frontal, Malar, Sphenoid, Ethmoid, Superior Maxillary, and Nasal Bones. The Zygomatic Sutures, placed between the Zygo- matic parts of the Temporal and Cheek Bones^ and slanting obliquely downwards and backwards. The advantages derived from the Cranium being formed of different Bones and Sutures are, that the Spheroidal figure is sooner completed;—that the Bones, which are at some distance from each other at Birth, yield, and conduce to an easier Delivery;—that the Dura Mater, by the Sutures, has a firmer adhesion;— and that Fractures are frequently prevented from ex- tending so far as they would do in one continued bony Substance ; which last circumstance takes place in ex- treme old age. OF THE SEPARATE BONES OF THE HEAD. Os Frontts. The principal things to be attended to in this Bone, are. The Situation of the Os Frontis in the fore part of the Cranium. Its Shape, which has been compared to that of a Clam-shell, or to the Concha Bivalvis, or Cockle.

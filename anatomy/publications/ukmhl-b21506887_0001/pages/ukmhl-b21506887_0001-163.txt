Part I ] OF THE BONES. 141 face of the Os Cuneiforme, forming a Prominence which is readily felt in the Wrist, and which gives attachment to strong Tendons and Ligaments, particularly to part of the Ligamentum Carpi Annulare. The Os Pisiforme gives Origin to part of the Ab- ductor Minimi Digiti,—and Insertion to the Flexor Ulnaris, and to part of the Pal maris Brevis. The Os Trapezium, named from the four unequal Edges of its posterior Surface. The Situation of this Bone, at the Root of the Me- tacarpal Bone of the Thumb. The upper part of the Bone, forming a smooth Pit, to be articulated with the Os Scaphoides. The inner side, hollow, and articulated with the Os Trapezoides. The under Surface, forming a Pulley, on which the Metacarpal Bone of the Thumb moves. The anterior Surface, sending out a Process, which is prominent in the Palm, and marked by the Trans- verse Ligament of the Wrist, by the Flexor Carpi Ra- dialis, and Flexors of the Thumb. The Os Trapezium gives Origin to part of the Op- ponens et Abductor Pollicis, Abductor Indicis,—and Insertion to the Extensor Ossis Metacarpi Pollicis. The Os Trapezoides, so named from its being some- what like the former Bone, though considerably smaller. The Situation of the Os Trapezoides, at the inner side of the Os Trapezium. The upper Surface, hollow where it joins tlie Sca- phoides.

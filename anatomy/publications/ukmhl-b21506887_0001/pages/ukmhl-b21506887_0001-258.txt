198 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. i Action : To depress the Os Hyoides, and pull it to 1 one side; or, when both Muscles act, to draw it direct- ly downwards. j MUSCLES SITUATED BETWEEN THE LOWER JAW \ AND OS HYOIDES. 1 J ;i ;i DiGASTRICUS, I Vel Bive7iter MaooillcB Iriferioris^ vel Mastoido-mentalis. . Origin : By a Fleshy Belly, from the Groove at the j Root of the Mastoid Process of the Temporal Bone. | It runs downwards and forwards, and forms a strong j round Tendon, which passes through the Stylo-hyoi- ' deus; it is then fixed by a Ligament to the Os Hyoides, i and, having received an addition of Tendinous and \ Muscular Fibres from that Bone, it runs obliquely < upwards and forwards, forming another Fleshy Belly. Insertion: Into a rough Sinuosity at the under part ' of the Symphysis of the Lower Jaw. ] Action : To open the Mouth, by pulling the Lower i Jaw downwards and backwards ; and when the Jaws ) are shut, to raise the Os Hyoides, and of course the j Throat,â€”as in swallowing. When^the Lower Jaw is j fixed, this Muscle, according to Soemmeriiing, can 1 extend the Head, and thereby open the Mouth, by ele- i vating the Upper Jaw. This he thinks he has ob- j served in a child sucking. \

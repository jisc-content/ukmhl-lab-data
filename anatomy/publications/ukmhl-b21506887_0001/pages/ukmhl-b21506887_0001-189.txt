Part I.] OF THE BONES. 167 The Os NavicularOssa Cuneiformia, and Os Cn- boidesy are almost Cartilaginous at Birth. Metatabsus. The Metatarsus, or Bones beyond the Tarsus, com- posed of Jive pieces, which answer to the general cha- racters given to the Metacarpal Bones. Their Bodies long, arched upwards, and tapering towards their anterior Extremities. The Extremities, large in proportion to their Bodies, and the posterior much larger than the anterior. The Bases, or posterior Extremities, Jlat, or a very little Jiollowed, to be articulated with the fore part of the Tarsal Bones. From the flatness of their Bases, and the strength of the Ligaments which fix these Bones to those of the Tarsus, very little motion is allowed to this part of the Foot. Round the Bases, rough Surfaces for the attachment of Ligaments. The sides of the Bases, Jlat where they are articu- lated with each other. A Ridge above, and a Jlat Surface at each side of their Bodies, for the Origin of the Interossei. The Jlat Surfaces turned obliquely outwards, and the obliquity increasing the more externally the Bones are placed. The anterior Extremities forming Balls, to be arti- culated with the Toes;—the Balls much longer from above downwards, than from one side to the other. ^> • I

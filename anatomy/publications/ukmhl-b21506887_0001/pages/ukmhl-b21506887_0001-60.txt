40 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paet I. The Corners of the Bone obtuse^ excepting the infe- rior-anterior, which forms a kind of Process. The Corners or Angles of the Bone are named Fron- tal, Sphenoidal, Occipital, and Mastoid, according to their situations. The external Surface of the Bone convex and smooth^ having no Muscles but the Temporal fixed to it. The Transverse arched Ridge, or Line, frequently of a whiter colour than the rest of the Bone, placed externally a little below its middle height, for the ori- gin of the Temporal Muscle. The radiated Furrows at the under part of the Bone, formed by the Fibres of the Temporal Muscle. Near the inferior or semicircular edge, many inequa- lities, which join similar inequalities on the inside of the Temporal Bone, to form the Squamous Suture. The Foramen Parietale, near the upper and back part of the Bone, for the transmission of a Vein, which passes obliquely from the Integuments of the Head to the superior longitudinal Sinus; and sometimes of a small Branch from the Temporal or the Occipital Ar- tery, to the Falx of the Dura Mater. In several Skulls, one of the Parietal Holes is want- ing ; in some, two are found in one side; in others, none in either. The internal concave surface of the Bon^. The Furrows made by the blood-vessels of the Dura Mater ; the principal of which begin by a trunk, term- ed Meningea Media, at the under and fore part of the Bone, where frequently a real Canal is formed, which ought to be attended to by Surgeons in the operation of the Trepan over this part.

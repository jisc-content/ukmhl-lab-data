Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. m the passage is oblique, and is about an inch in length. It has also a quantity of Cellular Substance, which is considered by some Authors as forming a distinct Ca- nal under the name of Abdominal or Inguinal. The Cellular Substance surrounds the Cord, or the round Ligament, and assists these in complet^y filling the whole of this passage. Rectus, vel PuMo-sternalis, vel Sterno-PuhiaUs. Origin : Tendinous from the fore and upper part of the Symphysis Pubis. It soon becomes Fleshy, and runs upwards in form of a flat Band, the whole length of, and parallel to, the Linea Alba. Between its up- per Extremity and the Umbilicus, it is divided in- to three nearly equal portions, by as many transverse Tendinous Intersections, and there is generally a half Intersection some way below the Umbilicus. These seldom penetrate through the whole thickness of its Substance. They adhere firmly to the anterior part of the Sheath which incloses the Muscle, so as to ren- der its separation difficult, but slightly to the poste- rior Layer. Insertion : Into the Cartilages of the three inferior True Ribs, and extremity of the Sternum. It frequent-- ly intermixes with the under edge of the Pectoralis Major. Action: To compress the fore part of the Abdomen ; to draw down the Ribs in Expiration; and to bend the Body forwards, or to raise the Pelvis. By means of its Sheath and Tendinous intersections, it is kept in its. place, and allowed to act more equally.

The Capsular Ligament^ which arises from the Carti- laginous Edge of the upper Row of the Carpus, and is fixed in a similar manner to that of the under Row, chiefly admitting of flexion and extension, and that in a smaller degree than in the former Joint. The SJiort Ligaments of the Bones of the Carpus, which are small Slips running in various directions, joining the diffierent bones of the Carpus,â€”first of the same Row, then of the two Rows together. They are termed Oblique^ Transverse, Capsular, and Proper Li- gaments of the Wrist, and admit only of a small de- gi^ee of yielding between the diff*erent Bones in the same Row. Ligaments between the Carpal and Metacarpal Bones. The Articular Ligajnents, which arise from the Mar- gin of the second Row of the Carpal Bones, and are fixed to the Margins of the adjoining Bones of the Me- tacarpus. Other Ligaments run in a radiated manner from the Carpal to the Metacarpal Bones; the whole getting the names of Articular, Lateral, Straight, Per- pendicular, &c. according to their different directions. From the flatness of the Articular Surfaces, and streiigth of the connecting Ligaments, very little mo- tion is allowed between the Carpus and Metacarpus.

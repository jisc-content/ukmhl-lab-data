158 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. one at the outer part of the Tibia, for the insertion of the Interosseous Ligament. A Canal on the back part of the Bone, slanting ob- liquely downwards, a little above its middle, for the passage of the Medullary Vessels. ^ The under End of the Fibula, broad and Jlaty to be received by the Semilunar Cavity of the Tibia. The under end of the Bone forming the Malleolus Externus^ or outer Ankle, which is larger, longer, lower, and farther back than the inner Ankle, the ob- liquity of the two Malleoli in some measure corre- sponding with the obliquity of the Foot. A convex smooth Surface on the inner side of the Malleolus Externus, opposed to the outer side of the Astragalus, which moves upon it. The Coronoid Process, sent down from the Malleo- lus Externus, from which Ligaments go to the Bones at the outer side of the Foot. A Furrow upon the back of the Malleolus Exter- nus, for lodging part of the Tendons of the Peronei. The Substance of the Fibula is like that in other long Bones. The Fibula being articulated with the Tibia at its superior extremity by almost plain surfaces, and tied to it by strong and short Ligaments, only a very little motion is allowed. At the under end it is joined so firmly by strong Li- gaments, that no sensible motion appears in the Sub- ject ; though in this Joint, as in several others, where the Bones are firmly fixed by short Ligaments, there may be an elastic yielding in the living Body. In old people, these two Bones aire not unfrequently

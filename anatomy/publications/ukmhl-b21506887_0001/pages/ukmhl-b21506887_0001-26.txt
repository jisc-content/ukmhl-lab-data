6 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The Cancelli of Bones are formed by flie internal Plates passing inwards, and decussating each other; and in the long Bones, their sides, in consequence of sending off the Cancelli, become gradually thinner to- wards their extremities, while the Cancelli in propor- tion become more numerous. The thinness of the Tables of the Bones near their extremities, is not in proportion to the increase of dia- meter, but to the quantity of Cellular Matter sent in- wards. That the Tables at the middle of the long Bones form not only the Tables at the extremities, but also the Cancelli; and that the same quantity of Osseous Mat- ter exists at the middle as at the ends of these Bones, is proved by sawing a Bone across into portions of equal lengths, when it is found that the weight of each of the pieces is nearly the same. The Cancelli, though extremely minute, can be seen even in the most solid parts of Bones. Some run in a longitudinal, and others in a transverse direction com- municating with the longitudinal, and becoming gra- dually smaller in their passage from the internal Ca- vity towards the outer Table of the Bones.â€”This may be observed by exposure to heatj or in Bones enlarged by disease. These Cells are distinguishable from the Canals for containing the Vessels, the former being ir- regular, and the latter cylindrical. The Cancelli support the Membranes containing the Marrow, as the Cellular Substance does the Fat, and prevent one part of the column of Marrow from gravi- tating upon another, in the various positions of the

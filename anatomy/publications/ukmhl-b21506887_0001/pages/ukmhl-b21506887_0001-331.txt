Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. LuMBRiCALEs, vel Pdlmo-pholangei. These consist of four small Muscles somewhat re- sembling Earth-worms, from which they derive their name. Origin : Thin and fleshy, from the outside of the Tendons of the Flexor Profundus, a little above the lower edge of the Ligamentum Carpi Annulare. At the under ends of the Metacarpal Bones, each sends off a slender Tendon. Insertion: Into the outer sides of the broad Ten- dons of the Interossei Muscles, about the middle of the first Phalanx. Action : To bend the first Phalanx, and increase the Flexion of the Fingers, while the long Flexors are in full action, and to assist the Radial Interossei in draw- ing the Fingers outwards. Extensor Digitorum Communis, Vel Epicondilo-super-phcLlangeus Communis. Origin : Tendinous and Fleshy, from the external Condyle of the Os Humeri, where it adheres to the Su- pinator Radii Brevis. It passes down upon the back part of the Fore-arm, and before it goes under the Li- gamentum Carpi Annulare Posterius, it splits into three or Four Tendons, some of which may be subdivided. Upon the back of the Metacarpal Bones, the Tendons become broad and flat, and, near the Heads of these Bones, send Aponeurotic Expansions to each other.

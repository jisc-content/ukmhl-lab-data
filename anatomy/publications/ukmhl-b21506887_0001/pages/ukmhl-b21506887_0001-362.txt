S09. COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paet II. Peroneus Longus, Vel Primus, vel Peroneo-suh-tarseus. Origin : Tendinous and Fleshy, from the fore part of the Head of the Fibula; and Fleshy, from the outer part of that Bone, down to within a hand-breadth of the Ankle. The Fibres run in a penniform manner towards a long Tendon, which becomes round, and, in- closed in a Sheath, passes through a channel behind the Malleolus Externus. It is then reflected to the Sinuosity of the Os Calcis, runs along a Oroove in the Os Cuboides, and goes obliquely across the Bones in the middle of the Sole. Insertion: Tendinous, into the outside of the root of the Metatarsal Bone of the Great Toe, and partly into the Os Cuneiforme Internum. Action: To extend the Foot a little, to draw it out- Wards, and to turn the inner edge of it downwards. Peroneus Brevis, Vel Secundus, vel Peroneo-metatarseus Magnus. Origin : Fleshy, from the outer part of the Fibula, beginning some way above the middle height of the Bone, and continuing its adhesion as far as the Malleo- lus Externus. The Fibres run, like those of the former Muscle, to an external Tendon, which becomes round, passes behind the outer Ankle, where it is included in the same Sheath with the Tendon of the preceding

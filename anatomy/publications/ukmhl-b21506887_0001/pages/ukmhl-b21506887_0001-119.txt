The under and Jhre part forming a turn^ called by some the Lesser Angle of the Bone, and which varies much in different Subjects. The convex irregular Surface behind, where strong Muscles arise, which assist in extending the Spine and Thigh. Four transverse prominent Lines seen anteriorly, in- dicating the situation of the Cartilages which original- ly divided the Bone into five pieces. The upper part of the Body of the first portion of the Os Sacrum, similar to that of the Vertebrae of the Loins, while the fifth portion corresponds with the first piece of the Os Coccygis. The Spinal Canal, of a triangular form, of great size above, but becoming gradually smaller in its descent; corresponding to the size of the under end of the Spinal Marrow, termed Cauda Equina, which goes through it. The under part of the Spinal passage, commonly qpm behind; the Canal being completed, in the Subject, by the addition of a strong Ligamentous Membrane. - Sometimes the Canal is open through the whole length of the'Os Sacrum. The Arch at the sides and back part of the Spinal Canal, much thicker and stronger than in the True Vertebrae. The Oblique Processes, excepting the two uppermost, all united together, and confounded with the Trans- verse Processes. The two Superior Oblique Processes belonging to this VOL. I. G

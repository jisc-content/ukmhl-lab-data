Paet I.J OF THE BONES. ^ 51 The Foramen Mastoideum, occasionally found at the ^ back part of the Mastoid Process, oi in the Lambdoid Suture. When present, it sometimes transmits an Ar- tery to the Dura Mater, but more commonly a Vein from the Integuments of the Head to the Lateral Sinus. Sometimes two or three Foramina Mastoidea are ob- served, serving the same purpose with that already no- ticed ; but these, like all the other passages for Veins leading into the Sinuses, are very uncertain. The upper and mner Edge of the Squamous Plate, formed into Ridges and Furrows, where it is connected with the Parietal Bone, and the fore part of this Plate irregular, where it joins the Sphenoid Bone. The inner Surface of the Squamous Plate, unequal where it is marked by the Convolutions of the middle part of the Brain, and by the Arteries of the Dura Mater. The Pars Petrosa, vel Pyramis Trigona, as seen within the Cranium, of great size, running forwards and inwards, with a sharp angle above, which divides the Bone into two flat sides ; one facing obliquely for- wards and outwards, and the other as much backwards and inwards. T\\e anterior and outer Surface of the Pars Petrosa opposed to the lateral Lobe of the Brain. The posterior and inner Surface of the Pars Petrosa opposed to the Cerebellum. The Ridge or Angle between the two Surfaces of the Pars Petrosa, for the attachment of the Tentorium Durae Matris. A Groove frequently found upon the Ridge of the Pars Petrosa, for lodging the superior Petrosal Sinus. D 2

58 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. Processes are compared to the wings, though more properly resembling the feet of the Bat. Each is com- posed of two Plates. The External Plate^ broad and hollow without, where the External Pterygoid Muscle has its origin. Be- tween the root of this Plate and that of the Temporal one, a large Depression, where the principal part of the External Pterygoid Muscle arises. Before this is another Depression, forming part of the opening com- mon to the Sphenoid, Malar, and Superior Maxillary Bones. The Internal Plate^ narrower and longer than the External, and with its fellow on the opposite side, forming the back part of the Nose. A hooh-like Process upon the Internal Plate, over which the Circumflex us Palati moves as on a Pulley. The Fossa Pterygoidea, facing backwards between the Pterygoid Plates, giving rise to the internal Ptery- goid Muscle. A small Depression behind the root of the internal Pterygoid Plate, which gives origin to part of the Cir- cumflex Muscle of the Palate. A Groove on each side, which extends at the inner part of the Bone, between the root of the Styloid Pro- cess and that of the internal Pterygoid Plate, assisting in the formation of the Eustachian Tube. The two Triangular Processes, which adhere to the under part of the Sphenoid, and to the Ethmoid Bone, and which are considered as two of the Bones of the Face. The Processus Azygos, standing single, and forming ^ sharp ridge, which projects from under the middle

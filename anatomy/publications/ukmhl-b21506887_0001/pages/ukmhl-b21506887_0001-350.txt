290 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. Action: To assist in the abduction of the Thigh, and in its rotation outwards. Gemini, vel Gemelli, vel Ischio-trochantereus. Origin: By two distinct Heads ; the superior from the Spinous Process, and the inferior from the Tube- rosity of the Os Ischium, and from the Sacro-sciatic Ligament. The two Heads are united by a Tendi- nous and Fleshy Membrane, and form a Sheath for the reception of the Tendon of the Obturator Internus. Insertion: Tendinous and Fleshy, into the Cavity at the inner side of the root of the Trochanter Major, on each side of the Tendon of the Obturator Internus, to which they firmly adhere. Action : To roll the Thigh outwards, and to prevent the Tendon of the Obturator Internus from starting out of its place while the Muscle is in action. Obturator Internus, Vel Marsupialis, vel Sub-pubio-trochantereus Internus. Origin : Within the Pelvis, by a semicircular Fleshy Margin, from the anterior half of the Foramen Thy- roideum, and, in part, from the Obturator Ligament. Its Fibres converge, and send off a round Tendon, which passes over the Os Ischium, between the Spine and Tuber of that Bone, as a rope passes over a pulley. ^Where it goes over the Capsular Ligament of the Thigh-bone, it is inclosed in the Sheath of the Gemini. Insertion : By a round Tendon, along with the Ge-

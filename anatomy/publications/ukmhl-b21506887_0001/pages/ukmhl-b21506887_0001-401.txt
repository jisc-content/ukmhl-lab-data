Paet III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS. 3^1 is fixed along the outer edge of the Ligament, which it increases in breadth. The Inferior or Falciform Appendix is situated with- in the Cavity of the Pelvis ; the back part of it is con- nected with the middle of the large External Ligament, and the remainder is extended round the Curvature of the Os Ischium. These two Productions assist the large Sacro-ischia- tic Ligament in furnishing a more commodious situa- tion for, and attachment to, part of the Gluteus Maxi- mus and Obturator Internus. Besides the Ilio-sacral, and Sacro-ischiatic Liga- ments, several other Slips are observed upon the back of the Os Sacrum, which descend in an irregular man- ner, and strengthen the connexion between that Bone and the Ossa Ilia. The large Holes upon the back part of the Os Sa- crum are also surrounded with various Ligamentous Expansions projecting from one Tubercle to another, and giving Origin to Muscular Fibres, and protection to small Vessels and Nerves which creep under them. A General Covering sent down frx^m the Ligaments of the Os Sacrum, which spreads over and connects the different pieces of the Os Coccygis together, allowing considerable motion, as already mentioned in the de- scription of this Bone. Longitudinal Ligaments of the Os Coccygis, which descend from those of the Dorsum of the Os Sacrum, to be fixed to the back part of the Os Coccygis. The Ligaments of this Bone prevent it from being pulled too much forwards, by the action of the Coccygeug ;

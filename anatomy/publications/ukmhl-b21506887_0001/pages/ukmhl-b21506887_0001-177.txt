Part I.] OF THE BONES. 155 the insertion of the anterior and posterior Crucial Li- gaments. The articulating Surfaces at the upper end of the Ti- bia, are rendered deeper in a Subject by ths addition of two semilunar Cartilages placed upon their edge. The circumference of the Head of the Bone, rough and porous^ for the insertion of the Capsular Ligament. A Tubercle at the upper and fore part of the Bone, for the insertion of the lower Tendon or Ligament of the Patella. A Cartilaginous Surface under the outer Edge of the Head of the Bone, for the articulation with the up- per end of the Fibula. The Body of the Bone of a triangular form^ with the sharpest Angle placed anteriorly. The anterior Angle^ called Spine, or SMn^ a little waved, and extending from the Tubercle to the inner Ankle. The anterior and inner Surface of the Bone, smooth, being covered with skin only. The internal Angle, for the attachment of part of the Aponeurosis of the Leg. The anterior and outer Surface, hollowed by the Ti- bialis Anticus, and by the long Extensors of the Toes. The external Angle, or that at the outer and bach part of the Bone, giving attachment to the Interosseous Li- gament. The middle of the posterior Surface, also hollowed by Muscles which assist in extending the foot, and in bending the Toes. A Ridge extending obliquely downwards from the upper and outer part of the Bone, posteriorly, to its in-

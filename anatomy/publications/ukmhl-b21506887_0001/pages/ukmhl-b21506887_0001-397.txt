Paet III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS. 887 Vertebrae and Intervertebral Cartilages, The outer part of each Ligament sends off, or is connected with, radiated Fibres which are spread out upon the sides of the Vertebrae. The Capsular Ligaments of the Tubercles oftheMihs, which arise round the Articular Pits on the points of the Transverse Processes of the Vertebrae of the Back, and are fixed round the Tubercles of the Ribs. The Internal Ligaments of the bach of the Ribs, call- ed Ligamenta Transversaria Interna^ which arise from the inferior Surfaces of the Transverse Processes, and are fixed to the superior Margins of the Necks of the nearest Ribs. The External Ligaments of the Necks of the Ribs, called Ligamenta Transversaria Externa. They arise from the points of the Transverse Processes externally, and are fixed to the back part of the Neck of the Ribs. Ligamenta Cervicis Costarum Externa, or External Ligaments of the Necks of the Ribs, which arise from the external Margin of the inferior oblique Processes, and descend obliquely outwards, to be fixed to the upper and outer part of the Necks of all the Ribs. The Ligaments at this end of the Ribs, together with the situation of the Transverse Processes, admit of their motion upwards and downwards, but prevent them from moving in any other direction. Short Ligamentous Fibres^ which run from the Mar- gins of the anterior extremities of the Ribs to the Mar- gins of their corresponding Cartilages ; the Cartilages and Ribs, which these Fibres inclose, being joined by a union of Substance. Radiated Ligaments, which go from the Sternal ex- VOL. I. Y

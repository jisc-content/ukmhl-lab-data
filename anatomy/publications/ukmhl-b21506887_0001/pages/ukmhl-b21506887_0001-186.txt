164 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. near its fore part, where the Tendon of the Peroneus Longus runs, in its way to the Sole. The under and back part of the Bone, forming two Prominences, where it gives origin to the Aponeurosis, and to several Muscles of the Sole; and before the Prominences, the Bone concave, where it lodges part of these Muscles. The anterior Surface concave, and somewhat in form of a pulley placed obliquely, for its articulation with the Os Cuboides. The Os Calcis is articulated with the Astragalus by Ligaments of such strength, that this part of the Foot, upon which the Body rests, is rendered firm and se- cure, but enjoys very little motion. It gives Origin to the Extensor Brevis Digitorum, Flexor Brevis Digitorum, Flexor Accessorius, and Ab- ductor Pollicis—to part of the Adductor Pollicis, of the Flexor Brevis Pollicis, and Abductor Minimi Di- giti;—Insertion to the Gastrocnemii Externus et In- ternus, and Plantaris. In a Foetus, a large proportion of this Bone is ossi- fied, and the Projection forming the Heel is for some time afterwards an Epiphysis. The Os Naviculare, or boat-like Bone, situated at the fore part of the Astragalus, and inner part of the Foot. The posterior Surface^ forming a Cavity somewhat like that of a Boat, for receiving the Head of the As- tragalus in the manner of Ball and Socket. A Prominence at the inner side of the Bone, for the insertion of Tendons, Muscles, and strong Ligaments,

Insertion : Below that of the Pectoralis Major, by a short and strong Tendon, into a rough surface, on the outer side of the Os Humeri, near its middle, where the Fibres of this Muscle intermix with part of the Brachialis Externus. Action : To pull the Arm directly outwards and up- wards, and a little forwards or backwards, according to the different directions of its Fibres. Coiiaco-Brachialis, vel Coraco-humeralis. Origin : Tendinous and Fleshy, from the fore part of the Coracoid Process of the Scapula, in common with the short Head of the Biceps, to which it adheres through the greater part of its length. Insertion : Tendinous and Fleshy, into the internal part of the Os Humeri, near its middle, where it sends down an Aponeurosis to the internal Condyle of that Bone. Action: To bring the Arm obliquely upwards and forwards. SuBSCAPULARis, vcl Sub-scapulo-trocMneus, Origin: Fleshy, from the three Costse and whole inner Surface of the Scapula. It is composed of a number of Tendinous and Fleshy portions, which run in a radiated manner, and make prints on the Bone.

258 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pari II. Infra-Spinatus, Vel Super-scapulO'trochitereus Magnus, Origin: Fleshy, from all that part of the Dorsum Scapulae which is below its Spine ; and from the Spine itself as far as the Cervix Scapulas. The Fibres run obliquely towards a Tendon in the middle of the Mus- cle, which goes forwards, and adheres to the Capsular Ligament. ,^ Insertion: By a flat thick Tendon, into the upper and outer part of the large Protuberance of the Head of the Os Humeri. Action : To roll the Os Humeri outwards ; to assist in raising, and in supporting it when raised; and to pull the Ligament from between the Bones. These two Muscles are covered by an Aponeurosis, which extends between the Costag and edges of the Spine of the Scapula, and gives rise to many of the Muscular Fibres. Teres Minor, Vel Sufper-scapulo-trocMtereus Minimus. Origin : Fleshy^ from the Inferior Costa of the Sca- pula. It ascends along the under edge of the Infra- spinatus, and adheres to the Capsular Ligament. Insertion : Tendinous into the back part of the large Protuberance on the Head of the Os Humeri, a little below the Infra-spinatus

38 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. of the Superciliary Ridges, about an inch in height, and somewhat more than that in breadth, and, in some Skulls, forming prominences near the root of the Nose. The Walls of the Sinuses, formed by a separation of the tables of the Bone ; there being no Diploe here. The Partition between them placed perpendicularly, and preventing them from having any communication with each other. Their capacities vary much in different Subjects, and they are frequently unequal in size in the same Body. In some they are wanting, which is oftener found to happen in persons having a flat Forehead, and where the Sagittal Suture is continued to the Nose. In others, they are so large as to extend from one side of the Fron- tal Bone to the other. In some Skulls, each of these Sinuses has partial partitions, and, in others, one Sinus occupies the place of two. Sometimes, though rarely, they have a communication with each other. At the inner and under part of the internal Angu- lar Process, a small round Passage from each Sinus, leading into the Cavity of the anterior Ethmoid Cells, and from these to the Nose. The Frontal Sinuses add to the strength and melody of the Voice, by serving as a vault to resound the notes. Hence, in a stoppage of the Nose, by disease or other- wise, the Voice is rendered harsh and disagreeable. The Frontal Bone is composed of two Tables with intermediate Cancelli, is of a moderate thickness, and nearly of equal density throughout, excepting at the Â»Orbitar Plates, which are remarkably thin. The Frontal Bone serves to defend and support the Anterior Lobes of the Brain. It forms a considerable

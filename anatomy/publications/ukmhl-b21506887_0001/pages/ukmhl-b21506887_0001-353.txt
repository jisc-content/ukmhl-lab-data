In the middle of the fore part of the Muscle, there is a lon- gitudinal Tendinous Line, from which Fleshy Fibres run off like the plumage of a feather ; the Tendon it- self being most conspicuous behind. Insertion: Tendinous, into the upper part of the Patella. Action : To extend the Leg. Cruralis, vel Crureus, or Middle of the Tri-femoro- rotuleus.

48 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. giving insertion to strong Muscles, '^particularly the Sterno-mastoid ; and containing Cells which communi- cate with each other, and with the Cavity of the Ear called Tympanum. The Petrous Process^ remarkably hard, very une- qual, and of an oblong form, but becoming smaller in its progress; placed at the base of the Bone, from which it runs obliquely forwards and inwards, and con- tains the internal Organ of Hearing, to be afterwards described. ^ The Zygomatic Process, running almost horizontally from the under and fore part of the Squamous Plate, at first large, then curved, to join the Os Malse; forming a Zygoma or Arch, on the inner side of which the Tem- poral Muscle passes to the Lower Jaw, while its edges give attachment to part of the Temporal and Masseter Muscles, and to the Aponeurosis Temporalis. A Tubercle of an oblong form at the root of this Pro- cess, covered with a smooth Cartilage, making part of the Articulation of the Lower Jaw. The Styloid, or Pencil-Vike Process, placed at the under part of the root of the Pars Petrosa, and going obliquely downwards and forwards, to give origin to Muscles which borrow part of their name from it, and belong to the Tongue and Throat. It is generally about an inch in length, though some- times much longer, and is remarkably slender. It is frequently, even in Adults, not entirely ossified, and is then apt to drop off in macerating the Bones. The Vaginal Process, of an inconsiderable size, sur- rounding the root of the Styloid Process, and deepest at its fore part.

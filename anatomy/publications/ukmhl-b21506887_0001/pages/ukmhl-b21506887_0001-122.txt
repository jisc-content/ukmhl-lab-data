100 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. brse are connected to each other, and the same motion allowed as to these Vertebrse.â€”The projection formed between these two Bones anteriorly, obtains the name of Promontory^ or Greater Angle of the Os Sacrum, The Os Sacrum serves as a common Base and sup- port of the Trunk of the Body, guards the Nerves is- suing from the under end of the Spinal Marrow, de- fends the back part of the Pelvis, and gives origin to Muscles moving the Trunk and Thigh, viz. to the Cur- vator Coccygis, to part of the Latissimus Dorsi, of the Sacro-lumbalis, Longissimus Dorsi, Obliquus Exter- nus Abdominis, Multifidus Spinae, Gluteus Maximus, and Pyriformis. In a Foetus, the Os Sacrum consists of five distinct Vertebrae, each of which has several Osseous Nuclei, and the pieces have Intervertebral Substances similar to those of the True Vertebrae. At this time, each of the Vertebrae of the Os Sacrum, as well as of the True Vertebrae, consists of a Body and two lateral parts^ which are joined together by Cartilages. The Cartilages between the different Vertebrae of the Os Sacrum continue till about the time of Puber- ty, when they are absorbed. Os Coccygis, vel Ossa Coccygis. The Os Coccygis, or Rump-Bone, forming an Ap- pendage to the under end of the Os Sacrum. The Situation of this Bone at the under end of the Os Sacrum.

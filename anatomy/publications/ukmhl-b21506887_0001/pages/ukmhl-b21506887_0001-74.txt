54 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. pearance of Mastoid or Styloid Process; and instead of an Osseous Meatus Externus, there is only a Ring of Bone, in which the Membrana Tympani is fixed. Os Ethmoides. Observe hsre, The sittcation of the Ethmoid, or Cribriform Bone, in the fore part of the Base of the Cranium. Its Cuboid Figure^ and division into middle and la- teral portioiiSj which are connected together at the up- per pa.rt. The Cribriform Plate^ from which the Bone has its name, placed horizontally at the upper part of the Bone, and perforated, excepting at its posterior portion, with many Holes, disposed irregularly and of different sizes, for the transmission of the Branches of the First, or Olfactory Pair of Nerves. In a recent Subject, these holes are so much filled up by the Processes of the Dura Mater which inclose the Nerves, that they are much less evident than in a Bone where the Membranes have been removed. The Crista Galli, or Process compared to the Comb of a Cock, arising perpendicularly from the middle of the Cribriform Plate, and highest at the fore part, be- coming gradually lower in its passage backwards. To the edge of this Process, and to the unimperfb- rated part of the Cribriform Plate, the Falx of the Dura Mater is fixed. A Notch at the fore part of the root of the Crista Galli, contributing, in a small degree, to the formation of the Foramen Caecum of the Frontal Bone.

43 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. Frontis, there is a large Interstice, termed, in common language, Opening of the Head, and by Anatomists, Bregma, Fons, vel Fontanella, from its being supposed by the Ancients, that through it the superfluous Hu- mours of the Brain were evacuated. The Bregma is occupied by a strong Ligamentous Membrane, which adheres firmly to the ragged edges of the Bones, and is lined within by the Dura Mater, and covered externally by the Pericranium. The whole of the Ligamentous Membrane is gene- rally absorbed, and the Bregma filled up with Osseous Matter, by two, though sometimes not till near seven years of age. The Bregma has in some instances, though very rarely, been found open in Adults. Os OCCIPITIS. Here attend to. The Situation of the Occipital Bone in the back and under part of the Cranium. Its rhomboid figure, with the angle above generally a little rounded. The two lateral Angles obtuse. The external surface convex, and smooth at the up- per part. The large rough Arched Ridge, or Transverse Arch, or Linea Semicircularis, running across the Bone, near the middle of the convex surface, to the middle of which the Trapezii Muscles are fixed; the outer and upper parts giving origin to the Occipito-frontalis, and the outer and under, insertion to part of the Sterno- mastoidei.

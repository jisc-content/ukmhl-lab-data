170 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOxMY. [Part I. The Bones of the Smaller Toes, every way less than those of the Fingers. Their under Surface depressed, where the Tendons of their Flexor Muscles are lodged. The Bases of the first Phalanx, as in the Fingers, forming Sockets to receive the Balls or Heads of the Metatarsal Bones. 'or:o?T ^ The Joints between the first and second Phalanx, and also between the second and third, as in the Fin- gers, forming Hinges, and the motion similar, but more confined. Of the Bones of the small Toes, the first, or that next the Great Toe, the largest, the rest becoming smaller the more externally they are placed. The structure of the Bones of the Foot is nearly si- milar to that of the Bones of the Hand. The Phalanges of the small Toes, in general, give Insertion to the Extensor Longus, and also to the Ex- tensor Brevis, with the exception of the Little Toe. The first Phalanx has inserted into it the Lumbricales and Interossei, the second Phalanx the Flexor Brevis, and the third Phalanx the Flexor Longus. To the Little Toe are inserted, besides the Tendons of the general Flexors and Extensors, the Abductor et Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti. The Bones of the Toes allow a free and easy motion in Children, and a considerable degree of it also in people whose feet have not been confined in shoes. In others, especially in advanced life, the Toes are fre- quently found squeezed together, and some of the smallest Bones, as the two last of the little one, have the pieces which originally composed them joined to- gether by a union of substance.

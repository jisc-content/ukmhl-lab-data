The under and back part of the Bone, rendered flat and smooth, by the motion of the Triceps Extensor Cubiti. A large Ridge at the under and outer, and a small Ridge at the under and inner edge of the Bone, for the attachment of strong Tendinous Fasciae, which ^ive origin to part of the Muscles of the Fore-arm.

109 Part I.] OF THE BONES. I The inner part of the Bone broad, and depressed before, where it gives origin to part of the Adductor Muscles of the Thigh. The inner part of the Bone becoming narrower, and ending in the Crus^ which goes downwards to join the Crus of the Os Ischium, and form, along with that Crus, one side of the Arch of the Pubis. The Foramen Ovale, vel Thyroideum, passing down- wards and outwards, and of a triangular shape, with the angles blunted. It is formed by the Os Pubis and Os Ischium, and in the Subject is filled, excepting at the Notch above mentioned, by a Membranous Liga- ment, which gives rise to a large share of the Obtura- tor Muscles. The Acetabulum, or Cavity, (compared to a Vinegar measure used by the ancients), placed farther out and a little higher than the Foramen Thyroideum, and formed by the three pieces which compose the Os In- nominatum, in such a manner, that the Os Ilium con- stitutes less than two-fifths, the Os Ischium more than two-fifths, and the Os Pubis one-fifth of that Cavity. The Cavity of the Acetabulum very deep, especially behind, and made still deeper in the Subject, by its Brim being tipped with a Cartilaginous Ligament. Round the outer edge of the Brim, the Bone rough, where the Capsular Ligament of the Joint is fixed. A Breach in the inner and fore part of the Acetabu- lum, which, in the Subject, has a strong Ligament stretched from one end of that Notch to the other, but leaving a Hole behind for containing part of the substance called Gland of the Joint. The Cavity oi the Acetabulum lined ^ith Cartilage,

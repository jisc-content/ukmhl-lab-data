165 Part I.] OF THE BONES. particularly for the Ligament stretched between this Bone and the Os Calcis, for the support of the Astra- galus. The fore part of the Bone convex, and divided into three articular Surfaces, for the articulation with the Ossa Cuneiformia. Between the Os Naviculare and Astragalus, the foot has its principal lateral and rotatory motions, though each of the other Joints of the Tarsus contributes a little. The Os Naviculare gives insertion to part of the Ti- bialis Posticus. The three Ossa Cuneiformia, or Wedge-shaped Bones, situated at the fore part of the Tarsus, and inner side of the Os Cuboides, and applied to each other like the stones of an Arch. The upper part of these Bones, flat, where they are covered with Ligaments. The under part irregular, for the attachment of Muscles and strong Ligaments lying in the Sole. The posterior Surface, fiat, and covered with Carti- lage, to be articulated with the Os Naviculare. The anterior Surface, also fiat, for the articulation with the Metatarsal Bones. The Os Cuneforme Internum, vel Maximum, vel Primum, the largest of the Cuneiform Bones, and placed obliquely, with its anterior Surface opposed to the Metatarsal Bone of the Great Toe. The sharp Edge of this Bone turned upwards, while that of the other two Bones is in the opposite direction. It gives Origin to the short Head of the Abductor

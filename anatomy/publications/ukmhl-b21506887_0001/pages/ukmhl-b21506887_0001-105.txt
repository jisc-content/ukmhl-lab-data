Part I.] OF THE BONES. 83 The Incisores, placed in the fore part of the Jaw, hav- ing their Bases formed into Wedges sloped out behind. The Cuspidatus, farther back than the former, hav- ing its Base in form of a Wedge^ like the Incisores, but pointed in the middle. The Bicuspidati, still farther back, each with double points^ one external, the other internal, which, in the Upper Jaw, are nearly upon a level, but, in the Under Jaw, highest on the outside of the Teeth. The Incisores, Cuspidatus, and Bicuspidati, with single Roots, excepting the small Molares of the Up- per Jaw, which have frequently two Roots. The first of the three posterior, or large Molares of the Under Jaw, with five, and each of the other two with four points. Each of these three Teeth, having two, three, or sometimes four roots. In the Upper Jaw, the first large Molaris having four, and each of the other two only three points. In each of these three Teeth, generally one root more in those of the Upper, than in the corresponding Teeth of the Under Jaw. The last, or backmost Molaris, called Sapiens, smaller, and having generally^/^iX'^r roots. The Teeth connected to the Sockets by Gomphosis, and by a firm adhesion to the Gums. At Birth, the outer shell only of the five Temporary Teeth, and of the anterior Permanent Molaris, in each side of each Jaw, is found. These Teeth are situated in Capsules, within the Jaw. At this period there are no roots formed. For a fuller descriptio7i of the Teeth, see Vol. II.

Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS. 331 redder colour, from the numerous Blood-vessels dis- persed upon them. They have been generally considered as Glands lodg- ed within masses of Fat; but, upon a minute inspec- tion, no knotty or Glandular Bodies are to be found in them; nor have they the appearance of Glands farther than in being secreting Substances; which circumstance alone assimilates them to the nature of Glands. From the edges of these Fatty Bodies, there are pen- dulous Fimbrice, which convey a lubricating Liquor, called Synovia^ into the Cavity of the Joints. From the extremities of these Fringes, the Liquor can be readily squeezed out by pressure ; but their Ca- vities and Orifices are so minute, or are otherwise of such a nature, as to have hitherto eluded discovery. The Fimbriae have been generally considered as Ex- cretory Ducts of Glands within the Joints. Dr Monro, however, in his Work upon the Bursas Mucosae, sup- poses them to be of the nature of the Follicles of the Urethra, which prepare a Mucilaginous Liquor, with- out the assistance of any knotty or Glandular Organ. The Arteries which supply these Bodies with Blood for their Secretion, and the Veins which return the Blood after the Secretion has been performed, can be readily seen; but no Nerves can be traced in them; nor does it appear that they possess a higher degree of Sen- sibility than the other parts of the Joints already de- scribed, although, when they inflame and suppurate, they have in some instances been observed to occasion the most excruciating pain. The Synovia, which is a thin Mucilaginous Liquor resembling the glair of an egg, appears to be furnished

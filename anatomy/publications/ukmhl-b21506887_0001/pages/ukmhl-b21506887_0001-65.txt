Part I.] OF THE BONES. 45 The upper Limb of the perpendicular Spine hollow in the middle, or frequently at one side, and that com- monly the right one, for the reception of the superior longitudinal Sinus, and the attachment of the Falx. The lateral Limbs, placed opposite to the great ex- ternal arched Ridge, and hollozv in the middle, for con- taining the lateral Sinuses, and giving attachment to the Tentorium Durae Matris. The hollow in one of the lateral Limbs, and more especially the right one, is frequently the continuation of that made in the perpendicular Spine by the longi- tudinal Sinus, and therefore is often larger than the other, which, in such cases, is occupied by the continu- ation of the Vein termed Torcular Herophili. The lower Limb of the perpendicular Spine short, and sometimes double, for the attachment of the Falx Minor ; sometimes it is hollow, for the reception of an Occipital Sinus. The Cerebral Fossce at the sides of the upper Limb, for containing the posterior Lobes of the Cerebrum. The FosscB at the sides of the lower Limb, for con- taining the Cerebellum. Anterior to the Fossae for lodging the Cerebellum, and a little to the outer side of the Foramen Magnum, two Cavities for receiving the lateral Sinuses, previous to their passing through the base of the Cranium. The concave Surface of the Cuneiform Process, for receiving the Medulla Oblongata, Basilar Artery, and Accessory Nerves. The depressions at each side of the Cuneiform Pro- cess, where the inferior Petrosal Sinuses are placed. The Foramen Magnum Occipitis, behind the Basilar

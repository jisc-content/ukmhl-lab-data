Of these three are termed True, from having serrated appear- ances ; and two are called False or Squamous Sutures, from the Bones which form them overlapping each other, as the Scales of Fishes do.

It begins some way below the Vertex, or Crown of the Head, from which its two Legs extend obliquely downwards and to each side, in form of the Greek A. The parts of the Lambdoid Suture, placed between the Occipital and Temporal Bones, have little of the serrated appearance, and are called Additamenta Su~ turoe Lambdoidalis. The Sagittal Suture, situated between the Parietal Bones, and named from being extended between the middle of the Coronal and beginning of the Lambdoid Sutures, as an Arrow is between the String and Bow,

This projection of the Chin is less apparent in a Ne- gro, where the Alveolar Border is so expanded as to increase the prominence of the Mouth. The Sides, reaching from the Mental Foramina to the back part of the Bone. A Transverse Ridge on the fore part of the Chin, with depressions on each side, for the Origin of Mus- cles of the Under Lip, Small Prominences and Depressions on the under, inner, or back part of the Chin, for the attachment of the Fragnum Linguae, and of several Muscles which belong to the Throat. The Base^ or lowest part, forming the under boun- dary of the Face. The Angles of the J aw at the back part of the Base, Impressions made by the Masseter Muscle upon the outside of the angle, and also on the Plate which arises from it. The plate, which rises from the angle of the Jaw, on each side, running upwards and a little backwards, and terminating in two Processes^ termed Condyloid and Coronoid. The Condyloid^ or Articular Process^ with an oblong rounded head, covered with Cartilage, and placed al- most transversely upon a Cervix at the upper and back part of the Bone; though, with respect to each dther,

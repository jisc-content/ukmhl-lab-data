Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. 287 spreading out and forming a Muscle of great magni- tude. Insertion : Into the whole length of the Linea As-^ pera; the under part of the Muscle extending along the Ridge which leads to the inner Condyle of the Os Femoris. It is also fixed by a roundish Tendon, into the upper part of the Condyle, a little above which, the Femoral Artery, in its course towards the Ham, passes between the Tendon of this Muscle and the Bone. Action of the three Adductors : To bring the Thigh inwards and upwards, according to the different di- rections of their Fibres, and to assist a little in rolling it outwards. Obturator Externus, Vel Suh-puMo-trochantereus Eocternus. Origin : On the outer side of the Pelvis, by a semi- circular Margin, from the Parts of the Ossa Pubis and Ischium, which form the anterior half of the Foramen Thyroideum, and from the Membrane which fills up that Foramen. The Fibres run like rays towards a centre, and pass outwards over the back part of the Cervix of the Os Femoris. Insertion: By a strong round Tendon into the Cavity at the inner and back part of the Root of the Trochan- ter Major, adhering in its course to the Capsular Liga- ment of the Thigh-bone. Action : To roll the Thigh-bone obliquely outwards, and to prevent the Capsular Ligament from being pinched.

n4s COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pakt It Spinous Process of the Os Ilium, over the Flexor Mus- cle^ and great Vessels and Nerves of tlie Thigh, to the upper part of the Os Pubis, to which it is fixed. This part of the Tendon, which was formerly de- scribed by the name of Poupart's or Fallopius's, or Inguinal Ligament, forms a curve behind, but more especially over the Blood-vessels, and therefore is now known by the name of Crural Arch. Somewhat higher, and farther out, than the Symphy^ sis Pubis, or about an inch and a half in a full-sized Adult, PouPART^s Ligament divides into an upper and under column. The upper column is fixed to the Ligament of the Symphysis Pubis, and to the Os Pubis of the opposite side. The under one is twisted or doubled in, and in- serted into the upper part of the Os Pubis, and Pubal portion of the Linea Ilio-pectinea, from the Femoral Vessels, as far as the Crest or Tuberosity of the Bone, and forms a firm sharp line towards the Abdomen, which constitutes the posterior edge of the Crural Arch, or forms the Crural Ring of Gimbernat, of late so frequently mentioned by Surgeons. The posterior edge of the Crural Arch is quite tense, when the Limb is extended ; but when the Thigh is much bent, the edge of the Arch is relaxed, so as to favour* the return of the Bowels in the reduction of Crural Hernia. The under column is looser and more slender in a Female than in a Male; and the space between the Femoral Vessels and the insertion of this part of the Ligament is larger ; in consequence of which, Protru-

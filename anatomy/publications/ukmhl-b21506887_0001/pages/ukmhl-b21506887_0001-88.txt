66 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. the Bone is joined to its fellow, a strong Arch is form- ed, that is fitted for resisting injury. The inner margin thick and broad above, but thin below, where it joins its fellow on the opposite side. Its internal Concavity/, where it forms part of the Cavity of the Nose. The Spinous Process, which joins the Nasal Lamella of the Ethmoid Bone, and thereby forms part of the partition of the Nose. One or more Holes externally, for transmitting Ves- sels into the substance of the Bone, or to the Mem- brane of the Nose. The substance of the Bone remarkably firm and strong, with very few Cancelli. Its Connexion to the Frontal Bone, by the transverse Suture. To its fellow by the anterior Nasal Suture. The Ossa Nasi form the upper and fore part of the Nose, and give attachment to the Compressor Naris, and to part of the Occipito-frontalis. In a Foetus, the Ossa Nasi are proportionally short, but are otherwise complete. Ossa Unguis, vel Laceymalia. Their Situation at the inner and fore part of the Orbit. Their Size, the least of the Bones of the Face. The Division of each externally, into two depressed Surfaces, with a Ridge between them which forms the boundary of the Orbit at the inner Angle. The Ridge between these Surfaces frequently forms

Paet L] of the bones. 71 tril, to the edge of which, and to the corresponding one of the Nasal Process, the Cartilages of the side of the Nose are connected. The Lacrymal Fossa, at the outer and back part of the Nasal Process, which, with that of the Os Unguis, forms a passage for the Lacrymal Duct into the Nose. A Canal, termed hifra-orhitar, in the Orbitar Plate, terminated anteriorly by the Foramen Infra-orhitarium, through which the Infra-orbitar Branch of the second part of the Fifth Pair of Nerves, with a Branch of the internal Maxillary Artery, pass to the Face. From this Canal, minute Passages lead downwards, for receiving the Blood-vessels and Nerves that supply the fore part of the Jaw and corresponding Teeth. The Foramen Incisivum, vel Palatum Anterius, be- hind the Fore-Teeth, common to both Bones below, but proper to each above, and filled with a Process of the Soft Palate, and with Small Vessels and Nerves, which run between the Membranes of the Mouth and Nose; the Nerves chiefly belonging to the Naso-pala- tine Branch of the Second Portion of the Fifth Pair. In some Subjects, there is a distinct Ductus Incisi- vus, leading from one or from both Nostrils into the Cavity of the Mouth, similar to that which is always found in large Quadrupeds. A small Hole commonly found in the Nasal Process, and some minute Passages at the back part of the Tu- berosity, for the transmission of Blood-vessels and Nerves into the substance of the Bone and Large Dentes Molares, and into the Antrum Maxillare. The Sinus Maocillaris, Antrum Maxillare, or, from its dA3scriber, Highmorianum, of great size, being the

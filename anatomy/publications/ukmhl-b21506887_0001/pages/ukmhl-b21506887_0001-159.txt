Part I,] 137 OF THE BONES. The Structure of the Radius and Ulna is the same as that of other long Bones. The Head of the Radius is articulated with the outer part of the articular Surface of the Os Humeri; the Radius is besides joined by a double articulation to the Ulna; for above, the Head of the Radius is received into the small Sigmoid Cavity of the Ulna, while the under end of the Ulna is received into the small Semi- lunar Cavity of the Radius ; in consequence of which connexion, the Radius accompanies the Ulna in the flexion and extension of the Fore-arm, while it moves round its own axis above; but, at the lower end, it turns upon the round Head of the Ulna, carrying the Hand with it. The turning of the Radius with the Hand is termed Supination and Pronation ; when the Palm is turned upwards, it is in a state of supination, and in pronation when in a contrary direction. The Radius gives Origin to part of the Flexor Digi- torum Sublimis, Flexor Longus, et Extensor Ossis Me- tacarpi Pollicis.â€”Insertion to the Biceps Flexor Cubi- ti, Supinatores Longus et Brevis, Pronatores Teres et Quadrat us. In a Foetus, the extremities of the Bones of the Fore-arm are Cartilaginous ; they afterwards become Epiphyses, before they are united to the Bodies of the Bones,

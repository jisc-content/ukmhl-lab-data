70 COMPENDIUM OP ANATOMY. [Part I. A Depression at the under and fore part of the Ma- lar Process, where the Muscles which raise the Upper Lip and corner of the Mouth, originate, and where a Branch of the Fifth Pair of Nerves is lodged, and commonly a large portion of Fat. The Alveolar Arch^ at the under part of the Bone, of a Spongy nature, where the Alveoli or Sockets of the Teeth are placed. The Alveoli^ or Sockets of the Teeth, porous, for the firmer adhesion of the reflected Membrane of the Gums, and for the transmission of Blood-vessels into the substance of the Bone ; the Sockets corresponding in number with those of the Teeth, and varying in depth, size, and form, according to the nature of the Teeth fixed in them. The Palate Plate or Process, placed horizontally, forming part of the Roof of the Mouth, and of the Bottom of the Nose. The Palate Plate, thin in its middle, and thicJc at its edges ; smooth towards the Nose, but rough, unequal, and porous below, for the firm connexion of the Mem- brane of the Palate, and for the passage of Blood- vessels and Nerves to the substance of the Bone. The Nasal Spine, contributing, in a small degree, to the formation of the Septum of the Nose. An Arch formed by the Palate Plate, both above and below, for enlarging the Cavities of the Nose and Mouth. In advanced life, where the Teeth have fallen out, the Roof of the Mou th, which was formerly arched, becomes flat,, in consequence of an absorption of the Alveoli, and the Cavity of the Mouth is now diminished in size. A Notch forming the under and fore part of the Nos-

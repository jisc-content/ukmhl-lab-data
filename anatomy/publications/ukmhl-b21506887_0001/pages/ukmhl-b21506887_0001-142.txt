120 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paet L low, and sometimes considerably broader. It is near- ly of the same thickness throughout. Complete Pits upon the edges of this piece, for the Cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth Pair of Hibs, and part of the Pits for those of the second and seventh. Lines extending across the Bone, between the Pits, denoting the original marks of division of this piece. The Connexion of the second piece of the Sternum to the first by Cartilage, which, in the earlier period of life, allows some yielding, but this becoming gra- dually less as the person advances in life. The third piece of the Sternum Cartilaginous in a young Subject, and pointed like a broad-sword, hence termed Cartilago Ensiformis. An Adult has this piece commonly ossified in the middle, and Cartilaginous at the edges. The Size of this piece much less than that of the other two. Only one half of the Pit, for the Cartilage of the seventh Rib, formed in each side of this piece. The Variations of the Cartilago Ensiformis are con- siderable in diiferent Subjects;â€”for, instead of the common form, it is sometimes narrower like the point of a small sword, or turned obliquely to one side, or forwards, or backwards, or forked at the point, or per- forated in the middle. The Sternum is joined by Cartilage to the seven upper or True Ribs, on each side, and by an inter- articular Cartilage to the anterior ends of the Clavicles. The Sternum defends the Heart and Lungs, assists in the formation of the Thorax, sustains the Medias-

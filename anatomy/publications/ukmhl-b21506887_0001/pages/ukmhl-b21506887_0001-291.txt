Part II.1 of the muscles. 231 Thoracic Duct. The other Heads arise from the third, and also from the second Lumbar Vertebra, and are placed farther out. From the different Heads the; Muscular Fibres run upwards, and form, in the mid- dle, two Fleshy Columns, or Crura, which decussate, and leave an Opening for the passage of the Esopha- gus. Insertion : By strong Fleshy Fibres, into the poste- rior Edge of the Cordiform, or middle Tendon. Action of the Diaphragm : To enlarge the Cavity of the Thorax during Inspiration, by its Fleshy part con- tracting, and bringing its two sides down from a con-, vex to a plain Surface; the Abdominal Muscles at the same time yielding, but the Tendinous part of the Dia- phragm remaining nearly in the same situation. In Ex- piration, the Diaphragm is replaced, chiefly by the ac- tion of the Abdominal Muscles. It is the Antagonist of the Abdominal Muscles in Inspiration, but acts in concert with them in Dejection and in Vomiting ; though, with respect to this last circumstance, the ac- tion begins in the Diaphragm. QuADRATus LuMBoRUM, vel Ilio-Costalis. Origin: Broad, Tendinous, and Fleshy, from the posterior half of the Spine of the Os Ilium, and from a Ligament extended between it and the Transverse Pro- cess of the last Lumbar Vertebra. Insertion: Into the Transvere Processes of all the Lumbar Vertebrae; into the last Rib, near the Spine ; and, by a small Tendon, into the side of the Last Dor- sal Vertebra.

178 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II, The Belly, or thickest part, which swells when a Muscle is in action ; The Insertion, or Termination, or that extremity which is implanted into the part to be moved, and which is commonly smaller than the Origin. The Division of a Muscle into Fleshy and Tendi- nous parts. The Fleshy part distinguished by being soft, sen- sible, generally of a red colour,—from the great quan- tity of Blood in it,—and possessing contractility. The fleshy part, composed of a collection of some- what elastic semi-pellucid Fibres, of different sizes, run- ning frequently in a parallel direction, but often con- verging towards one of the extremities of the Muscle. The Fibres are intermixed with Blood-vessels, Lym- phatics, and Nerves, with some Cellular Substance and Fat. The size of the Fibres varies in different parts of the Body ; they increase as a person advances towards maturity, and they become firmer and stronger by fre- quent exertion. The larger Fibres may be divided into smaller, and these into still smaller, till at length they escape the observation of the naked Eye» The ultimate Fibres of Muscles have been consi- dered by some as a collection of solid Cords, by many as hollow Tubes, while several have described them as being composed of a chain of little Vesicles. The Muscular Fibres consist chiefly of Fibrin, with a small quantity of Gelatin, Albumen, ^nd Saline Mat- ter. The Division of Muscles into Rectilineal, as in the

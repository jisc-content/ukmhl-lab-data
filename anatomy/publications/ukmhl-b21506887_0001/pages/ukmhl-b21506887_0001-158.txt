136 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. convex on its outer and back part, and rounded here by the Muscles which cover it. The anterior and posterior Surfaces next the Ulna flat, where Muscles of the Hand take their origin. The antej'ior and posterior Surfaces, terminating next the Ulna, in a sharp Ridge, to which the Inter- osseous Ligament of the Fore-arm is fixed. A Passage slanting upwards, on the fore part of the Bone, and about a hand-breadth below its upper end, for the Medullary Vessels. A roifgh Surface, at the outer and middle part of the Bone, for the insertion of the Pronator Radii Teres. The lower e7id of the Radius, becoming gradually larger, and flat on its fore part, where it is covered by the Pronator Radii Quadratus. A Ridge upon the under and back part of the Ra- dius, with a Fossa upon each side of it, where the Tendons of the Extensor Muscles of the Fingers pass. The outer side of this extremity of the Bone hollow- ed by the Extensors of the Thumb. A semilimar Cavity at the inner side of the under end of the Radius, lined with Cartilage, for receiving the corresponding extremity of the Ulna. The loiver end of the Bone, formed into a Cavity of .an oval or navicidar shape, and lined with Cartilage, for receiving the two first Bones of the Carpus. A small Transverse Ridge, frequently found in the middle of this Cavity, which insinuates itself between the two first Bones of the Carpus. The under and outer part of the Radius, forming a Process somewhat similar to the Styloid Process of the Ulna. From this a Ligament is sent to the Wrist.

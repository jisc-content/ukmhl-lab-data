79 Part I ] OF THE BONES. the Condyles are somewhat oblique, the external ex- tremity being directed a little forward. At the under and fore part of the Condyle, a cavity for the insertion of the Pterygoideus Externus. The Coronoid Process, into which the Temporal Muscle is inserted, situated sl little lower than the Con- dyloid Process, and, in the natural situation of the Jaw, placed on the inner side of the Zygoma, The Anterior Edge of this process, forming a Ridge which goes downwards and forwards, terminating at the outside of the Posterior AlTeoli. From this the under edge of the Buccinator takes its Origin. From the inner side of the Coronoid Process, ano- ther Ridge of the Buccinator takes its Origin. From the inner side of the Coronoid Process, ano- ther Ridge seen terminating nearly opposite to the former. To this the Internal Membrane of the Gums^ and Mylo-hyoideus, are attached. The Alveolar Process, and Alveoli, nearly similar to those of the Upper Jaw. The Alveolar Process, extending along the Upper Edge of the Bone, from the Coronoid Process of one side to that of the other; and thickest behind, correÂ» sponding there with the increased thickness of the Teeth. The Alveolar Process, composed of two Plates^ and divided by cross Partitions, which, as in the Upper Jaw, mark the different Alveoli for the Fangs of the Teeth. The Posterior Part of the Internal Plate, slanting inwards, and thinner thaw the external, giving the J aw a twisted appearance,

50 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part 1. Around the external Meatus, a rough suKace, for the connexion of the Cartilages and Ligaments of the Ear. The Foramen Stylo-mastoideum, or Aqueduct of Fal- LOPius, between the Styloid and Mastoid Processes, and at the root of the Pars Petrosa, for the transmission of the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair of Nerves. The Foramen Caroticum, vel Canalis Caroticus, at the inner and fore part of the Jugular Fossa, and also before and at the inside of the Styloid Process, leading upv/ards, then forwards, through the Pars Petrosa, for the transmission of the internal Carotid Artery to, and of the Great Sympathetic Nerve from, the Brain. In the upper and back part of the Canal, one, some- times two minute Holes are observed, through which the internal Carotid Artery sends one or two Twigs to the Tympanum. The Iter a Potato ad Aurem, or Eustachian Tube, between the Fissure for the Capsular Ligament of the Lower Jaw, and the passage of the internal Carotid Artery, and under the contiguous parts of the Spinous Process of the Sphenoid Bone and Pars Petrosa, extend- ing outwards and backwards in a horizontal direction, till it terminates in the Tympanum. In the Subject, it is formed, by the addition of Car- tilage and Ligament, into a trumpet-like Tube, which is continued forwards and inwards to the back part of the Nostril, and conveys air from the Nose to the Tym- panum of the Ear. On the external side of the Osseous part of the Eus- tachian Tube, and at the top of the Glenoid Fissure, is the course of the Nerve termed Chorda Tympani,

Paet II.] OF THE MUSCLES. 263 thick and strong Band, that, running transversely, gets the name of Ligamentum Carpi Annulare Pos- terius. The use of this Aponeurosis, like that in other parts of the Body, is to form a kind of Bandage to brace the Muscles, and keep them in their proper place while in action, and to give Origin to many of the Muscular Fibres which lie immediately under it. Biceps Flexor Cubiti, Vel Biceps, vel Scapulo-radiaUs. Origin : By two Heads : The outer one, called its Long Head, begins by a slender Tendon from the up- per edge of the Glenoid Cavity of the Scapula, passes over the Ball of the Os Humeri within the Joint, and in its descent without the Joint, is inclosed in a Groove upon the upper and fore part of the Bone, by a Liga- ment which proceeds from the Capsular one and adja- cent Tendons : The inner one, called it^ Short Head, arises, Tendinous and Fleshy, from the Coracoid Pro- cess of the Scapula, in common with the Coraco-Bra- chialis. A little below the middle of the fore part of the Os Humeri, the two Heads unite, and form a thick Fleshy Belly, Insertion: By a strong roundish Tendon, in the Tubercle at the upper and inner part of the Radius, and by a Tendinous Expansion, into the Apon-eurosis of the Fore-arm, which it likewise assists in forming. Action: To bend the Fore-Arm, and to assist the Su- pinator Muscles in rolling the Radius outwards, and of

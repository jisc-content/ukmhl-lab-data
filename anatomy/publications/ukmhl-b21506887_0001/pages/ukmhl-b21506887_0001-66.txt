46 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. Process, and between the Condyles, for the passage of the Medulla Oblongata, and its investing Membranes, with the Vertebral Blood-vessels, and Accessory Nerves. The Foramen Magnum, of a rhomboid, or oval form, with the short diameter placed transversely, correspond- ing with the shape of the Spinal Marrow, by which it is chiefly occupied. The superior or anterior Condyloid Foramina, at the sides of the Foramen Magnum, and immediately over the Condyles, for the passage of the ninth pair of Nerves. The posterior Condyloid Foramina, at the back part of the root of the Condyles, for the passage of Veins from the Occiput, or from the deep parts of the Neck, into the lateral Sinuses, near their terminations. Frequently one of the posterior Condyloid Forami- na is wanting; sometimes both, :when the Veins pass through the Foramen Magnum. Besides the Holes above taken notice of, others are often found, near the edges of the Bone, for the trans- mission of Veins, the number and size of which are un- certain. This Bone is among the strongest of the Cranium, though very unequal in thickness; being thick and strong above, where it is little impressed by Muscles, and so thin below, where it is pressed by the weight of the Cerebellum internally, and affected by the action of the Muscles externally, as to be in many Skulls renr dered transparent. But the thick Muscles and strong- Spines and Protuberances of the Bone, assist greatly in preventing injuries from happening here.

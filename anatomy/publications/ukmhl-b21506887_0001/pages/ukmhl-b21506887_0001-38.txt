18 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [VauH I. as the Bone continues to grow, more Laminae are add- ed, till the more solid part of a Bone is formed. The Inner Layers of the Bones are observed to be more porous than the Outer, and none of them are found to have the solidity they acquire in the Adult state, till they have arrived at their full growth. The Ossification of long' Bones begins between the Periosteum and Membrana MeduUaris, in a Jelly which afterwards hardens into Cartilage, and forms a Central Ring, from which the Fibres extend towards the ends of the Bone. The Interior Lamellae, forming the solid sides of the long Bones, are considerably shorter than the Ex- terior, because they pass gradually inwards to form the Cancelli, while the exterior parts are continued to the extremities of the Bones. The Ossification of spherical-shaped Bones, as in the Wrist, begins by one Nucleus, and that of irregular- formed Bones, as in the Vertebrae, by different Nuclei; and both of these sets of Bones have their origin in Cartilage. In proportion as Osseous Matter is deposited, the Cartilage is absorbed, leaving behind it the different Cavities and Cancelli. All the parts termed Epiphyses, likewise, have their original formation in Cartilage. The Ossification which begins in Cartilage is consi- derably later than that which has its origin between Membranes, and this is at very different times in diffe- rent parts of the Body ; the processes being soonest completed in those Bones which cover the Organs most essential to life.

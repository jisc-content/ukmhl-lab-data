Pabt III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS. 359 to a Pit behind the above-mentioned rough Protube- rance. These Ligaments, in the extended state of the Leg, prevent it from going forward beyond a straight line with the Thigh. When the Knee is bent, they allow the Foot to be turned outwards, but not in a contrary direction. The two inter-articular Cartilages, called Semilunar from their shape like a Crescent, placed upon the top of the Tibia. The outer convex edge of each of these Cartilages is thick, while the inner concave edge becomes thin and sharp like a knife or sickle ; and being concave above, the Sockets for the Condyles of the Os Femoris are rendered deeper, and this Bone and the Tibia are more accurately adapted to each other. Each of these Cartilages is broad in the middle, their extremities becoming narrower and thinner as they ap- proach one another. Each covers about two-thirds of the Superficial Cavity,of the Top of the Tibia, leaving one-third bare in the middle. The extremities are termed Cornua, and are fixed by Ligaments to the Protuberance of the Tibia. The anterior Cornua are joined to each other by a Trans'verse Ligament. The convex edge of these Cartilages is fixed to the Capsular and other Ligaments, in such a manner as to allow the Cartilages to play a little upon the Cartila- ginous Surface of the Tibia, by which the motions of that Bone upon the Condyles of the Os Femoris are facilitated.

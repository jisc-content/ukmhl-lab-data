134 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. roughs for the attachment of the Capsular Ligament of the Joint. The Small Sigmoid, or Semilunar Cavity^ lined with Cartilage, at the outer side of the Coronoid Pro- cess, where the round Head of the Radius plays, which is confined in its place by an Annular Ligament, fixed to the Edges of this Cavity. The Tubercle of the Ulna, or small rough spot un- der the root of the Coronoid Process, for the insertion of the Brachialis Internus. At the upper and outer part of the Bone, a triangu- lar Surface, where the Anconeus is lodged. The Bodi/ of the Ulna, of a triangular form, be- coming gradually smaller in its descent. The sharpest Angle opposed to the Radius, for the attachment of the Interosseous Ligament. The sides forming this angle, jlat, and marked by the Muscles which arise from them. A Passage slanting upwards, about a hand-breadth below the upper end, for the Medullary Vessels. The under end of the Bone, forming a small round Head, which is covered with Cartilage on that side where the Radius moves upon it, and also on its ex- tremity, where it is opposed to a moveable Cartilage placed between it and the Carpus. The Styloid Process, at the inner side of the small round Head, from which a strong Ligament goes off to be fixed to the Bones of the Wrist. The Ulna is articulated at its superior extremity with the lower end of the Os Humeri, the Joint at this part forming a complete Hinge, which allows an extensive degree of flexion, and as much extension as to approach

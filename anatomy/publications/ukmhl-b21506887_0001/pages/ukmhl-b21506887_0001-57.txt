Part I.J OF THE BONES. 37 minute Arteries or Nerves into the Sinuses, or to the Substance of the Bone. The concave inner and fore part of the Os Frontis, for lodging the Anterior Lobes of the Brain. The convex under parts, for supporting these Lobes, and covering the Eyes. The Ridges and Depressions of the Orbitar Processes, marked by the convolutions of the Brain. Small Furrows on the inside of the Bone, for lodg- ing Blood-vessels of the Dura Mater. Slight Sinuosities^ more evident on the under than on the upper part of the Bone, occasioned by the con- volutions of the anterior part of the Brain. The Frontal Spine, or Crista Interna, in the middle of the under part of the Bone, formed by the coales- cence of the inner tables, for the attachment of the Falx of the Dura Mater. In such Skulls as have the Sagittal Suture continued to the Nose, the Frontal Spine does not appear ; the inner Plates, in such cases, not having grown together to form it. The Frontal Furrow, extending upwards from the Spine, and becoming gradually larger in its course, for lodging the upper part of the superior Longitudinal Sinus of the Dura Mater, and for the attachment of the Falx. The Foramen Ccecum at the under part of the Spine, for the reception of a Process of the Falx, and of small Blood-vessels which penetrate into the Nose, or to the substance of the Bone. Plere also the superior Longi- tudinal Sinus takes its origin. This Hole is frequent- ly common to the Frontal and Ethmoid Bones. The Frontal Sinuses, placed behind the inner ends

Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. 241 Action: To move the Clavicle and Scapula, accord- ing to the directions of its different Fibres. The su- perior Fibres descending, raise the shoulder; the middle running transversely, pull it backwards ; and the inferior Fibres descending, depress it. The whole acting together, bring it directly back. When the Scapula is fixed, the Muscle assists in moving the Head backwards, Latissimus'Borsi, vel Lumho-humeralis, Origin : By a broad Tendinous Expansion, from the posterior part of the Spine of the Os Ilium ; from all the Spinous Processes of the Vertebrae extending be- tween the under end of the Os Sacrum and sixth Dor- sal Vertebra, and, by three or four Tendinous or Fleshy Slips, from an equal number of inferior Ribs. The Tendon by degrees changes into a Muscle of great breadth, the inferior Fibres of which run upwards and outwards, and the superior transversely over the under Angle of the Scapula, receiving a small Slip from that Bone in their way to the Axilla, where the Fibres of the Muscle in general are collected, twisted, and fold- ed, like those of the Pectoralis Major. Insertion: By a strong thin Tendon, into the inner Edge of the Groove for lodging the Tendon of the long Head of the Biceps. Action: To pull the Arm downwards and backwards, and to roll the Os Humeri inwards, by which the Palm of the Hand is made to face backwards. When the Pectoralis Major acts at the same time with this Muscle, the Arm is brought directly down towards the Trunk. VOL. I. Q

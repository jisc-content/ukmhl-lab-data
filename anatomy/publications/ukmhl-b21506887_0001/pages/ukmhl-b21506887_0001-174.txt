152 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. ing obliquely between the two Trochanters, for the Insertion of the Capsular Ligament. A rough Line between the Trochanters, on the hack part of the Bone, for the Insertion of the Capsular Ligament, and of the Quadratus Femoris. The Body of the Thigh-bone hent forwards, and a little outwards, of a roundish form above, but somewhat triangular about its middle. The Jhre part of the Bone, Jlat, where it is covered by the Crureus. The Sides of the Bone flattened at its middle and lower part by the two Vasti. The Linea Aspera, or Ragged Ridge, on the back part of the Bone, extending from the Trochanters, but chiefly from the large one, to the lower part of the Bone, and giving attachment to numerous Muscles which pass from the Pelvis to the Thigh, or from the Thigh to the Leg. The Linea Aspera, forked at both its extremities ; extending above to the Trochanters, while below the two lines into which it divides terminate in the Con- dyles. The Canal for the Medullary Vessels, slanting up- wards, on the posterior part of the Bone, a little below its middle height. The under and hack part of the Bone flat, where the Popliteal Vessels and Nerves are placed. The lower End of the Bone becoming gradually lar- ger, and perforated by many Holes, for the Insertion of the Capsular Ligament of the Knee, and for the passage of the Nutritious Vessels of the Bone.

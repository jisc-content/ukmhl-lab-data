Part I.j OF THE BONES. 13 The Blood-vessels of the Marrow, surrounded by the Periosteum, enter the Bones by oblique Canals, which have already been taken notice of in the description of the Bones in general. When the Arteries have entered the Cavities of the Bones, they divide into Branches, which are spread out upon the Cancelli, Membrana Medullaris, and Mar- row ; from these many minute Branches are reflected outwards to the Tables of the Bones, which communi- cate with those sent from the inner surface of the Pe- riosteum. The Veins which return the blood from the Marrow and substance of the Bones, are collected into small Trunks, which pass out where the Arteries penetrated the Bones, and discharge their contents into the neigh- bouring Veins. The greater degree of Vascularity of the solids in Children than in Adults is no where more conspicuous than here ; for Injections which pass readily in these Vessels in Children, cannot be made to penetrate so far in those of persons more advanced in life. In conse- quence of which, the Marrow is found to be thin and bloody in Children, oily and thick in Adults, and wa- tery in old people. The Marrow, like the Fat, when viewed through a Microscope, resembles a cluster of pearls ;â€”or it is contained in Spherical Sacs, upon which vessels are mi- nutely dispersed, but from which no Excretory Diicts have been discovered to pass out. ^.j It possesses little Sensibility in the sound state; and what it does possess is considered by the latest Authors

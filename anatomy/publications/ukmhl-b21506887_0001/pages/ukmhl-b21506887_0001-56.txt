36 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part 1. Behind each internal Angular Process, a small Pit, to which the Cartilaginous Pulley of the Superior Oblique Muscle of the Eye is fixed. The Temporal Fossce^ behind the Temporal Pro- cesses, for lodging part of the Muscles of that name. The Opening between the Orbitar Processes, for re- ceiving the Cribriform plate of the Ethmoid Bone. The Foramen Supra-orhitarium, a little to the inner side of the middle of each Superciliary Ridge, through which a branch of the Ocular Artery, and part of the Ophthalmic Branch of the Fifth Pair of Nerves, pass to ithe soft parts of the Forehead. In some Skulls, the Vessels and Nerves are lodged in Furrows on the Surface of the Bone. Frequently, instead of a Hole, a Notch only is seen, the Vessels and Nerves then passing over the Superci- liary Ridge ; or two Holes in one side, and one in the other, &c. The Foramina Orbit aria Interna, Anterius et Pos- teriuSy sometimes called Foramina Etlimoidea, between the Orbitar Plates of the Frontal and Ethmoid Bones. They are about three-fourths of an inch distant from each other, and are occasionally found entirely in the Frontal Bone. Through the Anterior a small Twig of the first part of the Fifth Pair of Nerves, with an asso- ciate Artery from the Ocular, passes to the Nose. The Posterior transmits a small Branch of the Ocular Ar- tery to the same part. Besides these, there are some- times other Foramina Orbitaria Interna, which also give passage to Twigs of the Ocular Artery to the Nose. Small Perforations are found upon the under and fore part of the Frontal Bone, for the transmission of

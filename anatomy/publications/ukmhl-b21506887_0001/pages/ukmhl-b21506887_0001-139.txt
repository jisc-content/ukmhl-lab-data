Part I.] OF THE BONES. 117 The posterior Extremity of the first Rib, articulated only with the first Vertebra of the Back. A Jlat Surface upon the upper part of this Rib, v/here the Subclavian Vessels and Nerves pass over it to the Arm. The Fossa for the Intercostal Vessels and Nerve wanting at the edge of this Rib, on account of their running at a distance from this part of the Bone. The anterior Extremity of the first Rib united to the Sternum at nearly right angles, and its Cartilage so short, so firmly fixed, and so frequently ossified, as to be only moved with the Sternum. The Cartilages of the two under True Ribs, and three upper False Ribs^ commonly joined to each other by cross Cartilages, or by a union of substance, though sometimes this union takes place among a smaller number than that mentioned above. The Cartilage of the eighth Rib sometimes joined to the Sternum, and then forming one of the True Ribs. The Head of the eleventh Rib, having no Tubercle for articulation, being only loosely joined to the Trans- verse Process. The twelfth Rib much shorter than the rest. Its Head is only joined to the twelfth Vertebra of the Back. It has no Tubercle, nor articulation with the Transverse Process ; neither has it any Fossa at its under edge, the Vessels and Nerve running sbme way below it. The Anterior Eoot7'emities of the eleventh and twelfth Ribs, not joined to each other, nor to any other Rib, but lying loose among the Muscles ; hence these Ribs sometimes named Fhating Ribs. The substance of the Ribs, like that of the Verte-

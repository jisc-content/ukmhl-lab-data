50 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The thickness of the Bones varies much in different parts of the Cranium ; in a transverse section about its middle height, the Bones are about one-fifth of an inch in thickness, except at the Temples, where they are thinner, and at the Front and Occiput, where they are thicker. This thickness is understood to be in the prime of life; in youth and old age, the Bones are considerably thinner, in the former case not hav- ing attained their full growth, and in the latter, part of them having been absorbed. In the Skulls of old subjects, the Diploe are often so obliterated, that scarcely any vestige of them can be seen. In certain diseased bones, on the contrary, the Di- ploe are of a great thickness, while the Tables of the Skull are thin like paper. The Cranium is generally composed of eight Bones; six of which are said to be proper to the Cranium, and two common to it and the Face. The six proper to the Cranium are. The Os Frontis^ placed in the fore part of the Cra- nium. The two Ossa Parietalia, placed in the upper and lateral parts of the Cranium. The tzvo Ossa Tempora, placed in the under and lateral parts.

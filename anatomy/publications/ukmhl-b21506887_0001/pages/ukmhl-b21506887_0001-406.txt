346 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part III, freely to every side, but also possesses a considerable degree of motion upon its own axis. Ligaments, &c. of the Joint of the Elbow. The Capsular Ligament, which arises round the Margin of the Articular Surface, at the lower end of the Os Humeri, and is fixed about the edge of the Ar- ticular Surface of the Ulna, and also to the Coronary Ligament of the Radius. The sides of the Elbow-Joint are strengthened by two Ligamentous Bands, which adhere so firmly to the outer Surface of the Capsular Ligament, that they ap- pear to be part of its Substance, viz. The Brachio-Ulnar, or Internal Lateral Ligament, which arises from the fore part of the inner Condyle of the Os Humeri, and spreads out, in a radiated man- ner, to be fixed to the inside of the Coronoid Process of the Ulna, The Brachio-Radial, or External Lateral Ligament, which is like the former, but larger. It arises from the External Condyle of the Os Humeri, and is ex- panded upon the Coronary Ligament, into which it is inserted. The Coronary, Annular, or Orbicular Ligament of the Radius, which approaches to the firmness of Carti- lage. It arises from one side of the small Semilunar Ca- vity of the Ulna, and after surrounding the Neck of the Radius, is fixed to the other side of that Cavity. The upper edge of it is incorporated with, and may be con- sidered as a part of the Capsular Ligament, while its

Part I.] OF THE BONES. 55 The Nasal Plate, extending downwards and forwards from the base of the Crista Galli, to form the upper and back part of the Septum Narium, or Partition of the Nostrils. The greater part of this Process is very thin, but to- wards its anterior and under edge it becomes thicker^ for its firmer junction with the Bones and middle Car- tilage of the Nose. It is frequently bent a little to one side; in such cases, the two Nostrils become unequal in size. The Ethmoid Cells, sometimes termed Labyrinth, of an indeterminate number, size, and form, placed under, the Cribriform Plate, a little to the outside of the Na- sal Lamella, separated from each other by thin Parti- tions, and serving the same purposes as the Frontal Sinuses. Their communications with each other, with the open- ing of the Frontal Sinuses of the corresponding side, and also with the Cavity of tlie Nose. The OsSpongiosumSuperius, on each side, projecting inwards and downwards into the Cavity of the Nose, from the Ethmoid Cells, at the side of the Nasal La- mella, and serving for enlarging the Organ of SmelL The Triangular Form, and thick Spongy Texture of each at its under edge. Its convexity towards the Septum, and concavity out- wards. In the Quadruped, this Bone is convoluted like a Shell, or a Turban; hence, in the Human Species, as well as in Quadrupeds, it is frequently ^called Con- cha, vel Os Turbinatum.

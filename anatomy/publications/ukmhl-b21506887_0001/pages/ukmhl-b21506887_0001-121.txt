Part I.] OF THE BONES. 99 Spinous Processes in different Bones, and consequently of the length of the complete part of the Spinal CanaL The two inferior Spinous Processes commonljJhrJcedy the parts not meeting behind into a Spine, but leaving between them the opening already mentioned, for the under end of the Cauda Equina. Sometimes the whole Spinous Processes are wanting. Four Pair of Large Holes on the anterior Surface of the Bone, at the end of the Lines already described, and superficial Grooves running out from the Holesj \ for the Passage of the Sacral Nerves. The Holes become smaller as the Bone descends, cor- responding with the Nerves which pass through them. Four pair of Holes on the posterior Surface, not much smaller than those seen anteriorly, but so filled with Cellular Substance, and covered with Membranes in the recent Body, as only to admit small Nerves tQ pass out to the Muscles on the back part of this Pelvis, and minute Arteries to enter the Cauda Equina. At the root of each superior Oblique Process, ante- riorly, an impression made where the Lumbar N^ve passes out. A Notch at the under end of each side of the Bone, or a Hole common to it and the Os Coccygis, for the passage of the last Spinal Nerve. The Substance of the Os Sacrum, like that of the other Vertebrae, is very spongy, and covered only by a thin external Plate; this, however, is rendered consi- derably stronger, by a Ligamentous Membrane which adheres to it. The connexion of this Bone above to the last Lum- bar Vertebra, in the same manner as the other Verte- G S

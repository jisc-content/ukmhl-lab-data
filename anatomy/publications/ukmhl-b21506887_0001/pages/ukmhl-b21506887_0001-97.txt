75 Part I.] OF THE BONES. The conneooion of the Os Palati to the Palate-Plate of the Maxillary Bone, by the Transverse Palate Su- ture ;—to the Maxillary Bone, at the side of the Nose and bottom of the Orbit, by the Palato-Maxillary Su- ture ;—to the Pterygoid Process of the Sphenoid Bone, by the Sphenoid Suture ;—to the Os Planum and Eth- moid Cells, by the Ethmoid Suture ;—and to its fel- low, by the Longitudinal Suture. The Palate Bone forms part of the Palate, Nose, and Orbit, covers a share of the Ethmoid, Sphenoid, and Maxillary Sinuses, gives origin to part of the Azygos Uvulae, to a portion of the Pterygoideus Externus, and insertion to part of the Circumflexus Palati. In a Foetus, the Palate Bone is complete, but there are no cells in the Orbitar Processes. OssA Spongiosa, vel Turbinata Inferiora, vel Concha Inferiores. The Situation of each Spongy Bone, projecting in the under part of the side of the Nose. Its triangular Jbrm and spongy appearance, resem- bling the Os Spongiosum Superius. Its convexity toward the Neptum Nasi, and cmicavity outwards. The under edge placed horizontally near the under part of the Nose, more or less convoluted, of consider- able thickness and strength, and ending in a thin sharp point behind. The two Processes at the upper part of the Bone, the anterior ascending and forming part of the Lacrymal Groove, and the posterior descending in form of a

366 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part III. The Ligaments which run from the edge of the Bony Arch and Spinous Process of one Vertebra to that of the next, so as to assist in filling up the Interstices, and in fixing the Vertebrse together. A Ligamentous Cord which fixes the Points of the Spinous Processes together. The Cervical Ligament, termed Ligamentum Nuchce, vel Colli, which arises from the perpendicular Spine of the Occipital Bone, and descends on the back part of the Neck, adhering to the Spinous Processes of the Cervical Vertebrae, and giving Origin to part of the Trapezius. Ligaments between the Transverse Processes of the Vertebrae of the Back, fixing these Processes to each other. The Capsular Ligaments, which join the articulat- ing Processes to each other. The Posterior or Internal Common Ligament of the Vertebras, somewhat similar to the anterior one. It begins at the anterior edge of the Foramen Mag- num, and passes along the inner or concave part of the Bodies of the Vertebrae, becoming broader over each of the Intervertebral Substances. It adheres firmly to the upper and under edges of the Bones, and ter- minates at the lower part of the Os Sacrum. It pre- vents the Spine from being too much bent forwards. Ligaments of the Ribs. The Capsular Ligaments of the Heads of the Ribs, which arise from these Heads, and are fixed to the Cir- cumference of the Pits in the sides of the Bodies of the

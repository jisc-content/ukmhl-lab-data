Part I.J OF THE BONES. 35 Its external Surface convex above, and smooth, be- ing little impressed by muscular action. The external and internal Angular^ or Orhitar Pro- cesses, forming part of the Orbits. The Swperciliary Arches, or Ridges on which the Supercilia or Eye-brows are placed, extending between the external and internal Angular Processes on each side, and giving attachment to part of the Occipito- frontalis and Corrugatores Superciliorum. Projections, generally seen above the inner ends of the Superciliary Ridges, indicating-the situation of the Cavities called Frontal Sinuses. The Nasal Process, placed between the internal An- ^ gular Processes, and forming part of the Nose. It is thick and strong, and much serrated where it supports the Nasal Bones. Part of the Temporal Process, or Ridge, on each side, behind the external Angular Process, which forms the boundary between the Temporal and Frontal Mus- cles. The Orhitar Processes, or Plates, which, contrary to the rest of the Bone, are hollow below, and extend a considerable way back, to form the upper parts of the Orbits for lodging the Eyes and their Appendages. They are remarkably smooth below, and are render- ed so thin by the pressure of the Brain and Eye on the opposite sides, that they become transparent, and the Cancelli, especially in old people, are obliterated. The Sinuosity at the upper part of the Orbit, be- hind the outer end of the Superciliary Ridge, on each side, for lodging the Lacrymal Gland. c ^

Part I.] OF THE BONES. 105 the attachment of one of the Flexors of the Thigh, termed Iliacus Internus^ and the support of a portion of the Intestinum Ilium and Colon. A Passage in the Venter, near its under part, and another in the Dorsum towards its anterior region, for the principal Medullary Vessels of the Bone. Besides these, different Foramina are seen, of less consideration, for admitting Vessels into the Substance of the Cancelli. A Depression at the inside of the anterior-inferior Spinous Process, where the Flexor Muscles of the Thigh, viz. the Iliacus Internus and Psoas Magnus, pass, with the anterior Crural Vessels and Nerve. The Linea Innominata^ vel Linea Ilio-pectinea, at the under part of the Venter of the Bone, forming the lateral portion of what is termed Brim of the Pelvis, and the line of division between the Pelvis and Abdo- men. Into the Iliac Portion of the Linea Innominata, the Tendinous Expansion continued from the Psoas Parvus is inserted. The inner and hack part of the Bone, rough and very irregular, the posterior portion of this irregular surface projecting behind the Os Sacrum, and giving origin to some of the large Muscles of the Back; the middle being for the attachment of Ligaments which go to the Os Sacrum, and the anterior for the firm connexion which subsists between this Bone and the Cartilage which glues it to the Os Sacrum. The circumference of this rough and irregular sur- face gives attachment to the Capsular Ligament of the Joint. The undery fore, and outer part of the Bone, form-.

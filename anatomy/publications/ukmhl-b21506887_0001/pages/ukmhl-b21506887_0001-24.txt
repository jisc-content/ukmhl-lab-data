In living Animals, they are of a bluish colour, in consequence of the Blood contained in their small Vessels appearing through their Surface. Lamellae, or Plates of the Bones. Bones are composed of Lamellce, or Plates, which are formed of, Fibres running longitAidinally, or in a radiated manner, according to the natural figure of the Bone. The lamellated structure may be seen, by exposing them to the heat of a strong fire; or to the weather; or by boiling them under an increased pressure; or by observing their exfoliations when in a diseased state. Scarpa, in a late publication, denies the lamellated structure of the Bones, and endeavours to prove that they have every where a Cellular texture. The Plates of Bones are originally formed by the Vessels of the Periosteum Externum and Membrana MeduUaris, and not, as has been supposed by some Authors, from Layers detached from the external Pe- riosteum. The Plates are connected by Fibres, which some have considered as Claviculi or Nails, and called Per- pendicular, Oblique, &c. according to their different di- rections The outer Plates of Bones are firmly compacted, so as to appear like one solid substance.

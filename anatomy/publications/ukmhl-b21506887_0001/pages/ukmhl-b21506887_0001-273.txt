Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. SIS Major Anticus, and the Muscle is commonly connect- ed with the Pectoralis Major, Intercostales, and La- tissimus Dorsi; the last of which covers the edge of a portion of it, extending from the twelfth Rib to the Spine of the Os Ilium, from the anterior half of which it has also part of its origin. From these attachments the Fibres of the Muscle run obliquely downwards and forwards, and terminate (sometimes by distinct Indentations) in a broad Ten- don, or Aponeurosis, which, near its margin, is firmly connected with the Tendon of the two following Mus- cles, where it forms a curved line, called Linea Semi- lunaris. From this the Tendinous Fibres are con- tinued in the same direction with the Fleshy Fibres, to the middle of the Abdomen. Insertion: Into its fellow of the opposite side, by the medium of ,a Tendinous Line, which extends from the Cartilago Ensiformis to the Pubis, and is known by the name of Linea Alba. The Linea Alba is formed by the meeting of the Ten- dons of the Oblique and Transverse Muscles of the op- posite sides of the Abdomen, and is perforated in the middle by the Umbilicus, originally a passage for the Umbilical Cord, and now formed into a Cicatrix. _ The Tendon of this Muscle is strengthened by other â€¢ Tendons of a more delicate nature, lying upon its outer surface. These decussate it, in a curved direction, upwards and inwards, and are intimately connected with, or take their origin from, the under end of the Tendon of the Muscle. The under part of the Tendon, thicker and stronger than the rest of it, extends from the Superior-anterior

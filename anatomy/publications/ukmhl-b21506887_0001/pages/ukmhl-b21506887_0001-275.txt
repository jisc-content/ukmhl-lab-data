Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. S15 sions of the Bowek happen here more frequently in Women. Where the cc^umns separate, a space is left, of an bval form^ or rather like the barrel of a Quill cut ob- liquely, with thes kfge end of the opening outermost. It is about an inch in length in a Male, but less in a Female, the direction running upwards and out- wards, or somewhat in a line between the Pubis and Spine of the Ilium. This is the Ring- of the EocUrnal Oblique Muscle, or Under Abdominaly or Spermatic, or Supra-pubial Ring, for the transmission of the Sper- matic Cord in a Male, and round Ligament of the Uterus in a Female, and where the Bowels protrude in Inguinal Hernia. Surrounding the exit of the Cord, or the round Li- gament from the Ring,, there is a quantity of Cellular Substance, and some Tendinous Fibres, which assist in filling up that opening, and in preventing any com- munication between the outer and inner parts. The place where the columns separate to form the Ring varies in different Subjects. In some, the separa- tion is considerably farther out than the part already described, though more generally the division is direct- ly at the outer part of the Ring. At this end of the Ring, the columns are joined by Tendinous Fibres, which arise from the Os Ilium, and from Poupart's Ligament; and are part of the Fibres mentioned above, as decussating the Tendon of the External Oblique Muscle. Through the Abdominal Ring, there is no direct opening into the Cavity of the Abdomen; the passage

S48 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. MULTIFIDUS SpIN^5 Formerly described as three distinct Muscles, viz. Transverso-splnalis Lumborum, Transverso-spinalis Dorsi, and Transverso-spinalls Colli. Origin: From the side of the Spinous Processes of the Os Sacrum, and from that part of the Os Ilium which joins with the Sacrum; from all the Oblique and all the Transverse Processes of the Dorsal, and of the four inferior Cervical Vertebrae, by as many dis- tinct Tendons, which soon become Fleshy, and run obliquely upwards and inwards. Insertion: By distinct Tendons, into all the Spi- nous Processes of the Lumbar, Dorsal, and Cervical Vertebras, excepting the Atlas. Action : To extend the Spine obliquely, and pull it to a side. W^hen both Muscles act, they draw the Spine directly backwards. Semi-Spinalis Colli, Vel Transmrso-spinalis Colli. Origin : From the Transverse Processes of the six uppermost Dorsal Vertebrae, by an equal number of distinct Tendons, which run obliquely under the Com- plexus. Insertion: Into the Spinous Processes of all the Cervical Vertebrae, except the first and last. Action I To extend the Neck obliquely backwards, and to a side.

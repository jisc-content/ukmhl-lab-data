Part I.] OF THE BONES. 19 When Ossification is about to begin in a particular part, the Arteries, which were formerly of the Serous kind, become dilated, in consequence of a greater de- termination of Blood to them, and receive now the red Blood from which the Osseous matter is secreted. This matter retains, for some time, the form of the Vessels, which give it origin, till, more Arteries being by de- grees dilated, and more Osseous matter deposited, the Bone at length attains its complete form. Some Bones are completely formed at the time of Birth, as the small Bones of the Ear. The generality of Bones, however, are incomplete until the age of puberty, or between the fifteenth and twentieth year, and in some few instances not until a later period. In Children, the greater number of Bones have Epiphyses or Appendices ; these, in Adults, become Apophyses or Processes which spring directly from the body of the Bone. The Epiphyses begin to appear after the Body of the Bone is ossified, and are themselves ossified at seven or eight years of age, though their external surface is still somewhat Cartilaginous. In the early period of life, the Body and Ends of long Bones make three distinct parts^ each of which has its centre of Ossification, and the parts can readily be separated by boiling, or by maceration in water. The Epiphyses are joined to the Body of the Bone by Cartilages, which are thick in Children, but gra- dually become thinner, in consequence of absorption, as Ossification advances, till at last, in the Adult, the external marks of division are not to be seen ; though B 9.

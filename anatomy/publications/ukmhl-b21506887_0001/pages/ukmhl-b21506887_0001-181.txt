Part I.] OF THE BONES. 15^ joined at their under extremities by a union of sub- stance. * The Fibula affords attachment to Muscles; assists in securing the articulation of the Foot; adds. to the form and strength of the Leg; and, by the head of the Bone being fixed to that of the Tibia, it widen» the space for the Interosseous Ligament. The Fibula gives origin to the Peronei Longus, Brevis, et Tertius, Extensor Proprius Pollicis, and Flexor Longus Pollicis,—to part of the Extensor Lon- gus Digitorum, of the Soleus, and Tibialis Posticus, —Insertion to the Biceps Flexor Cruris. In a Foetus, the extremities of the Fibula are Car- tilaginous, and afterwards become Epiphyses, previous- ly to being united to the Body of the Bone. Patella, vel Rotula, or Knee-]^n. The Patella, placed at the fore part of the Joint of the Knee, and in some jespects bearing the same rela- tion to the Tibia as the Olecranon does to the Ukia. The shape of the Patella, triangular or fiat, or of the Figure of a Heart as painted upon playing-cards, and having its point downwards. The anterior Surface of the Bone, convex, and per- forated by numerous Holes for the insertion of Ten- dons and Ligaments which cover it. posterior Surface, which corresponds with the Trochlea of the Os Femoris, smooth, covered with Car- tilage, and divided by a longitudinal prominent Ridge into two unequal-sized Cavities, of which the external is the largest, like the Trochlea, to which it is adapted.

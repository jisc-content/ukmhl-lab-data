Part I.] ^ OF THE BONES. 9 Lymphatics of the Bones. y Bones, like other parts, have their Lymphatics, as appears by the Absorption of Madder deposited in the substance of the Bones of Animals receiving it with their Food; by the absorption of part of the Bone itself, when in a diseased state; by the absorption of Bone as a person advances in life ; and even by Injec- tion. Nerves of the Bones. The Nerves of the Bones are small, but may be ob- served in certain parts of them, accompanying the prin- cipal Arteries; and it is presumed they exist in all. From the minuteness of the Nerves, and rigidity of the parts on which they are dispersed, Bones are not sensible in the sound state; and even in the diseased, the pain felt may be owing to the Membranes within them. Chemical Analysis of Bones. The component parts of Bones are, an Earthy Mat- ter, Cartilage, Gelatin, and Marrow, and these vary- ing in proportion in different persons, in different Bones of the same person, and in the same Bone at different ages. The Earthy Matter, however, bears the largest proportion; but this is less in Children than in persons of more advanced life.

Part I.] OF THE BONES. IBS The lower end, also marked by the insertion of seve- ral Muscles. The Cartilaginous Trochlea at the under and fore part of the Bone, placed obliquely, with its outer Sur- face larger and higher than its inner one, to be adapt- ed to the Knee-bone which moves upon it. The eocternal and internal Condyles^ continued back from the Trochlea, and also covered with Cartilage, for the motion of the Tibia. The internal Condyle, larger and deeper than the ex- ternal, to compensate for the obliquity of the Thigh, and to give less obliquity to the Leg. A Notch between the back part of the Condyles, for lodging the Popliteal Vessels and Nerves. A semilunar rough Notch, deeper and lower than the former one, for the attachment of the Crucial or inter- nal Ligaments of the Knee. The inner substance of this Bone, like that of other long Bones, consists of a fibrous reticular texture in the middle, and lamellated Cancelli at the extremities. The Body of this Bone has remarkably thick and strong solid sides; but these, towards the ends, become al- most as thin as a piece of paper. The Thigh-bone is articulated above with the Os In- nominatum, which allows the free motion of the Body - of the Bone in all directions. It is restrained, however, in its motion outwards by the Ligamentum Rotundum, and the high Brim of the Acetabulum. The Head and Neck of the Bone can move round their own axis, though its Body possesses little rotatory motion. In consequence of the oblique situation of the

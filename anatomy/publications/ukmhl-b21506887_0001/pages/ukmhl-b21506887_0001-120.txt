98 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part L Bone^ facing backwards, to correspond with ^the two inferior Processes of the last Lumbar Vertebra. A large Ohiong Process on each side of the Bone, formed by the concretion of the outer ends of all the original Transverse Processes. The upper lateral parts of the Bone, which corre- spond with the three superior Transverse Processes, divided into two irregular Cavities on each side, by a perpendicular Ridge, The anterior of the two Cavities lined with Cartilage, Ifrhich glues this Bone to the Os Ilium, and in such a manner as not to allow any motion. The Cartilage which unites these Bones to each other is remarkably thin, but adheres so intimately to the Os Sacrum, that in separating that Bone from the Ilium, the Cartilage commonly comes with it, leaving the Ilium quite bare. The posterior Cavity, rough, and irregular, divided into two, by a Transverse Ridge formed by the union of the Oblique Processes ; and in a recent Subject, full of Ligamentous Fibres and Cellular Substance, which are included in the general Capsular Ligament, and which also assist in fixing this Bone to the Os Ilium. The portion of this Process formed by the three up- permost Transverse Processes, remarkably thick and strong, while that belonging to the two last is much smaller, but irregular behind, where it gives attach- ment to the Ligament termed Sacro-sciatic. Of the Spinous Processes, the three uppermost com- monly distinct, but remarkably shori;: There is a great variety, however, in the number and appearance of the

A Depression between the Glenoid Fissure and Sty- loid Process, for lodging a portion of the Parotid Gland, The Thimhle-like Cavity, or Jugular Fossa, at the inner side of the root of the Styloid Process, and under and back part of the Pars Petrosa, for lodging the top of the internal Jugular Vein.

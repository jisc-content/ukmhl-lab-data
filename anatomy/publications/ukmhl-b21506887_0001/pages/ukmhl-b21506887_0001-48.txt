28 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The General Figure of the upper part of the Cra- nium is compared to that of an Egg. The medium length of it appears to be about six inches and a half, and the greatest transverse diameter, which is a little behind the External Auditory passages, about five inches. The Cranium is of a flat form at its sides, partly by the action of the Temporal Muscles. The flatness of this part of the Head is found to in- crease the sphere of vision, and to give a more advan- tageous situation for the Ears, that they may receive a greater quantity of sound, while they are less expos- ed to danger. The Surface of the upper and outer part of the Cra- nium is smooth, where it is little affected by Muscles, and is covered by the Periosteum common to all the Bones, but in the Skull termed Pericranium. The under and outer Surface of the Cranium is ir- regular where it gives attachment to Muscles, &c. and passage to Vessels and Nerves. The anterior and under portion of the Cranium is hollow^ to make part of the Orbits. The posterior Surface of the Cranium is mar'ked by the insertion of Muscles arising from the back part of the Trunk. The upper and inner Surface of the Cranium is lioL low^ for lodging the Brain. The under and inner Surface of the Cranium has many unequal Cavities^ for lodging the Lobes and Ap- pendages of the Brain and Cerebellum, and for allow- ing passage to the Vessels and Nerves of the Encephar Ion in general.

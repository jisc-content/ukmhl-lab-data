140 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paet I. The inner Surface of the Bone, articulated with the Os Cuneiforme. The Os Cuneiforme, or Wedge-shaped Bone, or Os Teiquetrum, less than the former Bone, and si- tuated on its inner side. The anterior Edge, tliin, in form of a wedge. The upper and outer Surface, articulated with the Os Lunare. The upper part forms a sliglit convexity, which is included in the Joint of the Wrist. Here the move- able Cartilage already taken notice of, is interposed be- tween this Bone and the Ulna. The under and outer Surface, articulated with tlie Os Unciforme. The anterior and inner Surface, forming a slight coii^ nexity for its articulation with the Os Pisiforme. The three first Bones of the Carpus form an oval convexity, by which they are articulated with the lower end of the Bones of the Fore-arm ; the Ossa Scaphoides and Lunare being received in the Socket formed by the Radius, while the Os Cuneiforme is opposed to the Car- tilaginous end of the Ulna. By this kind of articidation, extensive motion is allow- ed forwards and backwards, and to each side ; and by a succession of these motions, the Hand is made to move in a circle ; but no motion is performed by the Carpus round its own axis, except what it has along with the Radius in the Supination and Pronation of the Hand. The Os Pisiforme, vel Orbiculare, the least of the Carpal Bones, placed upon the anterior and inner Sur-

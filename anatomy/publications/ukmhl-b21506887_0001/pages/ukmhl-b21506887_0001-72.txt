52 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part L A curved Fossa, at the root of the posterior Surface of the Pars Petrosa, and opposite to the Mastoid Pro- cess, for lodging the Lateral Sinus, where it turns down- wards to go out of the Cranium. In this Fossa the passage is observed which corresponds with the Fora- men Mastoideum. This Cavity is frequently larger in one Temporal Bone than in the other, which happens in cases when the Lateral Sinuses are of unequal size. The Meatus Auditorius Internus, vel Foramen Au~ ditwum, passing outwards and backwards, in the pos- terior Surface of the Pars Petrosa, for the passage of the Seventh Nerve, and the principal Artery belonging to the Inner Ear. In the bottom of this passage there are many Fora- mina ; one above, more conspicuous than the rest, is the beginning of the passage for the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair of Nerves. The others are the pas- sages of the Branches of the Portio Mollis of that Pair. Some way below the Meatus Internus, is the open- ing of the passage, termed, by Cotunnius, Aquceductus Cochlece ; and near the same distance behind the Mea- tus, and on the same side of the Bone, is the mouth of the Aquceductus Vestihidi. The Foramen Innominatum, near the middle of the Anterior Surface of the Pars Petrosa, and leading back- wards, for the passage of the Vidian Nerve, which is reflected from the Second Branch of the Fifth, to the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair. The Orifice of the Cancdis Caroticus appearing at the outer and fore part of the Pars Petrosa. - The Foramen Jugulare, vel Foramen Lacerura Pos-

S88 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. Gluteus Maximus, vel Sacro-femoralis. Origin : Fleshy, from the back part of the Spine of the Os Ilium ; from the under and outer part of the Os Sacrum; from the Os Coccygis; and from the posterior Sacro-sciatic Ligament, over which part of the infe- rior edge hangs in a Flap. The Fibres are collected into coarse Fasciculi, which run obliquely forwards and a little downwards. The upper part of it covers almost the whole of the Trochanter Major, and it is intimately connected with the broad Tendon of the Tensor Vagi- nae Femoris. This Muscle is the largest of the Body, and composes the principal part of the Buttock. Insertion : By a strong, thick, and broad Tendon, into the upper and outer part of the Linea Aspera, along which it is continued for some way down. Action : To extend the Thigh, and pull it backwards and a little outwards. It extends also the Pelvis on the Thigh in standing ; and, assisted by the other Glutei, maintains the equilibrium of the Body on the lower Extremity, which rests on the ground, while the other is carried forwards, as in walking. Gluteus Medius, vel Ilio-trochantereus Magnus. Origin: Fleshy, from all that part of the Spine of the Os Ilium which is unoccupied by the Gluteus Maxi- mus; from the upper part of the Dorsum of that Bone; and from an Aponeurosis which covers the Muscle, and joins the Fascia of the Thigh. It sends off a broad Tendon, which has its

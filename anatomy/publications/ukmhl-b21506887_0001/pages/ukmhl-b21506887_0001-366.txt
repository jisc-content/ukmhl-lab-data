806 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Fart Flexor Longus Digitorum, Vel Flexor Profundus, vel Flexor Perjbrans, vel Tibio- phalangeus Communis. Origin: By an acute Tendon, which soon becomes Fieshy, from the back part of the Tibia, at the under edge of the Popliteus; and this Origin is continued down the inner edge of the Bone, by short Fleshy Fi- bres ending in a large Tendon. It arises also by 'I'en- dinous and Fleshy Fibres, from the outer edge of the Tibia; and between this double order of Fibres, ihq Tibialis Posticus lies inclosed. After going under two Annular Ligaments behind the inner Ankle, it passes, through a Sinuosity at the inside of the Os Calcis; and about the middle of the Sole, receives a Tendon from the Flexor Longus Pollicis. It then divides into four Tendons, which run through the slits of the Per- foratus. Insertion : Into the Base of the third Phalanx of the four smaller Toes; the Tendons of this, as well as of the Flexor Brevis, being inclosed upon the Toes by Annular Ligaments. Action: To bend the different Joints, particularly the last one of the Toes. Flexor Digitorum Accessorius, Vel Massa Carnea Jacobi Sylvii. Origin: By two Portions; the inner Fleshy, from the Sinuosity of the Os Calcis; the outer Tendinous,

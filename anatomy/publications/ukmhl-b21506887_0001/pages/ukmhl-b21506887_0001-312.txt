252 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II, Interspinales Colli. The spaces between the Spinous Processes of the Cervical Vertebrae, most of which are forked, are oc- cupied by double Fleshy Portions. Origin : From the upper part of each Spinous Pro- cess. Insertion : Into the under part of each Spinous Pro- cess, immediately above that from which the Muscle takes its origin. miction: To draw these Processes nearer to each other, and of course the Neck a little backwards. Intertransversales Colli. The spaces between all the Transverse Processes of the Cervical Vertebrae, which are also forked, are filled up in like manner with double Fleshy Portions. Action : To draw these Processes towards each other, and turn the neck a little to one side. Interspinales et Intertransversales Dorsi. These are rather small Tendons than Muscles, serv- ing to connect to each other the Spinous and likewise the Transverse Processes. Interspinales Lumborum. They are of the same nature with the Interspinales and Intertransversales Dorsi.

^44 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. third, fourth, and fifth Ribs, under the upper and back part of the Scapula. Action : To elevate the Kibs, and thus to dilate the Thorax in violent Inspiration. Sacro-Lumbalis, vel Sacro-costalis. Origin: In common with the Longissimus Dorsi, Tendinous without, and Fleshy within, from the side and all the Spinous Processes of the Os Sacrum; from the posterior part of the Spine of the Os Ilium; and from all the Spinous and Transverse Processes of the Lumbar Vertebrae. The common Head fills up the space between the Os Ilium and Os Sacrum, and also the Hollow of the Loins. At the under part of the Thorax, the Muscle begins to send off Tendons, which are of considerable length, and lie flat upon the Ribs. Insertion: Into the angles of all the Ribs, by an equal number of Tendons. From six or eight of the Lower Ribs arise an equal number of Fleshy Portions, which terminate in the inner side of this Muscle, and get the name of Musculi Accessoriif vel Additamentum ad Sacro-lumhalem. Action: To assist in raising and keeping the Trunk of the Body erect. It also assists the Serratus Infe- rior, and Quadratus Lumborum, in depressing the Ribs during laborious Expiration. From the upper part of this Muscle, a Fleshy Slip, called Cervicalis Descendens, runs up to be fixed to the Transverse Processes of the fourth, fifth, and sixth Cervical Vertebrae, by three distinct Tendons. It turns the Neck obliquely backwards to one side.

116 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part L Peculiarities of the Ribs. The first Rib tlie most crooked; from this downwards the Ribs become gradually straighter. The uppermost Ribs approaching nearest to the ho- rizontal situation ; their obliquity, with respect to the Spine, increasing as they descend, and their anterior extremities becoming more distant from each other. The Cartilages of the Ribs, like the Ribs themselves, becoming gradually longer from the first to the seventh, but, contrary to what happens in the Ribs, approach- ing nearer to each other in their descent. The length of the Ribs, increasing from the first to the seventh, and then decreasing to the twelfth. The distance between the Heads of the Ribs and their angles, increasing to the ninth Rib, correspond- ing with the breadth of the Sacro-lumbalis which co- vers them. The seven uppermost Ribs having their Cartilages, joined to the Sternum, and opposed to the Heart and Lungs, considered as the Custodes, or Guards of Life^ hence termed True Ribs. The five inferior, not reaching the Sternum, termed False Ribs. The Cartilages of the YalseWihs, shorter as they de- scend, and more flexible than those of the True Ribs. The first Rib placed in a horizontal situation, with one of the flat sides facing upwards, and the other downwards, in consequence of which one of the edges is turned outwards, and the other in the contrary di- rection.

g54 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. Muscles, acting exclusively of their fellows; viz. the Sterno-mastoideus, upper portion of the Trapezius, the Platysma Myoides, upper part of the Splenius, the Trachelo-mastoideus, Complexus, Obliquus Inferior, and Rectus Posticus Major. The Neck, from the Vertebra Dentata downwards, is mo\edi—forwards, by the Longi Colli;—hackwards, by the Rhomboidei Minores, Serrati Postici Superiores, Splenii Colli, Cervicales Descendentes, Transversales, Semi-spinales et Interspinales Colli, and upper part of the Multifidi Spinse;—laterally^ by the Muscles upon the anterior and posterior parts of the Neck acting on one side, and these assisted by the following, which are chiefly situated upon the lateral parts of the Neck, viz. the Levator Scapulae, Scaleni Anticus, Medius, et Pos- ticus, and Inter transversales Colli. The Trunk is moved, and chiefly at the Loins,— Jbrwards^ by the Psoae Magnae et Parvi, Quadrati Lum- borum, by the Recti, Pyramidales, Obliqui Externi, Obliqui Interni, et Transversales Abdominis ;—hack- wards, by the Sacro-lumbales, Longissimi, Spinales et Semi-spinales Dorsi, Multifidi Spinae, Interspinales Lumborum ;—laterally^ by the Muscles mentioned a^ bove, upon the anterior and posterior parts of the Trunk acting upon one side, and these assisted by the Quadra- tus et Intertransversales Lumborum ;—twisted, by the Obliquus Externus Abdominis, Serratus Posticus In- ferior, Semi-spinalis Dorsi, by the Dorsal and Lumbar part of the Multifidus Spinae, on one side assisted by the Obliquus Internus Abdominis, Sacro-lumbalis, and liOnEgissimus Dorsi of the other side;—kept erect, by the

Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES 195 MUSCLES ON THE FORE and LATERAL PART OF THE NECK. Platysma Myoides, vel Cutaneus, vel Thoraco- facialis. Origm: By a number of separate Fleshy Slips, from the Cellular Substance, which covers the upper parts of the Pectoral and Deltoid Muscles.—In their ascent, they unite to form a thin Muscular Expansion, which runs obliquely upwards along the fore and lateral part of the Neck, adhering to the Skin, and is similar to the Cutaneous Muscle of Quadrupeds. Insertion : Into the side of the Lower Jaw and the Depressor Anguli Oris, and into the Skin which covers the under parts of the Masseter, and Parotid Gland. Action : To assist in depressing the Lower Jaw, the Corner of the Mouth, and the Skin of the Cheek ;— when the Jaws are shut, to raise all that part of the Skin connected with it under the Lower Jaw. Sterno-Cleido-Mastoideus, vel Sterno-mastoideus. Origin : From the top of the Sternum, and the an- terior end of the Clavicle, by two distinct Heads ; the first of which is round, tendinous, and a little fleshy ; the other broad and fleshy. A little above the Cla- vicle, the two Heads unite to form a strong Muscle, which runs obliquely upwards and outwards; the great- er part of it being covered by the Platysma Myoides. N 2

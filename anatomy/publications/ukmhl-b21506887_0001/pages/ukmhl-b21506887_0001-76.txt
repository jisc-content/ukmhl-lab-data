56 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOxMY. [Part I. large share of the Ethmoid Cells, and forming the greater part of the inner sides of the Orbits. On the upper edge of the Os Planum, two small Notches appear, which, with similar Notches in the Frontal Bone, form the Internal Orbitar Holes. The Substance of the Ethmoid Bone is the thinnest of any of the Bones of the Cranium, the Ossa Plana, and parts which form the Ethmoid Cells, being as thin as writing-paper, and extremely brittle. It differs, be- sides, from almost every other Bone in the Body, in its Sides or Walls being formed of single Lamellae, with scarcely any Medullary Cells, the Crista Galli ex- cepted. The connexion of the Cribriform Plate to the Orbi- tar Plates of the Frontal Bone by the Ethmoid Suture; and to the Sphenoid Bone by a Suture common to the two Bones, but generally considered as belonging to the latter. The connexion of the Ossa Plana to the Orbitar Plates of the Frontal Bone, by part of the Transverse Suture. The jposterio7- edge of the Nasal Plate, joined to the Processus Azygos of the Sphenoid Bone. Its upper edge, joined to the Nasal Processes of the Frontal and Nasal Bones. Its anterior edge, joined to the middle Cartilage of the Nose. The Ethmoid Bone assists in sustaining the Anterior Lobes of the Brain, gives passage to the Olfactory Nerves, attachment to the Falx, forms a large portion of the Organ of Smelling, and of the inner sides of the Orbits, but has no Muscles attached to it.

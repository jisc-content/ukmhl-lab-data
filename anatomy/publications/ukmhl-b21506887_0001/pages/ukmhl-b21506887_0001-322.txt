COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pakt H. MUSCLES SITUATED CHIEFLY ON THE ARM, SERV- ING FOE THE MOTION OF THE FORE-ARM. Aponeurosis of the Superior Extremity. The greater part of the Superior Extremity is co- vered by a Tendinous Membrane or Aponeurosis, which arises from the Muscles, and from the different Processes of the Bone of the Shoulder. It covers the two Spinati Muscl'es on the back part of the Scapula, as already mentioned. On the Humerus, it incloses the Flexor and Exten- sor Muscles of the Fore-arm, and is connected to the Ridges and Condyles at the under end of the Os Hu- meri. At the bending of the Elbow, it is attached to the ends of the Radius and Ulna, and receives considera- ble additions from the Tendons of the Biceps and Tri- ceps of the Fore-arm, where the Fibres from the op- posite sides decussate each other. It becomes thicker and stronger on the Fore-arm, and forms a firm covering to the Muscles there. In its descent, it gives origin to many Muscular Fi- bres, and sends off among the Muscles, partitions which are fixed to the Radius and UJna. The Mem- brane is at length lost insensibly upon the Hand. It is thicker and stronger on the back than upon the fore side of the Extremity, particularly on the Fore- arm, at the under and back part of which it forms a

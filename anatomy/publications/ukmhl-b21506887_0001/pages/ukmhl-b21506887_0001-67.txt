Part I.] OF THE BONES. 47 The conne/vion of the Bone to the Ossa Parietalia, by the Lambdoid Suture. The Occipital Bone protects the under and back part of the Brain, gives origin on each side to the Occipito- frontalis, to part of the Trapezius, Constrictores Pha- ryngis Superior et Jnfei'ior; insertion to the Recti Capitis Antici Major et Minor, Rectus Capitis Late- ralis, Complexus, Recti Capitis Postici Major et Minor, Obliquus Capitis Superior, and to part of the Sterno- cleido-mastoideus and Splenius. In a Foetus, the Occipital Bone is divided into Jour pieces, viz. the Occipital, two Lateral or Condyloid, and the Basilar; the first, which is by much the largest, forms all the part of the Bone above the Foramen Mag- num ; the second and third are placed at the sides of that Foramen, and constitute almost the whole of the Condyles; and the fourth forms the Cuneiform Process. OssA Temporum. In these we observe, The situation of each Temporal Bone in the under and lateral part of the Cranium. The Squamous Plate, which forms a part of the Temple, and gives origin to a portion.of the Temporal Muscle. The Squamous Plate appearing equal and smooth externally, with a thin semicircular edge above, which, by overlapping the under edge of the Parietal Bone, gives name to this Process. The Mastoid or Mammillary Process, at the under and back part of the Bone, of various form and size.

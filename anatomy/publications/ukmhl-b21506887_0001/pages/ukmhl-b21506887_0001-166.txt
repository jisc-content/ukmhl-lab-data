144 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The extremities of these Bones, considerably larger than their Bodies, in consequence of which they leave spaces for the Interossei. The upper Ends or Bases, flat, where they are arti^ culated with the Bones of the Carpus. Round the edges of the Cartilaginous Surfaces, at the upper ends, the Depressions where the Capsular ] ligaments are fixed. The sides of the upper ends flat, and drawn close together, where they are articulated with each other. Their Bodies diverging towards their under extremi- ties, by which they regulate the motions of the Fingers. A Ridge at the upper and back part of their Bodies, with a Depression on each side of it, formed by the Interossei. The under and back part of their Bodiesj-made flat, by the motion of the Tendons of the Extensors of the Fingers. The anterior Surface of their Bodies concave, and and renderedat the sides, by the Interossei. The lower Ends, or Heads, formed into Balls, which are flattened at their sides, by their motions upon each other. At the fore part of each side of the Heads, a little Prominence, for the attachment of the Ligaments which fix these Bones to each other. Round the Heads, a Depression, for the insertion of the Capsular Ligaments. The Metacarpal Bones are joined by their Bases to the Carpus, and to each other by nearly plain Sur- faces ; in consequence of which, and the strength of

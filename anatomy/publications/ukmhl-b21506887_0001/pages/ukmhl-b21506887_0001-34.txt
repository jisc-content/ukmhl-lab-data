14 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. as belonging rather to its Membranes than to the Mar- arowi iti^el£r > Nerves cannot be detected in the Marrow ; but that this part of the Body is not without Nerves, seems to be proved by the experiments made on the Marrow when the Bones of living animals are cut, and by the pain a person frequently suffers from Diseases within the Bones. - ; Jj.x li. . u . ; Marrow,^accordi^lg^^to•thVEx'|^^ of Berze- Lius, consists of pure Marrow, with a very small pro- portion of Skins of Blood-Vessels, Albumen, Gelatin, Extractive Peculiar Matter, and Water. The Marrow answers the several purposes to the Bones which the Fat does to the other Organs. Ac- cording to SoEMMERRiNG, the usc of the Marrow is to render the Bones comparatively lighter; but the real use of this substance is probably not y^t suffi- ciently known, nr.fll ro-fbiln Cartilages. Cartilages are of a white colour, of an elastic nature, and much softer than Bones, in consequence of the smaller quantity of Earth entering their composition. Their Structure is not so evidently Fibrous as that of Bones, yet by long Maceration, or by tearing them asunder, a Fibrous disposition is perceptible. Their Vessels are extremely small, though they can be readily injected in Cartilages where Bone is begin- ning to be formed. The Vessels of the Cartilages of the Joints seem entirely to exclude the red Blood. No

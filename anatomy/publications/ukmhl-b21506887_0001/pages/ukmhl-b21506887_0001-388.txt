They are composed of Fibres variously disposed; the greater part of them, however, running in a longi- tudinal direction. The Ligaments of moveable Joints arise, for the most part, at the junction of the Bodies of the Bones with their Epiphyses, from the Cervioj, and beyond the edges of the articulating Cartilage of one Bone, and are fixed, in a similar manner, into the correspond- ing parts of the Bone adjoining.

216 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paet II. being shut by the Obliquus Internus and Transversa- lis Abdominis, and by the Fascia Transversalis. Action of the Obliquus Externus: To support and compress the Peritoneum and Bowels of the Abdomen; to assist in the evacuation of the Faeces and Urine, and in the exclusion of the Foetus; to thrust the Diaphragm upwards, and draw down the Ribs in Expiration; to bend the Body obliquely to one side when a single Muscle acts, and directly forwards when both act; and to raise the Pelvis when the Thorax is fixed. Obliquus Ascendens Internus, Vel Obliquus Internus Abdominis^ vel Ilio-abdominalis. Origin : From the back part of the Os Sacrum ;— from the Spinous Processes of the three lowest Lumbar Vertebrae, by a Tendon common to it and the Serratus Posticus Inferior and Latissimus Dorsi;—from the whole length of the Spine of the Os Ilium ;—and from the inside of Poupartes Ligament, at the middle of which it sends off the Cremaster. From these Origins the Fibres are disposed in a radiated manner ; but the greater part of them run in a slanting direction upwards. At the Linea Semilunaris, the Muscle becomes Ten- dinous, and adheres firmly to the Tendon of the Obli- quus Externus. Here its Tendon divides into two. Layers: the anterior Layer, with the greater part of the inferior portion of the posterior Layer, joins the Ten- don of the External Oblique, and goes over the Rectus,, to be inserted into the Linea Alba. The posterior Layer joins the Tendon of the Transversalis, and goes , behind the Rectus; and this union is continued down.

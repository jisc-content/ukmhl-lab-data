16 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. tion of them than* of Bones is destroyed by the action of fire. They are softened by Maceration in water; and the Articular Cartilages, by long boiling, are in a great measure dissolved. They are found to consist chiefly of Albumen and Water, with a small proportion of Phosphate of Lime. One set of Cartilages supply the place of Bone or by their flexibility, admit of a certain degree of motion, while their elasticity recovers their natural po- sition ;—as in the Nose, Larynx, Cartilages of the Ribs, Cartilages supplying Brims to Cavities, he. Another set, in Children, supply the place of Bone, until it is formed, and afibrd a Nidus for the Osseous Fibres to shoot in ;—as in the long Bones of Children, A third set, the most extensive, by the smoothness and slipperiness of their surface, allow the Bones to move readily, without any abrasion ;—as in the Abdu- cent or Articular Cartilages, By their elastic nature, they render the motions easier, and lessen the concus- sion in the more violent motions of the Body, as run- ning, jumping, &c. They also prevent the inordinate growth of Bones at their articulating surfaces, and the coalescence of the Fibres of adjoining Bones. A fourth set supply the oflice both of Cartilage and Ligament, giving the elasticity of the former, and flexi- bility of the latter; uniting some imnioveably together, and allowing to others a small degree of motion ; as in the Cartilages of the Bones of the Pelvis and Spine. Cartilages are divided by some Anatomists into two Sets, viz. Temporary and Permanent. The first in- cludes those in which Bone is formed in the Child; the

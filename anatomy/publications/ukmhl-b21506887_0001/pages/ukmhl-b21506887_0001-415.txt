Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS. 855 it is covered by the Iliacus Internus ; and thinnest pos- teriorly, where the adjacent Quadratus is opposed to it. It is strengthened on its outer Surface by various Jc- cessory or Additional SUps^ which run down from the Fascia Lata and surrounding Muscles ; but the strong- est of these Slips arises with diverging Fibres from the inferior-anterior Spinous Process of the Os Ilium. The Capsular Ligament allows the Thigh-^bone to be moved to every side ; and when its Body is brought forwards or backwards, a small degree of rotation is performed by the Cervix of the Bone, round its own axis. The Internal^ commonly called the Round Ligament, which arises by a broad flat beginning from the under and inner part of the Cavity of the Acetabulum, and is connected with the Substance termed Gland of the Joint. From this it runs backwards and a little up- wards, becoming gradually narrower and rounder, to be fixed to the Pit upon the inner Surface of the Ball of the Os Femoris. The Round Ligament prevents the Bone from being dislocated upwards or inwards, and assists in agitating the Mucous Substance within the Joint. A Cartilaginous Ligament surrounding the Brim of the Acetabulum, and thereby increasing the depth of the Cavity for the reception of the Head of the Thigh- bone. A Double Cartilaginous Ligament, stretched from one end of the Breach in the under and fore part of the Acetabulum to the other, but leaving a Hole behind it for containing part of the Substance called Glmid of

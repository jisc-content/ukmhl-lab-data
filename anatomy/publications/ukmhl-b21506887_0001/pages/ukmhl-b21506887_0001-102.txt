80 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. Opposite the Alveoli, the external Plate swelling, and giving a fluted form, which is observed in the whole extent of the Alveolar Process of the Upper Jaw, and in the fore part of the Lower Jaw. At the fore part of the Jaw, the Alveoli are perpen- dicular, but turn inwards behind, where they are placed nearer the inner than the outer part of the Jaw. The Sockets are worn down by absorption in old age, in consequence of which the Teeth drop out, the Jaw becomes narrower, the face shorter, and, when the Mouth is shut, the Jaw appears more prominent. The posterior Maxillary Foramen^ at the roots of the Condyloid and Coronoid Processes, upon the inner side of the Jaw, for the passage of the Third, or infe- rior Maxillary Branch of the Fifth Pair of Nerves, with the corresponding Blood-vessels, into the Bone. A small-pointed Process at the inner edge of this Hole, where a Ligament goes off to be fixed to the Temporal Bone. Above the Hole, the Bone marked by the passage of the Nerve and Vessels; and below it, commonly a small Furrow^ pointing out the course of a Branch of this Nerve which goes to the Mylo-hyoideus and the Sublingual Gland. Between the Posterior Maxillary Foramen and the Angle, the Bone marked by the insertion of the Inter- nal Pterygoid Muscle. The Anterior Maxillary Foramen^ or Mental Hole^ at the side of the Chin, where the remains of the In- ferior Maxillary Nerve and Vessels come out. The Inferior Maxillary Canal, running in the sub- stance of the Bone, between the Posterior and Ante-

146 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The motion is something greater than that of the former Bone. The Metacarpal Bone of the Little-finger^ the small- est of the four. The Base, which slants downwards and outwards, opposed to the under and inner part of the Os Unci- forme. The inner part of the Base destitute of a smooth surface, not being contiguous to any other Bone. From the nature of the Joint, the looseness of the Ligaments, and from the existence of a proper Muscle here, this Bone possesses a larger share of motion than any of the rest. It has inserted into it the Extensor Carpi Ulnaris, and Adductor Minimi Digiti. Metaxarpal Bone of the Thumb, The Metacarpal Bone of the Thumb^ having the ge- neral resemblance of those of the Fingers, but differ- ing from them in being placed obliquely with respect to them, and in some measure opposing them. This Bone thicker and stronger, but shorter than any of those of the Fingers. The Base of this Bone articulated with the Pulley formed by the Trapezium, the Bone appearing to admit of flexion and extension only; but, from the looseness of the Ligaments, possessing the same kind of motion with Joints formed after the manner of Ball and Socket. The ififerior extremity of the Bone considerably flat- ter than those of the other' Metacarpal Bones. This Bone gives Origin to part of the Abductor In>

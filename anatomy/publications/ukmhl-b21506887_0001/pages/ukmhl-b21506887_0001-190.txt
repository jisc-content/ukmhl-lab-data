168 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. Round the Heads distinct Impressions, where the Capsular Ligaments are fixed. The Metatarsal Bones in general give Origin to the Interossei. The Metatarsal Bone of the Great Toe, by much the thickest and strongest, but shortest of the Metatarsus. The articulating Cavity of its Base, deeper than the rest. The anterior Extremity, bearing a greater proportion to the Base than the rest, having a much larger share of the weight of the Body to sustain here, and formed into a middle Prominence, with tivo lateral Depressions, where the Bones termed Ossa Sesamoidea move. It gives Origin to part of the Transversalis Pedis.â€” Insertion to part of the Tibialis Anticus, of the Pero- neus Longus, and Adductor Pollicis. The Metatarsal Bone of the first of the Smxill Toes, the longest of the five. The Metatarsal Bone of the Middle Toe, the second in length, with a Base like that of the former Bone, triangular, but a little larger, to be articulated with the Os Cuneiforme Externum. The Metatarsal Bone of the third of the Small Toes, nearly of the same length as the former, but distin- guished from it by its Base being thicker below, and its Cartilaginous Surface being more of a square form, corresponding with the anterior and inner part of the Os Cuboides, with which it is articulated. The Metatarsal Bone of the Little Toe, the shortest of those of the Small Toes, with flat Surfaces facing upwards and downwards. It gives Insertion to the Peronei Brevis et Tertius,

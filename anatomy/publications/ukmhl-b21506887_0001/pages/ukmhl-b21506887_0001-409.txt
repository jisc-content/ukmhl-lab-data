Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS. S49 Ligaments, &c. between the Fore-arm and Wrist. The Capsular Ligament^ which arises from the Mar- gin of the Glenoid or Navicular Cavity of the Radius, and from the edge of the moveable Cartilage at the Head of the Ulna, and is fixed to the Cartilaginous edges of the three first Bones of the Carpus. The Inter-articular Cartilage, placed between the Head of the Ulna and Os Cuneiforme, and which is a continuation of the Cartilage covering the end of the Radius. It is concave above and below, and is connect- ed loosely to the end of the Styloid Processes of the Ulna. The two Lateral Ligaments, one of which arises from the Styloid Process at the under end of the Radius, and is fixed to the Os Naviculare; and the other from the Styloid Process of the Ulna, and is fixed to the Cunei- form and Pisiform Bones. The Ligaments of this Joint allow extensive motion forwards and backwards, and a considerable degree of it to either side. The Mucous Ligament, which lies within the Joint, and extends from the Groove between the two first Bones of the Carpus, to the corresponding part of the Radius. It is supposed to regulate the Mucous Or- gan connected with it. Ligaments of the Carpus. The Anterior, Annular, or Transverse Ligament, which is stretched across from the projecting Points of the Ossa Pisiforme and Unciforme, to the Scaphoides

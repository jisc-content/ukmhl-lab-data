256 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. MUSCLES OF THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. Pectoralis Major, see p. 233.—Pectoralis Minor, see p. 234.—Subclavius, see p. 234.—Serratus Magnus, see p. 235.—Trapezius, see p. 240.—Latissimus Dorsi, see p. 241.—Rhomboideus, see p. 242.—Levator Sca- pulae, see p. 247. Motions of the Scapula. The Scapula is moved—upwards^ by the Trapezius, Levator Scapulae, Rhomboideus, and Omo-hyoideus; —downwards^ by the Trapezius, Serratus Magnus, Pectoralis Minor, Subclavius, and occasionally through the medium of the Humerus, by the Latissimus Dorsi, and Pectoralis Major forwards aud downwards, by the Serratus Magnus, Pectoralis Minor, Subclavius, and occasionally by the Pectoralis Major;—hacTiwards, by the Trapezius, Rhomboideus, and occasionally the Latissimus Dorsi;—moved obliquely upwards or down- wards, by the above Muscles, according to their diffe- rent situations.—By a succession of these motions, the

138 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. HAND. The Hand, composed of the Bones of the Carpus, Metacarpus, and Fingers. The posterior Surface of the Hand, convex, which gives it a greater degree of strength. The anterior Surface of the Hand, concave, for grasping and holding substances. Caepus, or Wrist. The Carpus is composed of eight Bones, disposed in two Rows; each Bone being broader on its posterior than anterior Surface, they form an Arch convex be- hind, by which it gives security and strength ; and con- cave before, for containing the Muscles, Vessels, and Nerves, which run to the Fingers. The ends of the Arch on the Palm-side of the Wrist, form projecting Points, between which the Ligamentum Carpi Annulare is stretched, which confines the Mus- cles in their places. The posterior or convex Surface of the Carpus, marl^- ed by the numerous Ligaments attached to it. The anterior or hollow Surface, also marked by Li- gaments. The Bones of the Carpus are articulated with each other, or with the neighbouring Bones, and all their articular Surfaces are covered with Cartilage, to facili- tate the motion of the Joints.

Above, it is covered by the Pleura, and below, by the Peri- toneum ; and is commonly divided into two portions, called Superior or Larger, and Inferior or Smaller Muscles of the Diaphragm Superior, or Greater Muscle of the Diaphragm. Origin : By Fleshy Indentations, from the Gartila- go Ensiformis, and from the Cartilages of the Seventh, and of all the inferior Ribs on both sides. From these different Origins, the Fibres run in a radiated manner. Insertion : Into a Cordiform Tendon, placed in the middle of the Diaphragm, in which the Fibres of the opposite sides are interlaced.—Towards the right side, the Tendon is perforated by a triangular Hole for the passage of the Vena Cava Inferior; and to the upper convex part of it, the Pericardium and Mediastinum are connected. Inferior, or Lesser Muscle, or Appendix of the Diaphragm. Origin: By four pair of Heads, of which one Pair in the middle, commonly called its Long, or Tendinous Crura, is the longest. The long Crura arise from the fore part of the fourth Lumbar Vertebra, and adhere to the Bodies of all the Vertebrae of the Loins above this, by the intervention of the Ligamentum Commune Aiit^Bai Cbveringj these Bones.

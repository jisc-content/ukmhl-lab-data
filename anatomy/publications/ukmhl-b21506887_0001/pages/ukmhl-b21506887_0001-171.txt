Part I.] OF THE BONES. U9 The Jirst Bone like the Bones of the first Phalanx of the Fingers, but thicker and stronger. The Cavity at the Base of the Bone, longer from " one side to the other, and shallower than the Cavities of the corresponding Bones of the Fingers, but, like them, forming a Socket for the Metacarpal Bone. From the flatness of the Joint, however, and strength of the lateral Ligaments, the motions here are confined to flexion and extension only. The lower end of the first Bone of the Thumb like that of the first of the Fingers. It gives Insertion to the Extensor Primi Internodii, Abductor et Adductor Pollicis,â€”and to part of the Flexor Brevis Pollicis. The second Bone of the Thumb like the third of the Fingers, but broader. The Base of this Bone, like that of the second and third Bones of the Fingers, and like their Joints also, admitting of flexion and extension only. It has inserted into it the Flexor Longus, et Exten- sor Secundi Internodii Pollicis. The substance of the Bones of the Metacarpus, and of those of the Fingers and Thumb, is the same with that of the long Bones. In a Foetus, both extremities of the Metacarpal Bones, and of the first and second Phalanx of the Fingers, and first Bone of the Thumb, are in a state of Cartilage ; as are also the upper ends of the third Phalanx of the Fingers, and second Bone of the Thumb.

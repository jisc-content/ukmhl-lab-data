Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS. 347 under edge is fixed round the Neck of the Radius, al- lowing that Bone to move freely round its own axis, upon the Articular Surface of the Os Humeri, and in a smaller Semilunar Cavity of the Ulna. Besides the Ligaments already described, there are others which run in various directions upon the fore and back parts of the Joint, contributing to its strength, and having the names of Anterior and Posterior Acces^ sory Ligaments, There are also two Tendinous Substances, termed Inter-muscular Ligaments of the Os Humeri, which ex- tend along the under and lateral parts of the Bone, giving Origin to a portion of the Muscles situated at this part of the Arm. The Ligaments and Bones of the Joint of the Elbow form a complete Hinge, which allows the Fore-arm to have free flexion and extension upon the Os Humeri, but no rotation when the Arm is in the extended state, though a small degree of it is perceptible when the Joint is moderately bent, and the Ligaments thereby relaxed. Within the Capsular Ligament, and chiefly in the upper part of the Pit of the Os Humeri in which the Olecranon plays, the Fatty Substance is lodged for the lubrication of the Joint. A similar Substance, but much smaller, is also found in the Depression in which the Coronoid Process of the Ulna moves. I

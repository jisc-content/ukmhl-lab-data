552 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Paet III. Ligaments retaining' the Tendons of the Muscles of the Hand and Fingers in situ. The Anterior, Transverse, or Annular Ligament of the Wristâ€”already described. The Vagi7ial Ligaments of the Flexor Tendons, which are fine Membranous Webs connecting the Ten- dons of the Sublimis, first to each other, then to those of the Profundus, and forming, at the same time, Bur- sas Mucosae, which surround these Tendons. The Vaginal or Crucial Ligaments of the Phalanges, which arise from the Ridges on the concave side of the Phalanges, and run over the Tendons of the Flexor Muscles of the Fingers. Upon the Body of the Pha- langes, they are thick and strong, to bind down the Tendons while their Muscles are in action ; but over the Joints they are thin, and have, in some parts, a Crucial appearance, to allow the ready motion of the Joints. The Accessory Ligaments of the Flexor Tendons of the Fingers, which are small Tendinous FrcBna, arising from the first and second Phalanges of the Fingers. They run obliquely forwards within the Vaginal Liga- ments, terminate in the Tendons of the Two Flexor Muscles of the Fingers, and assist in keeping them in their places. The External Transverse, ov Posterior Annular Liga- ment of the Wrist, which is part of the Aponeurosis of the Fore-arm extending across the back of the Wrist, from the inner side of the extremity of the Ulna and Os Pisiforrae, to the outer end of the extremity of the Ra-

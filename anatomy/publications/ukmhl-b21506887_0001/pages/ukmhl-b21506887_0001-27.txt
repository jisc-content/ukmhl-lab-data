Many minute Orifices are observed upon the surface, and particularly in the Furrows of Bones, for the trans- mission of Blood-vessels into their substance. Near the middle of iriost of the Bones, especially the long ones, there is a slanting" Canal for the passage of the principal Medullary Vessels, which consist of Ar- teries and Veins. Numerous Orifices, some of them very considerable in size, are observed'at the extremities of long- Bofies. Some serve for the transmission of Blood-vessels, and others for giving attachment to the Fibres of the Liga- ments of the Joints. The principal Vessels pass into the Cancelli, inter- nal Membranes and Marrow, and return to the solid substance of the Bone, where they meet those sent in- wards from the Periosteum. * ; a , :.'. ; , â–  Some Jiat Bones, as those of the 0ra!mum, are en- &ely supplied from the Vessels of the surrounding Membranes, and the Vascularity there is uniform. liln a subject, the ^rferi^^ of the Bones, and some- ftmes the Veins^i csLti be shewn by a successful Injection thrown into them; but the latter are more readily;

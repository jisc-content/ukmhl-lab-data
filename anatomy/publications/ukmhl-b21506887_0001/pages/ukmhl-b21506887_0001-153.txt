Part I.] OF THE BONES. 131 for the origin of the strong Flexor Muscles of the Hand and Fingers. The Surface at the under end of the Bone, between the Condyles, covered with Cartilage for the articula- tion with the Bones of the Fore-arm. The oblique Situation of the articulating Surface, the inner end being lower than the outer, by which the Hand turns more readily to the Face, or the upper parts of the Body. The inner part of the articulating Surface, consist- ing of a large internal and small external Eminence, with a middle Cavity, or a Trochlea or Pulley, upon which the Ulna moves. The outer part of the Articular Surface, upon which the Head of the Radius plays, of a round form, and <jonsidered by some Authors as the smooth part of the outer Condyle. Round the edge of the Articular Cavity, the Bone marked by the insertion of the Capsular Ligament of the Joint. A small Cavity at the under and fore part of the Bone, above the Trochlea, for receiving the Coronoid Process of the Ulna in the flexion of the Fore-arm. A large Cavity at the under and back part of the Bone, also above the Trochlea, the under part of it for receiving the Olecranon of the Ulna in the exten- sion of the Fore-arm, and the upper part for contain- ing the Fat of the Joint. Between these Cavities the Bone is pressed so thin as often to become transparent, especially in an old person. The Substance and inner Structure of the Os Hu- 1 2

19S COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. MUSCLES OF THE LOWER JAW. Aponeurosis Temporalis. This is a strong Tendinous Membrane, proper to be taken notice of before describing the Temporalis. It arises from the Bones which give origin to the upper semicircular part of the Temporal Muscle, and, de- scending over it, is fixed to the whole upper edge of the Zygoma. Use : To brace the whole, and to give origin to part of the Temporal Muscle. Temporalis, vel Temporo^maxillaris. Origin: Semicircular and fleshy, from the lower half of the Parietal Bone, and Temporal Fossa of the Frontal and Cheek Bones; and from the Squamous part of the Temporal, and Temporal Plate of the Sphe- noid Bones.—It arises likewise from the Aponeurosis covering it.—From these Origins the Fibres descend like Radii, and the Muscle sends off" a strong Tendon, which passes under the Zygoma. Insertion: Into the whole of the Coronoid Process of the Lower J aw, which it incloses as in a sheath, and is continued to near the last Dens Molaris. Action: To pull the Lower Jaw upwards, and a little backwards against the Upper Jaw.

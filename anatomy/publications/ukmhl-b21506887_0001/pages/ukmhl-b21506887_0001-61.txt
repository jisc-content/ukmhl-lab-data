Part I.] OF THE BONES. 41 In the progress upwards, the Furrows divide into many Branches, and frequently small passages are seen' running from these into the Diploe. The depression at the upper edge of the Bone, for the attachment of the upper part of the Falx, and lodgment of part of the superior longitudinal Sinus. This is most distinctly seen when the Bones are con- joined. The depression for the longitudinal Sinus, like the Sinus itself, becomes larger in its course backwards ; and frequently it is larger in one Bone than in the other. The Fossa at the under and back part of the Bone, for lodging a small part of the lateral Sinus. Numerous, though slight depressions, found on the inside of the Bone, especially below, occasioned by the prominences of the Brain. Near the attachment of the Falx are observed, in many Skulls, Pits, varying in size and number, for lodging the Glands of Pacchioni. The Parietal Bones have the two Tables and Diploe the completest, and are the most equal and smooth of any of the Cranium. They serve as Walls to protect the upper and lateral parts of the Brain, and give ori- gin to part of the Temporal Muscles and their Apo- neuroses. The connexion of the Parietal Bones to the Os Fron- tis by the Coronal, and to each other by the Sagittal Suture. In a Foetus, the sides of the Parietal Bones are incomplete, and there is no Parietal Hole. Between the Parietal Bones and the middle of the divided Os

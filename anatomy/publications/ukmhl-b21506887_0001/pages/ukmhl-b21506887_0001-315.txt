Fae'tII.] of the muscles:. C5MO 255 Muscles upon the fore and back parts of the Trunk, acting as antagonists to each other. By making the Head, or the upper part of the Trunk, the fixed point, the same motions may be per- formed, and by the same Muscles, as when the Pelvis is fixed, or when the lower part of the Trunk is in its natural situation ; but the Muscles draw the moveable parts in direct opposition to those formerly moveable ; and the Muscles which in the natural situation rolled the Head, with the Atlas, on the Vertebra Dentata, or twisted the other parts of the Spine, act now also in a contrary direction. The same circumstances hold good with respect to the Extremities.

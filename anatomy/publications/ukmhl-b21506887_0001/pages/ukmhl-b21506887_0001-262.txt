202 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. former, but, like it, has nearly the same Origin, Inser- tion, and Action. Stylo-Pharyngeus. Origin : From the root of the Styloid Process ;—it goes downwards and forwards. Insertion: Into the side of the Pharynx, along which it expands.—It is also fixed to the back part of the Thyroid Cartilage. Action: To dilate and raise the Pharynx, and there- by prepare it to receive the Food from the Mouth. It at the same time elevates the Thyroid Cartilage. ' CiRCUMFLEXUS PaLATI, Vel Tensor Palati, vel Pterygo-palailnus. Origin : From the Spinous Process of the Sphenoid Bone, from the Osseous and Cartilaginous parts of the Eustachian Tube, and from the root of the Internal Pterygoid Process. It runs along the Pterygoideus In- ternus, passes over the Hook of the internal Plate of the Pterygoid Process ; and playing on it by a round Tendon, as on a Pulley, it spreads out into a broad Membrane. Insertion: Into the Velum Palati, and semilunar edge of the Os Palati, extending as far as the Suture which joins the two Bones. Generally some of its pos- terior Fibres join the Constrictor Pharyngis Superior and Palato-pharyngeus. Actio7i: To depress and stretch the Velum laterally

S2 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The Sagittal Suture is sometimes continued through the middle of the Frontal Bone to the Nose. This is said to be more frequent in Females than in Males. Upon examining a great number of Crania, the Author found it taking place in one out of nine or ten. The serrated appearance of the True Sutures is seen distinctly on the outside of the Cranium only; on the inside, the Bones appear almost to be joined in straight lines. In some Skulls, the internal Surface is found entire, while the Sutures are manifest without; the inner Plates meeting and coalescing sooner than the outer. As a person advances in life, the True Sutures be- gin to be obliterated, first on the inner, then on the outer side, till in very old age not a vestige of one of them is to be seen. The two False, called also Temporal Sutures, placed a little above the Ear, between the upper edge of the Temporal, and under edge of the Parietal Bones. Each of the Portions of the False Sutures, situated between the upper and back part of the Parietal, and the upper and back part of the Temporal Bones, is called by some Additamentum SuturcB Squamosce, and has in that part the true serrated appearance. Besides the Squamous Sutures here taken notice of, it is to be observed, that the term Squamous is also ap- plied to all the Sutures on which the Temporal Mus- cle is placed; it therefore includes part of the Coronal ^nd Sphenoid Sutures. Sometimes, though rarely, there is a double Squa^ mous Suture, dividing the scaly part of the Bone into two unequal portions.

The Tibia gives Origin to the Tibialis Anticus, and Flexor Longus Digitorum,â€”to part of the Extensor Longus Digitorum, Soleus, and Tibialis Posticus. In- sertion to the Sartorius, Gracilis, Semi-tendinosus, Se- mi-membranosus, Popliteus, and through the medium of the Patella, to the Extensors of the Leg. The Extremities of the Tibia are Cartilaginous in a Foetus, and become afterwards Epiphyses. Fibula, vel Os Perone. The Fibula, placed at the outer side of the Tibia, where the Fibula, or Clasp, was formerly used, by much the smaller of the two Bones, being the most slender, in proportion to its length, of any in the Body. The upper end of the Fibula, formed into a large Head, with a Superficial smooth Cavity towards its in- ner side, to be articulated with the Tibia, where it is tied by Ligaments of such strength as to allow very little motion. The Head of the Fibula, irregular and rough ex- ternally, for the insertion of the Biceps Flexor Cruris, and of the External Lateral Ligament of the Knee. The Body of the Bone bent a little inwards and backwards, and unequall}^ triangular above, but some- what quadrangular below, with the Surfaces between the Angles marked by the Muscles which arise from it, or are placed upon it.

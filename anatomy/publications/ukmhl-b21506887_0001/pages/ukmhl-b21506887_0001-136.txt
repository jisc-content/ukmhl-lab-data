114 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. Their Figure, cmiveoc externally, by which their strength is increased ; and concave and smooth inter- nally, with their flat sides turned towards the Lungs, which they protect. The Head of each Rib, formed into a Ridge and ^two hollow Surfaces covered with Cartilage, to be ar- ticulated with the Bodies of two Vertebrae, and their intermediate Cartilage. Round the Head, the Bone spongy, for the attach- ment of the Capsular Ligament of the Joint. The Tubercle of the Rib, at a little distance from its Head, and placed posteriorly, with aflat Cartilaginous Surface and irregular Edge, to be articulated to the Transverse Process of the undermost of the two Verte- brae, to which the head of the Rib is joined. The Cervioo of the Rib, between its Head and Tu- bercle, of a roundish form. Another small Tubercle in most of the Ribs, at the outer side of the former, for the attachment of Liga- ments which fix the Ribs to each other, and to the Transverse Processes ; and also for the insertion of the outer Slips of the Longissimus Dorsi. " Beyond the Tubercle, the Rib rendered Jlat behind, by the Sacro-lumbalis. The Angle of the Ribs to which the Sacro-lumbalis is fixed, where the Bones are about to bend, to form the lateral part of the Thorax. The Rib becoming broader and flatter at the lateral part of the Thorax, and the flat Surface opposed to the Lungs. The upper Edge of the Rib, round where the inter- costales are fixed.

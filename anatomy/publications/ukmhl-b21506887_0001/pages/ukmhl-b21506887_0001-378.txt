318 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part III. Or where the Bones play on each other, as between the Clavicle and Coracoid Process of the Scapula. Some of the Bursas of contiguous Tendons commu- nicate with each other, as between the Extensor Carpi Radialis and Extensor Secundi Internodii Pollicis. Others communicate, not only in Adults, but often also in Children, with the Cavity of the Joints, as be- hind the Tendon of the Extensors of the Leg ; though this is more frequently the case in advanced age. The Bursas in general are either of a roundish or oval form, from which they have been arranged under two classes, viz. the Spherical and Vaginal. Their structure is the same with that of the inner Layer of the Capsular Ligament of the Joints. Like that, they are formed of a thin Pellucid Serous Membrane, possessing little sensibility in the sound state, and joined to the surrounding parts by Cellular Substance, which, in many places, is intermixed with Fat. Like the Capsule of the Joint, they have commonly a thin Layer of Cartilage, or of tough Membrane, be- tween them and the Bone. Like it, they have reddish-coloured Masses of Fat, projecting into their Cavities, from the edges of which Fringes are sent off; as behind the Ligament of the Patella, or at the insertion of the Tendo Achillis. Like it also, the inside of the Bursas is remarkably smooth, being lubricated with the same kind of Gelati- nous Fluid which is found in the Cavities of the Joints, and which serves the same general purpose with that of the Joints, viz. to lessen friction, and prevent the consequences which would otherwise result from it.

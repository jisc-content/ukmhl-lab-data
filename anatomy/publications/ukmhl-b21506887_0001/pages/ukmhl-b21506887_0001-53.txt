Part I.] OF THE BONES. 33^ In the Sutures of the Cranium there are often Ad- ditional Bones, called Ossa Triquetra^ from their being of-a triangular form, and Ossa Wormiana, from Wor- Mius, who, though not the discoverer, gave a descrip- tion of them. The Ossa Wormiana vary much in figure, size, and number, and are occasionally found in the different Sutures, though most frequently in the middle of the Lambdoid. Wherever they occur, the Sutures surrounding them are observed to be similar to the neighbouring Sutures; of course they are equally with them distinguished from Fractures of the Skull. Their formation is considered to be owing to an in- crease in the number of the points of Ossification, or to a deficiency in the Ossification of the ordinary Bones of the Cranium; in which last case, separate Ossifica- tions begin in the unossified interstices. Between the Bones of the Cranium and those of the Face, five Sutures are also found, and they are said to be common to these two sets of Bones. Parts, how- ever, of these Sutures, lie only between the Bones of the Cranium. The Sutures here are. The Ethmoid Suture^ which surrounds the Ethmoid Bone- The Sphenoid Suture, which surrounds the Sphenoid Bone. The Ethmoid and Sphenoid Sutures in some parts assist in forming other Sutures, especially the Squa- mous and Transverse ; and in other parts, there is but one Suture common to these two Bones. The Transvei'se Suture, which runs across the Or- VOL. I. c

No Nerms can be traced to them ; nor do they pos- sess any sensibility in the sound state. Yet the Gra- nulations which rise on the surface of Cartilages, after Amputation at the Joints, are very sensible. Upon their surface there is a thin Membrane, termed Perichondrium, from its covering the Cartilages, which in Cartilages supplying the place of Bone, as in those of the Ribs, or at the ends of the long Bones in Chil- dren, is a continuation of the Periosteum, and serves, the same general purposes to Cartilage as the PerioSr teum does to Bone. . The Perichondrium of Cartilages which supply the place of Bone, or by their flexibility possess a degree of motion, has Blood-vessels, which, like those of the Periosteum, can be injected. But the Vessels of this Membrane belonging to other Cartilages, particularly that covering the Articular ones, cannot be injected. Upon the surface of Articular Cartilages, the Peri- chondrium is a Reflection of the inner surface of the Capsular Ligament, and is so very thin^ and adheres so closely, as to appear like part of the Cartilage itself. They have no internal Cavity, nor Cancelli, nor in^ ternal Membrane, for lodging Marrow; their weight is nearly a third less than that of Bone. Their Texture is less changed by acids ; but a much greater propor-

156 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. ner angle, and giving origin to part of the Muscles which extend the Foot and bend the Toes. A fiat Surface above the Ridge and under the head of the Tibia, indicating the situation of the Popliteus. The Canal for the Medullary Vessels, slanting down- wards at the inner and back part of the Bone, a little above its middle height. The under end of the Tibia smaller than the upper one, and its inferior surface hollow^ and covered with Cartilage, for the Articulation with the Astragalus. The Malleolus Internus^ or Mallet-like process, or Inner AnTde^ produced from the inner and fore part of the under end, and covered also with Cartilage where the Astragalus plays. A Pit in the point of the Malleolus Internus, for the attachment of the internal Lateral Ligament, and a Groove behind, where the Tendon of the Tibialis Pos- ticus is placed. The semicircular Cavity, at the under and outer side of the Tibia, for receiving the under end of the Fi- bula. Round the edge of the articular Cavity, the Bone, marTced by the insertion of the Capsular Ligament. The Tibia has a strong external Table, with a con- siderable quantity of spongy substance. The Articulation of the upper part of the Tibia with the Os Femoris, is of such a nature as to allow flexion to a great degree, but the numerous Ligaments fixed here prevent it from being extended beyond a straight line with the Thigh ; and then there is no rotation nor lateral motion, though, when the Joint is bent, the Li- gaments are so much relaxed that the Leg may be made

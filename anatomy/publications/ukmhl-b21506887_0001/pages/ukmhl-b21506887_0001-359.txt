Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. 299 ris, and from a little above the Condyle, by two sepa- rate beginnings: The other, Tendinous, from the upper and back part of the external Condyle. A little below the Joint, their Fleshy Bellies meet in a middle Ten- don, the union behind giving the appearance of a lon- gitudinal Raphe. Below the middle of the Tibia, the Muscle sends off a broad thin Tendon, which, becom- ing gradually narrower, joins that of the Gastrocne- mius Internus, a little above the Ankle. Gastrocnemius Internum, Vel Soleus, vel Tibio-calcaneus. Origin : By two Heads. The first from the back of the Head, and upper and back part of the Body of the Fibula: The other from the back of the Ti- bia, running inwards along the under edge of the Popliteus, towards the inner part of the Bone, from which it receives Fleshy Fibres for some way down, and forms a Muscle, which is of the compound Penni- form kind. This is covered by the Tendon of the Gas- trocnemius Externus, and descends. Fleshy, nearly as far as the extremity of the Tibia, a little above which, the Tendons of both Gastrocnemii unite, and form a strong round Cord, cBlled Tendo Achillis, or simply Heel Tendon. Insertion : Into the upper and back part of the Os Calcis, by the projection of which the Tendo Achillis is enabled to act more powerfully upon the Foot. Action: To extend the Foot by raising the Heel. By the Bellies of the two Gastrocnemii, but particu- larly of the Externus, the Calf of the Leg is formed.

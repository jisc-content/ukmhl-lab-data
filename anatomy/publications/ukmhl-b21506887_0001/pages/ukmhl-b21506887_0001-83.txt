Pakt I.] OF THE BONES. 63 instead of Sinuses, the Body of the Bone is composed of large Cells. The substance of this Bone is the most unequal of any in the Body, some parts being extremely thin, while others are thicker than most parts of the Cranium. The conneooion of the Bone to all the other Bones of the Cranium, by the Sphenoid Suture, though others, as the Transverse, Ethmoid, &c. are confounded with it. The Sphenoid Bone forms the middle of the Base of the Cranium, a share of the Temples, Orbits, and Nose, and assists in supporting the anterior and middle Lobes of the Brain. It gives passage to the Blood- vessels of the Dura Mater and Eye, and to the greater part of the Cerebral Nerves. It affords origin to the Levator Palpebrse, Laxator Tympani, and all the Muscles of the Eye-ball, except- ing the Obliquus Inferior ; to part of the Buccinator, Pterygoidei Externus et Internus, Temporalis, Cir- cumflexus Palati. and Constrictor Pharyngis Superior. In a Foetus, the Temporal wings are separated from the Body of the Bone by maceration, and there are no Sphenoid Sinuses. In the early period of life, the Sphenoid Bone is joined to the Cuneiform Process of the Occipital Bone by a thin Cartilage, which, by the age of fifteen or sixteen years, is in general completely absorbed, and the two Bones so firmly united by an accretion of sub- stance, or in the manner that Processes are united to the bodies of long Bones, that Dr Soemmereing has described them as one Bone, under the name oÂ£ Sphe- no-occipitale.

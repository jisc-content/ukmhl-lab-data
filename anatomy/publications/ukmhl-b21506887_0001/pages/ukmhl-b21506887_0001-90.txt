68 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. The posterior hollow Surface, for lodging part of the Temporal Muscle. The superior Orhltar Process, forming part of the outside of the Orbit. The iriferior Orhitar Process, forming part of the lower Edge of the Orbit. The Maxillary Process, forming the under part of the Prominence of the Cheek. The Arch between the Orbitar Processes, which forms near a third part of the anterior Circumference of the Orbit. The Zygomatic Process, the most conspicuous, ex- tending backwards, and becoming oblique, to join the Zygomatic part of the Temporal Bone, and with it to form an Arch over the Temporal Muscle. The Internal Orhitar Plate, hollow and extending back between the Orbitar Processes, to form a share of the outer, under, and fore part of the Orbit. A Passage through the Bone, for the transmission of small Vessels or Nerves from the Orbit to the Face, and sometimes from the Face to the Orbit. A Notch in the outer part of the internal Orbitar Process, assisting in the formation of the large Slit at the bottom of the Orbit. The substance of the Bone is thick and hard, with some Cancelli. The Connexion of the superior Orbitar Processes and internal Orbitar Plate to the Frontal and Sphe- noid Bones, by the Transverse Suture. The Connexion of the Zygomatic Process to the Temporal.Bone, by the Zygomatic Suture. The Os Malae closes the outer part of the Orbit, and

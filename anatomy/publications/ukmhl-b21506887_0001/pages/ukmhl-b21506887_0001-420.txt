306 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part III. are the largest of any in the Body, are situated in the different interstices of the Joint, but chiefly round the edges of the Patella, and especially at its under end. They are covered by a fine Membrane reflected from the inner Surface of the Capsular Ligament. F'lmhricB project from the edges of these Fatty Sub- stances, which discharge Synovia for the lubrication of the Joint, Ligaments connecting the Fibula to the Tibia. The Capsular Ligament of the superior extremity of the Fibula, which ties it to the outer part of the Head of the Tibia, and which is strengthened by the exter- nal lateral Ligament of the Knee, and by the Tendon of the Biceps which is fixed to the Fibula. The Interosseous Ligament, one edge of which is fix- ed to the Ridge or Angle at the outer and back part of the Tibia, the other to the corresponding Ridge at the inner side of the Fibula. It fills the space between the Tibia and Fibula, like the Interosseous Ligament of the Fore-arm, and is of a similar structure, being formed of oblique Fibres, and perforated in various places for the passage of Vessels and Nerves. At its upper part there is a large Opening, where the Muscles of the opposite sides are in contact, and where Blood-vessels pass to the fore part of the Leg. It serves chiefly for the Origin of part of the Mus- cles which belong to the Foot, and thereby supplies the place of Bone. The Ligaments of the inferior extremity of the Fi^

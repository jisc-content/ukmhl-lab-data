g82 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II PoUicis, and Indicator ;—moved laterally outwards, by the Flexor Carpi Radialis, Extensores Carpi Radialis Longior et Brevior, assisted by the Extensores Primi et Secundi Internodii "2oMici^'^—momdlaterally inwards, by the Flexor et Extensor Carpi Ulnaris, assisted by the Flexores Digitorum Sublimis et Profundus, and Extensor Digitorum Communis. By a succession of the above motions, the hand can move in a Circle. The Supination of the Hand is performed by the Su- pinator Radii Brevis, and Biceps Flexor Cubiti, assist- ed by the Supinator Radii Longus, and Extensor Se- cundi Internodii Pollicis ; and the Pronation by the Pronatores Radii Teres et Quadratus, assisted by the Palmaris Longus, Flexor Carpi Radialis, et Flexor Digitorum Sublimis. The Fingers are bent, at the First Joint, by the Lumbricales, Interossei, Flexores Digitorum Sublimis et Profundus, et Brevis Minimi Digiti;—at the Second Joint, by the Flexor Digitorum Sublimis, and in the Little Finger, by the Flexor Minimi Digiti;-—at the Third Joint, by the Flexor Digitorum Profundus.— Extended in all the Joints, by the Extensor Digitorum Communis, assisted in the Index by the Indicator; and when the Fingers are moved beyond a straight line with the Metacarpal Bones, the Interossei and Lumbricales then act with the common Extensor ;—moved laterally, by the Interossei, assisted in the Index by the Abductor Indicis, and in the Little Finger by the Abductor Mi- nimi Digiti;—moved in a Circle, at the first Joint, by a succession of the above motions. The Thumb, at the Root of the Metacarpal Bone, is brought towards the Middle of the Palm, by the Op po

9% COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. where the Head has its Jleooion and extension^ but little other motion. The second Vertebra, called Dentata^ from the Pro- cessus Dentatus, or tooth-like Process on the upper part of its Body. The Body of this Vertebra larger than the rest, and of a Conical figure. The fore part of the Processus Dentatus, convex, and covered with Cartilage where it turns upon the At- las. It has the same appearance behind, where it moves upon the Transverse Ligament. The Sides of this Process, marhed by the insertion of the Lateral Ligaments, and its point by the insertion of the perpendicular Ligament, which is fixed to the edge of the Foramen Magnum of the Occipital Bone. The Superior Oblique Processes placed horizontally, and a little elevated in the middle, to be received into the hollow Inferior Oblique Processes of the Atlas, where the Head has its principal rotatory motion. The Spinous Process, thick and strong, to give ori- gin to the Muscles which assist in the extension and rotation of the Head, and turned down to allow these motions to be readily performed. In a Foetus, the Vertebra Dentata consists of four pieces, three of which are common to all the Vertebrae; the fourth is the Processus Dentatus, which is joined by Cartilage to the Body of the Bone. The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth Vertebrae differ- ing from each other chiefly in becoming larger in their descent. The seventh Cervical Vertebra, approaching in form to the Dorsal Vertebras.â€”The Spinal and Transverse

^0 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. frequently some mark of distinction may be observed in the Cancelli. The Epiphyses belong chiefly to such Bones as are destined for much motion, and have larger diameters than the Bones to which they are fixed; in consequence of this they form a firmer Articulation, aiid give a more commodious attachment to the Muscles. Classes of Bones. Bones are either Broad and Flat, Long and Round, or Spherical and Irregular. Broad Bones have thin sides, and their Cancelli are smaller and more equal in size than in the long ones. They defend the parts which they inclose, and give origin to many Muscles. The long Bones have thick strong Walls at their middle, but become remarkably thin towards their ex- tremities ; on the contrary, the Cancelli are few in num- ber, but large in the middle of the Bone, while^ near the ends, the Cells are numerous and small. The long Bones, by their roundness and thickness, at their middle, are better enabled to resist the vio- lent pressure and injuries to which they are frequently exposed, while their extremities being large, though the quantity of matter is the same, they are less easily broken in a transverse direction. This increase of size allows also a broader Basis for the Body to rest upon, and affords more space for the attachment of Muscles and other soft parts. The spherical irregular Bones admit of a diversity

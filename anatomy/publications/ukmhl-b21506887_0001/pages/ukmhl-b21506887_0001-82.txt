62 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. entire Skull, being partly concealed by the Palate- Bones. Sometimes one or more small passages are observed in or near the Sella Turcica, for the transmission of Elood-vessels into the Sphenoid Sinuses, or to the sub- stance of the Bone. These passages were, in former times, considered by some Authors as conducting Pi- tuita by the Sphenoidal Sinuses into the Nose. The Foramina Lacera Anteriora^ common to the points of the Partes Petrosae and the Sphenoid Bone. In a recent Skull, each of these Holes is filled be- hind by a thin plate of Bone, which covers the internal Carotid Artery, and farther forwards, by a Cartilagi- nous Ligament, which lies over the Eustachian Tube, both of which drop out by maceration. Through this opening, also, Mucus was formerly supposed to be conveyed from the Glandula Pituitaria to the Nose. The Two Sphenoid Sinuses, occupying the whole of the Body, or the middle of the Bone, at the under and fore part of the Sella Turcica, answering the same purposes with the Ethmoid and Frontal Cells. A complete Partition running perpendicularly be- ^ tween the right and left Sphenoid Sinuses. A Passage from the upper and fore part of each of the Sphenoid Sinuses, descending in a slanting direc- tion into the Meatus Superior, or superior-posterior parts of the Nose. Occasionally one of these passages is wanting. The two Sinuses are frequently of unequal size, and sometimes there is but a single large Cavity, with an opening into one of the Nostrils.

COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part 11. j i The Falciform Process leaves a large Opening, where the Vena Saphena Major, ascending upon the \ Pubal Portion of the Fascia Lata, terminates in the ] Femoral Vein. | This Process covers the great Femoral Blood-ves- ' sels, and anterior Crural Nerves, directly after their i exit from the Abdomen. ; At the edge of the Falciform Process, there is some \ Fat and Cellular Substance; here also a Gland is com- | monly placed, and sometimes two, through which se- \ veral of the Superficial Lymphatics of the Thigh pass 1 in their course towards the Abdomen. At this part of ! the Thigh, the portion of the Bowels passing through I the Crural Ring, protrudes in Femoral Hernia. Frequently the Semilunar Edge of the Fascia Lata { is indistinct, the Ilial and Pubal portions being then i confusedly united by an intermixture of Tendinous \ and Cellular Substance. i Behind the Great Vessels and Nerves of the Thigh, I part of the Pubal portion of the Fascia is continued I down, to be fixed to the Os Femoris, as far as the ' place where the Femoral Artery perforates the Triceps j Muscle, j 3 OsLTauus Descendens Externus, j Vel Obliquus Eocternus Abdominis, vel Coslo-Abdo^ \ mifialis. | Origin : In a serrated manner, from the lower edge \ of the eight inferior Ribs, near their Cartilages. The ; Serrae intermix with the Indentations of the Serratus^ < .)

305 Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. Aponeurosis Plantaris. This, like the Aponeurosis Palmaris, is a strong Tendinous Expansion, which covers the Muscles, Ves- sels, and Nerves of the Sole. It arises from the Tuberosity at the under and back part of the Os Calcis, and is divided into three Por- tions, which run forwards, to be connected to the Heads of the Metatarsal Bones of all the Toes. The middle Portion is subdivided into five Slips, which split at the roots of the Toes, and embrace the Tendons of the Flexor Muscles. Besides serving the general purpose of Aponeuroses, it performs the office of a Ligament, by binding the two ends of the Arch of the Foot together. Flexor Brevis Digitorum, Vel Flexor Sublimis, vel Flexor Perforans^ vel Calco- suh-flialangeus Communis. Origin : Narrow and Fleshy, from the inferior-ante^ rior part of the Tuberosity of the Os Calcis, and from the Aponeurosis Plantaris. It forms a thick Fleshy Belly, which sends off four small Tendons, that split for the passage of the Tendons of the Flexor Longus. Insertion : Into the second Phalanx of the four small Toes. Action: To bend the first and second Joints of the Toes, but particularly the second. The Tendon of the Little Toe is frequently wanting. VOL I. u

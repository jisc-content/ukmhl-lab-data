IPakt I.] OF THE BONES. H other consists of those of the External Ear, of the Eye- lids, Nose> Larynx, and Trachea, and of the Articular, Interarticukr, and Intervertebral Cartilages. Op the original Formation of Bone. The generality of Bones are originally formed, either between Membranes, or in the substance of Cartilages; the Teeth are formed in distinct Bags. The Ossification of broad Bones begins, in some, as in those of the Cranium, between Membranes only, and in others, as in the Ossa Iliaj in Cartilage^ and the Ossification appears in each Bone in one or more places : There the Osseous particles are so joined to- gether, as to have a Fibrous appearance. The Fibrous Structure is most distinctly seen in the Bones of the Cranium of a Foetus about three months after Conception, where the beginning of the Ossifica- tion in each Bone is like a fine irregular Net-work, in the middle of which the Fibres are more closely con- nected than in the circumference. In viewing the flat Bones of a Foetus a little more advanced, the bony particles are observed to be so dis^ posed, as to have a distinct radiated appearance. The vacancies between the Fibres, which occasion the radiated appearance, are found by Injection to be chiefly passages for Blood-vessels. As the Foetus becomes larger, the Osseous Fibres increase in number, but become less apparent, the In- terstices being now filled with Osseous matter, which increases in quantity till a Lamina is produced ; and VOL.

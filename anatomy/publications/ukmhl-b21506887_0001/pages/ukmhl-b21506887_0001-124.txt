10^ COMPENmUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I, no passage for the Spinal Marrow, nor Holes for Spi- nal Nerves. The connexion of this Bone, in young Subjects, to the Os Sacrum, by Cartilage,â€”in old People, by a union of Substance. The Surface of the Bone is covered by a strong Li- gament, which adds to its strength; and its sides give rise to numerous Muscular Fibres, which, while they derive their origin from it, serve at the same time to protect it. The Os Coccygis sustains the Intestinum Rectum, contracts the Inferior opening of the Pelvis, and assists in supporting the Rectum, Bladder, and Uterus. It gives origin to the Sphincter Ani, and to part of the Gluteus Maximus, insertion to the Coccygeus, Curvator Coccygis, and to part of the Levator Ani. In a Foetus, the Os Coccygis is almost entirely com- posed of Cartilage; but the different Processes can rea- dily be distinguished from each other by their form.

64 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I. OF THE BONES OF THE FACE. The Bones of the Face, and the relative proportions between the Face and Cranium, vary considerably a- mong people of different nations, but they likewise differ among the individuals of the same country. It is difficult, therefore, to ascertain the proportions with accuracy. An Angle termed Facial^ however, is con- sidered by some late Authors, as being the simplest method of determining this circumstance. The Facial Angle is formed by drawing a line, called Transverse^ through the external Auditory Passage and bottom of the Nostril, and another, termed Facial, from the convexity of the Forehead to the under and fore part of the Upper Jaw, so as to intersect the former. In the Grecian, as measured from the Antique Sta- tue, the Facial Angle is found to be about 90^, or be- tween 90® and 100^ ; in the European, about 80®, or between 80® and 90® ; and in the African, on account of the greater prominence of the Jaws, about 70^ only. According to Dr Camper, the boundaries of the Fa- cial Angle, in the Human Subject, are 70® and 80®. By a vertical longitudinal Section of the Head, the area of the Face of the European is observed to be only half of that of the Cranium, but is somewhat more in the Negro; or, the Face is larger in the one, while the Cranium is bigger in the other. In the Bones of the Face we observe, Their Division into Upper and Under Jazvs. The Upper Jaw, or Maxilla Superior, besides the

104 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part I, part of the Os Innominatum, and spreading out, to as- sist in supporting the contents of the Abdomen. The Dorsum^ or outer Surface of the Bone, depressed at the fore part, raised farther back, and concave be- hind, the whole giving origin to the Glutei Muscles, or Extensors of the Thigh. The Crista or Spine, or upper semicircular edge of the Bone, for the attachment of the Oblique and Trans- verse Abdominal Muscles. In a recent Subject, the Spine is covered with a Tendinous and Cartilaginous crust, that separates in macerating the Bone. The anterior-superior Spinous Process, or anterior extremity of the Spine, for the attachment of the Sar- torius, the Tensor Vaginae Femoris, and of Poupart's Ligament, or Crural Arch. The anterior-inferior Spinous Process, a little below the former, for the attachment of the Rectus Femoris. Between the two anterior Spinous Processes, a Notch for lodging the beginning of the Sartorius Muscle. The two posterior Spinous Processes, at the back part of the Spine, less considerable than the two anterior; partly for the origin of Muscles of the Back, but chiefly for the attachment of Ligaments which belong to the Joint between this Bone and the Os Sacrum. The outside of the posterior Spinous Processes flat and rough, where parts of the Gluteus Maximus and Pyri- formis take their origin. The Notch of the Os Ilium under the posterior-infe- rior Spinous Process, for the passage of the Pyriform Muscle, Sciatic Nerve, and Blood-vessels. The Venter, qr inner concave Surface of the Bone, for

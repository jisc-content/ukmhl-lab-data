m COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part L PRINCIPAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MALE AND FEMALE SKELETONS. The Female Skeleton is observed, in general, to be smaller and more slender throughout than that of the Male. The Bone of an Adult Female, of the same size with that of a Male, is usually distinguished by the Ridges, Depressions, rough Surfaces, and other Ine- qualities, being less conspicuous in the former. The Circumference of a Female Skull is said by SoEMMERRTNG to be larger. The Os Frontis is found to be more frequently di- vided by a continuation of the Sagittal Suture. The Frontal Sinuses are observed to be narrower ; All the Bones of the face more delicate; The Bodies of the Vertebrae longer, and the Verte- bral Canal, according to the Author quoted above, larger; The Intervertebral Substances deeper or thicker ; The Cartilages of the True Ribs longer in propor- tion to the Osseous part, and broader and flatter to support the Breasts ;

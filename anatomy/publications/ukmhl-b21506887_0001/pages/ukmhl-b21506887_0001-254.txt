194 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pakt II. Pterygoideus Externus, vel Minor, Vel Pterygo-maxillaris Minor. Origin : From the outer side of the Pterygoid Pro cess of the Sphenoid Bone; from the Tuberosity of the superior Maxillary Bone; and from the root of the Temporal Process of the Sphenoid Bone. From these Origins it passes almost horizontally outwards, and a little backwards. Insertion : Into the Cervix and Capsular Ligament of the Lower J aw. Action: To pull the Lower Jaw to the opposite side, and, if both Muscles act, to bring it forwards, so as to make the Fore-Teeth project beyond those of the Up- per Jaw. The Muscle, in its different motions, acts also upon the Inter-articular Cartilage. The lower Jaw is raised by the Temporalis, Masse- teres, and Pterygoidei Interni;—depressed by the Di- gastrici, Platysmae Myoides, Mylo-hyoidei, and Genio- hyo-glossi; moved forwards by the Masseteres, Ptery- goidei Externi, and Mylo-hyoidei;—hac'k'wards by the Temporales, Masseteres, Digastrici, Genio-hyoidei, and Genio-hyo-glossi;—and laterally^ by the Pterygoidei Externus et Intern us, acting upon one side or the other alternately.—By a succession of the above mo- tions grinding is performed.

The greater number of Bones have Prominences, termed Processes^ projecting from them. When the process is of a roundish form, it is termed Caput, or Head. If the Head be flattened, it has the name of Condyle. A rough unequal Protuberance is styled Tuberosity. When a Process comes off from a Bone narrow, and is afterwards enlarged, the contracted part of it is called Cervix, or Neck. A long Ridge upon a Bone is termed Spine. A pro- cess terminating in a sharp point is named Coronoid. Some Processes derive their names from the sub- stances they are supposed to resemble,—as Coracoid, like a Crow's Beak,—Styloid, like a Pen or Pencil,— Mastoid, like a Nipple,—or Anconoid, from belonging to the Elbow,—or Spinous, from being sharp like a Thorn. The rising Edges or Brims of Cavities are known by the name of Supercilia. The use of the Processes is to give a more advanta- geous attachment to Muscles, and form Surfaces of Articulations.

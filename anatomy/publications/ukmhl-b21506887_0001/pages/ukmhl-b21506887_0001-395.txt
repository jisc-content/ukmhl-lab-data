Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS. 835 convex or outer part of the Vertebrae, from the upper to the under region of the Spine. It begins at the se- cond Cervical Vertebra, and descends as far as the Os Sacrum, where it spreads out, becomes thinner, and vanishes about the under part of this Bone. It is much thicker upon the fore part than on the sides of the Vertebrae, by which the Bones are more firmly united anteriorly^ and is thinnest in the Neck and Loins, where the motions of the Spine are greatest. Internally it is blended with the Periosteum, and,. through its whole course, it sends off small Processes to be fixed to the Bodies of the Vertebrae, by which their connexion is made more secure. While it assists in binding the Vertebrae together, it prevents the Spine from being stretched too much backwards. The Crucial Intervertebral Ligaments, which are numerous and short, but strong, situated behind the Ligamentum Commune Anterius, crossing each other obliquely. They join the Bodies of the Vertebrae to- gether, upon the outer edges of the Intervertebral Substances, to which also they firmly adhere. The Intervertebral Substances, (already described along with the Bones), which join the Bodies of the Vertebrae together, and allow an yielding motion in all directions. These Substances are so compressible as to yield to the weight of the upper part of the Body ; so that, after having been in an erect posture through the course of the day, the height of a person of middle stature, and in the prime of life, is diminished from half an inch to an inch in the evening; but, after a night's rest in the usual attitude, it is completely restored.

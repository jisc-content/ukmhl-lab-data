60 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Pakt I. side of it, where these Nerves are situated, previously to their entering the Orbits. The Fossa Pituitaria^ Sella Turcica^ Epliippium^ or Turkish Saddle^ situated between the Processus Oli- varis and posterior Clinoid Process, but open laterally, for lodging the Glandula Pituitaria. A Notch^ running upwards at each side of the Pos- terior Clinoid Process, and from it a slight impression, stretched along the lateral parts of the Sella Turcica, and terminating in a Pit at the root of the anterior Cli- noid Process. These point out the course of the in- ternal Carotid Arteries, when they have entered the Cranium, and previously to their perforating the Dura Mater, to be dispersed upon the Brain. Besides these Impressions, several others may be ob- served, made by Nerves and Vessels leading to or from their respective Foramina in the base of the Cranium. The Foramina observed in this Bone are placed at the roots of the Temporal Processes, or between these and the Body of the Bone, and are as follow, viz. The Foramina Optica between the roots of the ante- rior Clinoid Processes and body of the Bone, for the transmission of the Optic Nerves and Ocular Arteries. Sometimes, though rarely, there are Foramina pecu- liar to these Arteries. The Foramina Lacera Superior a, or Superior Orhi- tar Fissures, under the anterior Clinoid Processes and their transverse Spinous Parts, for the passage of the third, fourth, first part of the fifth, and the sixth pair of Nerves, with the Ocular Veins. The Foramina. Lacera are largest at their inner ends. At their outer extremities they are considerably smaller,

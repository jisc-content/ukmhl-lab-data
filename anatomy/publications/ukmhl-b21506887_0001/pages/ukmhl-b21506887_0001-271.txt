Part ILj OF THE MUSCLES. ^11 o 2 along the Spermatic Cord as far as the Scrotutti, the rest of it spreading over the Inguinal Glands, and va- nishing in the Fat of the Thigh. The whole of this Fascia is frequently so thin, as to appear little else than Cellular Substance! condensed. In the inflamed state, however, it sometimes becomes remarkably thick. It forms the outer, or Superficial Fascia, in Inguinal and Crural Hernias. Under the Superficial Fascia, on the Thigh, there is a thick and strong Aponeurosis, which arises from the fore part of the Spine of the Ilium, from the whole iinder edge of the Crural Arch, and from the upper and fore part of the Os Pubis. This forms a portion of the Fascia Lata Femoris, (to be afterwards taken notice of), which incloses the Muscles, Vessels, and Nerves of the Thigh. The part arising from the Ilium and Crural Arch is termed Ilial^ and that from the Pubis, Puhalportion of the Fascia Lata. The Ilial and Pubal portions are united behind the upper end of the Vein termed So- phena Major, and form a considerable Angle at the inner side of the Femoral Vessels, and between the Muscles on the fore and those on the inner side of the Thigh, The upper and inner part of the Ilial portions, forms a Semilunar Edge, which is concave towards the inner part of the Thigh, and is described by Me Buens, in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal for 1806, under the name of Falciform Process. The upper and inner part of this Process is twisted in, where it is fixed to the Os Pubis, and forms the Femoral LigO* ment of Me Hey.

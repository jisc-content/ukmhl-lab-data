The upper end of this Process rough, where the Triceps Extensor Cubiti is fixed. The Coronoid, or Sharp Process, at the upper and fore part of the Bone, but considerably lower than the Olecranon, for forming a part of the Hinge of the Joint of the Elbow. The Great Sigmoid, or Semilunar Cavity, between the Olecranon and Coronoid Process, lined with Car- tilage, and divided into two slanting Surfaces by a middle Ridge, the Cavity being adapted to the Troch- lea of the Os Humeri. Across the middle of the greatf Sigmoid Cavity, a little Pit, for lodging part of the Fat of the Joint. Round the edge of the Sigmoid Cavity, the Bone

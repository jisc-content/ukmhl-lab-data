â€¢ Part I ] OF THE BONES. 81 rior Foramina, a little below the roots of the Teeth, and having many Perforations, for the passage of small Branches of Vessels and Nerves which supply the Jaw and Teeth. The Tables of the Jaw, remarkably tUck^ compact, and hard, and within, furnished with numerous Me- dullary Cells, which surround the Maxillary Canals. The Articulation of the Jaw by its Condyloid Pro- cess with the Glenoid Cavity of the Temporal Bone, and also with the Tubercle at the root of its Zygoma- tic Process. An intermediate moveable Cartilage, thin in the centre and thicker at the edges, is placed in the Articulation of the Lower Jaw, allowing the Condyle to remain in the Glenoid Cavity, in the gentler motion of the Jaw, but admitting it to advance upon the Tubercle or Root of the Zygoma, when the Mouth is widely opened. The Lower Jaw is a principal agent in Manduca- tion. Deglutition, and Speech ; and gives origin to the Depressor Labii Inferioris, Depressor Anguli Oris, Levator Labii Inferioris, Mylo-hyoideus, Genio-hyoi- deus, and to part of the Buccinator, of the Genio-hyo- glossus, and Constrictor Pharyngis Superior; insertion to the Temporalis, Masseter, Pterygoidei Externus et Internus, Digastricus, and to part of the Platysma Myoides. In a Foetus, the Lower Jaw is somewhat of a semi circular Figure, and is composed of two pieces joined together in the middle of the Chin, by the interven- tion of a Cartilage. This union, termed Symphysis, gradually ossifies, and leaves no mark of any former division. VOL. I. p

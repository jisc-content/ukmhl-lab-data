OF THE BURSJE MUCOSA IN GENERAL. 1 HE BuRSiE Mucosae belong chiefly to the Extremi- ties, though a few exist also in other parts of the Body. The greater number of them are constant, some are met with only occasionally. They are found between parts exposed to friction, as between Tendons and Bones, where these play upon each other, as at the insertion of the Biceps Flexor Cubiti. Or between Tendon and Cartilage, as where the Pe- roneus Longus crosses the Sole : Or completely surrounding the Tendons, and lining their Sheaths, as around the Tendons of the Flexores Digitorum : Or where Tendons rub on each other, as between those of the Extensores Carpi Radiales and Extensores Pollicis: Or between Tendons and External Parts, as over the Tendons of the Flexores Digitorum in the Palm of the Hand : Or between Tendons and Ligaments of the Joints, as between the Tendons of the Flexores Digitorum and Ligamentum Carpi Capsulare. They are found in a few places where Processes of Bone play upon Ligaments, as between the Acromion Scapulae and Capsular Ligament of the Humerus :

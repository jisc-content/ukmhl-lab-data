361 Part III.] OF THE LIGAMENTS. bula, which are called Anterior-Superior^ and Poste- rior-Superior, according to their situations, arising from the edges of the Semilunar Cavity of the Tibia, and fixed to the Malleolus Externus of the Fibula. The Ligaments between the ends of the Tibia and Fibula join the two Bones so firmly together, as to ad- mit of no sensible motion. Ligaments connecting the Bones of the Tarsus with those of the Leg. The Anterior Ligament of the Fibula^ which arises from the anterior part of the Malleolus Externus, and passes obliquely forwards, to be fixed to the upper and outer part of the Astragalus. The Middle, or Perpendicular Ligament of the Fi- bula, which arises from the point of the Malleolus Ex- ternus, and descends almost perpendicularly, to be in- serted into the outside of the Os Calcis. The Posterior Ligament of the Fibula, which arises from the under and back part of the Malleolus Exter- nus, and runs backwards, to be joined to the outer and posterior part of the Astragalus. The Ligamentum Deltoides of the Tibia, which arises from the Malleolus Internus, and descends in a radiated form, to be attached to the Astragalus, Os Calcis, and Os Naviculare. The Capsular Ligament, which lies within the former Ligaments, and is remarkably thin, especially before and behind, for the readier motion of the Joint. It arises from the Margin of the Articular Cavity of the

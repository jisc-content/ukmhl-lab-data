S44 COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [PabtIII. the Clavicle, and is fixed to the Cartilage of the first Rib. The Ligaments which join the posterior extremity of the Clavicle to the Acromion, having a Capsular Li- gament within, and sometimes an Inter-articular Car- tilage. The Ligamentum Conoideum, which arises from the root of the Coracoid Process, and is fixed to the Tu- bercle at the outer end of the Clavicle. The Ligamentum Trapezoideum, which arises from the point of the Coracoid Process, and is fixed to the under edge of the Clavicle. A thin Ligamentous Slip, which comes from the Ten- don of the Subclavius, or from the Clavicle, and joins the Trapezoid Ligament. The Ligaments fixing the Clavicle to the Scapula are of such strength, as to allow only a small degree of motion, and that chiefly of a rolling or twisting nature. Ligaments proper to the Scapula. The Proper Anterior Triangular Ligament of the Scapula, which arises broad from the External Surface of the Coracoid Process, and becomes narrower where it is fixed to the posterior margin of the Acromion. This Ligament forms one continued Surface. It is thickest, however, on each side, and these thicker parts are united by a thin intermediate Ligamentous Mem- brane, which, when removed, gives to the Ligament the appearance of being double. It confines the Tendon of the Supra-spinatus, and

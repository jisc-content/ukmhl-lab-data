COMPENDIUM OF ANATOMY. [Part II. the Bowels protrude in Femoral Hernia. In a Male the opening is more filled up, in consequence of the greater thickness of the Flexor Muscles of the Thigh, and the breadth of the surrounding Ligaments. The Crural Foramen is at the beginning of the Cru^ ral Sheath, and situated within it, and is commonly occupied by Absorbent Glands ; or sometimes by the Trunks of the Absorbents themselves, coming from the Thigh; or now and then by a cross Stratum of Liga- mentous Matter ; in consequence of which, when the parts are prepared, there may be either a Foramen, or a Cribiform appearance, or an Impervious Septum in the Crural Ring. In this last case, the Absorbents are found to creep along the Coats of the Blood-vessels, in their course to the Abdomen. Half way between the Spine of the Ilium and Sym- physis Pubis, the Fascia Transversalis leaves an open- ing for the passage of the Spermatic Cord, or for the round Ligament of the Uterus; the beginning of which passage may be considered as the Internal or Superior Abdominal Ring. The under part of this opening is formed by Pou- part''s Ligament, the upper by the Transverse and In- ternal Oblique Muscles. From this opening there is no direct passage out- wards, the part being shut by the Tendon of the Obli- quus Externus. The inner Ring is of the same form and size with the outer Ring, and is directed in the same mariner with it. Between the Internal and External Abdominal Rings,

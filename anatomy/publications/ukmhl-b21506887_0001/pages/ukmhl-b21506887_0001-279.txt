The anterior and posterior portions of the Fascia uniting together at the sides of the Blood-Vessels, from the lateral parts of the Sheath. Lower than the Crural Arch, and extending as far as the Perforation in the Tendon of the great Adduc- tor Muscle of the Thigh, the Artery is covered before by the Fascia Lata, behind by the deep part, or Pu- bal portion of that Fascia, and laterally by the two^ Fascia conjoined by Cellular Substance^ The Sheath and Vessels it incloses, at the upper part of the Thigh, and the External Iliac Vessels also at the inner part of the Pelvis, are strengthened by some Tendinous Slips, which run between, and also at the sides of the Vessels, uniting them together, to the Cru- ral Arch before, and to the Bones behind, over which they pass. Within the Fasciae, the Vessels are closely connected together, as the Great Vessels in the Neck are, by a Vagina of Cellular Substance condensed, and which may be considered as the proper Sheath of the Great Vessels situated in the Thigh. Between the inner part of the External Iliac Vein, and the Insertion of the under column of Poupart's Ligament into the Os Pubis, and having the Os Pubis behind, covered by its Ligament, a triangular space i& left, at the outer part of which there is a small Aper- ture, which forms the Crural Foramen of Gimbernat, The triangular Cavity and Aperture are more consi- derable in a Female than in a Male, on account of the greater width of the Pelvis, Through this Foramen

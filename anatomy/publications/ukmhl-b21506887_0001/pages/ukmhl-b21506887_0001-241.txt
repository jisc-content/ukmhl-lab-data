Part II.] OF THE MUSCLES. 181 to Muscular Fibres, to keep them in their proper si- tuation, and to brace them in their action. Annular Ligaments^ to keep Tendons from starting. Trochlece^ or Pulleys, to alter the direction of Ten- dons. BurscE MucoscB, placed where Tendons play over hard Substances, serving to contain Synovia, and pre- vent Abrasion, MUSCLES OF THE INTEGUMENTS of the CRANIUM, AND of the EYE-LIDS. " Occipito-Frontalis, Vel Occipitalis et Frontalis, vel Epicranius, &c. Origin: Fleshy from near the middle of the upper arched Ridge of the Occipital Bone, and Tendinous from the extremity of that Ridge, where it joins the Temporal Bone.â€”It arises after the same manner on the other side. From the Fleshy Origins, and also from between them, a Tendinous expansion is extended along the upper part of the Cranium, adhering firmly to the Skin, and but loosely to the Pericranium. At the upper part of the Forehead it becomes Fleshy^ and descends with straight Fibres, the under part of the Muscle laying hold of, or taking its Origin from, the Frontal Bone, at the inner part of the Orbits.

Part I.] OF THE BONES. 1S9 The Cervioc or Neck^ surrounding the edge of the Ball, and forming a superficial Fossa, where the Cap- sular Ligament is fixed. Numerous Holes round the upper end of the Bone, for the insertion of the Fibres of the Capsular Liga- ment, and for the passage of Blood-vessels into the Bone. A long Groove or Fossa, lined with a Cartilaginous and Tendinous Crust, in the upper and fore part of the Bone, for lodging the Tendon of the long Head of the Biceps, which descends from the upper edge of the Glenoid Cavity of the Scapula. The smaller Tubercle, placed at the upper and inner side of the above-mentioned Groove, for the attach- ment of the Subscapularis* The larger Tuberele, opposite to the former, and on the outer side of the Groove, for the attachment of the Muscles which cover the Dorsum of the Scapula ; viz. the two Spinati, and Teres Minor. A Ridge continued down from each Tubercle along the sides of the long Fossa, for the insertion of Mus- cles passing from the Trunk of the Body, or from the Scapula. To the External Ridge the Pectoralis Major is fixed, and to the Internal the Latissimus Dor si and Teres Major are inserted. Behind the lower end of this last, another Ridge for the insertion of the Coraco-Brachialis. From the back part of the root of the largest Tu- bercle, a Ridge descends, from which the short Head of the Triceps Extensor Cubiti rises. A Passage slanting downwards in the fore and inner VOL. I. I

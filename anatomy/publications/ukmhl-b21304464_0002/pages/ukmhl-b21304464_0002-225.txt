203 of INTESTINAL WORMS. Anatomical Structure. This animal is covered by an elastic and porous membrane, which, when examined by a micro- scope, seems smeared with a tenacious liquid, which exudes through the pores. Under the membrane, some scattering fibres of a white colour are seen, the external of which are fixed into the inferior margin of each joint, and are disposed in a longitudinal manner ; the Inner set of fibres following a transverse course. The Alimentary Canal, which takes its rise from the mouth, divides into two distinct Canals, which pass along the margins of the joints: and in the last joint, these Canals are Impervious. Besides these longitudinal marginal tubes, there are transverse Canals which pass across the inferior margin of each joint, and communicate with the longitudinal Canals. These Canals were first Injected by Ernest. * Besides the above Canals, there is a pretty large Canal in the centre of each joint, (which was in- jected with quicksilver by my Father, and which has been particularly described by Dr F. Palmer, in his Thesis), which divides somewhat like a tree into a number of small lateral branches, which communicate with the Lateral Oscula, by small openings. * Vid. ^Jallek, DIsput. Med, Vol. III.

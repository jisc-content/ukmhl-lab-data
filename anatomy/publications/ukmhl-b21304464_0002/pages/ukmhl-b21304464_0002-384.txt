It still remains to be determined, whether ei- ther of the above opinions relative to the struc- ture of Glands, be correct, and whether all Glands have the same structure. I am disposed, from an accurate examination of the various preparations of glands made by my Father, to conclude, that Glands have not a similar struc- ture. As none of the secreted fluids are found to ex- ist in the blood, the term Secretion implies, not merely a filtering, but the formation of an entire new fluid. The secreted fluids are very different from each other in taste, smell, colour, and consistency. Some are watery, others gelatinous, others oily ; and they have therefore been arranged into clas- ses, according to their chemical qualities, by Fourcroy and other chemists. I'he different secreted fluids pass through the Excretory Ducts ; the size of which is very vari- ous. The ducts of some Glands open separately, as those of the Mammae, upon the surface of the Papilla of that organ ; the ducts of other Glands', as those of the Tonsils, pour their contents into a blind sac ; but, in other instances, all the excre- tory ducts are united into one large tube; and in the case of the liver and urinary organs, that large tube passes into a receptacle, within which the se- creted fluid is retained for a lime, and probably

87 OF THE FASCIA LATA OF THE THIGH. muscle, which Is bounded by a well-defined ten- dinous border, except at its inner edge. The situation of the above-mentioned depres- sion merits notice, as marking the situation of Crural Hernia. In the Fascia Lata, there is an aperture through which the Vena Saphena Major passes, to join the Femoral Vein, the borders of which aperture are covered by fat, cellular sub- stance, and Lymphatic Glands. The Fascia La- ta has been described as being composed of two distinct portions: one of which covers the upper and outer part of the Thigh, and is connected with the larger share of the Crural Arch, between the Anterior Spinous process of the Os Ilium and Tubercle of the Pubes, and may be called lUal portion ; and the other, which arises from the Pubes, Pubal portion. Where the Iliac part of the Fascia Lata ceases to be united to the Crural Arch, it forms a fold of the shape of a sickle, the concavity of which looks downwards and in- wards ; which was first accurately described by Mr Burns of Glasgow, and called, by him, the Falsiform Process of the Fascia Lata j and this covers that portion of the Femoral Artery and Vein which is found immediately under the Cru- ral Arch, and the under part of the Iliacus Inter- nes and Psoas muscles. The other, or Pubal part., which is thinner than the Ilial portion of the tendon, arises from the Pubes, and covers part of the Pectineus and Triceps muscles, and i? united with the Ilial part

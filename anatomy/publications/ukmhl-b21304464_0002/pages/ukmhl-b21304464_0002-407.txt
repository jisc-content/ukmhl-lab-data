The Trachea is placed at the fore part of the Neck, and connected to the under part of the Larynx, where it is covered only by skin and cellular membrane ; but a little lower by the Thy- roid Gland; and towards the under part of the Neck it lyes deeper, and is in part covered by the Sterno-hyoid, and Sterno-thyroid Muscles. The Trachea is divided nearly opposite to the Third Dorsal Vertebra, into two great branches called Bronchi^ one of which passes to the right, the other to the left Lungs. These branches are of unequal diameter j the left is the smaller and longer, and passes under the Arch of the Aorta,- before penetrating the substance of the Lungs; whereas the right dips immediately into the Lungs. The Bronchi are subdivided into a great num- ber of small branches, which are distributed through every part of the Liings, and each branch of which has its corresponding Artery and Vein. The Cartilages of the Trachea are various in number, according to the length of the Neck; generally we meet with sixteen of them. They, are placed horizontally, in respect to the axis of the Windpipe j are bent forwards like a bow ; are uniform in length and thickness; are continued around about two-thirds of the Windpipe, which /OL. ii‘ B b

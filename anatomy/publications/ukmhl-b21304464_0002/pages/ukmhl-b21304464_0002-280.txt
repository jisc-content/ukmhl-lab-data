258 OUTLINES OF ANATOaMV; possess any degree of contractile power, like the genuine Hydatid. Of the Sac of Hydatids. The Sac of the Hydatid, seems to be formed of condensed Cellular substance ; and the thickness of the Sac generally bears a ratio to its size and situation. This Sac is secured in its place by several bands of Cellular substance, which pass between it and the bowel within which it is lodged ; and in the Abdomen, it is covered by the Peritonaeum. Tiie thickness of the Sac of a Hydatid is in proportion to its size ; although there is a consi- derable difference in this particular, the Sac being thickest where it is most exposed. Thus, when the greater part of the Sac is surrounded by the substance of a bowel, as of the Liver, for instance, th'at part only of the Sac which is exposed is of a considerable thickness, and is sometimes cartilagi- nous, or covered by layers of bone. I have observed, that the irmer surface of the Sac is by no means uniform, but always somewhat irregular, and lined by a very thin layer of fat. A glairy gelatinous liquor is also interposed be- tween the Sac and the Hydatid, which prevents the Hydatids from being injured by friction. Tlie Sac of a large Hydatid is Sometimes di- vided into compartments, which serve to prevent the smaller Hydatids, contained within the opposite ends of the Sac, from pressing upon each other.

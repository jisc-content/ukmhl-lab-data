■BILIARY CALCULI. 27.7 ammonia, there seemed to be phosphat of lime present. “ Heated in a small bent glass tube, connected with a water pneumatic apparatus, only a few bubbles of gas were produced; there was no re- jfidue, but a total sublimation of the substance. The condensed product was not unlike petroleum; it had a brownish black colour, a bituminous smell, and a viscid consistence. These are all the experiments I have made on this interesting substance. Their results are so similar to those obtained from true Biliary Calcu- li, that there can be little doubt but this belongs to the same class of bodies ; and, independent of its appearance, its slightly bitter taste confirms this conclusion. ” Biliary Calculi have also been discharged through a fistulous opening, on the surface of the Abdomen, which communicated with an abscess of the Liver, or with an enlarged Gall-Bladder. The Coats of the Gall-Bladder have been found thickened and hard; and the Gall-Bladder has been sometimes much contracted, and, according to some, obliterated. The Biliary Ducts have been sometimes ob- literated. 32

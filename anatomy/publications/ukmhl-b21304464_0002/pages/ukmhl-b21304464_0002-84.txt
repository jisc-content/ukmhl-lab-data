The anterior head of the Digastric Muscle, ex- tending between the symphysis of the lower jaw and os hyoides, and the posterior head of the same muscle passing through the Stylo-Hyoid Muscle, downwards and forwards, to be fixed to the os hyoides ; and between the two heads of the mus- cle, the submaxillary gland is placed. Second Layei\ Upon detaching the above named muscles, the thin and broad muscle, called Mylo-hyoidem comes into view, extending between the os hyoi- des, and a considerable portion of the under jaw. The stylo-glossus muscle also comes into view, arising from the styloid process of the under .jaw, and supported by its ligament, and paffing down- wards to be fixed into the tongue ; and a little below that muscle, another muscle, taking its rise also from the styloid process, and passing downwards to the pharynx, called hence Stylo- pharyngeus, comes into view. ^ Between the two preceding muscles and the Mylo-hyoideus muscle, there is the Hyo-glossus muscle, with its fibres passing nearly perpendi- cularly downwards to be fixed into the toiigue.;

OUTLINES OF ANATOMV. 392 Rib SO much farther from the Sternum, that they must act upon the under Rib with more advan- tage of lever, or are intended for its elevation. ‘ On the other hand, if the Internal Intercos- tals had been intended for the depression of the Ribs, we certainly should have found them con- tinued backwards to the Spine ; because, from their obliquity, their under end would have been fixed to the Vertebrae, or nearer to the head of the Rib, and their upper end at such a distance from it, that this portion of the muscle would have been better calculated than any other portion of it for the depression of the Rib. ‘ 6. In a few experiments which I made on living animals, soon after I began to study ana- tomy, and which I repeated afterwards, particu- larly in 1770, I saw plainly, as Dr Haller had done, that both rows of Intercostal Muscles were in action during inspiration. ‘ Let us now consider the purpose, ‘ First, Of the obliquity of the fibres in the In- tercostal Muscles; and, ‘ Secondly, Of their being disposed in two lay- ers, the fibres of which decussate each other, ^ It is evident, that the obliquity of the fibres here is not intended to increase their number, or the strenc[th of the muscle, because the fibres would have been more numerous if they had pass- ed directly from the one Rib to the other, or had been inserted into the Ribs at right angles, f I apprehend, therefore, that we are explain

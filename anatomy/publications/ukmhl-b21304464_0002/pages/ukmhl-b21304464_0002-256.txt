OUTLINES or ANATO.MT, 234 Sect, IV. OF BILE. The Bile is a viscid fluid, somewhat of a ge- latinous consistence, and varies a little in- its colour at different times ; being sometimes of a golden colour; sometimes of a dirty yellow colour, inclining to green ; and is to the taste bitter. The Bile taken from the Gall-Bladder is per- fectly similar to that of the Hepatic Duct in taste, colour, and smell, but is somewhat more viscid. Bile is an animal soap. Bile contains, according to Mr Thenard, some yellow matter suspended in it; and when evapo- rated to dryness, it leaves a brown matter, amount- ing to about of its original weight. The following substances, and the following propor- tions of these, were obtained by Thenard * from 1100 parts of human Bile. 1000.0 Water. from 2 to to yellow insoluble matter, yellow matter in solution, a trace. 41.0 Resin. 42.0 Albumen. 5.6 Soda. 4.5 Phosphate of Soda, Sulphate of Soda, Muriate of Soda, Phosphate of Lime, Oxide of Iron ; but no Picrorael, like ox Bile. * FiV/.

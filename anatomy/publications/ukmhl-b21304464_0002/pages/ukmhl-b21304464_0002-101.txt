MUSCLES or THE PAHIETES OF THE ABDOMEN. 79 three lowest Lumbar Vertebrae, and from the in- ner side of the Crural Arch. From these origins the fibres describe a radiated course upwards; and at the Linea Semilunaris, the tendon is fixed to the muscle, which divides into two layers ; one of W'hich joins that of the External Oblique, and forms the fore part of the sheath of the Rectus muscle; the other joins that of the Transverse > muscle, and goes behind the Rectus, forming the posterior part of the sheath, till about half way between the Navel and Os Pubis. . This muscle is fixed into the Linea Alba, the Cartilages of the False Ribs, and the Cartilage Ensiformis. Lumbo-abdominalis, or Transversns Abdominis. This muscle arises from the inner side of Pou- partâ€™s Ligament, from the back part of the spine of the Ilium, from the inner surface of the six lower Ribs, and from the transverse processes of the four uppermost Vertebrae of the Loins. The fibres of this muscle run transversely a- cross the Abdomen, and are fixed into the Linea Alba and Ensiform cartilage of the Sternum. Stebno-pubalis, or Rectus Abdominis. This muscle arises from the Cartilages of the three undermost True Ribs, and extremity of the Breast bone. It forms a broad flat muscle, which is disposed in a parallel manner to the Linea AI-

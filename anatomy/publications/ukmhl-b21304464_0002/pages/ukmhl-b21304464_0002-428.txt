OUTLINES OF ANATOMV. t The Air Cells of the Lungs are sometimes much enlarged in the asthmatic, and sometimes ruptured from Hooping Cough. The liUngs are sometimes, in part, reduced to a state of Cartilage, within the centre of which Ossification takes place. ^ Hydatids are,someiimes attached to the Lungs. The Lungs have sometimes been ruptured by the Ribs being beaten inwards, or in consequence of excessive screaming:. Masses of coagulable Lymph are sometimes found within the branches of the Trachea, of which they take an exact mould. Cretaceous-like concretions are sometimes coughed up from the Lungs. In order to discover the composition of these Concretions found in the Lungs, I sent two or three of them to Mr Jotin Davy, and requested of him to examine them ; at the same time I sent to him a Concretion which had been lodged in the Trachea, and also a Concretion which had been obtained from the Duct of the Parotid Gland. Mr Davy has favoured me with the following account of the above Concretions. ‘ My Dear Sir, ‘ I tiAVE examined the Concretions \ ‘ you put into my hands ; and, from my experi- ‘ ments, they seem to approach very nearly to ‘ the nature of bone, not differing from bone in ® composition more than different kinds of bone

The fibres of this muscle follow different direc- tions, and are inserted, and intimately incorporat- ed with the muscular fibres of the side of the Rectum, and also with the fibres of the Sphincter Ani muscle, and Accelerator Urinae. This muscle forms the lowest part of the cavity of the abdomen. It also retracts the Intestinum Curvum, after the evacuation of the faeces; and, by pressing upon the Vesiculae Seminales, and Prostate Gland, may assist in expelling the contents of these parts. The part of the muscle which arises from the Ossa Pubis, and incloses the Prostate Gland, has been named by Albinus the Compressor Pro- states. IscHio-FerineALis, or Transversalis Ptriinti. This muscle arises from the inner side of the tuberosity of the Ischium, behind the Erector Penis, is disposed in a transverse direction, and is inserted into the back-part of the Accelerator Uri- nae. This muscle serves to dilate the bulb of the Urethra, and also assists in retracting the Intesti- nuin Curvum, after the faeces have been evacuated.

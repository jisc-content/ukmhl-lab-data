or THE FUNCTIONS OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. 297 and hence, these disorders are probably produced by the same kind of poison. 6. From the state of the Lymphatic Glands in the neighbourhood of a diseased part, an opinion may be formed, whether the Tumour is in an in- dolent state, or whether acrid matter has been ge- nerated within it. Thus, take the case of a woman labouring un- der a Scirrhus of the Breast. If the Lymphatic Glands of the Axilla are swollen, there is reason to apprehend that the Scirrhus has degenerated into a Cancer ; and the swelling of the whole arm is an index of the advanced state of the Cancer. This circumstance is also a proof, that the Veins coivceying red blood do not perform absorption / because, though the enlarged and diseased Axil- lary Lymphatic Glands press upon the Veins con- veying red blood, yet the Cephalic Vein, which passes between the Pectoral and Deltoid muscles, is not, cannot be in the smallest degree compres- sed. 7. The knowledge of the course of the Lymph- atic System may also suggest the most efficacious method of administering medicines, with the view to mitigate the acrimony of several poisons, and thus to remove the danger of such disorders. For example, the Lues Venerea, which is re- I ceived and propagated by the Lymphatic Vessels, may be more efTectually cured by rubbing in mer- cury,' so that it shall pass through the Lymphatic

* ON THE GULLET. I EXPLANATION OF PLATE XXV. . This Plate, which was published in my Thesis de Dysphagia, represents the termination of the Gullet in the ftomach. â€¢ The folds of the internal membrane .of the Gullet are seen, as also a while border around the end of the Gullet, which seem- ed to be formed by^the cuticle stopping at this place ; for I could not trace it along the villous coat pf the stomach. ^ It may not be^ improper to add, that Mr E. Home has lately Represented the cuticle of the Gullet nearly in the same manner. * * Fid. London Phil. Trans, for 1807, Part II. The re- presentations of the human stomach, and those of animals, are by far the best which have hitherto been published.

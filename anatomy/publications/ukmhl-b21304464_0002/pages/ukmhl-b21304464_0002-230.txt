OUTLINES OP ANATOMY. 208 â–  Jscans Vermicidaris, Ascaris Liimhricoides, and Trkhuris Hominis. Ascaris Vermicidaris. AscarideSj when recently discharged, are nearly transparent. This is the smallest, and most common species of Worm, and is found generally in the Rectum. They are about half an inch in length, and divid- ed into three parts. The head, in which three vesicles may be observed, with an aperture in the middle, is obtuse, and the tail ends in a sharp point. This Worm has a distinct cuticle, cutis vera, and annular muscles. The male seems to have only an CEsophagus, Stomach, and Intestines. The Stomach is a round bag, situated at the sides of the CEsophagus; this, according to Goeze, constitutes a distinguishing character of the species. The male organs of generation have not as yet been detected. . In the female, the apparatus for generation is visible. It begins as a slender tube, from a small opening, which is situated near the middle of the body ; it gradually becomes larger, and surrounds the Intestinal Canal. The Uterus is hot bifurcated as in the Ascaris Lumbricoides; and its end is as large as any other part of it..

OUTLINES or ANATOMY. brlcate the surfaces of the Serous Membranes that line the Cranium, the Thorax, and Abdo>. men ; besides which, there are numerous excern- ing Arteries upon the surface of the Skin, and internal surface of the Lungs. Lastly, Some of the branches of the Arteries terminate in organs of a cellular structure, as the Penis and Clitoris. In short, by the Capillary System many of the most important functions of the body are perform- ed, as Nutrition, Secretion, Exhalation. Before concluding this Section, it may not be improper to add, that irregularities in the origin and distribution of some of the branches of the Arteries are by no means uncommon. • i • » Of the Veins, The smaller branches of the Arteries are con- tinuous w'ith the Veins. < , The capacity, and also the number of the Veins, surpasses that of the Arteries. But there are some exceptions to this rule : Thus, the Re- nal, Bronchial, and some other Veins, are smaller than the corresponding Arteries, The Veins of different sizes unite, and the an- gles formed by their union are different; most frequently they are acute, but at other times ob- tuse.

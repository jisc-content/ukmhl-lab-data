7 ORGANS OF DIGESTION. • The muscular coats also produce the peristal- tic and antiperistaltic motion> which is kept up by the stimulus of the food. Thus the various contents of the alimentary canal are intimate- ly united ; some are dissolved j others enter in- to new combinations j and thus also'the alimen- tary mass is presented to the lacteal vessels^ which take their origin from the inner surface of the in- testines •, and the discharge of that part of our food which is useless is accomplished. But as, without the addition of some other covering, the muscular Coats of the alimentary canal would be exposed to be torn ; therefore the membrane cal- led Peritonaeum, which fixes the alimentary ca- nal to the back-bone, is continued over the sto- mach and intestines, forming their external cover- ing, by means of which the alimentary canal is enabled to resist over-distention from air or fae- ces. There is still another property, which is indis- pensably necessary to the alimentary canal, viz. a power of accommodating its capacity to the quantity of its contents. This is provided for by the elasticity and expansive power of all the coats, owing to the introduction of a quantity of loose cellular substance between the muscular and villous coats, and also to the loose manner in which the stomach and intestines are fixed to the body.

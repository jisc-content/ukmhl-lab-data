OUTLINES OF ANATOMT. 44 Sect.IX. OF THE GULLET. The Gullet, or Oesophagus, is a musculo-mem- branaceous canal, connected loosely to the neigh- bouring parts, which extends between the pha- T)'nx and stomach, and between the fifth cervical and ninth dorsal vertebra. It is placed behind the wind-pipe, and between it and the vertebrae of the neck, inclining rather to the left side ; and, from the fifth to the ninth vertebra, it inclines rather to the right side, to make way for the aorta. AVithin the thorax, the gullet is lodged within the posterior mediastinum, from which its sides receive a covering. The gullet then inclines somewhat forwards from the spine, and passes through the cardiac opening of the diaphragm. In its collapsed state, it is nearly flat, both be- fore and behind j but when extended, it assumes nearly the form of a cylinder, excepting where it passes through the diaphragm, where it is some- what contracted. The Oesophagus has five coats. The external coat is cellular, and unites it to the spine behind, and to the trachea before. The second coat is composed of distinct fasci- culi of muscular fibres, * which follow a longi- â™¦ Vide Plate XXIV.

288 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. and freely and repeatedly communicate with each other, and with certain glands, which have been named Lacteal Glands, or, from their situation, Mesenteric GlandsÂ» There are small vessels in other parts of the body, which are similar to the Lacteal Vessels as to structure and office; and these have been named Lymphatic Vessels, as they are filled by Lymph. The Lymphatic Vessels are proper to every part of the body ; and though those of the human Brain have not been seen or represented by any author excepting Mascagni, still, there is no reason to doubt of their existence. In every part of the absorbent system, there are Valves ; but these are not equally numerous; for, in some of the vessels, there are four or five pairs of Valves in the space of an inch ; but, in others, not above one pair in the same space. These Valves perform their office with very great accuracy, even after death. They support the pressure of a column of quicksilver, without giving way, and prevent its retrograde course. The greater number of the Lymphatic Vessels follow the same course as the Arteries and Veins, but are more numerous than these; and they pass through Glands, which, in all respects, re- semble the Lacteal Glands.

OF ASSIMILATION AND NUTRITION. 3S9 I shall therefore content myself by stating a few facts relative to this important subject. 1. During infancy and youth, as the supply of nourishment exceeds the waste, the bulk of the body increases; but during manhood, the supply only equals the waste, whilst in old age the waste exceeds the supply ; many of the smaller vessels become impervious, the fluids bear a less propor- tion to the solids, and the body shrinks and de- cays. 2. Every organ of Assimilation or Secretion produces upon the Blood a specific change. Thus the Liver forms the Bile, the Stomach the Gastric Juice, and the Testes the Semen, &c. 3. Substances which cannot be acted upon by the organs of Assimilation, or which have a strong chemical attraction for the fluids prepared by the organs of Assimilation, continue, in some cases, to show their specific qualities. Thus, the urine is tainted when asparagus, onions, or turpentine, have been taken into the'Stomach ; or, thus, mad- der is combined with the phosphat of lime of the bones, to which it communicates a red colour. 4. But as changes similar to those produced by the organs of Assiiiillation, do not take place out of the body, the process of Assimilation cannot be compared to a chemical process, as it is in part the result of the action of the living principle. Lastly. The process of Assimilation goes on for a certain time only, as the several organs of the body become, in process of time, incapable of

121 of THE GASTRIC JUICE. has no effect upon the living. This inference may appear to some contradicted, by an experi- ment of Dr Stevensâ€™s, who inclosed a living leech within a silver hollow ball, which the stone-eater swallowed. Upon examining the leech within the hollow, sphere, after it had passed through the alimentary canal of the stone-eater, it was found to be nearly dissolved ; for nothing remained ex- cept a viscid black mass. This experiment, though ingenious, is not per- fectly conclusive of the fact in question, as the leech w'as probably killed wdthin the Stomach, and afterwards acted upon by the Gastric juice, like dead animal substances. The Gastric juice possesses another very remark- able property *, it is antiseptic, and arrests the pro- cess of putrefaction in substances in which it had begun. The food within the stomach is exposed to the ninety-seventh degree of heat of Fahrenheit; is intimately blended with the juices of that or- gan, and exposed to the muscular action of that organ ; by which it loses its tenacity, becomes of an ash colour, then gelatinous, and is converted in- to a grey-coloured fluid called Chyme. Of these changes, we may have ocular demonstration, some- times during life, or by killing animals at different times, after feeding them. Richerand has related a very interesting case, in which there was a considerable opening in the Stomach, in consequence of an injury. The pa-

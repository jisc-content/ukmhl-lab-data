OUTLINES OF ANATOMY* to two portions of very unelqual size, both of which have their length greatly increased by various con- volutions. The internal surface of the Interstinal Canal is much more extensive than the external, the in- ner coats being folded into doublings, which, performing in some measure the office of Valves^ have been named by anatomists Valvulce Conni- ventes; and the inner surface is still further ex- tended by the subdivisions of these Valvulae into ,very small Villi. By the above means, the internal surface of the intestines is much extended : more space is given for the absorption of the nutritious part of the aliment, and the addition of those secreted fluids which probably have a chemical effect upon our food, and also for the addition of the mucus which defends the intestines from the acrimony of its contents. The food is carried through this long and cir- cuitous route by a series of powerful muscular fi- bres, which constitute the coats of the alimentary canal; and these coats perform their office so com- pletely, as to propel the contents of the intestines contrary to their gravity, and even to push forward air or quicksilver. To this effect the muscles of the parietes of the belly, and that muscle between the belly and chest called diaphragm^ essentially contribute.

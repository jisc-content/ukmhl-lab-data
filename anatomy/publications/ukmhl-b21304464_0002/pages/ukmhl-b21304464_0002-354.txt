OUTLINES OI’ANATOMY. 332 The Heart is composed of a number fine fleshy fibres, which follow different directions; some are extended longitudinally from the base to the apex of the Heart; others take an oblique or spiral course ; and a t])ird sort are placed in a transverse direction. The .direction of the muscu- lar fibres of.the Heart has been well described by* Dr Walter .Charleton, in his Inquiries into Human Nature, ♦ by Senac, t and by Wolff. \ * “ The disposition and configuration of the fibres of the Heart is extremely divers from that observed in all others (muscles.) For here the fibres are neither di- rect, nor parallel among tjiemseives; but curve and spi- ral, and in wonderful manner variously interwoven and implicated ; not by a texture like that by which wicker baskets are made, as Vesalius imagined them to be, but disposed with a more admirable artifice. For, immediately under the outward membrane investing the Heart, from the basis of the Heart, and from the circular Tendinose Orifices of it, in which the Fena Cava and the Fena Arteriosa are terminated; as also from the beginnings of the Aorta and Arlcria Femsa^ is propagated a si rat ton or layer of Caruose fibres, which are almost sequidistant among themselves, and tending directly from the basis toward the Cone of the Heart; where, variously inflected and contexed, they are reflected toward the cavities or ventricles within the Heart. Under this slraUon lie other layers of fibres, descending ob- liquely and spirally; which still more and more inclining to- ward the Cone, before they arrive thither, are decussated, and interwoven among themselves, and with other orders of fibres; Fid.

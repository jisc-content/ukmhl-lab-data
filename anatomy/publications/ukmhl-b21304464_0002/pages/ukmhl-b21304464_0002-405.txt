OF THE LUNGS. 385 Sect. II. OF THE LUNGS. . The Lungs, which correspond in figure with the Thorax, are of a conical figure, broader be- low than above ; convex before, behind, and la- terally, and with the surface next the Heart some- what flattened; and are concave below, where they are in contact with the Diaphragm. ' The colour of the Lungs depends in some mea- sure on the quantity of blood they contain ; hence it varies in different parts of the organ, and is deepest in the lowest part of the Lungs, which contains the greatest quantiiy of blood. The Lungs of such only who have died suddenly from loss of blood, and in health, as the victims of the guillotine, communicate a correct idea of the colour of the Lungs ; and in tlilÂ» bodies of such persons, according to the French anatomists, the Lungs of the adult are of a grey or pale colour. The Lungs also vary somewhat as to colour at different periods of life ; those of an infant being rather redder than those of the aged, and not spotted like the latter. The Lungs communicate to the touch a spongy feeling, on account of the numerous air vessels and air cells which enter into their composition.

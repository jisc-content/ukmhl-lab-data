Ihere are also similar instances in the Veget- able Kingdom, as in the production of Galls from the Oak, &c. Of the Effects of Hydatids upon the Organs 'ivhich contain them. Hydatids which attain a considerable bulk, not only mechanically affect the organ within which they are lodged by their pressure, but, by the ir- ritation which pressure gives, produce still far- ther changes upon it. On account of the particular stimulus which Hydatids, as living animals, give the organ con- taining them, or to w^hich they are attached, they undergo still farther changes, in consequence of an action excited, which perhaps may not impro- perly be termed specific: in proof of which, the organs within which Hydatids are contained, or to which they are attached, are sooner, and to a much greater degree, affected, than by the ordi- nary fixed Dropsical Cysts, whether of the natu- ral or preternatural kind. Thus, a large quantity of water accumulated in the Ventricles of the Brain, in Hydrocephalus In- ternus, sometimes occasions, in an infant, a disu-

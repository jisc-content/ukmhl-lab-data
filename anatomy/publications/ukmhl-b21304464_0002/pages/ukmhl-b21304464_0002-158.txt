OUTLINES OF anatomy. 136 The contents of the Alimentary Canal are pro- pelled by the joint action of the Muscular Coat and of the Abdominal Muscles. Hence, when a portion of the Intestine has been displaced, as in Chronic Hernia, a degree of constipation fol- lows, the contents of the Intestines being, in such circumstances, propelled onwards solely by the muscular contraction of the Coats of the displaced Intestine; for the Abdominal Muscles are of no service in promoting the evacuation of their con- tents. The Intestines of every animal are in constant motion, or perform what is called a peristaltic and antiperistaltic motion. The peristaltic motion has commonly been said to be continued regularly from the top to the bot- tom of the Canal, by which the food is propelled downwards, whereas this action begins at once in several parts of the Canal; and whenever the food is applied to any part of the Intestines, it contracts itself, and makes a firm point, to which the por- tions above and below are drawn by means of the longitudinal fibres, which shorten the Canal, and at the same time dilate the under part. The antiperistaltic action is exactly the reverse of| the above, and by it the food is turned over and over and exposed to the orifices of the lac- teal vessels ; and in cases where the free progress of the aliment is interrupted, this inverted action

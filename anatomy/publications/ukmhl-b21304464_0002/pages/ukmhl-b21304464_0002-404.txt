OUTLINES OF* ANATOMV^ 3fi2 Independent of each other, respiration may be continued, though the Lung of one side has been destroyed. The Sacs, which contain the Lungs of opposite sides, being nearly in opposition, form the parti- tion of the Chest called Mediastinum Anterius, which is connected to the Sternum and Cartila- ges of the Ribs of the left side of the Chest; and hence the Chest is divided into two cavities of unequal size. The right and left Lungs are not exactly equal in length and breadth ; the right being broader than the left, and also shorter ; for the right side of *the Diaphragm rises higher up into the Tho- rax than the left. The Pleurte which form the Mediastinum An- terius, are not in Immediate contact with each other ; for, at the upper part of the Sternum, the Thymus and a few Lymphatic Glands are inter- posed between its component layers and below the Heart, and the great bloodvessels included within the Pericardium. The Pleurae, after covering the right and left Lungs, are again united, and afterwards separated, to form the Mediastinum Fosterius; a triangular space, in which the Aorta, Gullet, Lymphatic Glands, the Eighth Pair of Nerves, the lower end of the Trachea and Bronchi, are contained. The Pleurae are reflected from the Posterior Mediasti- num to cover the heads of the Ribs, the Lympha- tic Vessels, Nerves, and their Ganglia.

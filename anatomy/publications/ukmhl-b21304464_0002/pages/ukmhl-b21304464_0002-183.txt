I I I OHGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE TONSlis, 161 Beside the above various organic derangements of the organs of manducation and'deglutition, extraneous bodies frequently stick in the Fauces^ Pharynx, or Gullet. An extraneous body sticking in the Pharynx: proves a source of inflammation and ulceration ; and a Sac is formed fof it, which, becoming more extensive, proves the cause of difficult degluti- tion. Flat bodies, aS halfpennies, have in some cases stuck for years in the Gullet; but large bo- dies sticking in the middle of the Gullet, have proved a cause of instant death, by compressing the Windpipe. Many bodies, after sticking in the Gullet, pass down into the Stomach, and prove the source of inflammation, and other consequences to be after- wards described; VOL. if.

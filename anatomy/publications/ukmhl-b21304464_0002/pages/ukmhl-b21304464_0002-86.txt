OUTLINES or ANATOJfY. 64< Genio>hyoideus. This rounded muscle, which is placed under the former, passes from the symphysis of the under jaw obliquely downwards and backwards to the middle of the basis of the 03 hyoides. By this muscle, the os hyoides is elevated, and drawn forwards towards the chin, when the jaws are shut. Omo-hyoideus. This thin and flat muscle arises from the supe- rior Costa of the Scapula. It ascends obliquely forwards and inwards; and, when under the sterno-mastoid muscle, it is tendinous ; it again becomes fleshy, and is at length fixed into the lower margin of the base of the os hyoides. This muscle draws the os hyoides obliquely downwards and backwards. Sterno-HYoiDEus. This is a thin flat muscle, which arises from the outer part of the uppermost bone of the Ster- num, from the first rib and from the clavicle. It covers the surface of the Trachea ; and it is at length inserted into the middle of the lower edge of the basis of the Os Hyoides, between the insertions of the Omo-hyoidei muscles.

OF THE MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE. 67 Hyoides. This muscle raises or depresses the tongue, moves it from one side to another, and draws the tongue forwards, so as to push it out of the mouth ; or pushes it backwards, or pulls it downwards. This muscle also pulls the Os Hyoides towards the Chin. Stylo-GLossus. This muscle takes its rise from the Styloid pro* cess of the Temporal bone, and is fixed into the side of the tongue, near to its point. This muscle draws the tongue to one side, and backwards. Besides the above muscles, there are a number of short fibres distributed through the substance of the tongue, which have been named and re- presented by Malpighi and Du VernEy under the names of Fibras Longitudinales, Transversal, Perpendiculares. These fibres may serve as auxiliaries to the pre- ceding muscles, or they may act separately ; and their action is limited to the particular part of the tongue where they are situated. E 2

OUTLINES OF ANATOMV. 326 soapy feel, a saline taste, and emits a watery hallr tus ; and its specific gravity is about 1.0527, ac- cording to Haller. When blood has been allowed to remain at rest, it soon coagulates into a solid mass, of the consistence of curd ; which separates itself into two parts, ///e Serwn, and the Crtior. The pro- portions of the Serum and Cruor differ in differ- ent animals ; in common, there are as three parts of Cruor to one of Serum. The coagulation of the blood takes place in the open air, and also within close vessels ; whether the blood be allowed to cool, or be kept at the temperature at which it is when it flows from a vein. The Serum is of a light green colour; and its mean specific gravity is about 1.0287. When heated to the temperature of 156% it coagulates, and has then a greyish colour, and somewhat re- sembles the boiled white of an egg ; and from the coagulated Serum the serosity may be squeezed out. If coagulated Serum be heated in a silver ves- sel, the surface of the silver becomes black : hence Serum contains sulphur ; and, according to Proust, the sulphur is combined with Ammo- nia, in the state of a hydro-sulphuret. The Serum of the Blood also contains an alkali, which was supposed to be Soda. Dr Pearson endeavoured to prove that it is potash ; but the last experiments upon this subject by Dr Mar- CET have proved the alkali to be soda.

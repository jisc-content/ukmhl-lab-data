OUTLINES OF AHATOMT. 130 The Peritoneal Coat, extending from the Ileum to the Caput CtEcum Coli, retains these Intestines in their relative positions. Upon cutting the Peritonaeum and Muscular Coats at the union of the two Intestines, the inter- nal villous Coat may be so elongated that the valve completely disappears. The turns of the smaller Intestines are retained in their proper place by means of a membrane, which, on account of its situation, has been called Mesentery. This is a flat and broad .membrane, composed of two layers of Peritonaeum ; between which the Arteries, Veins, Nerves, and Lacteal Glands and Lacteal Vessels are placed. The Intestines are placed and nearly inclosed at the extremity of this dupl'icature, and being long- er than the Mesentery itself, have the appearance of being gathered or puckered : From this beau- tiful mechanical contrivance, their convolutions* cannot be entangled or involved with each other, nor shaken from their place by the various or sudden movements of the body, and are also evi- dently less liable to be injured by external vio- lence.

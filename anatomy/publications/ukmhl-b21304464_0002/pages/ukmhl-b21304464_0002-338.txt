OUTLINES OF ANATOMY, 316 Arteries, which come through the interstices be- tween the Ribs. On the lower edge of the Pec- toral Muscle, the extremities of the Long Tho- racic Arteries are distributed. Under the Greater, the Lesser Pectoral Mus- cle is situated. The sides of the Thorax are covered by the Serrated muscle, called Serratus Anticus Major. Upon removing the Serratus Anticus Majori the oblique muscular fibres between the Ribs, called Intercostal Muscles^ come into view ; un- der which there is a membrane, of an opaque white colour, called Pleura ; but, upon the air be- ing admitted into the cavity of the Chest, that membrane seems transparent, the Lungs which were before in contact with it having collapsed. Upon the muscles of the Thorax being remov- ed, the conical figure of the Thorax becomes e- vident, the seeming breadth of the upper part of it being occasioned by the prominence of the shoulders. The form of the Ribs, and the manner in which these are connected to the Breast-bone, have been explained in the preceding volume. When the muscles of the Thorax have been removed, the student should attend to the ob- lique direction of the Ribs in respect to the Spine; and that, upon the ribs being raised, their Carti- lages are twisted ; hence the force is removed by which the Ribs were elevated; and they regain their

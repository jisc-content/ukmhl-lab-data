OF ANEURISMS OF THE HEART. 371 Aneurisms of the Arch of the Aorta sometimes burst into the Pericardium, or, by their pressure, occasion the absorption of the Breastbone or Ribs, and form an external Tumour*, which bursts in the course of a few months ; but, in a few instances, such Aneurisms are filled by coagulable Lymphj and do not prove fatal in consequence of rupture, but by irritating the lungs, and occasioning Phthi- sis Pulmonalis. Sometimes the contents of the Aheurism burst into the left branch of the Windpipe. In a few cases the Aneurism of the Arch of the Aorta extends backwards, and has caused, by its pressure, a caries of the Spine. Aneurisms of the Pfilinonary Artery are much more rare than those of the Aorta. Sect. V. OF ANEURISMS OF THE HEART. The posterior side of the Heart is frequently much extended, or in a state of Aneurism. This is connected with ossification of the Valves of the Aorta, which, becoming rigid, do not yield ; for a small chink only remains between these, by which the free flow or exit of blood from the Heart is much impeded. When the Heart is dilated, its muscular parie- tes are generally much thickened j sometimes, A a 2

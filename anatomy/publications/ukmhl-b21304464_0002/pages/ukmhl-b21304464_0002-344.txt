OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. collapsed in an equable manner, exhibit an exact miniature of the form of the Chest: and that part of the Lungs which rests upon the convex Dia- phragm, is concave. On the left side, between 'the left Lungs, the Capsule of the Heart is placed; which is fixed not only to the Anterior Medias- tinum, but also to the Lungs, and to the middle 'tendinous part of the Diaphragm, by a serous membrane called the Pleura. The containing and contained bowels are con* nccted to each other as followsâ€”The Sternum, Ribs, and Intercostal muscles are lined by the Pleura, which being reflected from the Breast- bone, forms one of the layers of the Anterior Mediastinum ; from which, on the left side of the body, it is extended over the Heart and Lungs ; and from the Lungs it is reflected upon the Ver- tcbrm of the Back to the Ribs. The Pleura of the opposite side follows a simi* lar course ; and a triangular space intervenes be- tween -the layers of the Pleura, where they are reflected from the Lungs to the Dorsal Vertebrce^ forming what has been named the Posterior Me- diastinum. Frdm the preceding description of the course of the Pleura, it.follows, ist. That the Heart and Lungs are so situated, and so connected, that the contractions' of the Heart cannot interfere with the play of the Lungs, nor can the play of the Lungs'.impede the action of the Heart. 2d, That the Lungs are contained in distinct

36l OF SECRETION. Some Glands are composed of distinct portions or Lobes, united by loose cellular Membrane; which are again subdivided into smaller Lobes, and these last into still smaller Lobules or Acini; and these Acini are visible, in many instances, to the naked eye; but, in other cases, only by the aid of the Microscope. There is a large supply of blood sent to the Glands ; and in some instances, as in the Kidney, the Artery bears a large proportion to the bulk of the Gland. The Arteries proper to the Glands are, in ma- ny cases, found between the lobules of the Gland, and enveloped by a considerable quantity of cel- lular substance. The smaller branches, however, are differently arranged in the different Glands. Tw^o very different opinions have been enter- tained respecting the structure of Glands. Ac- cording to Malpighi, * an Artery which has en- tered a Gland, ramifies very minutely through its substance, and ultimately terminates in a hollow cavity or follicle, from which the secreted fluid flows out by the excretoiy ducts of the Gland. Ruysch I has endeavoured, by his minute in- jections of the Blood-vessels of Glands, to over- turn the above opinion; and, according to that distinguished anatomist, the Glands are made up * Vid. his Exercit. de Structura Viscerum. t Vid. his Letters to Boeriiaavk on the Structure of Glands.

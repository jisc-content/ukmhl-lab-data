EXTERNAL OBLIgUE MUSCLE OF THE ABDOMEN. 77 and directed obliquely downwards and Inwards; and the sides of it are thicker than its upper or under part, being formed of the straight fibres of the tendon; whereas, the thinner tendinous sub- stance, which connects the thicker fibres of the tendon, forms the upper part of the aperture. In the male, the >Under Inguinal Aperture is about an inch in length ; but in the female, it is rather longer, and also narrower. To the upper column of the tendon of the Ex- ternal Oblique muscle, which forms the Under Abdominal Aperture, a thin portion of ten- don is fixed, which passes downwards, and is at- tached to the Gluteus Maximus and Triceps Ad- ductor muscle of the thigh, which has also been observed by Camper, and represented by him in one of his excellent plates of Hernia : this, by embracing the Spermatic Cord, proves in some measure a barrier against Hernia. The upper part of the tendon of the External Oblique muscle, passes obliquely downwards and inwards, and is in part fixed to the ligament of the Symphysis Pubis of the same side, and also to that part of the ligament of the opposite side, decussating in its course the tendinous fibres of the External Oblique of the opposite side, so that some of the tendinous fibres of the right side ter- minate in the left Os Pubis. The portion of the tendinous Aponeurosis form- ing the under part of the Under Abdominai.

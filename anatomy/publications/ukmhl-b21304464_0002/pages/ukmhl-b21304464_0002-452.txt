430 OUTLINES OF ANATOMV. xvhere the Windpipe divides into its two greaf branches; it sometimes lines not only the Wind- pipe, but also the smaller branches, and some- times extends into the Cells of the Lungs. The coagulable lymph, in some cases, forms a tube within the trunk of the Windpipe, though in rnany of the smaller branches it is solid, and consequently the air does not reach every part of the Lungs. A similar membrane is sometimes found with- in the Larynx of those who have died of Scarlet Fever; and something analogous to it has been at limes ejected from the Bronchi of phthisical patients. This coagulable lymph is not vascular, and adheres but slightly to the internal Coat of the Windpipe, a quantity of puriform matter being interposed between them. The inflammation, in many cases, is not limit- ed to the internal membrane: It also extends to those muscles which are external to the Larynx and Trachea ; is attended by swelling of the Mus- cles lying over the Larynx ; and hence the La- rynx attains externally a rounded figure. I have also remarked in a few cases, that the Cartilages of the Trachea, when divided, do not appear of the natural whiteness, but are of a deep jmrple colour. The mucous Glands, at the back part of the Trachea, are generally enlarged.

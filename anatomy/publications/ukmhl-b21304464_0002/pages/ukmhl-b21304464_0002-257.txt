235 CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF BILE. A very favourable opportunity lately occurred for examining Bile, which Mr John.Davy exa- mined at my request. I have subjoined his account of it in his own words. “ Healthy Bile obtained from a Person executed. “ This Bile appeared, by transmitted light, of a fine golden yellow colour, darker and richer than the healthy Bile of the ox ; and by reflected light it assumed the hue of burnt timber.

OF. THE ASCARIS LUMBRICOIDES* 209 Ascaris Lumhricoides» This Worm has generally been called Lumbri- cus. it was formerly supposed to be the same as the Earth-worm, but it is very'distinct. It has a round body, and is generally from six to’fifteen inches in length. The smallest are whitish, and almost transpa- rent, when examined soon after they have been passed; the larger are of a greenish yellow co- lour. They are very prone to putrefaction; the largest sooner putrefy than the smaller. I have seen the largest burst in the^ course of a day or two after being voided. The head is divided into three lobes,'which are joined at their bases, betwixt which the mouth of the animal, which is of a triangular form, iS placed. The Anus of the animal opens a little way from the extremity of the Worm, upon the under surface of the Worm, by a turved fissure. The body has a rugose appearance ; and there are four lines, placed nearly at equal distances, 'which pass along the animal. Two of these are much more apparent than the otherj from being much broader. By these lines, fibres, probably circular mus- cles, are intersected in such a manner, that each consists of two semicircular portions. vol; it* O

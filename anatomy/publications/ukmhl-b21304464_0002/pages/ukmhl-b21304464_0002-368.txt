346 OUTLINES or ANATOMY. Valves are also found in the Venae Azygos and Spermatic Veins. The blood gets between the Valves and the sides of the Veins, by which the Veins are ex- panded, which gives the Vein an irregular figure. The last circumstance respecting the Veins, which merits particular mention, is, that the Veins yield more readily ; are much more dilatable in the transverse direction, than the Arteries; but they can be extended but little in the longitudi- nal direction. The Coats of the Veins are also much stronger than the Arteries, as has been proved by the ex- periments of Sir Clifton Wintringham. Of the Coats of the A rteries and Veins. The Arteries and Veins are connected to the neighbouring parts by loose cellular substance, by which they are more readily adapted to the move- ments of our Limb, and readily change their place when they are dilated, and when the pulse is felt. The Coats of the Arteries are whiter, and con- siderably thicker, than those of the Veins; in some cases the Coats of the Arteries are thrice the thickness of those of the Veins. The smaller Arteries are proportionally stronger than the larger ; as has been ascertained by fixing weights to them. The Arteries are less capacious, less numerous, but much more elastic than the Veins: hence

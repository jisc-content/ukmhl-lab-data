OUTLINES OP ANATOMP. 120 Still more slowly during the winter w'hen they arc in a torpid state, and to have its activity again in- creased by exposing them to a greater degree of heat The most remarkable circumstance in the his- tory of the Gastric J uice is, that its poictr is pure- ly chemical; for it operates as poiverf 'ully upon the animalfibre out of the body, as within the Stomach of a living animal; and actually is observed to dis- solve the Stomach itself after death. From this fact, it is obvious, that its operation is confined to the dead animal fibre, and that it * My Father, during a severe winter, (1764,) kept a Hedgehog in a room wliere there was no fire from the month of Novem- ber till March. He placed near the animal boiled beef, bread, cheese, potatoes, water, and straw. About the beginning of De- cember, the Hedgehog was affected with an unusual degree of drowsiness. He, however, continued to eat, though more spa- ringly, till the 25th of that month. From that time till the 8th day of March following, he continued in a profound sleep, except when artificially roused. After being thus roused, he soon walk- ed back to his place of retreat, and resumed his dormant state. On the 25th of December, he weighed thirteen ounces and three drachms ; on the 6th of February eleven ounces and seven drachmsand, on the 8th of March, eleven ounces and three drachms. There was a small quantity of feculent matter and urine among the hay. At the time of his actual revivisccnce, no person was present; and, of course, the circumstances at- tending it are unknown. In the course of three months, the Hedgehog had neither ate nor drank; but remained constantly in a profound sleep among the straw. Its limbs, liowever, were never rigid; but it lost two ounces of its weight. Frogs, w'hich my fatlier kept during the winter in a vessel with water, seemed to be in a similar state vrilh that of the Hedgehog. ;

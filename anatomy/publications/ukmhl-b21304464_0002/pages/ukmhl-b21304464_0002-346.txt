The colour of litmus is not affected by it, nor that of paper stained with turmeric ; but it slowly changes the blue colour of infusion of violets to green. “ 3. Its specific gravity is somewhat' greater than that of water, but less than that of the blood; this, however, is probably liable to much variation, “ 4>. In about ten minutes after it is removed from the duct, it assumes the appearance of a stiff jelly, which in the course of twenty-four hours gradually separates into two' parts, producing a firm and contracted coagulum, surround- ed by a transparent colourless fluid. These spontaneous changes, which I have observed in eVery instance where the chyle was examined at' a proper period after taking food, are very similar to the coagulation of the blood and its sub- sequent separation into serum and crassamentum; they are also retarded and accelerated by similar means. “,B. 1. The coagulafted portion bears a nearer resem- blance to the caseous part of milk than to the fibrine of the blood. “ The fluid found in the thoracic duct of animals that have been kept for twenty-four hours without food, is per- fectly transparent and colourless, and seems to differ in no respect from that which is contained in the lymphatic ves- sels. It may therefore be regarded as pure lymph. “ It has the following properties. * “ 1. It is miscible in every proportion with water. “ 2. It produces no change in vegetable colours. “ 3. It is neither coagulated by heat, nor acids, nor al- cohol, but is generally rendered slightly turbid by the last reagent. “ 4. Wlien evaporated to dryness, the residuum is very * The term lymph lias been applied indiscriminately to the tears, to • the matter of encysted dropsy, and to some other animal fluids. \ ide^ Aikin’i Dictionary of Chemistry and Mineralogy, Art.

•UTLINES 6T ANAtOHir. is rounded before, but flattened behind, where ic is in contact with the Gullet. The Trachea and its branches are lined by a very irritable mucous membrane, which is kept constantly moist by Mucus which is derived from a number of mucous glands, situated at the back part of the Windpipe, and between its Cartilages.^ The Cartilages of the Windpipe are connected by a ligamentous elastic Coat; and between it and the mucous lining there are muscular fibres, arranged in a circular and longitudinal direction. The Bronchi are similar to the Trachea ia structure, excepting in being surrounded by irre- gular segments of Cartilage. The Bronchi are subdivided into still smaller, branches, called the Membranous Tubes, which lead to the Air Cells of the Lungs. Of' the Air Cells of the Lungs, The Air Cells of the Lungs may be demonstrat- ed by inflating the Lungs, or by filling them with, quicksilver, and afterwards drying and cutting the Lungs. They vary in‘ size in different animals, being largest in the amphibia; and^ even in the same class of animals, their size does not corre- spond with the size of the animal. The surface of the A' Cells in the human body is much greater than that of the skin} and ha5 been differently estimated by authors.

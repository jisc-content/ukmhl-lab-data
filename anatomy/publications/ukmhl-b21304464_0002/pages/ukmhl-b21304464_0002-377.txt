OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD. S36 That the pulse is not owing to the contraction of the Coats of the Artery, has been fully proved by Vesalius’s Experiments. * lo. The arteries divide, like a tree, into va- rious branches, most of which are sent off at acute angles; and these branches are subdivided into still smaller branches. If the laws of hydraulics are applicable to the arterial system, the blood, in consequence of its viscidity, of friction, of the angles and anasto- moses of the arteries, of mechanical pressure, and the greater area of the branches than of the parent trunk, should flow much more slowly in the small- er than in the larger trunks of the arteries. The above holds true with regard'to water cgn- talned in metalline tubes ; but perhaps not with regard to blood circulating through the muscular and elastic blood-vessels of a living animal: An opinion which gains weight from the experiments of Haller f and Spallanzani ; | who have ^ stated, that they remarked the blood issuing as ♦ Fid.

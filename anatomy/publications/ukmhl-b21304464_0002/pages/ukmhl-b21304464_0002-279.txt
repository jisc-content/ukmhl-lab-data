257 TUMOURS OF THE LIVER. generally transparent and colourless; is to the taste slightly salt; and in some instances, a part of it is coagulated by heat, or by the addition of acids, or ardent spirits. In some cases, the contents of the Cyst are tinged with yellow, which is probably owing to -cm admixture of bile, exuding after death ; for the yellow colour is observed only in Hydatids which are connected with the Liver and Gall- Bladder. There are also Tumours, the contents of which seem to be Coagulable Lymph, and a number of Hydatids which have burst; and the Coats of those are shrunk and inverted. ' There is a seventh kind of Hydatids, with nar- row necks, which is frequently attached to the Pla- centa. I have also seen Hydatids of the second species connected with the Placenta. Some of the bowels, as the Ovaria and Kidneys, are said at times to have been converted into Hy- datids j but it would be more accurate to speak of the conversion of these bowels into watery vesi- cles, (the genuine Hydatid being rarely found within these bowels) ; and these Vesicles have only one Coat; they are not enclosed within firm Cysts, and do not produce their like ; nor do they one hundredth part of an inch in diameter, and the small- est being less than a red globule of the blood.

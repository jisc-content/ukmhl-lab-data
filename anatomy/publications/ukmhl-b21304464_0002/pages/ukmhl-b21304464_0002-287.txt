265 EFFECTS OF HYDATIDS. nion of the Bones of the Cranium from each o- ther, and the head acquires an unnatural bulk. No part of the Cranium becomes soft, thin, or is absorbed. But if Hydatids are lodged in one of the Ventricles of the Brain, (which is not un- common in Sheep), the Cranium over that Ven- tricle becomes soft, and may be cut without turn- ing the edge of the knife, and loses considerably of its thickness ; and in some cases holes are formed in it, although the Dura Mater remains entire between the Cranium and the Brain ; and even although the Cyst containing the Hydatids is still covered by a seemingly sound portion of the Brain and Pia Mater. The same happens in the human body ; for in the case stated, * where a Hydatid, of the size ' of a gooseâ€™s egg, was found in the right Ventricle of the Brain of a man, covered by a Gelatinous matter, without any fibrous adhesion to the mem- brane lining the Ventricle, the Cranium was found to be much thinner on its right side than on the left; and, in particular, the Right Parietal Bone was not thicker than a wafer. In like manner, the Pleura, Peritonseum, and Vaginal Coat of the Testis, have been greatly ex- tended for a length of time, but the containing membrane continues entire ; whereas, when Hy- datids are collected within these membranes, a * Fid.

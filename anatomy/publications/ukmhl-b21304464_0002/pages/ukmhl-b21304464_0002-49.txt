27 OF THE TEETH. It has been stated, that in a child at birth the depth of the jaw is about the seventh part of that of the head ; at the age of', thirty, it measures somewhat less than the fifth part. As the teeth advance, the posterior angle of the jaw is pushed back, and becomes more nearly a right angle; and the posterior part of the rising branch, which was at first very oblique, becomes straight. From what has been said respecting the teeth, it is obvious, that as the incisor teeth and grind- ing teeth of the child are at first in immediate contact; that the jaw must grow rapidly in order to make room for the eye teeth ; and, as the grinding teeth of the second set are more nume- rous than those of the first, the jaws must extend very much between the coronoid process and the grinders of the first set, to make way for the grinders of the second set: hence we find, that the jaws are in a constant state of growth until the twentieth year, in order to make room for the addition of the wisdom teeth. When the teeth fall out, the alveolar processes disappear in the upper, as well as in the under jaw. We sometimes observe an osseous network which fills up some of the alveolar processes; and the distance betwâ€™een the bony palate and th? chin becomes much less. When the jaws are shut as in plate 23d, the under jaw projects considerably beyond the up- per. The posterior angle becomes more obtuse^ because.it is not pushed back by the teeth ; and,

OF ALVINE CONCRETIONS. lO’o substance is tasteless, insoluble in water, alcohol, ether, potash ley, and muriatic acid. It black- ens sulphuric acid, and is dissolved, being partly reduced to charcoal. In nitric acid it dissolves very slowly, and only when assisted by heat; and hardly effervesces. When the solution is evapo- rated to dryness, a whitish residue remains, which has a bitterish taste, and is imperfectly soluble in water. Nitric acid does not convert it into any of the vegetable acids, though digested on it re- peatedly. This substance burns with a slight flame, and .rather like a vegetable than an animal body. It is undoubtedly of a peculiar nature, dif- fering from every animal and vegetable substance hitherto examined. Its insolubility in potash ley distinguishes it readily from Wood. It has no resemblance to any animal substance whatever. “ 7. The calculi consist essentially of alternate layers of this peculiar substance, and of phosphate of lime. Sometimes the substances are intimate- ly mixed, instead of being in alternate layers. The albumen and brown matter seem to serve as a cement. The other substances are in a small proportion. “ The crust on the outside of some of the cal- culi consists of phosphate of lime, mixed with a brown animal matter. “ In a few specimens, I observed crystals of phosphate of ammonia and magnesia, upon the outside crust of the calculi j but these appear? ani;es are uncommon,

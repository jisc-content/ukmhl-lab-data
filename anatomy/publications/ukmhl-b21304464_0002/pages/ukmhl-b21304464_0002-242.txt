outlines of anatomy. 220 occupies a very considerable share of the cavity of the Abdomen ; and the younger the foetus, the greater the bulk of the Liver. The Liver is fixed to the neighbouring parts by the membrane called Peritonaeum, which is de- scribed by anatomists as forming its Ligaments, though these bear no analogy to the other liga- ments of the body. The uppermost ligament of the Liver is In shape like a sickle, on which account it has been named the Falciform Ligamait, or from its supposed office. Suspensory Ligament. This ligament may be readily seen by making incisions perpendicu- larly downwards from the breast bone on each side of the Recti Muscles, as far down as the Navel, and by then cutting across and raising the Recti muscles. It is thin and transparent, excepting at 'its under part; and extends backwards from the sheath of the Recti Muscles, and from the Ensi- form Cartilage of the Sternum, becoming gradu- ally broader, and is fixed obliquely to the Liver, where it divides into its two component layers, to form the Lateral Ligaments ()f the Liver, which are fixed to the right and left sides,of the body. The Umbilical Vein of the Feetus, which is shrivelled, and changed into a rounded ligament, forms the under rounded part of the Falciform Ligament, Between the layers of the Falciform Ligament, there is a small proportion of cellular substance.

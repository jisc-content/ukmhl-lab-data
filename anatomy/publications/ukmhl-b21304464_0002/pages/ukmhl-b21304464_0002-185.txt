Some of the Concretions, when divided, exhi- bit laraellos’ about two lines in thickness, and a central nucleus j but, in others, there is neither a nucleus nor lamellcE. * There are small cavities vvithin some alvine Concretions. These alvine Concretions'were analyzed by Dr Thomas Thomson, who communicated to me the following account of them. “ The calculi which I examined are of a much more compound nature than I expected, and con- tain two substances, of a nature quite peculiar, or at least with which I was not before acquainted. The following observations will convey a general idea of their nature and composition. “ I. At first they swim in water ; but that is tiwing to the numerous pores, filled with air, which they contain. Accordingly, they soon sink to the bottom, and remain there. The specific gra- vity I found to vary in different specimens, from 1.376 to 1.540. i consider 1.400 as about the average specific gravity of the whole. “ 2. When left in cold water, they soon com- municate a brownish tinge. The water was found to have taken up the following substances : L 2 * Fi(/. Morbid Anatomy of the Gullet, Stomach, and Intestines.

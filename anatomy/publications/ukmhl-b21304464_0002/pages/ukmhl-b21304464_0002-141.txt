119 OP THE GASTRIC JGICK. Brugnatelli informs us, that the Gastric Juice of carnivorous animals, as Hawks, has a bitter taste and pungent smell, and not at all watery; and contains an uncombined acid, with a small quantity of the muriate of soda. On the other hand, Carminati informs us, that the Gastric Juice of sheep is watery, has a bitter taste, and contains ammonia, an animal extract, and a large proportion of the muriate of soda. From the above, there is reason to conclude, that the Gastric Juice is adapted to the food of the animal, and therefore different in the different clas- ses off animals. There is likewise reason to sup- pose, that it is somewhat different at different times, and in different individuals. Most of the graminivorous quadrupeds, when young, are fed chiefly on milk, and some birds chiefly on animal substances. A chick for the first few days is nourished by the yolk of the egg ; and the pigeon feeds its young at a very early period with a curd formed in its crop, mixed with its grain, till they arrive at a certain age, when they are fed on grain alone; proving, more clearly than Spallanzani and Mr ' Hunterâ€™s Experiments on the Eagle, that the food of an animal, intended to live ultimately on vegetables, may, in the earlier period of its exist- ence, be purely animal, or at least of a mixed na- ture. The operation of the Gastric Juice in cold- blooded animals is not so powerful as in other classes ; and it has been observed likewise to act H 4

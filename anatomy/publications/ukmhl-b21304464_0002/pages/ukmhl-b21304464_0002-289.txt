EFFECTS OF HYDATIDS. 267 sion with the containing parts, as was done with complete success. | Plater * has related the case of a young wo- man who had a Tumour in the right Hypochon- drium, which was very painful, especially when she lay on the left side. It at length burst, and a large quantity of a serous fluid was discharged, besides a number of Hydatids ; after which, the patient obtained a complete cure. Guatanniâ€™s f testimony is equally strong. He has related a case, in which the Parietes of the Abdomen over a Tumour in the region of the Liver became very thin ; and the Tumour, in consequence of violent coughing, 'at length burst externally, and three hundred entire Hydatids, together with a quantity of a serous fluid, were discharged. The opening remained fistulous for some time; but at length closed, and the patient recovered. In the same manner, when Hydatids have been accumulated within the Uterus, these may be re- moved from it, as was done by Dr Kilgour of Musselburgh, with perfect success. A Lady was supposed to be in labour, and the Doctor was sent for to deliver her. The pains X Fid. Case 7th, (Art. Hydatids), in my book uppi^ t)ie Morbid Anatomy of the Gullet, Stomach, &c. * Vid.

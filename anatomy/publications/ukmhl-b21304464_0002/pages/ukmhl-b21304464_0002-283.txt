261 BLOOD-VESSELS OF HYDATIDS. which Hydatids were lodged ; also those upon the Sac of the Hydatid j which, where the Hydatid is of considerable bulk, are of a large size, and which, like those in the neighbourhood of other preternatural tumours, acquire an unusual size ; but none of the injection got into the vessels of the Coats of the Hydatid. But other authors have affirmed, that they had injected the vessels proper to the Hydatid. Dr Walter of Berlin supposed, that he i had filled the bloodvessels upon the outer Coat I of a Hydatid, which was contained within the I Liver. But it is not improbable, that he had mis- taken the vessels upon the Peritonaeum of the Liver for those of the Hydatid. Watery Vesicles, or Dropsical Cysts, as they have been named by some authors, are very dif- ferent from Hydatids ; for in these we observe only a single thin Coat, firmly attached to the neighbouring parts, upon which several blood- vessels, filled by red blood, may be observed. Such Cysts frequently adhere to the extremities of the Fallopian Tubes, to the ligaments of the Uterus, to the Choroid Plexus, to the Placenta, Kidneys, or are sometimes lodged within the 1 Glandular Viscera ; and are also sometimes iin- j bedded in the Mammae and Testicle. I have seen i them filled by a fluid of the colour of the Ink of 1 the Cuttle Fish, when these organs have been re- ' duced to a Scirrhous state. i

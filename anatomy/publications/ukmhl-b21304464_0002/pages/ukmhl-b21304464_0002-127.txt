or THE INGUINAL CANAL OP THE INFANT. 105. “ Nature has, however, wisely provided, that in proportion to the danger, the security should be increased. The posterior side of the Canal o- verlaps every day more and more the anterior side ; consequently, when the canal is completed, any pressure against the posterior side, tending to produce Hernia, has the effect of laying that side moreJirmly in contact with the Cord; of forcing the latter steadily against the anterior side, where the fibres of the Transversalis and Internal Ob- lique muscles react upon it. Thus, a most per- fect valve is formed ; and where the posterior side of the Canal is fully extended, it is impos- sible that Inguinal Hernia can take place. “ I have already attempted to show, that where the Gut has passed down in infancy, it may, in the end, come to be lodged in a Canal; but this is very different from a Hernia passing along the Canal for the first time in an adult. By the over- lapping of one side of the Canal over the other. Hernia is prevented from primarily taking place in the adult, by the internal orifice of the Ingui- nal Canal. “ Although, for the reasons above stated. Her- nia cannot often, if ever, take place by the up- per orifice of the Inguinal Canal; still, was there not some contrivance devised, it might happen, by bursting the posterior side of the Canal opposite the lower orifice. “ The posterior side of the Inguinal Canal is formed^ as was first demonstrated by Mr Cooper,

OUTLINES OF ANATOMV.’ S52 the nerves which lead to it have been divided; The Heart contracts in consequence of the pre- sence of the blood, as has been proved by Baron Haller : The action of the Heart is also inti- mately connected with the change which the blood undergoes during its passage through the lungs; in proof of which, when the contractions of the Heart become languid, or have ceased, they may frequently be renovated by inflating the lungs. . 5. The disposition of the muscular fibres of 0 the brain is not directly necessary to the action of the heart, and that when the functions of the brain arc destroyed, the circulation ceases only in consequence of the suspension of respiration; and the latter gentleman also found, that if res- piration was produced artificially, the heart continued to act {’or a still longer period after the removal of the brain. Mr Brodie has drawn the following conclusions from his experiments. ‘ 1. The influence of the brain is not directly necessary to the action of the heart. ‘ 2. When the brain is injured or removed, the action of the heart ceases, only because respiration is under its in- fluence ; and if, under these circumstances, respiration is ar-e tificially produced, the circulation will still continue. ‘ 3. AVhen the influence of the brain is cut olT, the secre- tion of urine appears to cease, and no heat is generated; notwithstanding the functions of respiration, and the circu- lation of the blood continue to be performed, and the usual changes in the appearance ot the blood are produced in the^ lungs. - * 4. When the air respired is colder than the natural tem- perature of the animal, tlie effect of respiration is not to ge- nerate, but to diniinish aniiiud heat. ’ Vtd. Med. & Phys. Jour.

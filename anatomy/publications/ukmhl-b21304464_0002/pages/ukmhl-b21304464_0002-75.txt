OF THE MUSCLES OF THE LOWER JAW. *73 The lateral movements of the under jaw are performed by the Pterygoidei muscles. Pterygo-Maxillaris Minor, Superior, or Pterij- goideus ExternuSy Takes its rise from'the outer side of the Ptery- goid Plate of the Sphenoid bone, from the tuber- osity of the superior Maxillary bone, and from the root of the Temporal process of the Sphenoid bone ; and it passes horizontally, and is fixed into the neck and capsular ligament of the under jaw. This muscle pulls the jaw laterally ; and if it be thrown into action with its fellow, the jaw is pulled forwards, by which the fore teeth of the under jaw project before those of the upper jaw. Pterygo-Maxillaris Major, Inferior, or Ptei'y- goideus Intcrnus. This muscle takes its rise from the Fossa Pte- rygoidea of the Sphenoid bone, and from the Palate bone, and is fixed into the inner side of the angle of the under jaw, being placed nearly opposite to the Masseter muscle, to which, in figure, it bears some resemblance. This is a powerful muscle in masticating the food ; it gives the lateral motion of the jaw ; and, when thrown into action, in conjunction with its fellow, the jaw-bone is elevated, Mastoido-Mentalis, or Digastricus. This is a double muscle ; one part of it arises from the groove at the root of the Mastoid pro*

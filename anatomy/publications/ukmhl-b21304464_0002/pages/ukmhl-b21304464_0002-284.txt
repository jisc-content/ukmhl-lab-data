262 OUTLINES OP ANATOMY. Though' the Arteries proper to the Coats of Hydatids be very small, yet the watery liquor which fills the Hydatid is secreted by them, and in some cases even bone. The Hydatid is probably nourished by absorp- tion, and not by continuous vessels from its Cyst, and may be compared in structure to the Echinus esculentus of Linnaeus ; that is, absorbent ves- sels take up its nourishment from the containing Cyst. And in like manner, the small Hydatids contained within a larger Hydatid, after being se- parated from it, or loosened from the Ovarium in which they were formed, suck up their nou- rishment from the liquor of the Hydatid which contains them. By what vessels the liquor which has been ab- sorbed passes into the cavity of the Hydatid, or forms young Hydatids, we do not know ; pro- bably such vessels exist as in the Echinus. If Hydatids contract, upon the application of a stimulus, it must be granted, that these are under, the influence of nerves ; though these nerves be so small as not to be obvious to our imperfect senses. Of the diffcrpit States in 'which Hydatids are found. Hydatids are found in different states. The rudiment of the Hydatid is cpnnected to the Coats of the pregnant Hydatids *, and appears, with other small Hydatids, in the form of small

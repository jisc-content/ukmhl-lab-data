OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 5S It arises from the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, and from the space between the last grinder and coronoid process of the lower jaw. The fibres of the muscle are transverse in respect to the face ; and they terminate in the or- bicularis muscle in the corner of the mouth. This muscle draws the angle of 'the mouth backwards, and corrugates the cheek; hence is employed in expelling the contents of the mouth, or in blowing wind instruments ; and it is also employed in preffing the cheek inwards, and in putting alimentary substances between the teeth. Sect. IV. MUSCLES OF THE PALATE. Tlie Pktro-Palatinus, or Levator Palali, This muscle arises from the point of the petrous part of the Temporal bone, from the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, from which it descends, and is fixed into the middle of the soft palate, and root of the uvula. It draws the soft palate upwards during deglu- tition, so as to prevent the food from getting into the nose. Pterygo-Palatinus, or Ciramjlexus Palati. This muscle lyes along the pterygoid procefs, and spinous processes of the Sphenoid bone.

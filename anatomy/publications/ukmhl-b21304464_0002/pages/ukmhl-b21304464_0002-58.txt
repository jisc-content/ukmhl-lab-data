The lateral edges of the palate are subdivided into two musculo-membranous folds, the anterior of which is fixed to the base of the tongue ; and the other is fixed to the side of the pharynx; and between these folds the Tonsils are placed. Muscles imbedded within the arches of the pa- late, compress the tonsils during deglutition, and press out their contents. Sect. V. OF THE TONSILS. The Tonsils are grey-coloured and soft glandt, somewhat of an oval shape, and various in size, commonly about the size of an almond, w'ith se- veral openings on the surface, leading into cells within the substance of the glands, which are lined by the membrane of the mouth. The tonsils secrete, in the healthy state, a transparent mucus; which, when in a morbid state, assumes a white colour; in inflammatory cases giving the appearance of a sloUgh. There are also a number of small mucous glands distributed over the back of the tongue, velum pendulum palati, uvula, and in the vicinity of the tonsils.

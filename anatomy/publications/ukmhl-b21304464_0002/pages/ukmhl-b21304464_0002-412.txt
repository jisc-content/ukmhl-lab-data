OmxiNES OF ANATOMY. 5D0 T. he origin of the Internal Intercostal Muscles is similar to thar of the External. Fhey run- downwards and backwards, crossing the former stratum, and are continued as far as the angles of the Kibs. The external Stratum is not found between the Cartilages of the Ribs and the Breastbone; nor the Internal Stratum between the Angles of the Ribs, and Spine. Both Strata are subservient to the elevation of the Ribs. My Father, speaking o'f this sub- ject, has observed, ‘ The chief circumstances which prove beyond ‘ a doubt, that the two rows of Intercostal Muscles conspire in elevating the Ribs, arc, ‘ 1. That the first Rib is so much fixed at both its ends as to be almost immoveable ; and its Cartilage, instead of being connected to the Ster- num by a capsular ligament, or articulated with it in the same manner as the Cartilages of the other Ribs, grows as firmly to the Sternum as to the Rib. ‘ 2. That the second Rib is more fixed than the third ; and the third more fixed than the fourth ; and so on downwards. ‘ 3. That as the Ribs, from the first Rib.down- wards, grow gradually longer, and describe por- tions of larger circles, we may observe, that iii general, [or when we examine a middle portion of the Intercostal Muscles, or a portion half way between the Sternum and Vertebrte, the insertion

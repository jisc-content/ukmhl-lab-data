OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 188 The frequency of the first species, may be rea- dily explained from the natural peristaltic motion of the Intestines; whereas the latter can happen only when the peristaltic motion of the Intestine is inverted. A part of the Intestine has been stated to fall within another, merely on account of its weight; but the case of Intus-Susceptio from below up- wards, sufficiently refutes such a theory. An Intus-Susceptio is not peculiar to any one period of life. It is much more common during infancy than in manhood. During infancy, the included portion of Intes- tine may, in most instances, be readily disen-' gaged, there being no unnatural thickening or inflammation, and but a slight diminution in the calibre of the Intestinal Canal. But in the adult, the disease assumes a very different, and much more formidable aspect. The displaced Intestine is firmly fixed in its unnatural situation, in consequence of inflammation, swel- ling, and the accretion of the parts. Indeed, the union between the containing and contained parts, is in some cases so intimate, that ihe'included in- testine cannot be withdrawn ; nay, not even dis- tinguished from the containing Intestine; * and there is at the same time a great contraction of the affected part, * Vtd. my Grandfatherâ€™s Obs. on Intus-Susceptio.

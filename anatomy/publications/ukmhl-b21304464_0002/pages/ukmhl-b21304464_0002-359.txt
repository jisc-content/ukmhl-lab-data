^S7 OF pulmonary ARTERY. the passage. When the Ventricle contracts, the three parts of the valve are raised up, and obstruct the passage. Of the Pulmonary Artery. This large artery takes its rise from the Ante- rior Ventricle, and its origin is marked by a cal- lous ring ; it passes upwards behind the Breast- bone, and divides into two great branches, through which the blood flows into the right and left Lungs. To oppose the stream of blood from flowing backwards into the Ventricle, the internal coat ol the artery is reflected, and forms three valves, somewhat of a semilunar figure, which yield be- fore the stream of blood which flows from the Ventricle j but which, when it is refluent, are raised ; and, with the aid of a small hard and red- coloured body, called the Corpmculum Arantu, completely obstruct the artery. .'The Pulmonary Artery opposite to the valves is somewhat enlarged, forming what anatomists have named Sinuses, of which there are three. . The opposite sides of the Heart are separated ffom each other by a Septum, which is thicker than the flesh of the Posterior Ventricle, in which the muscular fibres of both Ventricles ^re inter- mixed ; and, upon the Septum, there are a num- ber of Columnte Carneae. â–  y '*'01,.

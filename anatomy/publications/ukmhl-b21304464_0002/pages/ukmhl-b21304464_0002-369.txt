OF THE COATS OF THE ARTERIES AND VEINS. S4-7 their sides do not collapse even when empty; hence an artery, when divided, presents a circular or oval mouth. In consequence of the elasticity of an Artery, it yields, when the blood has been driven into it by the contraction of the Heart; and by the same means the Artery regains its former situation. The Arteries and Veins are provided with an external cellular coat, composed of very fine threads, which connects it to the neighbouring parts ; and which internally is condensed into a dense white layer, which covers even the more minute branches of the Arteries, with the excep- tion of the Umbilical Arteries, and those within the Head. In this Coat the elasticity of the Arteries chiefly resides. The Nerves, and Vasa Vasorum, or the small Bloodvessels proper to the coats of the Artery, pass along this Coat. The second Coat of the Artery is composed of circular muscular fibres ; and the colour of these fibres varies somewhat in the different Arteries ; being deeper in the Arteries of middle size, than in the trunk of the Aorta. The third Coat of the Arteries is very thin, though not equally so in every part j being thin- nest in the left Ventricle. It is transparent, and remarkably smooth.

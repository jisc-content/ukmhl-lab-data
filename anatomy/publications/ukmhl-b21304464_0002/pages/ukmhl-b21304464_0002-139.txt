Respecting the secretion and nature of this fluid, different opinions have ' been entertained. According to some authors, it is secreted by the small arteries, distributed upon the villous coat of the Stomach ; according to others, this fluid is prepared by numerous small glands situated in the vicinity of the Cardia. This last opinion is rendered probable by ana- tomists having observed in the stomach of the Ostrich, glands of a large size, imbedded between the muscular and villous coats ; the ducts of which are large enough to be visible, and are found to open upon the internal surface of the Stomach.

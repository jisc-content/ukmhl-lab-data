It very rarely happens that much fat is connect- ed with this gland. Around the gjand there are several lymphatic glands. ' . ‘ Of the Duels of (he Farotid Gland. Each lobule of the gland sends out a small duct. These smaller ducts uniting, form the large duct, which arises from the anterior border of the upper part of this gland. The duct takes a horizontal direction over the masseter muscle. Having crossed over the anterior part of the masseter, it then is enveloped in the fat of the cheeks, and pierces the Buccinator muscle, and the internal membrane of the mouth, opposite to the space between the second and third grinder of the upper jaw. Morgagni has described the duct, as passing oblique antrorsum descendens. ? Steno describes it as passing horizontally through the Buccinator muscle obliquely, between the fibres of the Buccinator. The diameter of the duct is but small in pro-

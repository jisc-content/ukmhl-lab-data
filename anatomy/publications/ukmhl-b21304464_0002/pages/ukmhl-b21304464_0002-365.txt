COMPAHATIVE VASCULARITY. S48 When an Artery attains an unnatural bulk, it becomes tortuous, as it is fixed down at both ends. Comparative Vascularity, There are many more Bloodvessels proper to the several organs of a young animal, than to those of an old one. It is a general law, that during the formation of a part, it is more amply supplied with Bloodves- sels than after it has been formed. All parts which are active, are best supplied with Blood. Thus, the Bones, Tendons, and Ligaments receive but a scanty supply of blood. A large quantity of blood is sent to the Mus- cles, Glands, and organs of sense. In some cases, blood is suddenly determined to a part, in order to increase its sensibility. Of the Terminations of the Ai'teties. The Arteries terminate in^different ways. Most of the branches of the Arteries, whether conveying the red or the colourless part of the blood, terminate directly in those Veins which convey the red part of the blood. Many branches of the Arteries terminate upon Glands; others in exhaling Arteries, which lu-

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. The Ventricles constitute the most essential part of the Heart ; they may be compared to a forcing machine, and therefore merit the most particular mention ; the other cavities, called Au- rides, being merely reservoirs, in which the blood is collected, during the contraction of the Ven- tiide. OJ' the Vuhnonk, or Anterior Part of the Heart. The Anterior or Pulmonary Ventricle is some- what triangular in form; very unequal internally, owing to the Columna? Carneae, the greater num- ber of which adhere to the inner surface of the Heart, and are disposed in a longitudinal direction in respect to the Heart. These Columnoe Carneae render the Heart stronger, and also assist In preventing the coagu- lation of the blood. The parts which communicate with the Ven- tricle are, the Anterior Auricle, and the artery through which the blood flows to the Lungs, call- ed Pulmonary. The Auricle is situated on the right, and rather towards the back part* of the Heart; and upon laying it fully open, the projecting anterior flat- tened and notched part, which bears but a distant resemblance to the ear of a dog, is found to re- semble the internal surface of the Ventricle; and the Columnse Carnex being disposed somewhat

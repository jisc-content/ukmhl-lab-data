This Intestine describes various turns. From the Pylorus it turns backwards, and upwards, and then downwards under the neck of the Gall-Blad- der, with which it is in contact; it then passes obliquely downwards, to the right side ; and, included within the cellular substance of the Mesocolon, it passes to the left side, across the Lumbar Vertebrae ; below the Pancreas, and be- hind the superior Mesenteric vessels, and root of the Mesentery and Mesocolon, and ends in the bowel called Jejunum.

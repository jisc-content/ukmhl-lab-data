ULCEHATION AND EROSION OF THE VILLOUS COAT. 169 In consequence of inflammation, the Villous Coat sometimes attains an unnatural thickness, owing to the effusion of a quantity of coagulable lymph. This sometimes fills the greater share of the Canal of the Intestine. Large pieces of co- agulable lymph have been discharged by stool, which have been mistaken for monstrous worms. Ulceration and Erosion of the Villous Coat. These are the sequel of Inflammation. The Villous Coat of the Pharynx has sometimes been eroded from the Cynanche Pharyngea of Dr Cullen, or from organic strictures. Ulceration is more common in the larger, than in the smaller Intestines. The adhesive generally precedes the ulcerative inflammation ; and hence unnatural communica- tions have sometimes been established between neighbouring parts j as between the contiguous horns of the Intestines, between the Stomach and Colon, or between the Stomach and the Parietes of the Abdomen, and between the Windpipe and Gullet. Gangrene is also an effect of inflammation. The part affected by it emits a foetid odour, as- sumes a black colour, tears like a piece of wetted paper; and the veins of the part do not fill again after the blood has been pressed out, coagulation having taken place.

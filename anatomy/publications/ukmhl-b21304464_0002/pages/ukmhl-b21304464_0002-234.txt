OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. H12 a part of the appendages of the Uterus having burst through the integuments of the animal. As a proof that they are oviparous, I may add, that Ovula, in all respects similar to those found within the Uterus, have been detected in the Mu- cus surrounding the Intestines. Trichuris Hominis. This species is more rare than any of the above Worms. It was described and shown by my Fa- ther, in his Lectures in 1794, as an Intestinal Worm. The body is about an inch long, and it has a filiform tail, about one inch and a half in length. Different authors vary in their opinions respect- ing the anatomy of this Worm. According to some, the animal has a proboscis, which it can eject at pleasure. According to Goeze, that is the Penis of the animal. The Stomach and Intestines form a long Canal, which proceeds from the head to the extremity of the Worm; is^ largest at its beginning j and is much smaller at the tail of the animal. â€™ The Ovarium, .which frequently contains Ovu- la and a limpid fluid, is a convoluted Canal, and similar to that- of the female Ascaris Vermi- cularis.

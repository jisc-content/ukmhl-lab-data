diseases of the lips and cheeks. 155 X ^The Teeth very often become carious; and this generally begins between the Teeth, and extends inwards, to the very centre of the body of the Teeth, exposing the sensible pulp of the Tooth. .The Tooth is excavated; the enainel remaining like a shell. But the Teeth are not affected by the constitu- tional diseases of other bones, Lues Venerea, Rickets, and Molllties Ossiura. Of Malconformaiions and Diseases of ilie Lips and Cheeks, There are several Organic diseases which pre- vent the Lips, Cheeks, and Tongue, from per- forming their usual action,â€”the retaining the food between the Teeth during manducation. The inner membrane of the Lips is sometimes so much relaxed, as to protrude between the Lips. Chil- dren are sometimes born with the Lips adhering to each other; or with a Fissure in the Lip, or with two Fissures ; and a considerable space sometimes intervenes between the Fissures. The Fissure is moil frequent in the Upper Lip; and in some such cases, the Bony Palate is split, and also the Uvula. The Lips and Cheeks are often inflamed, covered by Apthos, eroded or ulcerated, from an unnatural projection of the Fore Teeth, Scurvy, or Lues Venerea.

TUMOURS O^F THE LIVER. 2^3 Hydatids are of very difl'erent sizes ; some are not larger than a millet-seed j others are equal in bulk to an oxâ€™s bladder. The Coats of Hydatids are generally thin and semitransparent, although sometimes so thick as t-o be perfectly opaque. The Habitat (to make use of the expression of modern naturalists) of Hydatids is also different. They have been discharged by vomiting, and by stool ; frequently they are attached to the Peri- tonteum, and especially to that part of it which covers the Liver; or they are imbedded in that organ, or attached to the Kidneys or Ovaria, or to some part of the Alimentary Canal. Hydatids have also, though more rarely, been found in the Cellular Membrane; likewise between the muscles; and sometimes, though still more rarely, within the bones. There formerly existed a great variety 'of opi- nion respecting the nature of Hydatids. Naturalists nov/ seem to agree, that they belong to the animal kingdom, and constitute a Genus of animals, of which there are several species ; but sufficient observations on recent or living Hy- datids, have not yet been made, to enable us to dfaw up generic or specific characters, f * \id. Philosoph. Trans. Vol. XXII. t The generic name of Hydna has been proposed; but no character of the genus has been establislmd. It seems not improbable, that the Hydatids oftlie liuman body must form a separate genus, distinct from the Hydatids of sheep.

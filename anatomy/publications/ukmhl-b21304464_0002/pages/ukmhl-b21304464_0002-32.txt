lO OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. the human body, and next to them those of the front teeth of the upper jaw. The roots of the grinding teeth are the shortest, and diverge at a considerable angle from the body of the tooth. The smaller grinders of the upper jaw have three roots. The larger four ; but these, from the vicinity of the antrum maxillare, are ne- cessarily shorter than those of the under jaw. The roots are somewhat of a conical figure; thus the pressure falls upon the sides, and not upon the apex of the bone, where the bloodvessels and nerves, enter the tooth. The roots of the grinding teeth diverge from each other : hence the body of these teeth is sup- ported in part by the alveolar process, and the pressure divided during manducation. The neck or collar is grasped by the socket, and also by the gum ; and when this has been destroy- ed by scurvy, salivation, or other causes, the teeth frequently fall out. That part of the teeth above the gum, is cover- ed by a very hard, white, fibrous and insensible substance, called Enamel^ which becomes gra- dually thinner towards- the neck of the tooth. The enamel is not of an uniform thickness in dif- fereht teeth, nor in every part of the same tooth. It is thicker towards the upper surface, than in other parts of the tooth. The fibres of the enamel are very small, and parallel to each other, and perpendicular to the

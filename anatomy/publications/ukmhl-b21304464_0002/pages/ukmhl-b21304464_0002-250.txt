Hence the blood is not exhaust- ed of those principles which render it fit for the secretion of Bile. .

Mr Ab'ernethy lately discovered, in the body of a child, such a distribution of blood. In that instance, the trunk of the Vena Portic terminated in the Inferior Vena Cava; notwith- standing which, Bile was found in the Biliary Ducts, which could only have been derived from the Hepatic Artery. The Bile is constantly secreted, and in greater abundance after a meal. This I learnt from a case I attended, in which there was an abscess in the Liver, and a praeter- natural communication between the Liver and Lungs, through which all the Bile flowed, and was discharged by coughing j in proof of which,

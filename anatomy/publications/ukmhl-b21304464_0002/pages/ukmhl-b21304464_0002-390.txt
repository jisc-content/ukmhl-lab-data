OUTLINES OF ANATOMV. 3GS Sect II. OF ANEURISM OF THE ARTERIES. ^ By Aneurism, is understood a diseased enlarge- ment of a portion of an Artery, of which there are the following varieties. In the first, the cir- cumference of the Artery is uniformly enlarged, constituting a round, circumscribed, pulsating Tu- mour, such as is represented in Plate XXXIII., and which forms what has been called the Circum- scribed True Aneurism. In some cases of this description, the Tumour is of an oblong figure, not distinctly circum- scribed ; and hence has been called The Diffused True Aneurism. In the second kind of Aneurism, a Sac is found attached to the side of the Artery, with which it communicates by a narrow neck. This kind of Aneurism has been particularly described by Senertus and Scarpa. The main trunk of the Artery, to which the Aneurism is attached, sometimes preser\es its natural size; but, on other occasions, is considerably expand- ed, as in Plate XXXIV. All Aneurisms, according to Scarpa, are oc- casioned by a solution of continuity, or rupture of the proper coats of an Artery, which is occa- sioned by a wound, a steatomatous, or earthy de- generation, a corroding ulcer, a rupture of the pro-

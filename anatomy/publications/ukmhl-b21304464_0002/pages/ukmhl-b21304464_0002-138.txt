OUTIilNES OP ANATOMY. 116 « which, being more loose between the Muscula and Villous Coats, has been described by Anato- mists as the Third Coat of the Stomach. The Coats of the Stomach are not easily sepa- rated from each other. The Peritonaeum, reflected from the Liver, forms the External Coat of the Stomach. The Second Coat is made up of distinct muscular'fibres, which may be divided into two strata. The external stratum is continued from the Gul- let ; and the greater part of this stratum is dispo- sed in a longitudinal manner, from the left to the right side of the Stomach. On each side of the small curvature of the Stomach, this stratum forms a distinct fleshy band of muscular fibres. The interior stratum of muscular fibres is dis- posed in a circular manner. The Third Coat is much more extensive than the First and Second ; and forms the Plicae of the Stomach, the greater number of which are dis- posed in a transverse direction. At the lower orifice of the Stomach, there is a distinct circular muscle, which has been called PyloruSy which is covered by the cellular and vil- lous coats of the Stomach, and varies as to form and size *. * SoKMMEMiNG, (dc Corporis Humani fabrica, tom. vi. p. 222.,) speaking of the Pylorus, has observed: * Forma, ‘ magnitudo, crassities atque ostium hujus Pylori ad sequentes • tres varietates proecipuas redigi possunt: Interdum integer qui-

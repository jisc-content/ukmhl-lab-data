or THE FUNCTIONS OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. 295 A poison which has entered one part of the Lymphatic System, is rapidly conveyed into the blood, producing, in its course, a swelling of the Lymphatic Glands, between the place where it was received and the heart, which points out the source and manner in which diseases are propa- gated. A Blister, for example, applied to the neck, does not occasion a swelling of the Lymphatic Glands immediately above it: those glands only are affected which are situated between it and the Heart; and the course of the Lymphatic Vessels may readily be traced, as the Coats have fre- quently been considerably thickened, in conse- quence of the stimulus. ' A venereal infection, in the same manner, cre- ates a swelling of the upper cluster of the Ingui- nal Glands, though the inferior cluster be equal- ly near to the place of the infection, and receives Nerves and Bloodvessels from the same sources j whereas a confirmed Pox, connected with Nodes or Ulceration on the Tibia, occasions a swelling of the lower cluster of Inguinal Glands. If a nurse, or the child she suckles, is afflicted by the Venereal disease, the one readily commu- nicates the disease to the other. ' It is frequently of moment to discover which has been originally in fault. The Lymphatic Glands which are affected determine the point. If the Axillary Glands are affected, the disease has probably originated from the child j but, if

,1 OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD. 357 â–  blood to follow a particular course. By means of the contraction of the Auricles, the blood flows into the Ventricles, from which it is propelled into the two great Arteries ; and its reflux is pre- vented by the Valves placed between the Auricles and Ventricles, and at the mouths of the Pulmo- nary Artery and Aorta. The different effects of pressure upon an Artery and Vein afford incontrovertible evidence of the circulation of the blood. A ligature thrown around the Humeral Artery, prevents the flow of Blood to the fingers,' and causes also a swelling of the artery between the ligature and the Heart.v There is at the same time a swelling of the Veins between the ligature and the Fingers ; the return of the Blood towards the Heart being impeded. The circulation of the Blood is visible by the aid of the microscope; it may be imitated by an injection thrown into the arteries ; and it is also proved by the loss of Blood an animal sustains by opening an artery. 14. One of the most important uses of the cir- culation is the distribution of nourishment to every part of the body.

OP THE ANTERIOR VENTRICLE, &C. 333 like the teeth of a comb, have hence been named Musculi Pectinati of the Auricle. ' t The greater share of the Auricle is smooth, and has been named the Sinus, which seems to be the continuation of the large veins through which the blood flows into the Auricle, called Vena: Cavae. The muscular flesh of the Auricle is much thinner than that of the Ventricle, as the Auricle, by its contraction, merely propels the blood into the'Ventricle. In the quadruped, there is a distinct projection of that part of the Auricle, which intervenes be- tween the entrance of the Vena Cava Superior, and Vena Cava Inferior : This has been named by Lower, Tuberculum j and the same name has been transferred to the corresponding portion of the human Auricle. The partition between the Auricles is semi- transparent; and in the adult, towards its middle, an oval-shaped depression has been described, but it is rather of a circular form. There is sometimes a small aperture in the up- per part of this depression, even in the adult; though generally there is no such aperture. This depression or fossa is bounded by a portion of muscle, which at its upper part has thick edges, and which has been described by Viessens under the name of Isthmus. The Venae Cav^E and also the Coronary Vein discharge their blood into the Anterior Auricle ;

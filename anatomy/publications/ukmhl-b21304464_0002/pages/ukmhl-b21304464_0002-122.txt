100 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. we expose fairly the degree of obliquity of the Cord» “ If we examine, in a similar way, subjects of different ages, we find that the older they become, till they arrive near the age of puberty, so much^ the longer does the Inguinal Canal become. “ It may here be worth while to Inquire how the Canal comes to be formed, and what changes take place on the neighbouring parts. As I have already mentioned, the upper and lower openings of the Foetal Ring are opposite to each other, and so very little distant the one from the other, that there is hardly a palpable space between them. The Ring is placed just In contact with the tuber- cle of the Pubes. From this fact, it must at first sight appear, that the lower outlet is In the Foetus, in the same spot which it is afterwards to occupy in the adult. In proportion, therefore, as the Foetal Ring is changed into the Adult Canal, it is the interrml orifice which changes its position ; it is the upper opening which mounts toward the Spine of the Ilium. We may from this very rea- dily understand, that it is from the gradual exten^ sion of the Transversalis Fascia, in that direction, that the Cord comes to be enclosed in a Canal. A very simple contrivance gives a very clear idea of the manner in which the Inguinal Canal is formed. Let any one take two slips of paper of the same length, and cut two small holes in the centre of each ; let him then lay these holes op- posite to each other, and pass through them a quill

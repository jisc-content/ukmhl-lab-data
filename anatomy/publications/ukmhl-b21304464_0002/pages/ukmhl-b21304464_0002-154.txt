132 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Caecum Coli ; the ascending part of the Colon on the right side of the Colon ; the transverse arch ; the left descending portion ; the Sigmoid Flexure ; and that part attached to the Os Sacrum, which has been named Rectum, although it should ra- ther have been named Curvwn, as it describes a portion of. the same curve as the Os Sacrum. The Colon is not of an equal size. The Caput Caecum Coli, which is situated on the right Os Ilium, is much more capacious than any other part of it ; it is about four or five inches in dia- meter, and sometimes even more. It is properly the Caput Cajcum, from the left side of which there is an appendage of a tortuous shape, about five inches long, and having the same coats as the intestines: it is about the diameter of a middle- sized writing pen, having a blind end ; and has been named Appendix' Vermiformis. The fatty Papillae, called Appendices Pingue- dinosae, attached externally to the large Intestines, the Adipose Strata, the Pouches of the Colon, pro- duced by three ligamento-muscular bands, begin- ginning at the Appendix Vermiformis, and which are shorter than the Intestine itself, and accompa- ny it through the whole of its course, until they unite and form two bands at the Rectum, are pe- culiar to the larger Intestines. The large Intestines are retained in their situa- tion by a membrane similar to the Mesentery, cal- led Mesocolon, which may be divided into three parts.

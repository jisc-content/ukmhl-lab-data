OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Castration has also a considerable effect on the growth of the Larynx ; for that of the eunuch is never expanded like that of the perfect male. Five Cartilages have been described as being pro- per to the Larynx ; but one of these is merely the lid which covers the Larynx. Of the Thyroid Cartilage. The largest Cartilage has been called Thyroid, from its supposed resemblance to a shield. It occupies the fore and lateral parts of the Larynx, and consists of two wings, which are united be- fore, and form that prominence in ,the fore part of the neck so remarkable in the male, called the Pomum Adami, in the upper part of which there is a notch. The wings of the Thyroid Cartilage, when spread out, are somewhat of a square form, and are somewhat externally concave, and their con- cavities lodge the I'hyro-hyoid Muscles. The superior surface of the Thyroid Cartilage is connected by a distinct membrane to the Os Hyoides; and from its posterior Cornua, there are tw^o ascending portions, wdiich are united to the Os Hyoides by round ligaments. The inferior surfaces of this Cartilage are short- er than the superior, are curved backwards, and united with the articulating surfaces of the Cri- coid Cartilage,

OUTUNES OF ANATOMY. "rhese Cartilages are of a triangular figure, with their apices bent backwards. The posterior surface of the Arytenoid Carti- lages is filled up by the Arytenoid Muscles. The anterior surface is convex, with slight excavatures, which are occupied by the Arytenoid Glands. Ihe Arytenoid Cartilages are connected to each other by the membrane of the Larynx, and by muscular fibres ; and also to the Epiglottis, by a membranous fold on each side, which form the sides of the upper aperture of the Larynx. On the above membrane a very few muscular fibres may be observed in very robust men, which have been described as muscles by some anatomists. Of Ihe Epiglottis. The opening into the Larynx is covered by the Ligamento-Cartilaginous substance, which in fi- gure resembles the Tongue, and which has been called the Epiglottis: when raised, it is placed perpendicularly ; and where the Tongue is de- pressed, it is pressed down, and covers the passage into the Larynx, as in the act of sw^allowing. The Epiglottis is fixed by its under end, by means of a short ligament, to the middle notch of the Thyroid Gland ; and it is connected later- ally to the whole length of the Arytenoid Car- tilages.

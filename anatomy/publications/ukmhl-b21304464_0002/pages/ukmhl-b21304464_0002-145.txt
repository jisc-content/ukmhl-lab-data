PR STEVENs’s EXPBRIMEKTS ON THE GJKTRIC JUICE. 123 by difFeerent authors to different causes ; to an in- cipient PUTREFACTION by Others to fermen- tation ; by some to trituration ; and, by a third set, to the gastric juice. The limits of this book permit me only to add, upon this very interesting and extensive subject, that the changes which the aliment undergoes within the Stomach, are, in my opinion, to be ascribed chiefly to the operation of the Gastric Juice upon the food. The above opinion is found- ed upon the experiments of my Father, who found that Bone was dissolved by the Gastric J dice of Dogs ; and also upon Dr Stevens’s experiments, who found, that if tubes containing alimentary substances, were not perforated, no change was produced ; but when the tubes were perforated, their contents were converted into chyme. In short, the Gastric Juice is not a diluent, but a solvent; and the solvent power of the Gastric Juice, is different in different animals. In the herbiverous animals, it dissolves vegetables only *, whilst in the carnivorous and fish, its operation seems confined entirely to animal matter ; where- as, in man, and animals destined like him to live both on vegetable and animal matters, its solvent power seems equally effectual on either ; for it is adapted to the digestion and assimilation of cer- tain vegetables, as well as animal matters *. * It seems that, as yet, we are much in the dark as to the nature of the Gastric Juice, which probably differs very much, not only in animals of different classes, but in animals of the

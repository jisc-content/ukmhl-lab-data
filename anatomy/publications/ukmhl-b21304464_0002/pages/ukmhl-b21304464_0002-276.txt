Hydatids, like Intestinal Worms, are incapalDle of independent existence, and therefore exhibit a contractile power only when examined imme- diately upon being discharged from a living ani- mal. The remaining for many hours within the dead body, generally deprives them of the princi- ple of life ; and hence all specimens of Hydatids’ are not observed to contract; and such as retain the power of contraction for some time after being expelled, may be considered as unusually tena- cious of life. I • Purulent matter,' which is sometimes lodged within- the same Viscus, also proves fatal to Hy- datids ; and in this case, of course, they show ncr contractile power. The Hydatids found in human bodies, are dif- ferent from those of quadrupeds. Of the human Hydatids, there are the following kinds.’ •, . , . First, Where there is only one large Hydatid of a globular form,'contained within a Cyst. * Second, Where there are several Hydatids with- in the same Cyst,' of different sizes and colours; some being of a pearly, and others of a straw or amber colour y-j- and some of the larger of these are found to contain others.' * I met with a case’in which’ eight English pints of fluid were contained within a large Hydatid; there were no small Hydatids within it; and the whole of the inner sprface of the Hydatid was perfectly smooth. -j" In another case, the Cyst of the Hydatid contained four

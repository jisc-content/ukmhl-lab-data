<?F ABDOMEN. CHAPTER IV. Sect. E OF THE ABDOMEN. J. HE Abdomen is that part of the body situated between the Chest and Pelvis. * The Abdomen is boun^d behind by the spine and muscles’of the loins, at its sides and in front, by muscles, which therefore have been called Ab- dominal Muscles. Above, by the muscle called Diaphragm ; and below, by the bony circle which forms the upper aperture of the Pelvis. In order to describe more accurately the situa- tion of the different bowels included within the Abdomen, anatomists have divided it into certain regions or compartments, by lines. They draw one line from the Cartilage of the eighth rib of one side, to the Cartilage of the same rib of the opposite side j the space above the middle of * I have omitted the word cavity, because there is no cavity of the Abdomen ; for the Parietes of the Abdomeq, and their contents, are in immediate contact, and constant- ly act and react upon each other. /

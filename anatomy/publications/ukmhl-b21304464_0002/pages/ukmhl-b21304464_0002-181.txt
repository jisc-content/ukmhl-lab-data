derangements of muscles of the tongue, &c. 159 Organic Derangements of Muscles of the Tongue^ Fauces, and Pharynx. When the bolus of food has been masiicated, and mixed with the Saliva, it is put upon the point of the Tongue, which is elevated; and by the Styio-glossi, Mylo-hyoidei, Genio-hyoidei and Digastric muscles, the Pharynx is elevated, and at the same time expanded, in order to receive the bolus of food. By the retraction of the Tongue, the bolus of food is pressed into the Pharynx. The Velum Pendulum is raised by its Levator muscles, by which the passage into the Nostrils is shut. The .pushing the Tongue backwards has the ef- fect of pressing down the Epiglottis, and of thereby shutting the passage into the Windpipe, to which ' the elevation of the Larynx, which, from its con- nexion with the Pharynx, must be raised along with it, essentially contributes. Indeed, the ele- vation of the Larynx is siifficient to shut the Epi- glottis, as may be seen in the dead body, by fixing the Tongue to the Palate. Thus, the bolus of food passes into the Pha- rynx ; and by the successive contraction of the muscular fibres of that organ and of the Gullet, it is propelled into the Stomach. That it does not descend into the Stomach on account of its weight, is obvious, from our being able to swallow solids, or even fluids, with body in-

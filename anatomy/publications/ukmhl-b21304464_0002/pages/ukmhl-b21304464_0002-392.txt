OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. :}To as also Aneurisms at the division of the Aorta Into its great branches, the Iliacae communes. There are four varieties of Aneurisms of the Aorta: i. There is a kind of Aneurism in which the Aorta is uniformly expanded for the space of four or five inches ; and, in some more rare in- stances, for eight or ten inches. 2. In the second variety of Aneurism, the dila- tation of the Aorta is very irregular; so that there seem to be in the Arch of the Aorta two or three distinct Tumours, which freely communicate with each other. 3. In the third variety of Aneurism, there is a Tumour of considerable bulk, which communi- cates by a narrow neck with one side of the Aorta. 4. The fourth variety of Aneurism of the Aor- ta may perhaps be described as a modification of the third; for it dilFers only from the'preceding as to the uniform diameter and extent of the Tumour connected with the Arch of the Aorta. This kind of Aneurism, which bears a strong resem- blance to those diverticula which are sometimes connected with the Intestines, has frequently been mistaken for an Aneurism' of the Subclavian or Carotid Arteries. Wlicn the Arch of the Aorta is in a state of Aneurism, its coats are generally somewhat thick- er than common; and are so loosely connected as sometimes to separate spontaneously, and, as has been already stated, are frequently partially ossi- fied.

OF THE OBTURATOR ARTERY. 9S tion qf the Epigastric and Obturator Artei'ies. These arteries, in some cases, come off from the Anterior Iliac Artery by separate trunks; and the Obturator Artery passes around that part qf the Crural Arch called Gimbernat*s Ligament^ and is attached to it by cellular substance. When this happens, the Obturator Artery, by the de- scent of a portion of the Intestine through the Crural Ring, is pressed upon the very part of the Crural Arch divided by Gimbernat, in his oper- ation for Crural Hernia. I have seen the Obturator Artery sent off from the external Iliac Artery, about an inch and a half above, and in others, about an inch below the Epigastric Artery; and in other cases, even on the outer side of the Pelvis, from the superficial Femoral Artery; fin which case, the artery a- scends along the Pectineus Muscle, and enters the Pelvis, at the Crural Aperture. The artery in this case is placed behind the Crural Hernia. I have made particular mention of all the va- rieties as to the origin and course of the Epigas- tric and Obturator Arteries, and of their branches, which have fallen under my observation, as these arteries are of considerable size, and when divided in the time of performing the operation for Crural Hernia, have poured out so much blood as has proved fatal; for on account of their deep situa- tion and retraction, it is extremely difficult to se- cure these by Ligature.

291 CAUSES OF ABSORPTION OF tHE LACTEALS. The Lacteal Vessels, in their course along the Mesentery, pass through two or three Lacteal Glands; and at length the Lacteal Vessels unite, and form two or three trunks, which accompany the Superior Mesenteric Artery, till they reach the right side of the Aorta, where they pass into the origin of the Thoracic Duct, which passes upwards along the Spine, and pours its contents into the blood, near to the junction of the Internal Jugu^ lar and Subclavian Veins* Sect.IV. OP THE CAUSES AND MANNER OF Absorption. The contents of the Lacteal and Lymphatic Vessels cannot be propelled by the Vis a Tergo^ as the Lymphatic is unconnected with the Vascu- lar System ; nor by a muscular contraction of the coats of the Intestines. The Lymph enters the Lymphatics where mus- cular pressure can be of no avail, as within the bones: the fluid therefore enters the Lymphatic Vessels by capillary attraction* But capillary attraction only moves the fluid a given way within the vessel. After a certain time the liquor stops, unless the contents of the Lymphatics be propelled forwards, T 2

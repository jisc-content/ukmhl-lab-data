drUTLINES OF ANATOMY. l&O Sometimes, though rarely, we meet with a Double Intus-Susceptio. Of Hernice, or Rv/ptures. A Hernia may be defined to be a Tumour, un- connected with a wound, and produced by a bow- el, or part of a bowel, which is not situated in its natural place ; and the Tumour may be either external or internal. * The Hernial Tumour, generally, is external to the cavity uitk which it is connected;’ and formed by the protrusion or prolapse of a bowel from the cavity within which it was originally lodged,’ through a natural opening preternaturally dilated. Hence such swellings appear at the Groin, Scro- tum, Labia Pudendi, bend of the Thigh, and Navel; The protrnded bowels are included within a Sac, which is formed by the elongation of the membrane which lines the cavity from which the protrusion has taken place. Hence the impro- priety of the term Rupture. * Tile definition of Hernia given by Boerhaave in his Prsclectiones Academica;, of which Haller was the Edi- tor, is a very good one.

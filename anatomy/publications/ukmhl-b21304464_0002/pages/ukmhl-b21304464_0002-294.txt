The second class are of a yellowish green co- lour, and are in form polygonal. * We frequently meet with a great many such Calculi in the Gall-Bladder, of different sizes. Such Calculi, when broken, are found to be composed of an external crust; and from their centre there are a number of shining radiated plates, which in a few places are intersected by the dark coloured brown substance above de- scribed.

Such Calculi are soluble in oil of Turpentine * Fid. Plate XXXII.

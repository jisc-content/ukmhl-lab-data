Hence, calculating on the supposition, that the muscular fibre, in action, shortens itself one-fifth of its length, it will be found, that the Intercostal Mus- cles, in consequence of their obliquity, produce a greater motion of the Ribs than perpendicuHr muscles could have done, nearly in the propor- tion of 35 to 12. ‘ The only point remaining to be explained, is, why nature hath formed two layers of Intercostal Muscles decussating each other. *■ The purpose of this, I apprehend, is to render the motion of the Rib upwards as direct as pos- sible, and to prevent it from being drawn or pres- ed forwards upon the Sternum, or backwards upon the Vertebrae, so much as, by its friction, to interrupt the freedom of its motion. ‘ Upon the whole, by the obliquity of the In- tercostal Muscles, the motion of the Ribs is very much greater than could have been performed by straight muscles plaqed betw'een them. At the same time, by their consisting of two layers, or two muscles decussating and balancing each other, the motion of the Ribs, upwards and downwards, is as direct, and with as little friction, as if it had been performed by straight or perpendicular muscle?. *

318 OUTUKES OF ANATOMY. Of the Female Mammae. The Mammae, or Breasts, are of a hemisphe- rical shape, and adhere to the anterior part of the Greatef Pectoral Muscle, by means of cellular substance. The breasts of the male are termed Mamillae. The fize of the Breasts is very various at dif- ferent periods of life. At birth they are large, and equal in size in both sexes; and a small quantity of a mucous fluid may then be squeezed out of them in cither sex. A short time before, or about the period of Puberty, they grow rapidly in the female. At the approach of the Menses, the Breasts en- large ; and, at the cessation of the Menses, shrink. The Mammse attain a large size towards the latter months of utero-gestation j and, from their weight, become pendulous while a woman is a nurse; the cellular substance uniting the Gland to the Pectoral Muscle, being much elongated. The Mammae of some savage nations, as the Hottentots, are frequently so long, that the mo- ther can suckle her child whilst she carries it on her back. The Mammx are composed of glandular folli- cles, lactiferous ducts, fat, bloodvessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels.

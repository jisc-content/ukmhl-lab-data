OF THE CRURAL SHEATH. 63 protruded. A continued tendinous membrane lines the internal parts; for the internal or poste- rior margin of the Crural Arch - is intimately in- terwoven with the tendinous fascia which covers the Iliacus internus and Psoas Magnus Muscles, which is connected to the Crista of the Ilium, to the Linea Ilio-pectinea and Ligament of the Pu- bes ; also with that fascia, or rather membrane, which covers the transverse muscles, as far as that part of the thigh where the anterior Iliac Ar- tery and Vein emerge from the Pelvis : Thus, the Crural Arch is firmly bound dovrn, and the bow^- els can be protruded only through the Crural aperture. Of the Crural Sheath. A part of the Iliac Pascia passes behind the Crural vessels, and is firmly united to the Ptibal part of the Fascia lata, forming the posterior part of the Crural sheath ; and the Crural vessels are covered anteriorly by the Fascia Transversalis, Crural Arch, and Cellular substance. Thus, the beginning of the Crural Sheath is formed, and the above Fasciae unite at the sides, and form the lateral portions of the sheath. The Anterior Iliac Artery and Vein are closely enveloped by the same kind of Cellular sheath as the other Arteries and Veins of the body; which sheath is firmly fixed to the inner edge of the .Crural Arch by short Cellular threads j and be- F 2

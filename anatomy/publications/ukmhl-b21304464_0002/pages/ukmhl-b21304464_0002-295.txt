273 BILIARY CALCULI. and heated alcohol; but as the alcohol cools, the matter is deposited in brilliant plates. The fourth class comprehends such Biliary Calculi as are not soluble in alcohol or oil of tur- pentine ; they do not emit flame, but become red. There is a fifth, but very rare, kind of Biliary Calculi, which, as far as I know, has not been de- scribed: which is of a jet black colour ; of a shin- ing appearance, and seldom attains a large size ; and is very irregular on the surface. I have never seen such Calculi but in the Ductus Com- munis Choledochus. Biliary Calculi, of the size of an egg, have sometimes worked their way into the Colon, and have also been discharged by stool; or have work- ed their way through fistulous openings on the surface of the Abdomen. I have described such a case ; * and was ,so fortunate as to prevail upon my friend, Mr John Davy, to examine one of the Calculi which had been discharged. “ The substance you favoured me with, resem- bles Biliary Calculi as much in its chemical, as you observed it did in its physical, properties. “ From my experiments, made on a small scale, it appears to be insoluble in water; but soluble in the sulphuric, muriatic, and nitric acids, and in ammonia. * Vid.

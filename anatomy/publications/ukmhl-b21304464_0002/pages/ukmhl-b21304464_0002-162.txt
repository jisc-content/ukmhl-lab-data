OUTLIKES OF ANATOMT. 140 Intestinum Currum, commonly called Intestinum Rectum. The bowel commonly called Rectum,'is fixed by the doubled Peritonaeum, or Mesorectum to the Os Sacrum, which is concave towards the Pelvis ; and hence I have ventured to call it Curvum, in- stead of Rectum. The Peritonaeum covers the sides and anterior part of this bowel, and is then reflected upon the posterior and inferior part of the Bladder of the male, and in women upon the upper part of the posterior surface of the Vagina. Beyond this reflection of the Peritonaeum, the Rectum continues its course downw^ards for two inches, and is united to the vesiculae seminales by cellular substance and prostate gland, and in the female to the vagina. The Muscular Fibres of it are thick and strong, and extend uniformly over the surface of the in- testine. The extremity of this bowel, which is amply supplied with Mucous Glands, is somewdiat con- tracted, serving in a degree to assist the Sphincter in retaining the faeces. The Anus is surrounded by Fat and Cellular substance, by which the Rectum may be consi- derably dilated, and the Mucus Follicles around the verge of the Anus prevent it from being irri- tated.

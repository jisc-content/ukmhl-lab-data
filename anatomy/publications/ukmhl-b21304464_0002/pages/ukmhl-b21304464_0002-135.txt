OF THE STOMACH. 113 present quite obvious, though the Stomach has been preserved for eighteen months in spirits. From the manner in which Mr Home has exp res-, sed himself respecting the formation of the Hu- man Stomach, and its division into two parts by a stricture, it is impossible to decide, whether he mijans to affirm, that the formation of the Stomach which he has described be the natural one, or only accidental; and if accidental, whether generally or only occasionally, to be met with ; as in the same paper, published in the Lond. Fhil. I’rans. Part 2. for J807, he has asserted each of these po- sitions*. I must beg leave, notwithstanding the great respect I entertain for Mr Home’s talents and skill as an anatomist, to differ from him as to the first position he has laid down, that the PIu- man Stomach is divided into a Cardiac and aPylo-* ric portion*, and in this 1 am supported, not only * “ The Human Stomach is divided into a Cardiac and Py- loric portion, by a muscular contraction, similar to those of other animals; and as this circumstance has not before been taken notice of, it may be necessary to be more particular in describing it." r. 170. “ Since that time I have taken every opportunity of e.xamining the Human Stomach after death, and find that this contraction, to a greater or less degree, is very generally met with." P. 171'. “ It (the Human Stomach) is occasionally divided by a muscular contraction into two portions; these are in shape, and relative size, sometimes similar to those of the Beaver; at others to those of the Plorse."

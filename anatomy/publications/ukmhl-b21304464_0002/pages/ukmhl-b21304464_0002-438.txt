OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 41G Chords; lind afterwards the Trachea and its branches. On the surface of this membrane there are many orifices of mucous ducts. Sect. III. OF THE MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX. The Larynx is moved as a whole by the mus- cles proper to other parts ; and its component Cartilages are also moved upon each other, by muscles which are implanted upon it. The greater number of the Muscles of the La- rynx are connected with the Arytenoid Cartilages, to which the Vocal Cords are fi.xed. If the Thyroid Cartilage be moved forwards, and the two Arytenoid Cartilages be drawn back- â–  wards at the same time, the Vocal Chords must be made tense ; and if, on the contrary, the Ary- tenoid Cartilages be moved forwards, these chords will be relaxed. If the Arytenoid Cartilages be drawn outwards, or separated from each other, the space between the Vocal Chords called Glot- tis will be made wider, or dilated ; and if, on the contrary, the Arytenoid Cartilages are drawn nearer'to each other, the Glottis will be constrict- ed or shut. For these several adions certain muscles are ap- propriated.

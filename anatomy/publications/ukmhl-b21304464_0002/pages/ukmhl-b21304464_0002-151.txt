129 â€˜ OF THE JEJUNUM AND ILEUM. are displaced by the gravid uterus, and by the sto- mach when much distended. These portions of the smaller Intestines are very similar to each other ; the Ileum is somewhat smaller, and not of so red a colour as the Jeju- num. These portions of the small Intestines have an oblique direction from the left side to the Caput Caecum Coli, which lies on the right Os Ilium. Of the Valvula Coli. The Ileum opens into the left and posterior side of the Caput Caecum Coli, forming an acute angle with the Caecum, and a right angle with the Co- lon. Between the larger and smaller Intestines, there is a valve, composed of two folds of the in- ternal coat placed transversely; and each fold composed of small internal Laminae. The superior fold is laid transversely, and gene- rally is shorter than the other. But the lengtft and breadth of the folds are va- rious ; as also the size of the interposed aper- ture. Sometimes the lower fold is long and broad ; and the upper one short and narrow. Sometimes both folds are slightly prominent, and their distinction is not obvious. I VOL. ir.

9 OF THE TEETH. . The structure and movements ot the jaws have been explained in the preceding volume ; and therefore I proceed to describe the Teeth. In the adult there are sixteen teeth in each jaw ; in all thirty-two ; but sometimes only thir- ty. The teeth of the upper jaw are placed near- ly perpendicularly irT respect to the skull, whereas those of the under jaw incline inwards. The periosteum only covers the roots of the teeth, otherwise it must have been liable to be bruised during manducation. Each tooth consists of a body and of one or more roots ; and between these there is a con- tracted portion, which has been called the neck or collar of the tooth. The roots of the teeth are implanted within the alveolar processes of the jaws, which are spongy bones, in the same manner as a nail is inserted in- to a piece of wood ; or they are fixed into the jaw by what anatomists call gomphosis. The sponginess of the jaw prevents the teeth from being readily broken during manducation. The roots of the teeth are fixed to the alveolar pro- cesses by the periosteum, which lines the sockets, and is reflected upon the roots of the teeth, as far as the collar of the tooth, where it is attached to the gums. The length of the roots of different teeth is va- rious j those of the dog teeth are the longest in

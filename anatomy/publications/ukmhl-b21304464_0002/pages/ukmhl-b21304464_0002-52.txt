30 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY^ Sect. II. OF THE os HYOIDES. The Os Hyoides, * which is situated horlzon- ^ally between the root of the tongue, and the Larynx. It is properly enough named Hyoides, from the resemblance it bears to the Greek letter v;'and may, for a, clearer demonstration of its structure, be distinguished into its Body, Cornua, and Appendices. The body is the middle broad part, convex be- fore, and hollow behind. The convex fore part Is divided into two, by a ridge, into the middle of which the Mylo-hyoidei, and into the sides the Slylo-hyoidei muscles are inserted. Above the ridge, the bone is horizontal, but pitted in the middle by the insertion of the two Genio-hyoidei muscles, and a little^ hollowed more laterally by the Basio- glossi. Below the ridge it is convex, but a little flatted in the middle by the Stermodiyoidei, and pitted more externally by the Coraco-hyoidei. The concavity behind faces backwards and downwards to receive the Thyroid cartilage, when the Larynx and the Os hyoides are pulled towards each other by the action of the Sterno-hyoidei and Hyothy- roidei muscles; and to its upper edge, the liga- * Hypsyloides, Lambdoldes, ipx^vyfeTi^ey, os gutturis, os lingux, os morsus Adami, assessor, os hude, bicoriie.

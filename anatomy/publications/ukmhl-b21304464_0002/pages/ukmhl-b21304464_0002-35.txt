OF THE TEETH. I3 This fact is still further proved by the changes which the teeth undergo during the lifetime of the animal, which is very remarkable in the ele- phant. The great sensibility of the teeth proves that they have Nei'ves. The Nerâ€™oes enter the roots nf the teeth, and may be traced into their bony canals, and, in pro- portion to the bulk of the teeth, are larger than in almost any other organ of the body *. The Nerves of the teeth in the under jaw, are derived from the inferior maxillary nerve ; and where the nerve enters the under jaw, it is much larger than where it passes out at the anterior mental foramen ; as, during that course, the nerves of the teeth are sent off from it ; and these nerves may be traced through the osseous canals of the teeth. The Nerves of the teeth of the upper jaw are derived chiefly from the second part of the fifth pair of nerves ; and those of the under jaw from the third part of the fifth pair. The teeth of animals, during the progress of life, are much exposed to attrition, and also to va- rious accidents. Animals, therefore, are provided with a succession of teeth. Man is provided with two sets of teeth. Some individuals have had three sets. * Vid. Monro on the Nervous System.

OF THE HEART. â€¢ill Of the Heart. The situation of the Heart has a relation to that of the Lungs ; as the functions of the Heart and Lungs have an intimate relation to each o- *ther. The lower surface is somewhat flattened, and rests on the Diaphragm ; the anterior surface is opposed to the Sternum. The right side of the Heart is thin, and longer than the left, and is hence called Margo Acutiis. The left side of the Heart is thicker and obtuse ; and has hence been named Margo Obtusus by Haller. The Lleart is hollow. It is divided into two sides by a partition j and on each side there are two cavities. The volume of the Lleart is different in different subjects, even of the same age. The Lleart is a muscle of a conical form, cover- ed by a reflection of the Pericardium, and by fat; is situated behind the Breast-bone and the Car- tilages of the true Ribs, having its basis turned towards the right side of the Breast-bone, and its point or apex directed obliquely forw'ards, and towards the left side ; so that, upon its point be- ing elevated during the contraction of the Ven- tricles, it is raised between the Lobes which com- pose the Lungs of the left side, and strikes the side between the fifth and sixth Ribs.

OUTLINES OF ANATO.MY. » } »' ^ “ Such are the constituents of tlie calculi, as far as examined. I have retained thin slices of two or three, and mean hereafter to ascertain the proportions of the diflerent constituents with ex- actness. In two calculi, the phosphate of lime amounted to rather more than half the weight of the whole. In one specimen, the albumen sepa- rated was one twenty-seventh of the whole; but I have reason to believe that a portion still re- mained. The quantity of common salt, and sul- phate of soda, was small. I could detect no pot- ash by the test of muriate of platinum. Neither was there any ammonia present, or carbonate of lime, both of which I expected to find. I exa- mined the calculi carefully for uric acid, but found none. Neither could I detect any uvea. These substances abound in urinary calculi. “ The preceding details are sufficient to show, that the calculi in question are of a very different nature from any Hitherto examined. .They are of a much more insoluble nature than urinary calcu- li. Indeed no solvent exists, except of a nature so corrosive that it could not be applied. ” Alvine Concretions* derange the functions of the Alimentary Canal, by obstructing it. In some cases, the Concretions pass from one part of the Inteflines to another; and at length ' stick immediately above the Sphyncter Ani, or they are discharged by stool. But more frequently the Concretion sticks in a certain part of the Intestines j which is in prp-

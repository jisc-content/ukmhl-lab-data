OUILINES OF ANATOMV. HoO the Lungs as to diminish their bulk, and even disturb the action of the Heart. The enlarged Liver sometimes descends as low as the Navel, dis- placing the Intestines, and deranging their func- tions as well as those of the Stomach. In consequence of the partial enlargement of the Liver, one side of the Chest becomes more prominent than the other. When the Liver is somewhat larger than usual, its ligaments are somewhat elongated and relaxed, by which it falls lower into the Belly than in the healthy state, and seems, before death, to be con- siderably larger than it proves to be upon dissec- tion. The enlargement of the Liver being generally partial, the diseased Liver does not retain its for- mer shape ; so that, instead of being concave to^ wards the Stomach and Duodenum, it is often convex towards these organs, and presses on them very much. The diseased Liver frequently contracts adhe- sions W'ith the neighbouring parts. The inequa- lities on the surface are in some cases of such a magnitude as to be obvious by external examin- ation. Upon applying the hand to the Belly of a pa- tient afflicted with this disorder, a pulsation may sometimes be perceived at the Scrobiculus Cordis, which is owing to the pulsations of the descend- ing Aorta being communicated to the medium of the enlarged Liver.

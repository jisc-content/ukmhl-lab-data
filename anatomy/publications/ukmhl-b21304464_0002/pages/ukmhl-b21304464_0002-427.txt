He has also stated, that Vomicae, the cavities of which are less than half ail ihch in diarneter, are always quite^shut, having na opening into the Bronchia, until they arrive at a size beyond thisbut that those which are larg- er, have constantly one, two, or more ramifica- tions of the Bronchia opening into them, through which the matter in some instances makes its way into the Trachea, and is evacuated without a rup- ture of the Vomica. * That the largest Vomicae only arc found ruptured ; and, when that is the case, there is an alteration in the appearance of the matter-contained in them. The same author also states, as an effect of Tubercles of a certain size, the rendering a part of the Lungs near them red, hard, and impervious to air, the destruction of the smaller vessels, and a contraction of the dia- meter of the larger vessels, which are frequently filled by a kind of fibrous substance.

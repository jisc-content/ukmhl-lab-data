OUTLINES or ANATOJIY. 162 CHAPTER II. OF THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE . STOMACH AND INTESTINAL CANAL. Of Alvine Concreiiom, The term Concretion is very descriptive of the nature of these substances, which are composed of fibres intimately matted together. These concretions are various in point of size. Some are not larger than a garden-pea; but o- â–  thers are as large as an orange ; and some attain a much greater bulk, weighing three or four pounds. The smaller Concretions are of a yellow co- lour, of an oval or rounded figure. The larger are more irregular, consisting of a number of lobes ; and some of them seem to be composed of a congeries of smaller Concretions, and are covered by a white crust, which seems to be de- posited in successive layers. There are commonly only two or three Con- cretions formed within the human intestines, but sometimes a greater number.

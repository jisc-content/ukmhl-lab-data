4 OP THE OMENTA. 241 the Stomach, following the Colon, that portion of it has been called Omentum CoUcum Dextrum. The layers of the Great Omentum separate from each other, and include the Colon, Hence, that part of the Omentum which hangs from the Sto.- mach and Colon is quadruple. The layers of the Omentum Minus separate from each other, on its right side, to inclose the Vena Portas, Hepatic Artery, Biliary Ducts, and Nerves of the Liver, or to form what has been called the Capsule of Glisson : and hence, behind these ves- f sels, a hole large enough to admit a finger readily, f is formed, which was first described by Winslow, and has been called the Foramen of Winslow. I When the finger, therefore, is introduced into this hole, it passes behind the Omentum Hepato- ' Gastricum *, and if, next, the finger be turned downwards, it passes downwards behind the Sto- ! mach, and then behind the fore part of the great ! Omentum ; and then downwards behind it, to the upper part of the Colon and Mesocolon. This hole, therefore, leads to a great Sac be- â€¢' hind the lesser Omentum, then behind the Sto- mach and Omentum Gastro-colicum ; and the Ca- l' Ion and Mesocolon form the bottom of the Sac j 1' and at the back part of it the Pancreas is placed. In a child, this Sac may be inflated from the Foramen. In the human subject, the Omentum Majus, on some occasions, extends as far down as ihq- VOL. II. Q I

In some cases, the greater part of the inner Coat is studded over with these small excrescen- ces ; but in other instances, there are only two or three such excrescences from the parent Hydatid. Upon examining the Coats of very large Hyda- tids, even without the aid of a magnifying glass, very small Hydatids may be seen adhering to the Coats of the Hydatid; which would seem to show, that Hydatids are multiplied in the same manner as some of the Fungi of the Vegetable Kingdom.

The Bloodvessels proper to the Coats of the Hydatid, have no immediate connexion with those of the organ within which it is lodged. The Hydatid, in this respect, resembles a worm lodged within the human body. I have, in several instances, filled,' with great success, the bloodvessels of the organ within A

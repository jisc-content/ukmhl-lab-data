OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. D4 Even ^vomds of the smaller branches of the Epigastric Arteiy sometimes prove fatal. Dr Carmichael Smyth * has related the histories of two such cases, and makes mention of other similar cases, which were communicated to him, in which the patients lost their lives, by a wound made in the Epigastric Artery, in per- forming the operation of tapping for the dropsy in the belly. There is another artery, which, from a variety as to its mode of distribution, may be divided in performing the operation for the Crural and In- guinal Hernix. I allude to the Arteria Circumfexa Ossis lUiy which takes its rise within the Pelvis, from the anterior Iliac Artery, and opposite to the Epigas- tric Artery. I have seen a branch of this artery nearly as large as the Epigastric, pass under the Crural Arch, about two inches from the Sym- physis Pubis ; and it then divided into branches, which were distributed upon the Symphysis Pubis, the fat and skin over the .Crural Arch, whilst other small branches were distributed upon the llial portion of the Fascia Lata of the Thigh, The peculiar course of the veins also merits attention. A plexus of veins is sometimes placed on Gimbernatâ€™s Ligament; a good deal of blood may be lost by wounding these, especially as they run on the inner side of the Crural Arch 5 * Fid. London IMed.

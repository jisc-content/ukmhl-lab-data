S2 OUTLiliJES or anatoMv. wards in the direction of the Anterior Spinous process of the Ilium, the borders of the Upper Aperture may then be perceived about an inch nearer to the Anterior Spinous process of the Os Ilium, than the Under Aperture, the borders of which are in part formed by the Internal Ob- lique and 'I’ransverse muscles, and by the Fascia Transversalls. The Inguinal Canal of the adult follows an ob- lique course, and about an inch intervenes be- tween the Upper and Under Apertures of that Canal. The upper part of this Inguinal Ca- nal, called Upper Abdominal Internal A- PERTURE, is formed by the Transverse and Inter- nal Oblique muscles, and the Fascia Transversa- lis ; and the External or Lower Abdominal Aperture, is formed by the disunion of the tendon of the External Oblique muscle. In the foetus, the Spermatic Cord passes direct- ly through the Parietes of the Abdomen. The internal or posterior part of the Crural Arch is always distinct. It is marked by a white line In the tendon, which extends from the Ante- « • rior Spinous process of the Os Ilium to the Linea Ilio-pectinea, and feels like a tense Cord when the limb is extended ; but, when the thigh and leg are raised to nearly a right angle with the bo- dy, the internal edge of the Crural Arch is thrown into a state of relaxation; which position is fa- vourable, not only to the displacement of the bowels, but also to the replacing the bowels w'hen

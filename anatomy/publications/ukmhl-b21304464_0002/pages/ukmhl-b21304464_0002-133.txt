Ill OF THE STOMACH. When the Stomach has been distended, we may observe, especially in examining the bodies of persons who have died a violent death, that the usual comparison of the Stomach to the poitch of a bagpipe, is not accurate', for it is somewhat contracted towards the Pylorus : in some cases, this contraction is very great, and continues for some days after death, though the Stomach be immersed in water. This contraction of the Stomach has been no- ticed by many anatomists. Mr William Cow- PER * * * § has described, in his explanation of his thir- ty-fourth plate, what he has named ‘ Pwo bunch- ‘ ings in the lower part of the Stomach; * and Sneider and Blasius have mentioned cases in which the Stomach has been divided into three sacs, Riolan, f Blasius, \ Morgagni, § Lor- RY,|| Walter,H Ludwig,** HuFELAND,tt and Van der KoLK,tf have also described the-con- traction in the middle of the Stomach. * F’id.

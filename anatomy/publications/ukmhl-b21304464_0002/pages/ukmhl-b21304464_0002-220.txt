If, how- ever, the Obturator Artery and the Epigastric continue connected for a considerable distance from their origin ; and if one Herniary Tumour pass into the Sheath of the vein, and another e- scapes into the common Sheath of the Lymphatics, then both Sacs will be transversed on their upper margins by the Obturator Artery, and the Tu- mour of the Lymphatic Sheath will likewise have the same vessel on its Pubal side. I have never seen this variety in the course of the Obturator Artery ; but I dissected the body of an aged wo- frian last summer, in which I found one Sac in the sheath of the Lymphatics, and another in the sheath of the Vein. In this subject, the Obtura- - tor and Epigastric Arteries came off by a short trunk from the external Iliac; and the Obturator, in its way to the Thyrdid Foramen, encircled the neck of the Sac contained in the Venous Sheath. J This new variety of arrangement of the Obtura- tor Artery shows, that the general opinion re- specting the safety of cuttihg toward the Pubes, in those cases where the conjoined trunk of the Epigastric and Obturator is short, is not well founded. In this female we have seen, that al- though the common trunk of these vessels be very short, y6t from the Ilial Tumour descending into the sheath of the Vein, the neck of that Sac is en- circled by the Obturator Artery. ** The is a frequent variety of Crural Her- pia.

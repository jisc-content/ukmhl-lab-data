OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 16S Opium seems to prove fatal, by its effects upon the Nerves, and by being absorbed and mixed with the blood. * Sect. I. OF THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENT OF THE yiLLOUS COAT OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. Of Iiifammation of the Villous Coat of the Alimentary Canal. A part inffamed is generally ^of an unnatural redness, and swollen ; but not always so. I have seen the Intestines of persons who died with all the characteristic symptoms of inflammation of the Intestines, of a sea-green colour ; and, as a proof that inflammation had existed, the Intestines were covered by coagulable lymph, and blotches of a deep red colour. The Villous Coat of the Alimentary Canal, when inflamed, commonly assumes a red colour, has a pulpy appearance, and is more sensible than usual. The inflammation rapidly spreads along the Villous Coat, fro\n the primary seat of the dis- ease, and also to the other Coats. Covering the inflamed Villous Coat, we frequently meet with a quantity of coagulable lymph. * Fide my Fatherâ€™s Experiments, Edinburgh 31edical and Physical Essays, Vol. III. p. 292, &c.

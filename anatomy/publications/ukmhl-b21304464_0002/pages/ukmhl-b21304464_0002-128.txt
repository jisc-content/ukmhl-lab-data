OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 106 by the Transversalis Fascia, which is thin and di- latable, and, therefore,’ independent of assistance, affords but a trifling barrier to protrusion. Na- ture has not, however, neglected this point; for, opposite to the inferior opening, she has strength- ened tlie posterior side, by a set of inflectedfbreSy which arise, as described by Camper, from the folded in lower pillar of the Oblique muscle, and run upward, expanding over that portion of the Transversalis Fascia opposite to the lower outlet. This affords one security; but Nature seems pe- culiarly solicitous about defending this opening, and has therefore bound the two pillars firmly to- gether, by cross slips, and made to arise from the upper one, a fasciculus of Fascia, which by winding round the top of the thigh, must, in these motions which would endanger the parts, be made closely to embrace the Cord, adapting thus, ,in a most accurate manner, the size of the lower out- let to the size of the Cord. “ We thus see, that, hij the iiosterior Kigali of the Canal, Inguinal Hernia is, in the adult, pre- 'vented from takingpla.ee through the upper orifice; and that, by the peculiarity of the mechanism of the lower opening, Venlro-Inguinal Hernia can- not occur, except where, by violence, the poste- rior side of the Canal is burft, or the cross slips torn, by which the fillet from the upper pillar would come to lose its effect. “ When Flernia has taken place, the very ob- jects which formerly had a tendency to prevent

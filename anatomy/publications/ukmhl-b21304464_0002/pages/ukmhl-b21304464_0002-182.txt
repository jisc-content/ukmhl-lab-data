ODTLINES OF ANATOMY. verted ; from a spasm or palsy of the Pharynx and Gullet^causing impeded deglutition ; and from animals generally feeding with the head lower than the rest of the body. Such being the means by which the bolus of food passes into the Gullet, it follows, that when these muscles become paralytic, or arc spasmodi- cally contracted, or when any swelling or tumour obstructs their action, deglutition must be much interrupted, or wholly impeded. The palsy and spasm of the muscles is some- times only of a few hours duration ; but, in other cases, it lasts for weeks or years. * Organic Derangements of the Tonsils: » The Tonsils of the young and robust are ex- tremely subject to inflammation. They are some- times so much swollen, that the passage for the air through the nostrils is much obstructed, and also that of the food into the Gullet. This inflammation is often succeeded by the formation of Abscesses, and sometimes, according to authors, by Gangrene ; and more frequently by the exudation of a quantity of coagulable lymph. The Tonsils are sometimes filled by a sebaceous matter. Calculi sometimes occur in the Tonsils. • Vid. my Morbid Anatomy of the Gullet, Stomach, and Intestine?. \

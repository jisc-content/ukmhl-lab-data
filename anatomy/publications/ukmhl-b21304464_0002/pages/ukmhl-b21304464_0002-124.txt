OUTLINES OF ANATOMlT. 102 the Canal overlaps the anreiior, so must the length of the Canal vary. If he take a just and compre- hensive view of these parts, he will be able to see, in the structure, a wise provision of Nature to prevent protrusion at the Groin, and he will also be led to deduce some pathological inferences from the data before him. He will be prepared to understand why Inguinal Hernia is much more frequent in young than in old subjects ; why it is often cured in the former, and seldom in the lat- ' ter ; and why in the one it is a more dangerous affection than in the other. â€œ In the very early period of life, the cord, as we have just seen, passes through a mere ciper^ iure% and besides, there is an open communica- tion between the Tunica Vaginalis and the Belly. From these circumstances, therefore, a portion of Gut is forced down along the Cord, forming Congenital Hernia ; or, if the Tunica Vaginalis be obliterated, a new Peritoneal Sac passes through the Ring by the side of the cord. As, however, the parts are more dilatable in the young than in the old person,' so is Hernia, cceteris paribus^ more readily reducible in the former, and conse- quently less dangerous. The Gut, in the first instance, in the young subject, passes through a simple Ring ; but if the Hernia be allowed to re- main, then in many cases the Upper Orifice, a- scending toward the Spine of the Ilium, as it ought to do, comes in the end to lodge both the Hernial Sac and the Spermatic Cord in a com-

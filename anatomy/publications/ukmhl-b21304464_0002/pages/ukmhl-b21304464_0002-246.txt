There is a large and deep cavity extending from before backwards, of which the large notch in the edge of the Liver constitutes the fore part; which, from containing the Umbilical Vein, has been named the Fossa Umbilicalis. This Fossa runs backwards between the Lobule of Spigelius, and the left Lobe, becoming nar- rower in its course backwards, where it lodges the Canalis Venosus, which, in the adult, like the Umbilical Vein, is converted into a Ligament. The Fossa Umbilicalis is sometimes in part ' covered by a thin layer of the Liver, and thus formed into a distinct canal. . There is a much larger Fossa extending across the Liver in the transverse direction, called Sulcus Tra7isversus; this large Fossa is bounded before by the Lobulus Anonymus, and behind by the third Lobe ; which Lobes have deen described by authors as forming the Portse of the Liver. Jn this Fossa are contained, the trunk of the Vena Portae, its two great Branches, the Hepatic Artery, Nerves, the common Biliary Duct, and many Lymphatic Vessels and Lymphatic Glands-, united by Cellular Substance. Between the third Lobe and right Lobe of the Livery there is a Fossa for the Vena Cava, which vein serves in some measure the office of a Liga- ment.'

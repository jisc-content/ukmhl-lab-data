VOL. II. T OF THF. LACTEAL AND LA’-MPHATIC GLANDS. 289 Sect. II. • / - f OF THE SITUATION AND STRUCTURE OF THE LACTEAL AND LYMPHATIC GLANDS. The Lacteal and Lymphatic Glands are found singly, or disposed in clusters; and are much more numerous in some, than in other parts of the body. They abound in the Mesentery, Axilla, sides of the Neck, in the Groin, and at the great division of the Aorta into the lliacte Communes. The Glands connected with this system are various in colour and size in. different places, and also at different periods of life, being much larger in early than advanced life ; and, generally speak- ing, are of an oval or rounded figure. These Glands are connected to the neighbour- ing parts by cellular substance, and are covered by a membrane of considerable density, upon which a number of bloodvessels are distributed. It has not yet been determined, by dissection, whether or not there are Nerves which entef into the substance of the Lymphatic Glands ; though many of these lye in the immediate vici- nity of the large trunks of the Nerves. There are some of the Lymphatic Vessels which pass through several glands; but others do not enter into one of these glands : hence a poison may enter the blood without creating a Bubo in any part of the body.

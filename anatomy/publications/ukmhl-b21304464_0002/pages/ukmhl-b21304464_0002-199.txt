177 OF FUNGOUS TUAIOURS. Owing to the continued pressure of the Tumour, the Membranes ulcerate, and the neighbouring Bones are sometimes destroyed. Thus, when the investing Membrane of the Ossa Spongiosa of the Nose is destroyed, the bones become carious, for they cannot, on account of their thinness, ex- foliate. Sometimes the bones of the Nose are disunited. This kind of Polypus, when divided, is found to be solid, and in some places fibrous ; and re- sembles, in colour and consistence, the unim- pregnated uterus, and is pierced with numerous blood-vessels. There are a few small cavities In some of these Tumours, â™¦ which are filled with Lymph. | There is a third kind of Polypus, which is soft, in colour resembling coagulated blood, and dis- charges blood even upon being slightly touch- ed ; and, in the old and debilitated, frequently degenerates into Cancer. Of Fungous Tumours', Fungous Tumours have been observed In every part of the Alimentary Canah Such Tumours are generally of a small, size ; of a very soft consistence ; bleed when torn ; and generally are composed of several lobules. * Vid.

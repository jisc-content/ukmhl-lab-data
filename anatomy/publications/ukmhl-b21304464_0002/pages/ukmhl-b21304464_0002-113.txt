Ol- THE OBTURATOR ARTERY. 91 next the Pubes, in the manner recommended by Mr Gimbernat. On the other hand, it frequently happens, when llie Obturator arises in common with the Epigas- tric Artery, that a third branch, nearly of equal size with the Obturator, takes its rise from the common trunk. This may be called the Artery of the internal part of the Crural Arch j for it runs on the inner side of the Crural Arch, passes across Gimbernat’s Ligament, and, when it reaches the Symphysis Pubis, then divides into a number of small branches which are distributed upon the inner side of the Symphysis Pubis. It also merits mention, that a small artery, or two or three small branches, are sometimes sent olf from the Obturator, in its course from the common trunk to the Foramen Obturatorium, which are distributed upon that part of the Crural Arch, called Gimbernat’s Ligament, and which may be divided in performing the operation for Crural Hernia, as recommended by Mr Gim- bernat. When the trunk common to the Obturator and Epigastric Arteries is of an inch, or an inch and a half in length, the Obturator Artery is then situated between the Symphysis Pubis and tlie Hernial Sac, and sometimes follows the same course as that part of the Crural Arch called Gimbernat’s Ligament j of which I have seen several examples. Mr James Wardrop is, I believe, the first

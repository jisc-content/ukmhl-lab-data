OF THE LIGAMENTS OP THE LARYNX. 415 the orifices of Mucous Follicles, on the surface of the membrane which lines the Epiglottis. Sect.- II. OF THE LIGAMENTS OF THE LARYNX, OR THE V.OCAL CHORDS. The Vocal Chords, w'hich are about half an inch long, extend between the Arytenoid Carti- lages and the angle formed by the junction of the wings of the Thyroid Cartilage ; and between these there is a chink, of a triangular form, called the Rima Glottulis. There are also two Vocal Chords, which are somewhat larger than the preceding, which ex- tend between the bases of the Arytenoid and Thyroid Cartilages ; and between the superior and inferior Vocal Chords there is a small cavity, capa- ble of admitting the point of the little finger, call- ed the Ventricle of the Lurijihr, The Larynx is lined by a very sensible mucous membrane, which forms opposite to the Arytenoid Cartilages a horizontal fold, that passes directly forwards, and is joined to the angle formed by the wings of the Thyroid Cartilage. â–  The membrane is continued downwards ; it lines the cavities called Ventricles of the Larynx, and then forms a second fold, which bounds the Ventricles below j and it also lines the Vocal

OF THE CIRCULATING SYSTEM. S2o left Internal Jugular Vein, near to the Heart-j from which there must be canals through which ,these fluids flow to every part of the body.' These canals have been called the Arteries ; and by corresponding canals, called Veins, the blood returns to the Heart, or the trunks of the Veins are inserted into the Heart, from which the great Ar- teries takeitheir origin. The Heart may be com- pared to a forcing machine, which assists in propel- ling the blood through the arterial system. Be- fore proceeding to explain the structure and dis- tribution of the Heart, the Arteries, and the Veins, it seems necessary to premise a very brief account of the nature of the blood, a subject which has en- gaged the attention of many philosophers. The human Blood is of a red colour ; has a ’small in quantity, and slightly affects the colour of violet paper, changing it to green. “ 5. By incineration in a platina crucible the residuum is found to contain a minute portion of muriate of soda; but I could not discover in it the slightest indications of iron. “ 6. In -the examination of this fluid, I availed myself with some advantage of those modes of eleetro-chemical analysis, whidi on a former occasion I have described to this Society. “ When the lymph was submitted to the electrical action of a battery, consisting of twenty pairs of four inch plates of copper and zinc, there was an evolution of alkaline matter at the negative surface, and portions of coagulated albumen were separated. As far as the small quantities on which I operated enabled me to ascertain, muriatic acid only was evolved at the positive surface. ”

The Diaphragm and Levator Ani should per- haps be described in this place, as they have a great elFect upon the bowels of the Abdomen. But as the Diaphragm cannot be seen until the Viscera of the Abdomen are removed, I shall de- scribe it under the head of the Muscles of Re- spiration. The Levator Ani I propose to describe under the head of Muscles proper to the Anus. As the Fascia Lata of the thigh is intimately interwoven with the Fasciae of the Muscles of the Abdomen, and as the relation and connexion of these Faseix is necessary to the explanation of the nature of Hernia, I have subjoined a descrip- tion of the Fascia Lata of the thigh. Of the Fascia Lata of the Thigh.

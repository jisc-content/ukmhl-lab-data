OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 172 surface, and somewhat resemble small warts. This appearance is only observed in the Camp Dysen- tery. In my account of the diseases most frequent in the BritishjMilitary Hospitals in Germany, I have mentioned the case of a Woman who died of the Dysentery, where the Intestines, and especially the Colon and Rectum, were inflamed, and the internal surface of the great Intestines mortified, and contained little vesicles, full of a putrid foetid liquor, numbers of which she had evacuated by stool, some days before her death. An appear- ance somewhat similar to this, I saw in a patient who died of a violent Diarrhoea in the beginning of the year 1766, in St Georgeâ€™s Hospital. On examining the body, there was a great number of small prominences found on the internal side of the Colon and Rectum, with erosions of the Vil- lous Coat in the middle. On squeezing these prominences, a number of vesicles of a mucous or gelatinous liquor, some of the size 6f millet seeds, and others larger, came through the eroded parts of the Villous Coat. The Canal of the Intestines has been stated, by Rhodius, * to have been sometimes obliterated, in consequence of the adhesion of its opposite sides, when there has been an extensive ulceration from Dysentery. * Vid. Rhodius, Mis. Cur. Obs. 508. I have observed the Appendices Epiploicae of the Colon and Rectum much enlarged in cases of Dysentery,

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 292 by means of the muscular contraction of the ves- sels themselves. The contraction probably begins at the very orifice of the Lymphatic Vessels, and is continued along the vessel, in so perfect a manner, as to propel the contents of the vessel: And, in some animals, as fishes, valves are wanting. The Valves no doubt assist in determining the contents of the Lacteal and Lymphatic Vessels, towards the heart; as also the contraction of the neighbouring muscles, and even the pulsation of neighbouring arteries. The muscular contraction of the Lymphatic Vessels may be distinctly seen in the Sea Egg, or Star fish, where it is very perfect: in these animals, there are no Valves to assist in determining the contents of these vessels towards the Heart. By means of this muscular contractile power, the Lymphatic Vessels adapt themselves to the different substances; opening, and receiving those which are of a mild nature, and contracting upon those which are of an irritating nature ; thus the colouring principle in wine, is much more minute than the globules of milk, notwithstanding whichi it is not taken up by the Lacteal Vessels. The muscular power lessening the diameter of the Lymphatic Vessel,* increases the capillary at- traction ; for the smaller the diameter of a tube, the higher its contents rise. The Eschinus Marmus, ,when it endeavours to seize any substance, enlarges the extremity of its

The external is formed of a dense cellular substance, on the inner side of which there is a mucous membrane. There are many branches of the temporal artery distributed upon the parotid gland ; and it receives nerves from the portio dura of the seventh pair. Of the Sulnnaxtllary Gland. This gland is smaller than the Parotid, some- what of an oval figure, and situated between the inner surface of the side of the jaw, the Mylo- hyoid and Digastric muscle. This gland is sometimes continued near to the angle of the jaw; and is sometimes connected with the lower end of the Parotid. This gland also joins the Sublingual behind the posterior part of the Mylo-hyoid muscle. The duct of this gland, which arises from its upper and fore part, is large, and has thin coats. The duct passes between the Mylo-hyoideus and Genio-glossus muscles, along the under and inner edge of the Sublingual gland, and perforates the membrane of the mouth, at the side of the Frsenum Linguce; and is accompanied by the lingual branch of the inferior Maxillary Nerve.

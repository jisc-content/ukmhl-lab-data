290 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. The Lymphatic Vessels which enter the Glands have been called tne Lymphatics of the first or- der, or the Fasa Inferentia\ and those which conic out from the Glands, the vessels of the second oi'uer, or Vasa Efferentia. Anatomists have differed in opinion as to the structure of the Lymphatic Glands. My Father has represented these Glands as being chiefly com- posed of a plexus of very minute vessels; and states, that the smaller branches of the Vasa In- fercntia join with many of those of the Vasa Ef- ferentia ; whereas other authors have affirmed, that there are a number of small cells interposed between the smaller ramifications of the Vasa In- ferentia and Vasa Efferentia. . Sect. III. of THE COURSE OF THE LACTEAL VESSELS. These vessels take their rise from the Villi of the Intestines by short radiated branches; pass for some way under the muscular coat; then perforate it, and join another set of Lacteal Vessels; and form a plexus of vessels, which is placed between the layers of the Mesentery, and follows nearly the same course as the bloodvessels. . The Lacteal Vessels of the smaller Intestines .are more numerous than those of the larger ; and those of the Intestinum Ileum are more numerous- than those of the Jejunum.

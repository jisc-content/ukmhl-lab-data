OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 41S upwards upon the side of the Glottis, and are In- serted into the fore part of the Arytenoid Car- tilage. By these muscles the Arytenoid Cartilages are pulled forwards towards the Thyroid, and the Vo- cal Chords are shortened. Of the Crico-Thyroidei. These muscles arise from the sides and fore parts of the Cricoid Cartilage, and are inserted into the under parts and inferior Cornua of the Thyroid Cartilage. Crico-Arylcnoidci Postin. These muscles arise from the back part of the Cricoid Cartilage, and are inserted into the narrow- extremity of the' back part of the base of the Arytenoid Cartilage. These muscles pull the Arytenoid Cartilages backwards ; and, when thrown into action at the same time as the Crico-Thyroid, the Vocal Chords ai*e fully stretched, or made tense. Slct. IV. OF THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LARYNX. The limits of these outlines only permit me to add a few observations respecting.the Physiology of the Larynx.

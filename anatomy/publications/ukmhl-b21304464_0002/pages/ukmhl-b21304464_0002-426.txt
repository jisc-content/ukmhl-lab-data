OUTLINES or ANATOMY. 464- substance of the Lungs ; and when the Pus is lodged in the cavity of the Pleura, the disease has been called Kmpijema. J he Lungs have been sometimes, though very rarely, reduced to a state of gangrene. 1 ubercle is the most frequent organic derange- ment of the Lungs, of which Dr Stark has given the most accurate account. Tubercles, ac- cording to Dr Stark, are generally seated in the upper and posterior parts of the Left Lungs, are of a whitish colour and cartilaginous consist- ence, and, when small, are solid, and always found in the cellular substance of the Lungs, and often in clusters. * At first they are very small, commonly numer- ous; and, when they attain a certain size, matter * Some autliors have supjjosed Tubercles to be diseased Lymphatic Glands ; though anatomists have not, hitherto, detected Lymphatic Glands in the healthy Lungs; and for the following reasons. 1. Because disease has discovered Lymphatic Glands and ]jymphatic Vessels in many parts of the human body which bad been supposed to be destitute of these. 2. Because Tubercles of the Lungs bear a striking re^ > semblance to the Lymphatic Glands in colour and consist- ence, and to other diseased Lymphatic Glands, as those of the Mesentery and Neck. 3. As Tubercles are often observed in clusters like dis- eased Lymphatic Glands. 4. As Tubercles undergo the same morbid changes as <liseased L3'mphatic Glands ; and, where diseased, as filled bv similar contents.

OUTLINES OE ANATOMY. 27S Sect. II. OF Tms ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE SPLEEN. Injlammaiion of the Spleen. Inflammation is sometimes limited to the invest- ing membrane of this organ. When the surface of Spleen has been inflamed, it very frequently adheres to the neighbouring parts; more especially to the Diaphragm, or to the large Sac of the Stomach. The substance of the Spleen has been said to be sometimes very much inflamed} but I have ne- ver seen It in such a state. The Spleen has been described as partaking of Inflammation, which probably originated in the Lungs, and which affected the left lobe of that organ. Sometimes the inflammation spreads to the Sto- mach, Colon, and Liver. The inflammation sometimes leads to abscess; and, when that happens, there is generally a large quantity of pus, which is attended by a destruc- tion of the substance of the Viscus, so that no- thing remains but the outer peritoneal covering, which forms the Cyst of the abscess. In the second volume of the Edinburgh Medir cal and Surgical Journal, there is a well marked case of this disease described by Dr Drake.

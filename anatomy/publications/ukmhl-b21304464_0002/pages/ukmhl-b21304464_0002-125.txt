They see a Herniary Tumour in advanced age, lying in the oblique course of the Canal; but they forget to inquire when the protrusion took place, and w'ha,t was the original appearance of the Tumour. “ Were they to trace their cases to their ori- gin, they w^ould most probably ascertain, that, in the first instance, the Hernia had appeared in infancy ; that it had been less oblique at the he- ginning^ hut imperceptibbj became more and more so.

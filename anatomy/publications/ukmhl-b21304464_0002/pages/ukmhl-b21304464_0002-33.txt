OF THE TEETH. II surface of the tobth, not only on thfe flat patt of the tooth, but also on the sides of the base. By such an arrangement of the fibres of the enamel, it is not apt to scale off; and therefore is well caU culated to resist attrition. The enamel contains, according to the experi- ments of Mr Pepys, 78 parts af phosphate of limey and 6 carbonate of limey hi the loc. It is al- most entirely soluble in acids; and retains its 'white colour, though exposed to a considerable degree of heat. The enamel forms only a crust for the teeth in man, and carnivorous animals ; blit, in the ruminant animal, it dips into the body of the tooth, and, being much harder, than the os- seous part, it is not so quickly worn down ; and therefore the tooth is always kept sharp, and fit for use. The roots of the teeth are cot^red by a thin layet of yellow matter, which has been called horny substance. Every tooth has a smooth, internal cavity, of the same shape as the body of the tooth, which is filled by a substance called Pulp. There is a small aperture near the point of each root, which leads into the cavity of the tooth, through which the bloodvessels and nerves enter into the sub- stance of the tooth.

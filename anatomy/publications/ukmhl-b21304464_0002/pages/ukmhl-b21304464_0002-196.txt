This species of Tumour very readily falls to pieces, and mixes in part with water, forming a turbid mixture ; and it is somewhat hardened by being put into strong spirits. It adheres but slightly to the organ from which it grows, by a number of small processes, which insinuate them- selves into the Villous Coat which has attained an unnatural thickness; and when the Tumour has been detached, the Villous Coat of the dis- eased bowel assumes somewhat of a honeycomb appearance; and it is besmeared by several drops of blood, which are derived from the vessels which extended to the Tumour being torn. The bowel from which such a Tumour grows externally, betrays marks of inflammation. There is evidently an unnatural determination of blood to the seat of the disease; the bloodvessels upon the Peritoneal Coat being not only larger, but also more numerous than in the healthy state. The neighbouring Lymphatic Glands also par- take of the disease, being much larger than in the healthy state, and are filled by precisely the same milt-like matter. In a case which I have had oc- casion to examine, where the Bladder was filled by the milt-like matter, one of the Lymphatic Glands at the side of the Bladder, had atialned the size of the first; so that I at first supposed there had been an unnatural contraction in the

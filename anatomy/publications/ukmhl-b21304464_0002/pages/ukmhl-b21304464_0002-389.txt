OnCANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. S67 CHAPTER I. OF THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. Sect. I. The Heart, Arteries and Veins, from their structure, situation, and functions, are much ex- posed to Organic derangements. The most frequent organic derangement of the Vascular System, is Ossification. It occurs ge- nerally between the muscular and internal Coats, or on the inner surface of this last; and, in its incipient state, appears in the form of small points, or of thin bony shells. Such Ossifications more frequently occur in the Semilunar Valves, at the beginning of the Aorta, or on the Mitral Valve at the mouth of the Au- ricle, and are frequently attended with a dilata- tion of the diseased Artery, and with an enlarge- ment, not only in the capacity of the left Ventri- cle, but of the substance and thickness of its mus- cular fibres.

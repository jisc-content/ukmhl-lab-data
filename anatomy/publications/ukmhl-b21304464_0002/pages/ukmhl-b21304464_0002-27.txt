The food, owing to the particular figure, posi- tion, and structure of the orifices of the human stomach, is retained within that organ, to undergo the first process of digestion. > Some authors have asserted, that the food is completely digested within the stomach by means of the Gastric Juice. But in my opinion this as- sertion is not well founded, nor do I think the process of digestion can be considered as com- plete, until the aliment has been mixed with the bile, pancreatic juice, and other animal secretions, in its long circuitous route through the intestines, by which its nature is completely changed, or its assimilation perfected. The Chyle or nutritious part, the product of di- gestion, is afterwards in all probability somewhat changed in its properties during its passage through'* the lacteal vessels; but it is not completely ani^ malized until after its admixture with the blood, and until it has been exposed in its passage through the lungs to the influence of the atmospherical air.

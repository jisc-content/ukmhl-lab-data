When .the Villous Coat has been reduced to this condition, it assumes a pulpy appearance, is jmuch softer, thicker and redder than usual, and iery iirregular on its’surface.' The distinction between the sound and diseased joart is generally very manifest, the latter having at its edges a puckered appearance. , Fungous Tumours of different sizes, some near- ly as large as small .walnuts, sometimes pass across the bowel within which they are lodged. The Villous Coat has sometimes been reduced to a Fungous state, when albuminous matter ha.<» been deposited between the Coats of the Stomach .j and still more frequently in cases of Scirrhus, or Cancer of the Gullet, Stomach, or Intestinal Canal. \ * yid.

OUTLINES OP ANAT05lir. 43Z ncnt parts of the Larynx being lessened or de- stroyed, the voice becomes much feebler: And there have been instances, as I have been in- formed by my Father, of these morbid ossifica- tions exfoliating internally, and portions of the bony matter expelled by coughing. Of Ulceration of the Inner Membrane of the Larynx and Trachea, This membrane, as has been already observed, is very subject to inflammation, and sometimes to ulceration, especially in persons of a scrofulous habit, or in such as have been long affected with the Lues Venerea; these ulcerations are most commonly found in the Sacculi Laryngis. There is a preparation in the Edinburgh Mu- seum, of a portion of the Larynx and Trachea, In which the internal membrane was thickened and ulcerated. This was taken from the'body of a woman who died suddenly in a fit of coughing, after having gone through a mercurial course for a Lues Venerea. Ulcers likewise are formed in the Trachea, in consequence of the Cynanche Maligna; and are at times observed in consequence of abscess, or ul- ceration of neighbouring or contiguous parts. Thus 1 have known an abscess, which began in the Oesophagus, penetrate into the Trachea, and suffocate the patient.

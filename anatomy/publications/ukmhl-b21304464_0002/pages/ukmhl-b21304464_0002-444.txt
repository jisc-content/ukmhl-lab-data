422 OUTLINES OF ANATOMF, s Sect. Ill, OF THE THYROID GLAND. The Thyroid Gland is situated immediately beneath the Larynx, upon the Trachea, and cover- ed by the Sterno-Thyroid, Sterno-Hyoid, and Omohyoid Muscles. 1 his Gland varies in size In different individ- uals. It is composed of two distinct lobes, gene- rally united by a small transverse flat band, the thickness of which is very various. _ '' This Gland is covered by a condensed cellular, sheath, within which there is in some cases a ' muscle, called by Haller the Levator Glandulce Thyroidece, and by Soemmering, the Musculus Glandidoe 1 hyroidecc. I'he above muscle takes its rise from the base of the Os Hyoides; and its fibres are expanded upon the Thyroid Gland, and by its action may tend to elevate' this Gland. * This is a conglomerate gland, the larger Lobes of which consist of smaller Lobules. This Gland receives its Blood by four large) Arteries, which are derived from the external Carotid, and Subclavian Arteries ; the corres- ponding Veins, which are also of large size, ter- minate in the Jugular and Subclavian Veins.

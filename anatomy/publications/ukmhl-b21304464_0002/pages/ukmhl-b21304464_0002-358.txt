335 OUTLINES OF ANATOmV. and over the termination of that vein there is a small valve of a crescentic shape. There is an imperfect valve between the Vena Cava Inferior, and the Auricle, which is placed on the left side of the mouth of the Vena Cava Inferior, and which covers one half of the mouth of that vein. This membrane is generally perforated ; and its convex edge is fixed to the union of the Vena Cava and Auricle. * Around the passage of communication, between the Auricle and Ventricle, a membrane, or, as some have called it, tendon, is placed. There is a valve between the Auricle and Ven- tricle. 1 This valve consists of a circular fold of thin membrane, which is divided at its infetior part into several portions, three of which are more considerable than the others, and are connected by a number of threads of a determinate length, which are fixed to the Columnae Carneas of the Ventricle* When the blood regurgitates, the different parts of the valve are thrust upwards, and form a com- plete barrier to the reflux of the blood ; for this valve is so constructed, as to clap close to the side of the cavity when the stream of blood flows from the Auricle into the Ventricle; but it shuts up â€¢ This Valve is admirably represented by Scarpa, in Plate V. of his Views of the Nerves of the Neck and Thorax,

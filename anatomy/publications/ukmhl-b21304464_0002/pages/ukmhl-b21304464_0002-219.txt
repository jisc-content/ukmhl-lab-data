OF THE VARIETIES OF CRURAL HERNIA. 197 been accurately described by Mr A, Cooper. The Tumour has not a well defined edge, being covered by the Fascia Lata of the Thigh. In this Hernia, the strangulation may be occa- sioned by the border of the Sheath. The fourth is that variety of Crural Hernia where the Tumour passes through the Ilial side of the Lymphatic Sheath, into the Sheath of the Fe- moral Vein. The Flernial Tumour is originally situated on the Pubal side of the Femoral Vein, having the semi-lunar fold of the Fascia Lata stretched across its neck; and the Epigastric Artery is situated on the Ilial side of the swelling ; and its termination is placed in front of the Femoral Vein, distending the Sheath of that vessel. In the ffth variety of this disease, there are two Tumours ; the one escapes into the Sheath of the Vein, the other into that of the Lymphatic Vessels. Mr A. Burns discovered this variety ; and from his preparation the figure above alluded to is taken. In this instance, the Obturator Artery passed between the Hernias, and encircled the Tumour next the Os Ilium. Mr Burns, speaking of this variety of Crural Hernia, has remarked, â€œ When this happens in a person in whom the Obturator Artery comes off by the short origin from the Epigastric Artery, the former vessel will to a certainty encircle the

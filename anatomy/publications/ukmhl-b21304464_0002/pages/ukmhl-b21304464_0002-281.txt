259 or THE COATS OP HYDATIDS. ‘ Of the Coats of Hydatids. 'i || The Coats of Hydatids are not of an uniform ]j density, being much thicker in some, than in o- .1 thers j and even in the same Hydatid, we gene- I rally observe some portions of these Coats of I greater density than others; so that, in the same I' Hydatid, there is a difference, as to transparency j or opacity, in the different parts of its Coats. '1 Hydatids have two Coats, an outer and inner j I and the outer Coat is considerably thicker than I ' the inner. I There are no Fibres in the outer Coat of a Hy- datid, visible to the naked eye ; yet the outer Coat j possesses the distinguishing character of a Muscle, —the power of contraction upon the application ! of a stimulus. I *^The inner Coat of the Hydatid is very thin, se- mitransparent, soft, pulpy, and very tender ; and, in very large Hydatids, possesses a small share of ; elasticity. The interior surface is lubricated by a I fluid, which renders it slippery to the touch. From the inner side of some of the larger Hy- datids, there are several excrescences, which are made up of a congeries of very small Hydatids; and the size of these bears a ratio to the size of the Hydatid. These excrescences are retained in their situa- tion by a very thin transparent membrane, which covers them. R 2

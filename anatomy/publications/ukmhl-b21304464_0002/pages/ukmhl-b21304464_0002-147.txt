Of THt iNtESTItJAL CXHkJj. iHB Sulphurated and Phosphorated Hydrogen Gases are also found within the Stomach and Intestines of the dyspeptic, gouty, &c. It also seems probable, that a part of the air is swallowed along with the food, and a part secreted by the blood-vessels. Sect. VII. OF THE INTESTINAL CANAL. The Intestines, on account of their unequal diameter, have been divided into the Smaller and Greater Intestines. The Colon, the greatest portion of the larger Intestines, surrounds the smaller. The smaller Intestines extend from the Stomach to the Valve of the Colon. They are longer than the larger Intestines ; and have been divided by anatomists into three parts. Duodenum, Jejunum, and Ileum. The whole tract of the smaller Intestines is not of equal calibre : that portion next the Stomach is the largest, and that next the Colon is the smallest. Hence the smaller Intestines form a co- nical, not a cylindrical tube. The greater share of the smaller Intestines is very moveable, excepting the Duodenum, which is firmly fixed down by the Layers of the Meso- colon.

OF THE VAUIETIF.S OF CRURAL IIERXIA. 195 Crural Hernice are generally filled by a portion of Intestine, and frequently by a process of Intes- tine which is somewhat like the finger of a glove ; which has hence been called Diverticulum. The Spermatic Cord and round Ligament are rather more than half an inch distant from the mouth of the Sac of the Hernia, and oh the upper and Ilial side of it. Of the Varieties of Crural Ilemia* There are several varieties of this disease. ist, The most common land of Crural Hernia is that in which the bowels are protruded through the Crural Aperture into the Lymphatic Sheath, which is thereby much distended and protruded. In this instance, the Hernial Tumour is situat- ed on the Pubal side of the Femoral Vein, and is covered by the Fascia Propria, * which is ra- * The Fascia Propria has been tlius described by its dis- coverer, Mr Astley Cooper. “ A thin fascia naturally covers the opening, through which the Hernia passes, and descends on the posterior part of the Pubes. When the Hernia therefore enters the sheath, it pushes this fascia be- fore it, so that the Sac may be pei’fectly drawn from its, inner side, and the Fascia which covers it left distinct. The Fascia, which forms the Crural Sheath, and in which are placed the hole or holes for the absorbent vessels, is also protruded fpnvards, and is united with the other, so that, ihe two become thus consolidated into one.

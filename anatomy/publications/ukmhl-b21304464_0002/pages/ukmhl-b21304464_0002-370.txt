The Vasa Vasorum which are proper to the Coats of the Arteries and Veins, do not come directly from the trunk of the Artery itself, but from the neighbouring Arteries. There are many Lymphatic Vessels which are proper to the Coats of the Arteries, otherwise their cavity could not be extended in proportion to the bulk of the body. There are also Nerves which are proper to the Coats of the Bloodvessels. The Nerves have a great influence on the Ar- teries ; they preserve their irritability, and con- sequently promote the circulation of the blood in the extreme branches, and maintain the functions of secretion. â€¢ Every part of the body is not supplied with the same number of Arteries and Nerves. The different organs are more or less sensible ; which seems to depend upon the number and size of the Nerves proper, to these. The Brain, and organs of sense, are amply sup- plied with Arteries ; and in many instances from different sources. The Arterial and Nervous Systems have a great degree of sympathy with each other, and fit each other for their proper functions. The mind, in most eases, has no influence upon the state of the circulation of the Blood; but when the Nervous System has been excited, the Blood circulates more quickly than usual.

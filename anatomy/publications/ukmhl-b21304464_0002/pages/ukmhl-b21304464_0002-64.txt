OUTLIKES OF ANATOMY. Of the Sublingual Gland. The Sublingual gland is situated under the an- terior part of the tongue, above the duct of the inferior Maxillary gland, between the Mylo-hyoi- deus and Genio-glossus muscles. The upper part of the gland projects into the mouth. The ducts of this gland open into the duct of the Submaxillary gland, or a little to the outside of the Frjenum Linguae. A duct similar to the duct of the Submaxillary gland, sometimes o- pens in the side of the duct of the Submaxillary gland. The smaller Salivary glands are placed in the lips, cheeks, tongue, and palate; and are of va- rious sizes, in different individuals, Chemical Analysis of the Saliva. Saliva appears to be a solution, in a large quan- tity of water, of albumen, mucus, and certain sa- line substances, compounds of phosphoric and muriatic acids ; with soda, ammonia, and lime. The proportions are conjectured by Dr Bostock to be about eighty of water, and eight of coagu- lated albumen j eleven of mucus, and one of saline compounds. * * Vide Murrayâ€™s Chemistry, third edition, vol. 4th, p. 537.

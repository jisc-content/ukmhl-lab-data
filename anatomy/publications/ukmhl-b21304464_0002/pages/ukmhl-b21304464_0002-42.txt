OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 20 next the enamel being first formed, and the other layers being added within it. The roots are then added to the teeth, and are formed upon the pulp, which is elongated in con- sequence of the pressure made upon it by the progress of the ossification of the body of the tooth. When there are two or more roots, the osse- ous fibres extend across the under part of the bodies of the teeth, and leave vacant spaces, through which the processes of the pulp are pro- truded, and upon which the roots are formed. Of the Formation of the Enamel. The Enamel is secreted by the outer membrane of the capsule of the pulp, and is deposited. 'The Enamel, when first formed, is so soft, that it may be scraped by the nail. The Enamel is at first perfect on the cutting edges, or protuberances, of the tooth ; and it does not extend beyond the neck of the tooth. The Enamel continues to be secreted as long as the teeth are contained in their capsules. The mem- brane which secretes the Enamel is but of' tempo^ vary dw'ation : after having performed its office, it disappears. The teeth, by becoming larger within their sockets, stretch, and at length burst their capsules, which are removed by absorption. - The gum is also removed, and the tooth ap- pears through it: hence all that portion of mem- brane which loosely surrounded the body of the I

12 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. The bony * * * § matter of the teeth, which is hard- er than that of most other bones, consists of a number of layers, parallel to the pulp, and to each other j and, according to Mr Pepys, con- sists 1af 58 parts in the 100 of phosphate of lime, of 4 of carbonate of lime, of jelly 28 ; and the water of composition and loss, amounted to 10. § The teeth are amply furnished with Bloodvessels, which may be filled with a colouring liquor, and, if divided, pour out blood, as the teeth are sawn across by the dentist. As a further proof of the vascularity of the teeth. Nodes sometimes form on them ; and the roots are sometimes joined together by Anchy- losis. The teeth have also Lymphatic Vessels. 'I'hough the Lymphatic Vessels of the teeth can- not be demonstrated, there are various facts which prove their existence, viz. the absorption of the roots of the first set of teeth, the colour given to the osseous part of the teeth by madder, being re- moved after discontinuing the use of it, and the' swelling of the lymphatic glands from a carious tooth. * Eysson t and Cuvier f affirm, that the bony part of the tooth differs from common bone in its structure and manner of formation; and that it resembles common bone only in hard- ness, and in its constituent ingredients. •j- Vid.

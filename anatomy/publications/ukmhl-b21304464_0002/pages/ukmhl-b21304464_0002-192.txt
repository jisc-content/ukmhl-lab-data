OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 170 Of the Appearances of the true Dysentery. Inflammation of the great Intestines is often observed ; and there are black spots upon the Curvum, (commonly called Rectum), upon the Colon, and even on the smaller Intestines. * On an accurate examination, these black spots were found to be owing to black blood diffused through the Cellular Membranes, situated between the fine internal Villous and the Muscular Coats of the Intestines ; and in the middle of these black spots there was generally more or less of an ero- sion of the Villous Coat. Ulcers to a considerable extent take place from long continued Dysentery ; and sometimes a sub- stance, like a slough, is discharged by the Intes- tines, which takes the form of the Intestines ; it is merely coagulable Lymph, which has been effused in consequence of inflammation. On raising the Villous Coat which covered these black spots, it appeared fine and transparent, though the Cellular Membrane below was black j and on dissecting away this black cellular mem- brane, the muscular fibres of the Gut appeared of their natural colour. Sometimes I have observed ulcers of a consi- derable size in the Villous Coat of the Rectum. * Tlie following account of the appearances on dissection in Dysentery, is taken Irom a manuscript of my late uncle.

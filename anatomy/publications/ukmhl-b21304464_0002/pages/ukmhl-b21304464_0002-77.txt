OF THE MUSCLES OF THE CHEEKS AND LIPS. 55 The Labialis, or Orbicularis Oris. The fibres of this muscle, which are small, de- cussate each other at the corners of the mouth; so that this muscle seems to consist of two semi- circular muscles. The outer part of the muscle is formed of the fibres of all the Levatores Labii Superioris and Zygomatici. The internal fibres form the true Sphyncter Oris. This muscle shuts the mouth : it brings the lips into contact with each other, or with any substance put into the mouth, as in the act of suction. A part of this muscle forms the Nasalis Labii Superioris of Albinus. Zygomato-labiales Major and Minor, or the Zjjgomaticus Major and Minor, Arise from the convexity of the Os Malae, and descend obliquely forwards, and terminate in the corner of the mouth, where their fibres are in- corporated with those of the Depressor Anguli Oris. When the muscles of opposite sides act at the same time, they draw the corners of the mouth outwards, as in laughing.

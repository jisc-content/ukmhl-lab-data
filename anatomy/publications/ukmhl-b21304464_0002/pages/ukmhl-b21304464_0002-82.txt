OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 60 This muscle arises from the insertion of the circumflexus palati, and the root of the Uvula. This muscle is fixed into the middle constric- tors of the pharynx, and into the upper and back part of the thyroid cartilage. By these muscular fibres, the Velum and Uvula are drawn downwards, by which the passage into the nostrils is shut during deglutition ; and they also assist in propelling the food into the fauces. Sect. V. DISPOSITION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FORE I’ART OF THE NECK. First Layer* Upon removing the skin and cellular sub- stance of the fore part of the neck, a thin tendi- nous membrane presents itself, under which there is a thin and broad muscle, which covers the greater part of the fore part of the neck j a part of the side of the face ; and a portion of the up- per part of the chest ; and which has been named riatysma Myoidcs, ‘ Second Layer. Under the Platysma Myoides, a strong muscle, extending obliquely upwards from the breast bone, and collar bone, to be fixed into the mastoid pro- cess of the temporal bone, Is seen, called Sterno- Cleldo-Mastoid Muscle.

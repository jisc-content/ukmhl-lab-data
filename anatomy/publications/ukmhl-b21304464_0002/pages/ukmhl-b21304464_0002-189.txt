I made several experiments upon dogs ; and found, that six, or even eight, grains of the metallic arsenic might be given to a dog with impunity. The Arsenic acted as a very pffwerful cathartic and diuretic. The black oxide of Arsenic produced, by ex- posing the metallic Arsenic, when minutely divid- ed, to the air and moisture, a very deadly poi- son ; for a single grain of this excites violent vo- miting of bile and blood, followed by death. The white oxyde of arsenic is equally deadly j and upon dissection, the Stomach is found vio- lently inflamed, eroded, or rather as if perforated by a sharp instrument; which perforations are surrounded by a red line, and in some places gangrenous. i,/ I found also, that an artificial Sulphuret, com- posed of equal parts of sulphur and arsenic, might be given, to the extent of ten or twelve grains, to . a dog with impunity ; but that a larger quantity occasioned the most violent symptoms.

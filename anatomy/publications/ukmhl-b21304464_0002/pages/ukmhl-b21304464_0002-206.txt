Upon dissection, we observe a thickening of all the Coats, especially of the Muscular Coats,' at the seat of the Stricture ; ah effusion of coagu- lable lyniph between them; and the bloodvessels at the seat of the Stricture, which were much enlarged, and distended by blood, forni a net- work upon it; and there is also a quantity of turbid serum effused into the cavity of the Abdomen, when the disease is seated in the Intestines^ The second, or Scirrhous Stricture, is of slow growth; appears only in persons who are far ad- vanced in life, of a sallow complexion, and who are disposed to cancer; or in those whose consti- tutions have been much impaired : and upon dis- section, we meet with a constriction, of an inch in length, of a cartilaginous consistence, and In which there is no appearance of the Coats of the Ali-*. mentary Canal; all'of these having been absorb- ed, and cartilaginous matter been deposited in their stead.

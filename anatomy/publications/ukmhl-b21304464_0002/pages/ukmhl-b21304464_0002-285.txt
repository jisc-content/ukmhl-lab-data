DIFFERENT STATES IN WHICH HYDATIDS ARE FOUND. 260 excrescences, which are attached to the large pregnant Hydatids. After a time, these small Hydatids are detached from the parent Hydatid. Hydatids are subject to diseases. Hydatids sometimes burst within their Sacs. We sometimes meet with Tumours, which are made up entirely of pieces of Coagulable Lymph and Hydatids, the water having been removed by absorption. Hence the Tumour does not com- municate a sense of fluctuation, as when the Hy- datids were entire. . The external Coat of Hydatids has sometimes been converted into Bone. I have several preparations, which afford a strik- ing illustration of the manner in which Bone is formed upon the Coats and Sac of Hydatids. The Ossification begins from a few central points npon the Coats of the Hydatid and by subse- quent depositions, the pieces of Bone gradually become larger and larger, so that at length a con- siderable mass of Bone is formed. Of the manner in 'which the Cysts of Hydatids are formed. The Sac containing the Hydatid seems to be formed in consequence of the irritation of the Hydatid. In the same manner, where a large quantity of purulent matter has been contained within the

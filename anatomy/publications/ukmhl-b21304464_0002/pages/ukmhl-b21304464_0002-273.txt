251 TUMOURS OF THE LIVER. I The Gall-Bladder sometimes attains so large a bulk, as to project considerably beyond the mar- gin of the Ghest, and its Coats become thicker and redder than usual; but, in most cases, it con- tains but little bile, and is smaller than common; and its Coats are of a vi'hite colour, and much in- durated. The Bile within the Gall-Bladder is generally, in such cases, found to be thin and wa- tery, and not so bitter as usual. The most common kind of Tumour of the Liv- er, is that w’hich has been very faithfully describ- ed by Dr Baillie in the following manner. “ The Tubercles which are formed in this dis* ease occupy generally the whole mass of the Liv- er, are placed very near each other, and are of a rounded shape. They give an appearance every where of irregularity to its surface. When cut into, they arc found to consist of a brownish or yellowish white solid matter. They are some, times of a very small size, so as not to be larger than the heads of large pins ; but most frequently they are as large as small hazel nuts, and many of them are sometimes larger. ” * When such tumours occur in the Liver, that organ loses its natural form. It becomes much thicker, especially at its edges; and also becomes heavier, though smaller in bulk, than the sound Liver, the Tumours being composed of very dense materials. We meet with yellow-coloured Tumours both upon the surface, and within the substance of the i* . ' • ■ ■ ' * Fid. Morbid Anatomy.

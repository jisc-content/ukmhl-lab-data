OF THE TEETH. 19 is attached, by means of its nerves and bloodves- sels, to the bottom of the alveolar processes; and its upper part is attached to the inner side of the gums. The pulp becomes gradually firmer and larger, so that at length it acquires the shape and size of the tooth about to be formed upon it. The Ossification begins about the sixth month after conception, upon the pulps, in the form of spots; the situation of which corresponds with the points of the teeth. The number of these Ossification's corresponds with the eminences on the pulp ; these gradually increase, and form a thin shell of bone, which covers the surface of the tooth. In the Incisor teeth, there are generally three points of ossifica- tion ; in the Canine only one point ; and in the Molares four or five points of ossification ; and these increase, in some, until their bases are united. The Ossification in the bases takes place in a lamellaled manner, and from 'without inwards; and the bony shells which form the teeth are a little contracted at the collar of the toothi At the period of birth, the outer shells of five teeth are found on each side of each jaw, or of twenty teeth. The bodies of the teeth are first converted into bone ; and the ossification goes on by a succes- sive deposition from without inwards; the layer B3

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 76 Poupart^s Ligament, or the Crural Arch, iV sometimes double, I have seen two such liga- ments on each side. When that is the case, the one ligament is generally fixed about a line above the tubercle of the Pubes, and the other is found in its usual situation. About an inch, or a little more, from the Sym- physis Pubis, the tendon of the External Oblique muscle is generally divided into an upper and un- der column; but in some instances, the division takes place at a greater distance from the Sym- physis Pubis. Between the tendinous columns, which are connected at the upper part by a few transverse tendinous fibres, a space intervenes, which is somewhat of an oval figure, which has been commonly called the Spermatic Ring; but this term conveys an inaccurate idea of the form of this aperture, and it should be called Inguinal, or Abdominal Aperture, and with the addi- tion of the word Under, to distinguish it from the Upper Inguinal or Abdominal Aper- ture. Through the Under Abdominal Aperture, the Spermatic Cord passes ; and in the female, the round ligament of the Uterus : and there is no direct opening into the Abdomen, the passage being shut up by|the Internal Oblique, and Trans- verse muscles, and by the Fascia Transversalis. The Under Abdominal Aperture in the male is somewhat curved above, angular below.

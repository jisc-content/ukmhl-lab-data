OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 98 as a part of Camper’s Fascia, attached to the Ring. I thought that this structure had not been noticed by any author. I find, however, that it has not escaped that indefatigable anatomist Cam- per, who delineates it very accurately in his plate. It is easiest detected by slitting up Cam- per’s Fascia, by which I mean the sheath of the Cremaster, till we come near to the Ring. When we have done this, if we then insinuate the point of the finger into the lower orifice of the Canal in the adult, or Ring in the child, we find that we arc by this fillet prevented from carrying the finger toward the Pubes. “ This part of the Canal merits peculiar atten- tion ; for whoever is ignorant of the position and connexion of this production from the upper pil- lar of the Ring, can possess only a very confused notion of its action in disease. “ When I shall have stated the anatomy of the Groin in the young subject, and have pointed out the changes which take place on these as life ad- vances,' I shall then have occasion to notice the effect of this fillet in preventing the formation of Hernia ; and also, we shall see that when a pro- trusion has actually taken place, it has a consi- derable share in preventing reduction. “ When we have examined in the very young subject, the structure of the external orifice, through which the cord passes, we have seen all that is most worthy of notice, for in the very early part of life, the Inguinal Canal is not form-

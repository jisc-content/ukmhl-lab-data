OF.THE ARTERIES AND VEINS OF THE INTESTINES. 141 The extremity of the Intestinum Curvum is much less irritable than the other parts of the In- testinal Canal, and is enlarged somewhat above the Sphincter Ani. This is very conducive to our convenience. By these means, the faeces are re- tained and accumulated for a time within the Rec- tum ; by which we are enabled to chuse a fit time and place for discharging the contents. But in cases where there is a great accumulation of faeces, if the individual does not obey the warning, the muscles act involuntarily, and expel the fasces. The Muscular Fibres of the Intestinum Cur- vum are thicker and stronger than those of any other part of the intestines. There are a number of Mucous Follicles at the verge of the Anus, which secrete a good deal of Mucus, in order to prevent excoriation. The Anus is also enveloped in a quantity of Fat, which admits of the expansion of the Intestinum- Curvum. Arteries and Veins of the Intestinal Canal. The Intestinal Canal is largely supplied with blood. The Duodenum receives blood from the He- patic and Splenic Arteries ; and the other parts of the Intestinal Canal are supplied by the Superior and Inferior Mesenteric Arteries.

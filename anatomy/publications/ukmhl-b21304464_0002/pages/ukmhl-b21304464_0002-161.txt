or THE AFPENDIX VERMIFORMIS. isa Muscular Coats form large transverse folds, which are larger at the beginning of the Intestine, be- come gradually smaller, and are at length lost in the Curvum ; and between these folds large Cells are formed. Mucous Glands of the Intestines. The Mucous Glands of the Intestines are more or less obvious, being of different sizes. They are numerous in the smaller Intestines, and are collected into groups, or solitafy. Appendix Vermiformis. The Appendix Vermiformis is fixed down to the posterior part of the Caput Caecum Coli by the Peritonaeum, which forms its Mesentery. This Appendix, into which the faeces do not pass, is cylindrical in shape, tortuous in its course, about four or five inches long, and ends in a blind Sac. There are many mucous glands between its Coats, which secrete a mucous fluid, which pro- bably passes into the Caecum.

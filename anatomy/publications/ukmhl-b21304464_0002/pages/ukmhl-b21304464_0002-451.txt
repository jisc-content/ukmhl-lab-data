OF THB onCANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE LARYNX. 4:29 pearance of a preternatural membrane ; which, when the Trachea is opened, is of a light green colour; and by exposure to air, changes to a dirty yellow, and becomes white when put into spirits. The surface of this membrane has a shining appearance, and is covered by a quantity of mucus. This membrane is of various degrees of thick- ness, of different consistence, and of greater or less extent in different instances. I have remarked also, that it is more or less thick in different parts of the Larynx and Tra- chea ; the superior, or upper part, is generally the thickest within the Larynx; and has often .t rough and corrugated surface j whilst the surface of other parts of the membrane is quite smooth. This inflammatory exudation, being on some occasions very tenacious, may be extracted in the form of a tube, retaining the impression of the in- ner membrane and cartilages of the Trachea. Sometimes it is as thin as paper, and breaks, into pieces when slightly touched; sometimes, instead of a membrane, the inner surfaces of the Larynx and Trachea are covered by purulent matter. The preternatural membrane is sometimes soft, pulpy, and perforated by a number of small holes, which probably are formed by the flow of mucus from the mucous ducts. The diseased membrane is most generally found

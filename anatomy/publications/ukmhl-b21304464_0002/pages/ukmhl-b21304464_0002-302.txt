OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 280 The Scirrhous Pancreas cannot generally be perceived by an examination by the hand, except where it is very much enlarged, and in persons who are much emaciated. Calculi in the Pancreas, Are by no means so frequent as in the biliary or urinary canals. Dr Baillie says he had seen only one instance of this disease *, and Dr Cam- per showed one to my Father. * These Calculi seem to be similar to the Calculi found in the ducts of the other salivary glands, being always of a white colour. Portal f relates the history of a case, in which he found a dozen of such concretions, of various sizes, some of which were as large as a haiel nut; and the Pancreatic Duct was so much en- larged, as readily to receive a very large quill. Upon reducing some of these Calculi into pow- der, and throwing them into boiling water, he has observed that they were soluble in that fluid, and had an insipid taste. In that instance, the Pancreas was much enlarged, and compressed the Aorta, which was in an aneurismal state, against the Spine. * yid. Morbid Anat. p. 226. 2d edit, Vid, Anat. Mcdicale, Tom. V.

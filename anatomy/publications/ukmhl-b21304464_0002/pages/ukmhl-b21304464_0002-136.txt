OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 114 by my own observations, but also by the concur- ring testimony of the most eminent anatomists of all ages. There is also a mistake in the assertion which forms the concluding part of the same sentence. That this stricture was unnoticed by any former anatomist. In proof of this I have only to refer the reader to the references at the bottom of p. 111. The second position laid down by Mr Home, That the stricture of the Stomach is not univer- sally, but “ very generally” to be met with, is also • objectionable. His last position is, that this stricture is only “ occasionally” to be met with ; to which I readily subscribe ; but what is occasional cannot be said to be constant. That this stricture, or occasional appearance of the Stomach, described by various anatomists, and which has occurred to myself, is generally the re- sult of Spasm affecting particular muscular fibres of the Stomach, and which takes place during life, and appears even after death, and is a mor- bid not a natural appearance, seems to me proved by the following circumstances : 1st, As there is no peculiar organization of the Stomach, or band of muscular fibres, to cause such a division ; and as the stricture, according to Mr Home, varies in situation, degree of con- traction, and extent, in different subjects, which could not be the case were it a natural formation of the Stomach itself.

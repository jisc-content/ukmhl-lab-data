OP THE CIRCULATION OF 'rtlE BLOOD. 333 the Heart is very peculiar ; and by their contrac- tion, the included blood is expelled. The Heart (as Harvey calls it), ihtfundamen- twm vitce^ princeps omnium^ is in the alternate state of contraction (or systole), and dilatation (or dias- tole), from the moment of our existence till the moment of death. 6. During the contraction of the Heart, it starts forwards, describes a portion of a circle, and strikes the side; which is to be imputed to the .filling of the auricles placed at the base of the Heart, and to the sudden dilatation of the arch of the aorta ; the anterior part of which is move- able, but the posterior part is fixed down. Daring this contraction, the apex approaches its base ; the sides of the ventricles are drawn towards the Septum Cordis, which is more fixed ; and, from the corresponding cavities being filled at the same time, and being united by a common Septum, they must act at the same time. The Auricles and Ventricles are successively contracted and dilated. When, by the contraction of the Auricles, the blood which they have received by the Venae Cavae and Pulmonary Veins is expelled, the Ventricles are relaxed, and ready to receive the blood ; and when the Ventricles contract, and expel their con- tents into the Pulmonary Artery and Aorta, the Auricles are relaxed.

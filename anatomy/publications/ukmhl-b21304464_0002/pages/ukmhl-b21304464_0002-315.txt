OF THE CAUSES OF ABSORPTION. 29S tubes 5 but at other times, it contracts them. It can elongate the Lymphatic Vessels, and thus in- crease or lessen the diameter of the Absorbing Vessel. Our absorbents probably also vary their calibre, â€¢ according to the matter to be absorbed. It is probable that different parts of the same Lymphatic possess very different degrees of irri- tability. These vessels are probably more Irritable at their mouths than elsewhere ; which irritability is propagated along the Lymphatic Vessel by the stimulus of the Chyle. This -is by no means a solitary case ; for par- ticular parts of membranes are endowed with very different degrees of irritability : thus the Pharynx, Glottis, and Larynx, are lined by the same membrane ; but that part of the membrane which lines the Larynx, is much more exquisitely sensible than that of the Pharynx j for if a drop of water, or even of warm saliva, gets into the Glottis, even distant muscles are thrown into con- vulsions, and a fit of coughing is excited. Farther, at different periods of life the absorb- ent Vessels possess different degrees of irritabi- lity. Absorption goes on more quickly during very early life than in old age ; and it has even been affirmed by some authors, that the Lymphatic Vessels of young persons continue to perform ab- sorption for a short time after death.

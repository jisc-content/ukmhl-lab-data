V 34<3 OF THj: VEINS. The course of the Veins is not similar to that of the Arteries. There are many ot the larger trunks of the Veins which lye under the skin ; whereas the larger branches of the Arteries arc deep seated. The branches of the Veins communicate with each other more freely and more frequently than the branches of the Arteries ; they communicate by a straight canal, or by arches; or the commu-i liications are so numerous as to form a plexus. * The communications between the branches of the Veins are most numerous, because the course of the blood in these is more apt to be interrupted by violent motion, by the efl'ect of gravitation dur- ing our erect posture, or by external and internal pressure. The Veins are provided with Valves, by which the blood flows readily in one direction only. The Valves are formed by a reflexion of the innermost coat of the Vein ; are of the figure of a parabola ; are concave towards the Heart; and are generally disposed in pairs : and these Valve^ are perfectly similar to each other. These Valves are more numerous in some than in other Veins. A Single Valves are sometimes found in the Veins of the Hands and Feet. Valves are found in those Veins particularly which are placed perpendicularly ; as in those of the Limbs ; and where the pressure occasioned by the contraction of the superincumbent muscles might have rendered the blood refluent.

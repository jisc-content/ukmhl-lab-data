OF THE HEART. 335 The human Heart is double ; the anterior part being destined to propel the blood into the Lungs, the posterior through the rest of the body. Hence the terms Pulmonic^ and Systematic Hearts^ have not inaptly been applied to describe the different hearts, or different sides of the same heart. The greater share of the internal surface of each of the cavities of the Heart is unequal, which arises from certain muscles being placed within them, called Columnce Cameo;. The cavities of the Heart are lined by a very thin, but dense, membrane, which prevents the blood from insinuating itself between the muscular fasciculi of the Heart. On each side of the Heart there Is an Auricle and a Ventricle ; and the. corresponding cavities in the opposite side of the Heart are different as to capacity,—as to the thickness of their Pa- rietes, and the colour of their contentsthe blood in the Anterior Heart being of a deep pur- ple colour, and that of the Posterior Heart of a brilliant red colour- fibres ; and thence turned toward the inside of the Heart, they are partly reflected in oblique spires, and as it were fillets, running transverse, toward the basis of the Heart, and partly seem to compose tha internal columns, to which the little chords of the three-j>ointcd and tlie mitral valves are fastened; while other some of them, being transversely woven together, fornulie Sinus of the right Ventricle."

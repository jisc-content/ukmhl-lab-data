OF THE A'SCARIS LUMBRtCbtlfES. 211 Sorfie have' stipposed thisf Wdtrit to be Herrriai- phrodit-ej' but the sexe^ generally appear dis- tinct. ^ ■ • I have remarked,^ that the females are larger, and more ntumerous than the males y- arid are ge- nerally in the proportion of four or fivd to one. The parts of generation begin, or rather ter- minate, near the middle of the Worm, by a slender tube, which opens about the middle of the animal. This tube soon becomes larger. It is then call- ed Uterus'. It divides^ into*two Canals, which are considerably larger than the Uterus; then sud- denly diminishes in size; and at last terminates in a number of small opaque threads, which float in the lowest part of the belly, and embrace the Intestines. These smallest floating tubes'are never empty, but are filled with an opaque fluid, in which there are a number of globular bodies floating. In the male, the small’ tubes lead to a' larger tortuous GanaU which may be called Vesicula Seminalis, which is rather more than an inch long, is unequal in its'diameter, and follows some- what of a tortuous course; and to the extremity of this,ia coniCal'shaped body, w'hich may be call- ed'Penis, is connected*by its base. Some authors have supposed that these Worms are viviparous j which appearance is produced by O 2

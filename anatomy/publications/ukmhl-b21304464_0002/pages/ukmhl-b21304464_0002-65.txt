43 -OF THE PIIARYMX. ^ Sect. VIIL OF THE PHARYNX. The Pharynx is a musculo*membraneous bag, of a conical figure, and fituated behind the tongue and posterior nostrils, upon the bodies of the cervical vertebrae, to which It is loosely connect- ed by a cellular substance. It is connected to the occipital and sphenoid bones above; to the gullet below ; and the larynx is placed before it; and, laterally, it is bounded by the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid bone, the cornua of the os hyoides, and by the carotid arteries and jugular veins. The Pharynx, through which the air passes into the lungs, and the food into the gullet, com- municates with the following parts, which may be readily seen by opening it from behind. By such a view are seen the oval shaped cavi- ties which lead into the nose ; the trumpet shaped opening of the Eustachian tube, which is encircled by cartilage, and therefore always kept open, placed at the communication between the nose and pharynx; the soft palate, with the isthmus fauciuM under it. The Epiglottis, covering the projecting larynx, isâ€œconnected with the root of the tongue at the fore part of the phar\mx. I

ON THE INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES. 391 of the lower end of the portion is at a greater distance from either end of the lower Rib, or from a straight line drawn between the two ends of that Rib, than its origin in the Rib above is from the two ends of that Rib, or from a straight line drawn between them. Hence, whether we consi- der the head of the Rib, connected with the Ver- tebrne, as its centre of motion,jor w'hether we con- sider the Rib as moving upon a straight line or axis drawn between its two ends, it follows, that a muscle placed between two Ribs acts with a .longer lever upon the under Rib than upon the upper one, and therefore must elevate the under Rib. V ‘ 4. To determine the effect of the contraction of any muscle, I apprehend, we need only to ob- serve in the dead body what the situation is in which the muscle in question is relaxed. Apply- ing this rule, we shall find, that the whole Inter- costal Muscles, internal as well as external, are shortened when we elevate the Ribs, and place them in that situation in which we find they are in inspiration. ‘ 5. If the Internal Intercostal Muscles had been intended for the depression of the Ribs, w’e certainly should not have found them continued to the Sternum, because their anterior ends are fixed above to the edge of the Sternum, or so near to the insertion of the Cartilage of the upper Rib in the Sternum ; and their inferior ends are, in consequence of their obliquity, fixed to the under

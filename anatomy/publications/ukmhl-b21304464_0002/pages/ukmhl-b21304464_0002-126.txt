OUTLINES or ANATOMY. lot seen, that, owing to changes which this open- • ing undergoes, the Gut comes to be lodged in a fully formed Canal. This continues till the Tumour becomes large, when the posterior side of the Canal is, owing to the pressure, slowly absorbed ; and again the upper and lower orifices are brought opposite to each other,. Again, the Hernia resembles, in its appearance and course, the Incipient 1 umbur. “ If the view which I have given of t^e mode of formation of the Inguinal Canal be corred, it will lead to this conclusion, that we ought, in e- very case of Hernia in a young child, most sedu- lously to prevent the descent of the Gut, and, if possible, to return also the Sac, where it is not Congenital Rupture ; for if we do this, we bid fair to cure the disease, by allowing of the exten- sion of' the posterior side of the Canal along the Coi'd. This observation leads me to a review of the influence which the different parts of the In- guinal Canal have in preventing the accession of Hernia. In the very young child, there is no securi- ty against Hernia, except what arises from the Cord filling the aperture through which it passes. This is generally sufficient; for the infant is ex- posed to few of the exciting causes of the disease. When, however, the child advances in years, in the course of its amusements, and afterward of its business, it is more and more exposed tp the causes of Hernia.

51 OF THE MUSCLES OF THE LOWER JAW, bail towards the nose, and which therefore has been called Adductor Oculi; and the insertion of the muscle which raises the eyeball, and which has therefore been called Levator Oculi, and the Obliquus Inferior OcuU<, is also imperfectly seen. On the side of the Coronoid process of the under jaw, next the mouth, a part of the Ptery~ goidcus supei'ior muscle comes into view. I shall describe, in Classes,' more particularly^ all the above muscles. Section II. .1 . j * . MUSCLES WHICH MOVE THE LOWER JAW. The under jaw is elevated and moved laterally by the Temporo-Maxillaris inferior, the Jugo- Maxillaris, and the Pterygoid muscles. The power of these muscles is very great, even in the human body, of which' many striking ex- amples are to be found in the Works of Vesa- Lius and Haller. In carnivorous animals, these muscles are of a much greater thickness and strength. € • • , _ Temporo-Maxillaris Inferior, or Temporal Muscle. This muscle takes Its origin from its Aponeu- rosis, and from the Temporal Fossa, formed by the Os Frontis, Temporis, Sphenoides, Malse, by ra- D ?.

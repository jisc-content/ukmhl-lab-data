5t OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. J cess of the Temporal bone, and, descending ob- liquely downwards and inwards through the fibres of the Stylo-hyoid muscle, it is connected to the Os Hydides by a thin ligament. It then passes obliquely upwards and outwards at an obtuse angle, and is fixed into the middle of the lower jaw at its lower part. By this muscle, the mouth is opened j and when the jaws are shut, the Os Hyoides is drawn towards the under jaw ; and the posterior part of the muscle draws the' Os Hyoides towards the Mastoid process of the Temporal bone. Dr Soemmering has stated, that if the lower jaw be fixed, this muscle tends to depress the back of the head upon the spine, and thereby to opeii the mouth, by elevating the upper jaw ; this he states he has observed while a child is sucking. There are some of the muscles which are fixed to the Os Hyoides, and under jaw, and also to the thorax, as the Platysma Myoides : But as these muscles are subservient to other purposes, they shall be mentioned in another place. ‘ t..t i i.*. • Section III.

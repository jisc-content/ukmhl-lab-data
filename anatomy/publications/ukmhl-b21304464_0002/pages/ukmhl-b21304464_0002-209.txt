or TVTVfHiVticErrtn, IÂ«7 upon the greater or ht$ irritation to which the leased part is exposed. In many cases of Scirrhns, the adhesive pre- cedes the ulcerative process. Thus, life is main- tained, though the Coats of the bowel, which has been primarily diseased, be destroyed by ulcera- tion. ITius, for example, the Stomach adheres to the Liver before, and to the Pancreas behind. If the Scirrhos be so situated as to interrupt the passage through the AHmentary Canal, as at the Cardia or Pylorus, the part above the Stricture becomes prodigiously enlarged, and its Coats are at first much thickened ; but, after a time, they become thinner, and even ulcerated, and at length ruptured, by which an unnatural communication is established between the seat of the disease and the neighbouring parts. Of Intus-Susceptiot A portion of Intestine sometimes passes within another, carrying along with it its Mesentery. The Intestine is then in a state of Intus-Susceptio; and this proves a cause of considerable stricture, the included Intestine being in a contracted state. It has been stated, that the internal Coat of the. Intestine is sometimes invaginated, and forms a complete barrier to the passage of the Alimentary Canal; but this I never have observed. 1 he Intestine passes generally into that imme- diately beneath it, and sometimes in the reverse manner.

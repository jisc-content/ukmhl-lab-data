185 DISEASES OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. ;ibove the Stricture is much enlarged ; whereas, that beneath it is much contracted ; and by tracing either of the dilated or contracted portions, we soon discover a part of the Canal which seems much contracted, as by a cord having been put around it, and which had left a purple mark ; and upon pressing this part, it feels heavy and hard. Strictures generally take place at that part of the Canal which is naturally most contracted. The part above the Stricture is much extended, often inflamed, ulcerated, and sometimes eroded. Coats of the Alimentary Canal reduced to a Pulpy â–  State, This peculiar and rare organic derangement of the Coats of the Alimentary Canal, has not, as far as I know, been described by any writer on Pathology. The affected part is much enlarged ; and its Coats, which are much thickened, do not possess their usual firmness; but feel very soft and pulpy, though not of a black colour ; are not dilatable, and emit a very peculiar sweetish smell. There is a quantity of dark-coloured and very offensive bile contained within the Intestines. The Mesen- teric Glands are generally enlarged, and some- times ulcerated.

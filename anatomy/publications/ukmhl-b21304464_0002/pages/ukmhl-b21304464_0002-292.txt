The bloodvessels of the Liver bear but a small proportion to the substance of the organ, and ap- pear to be smaller than usual. The Intestines are commonly filled by a white fseculent matter, such as is found within the bowels of those who die from Jaundice. The glands connected with the Lymphatic Sys- tem are generally much enlarged, and indurated ; and sometimes we meet with a swelling of the' Mesenteric Glands, or Tubercles in the Lungs. In the other variety of disease, in which the Liver attains an unnatural softness, it does not become so large as in the former, and assumes a pink colour ; and, when cut into, seems to be composed of a number of bodies of an oval figure, somewhat of the size of barleycorns, and which are rather of a paler colour than the rest of the I.iver. In this variety of diseased Liver, we sometimes meet with Hydatids within the substahee of the Liver. To the touch, the Liver feels very much like a portion of Lungs ; and, like these, is very rea- dily torn. The bloodvessels do not acquire a preeternatural size. The Lymphatic Glands of the capsule of Glys- soN are generally enlarged and indurated.

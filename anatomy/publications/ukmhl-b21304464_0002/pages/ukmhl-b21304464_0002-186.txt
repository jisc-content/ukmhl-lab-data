OUTLINES OF ANAtoMY* 164- I. Albumen, which was separated in white flakes by boiling the water. 2. A brown substance, which I consider as peculiar. It dissolved at first in water ; but became nearly insoluble, by the slow evaporation of the liquid. It dissolved in alcohol. It approached most nearly, in its pro- perties, to vegetable extractive; but the quantity which I obtained was too small for an exact examination. 3. Common salt, which cry- stallized when the water was allowed to evapo- rate spontaneously in an open vessel. 4. Phos- phate of lime, which was precipitated by ammo- nia. 5. Sulphate of soda, in a very minute pro- portion. 6. Perhaps also sulphate of lime ; but the quantity of this salt must have been very small. “ 3. Alcohol dissolved the peculiar brown matter, and some of the salts, but extracted no- thing particular. “ 4. Potash ley separated the albumen, the brown matter, and perhaps some of the salts^ “ 5. Muriatic acid separated a notable propor- tion of phosphate of lime. “ 6. After the action of all these reagents, there remained behind a peculiar substance, hav- ing the colour and texture of the calculus. Ten grains of calculus left 1.2 grains of this matter. It was very light, and had the appearance of cork, or rather of the peculiar fungus which is used on the Continent for tinder, and which the French call Amador. It was in very short threads. This

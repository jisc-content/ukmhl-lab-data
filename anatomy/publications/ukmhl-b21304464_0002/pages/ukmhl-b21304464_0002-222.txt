OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 200 Glands. A-central fluidity or elasticity III the Tumour, derived from the contents of the displacr ed portion of Intestine, is the chief circumstance which characterizes this variety of Crural Hernia. The eighth variety of Crural Hernia cannot be distinguished by an external examination. In this, the Obturator Artery arises from the same trunk as the Epigastric Artery. The common trunk being an inch long, the Obturator Artery, in its course to the Obturator Aperture, sweeps around the neck of the Hernial Tumour on its .Vubal side. I have met with three cases of this I • • • description. On account of the small size of the Crural Ring, and unyielding nature of the surrounding parts, a considerable pressure is made on the pro- truded bow'd ; and it is niore difficult to return the displaced parts than in Inguinal Hernia. The pressure very often causes acute inflammation ; and hence the contents of the Tumour are fre- quently covered by coagulable lymph, which binds the contents of the Tumour to each other, or to the neck, or some other part of the Sac. Umhilical Hernia. In this Hernia, the Bow^els are protruded through the Umbilical Ring, or at the side of the contents of the Abdomen.

These fibres do not resemble tendinous fibres, be- ing neither to the eye glistening, nor communicat- ing to the touch the same dense feeling as tendon. This membrane is proportionally thicker in the foetus. This fascia, which has always appeared to me to consist chiefly of condensed Cellular substance, covers the Spermatic Cord and round ligament of the Uterus, and also some of the Inguinal glands of the upper and under cluster ; a'nd may, in some subjects, at the upper part of the thigh, be divided into layers, between which some small Lymphatic glands are placed. In a few cases, it may be readily traced for six or eight inches down the thigh.

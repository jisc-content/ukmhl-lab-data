The Larger and Smaller Diaphragm are powerful muscles in respiration, and several other actions. During inspiration, the capacity of the Tho- rax is increased in three dilferent directions. By the descent ot the lateral muscular portions of the Diaphragm, and by the ascent of the Ribs, which are placed obliquely in respect to the Spine, the Thorax is rendered longer; and, by the Ribs be- ing thrust outw-ards, during their ascent, the transverse diameter of the Chest is increased; and, in consequence of the Breastbone being thrust forwards during the elevation of the Ijlibs, the Thorax is rendered deeper, and the distance between the Breastbone and Vertebras becomes greater. Respiration may be performed chiefly or solely by the Intercostal Muscles, or Diaphragm. The Intercostal Muscles are chiefly employed when the descent of the Diaphragm is impeded by the un- usual bulk of the bowels of the Belly or Pelvis; as in cases of pregnancy, or in cases of the in- flammation of the Peritonaeum. On the other hand, the Diaphragm is the sole or the principal agent in respiration when the Ribs are broken; or when their motion is rendered very painful by an inflammation of the Pleura; or when their carti- lages become rigid, or are reduced to a state of bone, as frequently happens during old age.

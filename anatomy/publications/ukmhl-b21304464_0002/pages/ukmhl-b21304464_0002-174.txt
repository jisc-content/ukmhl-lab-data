OUTLINES OF ANATOMV. i rangeinents to which the Organs of Manclucation and Deglutition, from their peculiar office and situation, are exclusively exposed. • t Of the Organic Derangenients of the Organs of ' Ma?iducatioji and Deglutition. From the preceding very brief account of the functions of the organs concerned in Manduca- tion and Deglutition, it follows, that for the per- formance’of these functions, the cooperation and perfect action of many parts is necessary ; hence the various causes which impair or wholly impede deglutition. * ' Mastication is performed by the action of the Jaws and Teeth : hence, when the under Jaw is fractured or dislocated, it cannot perform the ne- cessary movements. The Teeth, from their situation and office, are much exposed to external violence and disease. They ar6 often inflamed, but do not swell. Spots of different colours are seen on the enamel of the Teeth. ‘ ‘ ' The enamel is sometimes discoloured, from chewing tobacco ; and it has been stated, that the bony parts of Teeth acquire a yellow hue from the Jaundice. * For a more full exposition of the various causes of Dys- phagia, see my Thesis qn that subject. - . . ^ •

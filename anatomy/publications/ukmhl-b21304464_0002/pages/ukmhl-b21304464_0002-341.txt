319 OF THE FEMALE MAMM«. The Mamma is surrounded by a dark-coloured line, called Areola j upon the surface of which, there are the orifices of glands which secrete a mucous fluid, in order to prevent excoriation. From the glandular parts of the Mammas, the smaller lactiferous tubes arise, which are united into twelve or sixteen larger tubes, most of which open near to the apex of the conical-shaped pro- jection of the Mamma, called its Papilla. In the Papilla, which is very elastic, the lac- tiferous tubes are coiled up within cellular sub- ' stance, in such a manner, that the milk does not flow through them until they are extended. The Mammas are largely supplied with blood from the External and Internal Mammary Arte- ries. The Nerves of the Mamma are derived from the Axillary Plexus. By the Breasts, the milk is secreted which is intended for the nourishment of the child for some time after birth. This secretion begins a little before delivery; and the milk continues to flow for many months, if the woman suckles her child. There is much difference as to the quantity of the milk which is secreted ; and even in the same woman in difier- ent pregnancies. The child, by means of its Lips, grasps the Nipple, which excludes the external air j it then it « . t s C t .

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. i6 The second Dens molaris has two points oh its base, rising almost equally on its out and in side. It has two roots, either separate or run together, but shorter than the root of the first. These two anterior grinders are much smaller than the three that are placed farther back in the mouth. The third and fourth are very broad in their bases, with four or five points standing out; and they have three or more roots. The fifth, called, commonly. Dens sapiential from its coming through the gums later than the other grinders, has four points on its base, which is not so large as the base of the third and fourth, and its roots are less numerous. The Incisorts of the upper jaw are broader than those of the lower jaw ; hence the superior grinders are placed farther back than the lower ones, that v.'hen they are brought together, by shutting the mouth, the points of the grinders of the one jaw enter into the depressions of the opposite grind- ers ; and they are all equally applied to each other, notwithstanding the inequality of their surfaces. From the numerous roots of the Dentes molares, the lateral pressure in grinding does not render them loose; and as the sockets in the upper jaw are more spongy, and theâ€™ teeth are more liable, by their situation, to fall out, * the grind- ers there have more numerous and more separat- * Galen, de Ossib. cap. v.

By the Arteries, blood flows to every part of the body ; and by the Veins it flows backwards ) and the Heart is the machine which assists in propel- ing the blood, and which is placed where the Ar- teries and Veins meet, in order to restore to the blood the momentum it had lost during the cir- culatioh. The blood, in passing outwards, flows from wider into narrower tubes ; and in returning, from narrower into wider vessels. The Arteries are placed on the inner sides of membranes, as far as possible out of danger. They pass within canals of the bones, as in the lower Jaw, or in grooves in the Ribs ; and take advantage of the processes of the bones. They are plaiced on the bending sides of the Joints, o- therwise they would be overstretched, and the flow of blood through them would be impeded. The larger Arteries are seated much deeper than \he Veins ; The cutaneous branches of these are small and short; whereas many of the trunks of the veins are seated under the skin, and many of their smaller branches are deep seated. \ The Arteries divide into numerous branches, somewhat like a tree j and are sent off from their

OF THE I'NGUllJAL CANAL OF T^IE FCETUS. 99 ed. In proof of which, take a new-born male, in whom the Tunica Vaginalis communicates with the cavity of the Abdomen, and make a puncture into the former, through w'hich one of the blades of a pair of scissars is to be introduced, and pass7 ed into the Belly, then all that portion of the Tunica Vaginalis, which is above the puncture, is to be snipped through. By doing this, we lay the Abdomen and Tunica Vaginalis into one, and we at the first glance perceive whether the cord, at this early period of life, passes in an oblique direction between the muscles and Transversalis Fascia. “ I have never observed the cord in any ob- vious degree oblique in its course ; in an infant at birth, it runs in a straight line from the Psoas Muscle to the bottom of the Scrotum. “ It passes through a mere aperture. “ When, however, we take a subject even a month old, and treat it in the same way, we find then a veiy apparent obliquity in the course of the cord. As, however, it is very rare to meet with an infant of that age, in whom the Tunica Vaginalis remains pervious, we may, where its Canal is obliterated, by slitting up Camper’s Fascia, and entering the blade of a sharp-pointed pair of scissars into the lower outlet of the Ca- nal, pass it up till it appears in contact with that part of the peritonieum which invests the cord at that spot where it passes from the Abdomen. If we divide completely what is between the blades, G 2

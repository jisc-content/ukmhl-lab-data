OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 358 * I CHAPTER II. OF ASSIMILATION AND NUTRITION; In the preceding chapter, It has been observed, that one great purpose of the circulation of the Blood, is the nutrition of the body. During the performance of the several functions of the animal economy, there is a constant dissi- pation of the parts which enter into the composw tion of the body. Every part of the human frame is In a state of constant change. The fluids are dissipated and the solids are abraded and absorbed, or much in-i ]ured, by the various accidents to which, during the progress of life, we are exposed. There must be some means for repairing the waste that is continually going on, and for the renovation of the various organs of the body when destroyed. There is a necessity not only for a renewal of the fluids, but also of the solids. The process by which the different parts of the body are renovated, has been called The Process of Assimilation, the nature of which process is very imperfectly understood.

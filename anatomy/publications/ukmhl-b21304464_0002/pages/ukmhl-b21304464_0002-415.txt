ON THE INTEllCOSTAL MUSCLES. 393 the reasons of the structure in the following man- ner: ‘ Nature, in order to give protection to the Heart and Lungs, has formed the Ribs as broad and fiat as possible, or left no more space be- tween them than is required for lodging muscles for their motion in respiration. Consistently with this view, as the R.ibs are fixed at both ends, so that they cannot be moved backwards and for- wards, but are confined to motion upwards and downwards, remaining nearly parallel to each o- ther, oblique muscles are preferred to straight; for if the former can, as I have before demon- strated, perform more extensive motion than the latter, even where both are of the same length, they must have a still greater effect, where the two kinds of muscles are confined between the same parallels. ‘ Thus, suppose the direct distance, or perpen- dicular drawn from one Rib to another, to be represented by three parts ; and that the Intercos- tal Muscle, in consequence of its obliquity, mea- sures five such parts; and that each of these is capable, when in action, of shortening itself one- fifth part of its length ; it appears from the de- monstration, that the oblique muscle can move the Rib through a space five times greater than the straight muscle can do. ‘ On accurate mensuration, I found the length pf the Intercostal Muscle to be one inch and a

OUTLINES OF anatomy. 3.3« rapidly from the smaller as from the larger ar- teries. 11. The blood, which is distributed by the branches of the Arteries, is brought back again by the Veins, which are continued from the small- er branches of the arteries, as may be seen in the pellucid parts of animals ; and, by throwing a penetrating liquor into an artery, it flows into the veins. I’he smaller veins uniting, form the larger ; wliilst the larger, by their union, form the Vena Cava Superior and Inferior. The former brings back the blood from the upper, the latter from the under parts of the body. 12. The return of the blood through the veins to the Heart is promoted by the muscular power of the vessels themselves ; the. action of the ad- joining muscles, and pulsation of neighbouring arteries ; and perhaps also by the column of blood in the veins, which, being always full, the eflect of the stream of blood a tei'go, must be consider- able in pushing on the blood. The reflux of the blood through the veins is prevented by the Valves within them. 13. The circulation of the Blood is proved by - the structure of the Heart, Arteries, and Veins; and by Ligatures. There are various causes which determine the * tent, appear to be at all affected by the multiplicity of * natural and artificial curvatures, or the flexures and con- ‘ volutions made by the different ramifications. ’

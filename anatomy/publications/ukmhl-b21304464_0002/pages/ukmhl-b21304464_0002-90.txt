OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 68 Sect. IX. MUSCLES OF THE PHARYNX. The Pharynx is covered behind by a thin, though very distinct, stratum of muscular fibres, which follow an oblique course. Vide Plate XXIV. The fibres of the right and left sides meet to- gether in the middle, in a white longitudinal line. Anatomists who preceded Albinus, divided this stratum into eight muscles, which they nam- ed from their attachments, and described these as distinct muscles, under the names Cephalo-Pha- ryngei, Pterygo-pharyngei, Mylo-pharyngei, Glos- so-pharyngei, Hyo-pharyngei, Syndesmo-pharyn- gei, Thyro-pharyngei, and Crico-pharyngei. Modern authors have divided these into three muscles only, under the names of Constrictor Pharyngis Superior, Medius, and Inferior. As all these fibres have a similar insertion, and . are subservient to a similar purpose; I shall de- scribe them as one muscle only. The upper part of the Constrictor Pharyngis takes its origin from the basis of the Cranium, from the Jaws, Palate, and Root of the Tongue j and it surrounds the upper part of the Pharynx ; and the lower portion of the muscle arises from the Thyroid and Cricoid Cartilages of the Larynx, and passes forwards to meet with its fellow. This stratum of muscular fibres contracts upon th&

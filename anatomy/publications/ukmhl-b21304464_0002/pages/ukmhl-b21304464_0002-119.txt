OF THE INGUINAL CANAL OF THE FCETUS. 97 \ t the Abdomen, we lose it where it enters the lowet orifice of the Inguinal Canal. â€œ In the foetus, or new born male, we find that the tendon of the External Oblique muscle, at its inferior and anterior parr, separates into two piU lars, which leave between them an irregular open- ing, through which the cord passes. One of these pillars runs below the cord, the other above it. Both pillars tend obliquely downward and forward, inclining toward the crest of the Pubes, W'here one is completely lost, the other in part im- planted. That fold which passes below the cord is completely implanted into the tough ligament which covers the tubercle of the Pubes. The other pillar, when it reaches the Pubes, separates into two bands ; the posterior, or deeper-seated, is inserted along with the lower pillar into the tubercle of the Pubes, and even extends to the opposite side. The other, and by far the most important fillet, winds obliquely inward ; then bending backward between the Penis and the Cord, it at last incorporates itself with the Fascia, covering the heads of the Triceps Longus, the Gracilis and Flexor Muscles of the leg ; and in some cases, it can be traced much farther, and reaches even to the tendon of the Glutseus Maxi- mus, to which it is attached. This slip from the upper pillar of the Canal, is always inseparably joined to the Fasciae covering the Cremaster ; in- deed, it may perhaps most properly be described VOL. II. G

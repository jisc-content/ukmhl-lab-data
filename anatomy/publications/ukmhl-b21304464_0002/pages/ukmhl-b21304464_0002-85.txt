Maxillo-hyoideus, or Mylo-liyoideus. \ This thin, flat, and broad muscle arises from a . ridge on the inner side of the jaw, which extends between the chin and last grinding teeth. The fibres pass forwards and downwards, to the sym- physis of the jaw, and are fixed into the body of the os hyoides. There is a portion of tendon in the middle of the muscles, of opposite sides, extend- ing from the symphysis of the lower jaw, to the base of the os hyoides. This muscle elevates the os hyoides j and, when the os hyoides is fixed, it may depress the under jaw.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 4 with one another, which is more or less favour- able to the exit or detention of the food, are by no means the same in different animals, and bear a relation to the kind of food. Thus, the alimen- tary canal of a graminivorous animal is not only much longer, and more complicated in its struc-. ture, but also much more capacious than that of a carnivorous animal, whose food contains more nourishment in smaller compass, and is more rea- dily digested. The alimentary canal of an animal designed to live partly on vegetable, and partly on animal food, holds a middle place between that of a car- nivorous and graminivorous animal. In this class, man ii included ; and, when the individual reaches to maturity, the alimentary canal is generally be- tween thirty and thirty-six feet long. In the lower classes of animals, the Alimentary Canal is of a very simple structure, consisting chiefly or solely of a bag, into which the food is received, and of an aperture through which it is discharged. But, in the higher classes of ani- mals, it is more complex in its form and appara- tus, being of considerable length, and enlarged in one or more places, to constitute a stomach or sto- machs ; and in such animals, the term Gullet is ap- plied to the canal which leads into the stomach, and the term Intestine^ to that which leads out from the stomach, and through which the food is conveyed out of the body.'

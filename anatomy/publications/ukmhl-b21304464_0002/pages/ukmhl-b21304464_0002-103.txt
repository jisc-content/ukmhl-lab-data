MUSCLES 6r THE PARIETES OF THE ABDOMEN. 51 Anatomical Description.'of the Internal Parts in the Male, - Upon removing the Peritoneum which lines the Abdominal, Iliaco-Internus, and Psoas Muscles, the Umbilical Arteries changed into ligaments, and the Urachus, come into view. The Sperma- tic vessels are also exposed ; and these sweep a- long the brim of the Pelvis, over the surface of the Iliacus Internus muscle *, and, upon reaching the Upper Abdominal Aperture, the Vas Deferens is added. The Spermatic Cord, thus formed, then passes obliquely downwards and forwards, , along the lower part of the Internal Oblique and Transverse muscles of the Abdomen in its course, receiving from the Internal Oblique the Cremaster muscle; and then, at the Under Abdominal Aperture, it suddenly forms an angle, which covers the insertion of the outer tendinous co- lumn of the External Oblique muscles into the Pu- bes, and then passes directly into the Scrotum. This peculiar course of the Spermatic Cord has been very faithfully represented by Vesalius, in the wooden plates affixed to his book, and also by Albinus. It was reserved for Mr Astley Cooper, to detect and describe the Upper Ab- dominal Aperture, which may be perceived by introducing the finger into the Under Ab- dominal Aperture, and, by pushing it up- VOL.

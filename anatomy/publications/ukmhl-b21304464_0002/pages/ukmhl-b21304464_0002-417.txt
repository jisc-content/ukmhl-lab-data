Â®F THE DIAPHRAGM, &C. 39S Of the Diaphragm, or Muscular Partition Z>e- txteen the Chest and Abdomen. In the natural state of Respiration, this muscle is the principal agent". This muscle is convex towards the Thorax during expiration, and concave towards the Ab- domen. It is composed of two distinct mus- cles, called the Larger or Uppei', and the Un- der or Smaller Diaphragm. The Larger Dia- phragm takes its rise from the Ensiform Car- tilage, from the Cartilages of the Seventh and Lower Ribs on both sides; and the fleshy fibres meet in a central tendon, which somewhat re- sembles the Heart in figure. On the right side of this Central Tendon, there is an aperture for the Vena Cava Inferior. This muscle is covered next the Chest by the Pleura, -and next the Ab- domen by the Peritonaeum. The Smaller Diaphiagm takes its rise by four Crura of unequal length. The Longer Crura a- rise from the fore part of the Fourth Lumbar Vertebra, and adhere to all the Vertebrae of the Loins, by means of a strong ligament. Between these Crura, there is an oval-shaped aperture for the Aorta and Thoracic Duct. The muscular fibres of the several organs of this muscle ascend, and in the middle unite, so ,3S to form two fleshy columns, which cross each

OF THE TEETH. ed roots than in the lower jaw. * The number, however, of the roots of the teeth of both jaws is very uncertain. Sometimes there are more, some- times fewer. Frequently the roots are joined together ; at other times they are all distinct. The disposition of such as are distinct is also va- rious ; for in some the roots stand out streight, in others they separate, and in others again they are crooked inwards. When the roots are unit- ed, we can still distinguish them, by remarking the number/of small holes at their points, which determine the number of roots each tooth ought to be reckoned to have, f Of the Formation of the First Set of TeetJu The teeth are formed upon Pulps, which are contained within the alveolar processes of the jaw. .*. â– * Upon examining the foetus in utero, about the fourth or fifth month after conception, we find that the alveolar processes are not completely formed. There is a la?'ge canal in the janv, which, at dif- ferent places, is imprest by the pulps of the teeth. Even at this very early period, this canal is not of a very uniform breadth.

Lastly, the nervous action is not only influen- ced by the quantity, but also by the quality of the blood. Sect. VI. OBSERVATIONS ON THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD. I shall subjoin, in the form of induction from the preceding account of the Structure of the Heart, Arteries and Veins, a few very general observations respecting the Circulation of the Blood. I. The blood which flows from the left side of the Heart is distributed by the arteries to almost every part of the body, and returns to the Heart

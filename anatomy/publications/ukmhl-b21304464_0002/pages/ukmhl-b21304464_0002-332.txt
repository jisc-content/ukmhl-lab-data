310 dUTLlNEa OF ANATOMY. The Iliac, Lumbar, Mesenteric, Casliac, and Bronchial Glands, were much enlarged. Their size varied from that of a dried pea to that of a walnut: one of the bronchial glands was about the size of a small henâ€™s egg. The enlarged Me- senteric Glands were of an oval figure, much flat- tened, and of a yellowish colour. There were a great many enlarged glaikls in that part of the Mesocolon attached to the Colon ; but I found no appearance of Glands upon the Coats of the small or large Intestines. Those Glands nearest the Intestines were of the smallest size. Those near to, or at what is called by Anatomists the Root of the Mesentery, were the largest. The natural texture of many of these Glands was in a great measure destroyed. No vessels could be seen in them, though some of them con- tained matter more or less fluid. The Lumbar Glands were filled tvith a matter like the fibrine of the blood. The Bronchial Glands were to the touch hard, and filled by a calcareous matter of a dirty white colour, and very like to chalk and water. Although almost all the Glands connected with the Absorbent System were considerably enlarg- ed, yet none of the Lacteals or Absorbents seem- ed to be dilated ; nor ^ere any of the Lacteal Vessels filled with Chyle. The arborescent course of the Absorbents of ' the Liver could be distinctly traced, as they were filled with Lymph. Unfortunately, in the remc-

92 OUTLINES OF ANATOWi'. who has described such a distribution of arteries in the case of Crural Hernia. In that'instance, the Obturator Artery arose from the same trunk as the Epigastric Artery, and then passed on the Pubal side of the neck of the Hernial Sac, and de- scribed a semicircle around the n^ck of the Sac. Baron Haller, Lieutaud, Richter, and Murray of Upsal, have described such an un- usual origin of the Obturator Artery ; but do not make mention of the proportion of cases in which it occurs. I have paid a good deal of attention to this de- partment of anatomy : In my observations on Crural Hernia, (published in 1803), I have stated, that I had not observed such a deviation from the usual distribution of the arteries in above one of tuenty-five or thirty cases ; and according to sub- sequent observation, such a distribution of arteries occurs in about one of twenty cases. I have also observed, that the short division is as common as the longer ; and as the Obturator Artery is only in danger of being divided by Gimbernat’s o- peration in the latter case, (indeed Mr Cooper asserts, that he had never met with the Obturator Artery passing around the neck of the Hernial ■Sac), hence such an unusual distribution of the ' Obturator Artery does not fomi so material an ob- jection to the operation for Crural Hernia, per- formed according to the method of Gimbernat, as has been supposed. There is still another variety as to the distribu-

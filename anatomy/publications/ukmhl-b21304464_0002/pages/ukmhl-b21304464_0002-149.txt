OP THE DUODENUU. Though the Duodenum at first sight be similar in structure to the other smaller Intestines, yet there is reason to suppose, that ,the alimentary mass is longer detained in the Duodenum, than in other parts of the smaller Intestine ; as it is much more capacious, more curved, and provided with a great number of Valvulae Conniventes. The assimilation of the alimentary mass with- in the Duodenum, is promoted by the addition of the Bi/e and Pancreatic Juice, by which acids, taken in along with our food, or generated by a morbid state of the Stomach, are blunted, and probably neutralized. The effect of the acid matter upon the aliment, is thus counteracted ; for, when Bile is mixed with any acid, the acidity takes off the bitter- ness of the Bile, and the bitterness of the Bile- takes off the acidity, and may perhaps bring about the separation of the Chyme, into the Chyle and excrementitious matter. The Bile is probably separated into two parts within the Duodenum, viz. into the Albuminous part, which flows into the blood along with the Chyle, and into another part, which communi- cates its colour and bitterness to the excrement, and which serves at the same time to stimulate the Intestinal Canal. On opening the smaller Intestines, we meet with a mucous and gelatinous fluid, mixed with their contents, and sometimes a wâ€™hite, and at other

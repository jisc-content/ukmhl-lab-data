In its course'to the Umbilicus, three tendin- ous lines pass across it; and between the Navel and the Ossa Pubis, there is a portion of tendon which extends only half way across the muscle. PuBio-suB-UMBlLiCALis, OT Pijramidalts. This muscle is named Pyramidal from its shape. The base of the pyramid is connected to the up- per part of the Symphysis Pubis ; and the apex of it is fixed into the Linea Alba, about half way between the Navel and Ossa Pubis. The muscles of the Parietes of the Abdomen, besides compressing the hollow bowels included within them, and also the bowels of the Pelvis ex- pelling their contents, tend to bend the body to a side, and draw the Ribs directly downwards; or, if the Thorax be fixed, the Pelvis is drawn up- wards: by their continued action, the heels may be thrown over the head. It may be proper to add, that the Internal Oblique muscle of the right side cooperates in its adion with the External Ob- lique of the left side. The tendinous sheath of the Sterno-pubalis preserves that muscle in its proper place when the body is bent. #

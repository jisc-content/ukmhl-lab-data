bP ftlE BLOODVESSELS OF THE LUNGS, ^7 SECT. IVi OF THE BLOODVESSELS OF THE LtJNGS. The Bloodvessels constitute a very important part of the organs of respiration. The purpose of respiration being to produce a change on the blood, by the operation of.the atmospherical air, the Lungs are constructed in such a mantief that fresh portions of atmospherical air are successive- ly admitted into them ; to which the blood is ex- posed : and thus, not only its colour, but also its properties, are materially altered j and it is ren- dered capable of stimulating the Heart, the Brain, and other organs of the body, to the due perform- ance of their several functions in the animal eco- nomy. The bloodvessels of the Lungs are derived from two different sources, the Pulmonary^n^ Bronchial Arteries^ The Pulmonary Artery takes its rise from the upper and anterior part of the Anterior Ventricle of the Heart; it divides into two great branches, which supply the right and left Lungs. Each of these branches is subdivided into a great number of smaller branches; which are distributed through every part of the substance of the Lungs, and on the air cells, in the form of a net-work. The corresponding Pulmonary Veins are united, and at length form four large veins, which dis- Bba â€˜

233 OF THE GALL-BLADDER. is smaller than the Hepatic Duct; has somewhat of a knotted appearance ; and within it there are several longitudinal folds, which considerably les- sen its canal. The Arteries of the Gall-Bladder are derived from the Hepatic Artery. Of the Structure of the Gall Ducts. • There are two coats proper to the Gall Ducts, an external fibrous coat, and an internal mucous lining; and, in some robust subjects, between these, a few pale coloured and very thin muscular fibres may be observed. Upon the inner membrane of the Ducts, the orifices of a number of mucous glands may also be observed. Within the Cystic Duct, there are from four- teen to eighteen transverse folds, which are some- what different as to breadth ; and also some folds which are disposed longitudinally, and w’hich, by crossing the transverse folds, form Cells. The same kind of structure may be observed in the Ductus Communis Choledochus; but the Cells are not so manifest as in the Cystic Duct, the transverse plicas being much smaller. These Ducts are remarkably dilatable. I have seen them, from Gall-stone Jaundice, extended to three times their natural bulk. ?;. • • f . .

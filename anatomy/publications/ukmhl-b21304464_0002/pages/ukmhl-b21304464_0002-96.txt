74 OUTLINES OP ANATOMY. The upper head adheres to the origins of the Serratus Amicus Major, and the lower to the Latissimus Dorsi. All the heads adhere to the neighbouring In- tercostal muscles. The different heads of the Oblique muscle are greater in breadth than in thickness. The fibres of the muscle proceed obliquely for- wards and downwards, and terminate in a thin tendinous Aponeurosis. The upper part of the muscle passes transverse- ly across the body, and is connected by its tendon to the lower part of the larger Pectoral muscle. Where the tendon of this muscle is united with that of the subjacent muscle, there is a curved white line visible, which has been called Linea Semilunaris. The tendons of the External Oblique muscles of opposite sides unite with each other, and form a distinct white line in the middle of the body, which extends from the Cartilago Ensiformis to the Pubes. The Linea Alba has therefore been described as the place where the one External 'Oblique muscle is inserted into the other. The larger fibres of the tendinous Aponeurosis attached to the lower portion of the External Ob- lique muscle, descend obliquely inwards and down- wards; are disposed in a parallel manner in respect to each other ; and between these there is a much phinner tendinous substance." The larger tendinous fibres of the External Ob-

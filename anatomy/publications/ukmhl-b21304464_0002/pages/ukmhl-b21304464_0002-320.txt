â€˜208 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Vessels, and Lymphatic Glands, than when giv- en by the mouth. Thus, also, the Small-pox has been disarmed of its virulence by inoculation. The variolous poison becomes less acrid during its passage through the Lymphatic Vessels, and Lymphatic Glands, than when the infection has been receiv- ed in the natural way j for the lungs are then primarily affected. The above circumstances led my Father, in HIS Treatise on the Lymphatic System, to propose Inoculation of the Measles, in order to diminish the severity of a disease, which, though in itself rarely fatal, is extremely apt to induce diseases of the Lungs. Dr Francis Home, about an year thereafter, endeavoured to communicate the Meades to chil- dren, by dipping lint in the blood of a patient who had the disease. The experiment was not attended with a favourable result. His success might probably have been greater, if the inocula- tion had been practised, as in the Small-pox. That my reader may gain a still more extensive view of this very important subject, I have sub- joined those conclusions which my Father.has annexed to his Treatise f on the Lymphatic System. f Vid. the 2d Edition of liis Treatise de Venis Lympha- ticis Valvulosis, Edinburgi, 1770, p. 101-119.

233 OUTLINES OF ANATOttlY. the second turn of the Duodenum ; from which part of it, there is a process called the Lesser Pan- creas^ which also is fixed to the Duodenum : and the left or smaller extremity is fixed to the Spleen by the Omentum Majus. The larger Lobes of the Pancreas are composed of smaller Lobules, from each of which there is a smaU Duct; and these smaller Ducts unite and form the larger Pancreatic Duct, which begins from the left extremity of the Pancreas ; and from the addition of the smaller branches it becomes gradually larger ; and at the right extremity of the Pancreas the Duct of the smaller Pancreas joins the larger Pancreatic Duct. To elucidate more fully the structure of the Pancreas, I have subjoined an engraving of that gland, as viewed by the microscope. The Duct which -has thin coats is placed in the middle of this glandular organ. The large Duct generally enters the.Duodenum along with, or near to, the Ductus Communis Choledochus. De Graaf, a great many years ago, by fixing a tube into the Duct of this gland, discovered that the liquor secreted by it was in all respects similar to spittle.

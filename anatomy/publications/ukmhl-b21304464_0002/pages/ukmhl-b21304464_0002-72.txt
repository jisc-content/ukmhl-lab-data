Second Layer, \ Under the portion of the Occipito-Frontalis Muscle, which is fixed into the superciliary ridge, a small rounded muscle is placed, which is fixed into the middle of the superciliary ridge, which has been called Corrugator SuperciUi. The Temporal muscle is seen in the temples, and its tendon passing under the Zygoma. A strong muscle, extending downward from the Zygoma to the angle of the under jaw, called from its very powerful effeft in manducation, Masseter, is dis- tinctly seen. The muscle called Buccinator, extending be- tween the Masseter and Orbicidaris Oris, is seen ; the fat, and that part of the parotid gland which covered it, being removed. Under the Levator Labii supetioris, there are a few scattering fibres, which Soemmering has noticed (vid. his third vol. p. 102.) as a muscle, under the name 6f Musetdus Anoynalus Maocillce superioris. The Levator AnguU Om is now seen arising from the superior maxillary bone, and fixed into the corner of the mouth. / Third Layer, In this third layer,â€™ Albinus has represented the insertion of the muscle which draws the eye-

GENERA^, DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 341 trunks at difterent angles; generally at an acute angle, and soraetiraes at a right or an obtuse an- gle; and at the place of the division, a projec- tion may be observed on the inside of the artery, formed by the internal coat. In general, the Arteries take the shortest road : thus less force is required. There are however some exceptions to the above observation; as in the case of the Arteries which lead to the Brain. The smaller branches of the Arteries are more exposed, and more convoluted in their course, than the larger branches, and more especially those distributed upon organs which undergo a rapid alteration as to their size, as those of the Lips, Stomach and Uterus; and in other cases, this convoluted course is probably subservient to se- cretion. Thus, the Spermatic Artery follows a long and tortuous course before it reaches the bo- dy of the Testicle ; and more especially that of quadrupeds. The arterial system has generally been compared to a cone, of which the apex is at the heart. The larger trunks of the Arteries are included in a considerable quantity of cellular substance j as in the Axilla, the Groin, &c. The branches from these trunks approach near- er to the surface of the body ; and these branches are subdivided into a number of smaller branches, and are more tortuous in their course. It is evident, that the sum of the branches of an Artery, exceeds in diameter the trunks from

EXTERNAL OBLIQUE MUSCLE OF THE ABDOMEN. 75 Kque muscle are united together by means of many thin tendinous fibres, which take their rise from the Crural Arch. These smaller connecting fibres are by no means equally manifest in every instance, being in some persons very small and flattened ; but in others, distinct, thick, and rounded cords; and, in Her- nia, sometimes become very large, and make a distinct impression on the Hernial Sac. * Sometimes these connecting fibres are entirely wanting. The under part of the tendon of the External Oblique muscle, stretched between the anterior su- perior spinous process of the Ilium, and the Sym- physis Pubis, is thicker and stronger than any other part of it, and somewhat rounded, espe- cially towards the Ossa Pubis, and has been de- scribed under the name of Poupartâ€™s Ligament; and more Jately it has been called by anatomists Crural Arch^ as it extends over the flexor muscles, great blood-vessels, and nerves of the thigh. This under part of the tendon was formerly .supposed to be attached only to the anterior su- perior spinous process of the Ilium, and the liga- ment of the Symphysis Pubis. Mr Gimbernat has, however, shown, that the tendon is doubled inwards, and forms a canal for the Spermatic Cord in'the male, and for the Roun^i Ligament of the female Uterus. * Vid.

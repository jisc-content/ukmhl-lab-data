OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. tween the Artery and Vein there is a distinct di- vision. Of the Crural Aperture. On the side of the Anterior Iliac Vein, next the Pubes, there is an aperture called Crural, somewhat of an oval figure, and considerably larger in the female than in the male, which is generally filled by a Cribriform membrane, through whidi tlie Lymphatics of the inferior extremities enter the Pelvis, and sometimes, though very rarely, by a membrane, which has somewhat of a ligamentous nature, and sometimes by Lymphatic Glands, and, according to Mr Cooper, also by a portion of the Fascia Transversalis. On the fore part of the Crural Aperture, the Crural Arch is placed behind the Pubes; and on the Pubal side of it, the thin border of the in- ternal part of the Crural Arch, sometimes called Gimbernatâ€™s Ligament, or the third insertion of the external oblique muscle, by Mr Astley Cooper. There is a considerable difference as to the fize of this aperture in the male and female. It is considerably larger in the latter, * owing to the greater size of the bones of the Pelvis, to the * The Plates in my Treatise upon the Morbid Anatomy of the Gullet, Stomach, and Intestines, clearly point out the distinctions between the size of the Crural Aperture in the male and female.

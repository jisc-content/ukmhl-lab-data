The Cornua of the * Os hyoides are stretched backwards from each side of its body, where often a small furrow points out the former separation ; for in young fubjefts, the body and Cornua are not one continued substance, as they come after- wards to be in adults. These Cornua are not al- ways streight, nor of equal length ; their two plain surfaces stand obliquely sloping from above outwards and downwards. Into the external, the * Cerato-glossus is inserted above, and the Thyro- hyoideus muscle below ; and to the one behind, the ligamentous membrane of the tongue and Larynx adheres. Each of the Cornua becomes gradually smaller, as it is extended from the base ; but ends in a round tubercle, from which a move- able cartilage stands out, which is connected to the upper process of the Carlilago Thyroidea. Where the body of the Os hyoides joins on each side with its Cornua, a small styliform process, called Appendix, j- rises upwards and backwards, into which the Musculi Stylo-hyoidei alteri, and part of the Hyo-glossi muscles are fixed. From each of them a ligament is sometimes extended to the Styloid processes of the temporal bones, to keep the Os hyoides from being drawn too much forwards or downwards.

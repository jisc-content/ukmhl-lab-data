That the position of the Stomach may be better understood, it is necessary to describe it in its undistended, and also in its distended state. The Stomach, when undistended, presents an anterior and poslei'ior surface ; a large and small curvature ; and two orifices, the Cardiac and Py- loric, 1â€™he Villous coats of the opposite sides of the Stomach arc contiguous to each other when the Stomach is empty. When the aliment is accu-- mulated within the Stomach, In consequence of the contraction of the Pylorus, the Stomach yields to the mechanical distension ; and its coats, which seem to be at first passive, then seem to adapt themselves to its contents. As the food is accumulated, the greater curva- ture of the stomach rises forwards and upwards, and occupies the space between the Cartilages of the Ribs, forming at the same time a considerable angle with the Gullet. The Pylorus is, as the name expresses, a vigi- lant sentinel, possessing great sensibility ; for the contents of the stomach are not discharged in the order they have entered the stomach, but in pro- portion as they have undergone the necessary changes within the stomach. When the aliment within the stomach has been converted into a homogeneous greyish fluid, called Chyme^ the Pylorus yields, and the contents of the stomach pass into the smaller Intestines.

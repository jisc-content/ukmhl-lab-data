OF THE VARIETIES OF CRURAL HERNIA. 199 \ scend in a direction perpendicular to the Abdo- men, and lye over the Pectineus muscle ; the Tu- mour is therefore very moveable. In consequence of the connexion of the Falciform Process of the * fascia with Poupartâ€™s Ligament, and the dura- tion of the disease, the Tumour is frequently re- flected over the Crural Arch, and is covered by the superficial fascia, skin, and cellular substance only. From the great looseness of the cellular sub- stance at the sides of the Tumour, it extends la- terally, so that the transverse is the longer diame- ter of the Tumour. This kind of Hernia some- times attains a considerable bulk, as in the annex- ed Plate (which is only half the size of nature) j or as in a case my Father met with, in which the Hernial Tumour was in size equal to both his fists. In this variety of Hernia, the Hernial Sac is remarkably thin, &c.; so that the vermiform con- tractions of the protruded portion of Intestine are visible, and the neck of the Tumour forms nearly a right angle with its body. In the seventh variety of Crural Hernia, the protruded bowels primarily enter the sheath of the Lymphatic Vessels, and then pass through holes for the transmission of vessels in the Falciform Process, and in the Superficial Fascia. The Tu- mour is in a great measure immoveable, and bears a very strong resemblance to enlarged Inguinal

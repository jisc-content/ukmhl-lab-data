Ai'ytenoidei Obliqui. The Arytenoidei Obliqui extend from the base of one of the Arytenoid Cartilages to the point of the other ; and the fibres of these muscles de- cussate each other like the strokes of the letter X.‘ These muscles are subservient to the same pur- pose as the preceding. Crico - A rytenoidei Latei'ales, These muscles take their origin from the sides' of the Cricoid Cartilage, where it is covered by the Thyroid ; and they are inserted into the sides of the bases of the Arytenoid Cartilages. These are the antagonists of the preceding muscles; by their cooperation they separate the Arytenoid Cartilages from each other, and dilate the Glottis.

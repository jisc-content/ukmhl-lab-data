39 OF THE PAROTID GLAND. ing - across the face, in part covers the mas- seter muscle, becoming there much thinner in its substance ; and it sends down a process which is in contact with the inferior maxillary gland. The form of this gland is oval; and somewhat flat- tened before and behind, and lengthened out from above downwards. The parotid gland is covered by the skin, and by some fibres of the platysma my- oides, and by a white membrane which envelops the substance of the gland ; and the external ca- rotid artery passes through the substance of the gland, dividing, within it, into three branches. Behind, we find the mastoid process; the ster- no-cleido-mastoid muscle, which covers the pos- terior part of the gland; a little deeper the digas- tric muscle; and, under it, the external carotid * artery. From the upper part of the gland, the large duct arises. . This gland, in the adult, is of a white colour, inclining to red. In the foetus it is much redder, and divided into a number of small parts, which have a soft and delicate texture. There is an accessory gland, situated close to the external border of the masseter, and along ' the upper border of the duct of the parotid. â€¢ This accessory gland does not always exist. Sometimes it sends out its peculiar ducts, w'hich unite with that of the Parotid. It is in colour and consistence like the Parotid,

I OF THE JNGUINAL CANAL.' 9a and therefore the bleeding could not be stopped by pressure. The Obturator Vein generally accompanies the Obturator Artery, and therefore may be divided at the same time as the artery, in performing the operation for Crural Hernia, as recommended by Gimbernat. Mr A. Burns of Glasgow, lately showed me a case of Crural Hernia, in which a large vein pass* ed along the inner part of the Crural Arch, and received the Epigastric Vein. In this case, if the division of the Crural Arch had been made di- rectly upwards, as has been recommended, that large vein must have been divided, and, on ac- count of the size of the vein, a great quantity of blood might have been lost. Such is the account of the parts concerned ifi Hernia, * which I have, for several years past, de- livered in my Courses of Lectures. But notwith- standing all that has been lately written upon the anatomy of the parts concerned in the Inguinal and Crural Hernias, there is a branch of the sub- ject which has not yet been explained to the Me- dical worldâ€”I mean the gradual formation of the Inguinal Canal. Having found that Mr Allan Burns, of Glasgow, had devoted a great share of attention I have emitted, in this book, the inferences deduced from the preceding account; for these I beg leave to refer the reader to the Morbid Anatomy of the Gullet, Stomach, &'C.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 204< 'Iâ€™hls system of vessels is generally filled by a white fluid, and has hence been supposed to be subservient to the generation of the animal, and, on account of the course of its smaller branches, has been called the Arborescent Ovaria. AH the species of Tceniae are said to be Herma- phrodite. Knots have been frequently observed in the Worm, which has led to the supposition, that as two pairs of the Oscula were in contact, the Worm was ill a state of copulation. This worm consists of a head, a chain of arti- culations, and a tail formed of a round joint j these articulations are quadrangular. The head is placed at the smaller, and the tail, which has an oval termination, at the larger ex- tremity of the worm. There are some who do not admit that the terms Head and Tail are cor- rect ; because each joint has its proper vessels, and is probably a separate animal, and capable of existing, independently of the other joints. The head is placed upon a sort of neck or con- tracted part of the worm, and when strictly exa- mined by the aid of a microscope, seems some- what of a square shape. In it there are five aper- tures. The one in the centre, which is circular, is the mouth of the animal, and is surrounded by a double margin, and a number of rays, which describe small portions of a circle, between which there are little projecting substances which pro-

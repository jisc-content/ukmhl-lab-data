229 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY* of the under part of the Chest, within which it is? placed, obliquely inclining downwards to the right side. The upper surface of the Liver, which corres- ponds with the concavity of the Diaphragm, is, upon a superficial examination, convex upon its upper surface; but, upon a more minute examina- tion, is found not to be perfectly uniform on its surface, for it is impressed by the heart, to which it is opposed. The Liver is divided into two great Lobes, whichj in the full grown person, are very unequal in point of bulk; that of the right side being much larger than the left. The right Lobe occupies the right Hypochon- driac Region, and a part of the Epigastric Re- gion ; and is in contact with the Pylorus, Colon, and upper part of the right Kidney. The left Lobe of the Liver is placed horizon- tally, and occupies a part of the left Hypochon- driac and Epigastric Regions. The under surface is much more irregular than its upper ; there are several remarkable eminences and fossae, which are filled by Bloodvessels, and also depressions made by the contiguous Viscera-. The raising the Liver also exposes the very un- equal thickness of this gland, which is thick and rounded where it is fixed to the, Diaphragm by means of the reflection of the Peritonaeum, called Coronary Ligament, but which becomes gradually thinner towards its fore part, which has hence

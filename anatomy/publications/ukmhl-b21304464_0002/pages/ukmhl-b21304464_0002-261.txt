239 EXPLANATION OP PLATE XXXI. EXPLANATION OF PLATE XXXI. Fig. I. represents the Pancreas, as seen by a common magnifying glass, after its Duct had been successfully injected. Fig. 2. represents the Pancreas more magnified. And Fig. 3. & 4. represent the Pancreas as seen un- der a microscope of very high powers, to show that there are no Acini in the structure of this gland. The arteries of the Pancreas are derived partly from the Hepatic, but chiefly from the Splenic Artery. The veins which correspond with these arteries assist in forming the Vena Portarum. The Nerves of the Pancreas are small, and are derived from the great Sympathetic and eighth pair.

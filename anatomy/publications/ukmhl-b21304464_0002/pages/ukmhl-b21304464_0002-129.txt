or THE INGUINAL CANAL OF THE ADULT. 107 its accession, are now so far changed in their ac- tion, that they present obstacles to the replace- ment of the Gut. If the Hernia has occurred in a young subject, where the Canal is not formed, or in an adult in whom the pofterior side is want- ing, which is not a very rare malformation, then our only difficulty mud depend on the action of the lower outlet. In this case, the cross fibres which bind the two pillars together, act on the Sac ; and the fillet, from the upper pillar, em- braces it closely, but not equally, in every direc- tion of the limb. When the toes are rolled in- ward, and the thigh, on the affected side, pulled from the other, and turned backward, this fillet is sunk into the Sac, and retains it iinmoveably in its situation. â€œ This species of stricture may most readily be overcome, by moving the member in an opposite way ; and, I believe, in knowing how to humour the parts in the Taxis, the great superiority of one surgeon over another consists. When, how- ever, the rupture has taken place in infancy, and continued till the complete extension of the Canal is accomplished, then, besides this source of dif- ficulty, there is also a source of embarrassment, arising from the reaction of the fibres of the Transversalis and Internal Oblique muscles upon the Sac, which occasion a species of stricture, in which bloodletting, warmth, and the relaxing the muscles by bending the body sideways, facilitate the reduction. The above remark applies to that

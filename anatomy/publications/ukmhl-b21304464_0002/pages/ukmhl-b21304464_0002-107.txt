85 OF THE FASCIA TRANSVERSALIS. smaller size of the lliacus Interims and Psoas Muscles, and chiefly, las I discovered, to the greater narrowness of the internal part of the Crural Arch, fixed into the Pubal part of the Linea Ilio-pectinea. Of the Fascia Transversalis. The attention of Anatomists has been lately drawn to a thin Fascia, * which is seen upon re- moving the Peritonaeum lining the Abdominal Muscles, which was discovered by Mr Cooper, f This Fascia lines the under part of the transverse muscle of the belly, is connected with the inner or posterior part of the Crural Arch, and then ascends for four or five inches upon the Trans- versalis Muscle of the Abdomen, upon the sur- face of which it is gradually loft. This fascia serves two important purposes : it shuts up the direct passage into the cavity of the belly, behind the under Abdominal aperture, and by dividing into the llial and Pubal Portions, forms in a great measure the upper Abdominal aper- ture. This Transversalis fascia is so dilatable, 4 that in Hernice of some standing, the upper aper- perture is nearly opposed to the under^aperture. * I have described this Fascia Transversalis, and Upper Abdominal Aperture, as in the parts dissected, which Mr Astley Cooper sent to me. t Mr Cooper has acknowledged, that, in some instan- ,ces, it is merely condensed Cellular substance.

ISO In the infant, it is not uncommon to meet with three, four, or five Intus-Susceptions at the same time ; sometimes there is a much greater num- ber, and all in the natural direction. In other instances, some are in the contrary direction; but in full-grown persons, such an appearance seldom presents itself. The extent of the Intus-Susceptio, or of the quantity of Intestine received within the other, varies from one or two, to eight, ten, nay, twenty inches. * Intus-Susceptio is much more common in the smaller, than in the larger Intestines. The Caput Coli has sometimes been found within a part of the Arch of the Colon, or one part of the Arch of the Colon within another, or the under part of the Sigmoid flexure of the Co- lon within the Rectum, or the C^cum; and the whole of the Colon sometimes passes through the Rectum, forming an external swelling, or Proci- dentia Ani. An Intus-Susceptio most frequently takes place when the contiguous Intestines are of unequal di- ameter. Hence the termination of the Ileum sometimes passes within the Colon ; and such a displacement very often proves fatal even to in- fants. The portion of Intestine which is in a state of Intus-susceptio, has sometimes been discharged by stool, and the patient has recovered.

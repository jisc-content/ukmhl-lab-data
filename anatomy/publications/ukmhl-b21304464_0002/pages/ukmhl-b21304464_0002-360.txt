338 OUTLINES OT ANATOMY. Of the Posteriort or Systematic Heart. The blood which was circulated through the Lungs flows by the medium of the four Pulmon- ary Veins into the posterior part of the Heart. The posterior Heart is very similar to the an- terior in its structure. There are four veins which communicate with the Auricle, which are rather smaller than the right; and the four Pulmonary Veins open into the upper and back part of the Auricle. From the posterior Ventricle the large artery < of the body issues, called Aorta ; the connexion of which with the Ventricle has been accurately described by Baron Haller. â€œ Caro Cordis in circuli perfect! formam ter- minator, et fibrce transversas Cordis, partim inter valvulas arteriosas per lineae longitudinem produ- cuntur, et aliquanto plus, partim in partem arte- riae, quae sinum valvulosum perfecit, pariter sur- sum pergunt, fere per sesquilineam, et accurate transversae cum alba pariter membrana arteriae connectuntur, cellulosae brevis telae ope, ut nul- la cordis fibram arteriam cominuetur. ** * The auricular part of the posterior Auricle is longer, but not so broad as that of the anterior Auricle. The valve between the Auricle and Ventricle is nearly similar to that of the anterior side of the * Halleri Element. Pbysioh lib. iv.- 1:

i20 OUTLINES OF ANATONfY. The human Larynx is, however, superior to all instruments made by human art. It is composed of Cartilages, so constructed, disposed, and articulated with each other, as to be susceptible of a great variety of motion ; and which are affected by those slighter tremors of the air that do not in the smallest degree influ- ence either a wind or chorded instrument. Be- sides, the vocal chords which alter and modify the tones of the voice are stretched in very vari- ous degrees by the muscles of the Larynx, and are fixed to elastic and flexible Cartilages ; where- as the chords of all musical instruments arc fixed to substances which possess these properties, so essential to harmony and variety of sound, in a very inferior degree. CHAPTER II OF THE GLANDS CONNECTED WTTH THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA. There are Glands of three different descriptions which arc connected with the Larynx and Tra- chea, viz. Mucous Glands, the Thyroid Gland, and Bronchial or Lymphatic Glands.

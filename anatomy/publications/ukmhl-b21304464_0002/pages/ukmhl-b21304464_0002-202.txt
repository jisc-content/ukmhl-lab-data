180 OUTLINES OP ANATOMT. EXPLANATION OF PLATE XXVIll. This plate, which was engraved from a very highly finiftied drawing by Mr Syme, gives a very good idea of the nature of a Fungous Tumour of the Villous Coat of the Stomach. The Sto- mach was divided nearly perpendicularly, with the view of exhibiting the Morbid state of the Coats of the Stomach, and the degree of con- traction at the Pylorus, produced in consequence of the deposition of matter like the white of an egg between the Villous and Muscular Coats of the Stomach, which had forced inwards the Vil- lous Coat. The albuminous matter is not of an equal thick- ness in every part of the Stomach ; it is consider- ably thicker at the Pylorus ; and formed Tumours which had the effect of straitening the passage through the Pylorus very considerably. The Coats of the Duodenum were in a sound state. All the neighbouring Glands were much en- larged, and there was an unusual determination of blood to them. A and B represent the Cardiac portion of the Stomach, where the Villous Coat is in a sound state. C and D point out the Fungus of the Villous Coat. F, G, H, I, point out the Glands connected â€¢ivith the Stomach, which were in a diseased state. K, the Duodenum in a sound state. I

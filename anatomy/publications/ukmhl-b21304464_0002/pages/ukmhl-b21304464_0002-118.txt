One plate we trace descending along the thigh, investing the Glands, and forming the sub- cutaneous Fascia; the other turns inwards, and incorporates itself with the fatty ligamentous substance found above the Pubes; adhering, in males, to the Ligamentum Suspensorium Penis ; and in females, to the Ligament of the Clitoris. Camper, the celebrated Dutch anatonist, adds, “ et involucrum dat musculo Cremasteri. ” Mr Astley Cooper also describes most accurately the Fascia, which he represents as originating from the aponeurosis of the Oblique Muscle, and invest- ing the Tunica Vaginalis, forming for it a sheath. This Fascia is naturally not very strong ; but in Hernia, it is sometimes immensely thickened. In one specimen of this disease in my possession, it is fully a quarter of an inch thick. “ When we divide longitudinally the sheath of the Cremaster or Camper’s Fascia, we bring in- to view the Tunica Vaginalis, covering the Sper- matic Cord ; and if we trace the latter up towards

06 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. there ig- no part of the body which exhibits a more remarkable instance of the variety, force, extent, velocity, and precision of muscular action. The Lingualis * is usually described as a ma&s of muscular fibres in the substance of the tongue, extending from the base to the point of the tongue, between the Hyo-glossus and Genio-glos- sus muscles. k may be proper to add, that this muscle is by noâ€™ means well defined, for its fibres are much involved in the adjacent muscles. This muscle, which is fixed into the tip of the tongue, raises the tip of the tongue, and brings it backwards. Myoglossus Muscle. This muscle arises from the base, and one of the Cornua of the Os Hyoides, and terminates in the side of the tongue, near the Stylo-glossus. This muscle depresses the edge of the tongpe. Genio-hyoglossus Muscle. This muscle arises from the symphysis of the under jaw ; and its fibres pass in a radiated man- ner to be fixed to the point, middle, and apex of the tongue, and are intimately mixed with those of the Lingualis and Hyoglossus muscles. The muscle is also attached to the body of the Os * There is certainly an impropriety in this term, as the names of the ether muscles which move the tongue are of Greek origin.

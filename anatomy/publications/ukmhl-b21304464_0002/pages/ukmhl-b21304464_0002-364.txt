The Arteries in their course are frequently unit- ed, or they form repeated anastomoses. Two large Arteries meet at an acute angle, and form a single trunk; or the arteries unite, and form arches, and the branches are given off from the convexity of the arch. Some Arteries, as the anterior Arteries of the Brain, are united by a transverse arch. i Of Varieties in the Arterial System, â€¢ I I T t The Arteries of the body gradually increase with the bulk of the body ; and when the size of the part varies, so does that of the Artery pro- per to it. These varieties are temporary, or permanent. Xhe Gravid Uterus affords an example of the former. As that organ increases in bulk, its Ar- teries are much enlarged ; but, after delivery, the bulk of the organ, and also that of its Arteries, are much diminished. In the same manner, the Arteries in the vicinity of a Tumour acquire an unnatural size ; but upon the Tumour being re- moved, they shrink ; but if that Tumour cannot be removed, the increase in the size of the vessel is permanent.

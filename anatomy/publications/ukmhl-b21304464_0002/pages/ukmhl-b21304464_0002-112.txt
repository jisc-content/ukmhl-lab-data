90 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY, When the Epigastric Artery takes its usual origin from the anterior Iliac Artery, its smaller branches, in some cases, pass along that part of the Crural Arch called Gimbernatâ€™s Ligament, in their course to the Symphysis Pubis. I have a specimen in which the Epigastric Ar- tery takes its rise from the Obturator, and passes upwards and inwards to the Rectus muscle. Besides the Epigastric Artery, there is another artery which is in danger of being wounded in performing the operation for Crural Hernia. I allude to the Obturator Artery which com- monly arises from the posterior Iliac Artery; but sometimes, as in fig. ist, Plate XV. takes its ori- gin in common with the Epigastric Artery from the anterior Iliac. The trunk common to the Obturator and Epi- gastric Arteries, is sometimes a quarter of an inch in length; in other instances, it measures from an inch to an inch and a half ; and I have met with it of all intermediate lengths. If the common trunk be only a fourth of an inch long, the Obturator Artery runs on that side of the sac, which is next to the anterior Spinous process of the Ilium, and cannot be displaced, being firmly bound down by cellular substance ; and therefore, cannot be injured, in that kind of Crural Hernia in which the displaced bowels are lodged within the sheath of the Lymphatic ves- sels, by dividing that part of the Crural Arch

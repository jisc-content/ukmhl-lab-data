OF THE CRICOID CARTILAGE, 413 Of the Cricoid Cartilage. The Cricoid Cartilage forms the base on which the Thyroid and Arytenoid Cartilages are fixed by means of articular surfaces. This Cartilage is circular, and narrower before than behind, where it rises up between the wings of the Thy- roid Cartilage ; and on this posterior part of the Cartilage there are smooth surfaces; by which the Arytenoid Cartilages are articulated with the Cri- coid Cartilage. The posterior surface is divided by a ridge in- to two lateral cavities for the Crico-Arytenoidei Postici Muscles. The inferior part of the Cricoid Cartilage is placed horizontally, and is connected with the upper part of the Windpipe. The superior part of this Cartilage is connected to the Thyroid by a distinct membrane, and rises tip between the w'ings of the Thyroid Cartilage. Of the Arytenoid or Vyramidol Cartilages.' The Arytenoid Cartilages constitute the most important part of the Larynx, being connected â€¢with the Chords, upon the state of which the voice more immediately depends j and the move- ments of these Cartilages tend also to the enlarge- ment, or diminution, of the aperture of the Glottis.

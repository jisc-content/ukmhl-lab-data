ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE OMENTA. 2SI Sect. IV. OF THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE OMENTA. The Omentum is subject to the same organic derangements as the subcutaneous fat. It is frequently inflamed, and contracts adhe- sions with the neighbouring parts ; and, in the case of a Tumour of the Stomach and Intestines, it generally adheres to it. Steatoms are sometimes connected with the O- mentum ; so that it somewhat resembles a bunch of grapes. Scirrhus of the Omentum, also, has been de- scribed. Hydatids are sometimes connected to the Omentum; and water has been collected within the Sac of the Omentum. The Omentum has frequently been found gan- grenous, in cases of strangulated Hernia:.

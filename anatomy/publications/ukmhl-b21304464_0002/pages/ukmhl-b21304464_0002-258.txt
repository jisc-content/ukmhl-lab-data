The Spleen is an organ of a spongy consist-, ence, of a livid colour, variable as to shape and length, generally approaching to an oval form j convex on its upper surface, which is received in- to a corresponding concavity of the Diaphragm ; concave towards the Stomach, to which it is con- nected by the Peritonaeum, Cellular Membrane, the greater Omentum, and by bloodvessels and nerves. The Spleen occupies a share of the left Hypo- chondriac Region, between the left extremity of the Stomach and the false Ribs, but changes its place along with the Stomach, and also during inspiration. The Spleen is generally about five or six inch- es long ; but sometimes there is a larger, and one or two small Spleens. The Spleen has two coats, one of which is de- rived from the Peritonaeum ; the other is proper to it, and but loosely connected to it. The Spleen is also connected to the Pancreas jby bloodvessels, and by the Peritonaeum.

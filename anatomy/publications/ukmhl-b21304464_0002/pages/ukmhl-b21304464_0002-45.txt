OF THE TEETH. 23 ing the wisdom teeth, are ossified; so that, at this period, there are t\o less than forty-eight teeth in the jaws : the first set, consisting of twenty, have appeared ; and the second set, consisting of twen- ty-eight, lye within the jaws. The sixth tooth, or first large molares of the adult, is also dormant. â€¢ The first set of teeth fall out in consequence of their roots being absorbed, which absorption takes place in consequence of the enlargement of the second setj by which, pressure is made on the bony partitions between the sockets of the first and second set of teeth, and also on the roots of the first set of teeth j which leads to the absorption of the bony partitions, as well as of the roots of the first set. In consequence of the above changes, the se- cond set comes forwards, and replaces the first, but are contained in their original sockets. The first set generally begin to fall out when the child is about six or seven years old. The anterior molares of the second set gene- rally appear first; then the larger incisors of the lower jaw ; in a month or two, the larger incisors of the upper jaw; then the molares of the child become loose, to make way for the smaller mo- lares of the second set : the canine generally fol- low some time after j and, last of all, the larger molares. The shedding of the first set is generally not completed in less than six years j and in some

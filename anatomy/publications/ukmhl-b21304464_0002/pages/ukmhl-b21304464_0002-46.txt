The second set, like the first, is formed upon pulps, and these jmlps are j^f^^'ts or elongations of the pulps of the first set, which are sent out as soon as the rudiments of the first set have made some progress. The pulps of the second set of teeth are origi- nally xvithin the same socket, and adhci'e to the cap- sules of the first set; and these capsules are so inti- mately connected, that it is impossible to separate the one from the other, without lacerating one or both. By degrees little niches are formed in the internal alveolar plate, which gradually form a distinct socket around these sacs for the second set of teeth. Dr Blake, who, I believe, discovered the con- nexion between the sacs of the first and second sets, has very fully explained the above mentioned facts in the following passage. ‘ As the sacs of the permanent teeth advance, * the sockets of the temporary ones become en- ‘ larged, and little niches are formed in the in- ‘ ternal plate of the alveolar processes, answering ‘ to each socket, which are situated rather later- ‘ ally, that is to say, at a greater distance from ‘ the symphysis, or centre of the jaw, than the ‘ centre of each respective temporary socket. ‘ These niches do not penetrate so deep as to j

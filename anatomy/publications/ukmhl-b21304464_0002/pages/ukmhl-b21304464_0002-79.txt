OF THE MUSCLES OF THE LIPS. 57 The Mento-Labialis, or Depressor Lahii Inferioris. This muscle arises from the anterior, but chief- ly from the lateral part of the under jaw. The fibres of this muscle pass obliquely up- wards and inwards, till it joins its fellow in the middle of the lip ; and is fixed by a broad plate of muscular fibres into .the under lip. This muscle opens the mouth, by deprefling the under lip.

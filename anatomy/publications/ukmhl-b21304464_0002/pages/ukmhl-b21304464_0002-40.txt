i8 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. the teeth, and therefore considerably broader at the back than at the fore part. In the bottom of this groove, the internal maxillary bloodvessels and nerves are disposed, which afterwards are lodged in a distinct canal. In a short time, there are a number of ridges, •which extend from the bottom and inner sides of this canal, and which form sockets for the teeth. These sockets extend very quickly, and con- tract at their upper parts ; so that, at the time of birth, there is found only beneath the gum a small transverse fissure. In consequence of this structure, the teeth with- ' ■ in the jaw are not injured while the child is suck- ing. The alveolar processes of the grinding teeth are situated immediately before the tuberosities of the upper jaw, and the coronoid processes of the under jaw. The pulps of the teeth are involved in capsules, which consist of two membranes, in both of which there is a great number of bloodvessels. The ex- ternal membrane adheres to the gum, and the in- ternal to the pulp. The pulps of the teeth are at first of a gelati- nous consistence, nearly of the figure of the tooth, and adhere to the inner surfaces of the gums. 'The pulp of each tooth is contained in its proper capsule, which is shaped like the base of the tooth, but without roots j which capsule

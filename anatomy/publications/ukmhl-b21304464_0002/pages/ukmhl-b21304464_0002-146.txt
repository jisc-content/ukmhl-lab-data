m OUTLINES OF ANATOMY^ Air within the Stomach and Intestines. In the healthy state of the digestive power, air, though certainly generated, is immediately re- absorbed, and therefore no air is found either to distend the Stomach, or is emitted from it. Wherever, therefore, air is contained in the Stomach, it affords evidence of an imperfect di- gestion, and that the animal fermentative process, which takes place in vegetable and animal matter, placed in certain circumstances out of the body, has in these instances taken place within it. From Mr JuRiN of Geneva’s experiments made on air emitted from the Stomach, it appears, that it consisted chiefly of azote, with a small propor- tion of carbonic acid gas, and a still smaller pro- portion of oxygen. Other experiments seem to shew that it is chiefly carbonic acid. same class, some eating that kind of food with impunity, which proves a poison to others ; a fact which I have already taken notice of in my Thesis, ' Quasdam tamen res quibusdam ani- ‘ malibus lethales, aliis animantibus ininime nocere, notandum * est; sic, capri cicuta, vaccis perniciosissima, impune vescim- ‘ tur; porci hyoscyamo pinguescunt; equus vitri antimonii ‘ quantitatcm quae centum homines necaret, impune tolerare ' potest; canis opii copiam homini huic non assucto lethalem, ‘ sine periculo devorare potest: Contra autem, dosis jalapa? aut ‘ nucis vomicae, aut amygdalae paucae amarae, eundcm convcl- * lerent aut extingucrent.’

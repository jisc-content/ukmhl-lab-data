78 OUTLINES OF ANATOMT< A PERTURB,is folded under the Spermatic Cord, and round ligament of the female'; and passes in- wards, and is inserted into the Spinous process of the Os Pubis, and Linea Ilio-pectinea, (a term used by my Grandfather in his Osteology), for the space of about an inch, or a little more. Some have described this insertion of the un- der column as a distinct ligament. In the erect posture, this part of the tendon of the External Oblique is placed almost horizontal- ly, and is much deeper than the upper part of the tendon. The upper and under parts of the tendon of the External Oblique muscle are widely different in another respect: The upper and outer is a thick rounded cord, extending from the spine of the Os Ilium to the tubercle and symphysis of the Pubes : the under is reflected backwards and in- wards, and is extended over the femoral blood- vessels ; and its posterior edge is very thin. The Crural blood-vessels. Lymphatics of the mferior extremities, the internal Iliac and Psoas muscles, and the protruded bowels, in cases of Crural Hernia, pass behind the Crural Arch. f Ilio-abdominalis Medius, or OUiquus Ahdominh Inta-nus. This muscle arises from the spine of the Ilium, by a thin tendon common to the Serratus Posti- cus Inferior, and the Latissimus Dorsi j from the

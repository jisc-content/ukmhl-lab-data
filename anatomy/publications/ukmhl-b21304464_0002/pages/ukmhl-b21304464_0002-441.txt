OF THE PHYSIOLOGY OP THE LARYNX. 419 * The Larynx is composed of elastic Cartilages, each of which is well calculated for vibrating. The sound of the voice is occasioned by the vibrations to which the air expelled from the Lungs is exposed in passing through the Glottis. Sounds are grave, or acute and loud, according to the size of the Larynx and of the aperture of the Glottis, and the tension of the Vocal Chords. That the Larynx is the principal seat of the voice may be proved by a siniple experiment. By opening the Windpipe below the Larynx the voice â€¢ is lost. f It seems probable, that the sound of the voice has some connexion with the capacity of the La- rynx : hence the very remarkable difference in the sound of the voice, when the Larynx is raised or depressed, in the different sexes, and at dif- ferent periods of life. The above observation is applicable to the case of eunuchs, whose tones of voice and I.arynx resemble those of the fe- male : hence also the similarity of the voice of infants of both sexes at the period of birth, whose Larynxes are similar in size and form : hence the remarkable distinction between the sound of the voice in the different sexes after puberty, when the Larynx of the male is much expanded. The human voice has been compared by some authors fo a Jlute; by others, to a chorded imlrU' mail.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. diated fleshy fibres, which, as they descend, be- come thicker, and which pass under the Zygoma, filling up the space between it and the Temporal bone; and also from the inner surface of the Zygoma. This muscle is fixed into the cofonoid process of the under jaw, by the medium of a tendon/ which envelops the coronoid process; The muscle is covered by a thick tendinous aponeurosis, which is connected with the Tem- jjoral ridge, the superior edge of the Zygoma, and outer edge of the Orbit* The above muscle elevates the under jaw ; but it may act with its anterior or posterior fibres in drawing the tinder jaw backwards or forwards. e Ztgomato-Maxillaris, or MasseteVf Is a thick strong muscle, which covers and deeply imprints the side of the under jaw-bone. It takes its origin from the superior Maxilla, and from the inner edge of the Zygoma; and is fixed into the side and angle of the under jaw. The fibres of the different parts of this muscle cross each other j the outer part slants back- wards, and the inner part forwards, so that the fibres in a degree decussate one another. This muscle concurs with the former in elevat- ing the under jaw. The outer part of it also affifts in pulling the jaw forwards;

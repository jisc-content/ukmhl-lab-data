The disease generally begins in the Mucous Glands, and is propagated to the Cellular sub- stancei which is converted into a dense Cellular substance. The Peritoneal Coat acquires an unnatural hard- ness, and resembles the coarser kinds of parch- ment, and, in some cases, acquires the transpar- ency of horn; in others, it attains an unnatural thickness. The muscular fibres of the Muscular Coat are seldom to be seen, and, when visible, are gene- rally of a paler colour than natural, and are se- parated from each other by Cartilaginous Septa of dlfl'erent thicknesses in different cases.

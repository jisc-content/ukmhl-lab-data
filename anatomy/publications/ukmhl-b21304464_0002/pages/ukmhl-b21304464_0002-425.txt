Inflammation of the Lungs is extremely fre- quent in our variable climate; and the Lungs, when so diseased, bear a strong resemblance, in consistence and colour, to the Liver, being red- der than the healthy Lungs, and so solid as to sink in water. The inflammation is on some oc- casions general, on others partial; and the in- flamed part is frequently covered by a layer of coagulable Lymph, the thickness of which varies in different cases, by which the Lungs are firmly fixed to the Pleura Costalis. The inflammation of the Lungs is often accom- panied by an inflammation of the Pleura, and by an effusion of turbid serum into the Sac of the Pleura of the affected side.

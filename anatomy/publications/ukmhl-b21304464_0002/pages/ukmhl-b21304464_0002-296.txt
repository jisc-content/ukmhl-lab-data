OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. The first effect of concentrated sulphuric acid was to change its light brown colour to a cochin- eal red. Notwithstanding, the solution of this substance in the acid, which readily takes place, without even the application of heat, is not redj but of an olive green colour ; and it remains so even when diluted with water, no apparent altera- tion of any kind occurring. “ Nitric acid, like the sulphuric, reddened this substance ; and the solution, which rapidly form- ed, and without any effervescence, being produced, was 9f a reddish brown colour. The addition of water to the solution occasioned the separation of a reddish white matter. “ The action of muriatic acid on it was not so decided, or nearly so powerful, as that of the two preceding acids. The acid retained its former colour ; but that part of the substance which re- mained undissolved was nearly white. “ The ammoniacal solution was of a yellow colour. “ This substance melts when gently heated, and takes fire w'hen exposed to a sufficiently high temperature; and burns with a dense yellow fiame. “ Thirteen grains of It, burnt In a platina cruci- ble, afforded only -^-ths of a grain of white earthy matter ; which, as it reddened turmeric paper, and effervesced with nitric acid, appeared to contain carbonated alkali j and, as nitric acid entirely dis- solved it, and the solution was rendered turbjd by

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. . S30 T he fibres pass in different directions ; and, in some places, are collected into fasciculi, and which, ijn others, cross each other. The Pericardium, which in figure somewhat re- sembles a cone, is firmly supported in its situation by its external coat, which it receives from the Pleura: hence the Heart is not affected by the play of the Lungs during respiration. The Pericardium also adheres to the middle tendon of the Diaphragm, and also to the muscu- lar part of that muscle, opposite to the fifth Rib. The Pericardium is much more capacious than the Heart, and capable of containing the Heart when all its cavities are distended at the same mo- ment, (which never happens during life) : hence the heart slides readily within the Pericardium, and thereby adapts itself in some measure to the situation of the body. At the upper and anterior part the Pericardium is contracted, and forms a sort of process which surrounds the large vessels which are connected with the Heart; it is reflected upon the Aorta, Pulmonary Artery, and Veins; so that there cannot be said to be apertures in the Pericardium. The Pericardium is also supported by the Me- diastinum Anterius ; hence the Bloodvessels of the Heart cannot be elongated and contracted in their diameter ; and, from the same cause, the Heart cannot press upon the Lungs.

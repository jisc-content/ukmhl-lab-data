398 OHTLINES OP ANATOMV, Sect. VII. OF THE EFFECTS OF RESPIRATION UPON TI^E ATMOSPHERICAL AIR. The quantity of air which is inspired has been very differently rated. According to the most accurate experiments, about forty cubic inches of air are inspired. Air that has passed through the Lungs differs from atmospherical air, ist. In containing a con- siderable proportion of carbonic acid gas, as was distinctly proved by Dr Blactc, by expiring through lime-water, which is thereby rendered turbid, the carbonate of lime being insoluble in water. 2. Air that has been breathed contains less oxygene gas. 3. The bulk of the inspired air is somewhat diminished. The quantity of air that is expired is nearly e- qual to that which is inspired. There is also a small quantity of an aqueous vapour discharged from the Lungs,

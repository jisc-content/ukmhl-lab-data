0VT1.1NKS or anatomy/ 118 empty stomach, or by thrusting a piece of dried sponge into the stomach to collect it, or by collecting it from the stomach of an animal recently killed, is still an impjire Jluid, being mixed with Mucus and Saliva, and sometimes with Bile. Dr SiLVENs’s experiments with perforated balls have pointed out, that there is a considerable dis- tinction between the Gastric Juice of a carnivorous and graminivorous animal. He gave to oxen and sheep, balls filled with animal substances, which were not dissolved; but when the balls were filled with grass, it was con- sumed. From the experiments which Mauquart and Vauquelin made on the Gastric Juice of sheep, it appears that sometimes the uncombined phos- phoric acid is present; but on other occasions,* ■no acid ; and from the experiments of Spallan- ;2ANi, it seems to partake neither of an acid nor of an alkaline nature. The Gastric Juice, particularly in young ani- mals, has the property of coagulating milk. The coagulated milk thrown up by infants immediate- ly after sucking, and the well-known use of the stomach of the calf in our dairies, sufficiently prove this fact. Dr Young found that the Stomach retained this power after being repeatedly washed, and that the infusion of a portion of the Stomach em- ployed as runnet, did not lose its coagulating power though mixed with an alkali,

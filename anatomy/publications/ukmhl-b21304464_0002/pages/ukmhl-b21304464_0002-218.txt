The neck of the Hernial Tumour is covered by the upper insertion of the Falciform process of the Fascia Lata ; and the Epigastric Artery is situated on the Ilial side of the Tumour, and about an inch from it. In the second variety of Crural Hernia, ttie protrusion of the bowels takes place through an aperture in the membrane which passes across the Crural Aperture ; a Lymphatic Gland which had filled up that aperture, having been displaced, and pushed to the Ilial side of the Crural Hernia. The stricture in this instance is sometimes oc- casioned by the sides of the aperture through which the protruded Intestine had passed. This variety is peculiar, in wanting the Fascia Propria. The third variety of Crural Flernia is that in which the protruded bowels pass into the sheath surrounding the Femoral Lymphatics, and then escape by one of the apertures, through which the Lymphatic Vessels enter the Sheath, as has Hernia is examined, this Fascia is only found to proceed upwards, as fur as the edge of the orifice on the inner side of the Crural Sheath, by which the Hernia descends; but In a small Hernia it passes into the Abdohicn as far as the Peritonscum, and forms a pouch, from w^hich the Hernial Sac may be withdrawn, leaving this, forming a, complets bag over the Hernia. ‚Äù /

225 OF THE LIVER OF THE ADULT. The depressions upon the under surfaces of the Right Lobe, which lodge the Gall-Bladder, He- patic Flexure of the Colon, Right Kidney, and Renal Capsule, and also that on the Left Lobe, which corresponds with the Stomach, merit at- tention, as pointing out the relative situation of one bowel to another. . The upper and under surfaces of the Liver are remarkably smooth, and have a shining appear- ance, being covered by the Peritonaeum. The Peritoneal covering is internally irregular, and intimately attached to a very thin Coat, which not only covers the surface, but also enters into the substance of the Liver, and may be seen pass- ing around the larger branches of the Vena Porta- rum, on making a section of the Liver. This second Coat seems to be merelv condens- j ed cellular substanccj and does not exhibit a fi- brous structure; and is not, like the Peritoneal Coat, elastic and extensible. The substance of the Liver is very readily bro- ken down. On pressing the Liver between the fingers, it may be readily broken down ; and a number of small hard bodies, of different figures, and a- bout the size of a millet seed, may be perceived. These are what have been named the Acmi of the lAven VOL. II. P

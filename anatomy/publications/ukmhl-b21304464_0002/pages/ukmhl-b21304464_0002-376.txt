OCTLIKES OF ANATOMV. 35* 7. In consequence of the contraction of the ventricles of the Heart, the blood is thrown with considerable force into the Pulmonary Artery and Aorta, and their ramifications ; while the arteries, being exposed to the impulse of the blood from the ventricles, are provided with coats of consi- derable strength ; which, being muscular, assist the Heart in propelling the blood ; adapt them- selves to the quantity of blood ; and, in the case of bleeding, by their contraction stop the flow of blood. 8. That there is a muscular contractile power proper to the arteries, is evident from various cir- cumstances. A. From the effects of local stimuli, which excite an increased action of the arteries. B. From a haemorrhagy being stopped by the contraction of the coats of the artery. C. From gangrene of the feet succeeding the ossification of the coats of the femoral artery. D. From the circulation being continued when the Heart is wanting. E. From the effects of palsy upon the Arteries. 9. When the Fleart contracts, the Arteries are at that instant dilated ; and in this state, we per- ceive their pulsatory motion. That the pulse is owing to the dilatation of the coats of the artery, may be made obvious (Bichat states) by trans- fusing the blood from an artery of a living ani- mal into the Humeral Artery of a dead body, â– which thereby acquires pulsation.

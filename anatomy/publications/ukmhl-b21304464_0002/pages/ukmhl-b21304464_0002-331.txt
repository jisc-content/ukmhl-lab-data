ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. SOO CHAPTER I. OF THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. The Coats of the Lymphatic Vessels are similat to the serous membranes, and subject to similar Organic derangements, Inflammation, Adhesion, and Ossification. The Lymphatic Vessels some- times are much enlarged, or become Varicose, and sometimes are ruptured. * The Lymphatic Glands are much exposed to disease. They are frequently enlarged from Lues Venerea, Cancer, Scirrhus and Scrofula, by which they are filled by a matter like cheese j and some- times these glands are filled by bone. ScHREB has described a Calculus, which he found within the Thoracic Duct. In a case of a Diabetes, I found the Absorbent System in a very peculiar state. * Mr White of Manchester has imputed the Plilegmasia doleus to a rupture of the Lymphatic Vessels.

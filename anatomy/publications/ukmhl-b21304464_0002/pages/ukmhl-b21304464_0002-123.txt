OF THE INGUINAL CANAL OF THE INFANT. 101 or pencil-case. When he has done this, he has a very good plan of the state of parts about the Groin in the Foetus. If he now hold the papers opposite him, and then pull to a side the one near- est to himself, he will find, that by doing this, he comes to lay the quill between the pieces of paper in the same way that the Spermatic Cord, by the extension upward and outward of the Internal Orifice of the Ring, comes to be lodged in a long Canal. And he will also see, that the length of the Canal must vary according to the greater or less extensimi of its posterior side. Many have also been puzzled to comprehend how the Epi- gastric Artery can bear precisely the same rela- tion to the Cord in the Foetus and Adult, seeing the difference which has taken place in the rela- tive position of the Internal Orifice of the Canal. This difficulty only occurs to those who do not properly understand the mechanism of the parts. One who has made himself acquainted with the - real structure, is never difficulted in following the changes. If the state of parts in the very young subject be known, and if the surgeon have exa- mined those at an advanced period of life, by comparing the one with the other, he has at once unfolded to him the mode in which the Foetal Ring is changed into the Adult Canal. He is taught, that it is a natural consequence oj the ob- lique extensioii of the Traiisversalis Fascia toward the Spine of the Ilium. He sees that, in propor- tion to the degree in which the posterior side of

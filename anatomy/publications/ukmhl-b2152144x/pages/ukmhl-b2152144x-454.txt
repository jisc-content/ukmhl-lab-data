This section, from exhibiting the largest surface of medullary sub- stance demonstrable in a single hemisphere, is called centrum ovale miniis ; it is spotted by numerous small red points (puncta vascu- losa) which are produced by the escape of blood from the cut ends of minute arteries and veins. Separate carefully the two hemispheres of the cerebrum, and a broad band of white substance (corpus callosum) will be seen to Fig. 157.* connect them ; it will be seen also that the surface of the hemisphere where it comes in contact with the corpus callosum is bounded by a large convolution (gyrus fornicatus) which lies horizontally on that body, and may be traced forwards and backwards to the base of the brain, terminating by each extremity at the fissure of Sylvius.

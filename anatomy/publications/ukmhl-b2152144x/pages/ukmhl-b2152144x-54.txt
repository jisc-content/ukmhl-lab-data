TEMPOEAL BONE. 30 Development.—By tioo centres, one for each lateral half. Ossi- fication begins in the orbital arches, somewhat before the vertebrae. The two pieces are separate at birth, and unite by suture during the first year, the suture sometimes remaining permanent through life. The frontal sinuses make their appearance during the first year, and increase in size until old age. Articulations.—With tioelve hone^ : two parietal, sphenoid, eth- moid, two nasal, two superior maxillary, two lachrymal, and two malar. Attachment of Muscles.—To two pairs: corrugator supercilii, and temporal. Temporal Bone.—The temporal bone is situated at the side and base of the skull, and is divisible into a squamous, mastoid, and petrous portion. The Squamous portion, forming the anterior part of the bone, is thin, translucent, and contains no diploe. Upon its external surface * The external surface of the temporal bone of the left side. 1. The squa- mous portion. 2. The mastoid portion. 3. The extremity of the petrous por- tion. 4. The zygoma. 5. Indicates the tubercle of the zygoma, and at the same time its anterior root turning inwards to form the eminentia artieularis. 6. The superior root of the zygoma, forming the posterior part of the temporal ridge. 7. The middle root of the zygoma, terminating abruptly at the glenoid fissure. 8. The mastoid foramen. 9. The meatus auditorius exteruus, sur- rounded by the processus auditorius. 10. The digastric fossa, situated imme- diately to the inner side of (2) the mastoid process. 11. The styloid process. 12. The vaginal process or tympanic lamina. 13. The glenoid or Glaseriau fissure; the leading line from this number crosses the rough posterior portion of the glenoid fossa. 14. The opening and part of the groove for the Eus- tachian tube.

SESAMOID BONES. 113 and lumbricalis ; fifth toe, fourth dorsal interosseous, abductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis minimi digiti and lumbricalis. Second phalanges; great toe, extensor longus pollicis, and flexor longus poUicis; other toes, one slip of the common tendon of the extensor longus and ex- tensor brevis digitorum, and flexor brevis digitorum. Third pha- langes; two slips of the common tendon of the extensor longus and extensor brevis digitorum, and the flexor longus digitonim. Sesamoid bones.â€”These are small osseous masses, developed in those tendons which exert a certain degree of force upon the surface over which they glide, or where, by continued pressure and friction, the tendon would become a source of irritation to neighbouring parts, as to joints. The best example of a sesamoid bone is the patella, de- veloped in the common tendon of the quadriceps extensor, and resting against the front of the knee-joint. Besides the patella, there are four pairs of sesamoid bones included in the number of pieces which compose the skeleton, two upon the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation of each thumb, and existing in the tendons of insertion of the flexor brevis pollicis, and two upon the corresponding joint in the foot, in the tendons of the muscles inserted into the base of the first phalanx. In addition to these there is often a sesamoid bone upon the meta- carpo-phalangeal joint of the little finger; and upon the correspond- ing joint in the foot, in the tendons inserted into the base of the first phalanx; there is one also in the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle, where it glides through the groove in the cuboid bone; some- times in the tendons, as they vidnd around the inner and outer malleolus ; in the psoas and iliacus, where they glide over the body of the OS pubis : and in the external head of the gastrocnemius. The hones of the tympanum, as they belong to the apparatus of hearing, will be described with the anatomy of the ear. I

645 VESICULA SEMINALES. Fig. 225.* volutions of a single tube, which gives off several irregular csecal branches. It is enclosed in a fibrous membrane, derived from the recto-vesical fascia, and is constricted beneath the isthmus of the prostate gland into a small excretory duct. The vas deferens, somewhat enlarged and sacculated, lies along the inner border of each vesicula, and is in- cluded in its fibrous investment. It communicates with the duct of the vesicula, beneath the isthmus of the prostate, and forms the ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory duct is about three quarters of an inch in length, and running forwards, first between the base of the prostate and the isthmus, and then through the tissue of the veru montanum, opens on the mu- cous membrane of the urethra, by the , side of or within the aperture of the »sinus pocularis. In structure the vesiculse semi- nales are composed of three coats :— external, cellular; middle, fibrous and contractile; and internal or mucous, a thin mucous membrane, presenting a delicate reti- cular marking like that of the gall-bladder, and invested by a squamous epithelium. ■ MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. The organs of generation in the male are, the penis and testes, with their appendages. * The posterior aspect of the male bladder; the serous covering is removed in order to show the muscular coat. 1. The body of the bladder. 2. Its fundus. 3. Its inferior fundus or base. 4. The urachus. 5, 5. The ureters. 6, 6. The vasa deferentia. 7, 7. The vesiculse semiaales. The triangular area, bounded by the vasa deferentia and vesiculse seminales on either side, a dotted line above, and the numeral 3 below, is the space corresponding with the trigonum vesicse. It is this part of the bladder which is pierced, in puncturing the bladder through the rectum. The dotted hue, forming the base of this triangular area, marks the extent of the recto-vesical fold of the peritoneum.

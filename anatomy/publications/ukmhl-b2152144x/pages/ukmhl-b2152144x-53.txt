29 FRONTAL BONE. vein which communicates with the nasal veins. On each side of the vertical ridge are some slight depressions which lodge the glandnlse Pacchioni, and on the orbital plates a number of irregular pits called digital fossce, which correspond with the convolutions of the anterior lobes of the cerebrum. The superior border is thick and strongly serrated, bevelled at the expense of the internal table in the middle, where it rests upon the junction of the two parietal, and at the expense of the external table on each side where it receives the lateral pressure of those bones. Fig. 18* 8 The inferior border is thin, irregular, and squamous, and articu- lates with the sphenoid bone. * The internal surface of the frontal bone; the bone is raised in such a manner as to show the orbito-nasal portion. 1. The grooved ridge for the lodgment of the superior longitudinal sinus and attachment of the falx. 2. The foramen Ciscum. 3. The superior or coronal border of the bone ; the figure is situated near that part which is bevelled at the expense of the internal table. 4. The inferior border of the bone. 5. The orbital plate of the left side. 6. The cellular border of the ethmoidal fissure. The foramen caecum (2) is seen through the ethmoidal fissure. 7. The anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina; the anterior is seen leading into its canal. 8. The nasal spine. 9. The depression within the external angular process (12) for the lachrymal gland. 10. The depression for the pulley of the superior oblique muscle of the eye; immediately to the left of this number is the supra-orbital notch, and to its right the internal angular process. 11. The opening leading into the frontal sinuses ; the leading line crosses the internal angular process. 12. The external angular process. The correspond- ing parts are seen on the other side of the figure.

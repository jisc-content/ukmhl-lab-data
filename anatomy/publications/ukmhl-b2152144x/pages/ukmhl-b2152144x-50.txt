PARIETAL BONE. 26 Parietal Bone.—The parietal bone is situated at the side and vertex of the sknll; it is quadrilateral in form, and divisible into an external and internal surface, four borders and four angles. The superior border is straight, to articulate vdth. its fellow of the opposite side. The inferior border is arched and thin, to articulate with the temporal bone. The anterior border is concave, and the posterior somewhat convex. External Surface.—Crossing the bone in a longitudinal direction from the anterior to the posterior border, is an arched line, the tem- poral ridge, to which the temporal fascia is attached. In the middle of this line, and nearly in the centre of the bone, is the projection called the parietal eminence, which marks the centre of ossification. Above the temporal ridge the surface is rough, and covered by the aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis; below the ridge the bone is smooth {planum semicirculare), for the attachment of the fleshy fibres of the temporal muscle. Near the superior border of the bone, and at about one-third from its posterior extremity, is the parietal fora- men, which transmits a vein to the superior longitudinal sinus. This foramen is often absent. Fig. 16.* Internal Surface.—The internal table is smooth ; it is marked by numerous furrows, which lodge the ramifications of the arteria * The internal surface of the left parietal hone. 1. The superior or sagittal border. 2. The inferior, or squamous border. 3. Tixe anterior, or coronal border. 4. The posterior, or lambdoidal border. 5. Part of the groove for the superior longitudinal sinus. 6. The internal termination of the parietal foramen. 7. The anterior inferior angle of the bone, on which is seen the groove for the trunk of the arteria meuingea media. 8. The posterior inferior angle, upon which is seen a jportion of the groove for the lateral sinus.

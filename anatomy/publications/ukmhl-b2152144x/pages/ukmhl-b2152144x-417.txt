393 MEDIAN CEPHALIC AND BASILIC VEINS. jugular and this vein, wliich gives it the appearance of being derived directly from the headâ€”hence its appellation. The Median vein is intermediate in position between the anterior ulnar and radial vein; it begins at the wrist by the junction of branches from- the palm of the hand, and col- lects the blood from the anterior aspect of the forearm, communicat- ing with the two preceding. At the bend of the elbow it receives a branch from the deep veins, and di- vides into two branches, the median cephalic and median basilic. The Median cephalic vein, longer and somewhat smaller than the me- dian basilic, passes obliquely out- wards, in the groove between the biceps and supinator longus, to unite with the radial and form the cephalic vein. The branches of the external cutaneous nerve pass behind it. The Median basilic vein, larger than the median cephalic, passes ob- liquely inwards, in the groove be- tween the biceps and pronator radii teres, and unites with the common trunk of the ulnar veins to form the basilic vein. This vein is crossed by one or two filaments of the internal j cutaneous nerve, and overlies the brachial artery from which it is se- parated by the aponeurotic slip given off from the tendon of the biceps. * Veins of the forearm and bend of the elbow, 1.

External cutaneous nerve, piercing the deep fascia, and dividing into two branches, which pass behind the median cephaUc vein. 15. Internal cutaneous nerve, dividing into branches, which pass in front of the median basilic vein. 16. Intercosto-humeral nerve. 17. Spiral cutaneous nerve, a branch of the musculo-spiral.

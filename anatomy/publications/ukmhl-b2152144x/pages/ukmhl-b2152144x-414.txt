390 VEINS OF THE NECK. cavernous sinus receives the cerebral veins of tlie under part of the anterior lobe, a vein from the posterior border of the orbit (sinus splieno-parietalis) and the vein of the middle fossa of the cranium. The cavernous sinuses communicate by means of the ophthalmic with the facial veins, by the circular sinus with each other, and by the superior petrosal with the lateral sinuses. The Inferior petrosal sinuses are the continuations of the cavern- ous sinuses backwards along the lower border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone at each side of the base of the skull, to the foramina lacera posteriora, where they terminate with the lateral sinuses in the commencement of the internal jugular veins. The Circular sinus (sinus of Eidley; ellipticus) is situated in the sella turcica, surrounding the pituitary gland, and communicating on each side with the cavernous sinus. The posterior segment is larger than the anterior. The Su/perior petrosal sinuses pass obliquely backwards along the attached border of the tentorium, on the upper margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and establish a communication between the cavernous and lateral sinus at each side. They receive one or two cerebral veins from the inferior part of the middle lobes, and a cerebellar vein from the anterior border of the cerebellum. Near the extremity of the petrous bone these sinuses cross the oval aperture which transmits the fifth nerve. Hhe Transverse sinus (basilaris; occipitalis anterior) passes trans- versely across the basilar process of the occipital bone, forming a communication between the two inferior petrosal sinuses. Some- times there are two sinuses in this situation, or, more properly, a plexus. The veins of the neck which return the blood from the head are theâ€” The External jugular vein, the continuation of the superficial division of the tempore-maxillary, augmented by the junction of the posterior auricular, and sometimes of the occipital, commences at the lower border of the parotid gland, in front of the sterno-mastoid muscle. It descends the neck in the direction of a line drawn from the angle of the lower jaw to the middle of the clavicle, crosses the sterno-mastoid, and terminates, near the posterior and inferior attachment of that muscle, in the subclavian vein. In its course downwards it lies upon the anterior lamella of the deep cervical fascia, which separates it from the stemo-mastoid muscle, and is covered in by the platysma myoides and superficial fascia; at the VEINS OF THE NECK.

PELVIC FASCIA. 296 pelvis as low as the pubic arch in front, and the spine of the ischium behind, it divides, in the direction of a line drawn between those points, into two layers, internal and external. The internal layer (recto-vesical) is continued downwards to the prostate gland, Fig. 130.* neck of the bladder, (vagina), and rectum, to which it is closely attached ; and is reflected for a short distance upwards and down- wards on those viscera. This layer is in contact, by its external surface, with the levator ani muscle and coccygeus; and is pro- longed backwards over the sacral nerves to the lower part of the sacrum and the coccyx, to which it is attached, meeting at the middle line the layer of the opposite side. The external layer is the obturator fascia^ it covers in the obturator muscle, and is attached to the ramus of the pubes and ischium in front, and to the tube- rosity of the ischium and falciform border of the great sacro- ischiatic ligament below. The levator ani arises from the line of division of the two preceding layers. The anterior border of the pelvic fascia is separated from its fellow * Transverse section of the pelvis, showing the distribution of the pelvic fascia. 1. Bladder. 2. Vesicula seminalis of one side, divided. 3. Kectum. 4. Iliac fascia, covering in the Uiaeus and psoas (5); and forming a sheath for the external iliac vessels (6). 7. The-anterior crural nerve excluded from the sheath. 8. The pelvic fascia. 9. Its ascending layer, forming the lateral ligament of the bladder of one side, and a sheath to the vesical plexus of veins. 10. A layer of fascia passing betvreen the bladder and rectum. 11. A layer passing around the rectum. 12. Levator ani muscle. 13. Obturator internus, covered in by the obturator fascia, vrhich also forms a sheath for the internal pudic vessels and nerve (14). 15. Perineal fascia investing the under surface of the levator ani. Figure 14 is placed in the ischio-rectal fossa.

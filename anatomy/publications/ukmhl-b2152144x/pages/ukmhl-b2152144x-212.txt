188 MUSCLES OP THE NECK. On raising the platysma throughout its whole extent, the stemo- mastoid is brought into view. The Sterno-cleido-mastoideus is the large ohlique muscle of the neck, and is situated between two layers of the deep cervical fascia. It arises, as implied by its name, from the sternum and clavicle (KXeidiov), and passes obliquely upwards and backwards to be inserted into the mastoid process of the temporal, and into the superior curved line of the occipital bone. The sternal portion arises by a rounded tendon, increases in breadth as it ascends, and spreads out to a considerable extent at its insertion. The clavicular portion is broad and fleshy, and separate from the sternal portion below, ^ but becomes gradually blended with the posterior surface of the latter as it ascends. Fig. 103.* * Muscles of the anterior aspect of the neck; on the right side of the figure the superficial muscles are seen, on the left the deep. 1. Posterior belly of the digastricus. 2. Its anterior belly. The aponeurotic pulley, through which its tendon is seen passing, is attached to the body of the os hyoides 3. 4. The stylo-hyoideus muscle, transfixed by the posterior beUy of the digas- tricus. 5. Mylo-hyoideus. 6. G-enio-hyoideus. 7. The tongue. 8. Hyo- glossus. 9. Stylo-glossus. 10. Stylo-pharyngeus. 11. Sterno-mastoid. 12. Its sternal origin. 13. Its clavicular origin. 14. Sterno-hyoid. 15. Sterno- thyroid of the right side. 16. Thyro-hyoid. 17. Hyoid portion of the omo- hyoid. 18,18. Its scapular portion; on the left side, the tendon of the muscle is seen to be bound down by a portion of the deep cervical fascia. 19. Cla- vicular portion of the trapezius. 20. Scalenus anticus, of the right side. 21. Scalenus posticus; the scalenus medius is seen between the two.

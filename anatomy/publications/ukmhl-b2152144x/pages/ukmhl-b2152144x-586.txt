SUDORIFEROUS DUCTS, 562 skin where the papillae are irregularly distributed, the efferent ducts of the sudoriparous glands open on the surface also irregularly, while on the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet, the pores are situated at regular distances along the ridges, at points corre- sponding with the intervals of the small, square-shaped, clumps of papillEe. Indeed the apertures of the pores, seen upon the surface of the epidermal ridges, give rise to the appearance of small trans- verse furrows, which intersect the ridges from point to point. The efferent duct and the component sacs and tubuli of the sudori- parous gland are lined by an inflection of the epiderma. This inflec- tion is thick and infundibuliform in the upper stratum of the derma, but soon becomes uniform and soft. The infundibuliform projection is drawn out from the duct when the epiderma is removed, and may be perceived on the under surface of the latter as a nipple-shaped cone. A good view of the sudoriferous ducts is obtained by gently separating the epiderma of a portion of decomposing skin; or they may be better seen by scalding a piece of skin, and then withdrawing the epiderma from the derma. In both cases it is the lining sheath of epiderma which is drawn out from the duct.

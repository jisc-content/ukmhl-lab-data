FACIAL NERVE, 472 They have a plexiform commumcation with the inferior dental nerve beneath the depressor anguli oris. The Infra-maxillary branches (subcntanei colli) take their course below the lower jaw, pierce the deep cervical fascia, and are dis- tributed to the platysma. They communicate with the superficialis colli nerve. Fig. 169.* * Distribution of the facial nerve and branches of the cervical plexus. 1. Facial nerve, escaping from the stylo-mastoid foramen, and crossing the ramus of the lower jaw; the parotid gland has been removed in order to see the nerve distinctly. 2. Posterior auricular branch; the digastric and stylo- hyoid twigs are seen near the origin of this branch. 3. Temporal branches, communicating with (4) branches of the supra-orbital nerve. 5. Infra-orbital branches, communicating with (6) the infra-orbital nerve. 7. Supra-max- illary branches, communicating with (8) the mental nerve. 9. Infra-maxiUary branches communicating with (10) the superficialis coUi nerve, and forming a plexus (11) over the submaxillary gland. The distribution of the branches of the facial in a radiated direction over the side of the face and their looped conmumications constitute the pes anserinus. 12. Auricularis magnus nerve, one of the ascending branches of the cervical plexus. 13. Occipitahs minor ascending along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle. 14. Super- ficial and deep descending branches of the cervical plexus. 15. Spinal ac- cessory nerve, giving off a branch to the external surface of the trapezius muscle. 16. Occipitalis major nerve, the posterior branch of the second cervical nerve.

NASAL NERVE. 463 nerve destined for the ophthalmic, and appears to arise by two roots. The Nasal nerve (naso-ciliaris) enters the orbit between the two heads of the external rectus and between the two branches of the third nerve. It crosses the optic nerve in company with the oph- Fig. 167. * A diagram showing the fifth pair of nerves with its branches. 1. Origin of the nerve by two roots. 2. Tlie nerve escaping from the crus cerebelli. 3. Casserian ganglion. 4. Ophthahnic nerve. 5. Frontal nerve giving off the supra-trochlear branch, and escaping on the forehead through the supra- orbital foramen. 6. Lachrymal nerve. 7. Nasal nerve, passing at 8 through the anterior ethmoidal foramen, and giving off the infra-trochlear branch. 9. Communication (superior root) of the nasal nerve with the ophthalmic ganglion. 10. A small portion of the third nerve with which the gangUon is seen communicating (inferior root); the ganghon gives off the ciliary nerves from its anterior aspect. 11. Superior maxillary nerve. 12. Orbital branch. 13. Spheno-palatine nerves communicating with Meckel's ganghon; the three branches given off from the lower part of the ganghon are the palatine nerves. 14, 14. Superior dental nerves, posterior, middle, and anterior, forming by their communications the superior maxillary plexus. 15. Infra-orbital branches distributed to the cheek. 16. Inferior maxillary nerve. 17. Its anterior or muscular trunk. 18. The posterior trunk; the two divisions are separated by an arrow. 19. Gustatory nerve. 20. The chorda tympani joining it at an acute angle. 21. Submaxillary ganglion. 22. Inferior dental nerve. 23. Mylo-hyoidean branch. 24. Auriculo-temporal nerve, dividing behind the articulation of the lower jaw, to reunite and form a single trunk. 25. Its branch of communication with the facial nerve. 26. Continuation of its trunk to the teinple.

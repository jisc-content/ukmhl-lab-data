149 CARPO-METACARPAL ARTICULATIONS. Carpo-metacarpal Articulations.â€”The second row of bones of the carpus articulates with the metacarpal bones of the four fingers by dorsal and palmar ligaments ; and the metacarpal bone of the thumb with the trapezium by a true capsular ligament. There is also in the carpo-metacarpal articulation a thin interosseous band, which passes from the ulnar edge of the os magmim to the bases of the third and fourth metacarpal bones at their point of connexion. The dorsal ligaments are strong fasciculi which pass from the second range of carpal to the metacarpal bones ; with the exception of the little finger there are two fasciculi to each bone, namely, to the index finger, one each from the trapezium and trapezoides ; to the middle finger, one each from the trapezoides and os magnum ; to the ring finger, one each from the os magnum and unciforme ; and to the little finger, one from the unciforme. * A diagram showing the disposition of the five synovial membranes of the wrist joint. 1.

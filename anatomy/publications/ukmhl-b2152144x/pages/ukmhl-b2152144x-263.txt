Dissection.â€”Make an incision along the line of the clavicle, from the upper part of the sternum to the acromion process; a second along the lower border of the great pectoral muscle, from the lower end of the sternum to the insertion of its tendon into the humerus; and connect the two by a third, carried longitudinally along the middle of the sternum. The integument and superficial fascia are to be dissected together from off the fibres of the muscle, and always in the direction of their course. For this purpose the dissector, if he have the right arm, will commence with the lower angle of the flap; if the left, with the upper angle. He will thus expose the pectoralis major muscle in its whole extent. Pectoralis major, Pectoralis minor, Subclavius. The Pectoralis major (sterno-humeralis) arises from the sternal half of the clavicle, from half the sternum its whole length, from the cartilages of all the true ribs, excepting the first and last, and from the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. From this extensive origin the fibres converge to be inserted by a broad tendon into the anterior bicipital ridge of the humerus. The pectoralis major admits of a division into three portions,

FEMORAL ARTERY. 367 Fig. 146* is continiiOTis with the trans- versalis and Uiac fascia. If the sheath he opened at this point, the artery will be seen to be situated in con- tact with the onter wall of the sheath. The vein lies next the artery, being se- parated from it by a fibrous septum, and between the vein and the inner wall of the sheath, and divided from the vein by another thin fibrous septum, is a trian- gular interval {femoral or crural canal), into which the sac is protruded in fe- moral hernia. This space is occupied in the normal state of the parts by loose cellular tissue, and by lymphatic vessels which pierce the inner wall of the sheath * Anterior and inner aspect of the thigh, with the femoral ar- tery. 1. Lower part of the ten- don of the external oblique muscle; its inferior margin is Poupart's ligament, 2. Exter- nal abdominal ring. 3,3. Upper and lower part of the sartorius muscle; its middle portion hav- ing been removed. 4. Rectus. 5, Vastus internus. 6. PateUa. 7. Ihacus and psoas; the latter being nearest the artery. 8. Pec- tineus. 9. Adductor longus. 10. The tendinous canal for the femoral artery formed by the adductor magnus, and vas- tus internus. 11. Adductor magnus. 12. Gracilis. 13. Ten- don of the semi-tendinosus. 14. Femoral artery. 15. Superficial circumflexa iUi artery, taking its course along the line of Poupart's ligament, to the crest of the ihum. 2. Superficial epigastric artery. 16. The two external pudic arteries, superior and inferior. 17. The profunda artery, giving off, 18, its external circumflex branch; and lower down the three perforantes. A small bend of the internal circumflex artery (8) is seen behind the inner margin of the femoral, just below the inferior external pudic artery. 19. The anastomotica magna, descending to the knee, upon which it ramifies (6).

306 PLANTAE FASCIA. ternal and external annular ligaments ; and on the mesial side with the central portion. The inner portion is continuous along the border of the foot with the fascia of the dorsum; the outer is attached to the os calcis and base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, forming between these points a thick band, which gives origin to a part of the abductor minimi digiti muscle. Besides constituting a strong layer of investment and defence to the soft parts situated in the sole of the foot, these three portions of fascia send processes inwards, which form sheaths for the different muscles. A strong septum is given ofiT from each side of the middle portion of the plantar fescia, which is attached to the tarsal bones, and divides the muscles into three groiips, a middle and two lateral; and transverse septa are stretched between these to separate the layers. The superficial layer of muscles derive a part of their origin from the plantar fascia.

SPHINCTER ANI, 236 The Sphincter ani is a thin and elliptical plane of muscle closely- adherent to the integument, and surrounding the opening of the anus. It a/rises posteriorly in the superficial fascia around the coccyx, and by a fibrous raphe from the apex of that bone; and is inserted anteriorly into the tendinous centre of the perineum, and into the raphe of the integument, nearly as far forward as the commence- ment of the scrotum. M</. 113.* Relations.—By its superficial mrface with the integument. By its deep swrface with the internal sphincter, levator ani, cellular tissue and fat of the ischio-rectal fossa, and in front with the super- ficial perineal fascia. The Sphincter ani internus is a muscular band embracing th« extremity of the intestine, and formed by an aggregation of the cir- cular muscular fibres of the rectum. Part of the levator ani may be seen during the dissection of the^ anal portion of the perineum by removing the &t which surrounds the termination of the rectum in the ischio-rectal fossa. But, to study the entire muscle, a lateral section of the pelvis must be made * Muscles of the perineum. 1. Aeceleratores urinae; the figure rests on the corpus spongiosum penis. 2. Corpus cavernosum of one side. 3. Erector penis of one side. 4. Transversus periuei of one side. 5. The triangular space through which the triangular hgament is seen. 6. Sphincter anij its anterior extremity cut off. 7. Levator ani of the left side; the deep space between the tuberosity of the ischium (8) and the anus, is the ischio-rectal fossa; the same fossa is seen on the opposite side. 9. Spine of the ischium. 10. Left coccygeus muscle. The boundaries of the perineum are well seen in this engraving.

POSTERIOR FEMORAL REGION. 274 Relations.—By its superficial or posterior surface with the gluteus maximus and fascia lata. By its deep or anterior surface Mg. 123.* with the semi-membranosus, ad- ductor magnus, vastus externus, great sciatic nerve, popliteal artery and vein, and near its insertion with the external head of the gas- trocnemius, and plantaris. By its in/ner border with the semi-tendi- nosus, and in the popliteal space with the popliteal artery and vein. The Semi-tendinosus, remark- able for its long tendon, arises in common with the long head of the biceps, from the upper and back part of the tuberosity of the is- chium : the two muscles being closely united for several inches below their origia. It is inserted into the inner tuberosity of the tibia, immediately below the in- sertion of the tendon of the gracilis, and sends an expansion to the fascia of the leg. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the gluteus maximus, fascia lata, and at its insertion with the synovial bursa which separates its tendon from the expansion of the sartorius. By its deep surface with the semi-membranosus, ad- ductor magnus, internal head of the gastrocnemius, and internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint, the sy- novial bursa common to it and the tendon of the gracilis being inter- posed. By its inner border with the gracilis; and by its outer border with the biceps. These two muscles must be dis- * Muscles of the posterior femoral and gluteal region. 1. Gluteus medius. 2. Gluteus maximus. 3. The vastus externus covered in by fascia lata. 4. The long head of the biceps. 5. Its short head. 6. Semi-tendinosus. 7, 7. Semi- membranosus. 8. Gracilis. 9. Part of the inner border of the adductor magnus. 10. The edge of the sartorius. 11. The pophteal space. 12. Gas- trocnemius muscle; its two heads. The tendon of the biceps forms the outer hamstring; the sartorius with the tendons of the gracilis, semi-tendinosus, and semi-membranosus, the inner hamstring.

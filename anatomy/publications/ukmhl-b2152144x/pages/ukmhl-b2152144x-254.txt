MUSCLES OP THE ABDOMEN. 230 first lumbar vertebra, ligamenta arcuata and last. rib. The internal pillars approach each other as they ascend, the arched interval between them being the aortic opening; their internal fibres con- sisting of several fasciculi cross each other in front of the aortic opening and form the lateral boundaries of another opening of ellip- * Under or abdominal side of the diaphragm. 1, 2, 3. The greater muscle; figure 1 rests on the central leaflet of the tendinous centre; number 2 on the left or smallest leaflet; number 3 on the right leaflet. 4. The fasciculus which arises from the ensiform cartilage; a small triangular space, which is closed only by the serous membranes of the abdomen and chest, is left on either side of this fasciculus. 5. Ligamentum arcuatum externum of the left side. 6. Ligamentum arcuatum internum. 7. A small arched opening occasionally found, through which the lesser splanchnic nerve passes. 8. The right or larger tendon of the lesser muscle; a muscular fasciculus from this tendon curves to the left side of the greater muscle between the oesophageal and aortic opening. 9. Fourth lumbar vertebra. 10. The left or shorter tendon of the lesser muscle. 11. The aortic opening occupied by the aorta, which is cut short off". 12. A portion of the oesophagus issuing through the oesophageal opening; in this figure the oesophageal opening is tendinous at its anterior part, a state that is not uncommon. 13. Opening for the inferior vena cava, in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm. 14. Psoas magnus passing beneath the hgamenttmi arcuatum internum; it has been removed on the opposite side to show the arch more distinctly. 15. The quadratus lumborum passing be- neath the hgamentum arcuatum externum; this muscle has also been removed on the left side.

POSTERIOR BRACHIAL REGION. 256 from the interosseous membrane and radius, and passes through the same groove with the extensor ossis metacarpi, to be inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—The same as those of the preceding muscle, with the exception of the extensor carpi ul- naris. The muscle accompanies the extensor ossis metacarpi. The Extensor sbcundi internodii POLLicis (extensor pollicis longus vel major) arises from the ulna, and in- terosseous membrane. Its tendon passes through a distinct groove in the radius, and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—By its external surface with the same relations as the ex- tensor ossis metacarpi. By its deep surface with the ulna, interosseous membrane, radius, wrist-joint, radial artery, and metacarpal bone of the thumb. The muscle is placed between the extensor primi internodii and ex- tensor indicis. The Extensor indicis (indicator) arises from the ulna, as high up as the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, and inferiorly from the interosseous membrane. Its tendon passes be- neath the annular ligament to be inserted into the aponeurosis formed by the common extensor tendon of the index finger. Relations.—The same as those of the preceding muscle, with the excep- tion of the hand, where the tendon rests upon the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger and second interosseous muscle, and has no relation with the radial artery. The tendons of the extensors, as of the flexor muscles of the forearm, are provided with synovial bursa as they * Deep layer of muscles of the posterior aspect of the forearm. 1. The humerus. 2. Olecranon. 3. Ulna. 4. Anconeus. 5. Supinator brevis. 6. Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. 7. Extensor primi internodii poUicis. 8. Extensor secundi internodii pollicis. 9. Extensor indicis. 10. First dorsal interosseous muscle. The other three dorsal interossei are seen between the metacarpal bones of their respective fingers.

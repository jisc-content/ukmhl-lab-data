INTERNAL PUDIC ARTEBY. 362 pelvis are several small ramuscules to the levator ani and sacral nerves; and occasionally a branch which takes the place of the inferior vesical or middle haemorrhoidal artery. The branches given off externally to the pelvis, are the— Inferior hsemorrhoidal, Arteria corporis bulbosi, Superficialis perinei, Arteria corporis cavernosi, Transversa perinei, Arteria dorsalis penis. The Inferior hcemorrhoidal arteries (extemse) are three or four small branches, given off by the internal pudic while behind the tuberosity of the ischium. They cross the ischio-rectal fossa, and Fig. 145.* * Arteries of the perineum; on the right side the superficial arteries are seen, on the left the deep. 1. The penis; the cms penis on the left side is cut through. 2. Acceleratores urinae muscles, enclosing the bulbous por- tion of the corpus spongiosum. 3. Erector penis, spread out upon the crus penis of the right side. 4. The anus, surrounded by the sphincter ani muscle. 5. Kamus of the ischium and pubes. 6. Tuberosity of the ischium. 7. Lesser sa«ro-ischiatic ligament, attached by its small extremity to the spine of the ischium. 8. Coccyx. 9. The internal pudic artery, crossing the spine of the ischium, and entering the perineum. 10. Inferior haemorrhoidal branches. 11. Superficiahs perinei artery, giTing olf a small branch, transversa perinei, upon the transversus perinei muscle. 12. The same artery on the left sidp cut off. 13. Artery of the bulb. 14. The two terminal branches of the internal pudic artery; one is seen entering the divided extremity of the crus penis, the artery of the corpus cavernosum; the other, the dorsalis penis, ascends to the dorsum of the organ.

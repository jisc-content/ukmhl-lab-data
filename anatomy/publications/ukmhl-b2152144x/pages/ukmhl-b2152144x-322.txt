298 PERINEAL FASCIA. The superficial fascia consists as in other situations of two layers, one lying next the skin and containing an abundance of fat, the other more condensed lying in contact with the muscles. The superficial layer in the perineum is connected with the raphe at the middle line and with the external border of the superficial sphincter, and is continuous by its circumference with the dartos of the scrotum or cellular tissue of the labia majora in front, with the superficial fascia of the thighs on each side, and with the superficial fascia covering the glutei maximi and coccyx behind. The deep layer or proper perineal fascia (fascia perinei superfi- cialis) is divisible into two portions, anterior and posterior, the former investing the muscles of the perineum, the other the ischio-rectal fossa. The anterior portion (fascia ischio-pubica, Velpeau) is a thin aponeurotic layer which covers in the muscles of the genital region of the perineum and root of the penis. It is firmly attached at each side to the ramus of the pubes and ischium; posteriorly it is re- Fig. 132.* * The pubic arch and perineal fasciae. 1, 1, 1. The superficial perineal fascia divided by a ^ shaped incision into three flaps; the lateral flaps are turned over the ramus of the pubes and ischium at each side, to which they are firmly attached; the posterior flap is continuous with the deep perineal fascia or triangular hgament. 2.

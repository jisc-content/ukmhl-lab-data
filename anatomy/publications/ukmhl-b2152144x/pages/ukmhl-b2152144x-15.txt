PREFACE. vii me by the great Scandinavian Professor, it may not be out of place here to put on record an act of liberality, in connexion with this book, from another foreign source, namely, from the well known medical publishers of Philadelphia, Messrs. Blanchard and Lea. The following extract from a letter addressed to me by them, and bearing date April 4, 1854, will explain the incident to which I now refer. " You may perhaps be acquainted with the name of our house as having published in this country your works on Anatomy and Diseases of the Skin. When English works which we issue are successful, it always affords us pleasure to make the Author an acknow- ledgment more substantial, if not more gratifying, than the transatlantic reputation thus obtained; and we accordingly take pleasure in handing you the an- nexed draft, which we trust you will do us the favour to accept." With the above encouraging passages in the annals of the Anatomist's Yade Mecum I now conclude, trust- ing that my reader, and those for whom the book was specially written, may find no reason to utter a judg- ment less favourable than the foreign reputation and wide circulation of the volume would seem to justify. 17, Henrietta Street, Cavendish Square,

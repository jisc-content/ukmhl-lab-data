SPLENIC ARTERY. 352 is distributed to the pancreas and duodenum. It inosculates infe- riorly with the inferior pancreatico-duodenalis and pancreatic branches of the superior mesenteric artery. The Cystic artery, generally a branch of the right hepatic, is of small size, and ramifies between the coats of the gall-bladder, pre- viously to its distribution to the mucous membrane. The Splenic artery (splenica; lienalis), the largest of the three branches of the coeliac axis, passes horizontally to the left along the * Branches of the coeliac axis, 1. Liver. 2. Its transverse fissure. 3. Gall- bladder. 4. Stomach. 5. (Esophagus. 6. Pylorus. 7. Duodenum, de- scending portion. 8. Transverse portion of the duodenum. 9. Pancreas. 10. Spleen. 11. The aorta. 12.

Pancreatico-duodenahs, inosculating with the inferior pancreatico-duodenalis. 19. Division of the hepatic artery into right and left branches; the right giving off' the cystic branch. 20. Splenic artery, traced by dotted lines behind the stomach to the spleen. 21. Gastro-epiploica sinistra, inosculating along the great curvature of the stomach with the gastro- epiploica dextra. 22. Pancreatica magna. 23. Vasa brevia to the great end of the stomach, inosculating with the gastric artery. 24. Superior mesenteric artery, emerging from between the pancreas and transverse portion of the duodenum.

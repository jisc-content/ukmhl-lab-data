STRrCTURE OF CARTILAGE. 118 granular matter. Cartilage cells have an average measnrement of 15^0 (I tb. of an inch in long diameter; they are sometimes isolated, Fig. 61.* Fig. 62.t sometimes gronped in pairs, and sometimes disposed in a linear group of three or four. Near the bone they are larger than at the surface, and in the latter situation are long and slender in form, and arranged in rows having their long axis parallel with the plane of the surface. True cartilage is pearl-white or bluish and opaline in colour, its intercellular substance being semitransparent and struc- tureless. These characters, however, are changed when it exhibits a tendency to ossify; in which case the intercellular substance becomes fibrous and more or less opaque, its colour yellowish, and the cells filled with a greater number of oil-globules than in its natural state. The true cartilages are, the articular, costal, ensiform, thyroid, cricoid, aryten- oid, tracheal, bronchial, nasal, meatus auris, pully of the trochlearis muscle, and temporary cartilage, or the cartilage of bone previously to ossification. ยง Reticular cartilage is composed of cells (15^00^^ 0^ i^^^ ^ * Arrangement of the cells in articular cartilage.

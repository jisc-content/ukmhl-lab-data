445 BASE OF THE BRAIN. The Pituitary gland (hypophysis cerebri) is a small, flattened, reddish-grey body, situated in the sella turcica, and closely retained in that situation by the dura mater and arachnoid. It consists of Fig. 161.* * Under surface or base of the brain. 1. Anterior lobe of one hemisphere of the cerebrum. 2. Middle lobe. 3. Posterior lobe almost concealed by (4) the hemisphere of the cerebellum. 5. Pyramidal lobe of the inferior ver- miform process of the cerebellum. 6. Pneumogastric lobule. 7. Longi- tudinal fissure. 8. Olfactory nerves, with their bulbous exjpansion. 9. The substantia perforata at the inner termination of the fissure of Sylvius; the three roots of the olfactory nerve are seen on the substantia perforata. The commencement of the transverse fissui-e on each side is concealed by the inner border of the middle lobe. 10. Commissure of the optic nerves; the mmieral is placed between the optic nerves as they diverge from the commissure, and rests upon the lamina cinerea of the corpus callosum. 11. Tuber cinereum, from which the infundibulxrm is seen projecting. 12. Corpora albicantia. 13. Locus perforatus, bounded on each side by the crura cerebri, and third nerve. 14. Pons Varolii. 15. Crus cerebehi of one side. 16. Fil'th nerve emerging from the anterior border of the crus cerebeUi; the small nerve by its side is the fourth. 17. Sixth pair of nerves. 18. Seventh pair of nerves, consisting of the auditory and facial. 19. Corpora pyramidalia of the me- dulla oblongata; the corpus ohvare and part of the corpus restiforme are seen at each side. Just below the numeral is the decussation of the fibres of the corpora pyramidaha. 20. Eighth pair of nerves. 21. Ninth or hypoglossal nerve. 22. Anterior root of the first cervical spinal nerve.

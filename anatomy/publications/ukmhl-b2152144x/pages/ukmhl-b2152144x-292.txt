The Sartorius (tailor's muscle) is a long riband-like muscle, ansing from the anterior superior Fig. 122.* spinous process of the ilium, and from the notch immediately below that process ; it crosses obliquely the upper third of the thigh, de- scends behind the inner condyle of the femur, and is inserted by an aponeurotic expansion into the inner tuberosity of the tibia. This ex- pansion covers in the insertion of the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles. The inner border of the sartorius muscle is the guide to the operation for tying the femoral artery in the middle of its course; and the outer boundary of Scarpa's triangular space. Relations. â€” By its superficial surface with the fascia lata and cutaneous nerves. By its rfgej? sur- face with the psoas and iliacus, rec- tus, sheath of the femoral vessels, vastus internus, adductor longus, adductor magnus, gracilis, long saphenous nerve, internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint. By its expanded insertion mth the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus, a synovial bursa being interposed. At the knee-joint its posterior border is in relation with the in- ternal saphenous vein. At the upper third of the thigh the sar- torius forms, with the lower border of the adductor longus, an isosceles triangle (Scarpa's triangular space), whereof the base corresponds with Poupart's ligament.

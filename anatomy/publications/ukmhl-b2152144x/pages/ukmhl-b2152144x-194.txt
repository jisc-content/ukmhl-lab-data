170 MUSCLES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. tary in its action is composed of ultimate fibres, having tke trans- verse striae of tlie muscle of animal life. The muscles may be arranged in conformity with the general divi- sion of the body into—1. Those of the head and neck. 2. Those of the trunk. 3. Those of the upper extremity. 4. Those of the lower extremity. MUSCLES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. The muscles of the head and neck admit of subdivision into those of the head and face, and those of the neck. Muscles of the Head and Face.—These muscles may be divided into groups corresponding with the natural regions of the head and face; the groups are eight in number, namely, 1. Cranial group. 5. Superior labial group. 2. Orbital group, 6. Inferior labial group. 3. Ocular group. 7. Maxillary group, 4. Nasal group, 8. Auricular group. The muscles of each of these groups may be thus arranged— 1. Cranial group. Occipito-frontalis. 2. Orhital group. Orbicularis palpebrarum, Corrugator supercilii, Tensor tarsi. 3. Ocular group. Levator palpebrse, Rectus superior. Rectus inferior, Rectus internus, Rectus externus, Obliquus superior, Obliquus inferior. 4. Nasal group. Pyramidalis nasi, Compressor naris, Dilatator naris, Depressor alse nasj. 5. Superior labial group. (Orbicularis oris). Levator labii superioris alseque nasi, Levator labii superioris proprius, Levator anguli oris, Zygomaticus major, Zygomaticus minor. 6. Inferior lahial group. (Orbicularis oris),* Depressor labii inferioris, Depressor anguli oris, Risorius Santorini, Levator labii inferioris. 7. Maxillary group. Masseter, Temporalis, Buccinator, Pterygoideus externus, Pterygoideus internus. 8. Auricular group. Attollens aurem, Attrahens aurem, Retrahens aurem. * The orbicularis oris, from encircling the mouth, belongs necessarily to both the superior and inferior labial regions; it is therefore enclosed within parentheses in both.

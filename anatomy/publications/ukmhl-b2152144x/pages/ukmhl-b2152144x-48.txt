24 OCCIPITAL BONE. two, and is called the jugular eminence. Into tlie jugular fossa will be seen opening the posterior condyloid foramen. The superior borders are very much serrated, and assist in forming the lamhdoidal suture; the inferior are rough, hut not serrated, and articulate with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone by means of the additamentum suturse lambdoidalis. The jugular eminence and side of the basilar process articulate with the petrous portion of the Fig. 14.* temporal bone, and the intermediate space, which is irregularly notched, forms the posterior boundary of the jugular foramen, or foramen lacerum posterius. The angles of the occipital bone are the superior, inferior, and two lateral. The superior angle is received into the interval formed by the union of the posterior and superior angles of the parietal bones, and corresponds with that portion of the foetal head which is called * The internal surface of the occipital bone. 1.

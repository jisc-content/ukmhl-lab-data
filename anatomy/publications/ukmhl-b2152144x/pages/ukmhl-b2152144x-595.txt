571 LEFT AURICLE.—LEFT VENTRICLE. The Pulmonary veins, two from the right and two from the left lung, open into the corresponding sides of the auricle. The two left pulmonary veins terminate frequently by a common opening. The Auriculo-ventricular opening is the aperture of communi- cation between the auricle and ventricle. The Musculi pectinati are fewer in number than in the right auricle, and are situated only in the appendix auriculae. Left Ventricle.—The left ventricle is to be opened by making an incision a little to the left of the septum ventriculorum, and con- tinuing it around the apex of the heart to the auriculo-ventricular opening behind. The left ventricle is conical, both in external figure and in the Fig. 195.* * Anatomy of the heart; the organ is viewed on its left side. 1, CaTity of the left auricle. The number is placed on that portion of the septum auri- cularum corresponding with the centre of the fossa ovalis. 2. Cavity of the appendix auriciilae, near the apex of which are seen musculi pectinati. 3. Opening of the two right pulmonary veins. 4. The sinus, into which the left pulmonary veins open. 5. Left ptilmonary veins. 6. Auriculo- ventricular opening. 7. Coronary vein, lying in the auriculo-ventricular groove. 8. Left ventricle. 9, 9.

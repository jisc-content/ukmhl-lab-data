BASE OF THE SKULL. 62 palatine foramina, for the palatine nerves and arteries. Passings inwards from these foramina are the transverse ridges, to which ar^ attached the aponeurotic expansions of the tensor palati muscles and at the middle line of the posterior border, the palate spine, which gives origin to the azygos uvulse. The hard palate is marked by a crucial suture, which distinguishes the four processes of which it is composed. Behind, and above the hard palate, are the pos- * The external or basilar surface of the base of the skull. 1, 1. The hard palate. The figures are placed on the palate processes of the superior max- fllary bones. 2. The incisive, or anterior palatine foramen. 3. The palate process of the palate bone. The large opening near the figure is the posterior palatine foramen. 4. The palate spine; the curved Hne upon which the number rests is the transverse ridge. 5. The vomer, dividing the openings of the posterior nares. 6. The internal pterygoid plate. 7. The scaphoid fossa. 8. The external pterygoid plate. The interval between 6 and 8 (right side of the figure) is the pterygoid fossa. 9. The zygomatic fossa. 10. The basilar process of the occipital bone. 11. The foramen magnum. 12. The foramen ovale. 13. The foramen spinosum. 14. The glenoid fossa. 15. The meatus auditorius externus. 16. The foramen lacerum anterius basis crami. 17. The carotid foramen of the left side. 18. The foramen lacerum posterius, or jugular foramen. 19. The styloid process. 20. The stylo-mastoid foramen. The elevation just to the right of the figure is the jugmar tubercle ; and the groove to its left the digastric fossa. 21. The mastoid process. 22. One of the condyles of the occipital bone. 23. The posterior condyloid fossa.

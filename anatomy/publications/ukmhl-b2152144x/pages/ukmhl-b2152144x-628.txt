604 SMALL INTESTINES. twelve fingers (eiglit or ten inches). In its course it presents a horse-shoe curve; commencing at the pylorus, it ascends obliquely backwards to the under surface of the liver; it next descends per- pendicularly in front of the right kidney as low as the fourth lum- bar vertebra, and then passes nearly transversely across the third lumbar vertebra; terminating in the jejunum on the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, where it is crossed by the superior mesen- teric artery and vein. It is connected with the portal eminence of the liver by means of a band of peritoneum called ligamentum hepatico-duodenale: and to the right kidney by another band, the ligamentum duodeno-renale. The first or oblique portion (pars transversa superior) of its course, between two and three inches in length, is completely enclosed by Fig. 204.* * Vertical and longitudinal section of the stomach and duodenum, made in such, a direction as to include the two orifices of the stomach. 1. (Esophagus; upon its internal surface the plicated arrangement of the mucous membrane is shown. 2. Cardiac orifice of the stomach, around which the serrated border of the epithelium is seen. 3. Grreat end of the stomach. 4. Lesser or pyloric end. 5. Lesser curve. 6. Greater curve. 7. DUatation at the lesser end of the stomach, the antrum of the pylorus. This may be regarded as the rudiment of a second stomach. 8. Kugse of the stomach formed by the mucous mem- brane : their longitudinal direction is shown. 9. Pylorus. 10. Oblique por- tion of the duodenum. 11. Descending portion. 12. Pancreatic duct and ductus communis choledochus close to their termination. 13. PapiUa upon which the ducts open. 14. Transverse portion of the duodenum. 15. Commencement of the jejunum. In the interior of the duodenum and jejunum, the valvulge conniventes are seen. ^

PNEUMOGASTKIC NERVE. 478 nicate with the hepatic plexus in the lesser omentum ; those of the posterior aspect are derived from the right nerve and communicate with the solar plexus. Fig. 171* * Anatomy of the side of the neck, showing the nerves of the tongue. 1. Fragment of the temporal bone containing the meatus auditorius externus, mastoid, and styloid process. 2. Stylo-hyoid muscle. 3. Stylo-glossus. 4. Stylo-pharyngeus. 5. Tongue. 6, 18. Hyo-glossus muscle; its two por- tions. 7. G-enio-hyo-glossus. 8. Genio-hyoideus; both arise from the inner surface of the symphysis of the lower jaw. 9. Sterno-hyoid muscle. 10. Sterno-thyroid. 11. Thyro-hyoid, upon which the thyro-hyoidean branch of the hypoglossal nerve is seen ramifying. 12. Omo-hyoid crossing the common carotid artery (13), and internal jugular vein (14). 15. External carotid giving off its branches. 16. Internal carotid. 17. Gustatory nerve giving a branch to the submaxillary ganglion (18), and communicating a little farther on vnth the hypoglossal nerve. 19. Submaxillary, or Wharton's duct, passing forwards to the subhngual gland. The submaxillary ganglion is the small round body between numbers 18 and 19. 20. Glosso-pharyngeal nerve, passing in behind the hyo-glossus muscle. 21. Hypoglossal nerve curving around the occipital artery. 22. Descendens noni nerve, forming a loop veith (23) the eommunicans noni, which is seen to be arising by filaments from the upper cervical nerves. 24. Pneumogastric nerve, emerging from between the internal jugular vein and common carotid artery, and entering the chest. 25. Facial nerve, emerging from the stylo-mastoid foramen, and crossing the external carotid artery.

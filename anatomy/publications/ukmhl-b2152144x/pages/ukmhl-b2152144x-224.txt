The Palato-glossus (constrictor isthmi faucium) is a small fasci- culus of fibres, which arises in the soft palate as a radiated expansion. from the raphe of the soft palate, where its fibres are continuous with those of the muscle of the opposite side; and is inserted into the inner surface of the pharynx and posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. This muscle is broad above where it forms the whole thickness of the lower half of the soft palate, narrow in the posterior pillar, and again broad and thin in the pharynx where it spreads out previously to its insertion. The levator palati passes to its in- sertion between the two fasciculi of origin of this muscle. Relations.â€”In the soft palate it is in relation with the mucous * Muscles of the soft palate. 1.

It is the projection of this small muscle, covered by mucous membrane, that forms the anterior pillar of the soft palate. It has been named constrictor isthmi faucium, from a function it performs in common with the palato- pharyngeus, viz., of con- stricting the opening of the fauces. The Palato-pharyngeus (constrictor isthmi faucium posterior) forms the poste- rior pillar of the fauces; it arises by two fasciculi

THORACIC DUCT. 415 which unite to form the receptaeulum chyli: it next receives the trlinks of the lacteal vessels. Within the thorax it is joined by a large lymphatic trunk from the liver, and in its course through the posterior mediastinum, receives the lymphatic vessels both from the viscera and parietes of the thorax. At its curve forwards in the neck it is joined by lymphatic trunks from the left side of the head and neck, left upper extremity, upper part of the thorax, and thoracic viscera. The Ductus lymphaticus dexter is a short trunk which receives the lymphatic vessels from the right side of the head and neck, right upper extremity, right side of the thorax, right lung, and one or two branches from the liver. It terminates at the junction of the right subclavian with the right internal jugular vein, at the point where these veins unite to form the right vena innominata ; and is provided at its termination with a pair of semilunar valves, which prevent the entrance of blood from the veins.

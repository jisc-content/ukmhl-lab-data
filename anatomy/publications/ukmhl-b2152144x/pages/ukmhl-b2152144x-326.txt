302 FASCIA OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. In addition to tlie smaller openings in tlie fascia lata whicli trans- mit the small cutaneous vessels and nerves, there exists at the upper and inner extremity of the thigh an oval opening (fovea ovalis), which gives passage to the superficial lymphatic vessels, and the large subcutaneous vein of the lower extremity, the internal saphe- nous vein, and is thence named the saphenous opening. The ex- istence of this opening has given rise to the division of the upper part of the fascia lata into two portions, an Uiac portion and a pubic portion. The iliac portion is situated upon the iliac side of the opening. It is attached to the crest of the ilium, and along Poupart's ligament to the spine of the pubes, whence it is reflected downwards and out- wards in an arched direction, and forms a falciform, border, which * Section of the structures which pass beneath the femoral arch. 1. Pou- part's ligament. 2, 2. The ihac portion of the fascia lata, attached along the margin of the crest of the ilium, and along Poupart's ligament, as far as the spine of the pubes (3). 4. The pubic portion of the fascia lata, continuous at 3 with the iliac portion, and passing outwards behind the sheath of the femoral vessels to its outer border at 5, where it divides into two layers; one is continuous with the sheath of the psoas (6), and Uiacus (7); the other (8) is lost upon the capsule of the hip-joint (9). 10. The crural nerve enclosed in the sheath of the psoas and Oiacus. 11, Gimbernat's ligament. 12. The femoral ring, within the femoral sheath. 13. Femoral vein. 14. Femoral artery; the two vessels and the ring are surrounded by the femoral sheath, and thin septa are sent between the anterior and posterior wall of the sheath, dividing the artery from the vein, and the vein from the femoral ring.

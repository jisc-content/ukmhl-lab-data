LATERAL VENTEICLES. 433 vascular processes, which are termed villi. They are invested by a very delicate epithelium, surmounted by cilia, which have been Fig. 158* * Lateral ventricles of tte cerebrum, 1, 1. The two hemispheres cut down to a level with the corpus caUosum so as to constitute the centrum ovale majus. The surface is seen to be studded with the small vascular points, puneta vasculosa; and surrounded by a narrow margin which represents the grey substance. 2. A small portion of the anterior extremity (genu) of the corpus caUosum. 3. Its posterior boundary (splenium); the intermediate portion forming the roof of the lateral ventricles has been removed so as to expose completely those cavities. 4. Part of the septum lucidum, showing an interspace between its layers, the fifth ventricle. 5. Anterior cornu of one side. 6. Commencement of the middle cornu. 7. Posterior cornu. 8. Corpus striatum of one ventricle. 9. Tenia semicircuiaris partly covered by the vena corporis striati. 10. A small part of the thalamus opticus. 11. The dark fringe-Eke body to the left of the numeral is the choroid plexus. This plexus coromunicates with that of the opposite ventricle through the foramen of Monro, or foramen commune anterius; a bristle is passed through this opening (under figure 4), and its extremities are seen resting on the corpus striatum at each side. The figure 11 rests upon the edge of the fornix, on that part of it which is called the corpus fimbriatum. 12. The fornix. 13. Commencement of the hippocampus major descending into the middle cornu. The rounded oblong body, directly behind the figure 13, is the pes accessorius, and farther back, immediately under figure 7, the hippo- campus minor.

387 SINUSES OP THE DURA MATER. The sinuses of the dura mater are irregular channels, formed by the splitting of the layers of that membrane, and liaed upon their inner surface by a continuation of the internal coat of the veins. They may be divided into two groupsâ€”those situated at the upper and back part of the skull, and those of the base of the skull. The former are, the Superior longitudinal sinus, Occipital sinuses. Inferior longitudinal sinus. Lateral sinuses. Straight sinus, The Superior longitudinal drms is situated in the attached margin of the falx cerebri, and extends along the middle line of the arch of the skull, from the foramen caecum in the frontal, to the inner tuberosity of the occipital bone, where it divides into the two lateral sinuses. It is triangular in form, is small in front, and increases gradually in size as it passes backwards ; it receives Fig. 150.* * Sinuses of the upper and back part of the skull. 1.

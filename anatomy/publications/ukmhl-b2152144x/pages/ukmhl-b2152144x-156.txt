LIGAMENTS OF THE LOWER JAW. 132 the fibrous cartilage is perforate, tlie synovial membranes com- municate. Besides the lower jaw, there are several other joints provided with a complete interarticular cartilage, and, consequently, with two synovial membranes; they are, the sterno-clavicular, acromio- clavicular, and the articidation of the ulna with the cimeiform hone. The interarticular fibrous-cartilages of the knee-joint are partial, and there is but one synovial membrane. The articulations of the heads of the ribs with the vertebrae have two synovial membranes separated by an interarticular ligament without fibrous-cartilage. Connected with the lower jaw, though not with the joint, is the stylo-maxillary ligament, a process of the deep cervical fascia ex- tended between the point of the styloid process and the angle of the jaw. It is attached to the jaw between the insertions of the mas- seter and internal pterygoid muscle, and separates the parotid from the submaxillary gland. Actions.â€”The movements of the lower jaw are depression, by which the mouth is opened, elevation, by which it is closed; a for- ward and backward movement, and a movement from side to side. In the movement of depression the interarticular cartilage glides forward on the eminentia articularis, carrying with it the condyle. If this movement be carried too far, the superior synovial membrane * In this sketch a section has been made through the joint, to show the position of the interarticular fibro-cartilage, and the manner of its adaptation to the articulating surfaces. 1. The glenoid fossa. 2. Eminentia articularis. 3. Interarticular flbro-cartilage. 4. Superior sjmovial ca\'ity. 5. Inferior synovial cavity. 6. An interarticular fibro-cartilage, removed from the joint, in order to show its oval and concave form; it is seen from below.

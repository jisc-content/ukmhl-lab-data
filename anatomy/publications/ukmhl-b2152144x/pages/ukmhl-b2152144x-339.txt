The External carotid artery (carotis erterna) ascends nearly perpendicularly from opposite the upper border of the thyroid carti- lage, to the space between the neck of the lower jaw and the meatus auditorius, where it divides into two terminal branches, the temporal and internal maxillary. Relations.â€”In front it is crossed by the posterior belly of the digastricus, stylo-hyoideus, and platysma myoides; by the hypo- glossal nerve near its origin; higher up it is situated in the substance of the parotid gland, and has in front the facial nerve and tempore- maxillary vein. BeJdnd, it is separated from the internal carotid by the stylo-pharyngeus and stylo-glossus muscle, glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and part of the parotid gland.

LIGAMENTS OF THE SCAPULA. 142 bones between which it is placed; and is not nnfrequently absent. When partial, it occupies the upper part of the articulation. The synovial membranes are delicate. There is, of course, but one, when the fibro-cartilage is incomplete. Fig. 79.* Actions.â€”The acromio-clavicular articulation admits of two move- ments, gliding of the surfaces on each other, and rotation of the scapula upon the extremity of the clavicle. 3. The proper ligaments of the scapula are the Coraco-acromial, Transverse. The coraco-acromial ligament (triangiilare) is a broad and thick triangular band, which forms a protecting arch over the shoulder joint. It is attached by its apex to the point of the acromion process, and by its base to the external border of the coracoid process its whole length. This ligament is in relation above with the under surface of the deltoid muscle; and below with the tendon of the supra-spinatus muscle, a bursa mucosa being usually intei-posol. * Ligaments of the scapula and shoulder joint. 1. Superior acromio-cla- vicular Hgament. 2. Coraco-clavicular hgament; this aspect of the hgament is named trapezoid. 3. Coraco-acromial ligament. 4. Transverse hgament. 5. Capsular ligament. 6. Coraco-humeral hgament. 7. The long tendon of the biceps issuing from the capstdar ligament, and entei'iug the bicipital groove.

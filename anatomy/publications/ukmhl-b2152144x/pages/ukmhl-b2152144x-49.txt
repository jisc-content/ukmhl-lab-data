OCCIPITAL BONE. 25 the posterior fontanelle. The inferior angle is the articular extre- mity of the basilar process. The lateral angles at each side project into the interval formed by the articulation of the posterior and in- ferior angle of the parietal with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Development.—By seven centres; four for the four parts of the ex- panded portion divided by the crucial ridge, one for each condyle, and one for the basilar process. Ossification commences in the expanded portion of the bone at a period anterior to the vertebrae ; at birth the bone consists of four distinct pieces; they are united at about the fifth or sixth year. After twenty the basilar process unites with the body of the sphenoid. Articulations.—With six bones; two parietal, two temporal, sphe- noid, and atlas. Attachment of Muscles.—To thirteen pairs : to the rough surface above the superior curved line, the occipito-frontalis; to the superior curved lime, the trapezius and sterno-mastoid; to the rough space between the curved lines, complexus, and splenius capitis; to the space between the inferior curved line and the foramen magnum, the rectus posticus major and minor, and obliquus superior; to the trans- verse process, the rectus lateralis; and to the basilar process, the reqtus anticus major and minor, and superior and middle constrictor muscles.

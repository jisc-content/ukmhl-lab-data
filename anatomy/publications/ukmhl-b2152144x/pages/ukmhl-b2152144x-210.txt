186 MUSCLES OP THE NECK. aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis, at about the middle of the temporal ridge, and inserted into the convexity of the fossa triangu- laris of the pinna. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument, and by the internal with the galea aponeurotica and temporal fascia. The Attrahens aurem (anterior auriculge), also triangular, arises from the lateral portion of the aponeurosis of the occipito- frontalis above the zygoma, and is inserted into the spine of the helix. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument; and by the internal with the galea aponeurotica, temporal fascia and temporal artery and veins. The Retrahens aurem (posterior auriculae), arises by two (some- times three) muscular slips from the root of the mastoid process. They are inserted into the posterior surface of the concha. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument, and by its internal surface with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Actions.-—The actions of the auricular muscles are expressed in their names; they have but little power in man, but are important muscles in brutes. MUSCLES OF THE NECK. The muscles of the neck may be arranged into eight groups, cor- responding with the natural divisions of the region; they are the 1. Superficial group. 2. Depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. 3. Elevators of the os hyoides and larynx. 4. Lingual group. 5. Pharyngeal group. 6. Soft palate group. 7. Prsevertebral group. 8. Proper muscles of the larynx. The muscles in each group are as follows :— 1. Superficial Group. 3. Elevators of the os ■m , . 1 hyoides and larynx. rlatysma myoides, ^ ^ Sterno-cleido-mastoideus. Digastricus, Stylo-hyoideus, 2. Depressors of the os Mylo-hoideus, hyoides and larynx. Genio-hyoideus, o, 1 • 1 Genio-hyo-giossus. bterno-hyoideus, Sterno-thyroideus, ^^^^^ Ihyro-hyoideus, *^ Omo-hyoideus.

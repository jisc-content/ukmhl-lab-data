621 LIGAMENTS OF THE LIVEK. through a fissure in its under surface, from the umbilicus to the inferior vena cava. They are theâ€” Longitudinal, Coronary, Two lateral, Round. The Longitudinal ligament {broad, ligamentum suspensorium hepatis) is an antero-posterior fold of peritoneum, extending from the^notch on the anterior margin of the liver to its posterior border. Between its two layers, in the anterior and free margin, is the round ligament. The Lateral ligaments are formed by the two layers of perito- neum, which pass from the under surface of the diaphragm to the posterior border of the liver; they correspond with its lateral lobes. The Coronary ligament is formed by the separation of the two layers forming the lateral ligaments near their point of convergence. Fig. 217.* The posterior layer is continued unbroken from one lateral ligament to the other; but the anterior quits the posterior at each side, and is continuous with the corresponding layer of the longitudinal liga- ment. In this way a large oval surface on the posterior border of the liver is left uncovered by peritoneum, and is connected to the diaphragm by cellular tissue. This space is formed principally by the right lateral ligament, and is pierced near its left extremity by * The upper surface of the hver. 1. The right lobe. 2. The left lobe. 3.

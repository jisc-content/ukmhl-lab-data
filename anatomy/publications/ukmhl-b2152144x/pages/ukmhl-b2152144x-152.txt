128 LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. The movements taking place between the cranium and atlas, are those of flexion and erection, giving rise to the forward nodding of the head. When this motion is increased to any extent, the whole of the cervical region concurs in its production. 3. Articulation of the Axis with the Occipital hone.â€”The liga- ments of this articulation are three in number, Occipito-axoid^ Two odontoid. The occipito-axoid ligament (apparatus ligamentosus colli) is a broad band, which covers in the odontoid process and its ligaments. It is attached below to the body of the axis, where it is continuous with the posterior common ligament; superiorly it is inserted by a Mg. 70* broad expansion, into the basilar groove of the occipital bone. It is firmly connected opposite the body of the axis, with the dura mater ; and is sometimes described as consisting of a central and two lateral portions. The odontoid ligaments (alaria) are two short and thick fasciculi of fibres, which pass outwards from the apex of the odontoid process, to the sides of the occipital foramen and condyles. A third and smaller fasciculus (ligamentum dentis suspensorium) proceeds from the apex of the odontoid process to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. These ligaments serve to limit the extent to which rotation of the head may be carried, hence they are termed check ligaments. * The upper part of the vertebral canal, opened from behind in order to show the occipito-axoid ligament. 1. The basilar portion of the sphenoid bone. 2. Section of the occipital bone. 3. The atlas, its posterior arch re- moved. 4. The axis, the posterior arch also removed. 5. The occipito-axoid ligament, rendered prominent at its middle by the projection of the odontoid process. 6. Lateral and capsular ligament oi the occipito-atloid articulation. 7. Capsular ligament between the articulating processes of the atlas and axis.

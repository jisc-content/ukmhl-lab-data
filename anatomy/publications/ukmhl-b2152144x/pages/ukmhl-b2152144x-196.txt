MUSCLES OF THE PACE. 172 Dissection.â€”The dissection of tlie face is to be effected by conti- nuing the longitudinal incision of the vertex of the previous dissec- tion onwards to the tip of the nose, and thence doAvnwards to the margin of the upper lip; then carry an incision along the margia of the lip to the angle of the mouth, and transversely across the face to the angle of the lower-jaw. Lastly, divide the integument in front of the external ear upwards to the transverse incision which was made for exposing the occipito-frontalis. Dissect the integu- ment and superficial fascia carefully from the whole of the region Fig. 99* * Muscles of the head and face. 1. Frontal portion of the oceipito-froii- talis. 2, Its occipital portion. 3. Its aponeurosis. 4. The orbicularis palpe- brarum, which conceals the corrugator supercihi and tensor tarsi. 5. Pyra- midaJis nasi. 6. Compressor naris. 7. Orbicularis oris. 8. Levator labii superioris alseque nasi; the adjoining fasciculus between numbers 8 and 9 is the labial portion of the muscle. 9.

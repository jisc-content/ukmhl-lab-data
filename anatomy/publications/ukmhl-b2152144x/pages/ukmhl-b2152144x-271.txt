247 TRICEPS BRACHII. septum. The middle or long head (anconseus longus) arises from the lower part of the head and adjoining part of the border of the scapula, to the extent of about an inch. The three heads, passing downwards in different directions, unite to form a broad muscle, which is inserted into the olecranon process of the ulna, and sends an expansion to the deep fascia of the forearm. A small bursa is situated between the tendon of the muscle and the upper part of the Fig. 115.* olecranon. The scapular head of the triceps passes between the teres minor and major, and divides the tri- angular space between those two muscles into two smaller spaces, one of which is triangular, the other quadrangular. The trian- gular space is bounded by the teres minor, teres major, and scapular head of the triceps; it gives pas- sage to the dorsalis scapulae artery and veins. The quadrangular space is bounded on three sides by the three preceding muscles, and on the fourth by the humerus. Through this space pass the posterior cir- cumflex artery and veins, and cir- cumflex nerve. Beneath the lower part of the tri- ceps are two small fasciculi arising from the humerus, and descending one on either side of the fossa of the olecranon to be inserted into the capsule of the elbow-joint. These have been named suh-anco- neus, they are analogous to the sub-crureus. Relations. â€”By its posterior sur- face with the deep and superficial fascia and integument. By its an- terior surface with the superior profunda artery, musculo-spiral nerve, humerus, intermuscular aponeurosis which separates it from the brachialis anticus, and elbow-joint. The scapular head is in relation posteriorly with the deltoid and teres minor; anteriorly with the subscapularis, teres * Posterior view of the upper arm, and triceps muscle. 1. Its external head. 2.

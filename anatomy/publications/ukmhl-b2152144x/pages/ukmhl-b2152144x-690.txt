Vessels and Nerves.â€”The mammae are supplied with arteries from the thoracic branches of the axillary, from the intercostals, and from the internal mammary. The veins form an incomplete circle around the base of the nipple (circulus venosus Halleri), from which larger veins conduct the blood to the circumference of the gland, and by these communications form a plexus on its surface. They termi- nate in the axillary vein, the internal mammary, the intercostals and the jugular veins. The Lymphatics take the course of the veins, inwards, to the an- terior mediastinal glands; and outwards along the border of the pectoralis major to the axillary glands. The Nerves of the mammary gland are derived from the anterior cutaneous branches of the third, fourth, and fifth intercostal nerves; and from the lateral cutaneous branches of the same nerves.

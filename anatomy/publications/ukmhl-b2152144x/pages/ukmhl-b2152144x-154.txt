LTGAMENTS OP THE LOWER JAW. 130 the odontoid process, some fibres are sent downwards to be attached to the body of the axis, and others pass upwards to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone; hence the Hgament has a cross-like appearance, and has been termed cruciform. A synovial membrane is situated between the transverse ligament and odontoid process; and another between that process and the anterior arch of the atlas. Actions.—It is the peculiar disposition of the transverse ligament in relation to the odontoid process, that enables the atlas, and with it the entire cranium, to rotate upon the axis; the perfect freedom of movement between these bones being ensured by the two synovial membranes. The lower part of the ring, formed by the transverse ligament with the atlas, is smaller than the upper, while the summit of the odontoid process is larger than its base; so that the process is retained in position by the transverse ligament, when the other ligaments are cut through. The extent to which rotation of the head upon the axis can be carried, is determined by the odontoid or check ligaments. The odontoid process with its ligaments is covered in by the occipito-axoid ligament. 5. Articulation of tlie Lower Jaw.—The lower jaw has properly but one ligament, the external lateral; the ligaments usually de- scribed are three in number; to which may be added, as appertain- ing to the mechanism of the joint, an interarticular fibrous-cartilage, and two synovial membranes, thus :— External lateral, Interarticular fibrous cartilage, Internal lateral. Two synovial membranes. Capsular, * An external -dew of the articulation of the lower jaw. 1. Zygomatic arch. 2. Tubercle of the zygoma. 3. Ramus of the lower jaw. 4.

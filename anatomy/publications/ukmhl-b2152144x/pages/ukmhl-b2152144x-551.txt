CHOROID COAT. 527 the line of junction of the cornea and sclerotic, by a dense white structure, the ciliary ligament, which surrounds the circumference of the iris like a ring. The choroid membrane is composed of three layers :â€”an external or venous layer, which consists principally of veins arranged in a peculiar manner : hence they have been named vence vorticosce. The marking on the surface of the membrane produced by these veins resembles so many centres to which a number of curved lines converge. It is this layer which is connected with the ciliary liga- ment. The middle or arterial layer (tunica Ruyschiana)* is formed principally by the ramifications of minute arteries. It is reflected inwards at its junction with the ciliary ligament, so as to form the ciliary processes. The internal layer is a delicate membrane (membrana -pigmenti) composed of several laminse of nucleated hexagonal cells, which contain the granules of pigmentum nigrum, and are arranged so as to resemble a tesselated pavement. Fig. I79.t 3 * Euysch was born at the Hague in 1638, and was appointed Professor of Anatomy at Amsterdam in 1665. His whole Hfe was employed in making injected preparations, for which he is justly celebrated, and he died at the advanced age of ninety-three years. He came to the conclusion that the body was entirely made up of vessels. t A dissection of the eyeball, showing its second tunic, and the mode of distribution of the vense vorticosae of the choroid.

559 STRUCTURE OF NAILS, tion of newly-formed cells to its under surface. It is this constant change occurring in the under surface of the nail, co-operating with the continual formation taking place along the margin of the root, which ensures the growth of the nail in the proper direction. The nail derives a peculiarity of appearance from the disposition and form of the papill83 on the ungual surface of the derma (matrix). Thus, beneath the root, and for a short distance onwards towards its middle, the derma is covered by papillae which are more minute, and consequently less vascular than the papillae somewhat farther on. This patch of papillae is bounded by a semilunar line, and that part of the nail covering it being lighter in colour than the rest, has been termed lunula. Beyond the lunula the papillge are raised into longitudinal plaits, which are exceedingly vascular, and give a deeper tint of redness to the nail. These plait-like papillae of the * Anatomy of the skin. 1. Epiderma. 2. Eete mucosum or deep layer of the epiderma. 3. Two of the quadrilateral papillary clumps, such as are seen in the palm of the hand or sole of the foot; they are composed of minute conical papillte. 4. Deep layer of the derma, the corium. 5. Adipose cells. 6. A sudoriparous gland with its spiral duet, such as is seen in the pabn of the hand or sole of the foot. 7. Another sudoriparous gland with a straighter duct, such as is seen in the scalp. 8. Two hairs from the scalp, enclosed in their foUicles; their relative depth in the skin is preserved. 9. _A pair of sebiparous glands, opening by short ducts into the follicle of the hair.

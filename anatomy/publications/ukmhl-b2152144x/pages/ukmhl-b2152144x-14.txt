VI PREFACE. into the study of Anatomy, than by any other book. These are my reasons for interesting myself in its suc- cess, and for contributing my remarks for its emenda- tion." In pursuance of these observations, Dr. Retzius had conveyed to me an interleaved copy of the work con- taining many notes for its improvement; and, further- more, took the trouble of sending to me, from across the seas, a preparation of the ligaments of the foot, shoAving the ligament to which he has given the name of ligamentum fundiforme (page 30-5). More deeply cherished is the promise conveyed in the following pas- sage: "If the Almighty God will continue to bless me with health and life for some years longer, I will assist you in revising every new Edition, and intro- ducing all those new discoveries in anatomy which may be of use to the Students of Medicine." One of his letters contains the following question : " Do you not think that some few figures representing the villi, the epithelium, and the follicles of the mucous membrane of the intestinal canal would be useful, since that structure plays so important a part in disease?' This question is responded to by the ten figures num- bered 206 to 216. With the exception of figure 207, which is copied from Henle, these figures were drawn by myself, with the aid of the camera lucida, and will suggest to the student some points of novelty in regard to the structure of the intestinal mucous membrane. I may refer particularly to figure 214, showing the microscopic appearance of a patch of Peyer's glands; and figure 216, the muciparous glands of the small intes- tine. While thus acknowledging the assistance given to

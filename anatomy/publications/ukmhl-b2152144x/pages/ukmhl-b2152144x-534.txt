SPHENO-PALATIFE GANGLION. 510 The descending branches are the three palatine nerves, anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior or large palatine nerve descends from the ganglion through the posterior palatine canal, and emerges at the posterior palatine foramen. It then passes forward in the substance of the hard palate to which it is distributed, and communicates with the Fig. 175.* * Cranial ganglia of the sympathetic nerre. 1. Ganglion of Eibes. 2. Fila- ment by which it communicates with the carotid plexvis (3). 4. Ophthalmic or lenticular ganghon, giving oW ciliary branches. 5. Part of the inferior division of the third nerve communicating with the ganghon by means of a short thick branch (short root). 6. Part of the nasal nerve, connected with the ganghon by means of a longer branch (long root). 7. A slender filament (the sympathetic root) sent directly backwards from the ganglion to the carotid plexus. 8. Part of the sixth nerve in the cavernous sinus, receiving two branches from the carotid plexus. 9. Meckel's ganglion (spheno-palatine). 10. Spheno-palatine nerves. 11. Descending or palatine branches. 12. Its internal or nasal branches. 13. Naso-palatine branch, one of the nasal branches. 14. Posterior branch of the ganghon, the Vidian nerve. 15. Its carotid branch (n. petrosus profundus) communicating with the carotid plexus. 16. Its petrosal branch (n. petrosus superflciahs major), joining the intumeseentia ganghformis of the facial nerve. 17. Facial nerve. 18. Chorda tympani nerve, descending to join the gustatory nerve. 19. Gustatory nerve. 20. Submaxillary ganghon, receiving the chorda tympani, and other filaments from the gustatory. 21. Superior cervical ganglion of the sjpnpathetic.

403 PULMONAKY VEINS. is surrounded by the hepatic plexus of nerves and lymphatics. At the transverse fissure each primary branch divides into numerous secondary branches which ramify through the portal canals, and give off vaginal and interlobular veins, and the latter terminate in the lobular venous plexus of the lobules of the liver. The portal vein within the liver receives the venous blood from the capillaries of the hepatic artery. PULMONARY VEINS. The pulmonary veins (vense pulmonales), four in number, return the arterial blood from the lungs to the left auricle of the heart; they differ from veins in general, in the area of their cylinders being but little larger than that of the corresponding arteries, and in ac- companying singly each branch of the pulmonary artery. They commence in the capillaries upon the parietes of the intercellular passages and air-cells, and unite to form a single trunk for each lobe. The vein of the middle lobe of the right lung unites with the supe- rior vein, so as to form the two trunks which open into the left auricle. Sometimes they remain separate, and then there are three pulmons^ry veins on the right side. The right pulmonary veins pass behind the right auricle to the left auricle; the left pass in front of the descending aorta; they both pierce the pericardium. Within the lung the branches of the pulmonary veins are behind the bron- chial tubes, and those of the pulmonary artery in front; but at the root of the lungs the veins are in front, next the arteries, and then the bronchi. There are no valves in the pulmonary veins. D D 2

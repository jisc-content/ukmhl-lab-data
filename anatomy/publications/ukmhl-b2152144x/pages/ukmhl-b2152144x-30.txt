By one other repetition of the same process, each cell producing four, or five, or six young cells, * Figures illustrative of the development of bone; they are magnified 155 times, and drawn with the camera lucida. a. A portion of cartilage the farthest removed from the seat of ossification, showing simple nucleated cells, having an ordinary size of ^ooa Qf inch, long diameter, b. The same cartilage, nearer the seat of ossification; each simple cell has produced two, which are a httle larger than the cells in figure a. t The same cartilage, stiU nearer the seat of ossification; each single cell of B has given birth to four, five, or six cells, which form clusters. These clusters become larger towards the right of the figure, and their cells more numerous and larger, yb5q of ^ inch, long diameter.

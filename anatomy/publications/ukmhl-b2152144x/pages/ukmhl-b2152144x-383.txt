359 •"■INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. The Internal Iliac Artery {iliaca interna; hypogastrica), is a short trunk, varying in length from an inch to two inches. It de- scends obliquely forwards to a point opposite the upper margin of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, where it divides into an anterior and a posterior trunk. In the foetus, the internal iliac artery under the name of hypogastric is continued onwards by the side of the fundus of the bladder to near its apex, whence it ascends by the side of the linea alba and urachus to the umbilicus, where it becomes the umbilical artery. After birth, this artery ceases to be pervious beyond the side of the bladder, and the obliterated portion is con- verted into a fibrous cord. The projection of these two cords on the inner wall of the abdomen causes the depression on each side, which goes by the name of the peritoneal fossa. Relations.—This artery rests externally on the sacral plexus and Mg. 144.* * Iliac arteries. 1. Aorta. 2. Left common iliac artery. 3. External iliac. 4. Epigastric artery. 5. Circumflexa ilu. 6.

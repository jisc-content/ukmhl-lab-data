Circular, The Cavernous sinuses are named from presenting a structure similar to that of the corpus cavernosum penis. They are situated on each side of the sella turcica, receiving, anteriorly, the ophthalmic veins through the sphenoidal fissures, and terminating posteriorly in the inferior petrosal sinuses. In the external wall of each cavernous sinus is the internal carotid artery, several filaments of the carotid plexus, the third, fourth, ophthalmic, and sixth nerve. These structures are separated from the blood flowing through the sinus, by the tubular lining membrane. Besides the ophthalmic vein the Fig. 151.* * Sinuses of the base of the skull. 1.

STRUCTURE OP THE NOSE. 522 is prolonged downvards and forwards in the direction of the poste- rior border of the ala by three or four small fibro-cartilaginous plates (sesamoid cartilages, cartilagines minores), which are appendages of the alar fibro-cartilage. The whole of these fibro- cartilages are connected with each other, and to the bones, by perichondrium, which, from its membranous struc- ture, permits of the freedom of motion existing between them. 5. The Mucous membrane lining the interior of the nose, is continuous with the skin externally, and with the pituitary membrane of the nasal fossse within. Around the entrance of the nostrils it is provided with the vi- brissce. 6. Vessels and Nerves.â€” The Arteries of the nose are the lateralis nasi from the facial, and the nasalis septi from the superior coronary. Its Nerves are, the facial, infra-orbital, and nasal branch of the ophthalmic. NASAL POSS^. To obtain a good view of the nasal fossce, the face must be divided through the nose by a vertical incision, a little to one side of the middle line. The Nasal fossce are two irregular, compressed cavities, extending backwards from the nose to the pharynx. They are bounded su- jieriorly by the lateral cartilage of the nose, and by the nasal, ethmoid, and sphenoid bone ; inferiorly by the hard palate ; and, in the middle line, they are separated by a bony and fibro-cartila- ginous septum. A plan of the boundaries of the nasal fossae will be found at page 65. Upon the outer wall of each fossa, in the dried skull, are three * The fibro-cartilages and bones of the nose viewed from the side. After Arnold. 1. Nasal bone. 2.

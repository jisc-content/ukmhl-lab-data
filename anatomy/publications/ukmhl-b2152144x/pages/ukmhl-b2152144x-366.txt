342 EADIAL ARTERY. The Radial artery (radialis), one of the divisions of the brachial, appears, from its direction, to be the continuation of that trunk. It runs along the radial side of the forearm, from the bend of the elbow to the wrist; it then turns backwards around the base of the thumb, beneath its extensor tendons, and passes between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, into the palm of the hand. It next crosses the metacarpal bones to the ulnar side of the hand, forming the deep palmar arch, and terminates by inos- culating with the superficial palmar arch. In the upper half of its course, the radial artery is situated between the supinator longus muscle, by which it is slightly overlapped, and the pronator radii teres; in the lower half, between the tendons of the supinator longus and flexor carpi radialis. It rests in succes- sion on the supinator brevis, pronator radii teres, radial origin of the flexor sublimis, flexor longus pollicis, and pronator quadratus; and is covered in by the integument and fasciae. At the wrist it is situated in contact with the external lateral ligament and beneath the extensor tendons of the thumb; and, in the palm of the hand, beneath the flexor tendons. It is accompanied by vense comites; and by its middle third is in relation with the radial nerve which lies to its outer side. Plan of the Relations of the Eadial Artery in the Forearm. In Front.

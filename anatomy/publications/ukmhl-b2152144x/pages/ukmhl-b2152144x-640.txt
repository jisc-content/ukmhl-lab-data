616 GLANDS OP THE INTESTINE. pearance of pale disks pierced with mimerous small irregular fissures; but, under the microscope, they are found to be composed of a reti- cular and alveolar structure. The reticular structure, forming the septa between the alveoli, measures between and ^ of an inch in breadth; it is highly vas- Mg. 214.* . cular, and presents on its surface the numerous small angular and oval openings of shallow pits. The al- veoli are quadrangular and oblong in form, and measure in longest diameter about of an inch. Their floor is somewhat raised in the centre by a vascular net- work, and in the foveolse formed by the radiating branches of this vascular network are the openings of numerous simple follicles. The alveoli are considerably less vascular than the re- ticular structure; but I have been unable to discover anything to warrant the idea of a sacculus, such as that which is supposed to constitute a saccular gland. The cellular coat of the intestine is closely adherent to the mu- Fig. 215.t cous membrane in the situ- ation of these glandular patches, and more richly supplied with vessels than elsewhere. The solitary glands of the large intestine are small round whitish bodies of about * A portion of one of Peyer's glands, magnified 19 times.

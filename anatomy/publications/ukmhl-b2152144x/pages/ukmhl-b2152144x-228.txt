204 MUSCLES OP THE TRUNK. Eighth Group.—Muscles of the Larynx. These muscles are described with the anatomy of the larynx, in Chapter X. MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. The muscles of the trunk may be subdivided into four natural groups : viz., 1. Muscles of the back. 2. Muscles of the thorax. 3. Muscles of the abdomen. 4. Muscles of the perineum. 1. Muscles of the Bach.—The region of the hack, in consequence of its extent, is common to the neck, upper extremities, and abdo- men. The muscles of which it is composed are numerous, and may be arranged into six layers. First Layer. Trapezius, Latissimus dorsi. Second Layer. Levator anguli scapulae, Ehomboideus minor, Ehomboideus major. Third Layer. Serratus posticus superior, Serratus posticus inferior, Splenius capitis, Splenius colli. Fourth Layer. (Dorsal group.) Sacro-lumbalis, Longissimus dorsi. Spinalis dorsi. (Cervical Grroup.) Cervicalis ascendens, Transversalis cervicis, Trachelo-mastoideus, Complexus. Fifth Lawyer. (Dorsal Group.) Semi-spinalis dorsi, Semi-spinalis colli. (Cervical Group.) Rectus anticus major. Rectus anticus minor. Rectus lateralis, Obliquus inferior, Obliquus superior. Sixth Layer. Multifidus spinee, Inter-spinales, Inter-transversales, Levatores costarum. First Layer. Dissection.—The muscles of this layer are to be dissected by making an incision along the middle line of the back, from the tubercle on the occipital bone to the coccyx. From the upper point of this incision carry a second transversely outwards to the back of

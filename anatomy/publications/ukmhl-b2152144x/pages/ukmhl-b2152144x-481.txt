OPTIC NERVE. 457 of the nares; they are arranged into three groups, an inner group, reddish in colour and soft, which spread out upon the septum narium; an outer- group, whiter and more firm, which descend through bony canals in the outer wall of the nares, and are dis- tributed on the superior and middle turbinated bones; and a middle group, which supply the mucous membrane of the roof of the nasal fossae. Fig. 164.* Second pair. Optic.â€”The optic nerve, a nerve of large size, arises from the corpora geniculata on the posterior and inferior aspect * Olfactory nerve, with its distribution on the septum nasi. The nares have been divided by a longitudinal section made immediately to the left of the septum, the right naris being preserved entire. 1. Frontal sinus. 2. Nasal bone. 3. Crista gaUi process of the ethmoid bone. 4. Sphenoidal sinus of the left side. 5. Sella turcica. 6. BasUar process of the sphenoid and oc- cipital bone. 7. Posterior opening of the right naris. 8. Opening of the Eustachian tube in the upper part of the pharynx. 9. Soft palate divided through its middle. 10. Cut surface of the hard palate, a. Olfactory nerve. h. Its three roots of origin, c. Its bulb, from which the filaments are seen to proceed which spread out in the substance of the pituitary membrane. d. Nasal nerve, a branch of the ophthalmic, descending into the left naris from the anterior foramen of the cribriform plate, and dividing into its external and internal branch, e. Naso-palatine nerve, a branch of the - spheno-palatine ganghon, distributing twigs to the mucous membrane of the septum nasi in its course to {f) the anterior palatine foramen, g. Branches of the naso-palatine nerve to the palate, h. Anterior and posterior palatine nerves, i. Septum nasi.

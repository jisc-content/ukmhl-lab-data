Upon its posterior part is the mastoid foramen; and below, the mas- toid process. In front of the mastoid process is the external auditory- foramen, surrounded by the external auditory process; and in front of this foramen the glenoid cavity, bounded above by the middle root of the zygoma, and in front by its tubercle. The zygomatic portion or fossa is the irregular cavity below the zygoma, bounded in front by the superior maxillary bone, internally by the external pterygoid plate, above by part of the great ^ing of the sphenoid, squamous portion of the temporal bone, and temporal fossa; and externally by the zygomatic arch and ramus of the lower * A front view of the skull. 1.

HYPOGASTRIC PLEXUS. 519 The branches of the lumbar ganglia are branches of communica- tion and branches of distribution. The external or communicating branches, two or three in number, and longer than in the other regions, communicate with the lumbar nerves. The internal or visceral branches consist of two sets ; of which the upper pass inwards in front of the abdominal aorta, and join the aortic j^lexiis; the lower branches cross the common iliac arteries, and unite over the promontory of the sacrum, to form the hypogastric plexus. The Hypogastric plexus is formed by the termination of the aortic plexus, and by the union of branches from the lower lumbar ganglia. It is situated over the promontory of the sacrum, between the two common iliac arteries, and bifurcates inferiorly into two lateral portions, inferior hypogastric plexuses, which communicate with branches from the third and fourth sacral nerves. It distributes branches to all the viscera of the pelvis, and sends filaments which accompany the branches of the internal iliac artery. SACRAL PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. j â– ) , The Sacral ganglia are four or five in number on each side. They are situated upon the sacrum, close to the anterior sacral foramina, and resemble the lumbar ganglia in form and mode of connexion, although much smaller in size. The external or communicating branches are two from each ganglion, which pass outwards to communicate with the anterior sacral nerves and with the coccygeal nerve. The internal or visceral branches communicate very freely with the inferior hypogastric plexuses, and are distributed to the pelvic viscera. The last pair of sacral ganglia give off branches which join a small ganglion, situated on the first bone of the coccyx, called the ganglion impar, or azygos. This ganglion serves to connect the ex- tremities of the two sympathetic nerves. It gives off a few small branches to the coccyx and rectum ; and communicates with the coccygeal nerve.

MUSCLES OP THE GLUTEAL REGION. 264 tuberosity of the iscliium, one between its tendon and tbe trochanter major, and one between it and the tendon of the vastus externus. Relations.â€”By its superficial surface with a thin aponeurotic fascia, which separates it from the superficial fascia and integument, and near its insertion, with the vastus externus. By its deep sur- face with the gluteus medius, pyriformis, gemelli, obturator in- ternus, quadratus femoris, sacro-ischiatic foramina, great sacro- ischiatic ligament, tuberosity of the ischium, semi-membranosus, semi-tendinosus, biceps, and adductor magnus; gluteal vessels and nerves, ischiatic vessels and nerves, and internal pudic vessels and nerve. By its upper border it overlaps the gluteus medius; and by the lovjer border forms the lower margin of the nates. The gluteus maximus must be turned down from its origin, in order to bring the next muscles into view. The GrLUTEUS MEDIUS is placed in front of, rather than beneath Fig. 121.* * Deep muscles of the gluteal region. 1. Hium. 2. Sacrum. 3. Posterior sacroiliac Hgaments. 4. Tuberosity of the ischium. 5.

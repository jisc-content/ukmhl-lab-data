URETHRA. 648 in considerable number from the base of the glans, and converge on the dorsum penis, to form a large dorsal vein, which receives other veins from the corpus cavernosum and spongiosum in its course, and passes backwards between two layers of the ligamentum suspensorium, and through the triangular ligament beneath the arch of the pubes, to terminate in the prostatic plexus. The Lymphatics terminate in the inguinal glands. The nerves are derived from the pudic nerve, sacral plexus, and hypogastric plexus. URETHRA. The urethra is the membranous canal extending from the neck of the bladder to the.meatus urinarius. It is curved in its course, and composed of two layers, a mucous coat and an elastic fibrous coat. The mucous coat is thin and smooth; it is continuous, in- Fig. 226.* * A longituditial section of the bladder, prostate gland, and penis, showing the urethra. 1. The urachus attached to the upper part of the fundus of the bladder, 2, The recto-vesical fold of peritoneum, at its point of reflexion from th^ base of the bladder, upon the anterior surface of the rectum. 3. The opening of the right ureter. 4. A sHght ridge, formed by the muscle of the ureter, and extending from the termination of the ureter to the commence- ment of the urethra. This ridge forms the lateral boundary of the trigonum vesicae. 5. The commencement of the urethra; the elevation of mucous membrane immediately below the number is the uvula vesicae. The con- striction of the bladder at this point is the neck of the bladder. 6. The prostatic portion of the urethra. 7. The prostate gland; the difierence of thickness of the gland, above and below the urethra, is shown. 8.

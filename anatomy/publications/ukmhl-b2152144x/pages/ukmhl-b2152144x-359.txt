TRANSVERSA COLLI ARTERY. 335 the cervical vertebrae, lying in the groove between the scalenus anticus and rectus anticus major. It is distributed to the deep muscles and glands of the neck, and sends branches through the intervertebral foramina to supply the spinal cord and its membranes. The Supra-scapular artery (transversa scapulge; scapularis superior) passes obliquely outwards behind the clavicle, and over tlie ligament of the supra-scapular notch, to the supra-spinatus fossa. It crosses in its course the scalenus anticus muscle, phrenic nerve, and subclavian artery, is distributed to the muscles of the dorsum of the scapula, and inosculates with the posterior scapular, and beneath the acromion process with the dorsal branch of the subsca- pular artery. At the supra-scapular notch it sends a large branch outwards, which pierces the trapezius muscle, and becomes cutaneous at the tip of the shoulder (acromialis). The supra-scapular artery sometimes arises directly from the subclavian. Fig. 137.* The Transversa colli artery (scapularis posterior) passes transversely across the subclavian triangle at the root of the neck, to the anterior border of the levator anguK scapulae, where it divides into two terminal branches, the cervicalis superficialis and posterior scapular. In its course it lies above the supra-scapular artery, and crosses the scaleni muscles and brachial plexus of nerves, often * Branches of the right subclavian artery. 1. Arteria innominata. 2.

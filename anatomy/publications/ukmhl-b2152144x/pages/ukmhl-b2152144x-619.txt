595 FORAMEN OF WINSLOW. (Diaphragm.) Broad, coronary, and lateral ligaments. (Liver.) Lesser omentum. (Stomach.) Grreater omentum. (Transverse colon.) Transverse meso-colon. Mesentery, Meso-rectum, Eecto-vesical fold. False ligaments of the bladder. And in the female, the— Broad ligaments of the uterus. The ligaments of the liver will be described mth that organ. The Lesser omentum (gastro-hepatic) is the duplicature which passeis between the liver and the upper border of the stomach. It is extremely thin, excepting at its right border, where it is free, and contains between its layers, the— Hepatic artery. Portal vein, Ductus communis choledochus, Lymphatics, Hepatic plexus of nerves. These structures are enclosed in a loose cellular tissue, called Glisson^s capsule,* The relative position of the three vessels is, the artery to the left, the duct to the right, the vein between and behind. If the finger be introduced behind this right border of the lesser omentum, it will be situated in an opening called the foramen of Winslow. f In front of the finger will lie the right border of the lesser omentum ; behind it the diaphragm, covered by the ascending or posterior layer of the peritoneum ; below, the hepatic artery, curving forward from the cceliac axis; and above, the lobus Spigelii. inferiorly marks the course of the hepatic artery forwards, to enter between the layers of the lesser omentum. 10. The mesentery encircling the small intestine. 11'. The recto-vesical fold, formed by the descending anterior layer. 12. The anterior layer traced upwards upon the internal surface of the abdominal parietes to the layer (1), with which the examination com- menced. * Francis Grlisson, Professor of Medicine in the University of Cambridge.

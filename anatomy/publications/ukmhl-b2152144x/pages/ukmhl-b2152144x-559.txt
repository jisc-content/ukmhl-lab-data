535 MEIBOMIAN GLANDS. mencement of the lacus lachrymalis, and are attached to the margin of the orbit by the tendo oculi. At their outer extremity they terminate at a short distance from the angle of the canthns, and are retained in position by means of a decussation of the fibrous structure of the broad tarsal ligament, called the external pal- pebral or external tarsal ligament. The Fibrous membrane of the lids is firmly attached to the peri- osteum, around the margin of the orbit, by its circumference, and to the tarsal cartilages by its central margin. It is thick and dense on the outer half of the orbit, but becomes thin to its inner side. Its use is to retain the tarsal cartilages in their place and give sup- port to the lids; hence it has been named the broad tarsal ligament. The Meibomian glands* are embedded in the substance of the car- tilages, and are very distinctly seen on examining the inner aspect of the lids. They have the appearance of parallel strings of pearls, Fig. 183.t about thirty in number in the upper cartilage, and somewhat fewer in the lower ; and open by minute foramina on the edges of the lids. They correspond in length with the breadth of the cartilage, and are consequently longer in the upper than in the lower lid. Each gland consists of a single lengthened follicle or tube, into which a number of small clustered follicles open : the latter are so numerous as almost to conceal the tube by which the secretion is poured out upon the margin of the lids. Occasionally an arch is formed between two of them, and produces a graceful appearance. * Henry Meibomius " De Vasis Palpebrarum Novis," 1666. t Meibomian glands, as seen upon the inner side of the eyelids.

DEVELOPMENT OP BONE. 7 a cluster is formed, containing from thirty to fifty cells. These clusters lie in immediate relation with the punctum ossificationis; they are oval in figure (about ^hr of i^ch in length by in breadth), and placed in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the bone. The cells composing the cluster lie transversely with regard to its axis. In the first instance they are closely compressed, but by degrees are parted by a thin layer of intercellular substance, and each cluster is separated from neighbouring clusters by a broader Fig. 4* i ^Sijer (^^\ 0 of an inch) of intercellular substance. Such are the changes which occur in cartilage preparatory to the formation of bone. Ossification is accomplished by the formation of very fine and deli- cate fibres within the intercellular substance : this process commences at the punctum ossificationis, and extends from that point through every part of the bone, in a longitudinal in long, and in a radiated direction in flat bones. Starting from the punctum ossificationis, the fibres embrace each cluster of cells, and then send branches between the individual cells of each group. In this manner the network, characteristic of bone, is formed, while the cells by their conjunction constitute the permanent areolse and Haversian canals. With a high * The same cartilage at the seat of ossification; the clusters of cells are arranged in columns; the intercellular spaces between the columns being 3^50 of an inch in breadth. To the right of the figure osseous fibres are seen occupying the interceUiilar spaces, at first boimding the clusters laterally, then splitting them longitudinally, and encirchng each separate cell. The greater opacity of the right-hand border is due to a threefold cause, the in- crease of osseous fibres, the opacity of the contents of the cells, and the mul- tiphcation of oil-globules. In the lower part of the figure some attempt has been made to show the texture of the cells.

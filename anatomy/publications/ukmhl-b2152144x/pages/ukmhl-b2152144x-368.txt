344 RADIAL ARTERY. Mg. 139.* The Dorsalis indicis is a very small brancli which runs along the radial bor- der of the metacarpal bone and phalanges of the index finger. The Princeps pollicis, the great artery of the thumb, passes along the metacarpal bone of the thumb, between the first dorsal interosseous (abductor indicis) and flexor brevis pollicis to the base of the first phalanx; and, be- tween the two heads of the latter muscle, in the gToove of the tendon of the flexor longus, it divi.des into two collateral branches for the palmar borders of the thumb. The Radialis indicis, the digital branch of the radial side of the index finger, is directed inwards between the abductor indicis and the flexor brevis and adductor pollicis . to the side of .the finger, along which it is dis- tributed, forming its radial * Arteries of the forearm. 1.

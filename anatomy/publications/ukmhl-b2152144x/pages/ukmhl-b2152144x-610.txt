ANATOMY OF THE LUNGS. 586 The right lung is larger than the left, in consequence of the in- clination of the heart to the left side. It is also shorter, from the great convexity of the liver, which presses the diaphragm upwards upon the right side of the chest considerably above the level of the left; and it has three lobes. The left lung is smaller, has but two lobes, but is longer than the right. Each lung is retained in its place by its root, which is formed by the pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins and bronchial tubes, together with the bronchial vessels and pulmonary plexuses of nerves. The groove on the surface of the lung where the vessels enter its substance is the hilum pulmonis ; and the position of the large vessels in the Fig. 199* * Anatomy of the heart and lungs. 1.

160 TARSAL ARTICULATIONS. 8. Articulation of the Tarsal Bones.—The ligaments v/hicli con- nect the seven bones of the tarsus to each other are of three kinds,— Dorsal, Plantar, Interosseous. The dorsal ligaments are small fasciculi of parallel fibres, which pass from each bone to all the neighbouring bones with which it ar- ticulates. The only dorsal ligaments deserving of particular mention are, the external snad poste7'ior calcaneo-astragaloid, which, with the interosseous ligament, complete the articulation of the astragalus with the OS calcis; the superior and internal calcaneo-cuboid liga- ments ; and the superior astragalo-scaphoid ligament. The internal calcaneo-cuboid, and the superior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, which are closely united posteriorly in the deep groove which intervenes betAveen the astragalus and os calcis, separate anteriorly to reach * External view of the ankle joint. 1. The tibia. 2. External malleolus of the fibula. 3, 3. Astragalus. 4. Os calcis. 5. Cuboid bone. 6. Anterior fasciculus of the external lateral ligament attached to the astragalus. 7., Its middle fasciculus, attached to the os calcis. 8. Its posterior fasciculus, at- tached to the astragalus. 9. The anterior ligament of the ankle. t Posterior \'ie\v of the ankle joint. 1. Lower part of the interosseous membrane. 2. Posterior inferior ligament connecting the tibia and fibula. 3. Transverse ligament. 4. Internal lateral hgament. 5. Posterior fascicu- lus of the external lateral hgament. 6. Middle fasciculus of the external lateral ligament. 7. Sjnovial membrane of the ankle joint. 8, Posterior tuberosity of the os calcis.

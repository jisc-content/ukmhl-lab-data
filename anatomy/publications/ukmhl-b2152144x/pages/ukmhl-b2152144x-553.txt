THIRD TUNIC.—RETINA. 529 latter. Wlien the pigment is washed off, the processes are of a whitish colour. Third tunic.—The third tunic of the eye is the retina, which is prolonged forwards to the lens by the zonula ciliaris. Dissection.—If, after the preceding dissection, the choroid mem- brane be carefully raised and removed, the eye being kept under water, the retina may be seen very distinctly. The Retina is composed of three layers :— JacoVs membrane is extremely thin, and is seen as a mere film when the freshly dissected eye is suspended in water. Examined by the microscope, it is found to be composed of cells having a tesselated arrangement. Dr. Jacob considers it to be a serous membrane. The Nervous membrane is the expansion of the optic nerve, and forms a thin semi-transparent bluish-white layer, which envelopes the vitreous humour, and extends forward to the commencement of the ciliary processes, where it terminates by an abrupt scalloped margin. According to Treviranus, this layer is composed of cylindrical fibres, * Anterior segment of a transverse section of the globe of the eye, seen from within. 1.

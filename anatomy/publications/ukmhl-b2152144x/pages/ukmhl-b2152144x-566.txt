OSSICULA AUDITUS. 542 The Malleus (hammer) consists of a head, neck, handle (manu- brium)^ and two processes, long (processus gracilis), and short (pro- cessus brevis). The manuhrium is connected with the membrana tympani by its whole length, extending below the central point of that membrane. It lies beneath the mucous layer of the membrane, and serves as a point of attachment to which the radiating fibres of the fibrous layer converge. The long process descends to a groove near the fissura Grlaseri, and gives attachment to the laxator tympani muscle. Into the short process is inserted the tendon of the tensor tympani, and the head of the bone articulates with the incus. The Incus (anvil) is named from an imagined resemblance to an Fig. 186.* * Diagram of the ear. Pinna. Tympanum. Labyrinth. 1. Upper part of the helix. 2. Antihelix. 3. Tragus. 4. Antitragus. 5.

Fenestra rotunda; the dark opening above the ossicxxla leads into the mastoid cells. 13.

140 STERNO-CLAVICULAR LIGAMENTS. 8. Articulation between the carpal bones. 9. Carpo-metacarpal articulation. 10. Metacarpo-phalangeal articulation. 11. Articulation of the phalanges. 1. Sterno-clavicular Articulation.â€”The sterno-clavicular is an arthrodial articulation ; its ligaments are, Anterior sterno-clavicular, Posterior sterno-clavicular, Inter-clavicular, Costo-clavicular (rJiomhoid). Interarticular fibro-cartilage. Two synovial membranes. The anterior' sterno-clavicular ligament is a broad ligamentous layer, extending obliquely downwards and inwards, and covering the anterior aspect of the articulation. This ligament is in relation by its anterior surface with the integument and sternal origin of the sterno-mastoid muscle ; and behind with the interarticular fibro- cartilage and synovial membranes. The posterior sterno-clavicular ligament is a broad fasciculus, covering the posterior surface of the articulation. It is in relation by its anterior surface with the interarticiilar fibro-cartilage and synovial membranes, and behind with the sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscle. The two ligaments are continuous at the upper and lower part of the articulation, so as to form a complete capsule around the joint. The inter-clavicular ligament is a cord-like band which crosses from the extremity of one clavicle to that of the other, and is closely * Ligaments of the sterno-clavicular and costo-stei-nal articulations. 1. An- terior sterno-clavicular ligament. 2. Inter-claviciilar ligament. 3. Costo- clavicular or rhomboid ligament; seen on both sides. 4. The interarticular fibro-cartilage, brought into view by the removal of the anterior and posterior ligaments. 5. Anterior costo-sternal Hgaments of the first and second rib.

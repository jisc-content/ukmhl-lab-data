414 THORACIC DUCT. Fi;]. 155* in this situation. Occa- sionally the thoracic duct bifurcates at the upper part of the thorax into two branches, one of which opens into the point of junction between the right subclavian and jugular vein, whUe the other pro- ceeds to the normal ter- mination of the duct on the left side. In rare in- stances the duct has been found to terminate in the vena azygos, which is its normal destination m some Mammalia. The thoracic duct pre- sents fewer valves in its course than lymphatic ves- sels generally ; at its ter- mination it is provided with a pair of semilunar valves, which prevent the admission of venous blood into its cylinder. Branches. â€”The thoracic duct receives at its com- mencement four or five large lymphatic trunks, * The course and termina- tion of the thoracic duct. 1. Arch of the aorta. 2. Tho- racic aorta. 3. Abdominal aorta; showing its principal branches divided near their origin. 4. Arteria innominata, dividing into right carotid and right subclavian. 5. Left caro- tid. 6. Left subclavian. 7. Su- perior cava, formed by the union of, 8, the two venae innominatse; and these by the junction, 9, of the internal jugular and subclavian vein at each side, 10. Greater vena azygos. 11. Termination of the lesser in the greater vena azygos. 12. Receptaculum chyU; several lymphatic trunks are seen opening into it. 13. Thoracic duct, dividing opposite the middle of the dorsal ver- tebrae into two branches which soon reunite; the course of the duct behind the arch of the aorta and left subclavian artery is shown by a dotted line. 14. The duct making its turn at the root of the neck and receiving several lymphatic trunks previously to terminating iu the posterior aspect of the junction of the internal jugmar and subclavian vein. 15. Termination of the trunk of the ductus lymphaticus dexter.

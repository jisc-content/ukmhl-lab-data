OCCIPITAL BONE. 22 OF THE SKULL. The skull, or superior expansion of the vertebral column, is divisible into two parts, the cranium and the face; the former being adapted, by its form, structure, and strength, to contain and protect the brain, and the latter the chief organs of sense. The Cranium is composed of eight separate bones; viz. the Occipital Bone.—This bone is situated at the posterior part and base of the cranium. It is trapezoid in figure, and divisible into two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. External Surface.—Crossing the middle of the bone transversely, from one lateral angle to the other, is a prominent ridge, the superior * The external surface of the occipital bone. 1. The superior curyed line. 2. The external occipital protuberance. 3. The spine. 4. The inferior curved line. The convexity of the bone in this situation on either side of the spine, is the receptaculum cerehelU. 5. The foramen magnum. 6. The con- dyle of the right side. 7. The posterior condyloid fossa, in which the pos- terior condyloid foramen is found. 8. The anterior condyloid foramen, concealed by the margin of the condyle. 9. The transverse process; this process upon the internal surface of the bone forms the jugular eminence. 10. The notch iu front of the jugular eminence which forms part of the jugular foramen. 11. The basilar process. 12. The rough projections into which the odontoid ligaments are inserted. Occipital, Two parietal, Frontal, Two temporal, Sphenoid, Ethmoid. Fig. 13.*

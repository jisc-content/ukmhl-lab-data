345 ULNAE ARTERY. collateral artery. Near its origin it gives ofif a small branch (more frequently a direct branch of the radial), which inosculates with the superficial palmar arch. The Interossece palmares, three or four in number, are branches of the deep palmar arch; they pass forward upon the interossei muscles, and inosculate with the digital branches of the superficial arch, opposite the heads of the metacarpal bones. The Perforantes, three in number, pass directly backwards between the heads of the dorsal interossei muscles, and inosculate with the dorsal interosseous arteries. The Recurrent branches of the deep palmar arch pass upwards in front of the wrist-joint, and inosculate with the arterial arch formed by the anterior carpal arteries. ULNAR ARTERY. The Ulnar artery (ulnaris; cubitalis), the other and larger division of the brachial, crosses the forearm obliquely to the com- mencement of its middle third; it then runs down the ulnar side of the forearm to the wrist, crosses the annular ligament, and forms the superficial palmar arch (arcus volaris superficialis), which termi- nates by inosculating with the superficialis volse.

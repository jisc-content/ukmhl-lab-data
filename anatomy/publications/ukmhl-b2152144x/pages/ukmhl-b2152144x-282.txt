MUSCLES OP THE HAND. 258 The Flexok brevis pollicis consists of two portions, between which lies the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. The external portion arises' from the trapezium and annular ligament; the internal portion from the trapezoides and os magnum. They are both inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, having a sesamoid bone in each of their tendons to protect the joint.

They pass between the filaments of origin of the hypoglossal nerve in their course, and anastomose with the superior cerebellar arteries. The Transverse branches of the basilar artery supply the pons Fig. 136.* * The circle of Willis. The arteries have references only on one side, on account of their symmetrical distribution. 1.

21 COCCYX. on the side the coccygeus, and behind the gluteus maximus, latis- simus dorsi, longissimus dorsi, sacro-lumbalis, and multifidns spin^. Fiff. 12. The Coccyx {kokkv^, cnckoo, from resembling a cuckoo's beak) is composed of four small pieces, which form the caudal termination of the vertebral column. The superior piece is broad, and expands laterally into two transverse processes; it is sur- mounted by an oval articular surface and two cornua, the former to articu- late with the apex of the sacrum, the latter with the sacral cornua. The lateral wings sometimes become con- nected with the sacrum, and convert the notches for the iifth pair of sacral nerves into foramina. The remaining three pieces diminish in size from above downwards. Development.—By/o-wr centres, one for each piece. Ossification com- mences in the first piece soon after birth; in the second, between five and ten years; in the third, between ten and fifteen; and in the fourth, between fifteen and twenty. The pieces unite at an earlier period than the bodies of the sacrum, the first two pieces first, then the third and fourth, and lastly the second and third. Between forty and sixty years, the coccyx becomes consolidated with the sacrum; this event taking place later in the female than in the male. Articulations.—With the sacrum. Attachment of Muscles.—To ^Aree pairs, and one single muscle; gluteus maximus, coccygeus, posterior fibres of the levator ani, and sphincter ani. * Front view of the coccyx. 1,2,3, 4.

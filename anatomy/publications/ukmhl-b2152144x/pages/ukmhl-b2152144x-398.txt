DORSALIS PEDIS ARTEKY. 374 Fig. 147. -12 the anterior peroneal artery and dorsalis pedis; the internal, be- neath the tendons of the exten- sor proprius poUicis and tibialis anticus, inosculates with branches of the posterior tibial and inter- nal plantar artery. They supply branches to the ankle-joint. The Dorsalis pedis artery is continued forward along the tibial side of the dorsum of the foot, from the ankle to the base of the meta- tarsal bone of the great toe, where it gives off a branch, the dorsalis hallucis, and then dips between the two heads of the first dorsal inter- osseous muscle into the sole of the foot and becomes continuous with the deep plantar arch. Relations.â€”The dorsahs pedis is situated along the outer border of the tendon of the extensor proprius poUicis ; on its fibular side is the innermost tendon of the extensor longus digitorum, and near its ter- mination it is crossed by the inner tendon of the extensor brevis digi- torum. It is accompanied by venae comites, and has the continuation of the anterior tibial nerve to its outer side. * Ajiterior aspect of the leg and foot, showing the anterior tibial and dor- salis pedis artery; the tibialis anticus has been removed. 1.

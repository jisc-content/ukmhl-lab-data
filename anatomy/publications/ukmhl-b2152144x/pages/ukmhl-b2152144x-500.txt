PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE. 476 auricular branch of tlie facial, pinna. tlie other is distributed to the The Pharyngeal nerve arises from the upper part of the superior ganglion and crosses behind the internal carotid artery to the upper border of the middle constrictor, upon which it forms the pharyngeal plexus assisted by branches from the glosso-pharyngeal, superior laryngeal, and sym- pathetic. The pharyngeal plexus is distributed to the muscles and mucous mem- brane of the pharynx. The Superior laryngeal nerve arises from the inferior ganglion and descends behind the internal carotid artery to the opening in the thyro- hyoidean membrane, through which it passes with the supe- rior laryngeal artery, and is distributed to the mucous membrane of the larynx and * Origin and distribution of the eighth pair of nerres. 1, 3. 4.

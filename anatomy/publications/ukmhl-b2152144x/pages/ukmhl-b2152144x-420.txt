VEINS OF THE TRUNK. 396 Fig. 153.* in the formation of tlie supe- rior cava. At the junction of the jugular and subclavian vein it receives from behind the ductus lymphaticus dex- ter, and lower down it has opening into it the riglit in- ternal mammary, and right inferior thyroid vein. The Left vena innomin- ata, considerably longer than the right, extends almost horizontally across the roots of the three great arteries arising from the arch of the aorta, to the right side of the mediastinum, where it unites with the right vena innominata, to constitute the superior vena cava. It is in relation in front with the left sterno-clavi- cular articulation and the first piece of the sternum. At its commencement it receives the thoracic duct which opens into it from behind, and in its course is joined by the left inferior thyroid, left mam- mary, and left superior in- tercostal vein. It also re- ceives some small veins from the mediastinum and thymus gland* There are no valves in the vense innominate. * Veins of the trunk and neck. 1. Superior vena cava. 2.

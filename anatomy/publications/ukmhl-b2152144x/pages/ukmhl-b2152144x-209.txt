185 AURICULAR GROUP, buccinator circumscribes the cavity of the mouth, and with the aid of the tongue keeps the food under the immediate pressure of the teeth. By means of its connexion with the superior constrictor, it shortens the cavity of the pharynx from before backwards, and becomes an important auxiliary in deglutition. The temporal, the masseter, and the internal pterygoid are the bruising muscles, drawing the lower jaw against the upper with great force. The two latter, from the obliquity of their direction, assist the external pterygoid in gxinding the food, by carrying the lower jaw forward upon the upper ; the jaw being brought back again by the deep portion of the masseter and posterior fibres of the temporal. The whole of these muscles, acting in suc- cession, produce a rotatory movement of the teeth upon each other, which, with the direct action of the lower jaw against the upper, effects the proper mastication of the food, 8. Auricular Oroup.—AttoUens aurem, Attrahens aurem, Eetrahens aurem. Dissection,—The three small muscles of the ear may be exposed by removing a square of integument from around the auricula. This operation must be performed with care, otherwise the muscles, which are extremely thin, will be raised with the superficial fascia. They are best dissected by commencing with their tendons, and thence proceeding in the course of their radiating fibres. The Attollens aurem (superior auriculae), [Figs. 184, 185], the largest of the three, is a thin triangular plane of muscular fibres, arising from the lateral portion of the galea aponeurotica and * The two pterygoid muscles. The zygomatic arch and the greater part of the ramus of the lower jaw have been removed, in order to bring these muscles into view. 1. The sphenoid origin of the ezternal pterygoid. 2.

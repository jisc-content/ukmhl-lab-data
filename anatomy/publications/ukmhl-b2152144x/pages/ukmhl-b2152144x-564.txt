540 MUSCLES OF THE PINNA. The Major helicis is a narrow band of muscular fibres situated upon the anterior border of the helix. It arises from the spine of the helix and is inserted into the anterior border of that fold. The Minor helicis is placed upon the anterior extremity (crus) of the helix, at its commencement in the fossa of the concha. The Tragicus is a thin quadrilateral layer of muscular fibres, situated upon the tragus. The Antitragicus arises from the 'antitragus, and is inserted into the posterior surface of the processus caudatus of the helix. The Transversus awiculcB, partly tendinous and partly muscular, extends transversely from the convexity of the concha to that of the helix, on the posterior surface of the pinna. The Obliquus auris (Tod) is a small band of fibres passing between Fig. 185.* * The pinna and its muscles, as seen from behind. After Arnold. 1,1. Border of the helix. 2. Spine of the helix. 3.

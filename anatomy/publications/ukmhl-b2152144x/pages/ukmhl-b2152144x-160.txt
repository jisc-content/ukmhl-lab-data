136 LIGAMENTS OP THE PELVIS. The lumbo-iliac or ilio-lumhar ligament passes from the apex of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra to that part of the crest of the ilium which surmounts the sacro-iliac articulation. It is triangular in form. Fig. 76.* 10. Articulations of the Pelvis.—The ligaments belonging to the articulations of the pelvis are divisible into four groups :—1, those connecting the sacrum and ilium; 2, those passing between the sacrum and ischium; 3, between the sacrum and coccyx; and, 4, between the two pubic hones. 1st, Between the sacrum and ilium. Sacro-iliac anterior, Sacro-iliac posterior. 2nd, Between the sacrum and ischium. Sacro-ischiatic anterior (short), Sacro-ischiatic posterior (long). 3rd, Between the sacrum and coccyx. Sacro-coccygean anterior, Sacro-coccygean posterior. * Ligaments of the pelvis and hip-joint. 1. Lower part of the anterior common ligament of the vertebrae, extending downwards over the front of the sacrum. 2. Lumbo-sacral ligament. 3. Lumbo-ihac hgament. 4. An- terior sacro-ihachgament. 5. Obturator membrane. 6. Poupart's ligament. 7. Gimbernat's hgament. 8. Capsular hgament of the hip-joint. 9. Iho- femoral or accessory hgament.

STRUCTURE OP BONE. 3 Fig. 1 * ture of the basis substance, are collected concentrically around the Haversian canals, and form boundaries to those canals of about of, an inch in thickness. The number of lamellae surrounding each Haversian canal is commonly ten or fifteen, and the diameters of the canals have a medium average of -jj^ of an inch. The can- celli of bone, like its compact substance, have walls which are com- posed of lamellae; and, such is the similarity in structure of the parts of a bone, that the entire bone may be compared to an Haver- sian canal of which the medullary cavity is the magnified channel; and the Haversian canals may be likened to elongated and ramified cancelli. The Haversian canals are smallest near the surface of a bone, and largest near its centre, where they gradually merge into cancelli; by the frequent communications of their branches they form a coarse network in the basis substance. The cells of bone, or corpuscles of Purkinje, are thickly dissemi- nated through the basis substance; they are irregular in size and form, give off numerous minute branching tubuli which radiate from all * Minute structure of bone, drawn with the microscope from nature, by Bagg.

Between the lamellae at the upper part of the figure, several very long cor- puscles vrith their tubuli are seen. In the lower part of the figure, the out- lines of two other canals are given, in order to show their form and mode of arrangement in the entire bone. B 2

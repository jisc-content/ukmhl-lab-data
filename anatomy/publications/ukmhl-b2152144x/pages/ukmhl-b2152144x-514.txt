490 MEDIAN NERVE. The Muscular branches are given off by the nerve at the bend of the elbow ; they are distributed to all the muscles of the anterior aspect of the forearm, with the exception of the flexor carpi ul- naris, and ulnar half of the flexor profundus. The branch to the pronator radii teres sends off re- flected filaments to the elbow- joint. The Anterior interosseous is a large branch accompanying the anterior interosseous artery, and supplying the deep layer of muscles of the forearm ; being lost in the pronator quadratus. The Superficialjmlmar branch arises from the median at about the lower fourth of the forearm: it crosses the annular ligament, and is distributed to the integu- ment of the palm of the hand, and to that of the ball of the thumb. The median nerve at its ter- mination in the palm of the hand is spread out and flattened, and divides into six branches, one muscular and five digital. The muscular branch is dis- tributed to the muscles of the ball of the thumb. The digital branches are thus arranged : tivo pass outwards to the thumb and supply its borders; the third passes along the radial side of the index finger, sending a twig to the first lumbricalis in its * Brachial plexus of nerves with its branches and their distribution. 1.

FIBRES OF THE BRAIN. 449 rounded. For a like reason, the bodies in which this grey substance occurs, are called by the same physiologists ganglia of increase^'" and by other authors simply ganglia. Thus the thalami optici and Fig. 162.* * Base of the brain upon which several sections have been made, showing the distribution of the diverging fibres. 1. Medulla oblongata. 2. One half of the pons VaroUi. 3. Crus cerebri crossed by the optic nerve (4), and spreading out into the hemisphere to form the corona radiata. 5. Optic nerve near its origin; the nerves about the crus cerebri and eerebeUi are the same as in the preceding figure. 6. Olfactory nerve. 7. Corpora albicantia. On the left side of the figure a portion of the brain has been removed to show the distribution of the (fiverging fibres. 8. Fibres of the corpus pyramidale passing through the substance of the pons Varolii. 9. The fibres passing through the thalamus opticus. 10. The fibres passing through the corpus striatum. 11. Their distribution to the hemisphere. 12. The fifth nerve: its two roots may be traced, the one forwards to the fibres of the corpus pyramidale, the other backwards to the fasciculi teretes. 13. The fibres of the corpus pyramidale which pass outwards with the corpus restiforme into the substance of the cerebellum; these are the arctform fibres of SoUy. The fibres referred to are those below the numeral, the numeral itself rests upon the corpus oHvare. 14. A section through one of the hemispheres of the cere- bellum, showing the corpus rhomboideum in the centre of its white sub- stance; the arbor vitse is also seen. 15. The opposite hemisphere of the cerebellum. G G

673 THYMIC FLUID. Fig, 234, The Reservoir is lined in its interior by a vascular mucous mem- brane, wbich is raised into ridges by a layer of ligamentous bands situated beneath it. The liga- mentous bands proceed in various directions, and encircle the open mouths (pores) of the secretory cells and pouches. This liga- mentous layer serves to keep the lobules together and prevents the injurious distention of the cavity. When either gland is carefully unravelled by removing the fibro- cellular capsule and vessels, and dissecting away the reticulated cellular tissue which retains the lobules in contact, the reservoir, from being folded in a serpentine manner upon itself, admits of being drawn out into a lengthened tubular cord,f around which the lobules are clustered in a spiral planner, and resemble knots upon h, cord, or a string of beads. The reservoir, pouches, and cells, contain a white fluid *' like chyle," or ^' like cream, but vsdth a small admixture of red globules." In an examination of the thymic fluid which I lately (1840) made, with a Powell microscope magni- fying 600 times linear measure, I observed that the corpuscles were very numerous, smaller than the blood particles, globular and oval in form, irregular in outline, variable in size, and provided with a small central nucleus. In the human foetus this fluid has been found by Sir Astley Cooper in too small proportion to * The course and termination of the " absorbent duets" of the thymus of the calf; from one of Sir Astley Cooper's preparations. 1. The two internal jugular veins. 2. The superior vena cava. 3. The thoracic duct, dividing into two branches, which reunite previously to their termination in the root of the left jugular vein. 4. The two thymic duets; that on the left side opens into the thoracic duct, and that on the right into the root of the right jugular vein. t See the plates in Sir Astley Cooper's work. X X

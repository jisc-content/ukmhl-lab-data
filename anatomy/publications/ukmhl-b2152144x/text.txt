UKiVEASilirtif UEDSTO Sir benjamin COLLINS BUODIE, Bart., F.E.S. SERJEAKT-STJE&EOM- TO THE QUEEN, MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE, IN ADMIRATION OF THE HIGH ATTAINMENTS I WHICH HAVE PLACED HIM IN THE PIEST RANK OF HIS PROFESSION, THIS WOEK IS RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED.PEEFACE. In presenting for the Sixth time a new Edition of the Anatomist's Yade Mecum to my brethren of the pro- fession of medicine, it gives me much satisfaction and pleasure to have the opportunity of announcing that, in the preparation of the present Edition, I have re- ceived the aid of a distinguished Professor of Medicine of northern Europe, Andreas Retzius, M.D., F.E^ Acad. S., Master of Surgery, Dean, and Professor of Anatomy in the Poyal Caroline Institute of Stockholm; a man justly renowned in the science of our art. The assistance of Professor Petzius was the more gratifying to me, as being the spontaneous offering of a great and distinguished man of science to a humble but zealous fellow-labourer; and his approbation of the book has acted as a stimulus to me to make the present Edition not unworthy of the praise which, in his correspondence, he has kindly bestowed upon it. " I use your Anatomist's Yade Mecum," he observes, " for my students in the dissecting room. It has be- come my favourite manual for young students; for I find that by it they get a clearer and quicker insightVI PREFACE. into the study of Anatomy, than by any other book. These are my reasons for interesting myself in its suc- cess, and for contributing my remarks for its emenda- tion." In pursuance of these observations, Dr. Retzius had conveyed to me an interleaved copy of the work con- taining many notes for its improvement; and, further- more, took the trouble of sending to me, from across the seas, a preparation of the ligaments of the foot, shoAving the ligament to which he has given the name of ligamentum fundiforme (page 30-5). More deeply cherished is the promise conveyed in the following pas- sage: "If the Almighty God will continue to bless me with health and life for some years longer, I will assist you in revising every new Edition, and intro- ducing all those new discoveries in anatomy which may be of use to the Students of Medicine." One of his letters contains the following question : " Do you not think that some few figures representing the villi, the epithelium, and the follicles of the mucous membrane of the intestinal canal would be useful, since that structure plays so important a part in disease?' This question is responded to by the ten figures num- bered 206 to 216. With the exception of figure 207, which is copied from Henle, these figures were drawn by myself, with the aid of the camera lucida, and will suggest to the student some points of novelty in regard to the structure of the intestinal mucous membrane. I may refer particularly to figure 214, showing the microscopic appearance of a patch of Peyer's glands; and figure 216, the muciparous glands of the small intes- tine. While thus acknowledging the assistance given toPREFACE. vii me by the great Scandinavian Professor, it may not be out of place here to put on record an act of liberality, in connexion with this book, from another foreign source, namely, from the well known medical publishers of Philadelphia, Messrs. Blanchard and Lea. The following extract from a letter addressed to me by them, and bearing date April 4, 1854, will explain the incident to which I now refer. " You may perhaps be acquainted with the name of our house as having published in this country your works on Anatomy and Diseases of the Skin. When English works which we issue are successful, it always affords us pleasure to make the Author an acknow- ledgment more substantial, if not more gratifying, than the transatlantic reputation thus obtained; and we accordingly take pleasure in handing you the an- nexed draft, which we trust you will do us the favour to accept." With the above encouraging passages in the annals of the Anatomist's Yade Mecum I now conclude, trust- ing that my reader, and those for whom the book was specially written, may find no reason to utter a judg- ment less favourable than the foreign reputation and wide circulation of the volume would seem to justify. 17, Henrietta Street, Cavendish Square,CONTENTS.

The bones are the organs of support of tlie animal frame ; they give firmness and strength to the entire fabric, afford points of con- nexion to the numerous muscles, and bestow individual character upon the body. In the limbs they are hollow cylinders, admirably calculated by their conformation and structure to resist violence and support weight. In the trunk and head, they are flattened and arched, to protect cavities and provide an extensive surface for attach- ment. In some situations they present projections of variable length, which serve as levers; and in others are grooved into smooth surfaces, which act as pulleys for the passage of tendons. Moreover, besides supplying strength and solidity, they are equally adapted, by their numerous divisions and mutual apposition, to fulfil every movement which may tend to the preservation of the creature, or be conducive to his welfare. According to the latest analysis by Berzelius, bone is composed of about one-third of animal substance, which is almost completely reducible to gelatine by boiling, and of'two-thirds of earthy and alkaline salts. The special constituents of bone are present in the following proportions:— Cartilage . . . . . 32*17 parts.

Bones are divisible into three classes :—Long, flat, and irregular. The Long bones are found principally in the limbs, and consist of a shaft and two extremities. The shaft is cylindrical or prismoid in form, dense and hard in texture, and hollowed in the interior into a medullary canal. The extremities are broad and expanded, to articu- late, with adjoining bones; and in internal structure are cellular or cancellous. Upon the exterior of the bone are processes and rough surfaces for the attachment of muscles, and foramina for the trans- mission of vessels and nerves. The character of long bones is, there- fore, their general type of structure and their divisibility into a central portion and extremities, and not so much their length; for there, are certain long bones, as the second phalanges of the toes, which are less than a quarter of an inch in length, and which in some instances exceed in breadth their longitudinal axis. The long bones are, the clavicle, humerus, radius and ulna, femur, tibia and fibula, meta- carpal bones, metatarsal, phalanges, and ribs. Flat bones are composed of two layers of dense bone with an inter- mediate cellular structure, and are divisible into surfaces, borders, angles, and processes. They are adapted to inclose cavities; have processes upon their surface for the attachment of muscles; and are perforated by foramina, for the passage of nutrient vessels to their cells, and for the transmission of vessels and nerves. They articulate with long bones by means of smooth surfaces plated with cartilage, and with each other either by fibro-cartUaginous tissue, as at the symphysis pubis ; or by suture, as in the bones of the skull. The two condensed layers of the bones of the skull are named, tables ; and the intermediate cellular structure, diploe. The flat bones are, the occipital, parietal, frontal, nasal, lachrymal, vomer, sternum, scapulae, and ossa innominata. The Irregular bones include all that remain after the long and the flat bones have been selected. They are essentially irregular ia their form, in some parts flat, in others short and thick; and are con- structed on the same general principles as other bones; they have an exterior dense, and an interior more or less cellular. The bones of this class are, the temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid, superior maxil- lary, inferior maxillary, palate, inferior turbinated, hyoid, vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, carpal, tarsal, and sesamoid bones, the latter includ- ing the patellae. Structure of Bone.—Bone is a dense, compact, and homogeneous substance (basis substance) filled -with minute cells (corpuscles of Purkinje), which are scattered numerously through its structure. The basis substance of bone is subfibrous and obscurely lamellated, the lamellae being concentric in long and parallel in flat bones; it is traversed in all directions, but especially in the longitudinal axis, by branching and inosculating canals (Haversian canals), which give passage to vessels and nerves, and in certain situations the lamellae separate from each other, and leave between them areolar spacesSTRUCTURE OP BONE. 3 Fig. 1 * ture of the basis substance, are collected concentrically around the Haversian canals, and form boundaries to those canals of about of, an inch in thickness. The number of lamellae surrounding each Haversian canal is commonly ten or fifteen, and the diameters of the canals have a medium average of -jj^ of an inch. The can- celli of bone, like its compact substance, have walls which are com- posed of lamellae; and, such is the similarity in structure of the parts of a bone, that the entire bone may be compared to an Haver- sian canal of which the medullary cavity is the magnified channel; and the Haversian canals may be likened to elongated and ramified cancelli. The Haversian canals are smallest near the surface of a bone, and largest near its centre, where they gradually merge into cancelli; by the frequent communications of their branches they form a coarse network in the basis substance. The cells of bone, or corpuscles of Purkinje, are thickly dissemi- nated through the basis substance; they are irregular in size and form, give off numerous minute branching tubuli which radiate from all * Minute structure of bone, drawn with the microscope from nature, by Bagg.

B 24 STRUCTURE OP BONE. « parts of their circumference, and in the dried state of the bone con- tain merely the remains of membranous cells and some calcareous salts.* In the living bone the cells and their tubuli are probably filled with a nutritive fluid holding calcareous salts in solution. The form of the cells is oval or round, and more or less flattened; their long diameter corresponds with the long axis of the bone, and their tubuli cross the direction of the lamellae, and constitute a very deli- cate network in the basis substance, by communicating with each other and with the tubuli of neighbouring cells. The tubuli of the cells nearest the Haversian canals terminate upon the internal surface of those passages. The size of the cells varies in extreme measure- ment from -gVrrr to of an inch in their long diameter, an ordin- ary average being xwtt > '^^^ breadth of the oval cells is about one- half or one-third their length, and their thickness one-half their breadth. They are situated between the lamellae, to which circum- stance they owe their compressed form. In the fresh state, bones are invested by a dense fibrous membrane, the periosteum, which covers every part of their surface with the exception of the articular extremities, the latter being coated by a thin layer of cartilage. The periosteum of the bones of the skull is termed ^:)en'cmmww/ and the analogous membrane of external car- tilages, perichondrium. Lining the interior of the medullary canal of long bones, the Haversian canals, the cells of the cancelli, and the cells of the flat and irregular bones, is the medullaiy membrane, which acts as an internal periosteum. It is through the medium of the vessels ramifying in these membranes that the changes required by nutrition occur in bones, and the secretion of medulla into their interior is effected. The medullary canal. Haversian canals and cells of long bones, and the cells of other bones, are filled with a yellowish oily substance, the medulla, which is contained in a loose cellular tissue formed by the medullary membrane. Development of Bone.—To explain the development of bone it is necessary to inform the student that all organized bodies, whether belonging to the vegetable or animal kingdom, are developed primor- dially from minute vesicles. These vesicles, or, as they are com- monly termed, cells, are composed of a thin membrane, containing a fluid or granular matter, and a small rounded mass, the nucleus, around which the cell was originally formed. Moreover, the nucleus generally contains one or more small round granules, the nucleolus, or nucleoli. From cells having this structure all the tissues of the body are elaborated; the ovum itself originally presented this simple form, and the embryo at an early period is wholly composed of such nu- cleated cells. In their relation to each other, cells may be isolated and independent, as is exemplified in the corpuscles of the blood, * Miiller and Henle conceived that the bone cells and tubuli were the prin- cipal seat of the calcareous matter. Hence they were named caldgerous cells aud tubuli.5 DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. chyle, and lympli; secondly, they may cohere by their surfaces and borders, as in the epiderma and epithelium; thirdly, they may be connected by an intermediate substance, which is then termed inter- cellular, as in cartilage and bone; and, fourthly, they may unite with each other in rows, and upon the removal, by liquefaction, of their adherent surfaces, be converted into hollow tubuli. In the latter mode capillary vessels are formed, as also are the tubuli of nerves. One of the properties of cells may also be adverted to in this place; it is that of reproducing similar cells in their interior. In this case the nucleoli become the nuclei of the secondary cells, and as the latter increase in size the membrane of the primary or parent cell is lost. Bone, in its earliest stage, is composed of an assemblage of these minute cells, which are soft and transparent, and are disposed within the embryo in the site of the future skeleton. From the resemblance which the soft bone-tissue bears to jelly, this has been termed the gelatinous stage of osteo-genesis. As development advances, the cells, heretofore loosely connected together, become separated by the interposition of a transparent intercellular substance, which, at first fluid, gradually becomes hard and condensed. The cartilaginous stage of osteo-genesis is now established, and cartilage is shown to consist of a transparent basis-substance, having minute cells dis- seminated at pretty equal distances through its structure. Coincident with the formation of cartilage is the development of vascular canals in its substance, the canals being formed by the union of the cells in rowfe, and the subsequent liquefaction of their adhering sur&ces. The change which next ensues is the concentration of the vascular canals towards some one point; for example, the centre of the shaft in a long, or the mid-point of a flat bone, and here the punctum ossificationis, or centre of ossification, is established. What deter- mines the vascular concentration now alluded to, is a question not easily solved, but that it takes place is certain, and the vascular punctum is the most easily demonstrable of all the phenomena of ossification. During the formation of the punctum ossificationis, changes begin to be apparent in the cartilage cells. Originally they are simple nu- cleated cells (g-fnnr Trnnr of v^oh in diameter), having a rounded form. As growth proceeds, they become elongated in their figure, and it is then perceived that each cell contains two and often three nucleoli, around which smaller cells are in progress of formation. If we examine them nearer to the punctum ossificationis, we find that the young or secondary cells have each attained the size of the parent cell (2-^013" of inch), the membrane of the parent cell has disappeared, and the young cells are separated to a short distance by freshly effused intercellular substance. Nearer still to the punc- tum ossificationis a more remarkable change has ensued, the energy of cellule reproduction has augmented with proximity to the ossifying point, and each cell, in place of producing two, gives birth to four,6 DEVELOPMENT OP BONE. Fig. 2* 0e ,.1 •J ^^^^^^^^ five, or six young cells, which rapidly destroy the parent membrane and attain a greater size (two- of an inch) than the parent cell, each Fig. 3.t cell being, as in the previous case, separated to a slight extent from its neighbour by intercellular substance. By one other repetition of the same process, each cell producing four, or five, or six young cells, * Figures illustrative of the development of bone; they are magnified 155 times, and drawn with the camera lucida. a.

These clusters become larger towards the right of the figure, and their cells more numerous and larger, yb5q of ^ inch, long diameter.DEVELOPMENT OP BONE. 7 a cluster is formed, containing from thirty to fifty cells. These clusters lie in immediate relation with the punctum ossificationis; they are oval in figure (about ^hr of i^ch in length by in breadth), and placed in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the bone. The cells composing the cluster lie transversely with regard to its axis. In the first instance they are closely compressed, but by degrees are parted by a thin layer of intercellular substance, and each cluster is separated from neighbouring clusters by a broader Fig. 4* i ^Sijer (^^\ 0 of an inch) of intercellular substance. Such are the changes which occur in cartilage preparatory to the formation of bone. Ossification is accomplished by the formation of very fine and deli- cate fibres within the intercellular substance : this process commences at the punctum ossificationis, and extends from that point through every part of the bone, in a longitudinal in long, and in a radiated direction in flat bones. Starting from the punctum ossificationis, the fibres embrace each cluster of cells, and then send branches between the individual cells of each group. In this manner the network, characteristic of bone, is formed, while the cells by their conjunction constitute the permanent areolse and Haversian canals. With a high * The same cartilage at the seat of ossification; the clusters of cells are arranged in columns; the intercellular spaces between the columns being 3^50 of an inch in breadth. To the right of the figure osseous fibres are seen occupying the interceUiilar spaces, at first boimding the clusters laterally, then splitting them longitudinally, and encirchng each separate cell. The greater opacity of the right-hand border is due to a threefold cause, the in- crease of osseous fibres, the opacity of the contents of the cells, and the mul- tiphcation of oil-globules. In the lower part of the figure some attempt has been made to show the texture of the cells.8 PERIODS OF OSSIFICATION. magnifying power, tlie deKcate ossific fibres here alluded to are seen themselTes to be composed of minute cells having an elliptical form and central nuclei. These cells attract into their interior the cal- careous salts of the blood, and their nuclei become developed, as I believe, into the future corpuscles of Purkinje. It is possible also that some of the cartilage cells become corpuscles of Purkinje in the fully developed bone. During the progTess of the phenomena above described, the contents of the cells undergo certain changes. At first, their contents are transparent, then they become granular, and still later opaque, from the presence of amorphous matter mingled with nuclei, nucleoli, and the remains of secondary cells. In the latter state they also contain, an abundance of minute oil globules. These latter increase in size as the ossific changes advance, and in the newly-formed osseous areolae they are very numerous, and have attained the ordinary size of adi- pose cells. Cartilaginification is complete in the human embryo at about the sixth week; and the first point of ossification is observed in the clavicle at about the seventh week. Ossification commences at the centre, and thence proceeds towards the surface; in flat bones the osseous tissue radiates between two membranes from a central point towards the periphery, in short bones from a centre towards the circumference, and in long bones from a central portion, diaphysis, towards a secondary centre, epiphysis, situated at each extremity. Large processes, as the trochanters, are provided with a distinct centre of development, which is named apophysis. The growth of bone in length takes place at the extremity of the diaphysis, and in bulk by fresh deposition on the surface; while the medullary canal is formed and increased by absorption from within. The period of ossification is different in different bones; the order of succession may be thus arranged :— During the fifth week, ossification commences in the clavicle, lower jaw, and upper jaw. During the sixth week, in the femur, humerus, tibia, radius, and ulna. During the seventh and eighth weeks, in the fibula, frontal, occi- pital, sphenoid, ribs, parietal, temporal, nasal, vomer, palate, verte- brae, first three pieces of sacrum, malar, metacarpus, metatarsus, third phalanges of the hands and feet, and ilium.

The entire osseous framework of the body constitutes the skeleton, which in the adult man is composed of two hundred and forty-six distinct bones. They may be thus arranged :— Head ....... 8 Ossicula auditus ..... 6 Face 14 Teeth 32 i Vertebral column, including sacrum and coccyx 26 Os hyoides, sternum, and ribs . . .26 Upper extremities. . . . .64 Lower extremities . . . . .62 Sesamoid bones ..... 8 246 The skeleton is divisible into: 1.

The pelvic arch and lower extremities.10 VERTEBRAL COLUMN, The vertebral column is the first and only rudiment of internal skeleton in the lower Vertebrata, and constitutes the type of that great division of the animal kingdom. It is also the first developed portion of the skeleton in man, and the centre around which all the other parts are produced. In its earliest formation it is a simple cartilaginous cylinder, surrounding and protecting the primitive trace of the nervous system; hut, as it advances in growth and organi- sation, it becomes divided into distinct pieces, which constitute vertehrcB. The vertebrse admit of a division into true and false. The true vertebrae are twenty-four in number, and are classed, according to the three regions of the trunk which they occupy, into cervical, dorsal, and lumbar. The false vertebrae consist of nine pieces united into two bones, the sacrum and coccyx. The arrangement of the vertebrse may be better comprehended by means of the accompanying table:— ( 7 Cervical, True vertebrse 24 | 12 Dorsal, ( 5 Lumbar. False vertebrse 9 | ^ Coc^x' Characters of a Vertebra.—A vertebra consists of a body, two laminse, a spinous process, two transverse processes, and four articular processes. The body is the solid part of the vertebra; and, by its articulation with adjoining vertebrae, gives strength and support to the trunk. It is flattened above and below, convex in front, and slightly concave behind. Its anterior surface is constricted around the middle, and pierced by a number of small openkigs which give passage to nutritious vessels. Upon its posterior surface is a single irregxdar opening, or several, for the exit of the venae basis vertebrae. The lamince commence upon the sides of the posterior part of the body of the vertebra by two ^ec?ic?es; they then expand; and, arching backwards, enclose a foramen which serves for the protection of the spinal cord. The upper and lower borders of the laminae are rough for the attachment of the ligamenta subflava. The concavities above and below the pedicles are the intervertebral notches. The spinous process stands backwards from the angle of union of the lamiace. It is the succession of these projecting processes along the middle line of the back, that has given rise to the common designation of the vertebral column, the spine. The use of the spinous process is for the attachment of muscles. The transverse processes project one atCERVICAL VERTEBRA. each side from the laminge of the vertebra; they also are intended for the attachment of muscles. The articular four in. number, stand upwards and downwards from the laminae, to arti- culate with the vertebra above and below. Cervical Vertebrce.—In a cer- vical vertebra the body is smaller than in the other regions ; it is thicker before than behind, broad from side to side, concave on the upper surface, and convex below; so that, when articu- lated, the vertebrae lock the one into the other. The laminm are narrow and long, and the included spinal foramen large and triangular. The superior in- tervertebral notches are slightly deeper than the inferior; the inferior being the broadest. The spinous process is short and bifid at the extremity, increasing in length from the fourth to the seventh. The transverse processes are also short and bifid, and deeply grooved along the upper surface for the cervical nerves. Piercing the base of the transverse process is the vertebral foramen, f which gives passage to the vertebral artery and vein, and vertebral plexus of nerves. The transverse processes in this region are formed by two small developments, which proceed, the one from the side of the body, the other from the pedicle of the lamina, and unite near their extremities to enclose the circular area of the vertebral foramen. The anterior of these developments is the rudiment of a cervical rib; and the posterior, the analogue of the transverse processes in the dorsal region. The extremities of these developments are the anterior and posterior tubercles of the trans- verse process. The articular processes are oblique; the superior look- ing upwards and backwards; the inferior, downwards and forwards. There are three peculiar vertebrae in the cervical region:—The first, or atlas; the second, or axis; and the seventh, or vertebra prominens. The Atla^ (named from supporting the head) is a simple ring of * A central cervical vertebra, seen upon its upper surface. 1.

The anterior arch has a tubercle on its anterior surface, for the attach- ment of the longus colli muscle; and on its posterior aspect is a smooth surface, for articulation with the odontoid process of the axis. The ])osterior arch is longer and more slender than the anterior, and flattened from above downwards; at its mid- dle is a rudimentary spinous process; and upon its upper surface, near the articular pro- cesses,ashallowgroovet at each side, which re- presents a superior in- tervertebral notch, and supports the vertebral artery, (just before its st cervical nerve. The intervertebral notches are peculiar, from being situated behind the articular processes, instead of before them as in the other vertebrse. The transverse processes are remarkably large and long, and pierced by the foramen for the vertebral artery. The articular processes are situated upon the most bulky and strongest part of the atlas. The superior are oval and concave, and look inwards, so as to form a kind of cup for the condyles of the occipital bone, and are adapted to the nodding movements of the head; the inferior are circular, and nearly horizontal, to permit of the rotatory movements. Upon the inner face of the lateral mass which supports the articular processes, is a small tubercle at each side, to which the extremities of the transverse ligament are attached, a ligament which divides the ring of the atlas into two unequal segments; the smaller and anterior, for receiving the odontoid process of the axis; the larger and posterior, to give passage to the spinal cord and its membranes. The Axis (vertebra dentata) is so named from having a process shaped like a tooth upon which the head turns as on a pivot. The hody is of large size, and supports a strong process, the odontoid, which rises perpendicularly from its upper surface. The odon- toid process presents two articulating surfaces; one on its anterior * The upper surface of the atlas. 1. The anterior tubercle projecting from the anterior arch. 2.

Upon each side of its apex is a pig^ 7_* rough depression, for the attach- ment of the alar ligaments ; and running down from its base on the anterior surface of the body of the vertebra a vertical ridge, with a depression at each side for the at- tachment of the longus colli muscle. The laminoi are large and strong, and unite posteriorly to form a long and bifid spinous process, which is concave beneath. The transverse processes are rudimentary, not bifid, and project only so far as to enclose the vertebral foramen, which is directed obliquely outwards in- stead of perpendicularly as in the other vertebrae. The superior arti- culating processes are situated upon the body of the vertebra on each side of the odontoid process. They are circular and nearly hori- zontal, having a slight inclination outwards. The inferior articu- lating processes look downwards and forwards, as do the same pro- cesses in the other cervical vertebrge. The superior intervertebral notch is remarkably shallow, and lies behind the articular process as in the atlas. The lower surface of the body is convex, and is received into the concavity upon the upper surface of the third vertebra. The Vertebra prominens, or seventh cervical, approaches in cha- racter to the upper dorsal vertebrae. It has received its designation from having a very long spinous process, which is single and termi- nated by a tubercle, and forms a projection on the back part of the neck; to the extremity of this process the ligamentum nuchse is attached. The transverse processes are but slightly grooved along the upper surface, have each a small foramen for the transmission of the vertebral vein, and present only a rudimentary bifurcation at their extremity. Sometimes the anterior tubercle represents a small but distinct rib.

The pedicles are strong, and the lamince broad and thick; the spinal foramen small and round, and the inferior intervertebral notch of large size, the superior can scarcely be said to exist. The spinous process is long, prismoid, directed very obliquely downwards, and terminated by a tubercle. The trans- verse processes arelarge and strong, and di- rected obliquely back- wards. Upon the an- terior and superior aspect of their sum- mits is a small facet for the articulation of the tubercle of a rib. The articular processes are vertical, the superior facing directly' backwards, the inferior directly forwards. The peculiar vertebrae in the dorsal region are, the first, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. The first dorsal vertebra approaches very closely in character to the last cervical. The body is broad from side to side, and concave above. The superior articular pro- cesses are oblique, and the spinous process horizontal. It has an entire articular surface for the first rib, and a half surface for the second. The ninth dorsal vertebra has only one half articular sur- face at each side. The tenth has a single entire articular surface at each side. The eleventh and ttuelfth have each a single entire ar- ticular surface at each side; they approach in character to the lumbar vertebrae; their transverse processes are very short, trifid at their summits, and have no articulation with the corresponding ribs. The transverse processes of the twelfth dorsal vertebra are rudi- mentary, and its inferior articular processes look outwards. Lumbar Vertebrce.—These are the largest pieces of the vertebral column. The body is broad and large, and thicker before than behind. The pedicles very strong; the laminae short, thick, and broad; the inferior intervertebral notches very large, and the spinal/orame^t large and oval. The spinous process is thick and broad. The transverse processes (costiform processes) are slender, * A lateral view of a dorsal vertebra. 1. The body. 2,2. Articular facets for the heads of ribs. 3. The pedicle. 4.

The superior articular 2^rocesses are concave, and look backwards and inwards; the inferior convex, look forwards and outwards. Projecting backwards and upwards from the su- ■ * perior articular process ^5'- 9- is a short and flat- tened tubercle or pos- terior transverse pro- cess, and in a strongly marked vertebra there is not unfrequently at the base of this a smaller tubercle which has a direction down- wards. The last lum- bar vertebra differs from the rest in hav- ing the body very much bevelled posteriorly, so as to be thick in front and thin behind, and the transverse process thick and large. General Considerations.—Viewed as a whole, the vertebral column represents two pyramids applied base to base, the superior being formed by all the vertebrae from the second cervical to the last lumbar, and the inferior by the sacrum and coccyx. Examined more attentively, it will be seen to be composed of four irregular pyramids, applied to each other by their smaller extremities and by their bases. The smaller extremity of the uppermost pyramid is formed by the axis, or second cervical vertebra; and its base, by the first dorsal. The second pyramid is inverted; having its base at the first dorsal, and the smaller end at the fourth. The third pyramid commences at the fourth dorsal, and gradually enlarges to the fifth lumbar. The fourth pyramid is formed by the sacrum and coccyx. The bodies of the vertebrae are broad in the cervical region; nar- rowed almost to an angle in the middle of the dorsal, and again broad in the lumbar region. The arches are broad and imbricated in the cervical and dorsal regions, the inferior border of each over- lapping the superior of the next; in the lumbar region an interval is left between them. A considerable interval exists between the cranium and atlas, and another between the last lumbar vertebra and sacrum. The sjnnous processes are horizontal in the cervical, and become gradually oblique in the upper part of the dorsal region. In the middle of the dorsal region they are nearly vertical and imbricated, * A lateral \'iew of a lumbar vertebra. 1. The body. 2. The pedicle. 3. The superior intervertebral notch. 4.

The transverse processes developed in their most rudimentary form in the axis, gradually increase in length to the first dorsal vertebra. In the dorsal region they project ob- liquely backwards, and diminish suddenly in length in the eleventh and twelfth vertebras, where they are very small. In the lumbar region they increase in length to the middle vertebra, and again subside to the last. The transverse processes consist essentially of two parts, the anterior of which in the dorsal region is the rib, while the posterior retains the name of transverse process. In the cervical region these two elements are quite apparent, both by their different points of attachment to the vertebra, and by the vertebral foramen which divides them at their base. In the lumbar region the so-called transverse processes are in reality lumbar ribs, while the transverse processes will be found behind them in a rudimentary state, de- veloped, like the true transverse processes in the cervical region, from the superior articular processes. When the anterior and pos- terior transverse processes are examined in relation with each other, they will be observed to converge; if they were prolonged they would unite as in the cervical region and enclose a foramen, or they would rest in contact as in the dorsal region, or become consolidated as in the formation of the sacrum. Moreover, the posterior transverse processes are directed upwards, and if they were prolonged, they would come into contact with a small tubercle which is found at the base of the posterior transverse process (in strongly marked vertebrae) in the vertebra above. This junction would form a posterior inter- vertebral foramen, as actually occurs in the sacrum. In brief, the lumbar vertebrae exhibit those transitional changes which are calcu- lated, by an easy gradation, to convert separate vertebrae into a solid bone. The transverse processes of the eleventh and twelfth dorsal vertebrae are interesting in a transcendental point of view, as exhibiting a tendency, which exists obscurely in all the rest, to trifurcate. Now, supposing these three branches to be lengthened in order to fulfil their purposes, the anterior would constitute the articTilation or union with a rib, while the superior and inferior would join similar branches in the vertebra above and below, and form a posterior intervertebral foramen. The intervertebral foramina formed by the juxtaposition of the intervertebral notches are smallest in the cervical region, and gradu- ally increase to the last lumbar. On either side of the spinous pro- cesses, and extending the whole length of the column, is the verte- bral groove, which is shallow and broad in the cervical, and deeper and narrower in the dorsal and lumbar regions. It lodges the prin- cipal muscles of the back. Viewed from the side, the vertebral column presents several curves, the principal of which is situated in the dorsal region, the concavity looking forwards. In the cervical and lumbar regions the columnDEVELOPMENT OP VERTEBKiE. 17 is convex in front; and in the pelvis an anterior concave curve is formed by the sacrum and coccyx. Besides the antero-posterior curves, a slight lateral curve exists in the dorsal region, having its convexity towards the right side. Development.—The vertebrae are developed by three primary and five secondary centres or epiphyses. The primary centres are, one for each lamella, and one for the body; the epiphyses, one for the apex of the spinous process, one for that of each transverse process, and one for the upper and under surface of the body. Exceptions to this mode of development are met with in the atlas, axis, vertebra prominens, and lumbar vertebras. The atlas has four centres : one for each lateral mass, one (sometimes two) for the anterior arch, and. one for the centre of the posterior arch. The a^is has five : one (sometimes two) for the body, two for the odontoid process, appear- ing side by side in its base, and one for each lamella. The vertebra prominens has two additional centres for the anterior or costal seg- ments of the transverse processes, and the lumbar vertebrce two for the posterior segments of the transverse processes. The primary centres of the vertebrae make their appearance during the seventh or eighth week of embryonic existence, the lamella being somewhat in advance of that for the body. From the lamella are produced the spinous, transverse, and articular processes, and the sides of the body; they unite, to complete the arch, one year after birth, and with the body during the fifth year. The epiphyses for the extremities of the spinous and transverse processes, make their appearance at fifteen or sixteen, and become united between twenty and t-vi^enty-five. The epiphyses of the body are somewhat later in appearance, and are consolidated between the periods of twenty-five and thirty years of age. The ossific centres for the lateral masses of the atlas appear at the same time with those of the other vertebrae; they unite pos- teriorly at the end of the second year, by the intervention of the centre for the posterior arch. The one or two centres of the anterior arch appear during the first year, and become consolidated with the lateral pieces during the fifth or sixth year. The axis developes its lateral pieces at the same time with the rest of the vertebrae; they join posteriorly soon after birth, and with the body diiring the fourth or fifth year. The centres for the body and odontoid process appear during the sixth month, and are consolidated during the third year. The body of the axis is more largely developed at birth than that of the other vertebras. The costal segments of the vertebra prominens appear during the second month, and be- come united to the body at the fifth or sixth year. These processes sometimes remain permanently separate, and constitute a cervical rib. The transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra has some- times a distinct centre, which may remain permanently separate, in that case forming a lumbar rib. The ossification of the arches of the vertebra commences from 0SACRUM 18 al)ove, and proceeds gradually downwards; hence arrest of develop- ment gives rise to spina bifida, generally in the loins. Ossification of the bodies, on the contrary, commences from the centre, and proceeds from that point towards the extremities of the column; hence imper- fection of the bodies occurs either in the upper or lower vertebrse. Attachment of Muscles.—To the atlas are attached nine pairs of muscles; the longus colli, rectus anticus minor, rectus lateralis, rectus posticus minor, obliquus superior and inferior, splenius colli, levator anguli scapulae, and first intertransversales. To the axis are attached eleven pairs; viz. the longus colli, inter- transversales, obliquus inferior, rectus posticus major, interspinales, semi-spinalis colli, multifidus spinae, levator anguli scapulae, splenius colli, transversalis colli, and scalenus posticus. To the remaining rertebrce collectively, thirty pairs and one single muscle; viz. posteriorly, the trapezius, latissimus dorsi, levator angiili scapulae, rhomboideus minor and major, serratus posticus superior and inferior, splenius, sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, spinalis dorsi, cervicalis ascendens, transversalis colli, trachelo-mas- toideus, complexus, semispinal! s dorsi and colli, multifidus spinse, interspinales, intertransversales, levatores costarum : anteriorly, the rectus anticus major, longus colli, scalenus anticus and posticus, psoas magnus, psoas parvus, quadratus lumborum, diaphragm, ob- liquus internus and transversalis. The Sacrum is a triangular bone, situated at the lower extremity of the vertebral column, and formed by the con- solidation of five false ver- tebrae. It is divisible into an anterior and posterior surface, two lateral and a superior border, and an inferior extremity. The anterior surface is concave, and marked by four transverse lines, which indicate its original constitution of five sepa- rate pieces. At the ex- tremities of these lines, on each side, are the four anterior sacral foramina, which diminish in size from above downwards, * The sacrum seen upon its anterior surface. 1,1.

The projection of the superior piece is the sacro-vertebral angle or promontory. The posterior surface is narrower than the anterior and convex. Upon the middle line is a rough crest formed by the rudiments of four spinous processes, the fifth remaining undeveloped and exposing the lower termination of the sacral canal. Immediately external to and parallel with the median crest, is a range of five small tubercles which represent the articular processes of the true vertebrae; beyond these is a shallow groove in which the four posterior sacral foramina open, and farther outwards, a range of -five tubercles corre- sponding with the poste- rior transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. The lowest pair of the articular tubercles bound on each side the termination of the sacral canal, and send each a process downwards to articulate with the coc- cyx. The two descending processes are the sacral cornua. The posterior sa- cral foramina are smaller than the anterior, and transmit the posterior sa- cral nerves. Of the pos- terior transverse tubercles the first corresponds with the angle of the superior border of the bone; the second is small, and enters into the formation of the sacro-iliac articulation; the tliird is large, and gives attachment to the oblique sacro-iliac ligament; the fowrth and fifth are smaller, and serve for the attachment of the sacro- ischiatic ligaments.

On the mperior border, in the middle line, is an oval articular surface, which cor- responds with the under part of the body of the last lumbar vertebra; and on each side a broad triangular surface, which supports the lumbo-sacral nerve and psoas magnus muscle. Immediately behind the vertebral articular surface is the triangular entrance of the sacral canal; and on each side of this opening an articular process, which looks backwards and inwards, like the superior articular processes of the lumbar vertebrae. In front of each articular process is an intervertebral notch. The inferior extremity of the bone presents a small oval surface which articulates with the coccyx; and on each side a notch, which, with a corresponding notch in the upper border of the coccyx, forms the foramen for the transmission of the fifth sacral nei ve. The sacrum presents some variety in respect of curvature, and of the number of pieces which enter into its structure. The curve is often very slight, and is situated only near the lower part of the bone; while in other subjects it is considerable, and occurs at the middle of the sacrum. The sexual differences in the sacrum relate to its greater breadth, and the greater angle which it forms with the rest of the vertebral column in the female, rather than to any pecu- liarity in shape. It is sometimes composed of six pieces, more rarely of four, and, occasionally, the first and second pieces remain perma- nently separate. Development.—By twenty-one points of ossification; five for each of the first three pieces, viz. one for the body, one for each lateral portion, and one for each lamina; and three for each of the last two, namely, one for the body and one for each lateral portion. In the progress of growth, and after puberty, fourteen epiphysal centres are added, namely, two for the surfaces of each body, one for each auri- cular surface, and one for the thin edge of each lateral border. Ossification begins in the bodies of the sacral pieces somewhat later than in those of the true vertebrae; the first three appearing during the eighth and ninth week, and the last two at about the middle of intra-uterine existence. Ossification of the lamellae takes place dur- ing the interval between the sixth and ninth month. The epiphyses for the upper and under surface of the bodies are developed during the interval between the fifteenth and eighteenth year; and for the auricular and marginal piece, after twenty. The two lower verte- bral pieces, although the last to appear, are the first to be com- pleted (between the fourth' and fifth year), and to unite by their iDodies. The union of the bodies takes place from below upwards, and finishes, between the twenty-fifth and the thirtieth year, with the first two pieces. Articulation.—-With/owr bones; the last lumbar vertebra, ossa innominata, and coccyx. Attachment of Muscles.—To seve^i pairs; in front the pyriformis.21 COCCYX. on the side the coccygeus, and behind the gluteus maximus, latis- simus dorsi, longissimus dorsi, sacro-lumbalis, and multifidns spin^. Fiff. 12. The Coccyx {kokkv^, cnckoo, from resembling a cuckoo's beak) is composed of four small pieces, which form the caudal termination of the vertebral column. The superior piece is broad, and expands laterally into two transverse processes; it is sur- mounted by an oval articular surface and two cornua, the former to articu- late with the apex of the sacrum, the latter with the sacral cornua. The lateral wings sometimes become con- nected with the sacrum, and convert the notches for the iifth pair of sacral nerves into foramina. The remaining three pieces diminish in size from above downwards. Development.—By/o-wr centres, one for each piece. Ossification com- mences in the first piece soon after birth; in the second, between five and ten years; in the third, between ten and fifteen; and in the fourth, between fifteen and twenty. The pieces unite at an earlier period than the bodies of the sacrum, the first two pieces first, then the third and fourth, and lastly the second and third. Between forty and sixty years, the coccyx becomes consolidated with the sacrum; this event taking place later in the female than in the male. Articulations.—With the sacrum.

The skull, or superior expansion of the vertebral column, is divisible into two parts, the cranium and the face; the former being adapted, by its form, structure, and strength, to contain and protect the brain, and the latter the chief organs of sense. The Cranium is composed of eight separate bones; viz. the Occipital Bone.—This bone is situated at the posterior part and base of the cranium. It is trapezoid in figure, and divisible into two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. External Surface.—Crossing the middle of the bone transversely, from one lateral angle to the other, is a prominent ridge, the superior * The external surface of the occipital bone. 1.

Above and below the superior curved line the surface is rough, for the attachment of muscles. About three- quarters of an inch below this line is another transverse ridge, the inferior curved line, and beneath the latter the foramen rfiagnwm. On each side of the foramen magnum, nearer its anterior than its posterior segment, and encroaching somewhat upon the opening, is an oblong articular surface, the condyle, for articulation with the atlas. The condyles approach towards each other anteriorly, and their articular surfaces look downwards and outwards. Directly behind each condyle is an irregular fossa, and a small opening, the posterior condyloid foramen, for the transmission of a vein to the lateral sinus. In front of the condyle is the anterior condyloid fora- men, fj^r the hypoglossal nerve; on the outer side of each condyle a projectmg ridge, the transverse process, excavated in front by a notch which forms part of the jugular foramen; and directly behind the ridge, and forming its posterior boundary, a prominent process, the jugular tubercle. * In front of the foramen magnum is a thick square mass, the basilar process, and in the centre of the basilar process a small tubercle for the attachment of the superior and middle con- strictor muscles of the pharynx. Internal Surface.—Upon the internal surface is a crucial ridge, which divides the bone into four fossae; the two superior or cerebral fossae lodging the posterior lobes of the cerebrum; and the two in- ferior or cerebellar, the lateral lobes of the cerebellum. The supe- rior arm of the crucial ridge is grooved for the superior longitudinal sinus, and gives attachment to the falx cerebri; the inferior arm is sharp and prominent for the attachment of the falx cerebelli, and slightly grooved for the two occipital sinuses. The transverse ridge gives attachment to the tentorium cerebelli, and is deeply grooved for the lateral sinuses. At the point of meeting of the four arms is a projection, the internal occipital protuberance, which corresponds with the similar process situated upon the external surface of the bone. The convergence of the four grooves forms a slightly depressed fossa, upon which rests the torcular Herophili. In the centre of the basilar portion of the bone is the foramen magnum, oblong in form, and larger behind than before, transmitting the spinal cord, spinal accessory nerves, and vertebral arteriea. Upon the lateral margins of the foramen magnum are two rough eminences, which give attach- ment to the odontoid ligaments, and immediately above these, the openings of the anterior condyloid foramina. In front of the foramen magnum is the basilar process, grooved on its surface for supporting the medulla oblongata, and along each lateral border for the inferior petrosal sinus. On each side of the foramen magnum is a groove, for the termination of the lateral sinus; a smooth surface, which forms part of the jugular fossa; and a projecting process, which divides the * Ketzius remarks that the jugular tubercle is very long in certain mammalia.24 OCCIPITAL BONE. two, and is called the jugular eminence. Into tlie jugular fossa will be seen opening the posterior condyloid foramen. The superior borders are very much serrated, and assist in forming the lamhdoidal suture; the inferior are rough, hut not serrated, and articulate with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone by means of the additamentum suturse lambdoidalis. The jugular eminence and side of the basilar process articulate with the petrous portion of the Fig. 14.* temporal bone, and the intermediate space, which is irregularly notched, forms the posterior boundary of the jugular foramen, or foramen lacerum posterius. The angles of the occipital bone are the superior, inferior, and two lateral. The superior angle is received into the interval formed by the union of the posterior and superior angles of the parietal bones, and corresponds with that portion of the foetal head which is called * The internal surface of the occipital bone. 1.

The lateral angles at each side project into the interval formed by the articulation of the posterior and in- ferior angle of the parietal with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Development.—By seven centres; four for the four parts of the ex- panded portion divided by the crucial ridge, one for each condyle, and one for the basilar process. Ossification commences in the expanded portion of the bone at a period anterior to the vertebrae ; at birth the bone consists of four distinct pieces; they are united at about the fifth or sixth year. After twenty the basilar process unites with the body of the sphenoid. Articulations.—With six bones; two parietal, two temporal, sphe- noid, and atlas. Attachment of Muscles.—To thirteen pairs : to the rough surface above the superior curved line, the occipito-frontalis; to the superior curved lime, the trapezius and sterno-mastoid; to the rough space between the curved lines, complexus, and splenius capitis; to the space between the inferior curved line and the foramen magnum, the rectus posticus major and minor, and obliquus superior; to the trans- verse process, the rectus lateralis; and to the basilar process, the reqtus anticus major and minor, and superior and middle constrictor muscles.

The superior border is straight, to articulate vdth. its fellow of the opposite side. The inferior border is arched and thin, to articulate with the temporal bone. The anterior border is concave, and the posterior somewhat convex. External Surface.—Crossing the bone in a longitudinal direction from the anterior to the posterior border, is an arched line, the tem- poral ridge, to which the temporal fascia is attached. In the middle of this line, and nearly in the centre of the bone, is the projection called the parietal eminence, which marks the centre of ossification. Above the temporal ridge the surface is rough, and covered by the aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis; below the ridge the bone is smooth {planum semicirculare), for the attachment of the fleshy fibres of the temporal muscle. Near the superior border of the bone, and at about one-third from its posterior extremity, is the parietal fora- men, which transmits a vein to the superior longitudinal sinus. This foramen is often absent.

Along the upper border is part of a shallow groove, completed by the opposite parietal bone, which serves to con- tain the superior longitudinal sinus. Some slight pits are also observ- able near this groove, which lodge the glandulge Pacchioni. The anterior inferior angle is thin and lengthened, and articulates with the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. Upon its inner surface it is deeply channelled by a groove for the trunk of the arteria menin- gea media. This groove is frequently converted into a canal. The posterior inferior angle is thick, and presents a broad and shallow groove for the lateral sinus. Development.—By a single centre. Ossification commences at the parietal eminence at the same time with the bodies of the vertebrse. Articulations.—Withj^i;e bones; with the opposite parietal bone, the occipital, frontal, temporal, and sphenoid. Attachment of Muscles.—To one only, the temporal. The apo- neurosis of the occipito-frontalis glides over its upper surface. Frontal Bone.—The frontal bone bears some resemblance in form to the under valve of a scallop-shell. It is situated at the anterior part of the cranium, forming the forehead, and assists in the construc- tion of the roof of the orbits and nose. Hence it is divisible into a superior or frontal portion, and an inferior or orbito-nasal portion. Each of these portions presents for examination an external and in- ternal surface, borders, and processes. Exf,ernal Surface.—At about the middle of each lateral half of the frontal portion is a projection, the frontal eminence. Below these points are the superciliary ridges, large towards their inner termina- tion, and becoming gradually smaller as they arch outwards : they support the eyebrows. Beneath the superciliary ridges are the sharp and prominent arches which form the upper margin of the orbits, the supra-orbital ridges. Externally the supra-orbital ridge terminates in the external angular process, and internally in the internal angular process; at the inner third of this ridge is a notch, sometimes con- verted into a foramen, the supra-orbital notch, which gives passage to the supra-orbital artery, veins, and nerve. Between the two superciliary ridges is a rough projection, the nasal tuberosity; this portion of the bone denotes by its prominence the situation of the frontal sinuses. Extending upwards and backwards from the ex- ternal angular process is a sharp ridge, the commencement of the temporal ridge, and beneath this a depressed surface that forms part of the temporal fossa. The orbito-nasal portion of the bone consists of two thin processes, the orbital plates, which form the roof of the orbits, and an inter- vening notch which lodges the ethmoid bone, and is called the ethmoidal fissure. The edges of the ethmoidal fissure are hollowed into cavities, which, by their union with the ethmoid bone, complete the ethmoidal cells; and, crossing these edges transversely, are two28 FRONTAL BONE. small grooves, sometimes canals, which open into the orbit by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina. At the anterior termina- tion of these edges are the irregular openings which lead into the frontal sinuses; and between the two internal angular processes, is a rough excavation which receives the nasal bones, and a projecting pro- cess, the nasal spine. Upon each orbital plate, immediately beneath the external angular process, is a shallow depression which lodges the Fig. 17.* lachrymal gland; and beneath the internal angular process a small pit, sometimes a tubercle, to which the cartilaginous pulley of the superior oblique muscle is attached. Internal Surface.—Along the middle line of this surface is a grooved ridge, the edges of the ridge giving attachment to the falx cerebri and the groove lodging the superior longitudinal sinus. At the commencement of the ridge is an opening, sometimes completed by the ethmoid bone, the foramen ccecum.

Ossi- fication begins in the orbital arches, somewhat before the vertebrae. The two pieces are separate at birth, and unite by suture during the first year, the suture sometimes remaining permanent through life. The frontal sinuses make their appearance during the first year, and increase in size until old age. Articulations.—With tioelve hone^ : two parietal, sphenoid, eth- moid, two nasal, two superior maxillary, two lachrymal, and two malar. Attachment of Muscles.—To two pairs: corrugator supercilii, and temporal. Temporal Bone.—The temporal bone is situated at the side and base of the skull, and is divisible into a squamous, mastoid, and petrous portion.

Near the commencement of the zygoma, upon its lower border, is a projection called the tubercle, to which is attached the external lateral ligament of the lower jaw, and continued horizontally inwards from the tubercle, a rounded eminence, the eminentia arti- cularis. The process of bone which is continued from the tubercle of the zygoma into the eminentia articularis is the inferior root of the zygoma. The superior root is continued upwards from the upper border of the zygoma, and forms the posterior part of the temporal ridge, serving by its projection to mark the division of the squamous from the mastoid portion of the bone; and the middle root is conti- nued directly backwards, and terminates abruptly at a narrow fissure, the fissura Glaseri. The internal surface of the squamous portion is marked by several shallow fossce, which correspond with the convolu- tions of the cerebrum, and by a furrow for the posterior branch of the arteria meningea media. The superior, or squamous border, is very thin, and bevelled at the expense of the inner surface, so as to overlap the lower and arched border of the parietal bone. The iiife- nor border is thick, and dentated to articulate with the spinous process of the sphenoid bone. The Mastoid portion forms the posterior part of the bone; it is thick, and hollowed between its tables into a loose and cellular diploe. Upon its external surface it is rough for the attachment of muscles, and contrasts strongly with the smooth and polished-like surface of the squamous portion: every part of this surface is pierced by small foramiha, which give passage to minute arteries and veins; one of these openings, oblique in its direction, of large size, and situated near the posterior border of the bone, the mastoid foramen, trans- mits a- vein to the lateral sinus. This foramen is not unfrequently situated in the occipital bone. The inferior part of this portion is round and expanded, the mastoid process, and excavated in its inte- rior into numerous cells, which form a part of the organ of hearing. In front of the mastoid process, and between the superior and middle roots of the zygoma, is the large oval opening of the meatus audito- rius externus, surrounded by a rough lip, the processus auditorius. Directly to the inner side of, and partly concealed by, the mastoid process, is a deep groove, the digastric fossa; and a little more in- ternally the occipital groove, which lodges the occipital artery. Upon its internal surface the mastoid portion presents a broad and shallow groove {fossa sigmoidea) for the lateral sinus, and terminat- ing in this groove the internal opening of the mastoid foramen. The superior border of the mastoid portion is dentated; and its posterior border, thick and less serrated, articulates with the inferior border of the occipital bone. The meatus auditoriits externus is a slightly curved canal, some- what more than half an inch in length, longer along its lower32 TEMPORAL BONE. than its upper wall, and directed obliquely inwards and forwards. The Petrous portion of the temporal hone is named from its ex- treme hardness and density. It is a three-sided pyramid, projecting horizontally forwards into the base of the skull, the base being applied against the internal surface of the squamous and mastoid portions, and the apex being received into the triangular interval between the spinous process of the sphenoid and the basilar process of the occi- pital bone. For convenience of description it is divisible into three surfaces—anterior, posterior, and basilar; and three borders—supe- rior, anterior, and posterior.

The posterior surface forms the front boundary of the posterior fossa of the base of the sknll; near its middle is the oblique entrance of the meatus auditorius internus. Above the meatus auditorius intemus is a small oblique fissure, and a minute foramen; the former lodges a process of the dura mater, and the foramen gives passage to a small vein. Further outwards, towards the mastoid portion of the bone, is a small slit, almost hidden by a thin plate of bone; this is the aquceductus vestihidi, and transmits a small artery and vein of the vestibule and a process of dura mater. Below the meatus, and partly concealed by the margin of the posterior border of the bone, is the aqua^ductus cochlecBy through which passes a vein from the cochlea to the internal jugular vein, and a process of dura mater. The meatus auditorius internus is about one-third of an inch in depth, and pursues a slightly oblique course in relation to the petrous portion of the temporal bone, but a course directly outwards in relation to the cranium. At the bottom of the meatus, and upon its anterior aspect, is a reniform fossa, the con- cave border of which is directed towards the ^^9- 22.* entrance of the meatus. The reniform fossa is divided into an upper and lower compartment by ^sg^ a sharp ridge, which is prolonged for some dis- j f^A^ tance u|pon the anterior wall of the meatus, and ^^^Pl-. sometimes as far as its aperture; this ridge J^^^y ' marks the situation of the two nerves of the ~ tion. 2.

Along the convexity of the reniform fossa, and arranged in a curved line from above downwards, are four or five openings, the two upper ones being the largest, and occupying the superior compart- ment of the fossa, the two or three inferior ones, smaller than the upper, the inferior compartment. Behind the latter, at the dis- tance of a line and a half, and on the posterior wall of the meatus, is a cluster of three or four oblique openings, two of which are minute. The inferior and larger compartment of the reniform fossa presents a well-marked spiral groove, which commences on the convex border of the fossa, immediately below the line of openings above described, and, sweeping round the convexity of the inferior com- partment, and becoming deeper as it proceeds, terminates by a small round aperture in the centre of the spire. The uppermost of the openings of the reniform fossa is the aperture of the aquseductus Fallopii, and gives passage to the facial nerve. The rest are cul de sacs, pierced at the bottom by numerous minute foramina for the passage of filaments of the vestibular nerve, while the cluster of three openings on the posterior wall of the meatus is intended for single filaments of the same nerve. The spiral groove corresponds with the base of the cochlea, and being pierced by a number of minute foramina for filaments of the cochlear nerve, is named tractus spiralis foraminulentus. The opening in the centre of the spiral impression leads into a canal which occupies the central axis of the modiolus, and is thence called tubulus centralis modioli. The basilar surface of the petrous portion is rough and irregular, and enters into the formation of the under surface of the base of the skull. Projecting downwards, near its middle, is a long sharp spine, the styloid process, occasionally connected with the bone only by cartilage, and lost during maceration, particularly in the young subject. At the base of this process is a rough sheath-like ridge, into which the styloid process appears implanted, the vaginal pro- cess (tympanic lamina*). In front of the vaginal process is a broad triangular depression, the glenoid fossa, bounded in front by the eminentia articularis, behind by the vaginal process, and externally by the rough lip of the processus auditorius. This fossa is divided transversely by the glenoid fissure (fissura Glaseri), which lodges the extremity of the processus gracilis of the malleus, and transmits the laxator tympani muscle, chorda tympani nerve, and anterior tympanic artery. The surface of the fossa in front of the fissure is smooth, to articulate with the condyle of the lower jaw; and that behind the fissure rough, for the reception of a part of the parotid gland. At the extremity of the inner angle of the glenoid fossa is the foramen of the Eustachian tube; and separated from it by a thin, lamella of bone, called processus cochleariformis, is a small canal for the transmission of the tensor tympani muscle. * Eetzius remarks that the tympanic lamina is a distinct bone in many vertebrata.35 TEMPOKAL BONE. Directly behind, and at the root of the styloid process, is the stylo-mastoid foramen, the opening of exit of the facial nerve, and of entrance of the stylo-mastoid artery. Nearer the apex of the bone is a large oval opening, the carotid foramen, the commencement of the carotid canal, which lodges the internal carotid artery and carotid plexus. And between the stylo-mastoid and carotid fora- men, in the posterior border, is an irregular excavation forming part of the jugular fossa for the commencement of the internal jugular vein. The share of the jugular fossa formed by the petrous portion of the temporal bone is very different in different bones; but in all, the fossa presents a vertical ridge on its inner side, which cuts off a small portion from the rest. The upper part of this ridge forms a spinous projection, the jugidar process, the groove to the inner side of the ridge lodges the eighth pair of nerves, and the lower part of the ridge is the septum of division between the jugular fossa and carotid foramen. Upon this portion of the ridge near the posterior margin of the carotid foramen is a small opening leading into a canal, which transmits the tympanic branch (Jacobson's nerve) of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Between the jugular fossa and stylo-mastoid foramen is another small opening leading into the canal for the passage of the auricular branch of the pneumogastric nerve. The superior border of the petrous portion is sharp, and gives attachment to the tentorium cerebelli. It is grooved for the supe- rior petrosal sinus, and near its extremity is marked by a smooth notch jupon which reclines the fifth nerve. The anterior border is grooved for the Eustachian tube, and forms the posterior boundary of the foramen lacerum basis cranii ; by its sharp extremity it gives attachment to the tensor tympani and levator palati muscle. The posterior border is grooved for the inferior petrosal sinus, and exca- vated for the jugular fossa ; it forms the anterior boundary of the foramen lacerum posterius. Development.—By five centres : one for the squamous portion, one for the mastoid process, one for the petrous portion, one for the auditory process, which in the foetus is a mere bony ring, in- complete superiorly, and serving for the attach- ment of the membrana tympani, annulus mem- Fig. 23.* brance tympani; and one for the styloid process. Ossification occurs in these pieces in the following order : in the squamous portion immediately after the vertebrae, then in the petrous, tympanic, mastoid, and styloid. The tympanic ring is united by its extremities to the squamous portion during the last month of intra-uterine life ; the squamous, petrous, and mastoid portions are consolidated during the first year; and the styloid some years after birth. It not unfrequently * The annulus membranee tympani or tympanic bone of the foetal skull, right side.

The subsequent changes in the bone are the increase of size of the glenoid fossa, the growth of the meatus auditorius externus, the levelling of the surfaces of the petrous portion, and the development of mastoid cells. Traces of the union of the petrous with the squamous portion of the bone are usually perceptible in the adult. Articulations.—With five bones : occipital, parietal, sphenoid, inferior maxillary, and malar. Attachment of Muscles.—To fourteen: by the squamous portion, to the temporal; by the zygoma, to the masseter ; by the mastoid portion, to the occipito-frontalis, splenius capitis, sterno-mastoid, trachelo-mastoid, digastricus and retrahens aurem ; by the styloid process, to the stylo-pharyngeus, stylo-hyoideus, stylo-glossus, and two ligaments, the stylo-hyoid and stylo-maxillary ; and by the petrous portion, to the levator palati, tensor tympani, and stapedius. Sphenoid Bone,—The sphenoid ((t^^v, a wedge) is an irregular bone situated at the base of the skull, wedged between the other bones of the cranium, and entering into the formation both of the cranium and face. It bears some resemblance, in form, to a bat with its wings extended, and is divisible into body, wings, and processes. The body forms the central mass of the bone, from which the wings and processes are projected. From the upper and anterior part of the body extend on each side two small triangular plates, the lesser wings ; from either side and expanding laterally are the greater wings ; proceeding backwards from the base of the greater wings, the spinous processes, and downwards, the pterygoid pro- cesses. The body presents for examination a superior or cerebral surface, an antero-inferior surface, and a posterior surface. Superior surface.—At the anterior extremity of this surface is a small projecting plate, the ethmoidal spine, and spreading out on either side the lesser wings. Behind the ethmoidal spine in the middle line is a rounded elevation, the olivary process, which sup- ports the commissure of the optic nerves; and on either side of the posterior margin of this process a tubercle, the middle clinoid process. Passing outwards and forwards from the olivary process, are the ojMic foramina, wliich transmit the optic nerves and ophthalmic arteries. Behind the optic foramina are two sharp tubercles, the anterior clinoid processes, which are the inner termi- nations of the lesser wings. Beneath these processes, on the sides of the olivary process, are two depressions* for the last turn of the internal carotid arteries. Behind the olivary process is the sella turcica (ephippium), the deep fossa which lodges the pituitary gland * These depressions are occasionally, as in a skull before me, converted into foramina by the extension of a short bony pillar from the middle to the an- terior clinoid process.SPHENOID BONE. 37 and circular sinus ; behind and somewhat overhanging the sella turcica, is a broad rough plate (dorsum ephippii) bounded at each angle by a tubercle, the posterior clinoid processes; and behind this plate an inclined surface (cliras Blumenbachii), which is con- tinuous with the basilar process of the occipital bone. On either side of the sella turcica is a broad groove {carotid) which lodges the internal carotid artery, cavernous sinus, and orbital nerves. Immediately external to this groove, at the junction of the greater wings with the body, are four foramina : the first is a broad interval, the sphenoidal fissure, which separates the greater and lesser wings, and transmits the third, fourth, the three branches of the ophthalmic division of the fifth and sixth nerves, and the ophthalmic vein. Behind and beneath this fissure is the foramen rotiindum for the superior maxillary nerve ; and still farther back, in the base of the spinous process, the foramen ovale for the in- * The superior or cerebral surface of the sphenoid bone. 1.

Behind the foramen ovale, near the apex of the spinous process, is the foramen spinosum for the arteria mer ningea media. Upon the antero-inferior surface of the sphenoid is a long flat- tened spine or crest, the superior part of which, crista sjihenoidalis, articulates with the central lamella of the ethmoid, while the Fig. 25* inferior part, longer and sharper, the rostrum sphenoidale, _ is in- tended to be inserted iato the sheath formed by the upper border of the vomer. On either side of the crista sphenoidalis is an irregular opening leading into the sphenoidal cells. The sphenoidal cells, which are absent in the young subject, are divided by a median septum which is continuous with the crista, and are partially closed by two thin plates of bone (frequently broken away), the sphenoidal spongy hones. On each side of the sphenoidal cells are the outlets of the optic foramina, sphenoidal fissures, and foramina rotunda, the lesser and greater wings ; and, below, the pterygoid processes. Upon the under surface of the body are two thin plates of bone {"processus vaginales) proceeding from the base of the pterygoid process at each side, and intended for articulation with the borders of the vomer. On each of these plates, close to the root of the pterygoid process, is a groove (sometimes a complete canal) converted into a canal by the palate bone, the pterygo-palatine canal for the * The antero-inferior view of the sphenoid bone. 1.

The posterior surface is flat and rough, and articulates with the basilar process of the occipital bone. In the adult this union is usually completed by bone ; from which circumstance the sphenoid, in conjunction with the occipital, is described by Soemmering and Meckel as a single bone, under the name of spheno-occipital. The posterior surface is continuous on each side with the spinous process, and at the angle of union is the termination of the Vidian canal. The lesser wings (processes of Ingrassias) are thin and triangular, the base being attached to the upper and anterior part of the body of ihe sphenoid, and the apex, prolonged outwards, and terminating in an acute point. The anterior border is irregularly serrated, the posterior being free and rounded, and received into the fissure of Sylvius of the cerebrum. The inner extremity of this border is the anterior clinoid process, which is supported by a short pillar of bone, giving attachment to a part of the common tendon of the muscles of the orbit. The lesser wing forms the posterior part of the roof of the orbit, and its base is traversed by the optic foramen. The greater wings present three surfaces ; a superior or cerebral, which forms part of the middle fossa of the base of the skull ; an anterior surface, which assists in forming the outer wall of the orbit ; and an external surface, divided into two parts by the pterygoid ridge. The superior part of the external surface enters into tijie formation of the temporal fossa, and the inferior portion forms "part of the zygomatic fossa. The pterygoid ridge, dividing the two, gives attachment to the upper origin of the pterygoideus externus muscle. The spinous processes project backwards at each side from the base of the greater wings of the sphenoid, and are received into the angular intervals between the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bones. Piercing the base of each process is a large oval opening, the foramen ovale; nearer its apex a smaller opening, the foramen spinosum; and extending downwards from the apex, a short spine, which gives attachment to the internal lateral liga- ment of the lower jaw and to the laxator tympani muscle. The external border of the spinous process is rough, to articulate with the lower border of the squamous portion of the temporal bone; the internal border forms the anterior boundary of the foramen lacerum basis cranii, and is somewhat grooved for the reception of the Eustachian tube. The pterygoid processes descend perpendicularly from the base of the greater wings, and form in the articulated skull the lateral boundary of the posterior nares. Each process consists of an ex- ternal and internal plate, and an anterior surface. The external plate is broad and thin, giving attachment, by its external surface, to the external pterygoid muscle, and by its internal surface to the40 ETHMOID BONE. internal pterygoid. TMs plate is sometimes pierced by a foramen, wMciL is not unfreqnently formed by a process of communication passing between it and tlie spinous process. The internal pterygoid plate is long and narrow, and terminated at its extremity by a curved hook, the hamular process, around which plays the tendon of the tensor palati muscle. At the base of the internal pterygoid plate is a small oblong depression, the scaphoid fossa, from which arises the circumflexus or tensor palati muscle. The interval be- tween the two pterygoid plates is the pterygoid fossa; and the two plates are separated inferiorly by an angular notch {palatine), which receives the tuberosity, or pterygoid process, of the palate bone. The anterior surface of the pterygoid process is broad near its base, and supports Meckel's ganglion. The base of the process is pierced by the Vidian canal. Developinent.—By twelve centres ; four for the body, viz., two for its anterior (spheno-orbital), and two for its posterior part (spheno-temporal); four for the four wings ; two for the internal pterygoid plates, and two for the sphenoidal spongy bones. Ossifi- cation commences in the various pieces of the sphenoid in the following order :—greater alse, at about the same time with the other bones of the cranium ; lesser alae and posterior body, at the end of the second month ; anterior body at the end of the third ; internal pterygoid plate and spongy bones, between the period of birth and the second year. Osseous union occurs first between the centres for the posterior body, and at about the same time between each centre of the anterior body and its corresponding (lesser) ala; the third union takes place between the internal pterygoid plate and the greater ala ; the fourth between ther two centres of the anterior body, and at the same time between the anterior and posterior body. This is the state of union at birth, the bone con- sisting of five centres, one being the body and lesser alse ; one, on each side, the great ala and internal pterygoid plate ; and the re- maining two the sphenoidal spongy bones. The greater alee unite with the body during the first year; the spongy bones after puberty; and the body of the sphenoid with the basilar process of the occi- pital bone between eighteen and twenty-five. Articulations.—^With tivelve bones : that is, with all the bones of the head, and five of the face, viz. two malar, two palate, and vomer. Attachment of Muscles.—To twelve pairs : temporal, external pterygoid, iaternal pterygoid, superior constrictor, tensor palati, laxator tympani, levator palpebrae, obliquus superior, superior rectus, internal rectus, inferior rectus, and external rectus. Ethmoid Bone.—The ethmoid {ri9ixbg, a sieve) is a square- shaped cellular bone, situated between the two orbits, at the root of the nose, and perforated upon its upper surface by a number of small openings, from which peculiarity it has received its name. It consists of a perpendicular lamella and two lateral masses.41 ETHMOID BONE. The perpendicular lamella is a thin central plate, which articu- lates with the vomer and cartilage of the septum, and assists in forming the septum of the nose. It is surmounted superiorly by a thick and strong process, the crista galli, which projects into the cavity of the skull, and gives attachment to the falx cerebri. From the base of the anterior border of this process there project forward two small plates, alar processes, which are received into corre- sponding depressions in the frontal bone, and often complete pos- teriorly the foramen csecum. On each side of the crista galli, upon the upper surface of the bone, is a thin and grooved plate perforated by a number of small openings, the cribriform lamella, which sup- ports the bulb of the olfactory nerve, and gives passage to its fila- ments, and to the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. In the middle of the groove of this lamella the foramiua pierce the bone com- pletely, but at either side they are the apertures of canals, which run for some distance in the substance of the central lamella, inner wall of the lateral mass, and spongy bones. The opening for the nasal nerve is a narrow slit in the ante- rior part of the cribriform lamella, close to the cristi galli. The cribri- form lamella serves to connect the lateral masses with the perpen- dicular 'plate. The lateral masses (labyrinthi) are divisible into an internal and external surface, and four borders, superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior. The internal surface is rough, slightly convex, and forms the external boundary of the upper part of the nasal fossae. Towards the posterior border of this surface is a narrow horizontal fissure, the superior meatus of the nose, the upper margin of which is thin, and somewhat curled inwards ; hence it is named the su/perior turbinated bone (concha superior). Below the meatus is the convex surface of another thin plate, which is curled outwards, and forms * The ethmoid bone seen from above and behind. 1. The central lamella. 2, 2.

The external surface is quadrilateral and smooth ; hence it is named os planum, and, from its thinness, lamina papyracea; it enters into the formation of the inner wall of the orbit. The superior border is irregular and cellular, the cells being completed by the edges of the ethmoidal fissure of the frontal bone. This border is crossed by two grooves, sometimes complete canals, opening into the orbit by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal fora- mina. The inferior border is formed internally by the lower border of the middle turbinated bone, and externally by a concave irre- gular fossa, the upper boundary of the middle meatus. The anterior border presents a number of incomplete cells, which are closed by the superior maxillary and lachrymal bone ; the posterior border is irregularly cellular, to articulate ydth. the sphenoid and palate bone. The lateral masses are composed of cells, which are divided by a thin partition into anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells. The an- terior, the most numerous, communicate with the frontal sinuses, and open by means of an irregular and incomplete tubular canal, the infundibulum, into the middle meatus. The posterior cells, fewer in number, open into the superior meatus. Development.—By three centres : one for each lateral mass, and one for the perpendicular lamella. Ossification commences in the lateral masses at about the beginning of the fifth month, appearing first in the os planum, and then in the spongy bones. During the latter half of the first year after birth, the central lamella and lamina cribrosa begin to ossify, and are united to the lateral masses by the beginning of the second year. The cells of the ethmoid are developed in the course of the fourth and fifth year. Articidations.—With thirteen bones : two of the cranium, frontal and sphenoid ; the rest of the face, viz. nasal, superior maxillary, lachrymal, palate, inferior turbinated, and vomer. No muscles are attached to this bone. BONES OP THE PACE. The face is composed of fourteen bones ; viz. Two nasal. Two palate, Two superior maxillary. Two inferior turbinated, Two lachrymal, Vomer, Two malar. Inferior maxillary. Nasal Bones.—The nasal are two small quadrangular bones, forming by their union the bridge and base of the nose. Upon the upper surface they are convex, and pierced by a foramen for a small artery ; on ^the under surface they are somewhat concave, and marked by a groove, which lodges the nasal branch of the ophthalmic43 SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONES. nerve. The superior border is narrow and thick, the inferior broad, thin, and irre- gular. Development.—By a single centre for each bone, the first ossific deposition mak- ing its appearance at the same time as in the vertebrae. Articulations.—With four bones : fron- tal, ethmoid, nasal, and superior maxil- lary. Attachment of Muscles. — It has in relation with it the pyramidalis nasi and compressor nasi ; but neither is inserted into it. Superior Maxillary Bones.—The superior maxillary are the largest bones of the face, with the exception of the lower jaw ; they form, by their union, the whole of the upper jaw, and assist in the construction of the nose, orbit, cheek, and palate. Each bone is divisible into a body and four processes. The hody is triangular in form, and hollowed in its interior into a large cavity, the antrum maxillare (antrum of Highmore). It presents for examination four sur- Fig. 28.t faces, external or facial, internal or nasal, posterior or zygomatic, and superior or orbital. The external, ov facial surf ace, forms the anterior part of the bone ; it is irregularly concave, and presents a deep depression towards its centre, the canine fossa, which gives attachment to two muscles, the compressor nasi and levator anguli oris. Imme- diately above this fossa is the infraorbital foramen, the termi- natioD of the infraorbital canal, transmitting the superior maxil- lary nerve and infraorbital artery; and above the infraorbital foramen is the lower margin of the orbit, * The nasal bone of the left side; its external or convex surface. 1.

Towards the middle line of the face this surface is bounded "by the concave border of the opening of the nose, the border is pro- jected forwards at its inferior termination into a sharp process, form- ing, vdth a similar process of the opposite bone, the nasal spine. Beneath the nasal spine, and above the two superior in- cisor teeth, is a slight de- pression, the incisive, or myrtiform fossa, which gives origin to the depressor la- bii superioris alseque nasi muscle. The myrtiform fossa is divided from the canine fossa by a perpendicular ridge, corresponding with the direction of the root of the canine tooth. The in- ferior boundary of the facial surface is the alveolar pro- cess which contains the teeth of the upper jaw ; and the facial is separated from the zygomatic surface by a strong projecting eminence, the ma- lar process. The internal, or nasal sur- face, presents a large irregu- lar opening, leading into the antrum maxillare ; this opening is nearly closed in the articulated skull by the ethmoid, palate, lachrymal, and inferior turbinated bone. The cavity of the antrum is some- what triangular, corresponding in shape Avith the form of the body of the boiie. Upon its inner wall are numerous grooves, lodging orbital foramen. 6.

In front of the opening of the antrum is the strong ascending plate of the nasal process, marked inferiorly by a rough horizontal ridge (crista turbinalis inferior), which gives attachment to the inferior turbinated bone. The concave depression immediately above this ridge corresponds with the middle meatus of the nose, and that below the ridge with the inferior meatus. Be- tween the nasal process and the opening of the antrum, is a deep vertical groove (sulcus lachrymalis), which is converted into a canal by the lachrymal and inferior turbinated bone, and constitutes the nasal duct. The superior border of the nasal surface is irregu- larly cellular, and articulates with the lachrymal and ethmoid bone; the posterior border is rough, and articulates with the palate bone; the anterior border is sharp, and forms the free margin of the open- ing of the nose; and from the inferior border projects inwards a strong horizontal plate, the palate process. The posterior surface may be called zygomatic, from forming part of the zygomatic fossa : it is bounded externally by the malar pro- cess, and internally by a rough and rounded border, the tuberosity, which is pierced by a number of small foramina (foramina alveolaria posteriora), giving passage to the posterior dental nerves and branches of the superior dental artery. The lower part of this tuberosity presents a rough oval surface, to articulate with the palate b(^ne, and immediately above and to the inner side of this articular surface a smooth groove, which forms part of the posterior palatine canal. The superior border is smooth and rounded, form- ing the lower boundary of the spheno-maxillary fissure, and marked by a notch, the commencement of the infraorbital canal. The inferior boundary is the alveolar process, containing the last two molar teeth. The orbital surface is triangular and thin, and constitutes the floor of the orbit. It is bounded internally by an irregular edge, which articulates with the palate, ethmoid, and lachrymal bone ; posteriorly, by the smooth border which enters into the formation of the spheno-maxillary fissure ; and, anteriorly, by a convex margin, partly smooth and partly rough, the smooth portion forming part of the lower border of the orbit, and the rough articulating with the malar bone. The middle of this surface is channelled by a deep groove and canal, the infraorbital, which terminates at the infra- orbital foramen ; and near the root of the nasal process is a slight depression, marking the origin of the inferior oblique muscle of the eyeball. The four processes of the superior maxillary bone are the nasal, malar, alveolar, and palate. The nasal 2^'>'ocess ascends by the side of the nose, to which it forms the lateral boundary, and articulates with the frontal and nasal bone. By its external surface it gives attachment to the levator labii superioris al8eq^e nasi, and to the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle. Its internal swrface contributes to form the inner wall of the nares,46 SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONES. and is marked transversely by a horizontal ridge (crista turbinalis superior), whicb divides it into two portions, one above the ridge irregular and uneven, for giving attachment to and completing the cells of the lateral mass of the ethmoid ; the other below, smooth and concave, corresponding Y^ith the middle meatus. The posterior border is thick and hollowed into a groove for the nasal duct; while the prominent margin in front of this groove is continuous with the lower border of the orbit; this margin is marked by a small tubercle, which serves as a guide to the introduction of the knife in the ope- ration for fistula lachrymalis. The malar process, large and irregular, is situated at the angle of separation between the facial and zygomatic surfaces, and presents a triangular surface for articulation with the malar bone. The alveolar process forms the lower margin of the bone ; it is spongy and cellular in texture, and excavated into deep holes for the reception of eight teeth. The palate process is thick and strong, and projects horizontally inwards from the inner surface of the body of the bone. Superiorly, it is concave and smooth, and forms the floor of the nares ; in- feriorly, it is also concave but uneven, and assists in the formation of the roof of the palate. This surface is marked by a deep groove, which lodges the anterior palatine nerve and superior palatine artery. Its internal edge is raised into a ridge (crista nasalis), which, with a corresponding ridge in the opposite bone, forms a groove for the reception of the vomer. The prolongation of this ridge forwards beyond the level of the facial surface of the bone is the nasal spine. At the anterior extremity of its nasal surface is a foramen, which leads into a canal formed conjointly by the two superior maxillary bones, the anterior palatine canal. The termi- nation of this canal is situated immediately behind the incisor teeth, hence it is also named the incisive foramen. Associated with the incisive canal are two smaller canals, the naso-palatine, which transmit the naso-palatine nerves. The naso-palatine canals are situated in the walls of the incisive canal, and terminate inferiorly in that canal, either by separate openings or conjoined. Development.—four centres : one for the anterior part of the palate and incisive portion of the alveolar process (the permanence of this piece constitutes the intermaxillary bone of animals) ; one for that portion of the bone lying internally to the infraorbital canal and foramen ; one for that portion lying externally to the infra- orbital groove and canal; and one for the palate process. The superior maxillary bone is one of the earliest to show signs of ossifi- cation, this action beginning in the alveolar process, and being associated with the early development of teeth. The early develop- ment of the alveolar process, and the consequent fusion at this point of the original pieces, explains the difiiculties which have been felt by anatomists in determining the precise number of ossifying centres of this bone.47 MALAR BONES. Articulations.—With, nine bones; viz, two of the cranium, and all the bones of the face, excepting the inferior maxillary. These are, the frontal and ethmoid; nasal, lachrymal, malar, inferior turbi- nated, palate, vomer, and its fellow of the opposite side. Attachment of Muscles.—To ten; orbicularis palpebrarum, obli- quus inferior oculi, levator labii superioris alseque nasi, levator labii superioris proprius, levator anguli oris, compressor nasi, dilatator naris, depressor alse nasi, bucciuator, masseter. Lachrymal Bones (os unguis, from an imagined resemblance to a finger nail),—The lachrymal is a thin oval-shaped plate of bone, situated in front and at the inner angle of the orbit. It may be divided into an external and internal surface and four borders. The external surface is 30 * smooth and marked by a vertical ridge, the lachrymal crest, into two portions, one of whicb is flat and enters into the formation of the orbit, hence may be called the orbital portion; the other is concave, and lodges the lachrymal sac, hence, the lachrymal portion. The crest is expanded inferiorly into a hook- shaped process (hamulus lachrymalis), which forms part of the outer boundary of the fossa lachrymalis. The internal surface is uneven, and conc^pletes the anterior ethmoid cells; it assists also in forming the wall of the nasal fossae and nasal duct. The four borders articulate with adjoining bones. Development.—By a single centre, appearing in the early part of the tiikd month. Articulations.—"With four bones; two of the cranium, frontal and ethmoid; and two of the face, superior maxillary and inferior tur- binated bone. Attachment of Muscles.—To one muscle, the tensor tarsi, and to an expansion of the tendo oculi, the former arising from the orbital surface, the other being attached to the lachrymal crest. Malar Bones {mala, the cheek).—The malar (os jugale) is the strong quadrangular bone which forms the prominence of the cheek. It is divisible into an external and internal surface, and four pro- cesses, frontal, orbital, maxillary, and zygomatic.

The internal surface is concave, partly smooth and partly rough; smooth where it forms part of the temporal fossa, and rough where it ar- ticulates with the superior maxillary bone. ^h.efrontal process ascends perpendicularly to form the outer border of the orbit, and articulate with the external angular process of the frontal bone. The orbital process is a thick plate, which projects inwards from the frontal pro- cess, and unites with the great ala of the. sphenoid to constitute the outer wall of the orbit. It is pierced "by several small foramina for the passage of temporo-malar filaments of the superior maxillary nerve. The maxillary pjrocess is broad, and articulates with the superior maxillary bone. The zijgo-^ matic jirocess, narrower than the rest, projects backwards to unite with the zygoma of the temporal bone. Development.—By a single centre; in rare instances by two or three. In many animals the malar bone is permanently divided into two portions, orbital and malar. Ossification commences in the malar bone soon after the vertebrae. Articulatiotis.—With/oitr bones: three of the cranium, frontal, temporal, and sphenoid; and one of the face, superior maxillary. Attachment of Muscles.—To five: levator labii superioris proprius, zygomaticus minor and major, masseter, and temporal. Palate Bones.—The palate bones are situated at the posterior part of the nares, where they enter into the formation of the palate, side of the nose, and posterior part of the floor of the orbit; hence they might be named the palato-naso-orbital bones. Each bone re- sembles in general form the letter L, and is divisible into a hori- zontal plate, a pei'pendicular plate, and a pterygoid j)rocess or tuberosity. The horizontal plate is quadrilateral; and presents two surfaces, one superior, which enters into the formation of the floor of the * The malar bone of the right side. 1. External surface. 2.

The superior surface is con- cave, and rises towards the middle line, ^ff- where it unites with its fellow of the opposite side and forms part of a crest (crista nasalis), which articulates with the vomer. The inferior surface is uneven, and marked by a slight trans- verse ridge, to which is attached the tendinous expansion of the tensor palati muscle. Near its external border are two openings, one large and one small, t'h.Q posterior palatine foramina; the former transmits the anterior palatine nerve and superior palatine artery, the latter the middle palatine nerve. The posterior border is concave, and pre- sents at its inner extremity a sharp point, which with a corresponding point in the opposite bone con - stitutes the palate spine for the attachment of the azygos uvul* muscle. The perpendicular plate is also quadrilateral; and presents two surfaces, one internal or nasal, forming a part of the wall of the nares; the other external, bounding the spheno-maxillary fossa and antrum. The internal surface is marked near its middle by a hori- zontal ridge {crista turbinalis inferior), to which is united the in- ferior turbinated bone; and, at about half an inch above this, by another ridge (crista turbinalis superior), for the attachment of the middle turbinated bone. The concave surface below the inferior ridge iS the lateral boundary of the inferior meatus of the nose ; that between the two ridges corresponds with the middle meatus, and the surface above the superior ridge with the superior meatus. The external surface, extremely irregular, is rough on each side for arti- culation with neighbouring bones, and smooth in the middle to con- stitute the inner boundary of the spheno-maxillary fossa.

EPALATE BONES. 50 smooth surface terminates inferiorly in a deep groove, which, being completed by the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone and pterygoid process of the sphenoid, forms the posterior palatine canal. Near the upper part of the perpendicular plate is a large oval notch completed by the sphenoid, the spheno-palatine foramen, which transmits the superior nasal and naso-palatine nerves and spheno- palatine artery, and serves to divide the upper extremity of the bone into two portions, an anterior or orbital, and a posterior or sphe- noidal portion. The orbital portion is hollow within, and presents five surfaces externally, three articular, and two free; the three articular are, anterior, which looks forward and articulates with the superior maxillary bone, internal with the ethmoid, and posterior with the sphenoid. The free surfaces are, superior or orbital, which forms the posterior part of the floor of the orbit, and external, which looks into the spheno-maxillary fossa. The sphenoidal portion, much smaller than the orbital, has three Fig. 33.* surfaces, two lateral and one superior. The external lateral surface enters .- . S-"i-''^'9 into the formation of the spheno- maxillary fossa; the internal lateral forms part of the lateral boundary of the nares; and the superior surface articulates with the under part of the body of the sphenoid bone, and assists the sphenoidal spongy bones in closing the sphenoidal sinuses. This portion takes part in the formation of the pterygo-palatine canal. 1h.e pterygoid process or tuberosity of the palate bone is the thick and rough process which stands backwards from the angle of union of the hori- zontal with the perpendicular portion of the bone. It is received into the angular fissure, which exists between the two plates of the pterygoid process at their inferior extremity, and presents three surfaces: one concave and smooth, which forms part of the ptery- goid fossa; and one at each side to articulate with the pterygoid * The perpendicular plate of the right palate bone, seen on its external or spheno-maxiUary" surface. 1.

Development.—By a single centre, which appears in the angle of union between the horizontal and perpendicular portion, at the same time as ossification in the vertebrae. Articulations.—With six bones: two of the cranium, sphenoid and ethmoid; and four of the face, superior maxillary, inferior tur- binated, vomer, and the palate bone of the opposite side. Attachment of Muscles.—To four: tensor palati, azygos uvulse, internal and external pterygoid. Inferior turbinated Bones.—The inferior turbinated or spongy bone, is a thin layer of light and porous bone, attached to the crista turbinalis inferior of the inner wall of the nares, and pro- jecting inwards towards the ^9- 34. septum narium. It is some- what triangular in form, one angle being directed upwards and the curved base down- wards; and slightly curled upon itself, so as to bear some resemblance to one valve of a bivalve shell, hence its desig- nation, concha inferior. The bone presents for examination two surfaces, internal and external; three borders, anterior, superior, and inferior; and three angles, anterior, posterior, and superior. The internal or convex surface looks inwards and upwards, and forms the inferior boundary of iJie middle meatus naris; it is marked by one or two longitudinal grooves or canals for branches of the nasal nerves and spheno-palatine artery. The external or concave surface looks downwards and outwards, and constitutes the roof of the inferior meatus. The anterior border looks upwards and forwards, is thin and somewhat concave, and articulates with the crista turbinalis of the superior maxillary and with the lachrymal bone. The superior border, long and uneven, articulates with the crista turbinalis of the palate bone, and with the superior maxillary.

The superior angle, more or less rounded, gives origin to three thin and laminated processes. The most ante- rior of these processes, processus lachrymalis, derived from the upper extremity of the ajit^rior border, articulates with the lachry- mal bone, and assists in completing the nasal duct; the posterior process, pjrocessus ethmoidalis, derived directly from the superior angle or border, often from both, articulates with the ethmoid bone; the middle process, processus maxillaris, proceeding also from the superior border, is reflected downwards, and assists in completing the inner wall of the antrum, articulating with the superior maxil- lary and palate bone. Development.—By a single centre, which appears at about the middle of the first year. It affords no attachment to muscles. Articulations.—"With four bones : ethmoid, superior maxillary, lachrymal, and palate. Vomer.—The vomer is a thin, quadrilateral plate of bone, forming the posterior and inferior part of the septum of the nares. The superior border is broad and expand- ed, to articulate, in the middle, with the under surface of the body of the sphenoid, and on each side (ala) with v. ^ ^ the processus vaginalis of the pterygoid pro- cess. The anterior part of this border is hol- lowed into a sheath for the reception of the rostrum of the sphenoid. The inferior border is thin and un- even, and is received into the grooved summit of the crista na- salis. The posterior border is sharp and free, and forms the pos- terior division of the two nares. The anterior border is more or less deeply grooved for the reception of the central lamella of the ethmoid and the cartilage of the septum. This groove is an indication of the early constitution of the bone of two lamellEe, united at the inferior . * The vomer viewed on its left aspect. 1,1.

The vomer not unfrequently presents a convexity to one or the other side, generally, it is said, to the left. Development.—By a single centre, which makes its appearance at the same time with those of the vertebr£e. Ossification begins from below and proceeds upwards. At birth, the vomer presents the form of a trough, in the concavity of which the cartilage of the septum nasi is placed; it is this disposition which subsequently enables the bone to embrace the rostrum of the sphenoid. The vomer has no muscles attached to it. Articulations.—With six bones: sphenoid, ethmoid, two superior maxillary, two palate; and the cartilage of the septum. Ineerior maxillary Bone.—The lower jaw is the arch of bone which contains the inferior teeth; it is divisible into a horizontal portion or body, and a perpendicular portion, the ramus, at each side. Upon the external swface of the body of the bone, at the middle line, and extending from between the two first incisor teeth to the chin, is a slight ridge, crista mentalis, which indicates the point of conjunction of the lateral halves of the bone in the young subject, the symphisis. Immediately external to this ridge is a depression which gives origin to the depressor labii inferioris muscle; and, cor- responding with the root of the lateral incisor tooth, another depres- sion, the incisive fossa, for the levator labii inferioris. Farther out- wards is an oblique opening, the mental foramen, for the exit of the mental nerve and inferior dental artery; and below this foramen, the commencement of an oblique ridge, which runs upwards and out- wards to the base of the coronoid process, and gives attachment to the depressor anguli oris, platysma myoides, and buccinator muscle. Near the posterior part of this surface is a rough impression made by the masseter muscle; and immediately in front of this impression, a groove for the facial artery. The projecting tuberosity at the posterior extremity of the lower jaw, at the point where the body and ramus meet, is the angle. Upon the internal surface of the lody of the bone, at the sym- phisis, are two small pointed tubercles; immediately beneath these, two other tubercles, less marked; beneath them a ridge, and beneath the ridge two rough depressions of some size. These four points give attachment, from above downwards, to the genio-hyo-glossi, genio- hyoidei, part of the mylo-hyoidei, and digastric muscles. Running outwards into the body of the bone from the above ridge is a pro- minent line, the mylo-hyoidean ridge, which gives attachment to the mylo-hyoideus muscle, and by its extremity to the pterygo-maxillary ligament and superior constrictor muscle. Immediately above the ridge, and by the side of the symphisis, is a smooth concave surface, which corresponds with the sublingual gland; and below the ridge, and more externally, a deeper fossa for the submaxillary gland.54 INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE. The superior border of tlie body of the bone is the alveolar process, furnished in the adult with alveoli for sixteen teeth. The inferior border or base is rounded and smooth; thick and everted in front to form the chin, and thin behind where it merges into the angle of the bone. The ramus is a strong square-shaped process, differing in direction at various periods of life ; thus, in the foetus and infant, it is almost parallel with the body; in youth it is oblique, and gradually ap- proaches the vertical direction until manhood; in old age, after the loss of the teeth, it again declines, and assumes the oblique direc- tion. Upon its external surface it is rough, for the attachment of the masseter muscle; and at the junction of its posterior border with the body of the bone is a rough tuberosity, the angle of the lower jaw, which gives attachment by its inner margin to the stylo-maxil- lary ligament. The upper extremity of the ramus presents two processes, sepa- rated by a concave sweep, the sigmoid notch. The anterior is the coronoid process; it is sharp and pointed, and gives attachment by its inner surface to the tem- poral muscle. The ante- rior border of the coro- noid process is grooved at its lower part for the buccinator muscle. The posterior process is the condyle oithe lower jaw, which is flattened from before backwards, ob- lique in direction, and smooth upon its upper surface, to articulate with the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone. The constriction around the base of the con- dyle is its oiecJc, into which is inserted the external pterygoid muscle. The sigmoid notch is crossed by the masseteric artery and nerve. The internal surface of the ramus is marked near its centre by a large oblique foramen, the inferior dental, for the entrance of the * The lower jaw. 1. Tliebody. 2. The ramus, 3. The symphisis. 4.

Bounding this opening is a sharp margin, to which is attached the internal lateral ligament, and passing downwards from the opening a narrow groove which lodges the mylo-hyoidean nerve with a small artery and vein. To the uneven surface above and in front of the inferior dental foramen, is attached the temporal muscle, and to that below it, the internal pterygoid. The internal surface of the neck of the condyle gives attachment to the external pterygoid muscle ; and the angle to the stylo-maxillary ligament. Development.—By tioo centres; one for each lateral half, the two sides meeting at the symphisis, where they become united. The lower jaw is the earliest of the bones of the skeleton to exhibit ossification, with the exception of the clavicle; ossific union of the symphisis takes place during the first year. Articulations.—With the glenoid fossse of the two temporal bones, through the medium of a fibro-cartilage. Attachment of Muscles.—To fourteen pairs ; by the external sur- face, commencing at the symphisis and proceeding outwards, levator labii inferioris, depressor labii inferioris, depressor anguli oris, pla- tysma myoides, buccinator, and masseter; by the internal surface, also commencing at the symphisis, the genio-hyo-glossus, genio- hyoideus, mylo-hyoideus, digastricus, superior constrictor, temporal, external pterygoid, and internal pterygoid.

The bones of the cranium and face are connected with each other by means of sutures (sutura, a seam), of which there are four prin- cipal varieties: serrated, squamous, harmonia, and schindylesis.56 SUTURES—OSSA TKIQUETRA. The serrated suture is formed by the union of two borders possess- ing serrated edges, as in the coronal, sagittal, and lambdoid sutures. In these sutures the serrations are formed almost wholly by the ex- ternal table, the edges of the internal table lying merely in apposition. The squamous suture {squama, a scale) is formed by the overlap- ping of the bevelled edges of two contiguous bones, as in the articu- lation between the temporal and lower border of the parietal. In this suture the approximated surfaces are roughened, so as to adhere mechanically with each other. The harmonia suture (dpelv, to adapt) is the simple apposition of contiguous surfaces, the surfaces being more or less rough and reten- tive. This suture is seen in the connexion between the superior maxillary bones, or of the palate processes of the palate bones with each other. The schindylesis suture {(rxivdv\r](rLQ, a fissure) is the reception of one bone into a sheath or fissure of another, as occurs in the arti- culation of the rostrum of the sphenoid with the vomer, or of the latter with the perpendicular lamella of the ethmoid, and with the crista nasalis of the superior maxillary and palate bones. The serrated suture is formed by the interlocking of the radiating fibres along the edges of the flat bones of the cranium during growth. When this process is retarded by overdistention of the head, as in hydrocephalus, and sometimes without any such apparent cause, distinct ossific centres are developed in the interval between the edges; and, being surrounded by the suture, form independent pieces, which are called ossa triquetra, or ossa Wormiana. In the lambdoid suture there is generally one or more of these bones; and, in a beau- tiful adult hydrocephalic skeleton* in the College of Surgeons, there are upw-ai'ds of one hundred. The coronal suture (fig. 37) extends transversely across the vertex of the skull, from the upper part of the greater wing of the sphenoid of one side to the same point on the opposite side; it connects the frontal with the parietal bones. In the formation of this suture the edges of the articulating bones are bevelled, so that the parietal rest upon the frontal at each side, and in the middle the frontal rests upon the parietal bones; they thus aff'ord to each other mutual sup- port and increased consolidation to the skull. The sagittal suture extends longitudinally backwards along the • vertex of the skull, from the middle of the coronal to the apex of the lambdoid suture. It is much serrated, and serves to unite the two parietal bones. In the young subject, and sometimes in the adult, this suture is continued through the middle of the frontal bone to the root of the nose, under the name of the frontal suture. Ossa triquetra are sometimes found in the sagittal suture. The lambdoid suture is named from some resemblance to the Greek letter A, consisting of two branches, which diverge at an acute angle from the extremity of the sagittal suture. This suture connects the * This skeleton belonged to IMr. Listen.57 SUPERIOR REGION OP THE SKULL. ' occipital with the parietal bones. At the posterior and inferior angle of the parietal bones, the lambdoid suture is continued onwards in a curved direction into the base of the skull, and serves to unite the occipital bone with the mastoid portion of the temporal, under the name of additamentum sutiirce lambdoidalis. It is in the lambdoid suture that ossa triquetra occur most frequently. The squamous suture (fig. 37) unites the squamous portion of the temporal bone with the greater ala of the sphenoid, and with the parietal, overlapping the lower border of the latter. The portion of the suture which is continued backwards from the squamous portion of the bone to the lambdoid suture, and connects the mastoid portion with the posterior inferior angle of the parietal, is the additamentum suturce squamosce. The additamentum suturaJ lambdoidalis, and additamentum suturae squamosse, constitute together the mastoid suture. Across the upper part of the face is an irregular suture, the trans- verse, which connects the frontal bone with the nasal, superior max- illary, lachrymal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and malar bones. The remain- ing sutures are too unimportant to deserve particular names or description, REGIONS OP THE SKULL, The fekull, considered as a whole, is divisible into four regions : a superior region or vertex; a lateral region; an inferior region or base; and an anterior region, the face. The SUPERIOR REGION, or vertex of the skull, is bounded ante- riorly by the frontal eminences; on each side by the temporal ridges and parietal eminences; and behind by the superior curved line of the occipital bone and occipital protuberance. It is crossed trans- versely by the coronal suture, and marked from before backwards by the sagittal, which terminates posteriorly in the lambdoid suture. Near the posterior extremity of the region, and on each side of ^the sagittal suture, is the parietal foramen. Upon the inner or cerebral surface of this region is a shallow groove, extending along the middle line from before backwards, for the superior longitudinal sinus; on either side of this groove are several small foss® for the Pacchionian bodies, and farther outwards, digital foss83 corresponding with the convexities of the convolutions, and numerous ramified markings for lodging the branches of the arteria meningea media. The LATERAL REGION of the skuU is divisible into three portions; temporal, mastoid, and zygomatic. The temporal portion, or temporal fossa, is bounded above and behind by the temporal ridge, in front by the external angular process of the frontal bone and by the malar bone, and below by the zygoma. It is formed by part of the frontal, great wing of the sphenoid, parietal,LATEKAL REGION OP THE SKULL. 58 squamous portion of tlie temporal, malar bone, and zygoma, and lodges tte temporal mnscle "^^dtli the deep temporal arteries and nerves, Tlie mastoid 2^ortion is rough, for the attachment of muscles. Upon its posterior part is the mastoid foramen; and below, the mas- toid process. In front of the mastoid process is the external auditory- foramen, surrounded by the external auditory process; and in front of this foramen the glenoid cavity, bounded above by the middle root of the zygoma, and in front by its tubercle. The zygomatic portion or fossa is the irregular cavity below the zygoma, bounded in front by the superior maxillary bone, internally by the external pterygoid plate, above by part of the great ^ing of the sphenoid, squamous portion of the temporal bone, and temporal fossa; and externally by the zygomatic arch and ramus of the lower * A front view of the skull. 1.

Fig. 37.*BASE OP THE SKTJLL, 59 jaw. It contains the external pterygoid, part of the temporal, and internal pterygoid muscle, the internal maxillary artery and inferior maxillary nerve, with their branches. On the inner side and upper -paxt of the zygomatic fossa are two fissures, spheno-maxillary and ptery go-maxillary. The spheno-maxillary fissure, horizontal in direc- tion, opens into the orbit,* and is situated between the great ala of the sphenoid and the superior maxillary bone. It is completed externally by the malar bone. The pterygo-maxillary fissure is vertical, and descends at a right angle from the extremity of the preceding. It is situated between the pterygoid process and the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, and transmits the internal maxillary artery. At the angle of junction of these two fissures is a small space, the spheno-maxillary fossa, bounded by the sphenoid, palate, and superior maxillary bone. In this space are seen the openings of five foramina: foramen rotundum, spheno-palatine, pterygo-palatine, posterior palatine, and Vidian. The spheno-maxil- lary fossa lodges Meckel's ganglion and the termination of the internal maxillary artery. The BASE OF THE SKULL presents an internal or cerebral, and an external or basilar surface. The cerebral surface is divisible into three parts, which are named the anterior, middle, and posterior fossa of the base of the cranium. The anterior fossa is somewhat convex on each side, where it corre- sponds with the roofs of the orbits; and concave in the middle, in the situation of the ethmoid bone and anterior part of the body of the sphenoid. The latter and the lesser wings constitute its posterior boundary. It supports the anterior lobes of the cerebrum. In the middle line of this fossa, at its anterior part, is the crista gallij im- mediately in front of that process, the foramen ccBCum; and on each side the cribriform plate, with its foramina, for the transmission of the filaments of the olfactory and nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. Farther back in the middle line is the processm olivaris, and on the sides of this process the optic foramina, anterior and middle clinoidprocesses, and vertical grooves for the internal carotid arteries. The middle fossa of the base, deeper than the preceding, is bounded in front by the lesser wing of the sphenoid; behind, by the petrous portion of the temporal bone; and is divided into two lateral parts by the sella turcica. It is formed by the posterior part of the body, great ala, and spinous process of the sphenoid, and by the petrous and squamous portion of the temporal bones. In the centre of this fossa is the sella turcica, which lodges the pituitary gland^ bounded in front by the anterior and middle, and behind by the dorsm)% ephippii Sind posterior clinoid processes. On each side of the sella turcica is the carotid groove for the internal carotid artery, cavernous plexus of nerves, cavernous sinus, and orbital nerves; ^ and a little farther outwards the following foramina, from before backwards: sphenoidal fissure (foramen lacerum an- terius) for the transmission of the third, fourth, three branches ofBASE OF THE SKULL. 60 the ophthalmic division of the fifth, and the sixth nerve, and oph- thalmic vein ; foramen rotundwni, for the superior maxillary nerve; foramen ovale, for the inferior maxillary nerve, arteria meningea parva, and nervus petrosas snperficialis minor; foramen spinosum, for the arteria meningea media; foramen laceriim basis cranii, which gives passage to the internal carotid artery, carotid plexns, and petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve. On the anterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone is a groove, leading to a fissured opening, the hiatus Fallopii, for the petrosal branch of the Fig. 38.* * The cerebral surface of the base of the skull. 1.

Towards the apex of the petrous portion is the notch for the fifth nerve, and below it a slight depression for the Casserian ganglion. Farther outwards is the eminence which marks the position of the perpendicular semi- circular canal. Proceeding from the foramen spinosum are two grooves, which indicate the course of the trunks of the arteria me- ningea media. The whole fossa lodges the middle lobes of the cerebrum. The posterim- fossa, larger than the other two, is formed by the occipital bone, petrous and mastoid portion of the temporals, and by a small part of the sphenoid and parietals. It is bounded in front by the upper border of the petrous portion and dorsum ephippii, and along its posterior circumference by the groove for the lateral sinuses ; it gives support to the pons Varolii, medulla oblongata, and cere- bellum. In the centre of this fossa is the foramen magnum, bounded on each side by a rough tubercle, which gives attachment to the odontoid ligament, and by the anterior condyloid foramen. In front of the foramen magnum is the concave surface (clivus Blumen- bachii) which supports the medulla oblongata and pons Varolii, and on each side the following foramina, from before backwards. The internal auditoin^ foramen, for the auditory and facial nerve and auditory artery; behind, and externally to this, is a small foramen leading into the aquceductus vestibuli; and below it, partly con- cealed by the edge of the petrous bone, the aquceductus cochlece; next, 8) long fissure, the foraraen lacerum posterius, or jugTilar forameii, giving passage externally to the commencement of the in- ternal jugular vein, and internally to the eighth pair of nerves. Converging towards this foramen from behind is the deep groove for the lateral sinus, and from the front the groove for the inferior petrosal sinus. Behind the foramen magnum is a longitudinal ridge, which gives attachment to the falx cerebelli, and divides the two inferior fossee of the occipital bone; and above the ridge is the internal occipital protuberance and the transverse groove lodging the lateral sinus. The external surface of the base of the skuU is extremely uneven. From before backwards it is formed by the palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate bones; the vomer; pterygoid, spinous processes, and part of the body of the sphenoid; under surface of the squamous, petrous, and mastoid portion of the temporals; and by the occipital bone. The palate processes of the superior maxillaiy and palate bones constitute the hard palate, which is raised above the level of the rest of the base, and is surrounded by the alveolar processes containing the teeth of the upper jaw. At the anterior extremity of the hard palate, and directly behind the front incisor teeth, is the anterior palatine or incisive foramen, the termination of the anterior palatine canal, which transmits the naso-palatine nerves. At the posterior angles of the palate are the posteriorBASE OF THE SKULL. 62 palatine foramina, for the palatine nerves and arteries. Passings inwards from these foramina are the transverse ridges, to which ar^ attached the aponeurotic expansions of the tensor palati muscles and at the middle line of the posterior border, the palate spine, which gives origin to the azygos uvulse. The hard palate is marked by a crucial suture, which distinguishes the four processes of which it is composed.

At the base of the pterygoid processes are the pterygo-palatine canals. The internal pterygoid plate is long and narrow, terminated at its apex by the hamular process, and at its base by the scaphoid fossa. The external plate is broad; the space between the two is the pterygoid fossa; it contains part of the internal pterygoid muscle, and the tensor palati. Externally to the external pterygoid plate is the zygomatic fossa. Behind the nasal foss83, in the middle line, is the under surface of the body of the sphenoid, and the basilar process of the occipital bone, and still farther back, the foramen magnum. At the base of the external pterygoid plate, on each side, is the foramen ovale, and behind this the foramen spinosum with the prominent spine which gives attach- ment to the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw and laxator tympani muscle. Running outwards from the apex of the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, is the fissura Glaseri, which crosses the glenoid fossa transversely, and divides it into an anterior smooth surface, bounded by the eminentia articularis, for the condyle of the lower jaw, and a posterior rough surface for a part of the parotid gland. Behind the foramen ovale and spinosum, is the irregular fissure between the spinous process of the sphenoid bone and the petrous portion of the temporal, the foramen lacerum anterius basis cranii, which lodges the internal carotid artery and Eustachian tube, and in which the carotid branch of the Vidian nerve joins the carotid plexus. Following the direction of this fissure outwards we see the foramen for the Eustachian tube, and that for the tensor tympani muscle, separated from each 'other by the processus cochlearif ormis. Behind the fissure is the pointed process of the petrous bone which gives origin to the levator palati muscle, and, externally to this process, the carotid foramen for the transmission of the internal carotid artery and ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic; and behind the carotid foramen, the foramen lacerum posterius basis cranii and jugular fossa. Externally, and somewhat in front of the latter, is the styloid process, and at its base the vaginal process. Behind and at the root of the styloid process is the stylo-mastoid foramen, for the facial nerve and stylo- mastoid artery, and farther outwards the mastoid process. Upon the inner side of the root of the mastoid process is the digastric fossa; and a little farther inwards, the occipital groove. On the sides of the foramen magnum, and near its anterior circumference, are the condyles of the occipital bone. In front of each condyle, and piercing its base, is the anterior condyloid foramen for the hypoglossal nerve, and directly behind the condyle the irregular fossa in which the posterior condyloid foramen is situated. Behind the foramen magnum are the two curved lines of the occipital bone, the spine, and the protuberance, with the rough surfaces for the at- tachment of muscles. The Face is somewhat oval in contour, uneven in surface, and excavated for the reception of two principal organs of sense, the eyeORBITS. 64 and the nose. It is formed by part of the frontal bone and by the bones of the face. Superiorly it is bounded by the frontal eminences; beneath these are the superciliary ridges, converging towards the nasal tuberosity; beneath the superciliary ridges are the supra- orbital ridges, terminating externally in the external border of the orbit, and internally in the internal border, and j^resenting towards their inner third the supraorbital notch, -for the supraorbital nerve and artery. Beneath the supraorbital ridges are the openings of the orbits. Between the orbits is the bridge of the nose, over- arching the anterior nares; and on each side of this opening the canine fossa of the superior maxillary bone, the infraorbital foramen, and still farther outwards the prominence of the malar bone; at the lower margin of the anterior nares is the nasal spine, and beneath this the superior alveolar arch, containing the teeth of the upper jaw. Forming the lower boundary of the face is the lower jaw, containing in its alveolar process the lower teeth, and projecting inferiorly to form the chin; on either side of the chin is the mental foramen. If a perpendicular line be drawn from the inner third of the supraorbital ridge to the inner third of the body of the lower jaw, it will be found to intersect three openings ; the supraorbital, infraorbital, and mental, each giving passage to a facial branch of the fifth nerve. The orbits are two quadrilateral hollow cones, situated in the upper part of the face, and intended for the reception of the eye- balls, "ttith their muscles, vessels, and nerves, and the lachrymal glands. The central axis of each orbit is directed outwards, so that the axes of the two, continued into the skull through the optic foramina, would intersect over the middle of the sella turcica. The mperim' boundary of the orbit is formed by the orbital plate of the frontal bone, and part of the lesser wing of the sphenoid; the in- ferior, by part of the malar bone and the orbital processes of the superior maxillary and palate bone ; the internal, by the lachrymal bone, OS planum of the ethmoid, and part of the body of the sphe- noid ; and the external, by the orbital process of the malar bone and great ala of the sphenoid.

NASAL FOSS^. The nasal foss^ are two irregular cavities, situated in the middle of the face, and extending from before backwards. They are bounded above by the nasal bones, ethmoid, and sphenoid; below by the palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate bones ; externally by the superior maxillary, lachrymal, inferior turbinated, superior and middle turbinated bones of the ethmoid, palate, and internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid; and the two fossae are sepa- rated by the vomer and perpendicular lamella of the ethmoid.

The mperior meatus occupies the superior and posterior part of each fossa: it is situated between the superior and middle turbinated bone, and has opening into it three foramina, viz. the opening of the posterior eth- moid cells, the opening of the sphenoid cells, and the spheno-palatine foramen. The middle meatus is the space between the middle and -inferior turbinated bone; it also presents three forainina, the open- ing of the frontal sinus, of the anterior ethmoid cells, and of the antrum. The largest of the three passages is the inferior meatus, which is the space between the inferior turbinated bone and the floor of the nasal fossa; in it there are two foramina, the termination of the nasal duct, and one opening of the anterior palatine canal. The nasal fossae commence upon the face by a large irregular opening, the anterior nares, and terminate posteriorly in the two posterior nares. * A longitudinal section of the nasal fossae made immediately to the right of the middle line, and the bony septum removed in order to show the external wall of the left fossa. 1.

Man is provided with two successions of teeth : the first are the teeth of childhood; they are called temporary, deciduous, or milk teeth; the second continue until old age, and are named permanent. The permanent teeth are thirty-two in number, sixteen in each jaw; they are divisible into four classes: incisors, of which there are four in each jaw, two central and two lateral; canine, two above and two below; bicuspid, four above and four below; and molars, six above and six below. The temporary teetli are twenty in number: eight incisors, four canine, and eight molars. The temporary molars have four tubercles, and are succeeded by the permanent bicuspides, which have only two tubercles. Each tooth is divisible into a croion, which is the part apparent above the gum; a constricted portion around the base of the crown, the neck; and a root or fang, which is contained within the alveolus. The root is invested by periosteum, which lines the alveolus, and is at the same time adherent to the root of the tooth. The incisor teetJi (cutting teeth) are named from presenting a sharp and cutting edge, formed at the expense of the posterior surface. The crown is flattened from before backwards, being somewhat convex in front and concave behind; the neck is much constricted, and the' root compressed from side to side; at its apex is a small opening for the passage of the nerve and artery of the tooth. The canine teeth (cuspidati) follow the incisors in order from be- fore backwards; two are situated in the upper jaw, one on each side, and two in the lower. The crown is larger than that of the incisors, convex before, concave behind, and tapering to a blunted point. The root is longer than that of all the other teeth, compressed at each side, and marked by a slight groove. The bicuspid teeth (bicuspidati, small molars), two on each side in each jaw, follow the canine, and are intermediate in size between them and the molars.

The teeth of the upper jaw have a greater tendency to the division of their roots than those of the lower, and the posterior than the anterior pair. The molar teeth (multicuspidati, grinders), three on each side in each jaw, are the largest of the permanent set. The cro'RTi is quadrilateral, and surmounted by four tubercles, the neck large and round, and the root divided into several fangs. In the upper jaw the first and second molar teeth have three roots, sometimes four, which are more or less widely separated from each other, two of the roots being external, the other internal. In the lower there are but two roots, which are anterior and posterior; they are flattened from behind foi"wards, and grooved so as to mark a tendency to division. The third molars, or dentes sapientise, are smaller than the other two ; they present three tubercles on the surface of the crown; and the root is single and grooved, appearing to be made up of four or five fangs conpressed together, or partially divided. In the lower jaw the fangs are frequently separated to some distance from each other, and much curved, so as to offer considerable resistance in the operation of extraction. Structure.—The base of the croTvn of each tooth is hollowed in its interior into a small cavity v/hich is continuous with a canal passing through the middle of each fang. The cavity and canal, or canals, constitute the cavitas pulpse, and contain a soft cellulo- vascular organ, the pulp, which receives its supply of vessels and nerves through the small opening at the apex of each root. T\Ir. Nasmyth has observed, with regard to the pulp, that it is composed of two different tissues, vascular and reticular, the former being an intricate web of minute vessels terminating in simple capillary loops; the latter, a network of nucleated cells in which calcareous salts are gradually deposited, and which by a systematic continuance of that process are gradually converted into ivory. This process natu- rally takes place at the surface of the pulp, and as the pulp is thus robbed of its cells, new cells are produced by the capillary plexus to supply their place, and be in their turn similarly transformed. A tooth is composed of three distinct structures, ivory or tooth- l)one, enamel, and a cortical substance or cementum. When viewed with the microscope, the ivory appears to consist of very minute, tapering, and branching fibres, imbedded in a dense, homogeneous, interfibrous substance. The fibres commence by their larger ends in the walls of the cavitas pulpre, and pursue a radiating and serpen- tine course towards the periphery of the tooth, where they teiminate in ramifications of extreme minuteness. These fibres, heretofore considered as hollow tubuli, have been shown by Mr. Nasmyth to be rows of minute opake bodies, arranged in a linear series (baccated fibres), to be, in fact, the nuclei of the ivory cells, the intei-fibrous substance being the rest of the cell filled with calcareous matter. In the natural state of the tooth aU trace of the parietes or mode of69 DEVELOPMENT OP TEETH. connection of the cells is lost, but, after steeping in weak acid, the cellular network is rendered distinct. The enamel forms a crust over the whole exposed surface of the crown of the tooth to the commencement of its root; it is thickest over the upper part of the crown, and becomes gradually thinner as it approaches the neck. It is composed of minute hexagonal crystal- line fibres, resting by one extremity against the surface of the ivory, and constituting by the other the free surface of the crown. The fibres, examined on the face of a longitudinal section, have a waving arrangement, and consist, like those of ivory, of cells connected by their surfaces and ends, and filled with calcareous substance. When the latter is removed by weak acid, the enamel presents a delicate cellular network of animal matter. The cortical substance, or cementum (substantia ostoidea) forms a thin coating over the root of the tooth, from the termination of the enamel to the opening in the apex of the fang. In structure it is analogous to bone, and is characterized by the presence of numerous Purkinjean cells and tubuli. The cementum increases in thickness with the advance of age, and gives rise to those exostosed appear- ances occasionally seen in the teeth of very old persons, or in those who have taken much mercury. In old age the cavitas pulpfe is often found filled up and obliterated by osseous substance analogous to the cementum. Mr. Nasmyth has shown that this, like the other structures composing a tooth, is formed of cells having a reticular arrangement. Development.—^The development of the teeth in the human sub- ject has been successfully investigated by Mr. Groodsir,* whose in- quiries commenced as early as the sixth week after concej)tion, in an embryo, which measured seven lines and a half in length,- and weighed fifteen grains. At this early period each upper jaw presents two semicircular folds around its cu-cumference; the most external is the true lip; the internal, the rudiment of the palate; and be- tween these is a deep groove, lined by the common mucous membrane of the mouth. A little later, a ridge is developed from the floor of this groove in a direction from behind forwards; this is the rudiment of the external alveolus; and the arrangement of the appearances from without inwards at this period is the following: Most ex- ternally, and forming the boundary of the mouth, is the lip; next we find a deep groove, which separates the lip from the future jaw; then comes the external alveolar ridge; fourthly, another groove, in which the germs of the teeth are developed, the primitive dental groove; fifthly, a rudiment of the internal alveolar ridge; and, sixthly, the rudiment of the f uture palate bounding the whole in- ternally. At the seventh week the germ of the first deciduous molar of the upper jaw has made its appearance, in the form of a "simple, * " On the Origin and Development of the Pulps and Sacs of the Human Teeth," by John Goodsir, jun., in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, January, 1839.DEVELOPMENT OF TEETH, ^0 free, granular papilla" of tlie mucotis membrane, projecting from the floor of the primitive dental groove; at the eighth week, the papilla of the canine tooth is developed; at the ninth week, the papillae of the four incisors (the middle preceding the lateral) appear; and at the tenth week, the papilla of the second molar is seen be- hind the anterior molar in the primitive dental groove. So that at this early period, the tenth week, the papillae or germs of the whole ten deciduous teeth of the upper jaw are quite distinct. Those of the lower jaw are a little more tardy; the papilla of the first molar is merely a slight bulging at the seventh week, and the tenth papilla is not apparent until the eleventh week. From about the eighth week the primitive dental groove becomes contracted before and behind the first deciduous molar, and laminae of the mucous membrane are developed around the other papillae; the laminae increase in growth, and enclose the papillse in follicles with open mouths. At the tenth week the follicle of the first molar is completed, then that of the canine; during the eleventh and twelfth weeks the follicles of the incisors succeed, and at the thir- teenth week the follicle of the posterior deciduous molar. During the thirteenth week the papillae undergo an alteration of form, and assume the shape of the teeth they are intended to repre- sent. And at the same time small membranous processes are de- veloped from the mouths of the follicles; these processes are intended to serve the purpose of opercula to the follicles, and they correspond in shape with the form of the crowns of the appertaining teeth. To the follicles of the incisor teeth there are two opercula; to the canine, three; and to the molars, a number relative to the number of their tubercles, either four or five. During the fourteenth and fifteenth weeks the opercula have completely closed the follicles, so as to con- vert them into dental sacs, and at the same time the papilla have become pulps. The deep portion of the primitive dental groove, viz. that which contains the dental sacs of the deciduous teeth, being thus closed in, the remaining portion, that which is nearer the surface of the gum, is still left open, and to this Mr. Groodsir has given the title of secondary dental groove, as it serves for the development of all the permanent teeth, with the exception of the anterior molars. During the fourteenth and fifteenth weeks small lunated inflections of the mucous membrane are formed, immediately to the inner side of the closing opercula of the deciduous dental follicles, commencing behind the incisors and proceeding onwards through the rest; these are the rudiments of the follicles or cavities of reserve of the four permanent incisors, two permanent canines, and four bicuspides. As the se- condary dental groove gradi;ally closes, these follicular inflections of the mucous membrane are converted into closed cavities of reserve, which recede from the ^urface of the gum, and lie immediately to the inner side, and in close'contact with the dental sacs of the deciduous teeth, being enclosed in their submucous cellular tissue. At aboutDEVELOPMENT OF TEETH. 71 the fifth month the anterior of these cavities of reserve dilate at their distal extremities, and a fold or papilla projects into their fundus, constituting the rudiment of the germ of the permanent tooth; at the same time two small opercular folds are produced at their proximal or small extremities, and convert them into true dental sacs. During the fifth month the posterior part of the primitive dental groove behind the sac of the last deciduous tooth has remained open, and in it has developed the papilla and follicle of the first permanent molar. Upon the closure of this follicle by its opercula, the secondary dental groove upon the summit of its crown forms a large cavity of reserve, lying in contact with the dental sac on the one side and with the gum on the superficial side. At this period the deciduous teeth, and the sacs of the ten anterior per- manent teeth, increase so much in size, without a corresponding lengthening of the jaws, that the first permanent molars are gra- dually pressed backwards and upwards into the maxillary tuberosity in the upper jaw, and into the base of the coronoid process of the lower jaw; a position which they occupy at the eighth and ninth month of foetal life. In the infant of seven or eight months, the jaws have grown in length, and the first permanent molar returns to its proper position in the dental range. The cavity of reserve, which has been previously elongated by the upward movement of the first permanent molar, now dilates into the cavity which that tooth has just quitted; a papilla is developed from its fundus, the cavity becomes constricted, and the dental sac of the second molar tooth is formed, still leaving a portion of the great cavity of reserve in connection with the superficial side of the sac. As the jaws con- tinue to grow in length, the second permanent dental sac descends from its elevated position and advances forwards into the dental range, following the same curve as the first permanent molar. The remainder of the cavity of reserve, already lengthened backwards by the previous position of the second molar, again dilates for the last time, developes a papilla and sac in the same manner as the preceding, and forms the third permanent molar or \\asdom tooth, which at the age of nineteen or twenty, upon the increased growth of the jaw, follows the course of the first and second molars into the dental range. From a consideration of the foregoing phenomena, Mr. Groodsir has divided the process of dentition into three natural stages:— follicular, saccular, and eruptive. The first, or follicular stage, he makes to include all the changes which take place from the first appearance of the dental groove and papillae to the closure of their follicles;. occupying a period which extends from the sixth week to the fourth or fifth month of intra-uterine existence. The second, or saccular stage, comprises the period when the follicles are shut sacs, and the included papillae pulps; it commences at the fourth and fifth months of intra-uterine existence, and terminates, for the median incisors, at the seventh or eighth month of infantineGROWTH OP TEETH. 72 life, and for the wisdom teeth, at about the twenty-first year. The third, or eruptive stage, includes the completion of the teeth, the eruption and shedding of the temporary set, the eruption of the permanent, and the necessary changes in the alveolar processes. It extends from the seventh month to the twenty-first year. " The anterior permanent molar,''^ says Mr. Groodsir, "is the most remarkable tooth in man, as it forms a transition between the milk and the permanent set." If considered anatomically, that is, in its development from the primitive dental groove, by a papilla and follicle, "it is decidedly a milk tooth;" if physiologically, "as the most efficient grinder in the adult mouth, we must consider it a permanent tooth." "It is a curious circumstance, and one which will readily suggest itself to the surgeon, that laying out of view the wisdom teeth, which sometimes decay at an early period from other causes, the anterior molars are the permanent teeth which most frequently give way first, and in the most symmetrical manner, and at the same time, and frequently before the milk set." Growth of Teeth.—Immediately that the dental follicles have been closed by their opercula, the pulps become moulded into the form of the future teeth; and the bases of the molars are divided into two or three portions representing the future fangs. The dental sac is composed of two layers, an internal or vascular layer, which was originally a part of the mucous surface of the mouth, and a cellulo-fibrous layer, analogous to the corium of the mucous mem- brane. Upon the formation of this sac by the closure of the follicle, the mucous membrane resembles a serous membrane in being a shut sac, and may be considered as consisting of a tunica propria, which invests the pulp; and a tunica reflexa, which is adherent by its outer surface to the structures composing the jaw, and by the inner surface is free, being separated from the pulp by an interven- ing space. As soon as the moulding of the pulp has commenced, this space increases and becomes filled with a gelatinous granular substance, the enamel organ, which is adherent to the whole in- ternal surface of the tunica reflexa, but not to the tunica propria and pulp. At the same period, viz., during the fourth or fifth month, a thin lamina of ivory is formed in the pulp, and occupies its most prominent point: if the tooth be incisor or canine, the newly-formed layer has the figure of a small hollow cone ; if molar, there will be four or five small cones corresponding with the number of tubercles on its crown. These cones are united by the formation of additional layers, the pulp becomes gradually sur- rounded and diminishes in size, evolving fresh layers during its retreat into the jaws, until the entire tooth with its fangs is com- pleted, and the small cavitas pulpse of the perfect tooth alone re- mains, communicating through the opening in the apex of each fang with the dental vessels and nerves. The number of roots of a tooth appears to depend on the number of nervous filaments sent to each pulp. When the formation of the ivory has commenced, the enamel73 EKUPTION OP TEETH. -organ becomes transformed into a laminated tissue, corresponding witli the direction of the fibres of the enamel, and the crystalline substance of the enamel is secreted into its meshes by the vascular lining of the sac. The cementum appears to be formed at a later period of life, either by the production of osseous substance by that portion of the dental sac which continues to enclose the fang, and acts as its peri- osteum, or by the conyersion of that membrane itself into bone; the former supposition is the more probable. The formation of ivory commences in the first permanent molar previously to birth. Eruption.—When the crown of the tooth has been formed and coated with enamel, and the fang has grown to the bottom of its socket by the progressive lengthening of the pulp, the formation of ivory, and the adhesion of the ivory to the contiguous portion of the sac, the pressure of the socket causes the reflected portion of the sac and the edge of the tooth to approach, and the latter to pass through the gum. The sac has thereby resumed* its original folli- cular condition, and has become continuous with the mucous mem- brane of the mouth. The opened sac now begins to shorten more rapidly than the fang lengthens, and the tooth is quickly drawn up- wards by the contraction, leaving a space between the extremity of the unfinished root and the bottom of the socket, in which the growth and completion of the fang are effected. During the changes above described as taking place among the dental Sacs contained within the jaws, the septa between the sacs, at first consisting of spongy tissue, gradually became fibrous, and subsequently osseous, the bone being developed from the surface and proceeding by degrees more deeply into the jaws, to constitute the alveoli. The sacs of the ten anterior permanent teeth, at first enclosed in the submucous cellular tissue of the deciduous dental sacs, and received during growth into crypts situated behind the deciduous teeth, advanced by degrees beneath the fangs of those teeth, and became separated from them by distinct osseous alveoli. The necks of the sacs of the permanent teeth, by which they origi- nally communicated with the mucous lining of the secondary groove, still exist, in the form of cords, separated from the deciduous teeth by their alveolus, but communicating through a minute osseous canal with the mucous membrane of the mouth, immediately behind the corresponding deciduous teeth. '' These cords and foramina are not obliterated in the child," says Mr. Groodsir, '' either because the cords are to become useful as ^ gubernacula'' and the canals as ' itinera dentium/ or, much more probably, in virtue of a law, which appears to be a general one in the development of animal bodies, viz., that parts, or organs, which have once acted an im- * Mr. Nasmytli is of opinion that it is " by a process of absorption, and not of disruption, that the tooth is emancipated."—Medico-Chirurgical Trans- actions, 1839.OS HYOIDES, 74 portoMt part, however atrophied they may afterwards become, yet never altogether disappear, so long as they do not interfere with other parts or functions." Succession.'—The periods of appearance of the teeth are extremely irreg"alar; it is necessary, therefore, to have recourse to an average, which, for the temporary teeth, may be stated as follows, the teeth of the lower jaw preceding those of the upper by a short interval:— 7th month, two middle incisors. 18th month, canine. 9th month, two lateral incisors. 24th month, two last molarerf. 12th month, first molares.

OS HYOIDES. The OS hyoides forms the second arch developed from the cranium, gives support to the tongue, and attachment to numerous muscles in the neck. It is named from its resemblance to the Greek letter v, and consists of a central portion or body, of two larger cornua, which project backwards from the body; and two lesser cornua, which ascend from the angles of union between the body and the greater cornua. The body is somewhat quadrilateral, rough and convex on its antero- snperior surface, by which it gives attachment to muscles; con- cave and smooth on the postero-in- ferior surface, by which it lies in contact with the thyro-hyoidean membrane. The greater cornua are flattened from above downwards, and terminated posteriorly by a tnbercle; and the lesser cornua, conical in form, give attachment to the stylo-hyoid ligaments. In early age and in the adult, the cornua are connected with the body by cartilaginous surfaces and ligamentous fibres; in old age they become united by bone. Development.—Bjfive centres, one for the body, and one for each comu. Ossification commences in the greater cornua during the last * The 03 hyoides seen from before. 1.

The cornua were ossified to the body of the bone in the Bpecimen from which this figure was drawn.STEKNUM. 75 montli of foetal life, and in the lesser cornua and body soon after birth. Attachment of Muscles.—To eleven pairs: sterno-hyoid, thyro- hyoid, omo-hyoid, pulley of the digastricus, stylo-hyoid, mylo-hyoid, genio-hyoid, genio-hyo-glossns, hyo-glossus, lingualis, and middle constrictor of the pharynx. It also gives attachment to the stylo- hyoid, thyro-hyoid, and hyo-epiglottic ligaments, and to the thyro- hyoidean membrane. THORAX AND UPPER EXTREMITY. The bones of the thorax are the sternum and ribs; and those of the upper extremity, the clavicle, scapula, humerus, ulna and radius, bones of the carpus, metacarpus, and phalanges. Sternum.—The sternum (fig. 42) is situated in the middle line of the front of the chest, and is oblique in direction, the superior end lying within a few inches of the vertebral column, the inferior being projected forwards so as to be placed at a considerable distance from the spine. The bone is flat or slightly concave in front, and marked by five transverse lines which indicate its original subdivision into six pieces. It is convex behind, broad and thick above, flattened and pointed below, and divisible in the adult into three pieces, supe- rior, nkiddle, and inferior. The superior piece or manubrium is nearly quadrilateral; it is broad and thick above, where it presents a concave border (incisura semilunaris), and narrow at its junction with the middle piece. At each superior angle is a deep articular depression (incisura clavicu- laris) for the clavicle, and on either side two notches, for articulation with the cartilage of the first rib, and one half of that of the second. The middle piece or body, considerably longer than the superior, is broad in the middle, and somewhat narrower at each extremity. It presents at either side six articular notches, for the lower half of the second rib, the four next ribs, and the upper half of the seventh. This piece is sometimes perforated by an opening of various magni- tude, resulting from arrest of development. The inferior piece (ensiform or xiphoid cartilage) is the smallest of the three, often merely cartilaginous, and very various in appear- ance, being sometimes pointed, at other times broad and thin, and at other times, again, perforated by a round hole, or bifid. It presents a notch at each side for articulation with the lower half of the carti- lage of the seventh rib. Development.—By a variable number of centres, generally ten, namely, two for the manubrium; one (sometimes two) for the first piece of the body, two for each of the remaining pieces, and one for the ensiform cartilage. Ossification commences towards the end of the fifth month in the manubrium, the two pieces for this part beingRIBS—TRUE AND FALSE. 76 placed one above tlie other. At about the same time the centres for the first and second pieces of the body are apparent; the centres for the third piece of the body appear a few months later, and those for the fourth piece soon after birth. The osseous centre for the ensi- form cartilage is so variable in its advent, that it may exist at any period between the third and eighteenth year. The double centres for the body of the sternum are disposed side by side in pairs, and it is the irregular union of these pairs in the last three pieces of the body that gives rise to the large aperture occasionally seen in the sternum towards its lower part. Union of the pieces of the sternum commences from below and proceeds upwards; the fourth and the third unite at about puberty, the third and the second between twenty and twenty-five, the second and the first between twenty-five and thirty. The ensiform appendix becomes joined to the body of the sternum at forty or fifty-years; and the manubrium to the body only in very old age. Two small pisiform pieces have been described by Beclard and Breschet, as being situated upon and somewhat be- hind each extremity of the incisura semilunaris of the upper border of the manubrium. These pre-sternal or supra-sternal pieces, which are by no means constant, appear at about the thirty-fifth year. Beclard considers them to be the analogue of the fourchette of birds, and Breschet as the sternal ends of a pair of cervical ribs. Articulations.—With sixteen bones; viz, with the clavicles and the seven true ribs, at each side; the latter articulating by means of th.e costal cartilages. Attachment of Muscles.—To nine pairs and one single muscle, viz. to the pectoralis major, sterno-mastoid, sterno-hyoid, sterno- thyroid, triangularis sterni, aponeurosis of the obliquus externus, internus, and transversalis, rectus, and diaphragm. ' EiBS.'—The ribs are twelve in number at each side: the first seven are connected with the sternum, and are thence named sternal or true ribs; the remaining five are the asternal or false ribs; and the last two, shorter than the rest, and free at their extremities, are the floating ribs. The ribs increase in length from the first to the eighth, whence they again diminish to the twelfth; in breadth thfey diminish gradually from the first to the last, and, with the excep- tion of the last two, are broader at the anterior than at the poste- rior end. The first rib is horizontal in direction; all the rest are obKque, so that the anterior extremity falls considerably below the posterior. Each rib presents an external and internal surface, a superior and inferior border, and two extremities; it is curved to correspond with the arch of the thorax, and twisted, so that, when laid on its side, one end is tilted up, while the other rests upon the surface. The external surface is convex, and marked by the attachment of muscles; the internal is flat, and corresponds with the pleura; the superior border is rounded; and the inferior sharp and groovedRIBS TRUE AND FALSE. 77 upon its inner side, for the attachment of the intercostal muscles.* Near its vertebral extremity, the rib is suddenly bent upon itself; and opposite the bend, upon the external surface, is a rough oblique ridge, which gives attachment to a tendon of the sacro-lumbalis Fig. 42.t muscle, and is called the angle. The distance between the vertebral extremity and the angle increases gradually, from the second to the eleventh rib. Beyond the angle is a rough elevation, the tubercle; and immediately at the base and under side of the tubercle a smooth surface for articulation with the extremity of the transverse process of the corresponding vertebra. The vertebral end of the rib is some- what expanded, and termed the head, and that portion between the head and the tubercle is the neclc.

The sternal extremity is flattened, and presents an oval depression, into which the costal cartilage is received. The ribs that demand especial consideration are the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. The first is the shortest rib; it is broad and flat, and placed hori- zontally at the upper part of the thorax, the surfaces looking up- wards and downwards, m place of forwards and backwards as in the other ribs. At about the anterior third of the upper surface of the bone, and near its internal border, is a tubercle which gives attach- ment to the scalenus anticus muscle, and immediately before and behind this tubercle, a shallow oblique groove, the former for the subclavian vein, the latter for the subclavian artery. Near the pos- terior extremity of the bone is a thick and prominent tubercle, with a smooth articular surface for the transverse process of the first dorsal vertebra. There is no angle. Beyond the tubercle is a narrow constricted neck; and at the extremity a head, presenting a single articular surface. The second rib approaches in some of its charac- ters to the first. The tenth rib has a single articular surface on its head. The eleventh and twelfth have each a single articular surface on the head, no neck or tubercle, and are pointed at the free extremity. The eleventh has a slight ridge, representing the angle, and a shallow groove on the lower border; the twelfth has neither.

'-ribs forward to the anterior part of tlie chest, and contribute mainly . to the elasticity of the thorax. They are broad at their attachment to the ribs, and taper slightly towards the opposite extremity; they diminish gradually in breadth from the first to the last; in length they increase from the first to the seventh, and then decrease to the last. The cartilages of the first two ribs are horizontal in direction, the rest incline more and more upwards. In advanced age the costal cartUages are converted more or less completely into bone, this change taking place earlier in the male than in the female. The first seven cartilages articulate with the sternum; the three next, with the lower border of the cartilage immediately preceding ; the last two lie free between the abdominal muscles. All the car- tilages of the false ribs terminate by pointed extremities. Development.—The ribs are developed by three centres; one for the central part, one for the head, and one for the tubercle. The last two' have no centre for the tubercle. Ossification commences in the body somewhat before its appearance iu the vertebras; the epiphysal centres for the head and tubercle appear between sixteen and twenty, and are consolidated with the rest of the bone at twenty- five. Articulations.—Each rib articulates with two vertebrae and one costal cartUage, with the exception of the first, tenth, eleventh and twelfth, which articulate each with a single vertebra only. Attachment of Muscles.—To the ribs and their cartilages are at- tached tuienty-two pairs, and one single muscle. To the cartilages, the subclavius, stemo-thyroid, pectoralis major, internal oblique, rectus, transversalis, diaphragm, triangularis sterni, internal and external intercostals. To the ribs, the intercostal muscles, scalenus anticus, scalenus posticus, pectoralis minor, serratus magnus, obliquus extemus, obliquus internus, latissimus dorsi, quadratus lumborum, serratus posticus superior, serratus posticus inferior, sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, cervicalis ascendens, levatores cos- tarum, transversalis, and diaphragm. Clavicle.—The clavicle is a long bone, shaped like the italic letter /, and extended across the upper part of the side of the chest from the upper piece of the sternum to the point of the shoulder, where it articulates with the scapula. In position it is very slightly oblique, the sternal end being somewhat lower and more anterior than the scapular, and the curves are so disposed that at the sternal end the convexity, and at the scapular the concavity, is directed for- wards. The sternal half of the bone is rounded or irregularly quad- rilateral, and terminates in a broad articular surface. The scapular half is flattened from above downwards, and broad at its extremity, the articular surface occupying only part of its extent. The upper surface is smooth and convex, and partly subcutaneous; while the under surface is rough and depressed, for the insertion of the sub- clavius muscle. At the sternal extremity of the under surface is a80 SCAPULA, very rough prominence, which gives attachment to the rhomboid ligament; and at the other extremity a rough tubercle and ridge, Fig. 44.* for the coraco-clavicular ligament. The opening for the nutritious vessels is seen upon the under surface of th6 bone. Development.—By two centres; one for the shaft and one for the sternal extremity; the former appearing before any other bone of the skeleton, the latter between fifteen and eighteen. Articulations.—With the sternum and scapula. Attachment ofMttscles.—To six: sterno-cleido-mastoid, trapezius, pectoralis major, deltoid, subclavius, and stemo-hyoid. Scapula.—The scapula is a flat triangular bone, situated on the posterior aspect and side of the thorax, and occupying the space from the second to the seventh rib. It is divisible into an anterior and posterior surface; superior, inferior, and posterior border; anterior, superior, and inferior angle; and processes. The anterior surface, or subscapular fossa, is concave and irre- gular, and marked by several oblique ridges which have a direction upwards and outwards. The whole concavity is occupied by the sub- scapularis muscle, with the exception of a small triangular portion near the superior angle. The posterior surface, or dorsum, is convex, and unequally divided into two portions by the spine; that portion above the spine is the supra-spinous fossa; and that below, the infra- spinous fossa. The superior border is the shortest of the three; it is thin and concave, terminated at one extremity by the superior angle, and at the other by the coracoid process. At its humeral end, and formed partly by the base of the coracoid process, is the supra-scapular notch, for the transmission of the supra-scapular nerve. The inferior or axillanj border is thick, and marked by several grooves and depressions ; it terminates superiorly at the glenoid cavity, and inferiorly at the inferior angle. Immediately below the glenoid cavity is a rough ridge, which gives origin to the long head * The clavicle of the right side; its upper and anterior face. 1. The sternal end. 2.

Upon the posterior surface of this border is a depression for the teres minor; and upon its anterior surface a deeper groove for the teres major; near the in- ferior angle is a project- ing lip, which increases the surface of origin of the latter muscle. The posterior border or base, the longest of the three, is turned towards the vertebral column. It is intermediate in thickness between the superior and inferior, and convex. The anterior angle is the thickest part of the bone, and forms the A,eac? of the scapula; it is im- mediately surrounded by a constricted portion, the neck. The head presents a shallow pyriform ar- ticular surface, the gle- noid cai^ity, having the pointed extremity up- wards ; and at its apex is a rough depression, which gives attachment to the long tendon of the biceps. The superior angle is thin and pointed. The inferior angle is thick, and smooth upon the external surface for the origin of the teres major and for a large bursa over which the upper border of the latissimus dorsi muscle plays. The spine of the scapula, triangular in form, crosses the upper part of the dorsum of the bone; it commences at the posterior border by a smooth triangular surface, over which the fan-shaped tendon of the trapezius glides, and terminates at the point of the shoulder in the acromion process. At a short distance from its origin, where the triangular surface rises to the level of the spine, is a prominent tubercle, the tuberculum spincB scapulce (Retzius), which marks the * Anterior surface or venter of the scapula. 1, 1.

The upper border of the spine is rough and subcutaneous, and gives attachment by two projecting lips to the trapezius above and deltoid below; the surfaces of the spine enter into the formation of the supra and infra-spinous fossa. The nutritious foramina of the scapula are situated in the base of the spine. The acromion, somewhat triangular in form, is flattened from above downwards; it overhangs the glenoid cavity, the upper surface being rough and subcu- taneous, the lower smooth and corresponding with the shoulder-joint. Near its extremity, upon the anterior border, is an oval articular surface, for the end of the clavicle. The coracoid process IB a thick, round, and curved process of bone, arising from the upper part of the neck of the scapula, and overarching the gle- noid cavity. It is about two inches in length and very strong ; it gives at- tachment to several liga- ments and muscles. Development.-—By six centres; one for the body, one for the coracoid pro- cess, two for the acro- mion, one for the inferior angle, and one for the posterior border. The os- sific centre for the body appears in the infra-spinous fossa at about the same time as the ossification of the vertebrae; for the coracoid process during the first year; the acromion process at puberty; the inferior angle in the fifteenth year; and the posterior border at seven- teen or eighteen. Union between the coracoid process and body takes place during the fifteenth year; the bone is not complete till manhood. * A posterior view of the scapula. 1. The supra-spinous fossa. 2.

Attachment of Muscles.—To sixteen: by its anterior surface to the subscapularis; posterior surface, supra-spinatns and infra- spinatus ; superior border, omo-hyoid; posterior border, levator angnli scapulte, rhomboideus minor, rhomboideus major, and serratus magnus; anterior border, long head of the triceps, teres minor, and teres major; upper angle of the glenoid cavity, long tendon of the biceps; spine and acromion, trapezius and deltoid; coracoid process, pectoralis minor, short head of the biceps, and coraco-brachialis. The ligaments attached to the coracoid process are, coracoid, coraco- clavicular, and coraco-humeral, and the costo-coracoid membrane. Humerus.—The humerus is a long bone, and is therefore divisible into a shaft and two extremities. The superior extremity presents a rounded head; a constriction immediately around the base of the head, the neck; a greater and a lesser tuberosity. The greater tuberosity is situated most exter- nally, and is separated from the lesser by a vertical furrow, the bicipital groove, which lodges the long tendon of the biceps. , The edges of this groove below the head of the bone are raised and rough, and called the anterior and posterior bicipital ridges; the former serves for the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle, the latter for the tendon of the latissimus dorsi and teres major. The constriction of the bone below the tuberosities is the surgical neck, anji is so named, in contradistinction to the true neck, from being the seat of the accident called by surgical writers fractwre of the neck of the humerus. The shaft of the bone is prismoid at its upper part, and flattened from before backwards below. Upon the outer side, at about its middle, is a rough triangular eminence, which gives insertion to the deltoid; and immediately on each side of this eminence is a smooth depression, corresponding with the two heads of the brachialis anticns. Upon the inner side of the middle of the shaft is a ridge, for the at- tachment of the coracorbrachialis muscle; and behind, an oblique and shallow groove, which lodges the muscnlo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery. The foramen for the medullary vessels is situated upon the inner surface of the shaft of the bone a little below the coraco-brachial ridge; it is directed downwards. The loujer extremity is flattened from before backwards, and ter- minated inferiorly by a long articular surface, divided into two parts by an elevated ridge. The external portion of the articular surface is a rounded protuberance, eminentia capitata, which articulates with the cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius; the internal portion is a concave and pulley-like surface, t7^ochlea, for articulation with the ulna. Projecting beyond the articular surface on each side are the external and i^iternal condyle, the latter being considerably the longer; and running upwards from the condyles upon the borders of the-bone are the condyloid ridges, of which the external is the G 284 ULNA, most prominent. Immediately in front of the trochlea is a small depression for receiving the coronoid process of the ulna during flexion of the fore-arm; and immediately behind it a large and deep fossa, for containing the olecranon process during extension. Development.—By seven centres : one for the shaft, one for the head, one for the tuberosities, one for the eminentia capitata, one for the trochlea, and one for each condyle, the Fig. 47.* internal preceding the external. Ossification commences in the diaphysis of the humerus soon after the clavicle; in the head and tuberosities, during the second and third years of infantile life; in the eminentia capitata and trochlea during the third and sixth years; and in the condyles during the twelfth and fifteenth. The entire bone is consolidated at twenty. Articulations.—With the glenoid cavity of the scapula, and with the ulna and radius. Attachment of Muscles.—To twenty-four : by the greater tuberosity to the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, and teres minor; lesser tube- rosity, subscapularis; anterior bicipital ridge, pectoralis major; posterior bicipital ridge and groove, teres major and latissimus dorsi; shaft, external and internal head of the triceps, del- toid, coraco-brachialis, and brachialis anticus; external condyloid ridge and condyle {condylus extensorius), extensors and supinators of the fore-arm, viz., supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior, extensor carpi radialis brevior, extensor communis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, extensor carpi ulnaris, anconeus, and supinator brevis; internal condyle (condylus fexorius), flexors and one pronator, viz., pro- nator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis, pal- maris longus, flexor sublimis digitorum, and flexor carpi ulnaris. Ulna.—The ulna is a long bone, divisible into a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity is large, and forms principally the articulation of the elbow; while the lower extremity is small, and is excluded from the wrist-joint by an interarticular fibrocartilage. * The humerus of the right side; its anterior surface. 1.

The fossa for the coronoid process of the ulna.ULNA. 85 The superior extremity presents a semilunar concavity of large size, the greater sigmoid notch, for articulation with the humerus ; and upon the outer side a lesser sigmoid notch, which articulates with the head of the radius. Bounding the greater sigmoid notch posteriorly is the olecranon process; and, overhanging it in front, a pointed eminence with a rough triangular base, the coronoid pro- cess. Behind the lesser sigmoid notch, and extending downwards on the side of the olecranon, is a triangular uneven surface, for the anconeus muscle; and upon the posterior surface of the olecranon a smooth triangular surface, which is subcutaneous. The shaft is prismoid in form, and presents three surfaces, an- terior, posterior, and internal; and three borders. The anterior surface is occupied by the flexor profundus digitorum for the upper three-fourths of its extent; and below, by a depression for the pro- nator quadratus muscle. A little above its middle is the nutritious foramen, which is directed upwards. Upon the posterior surface at the upper part of the bone is the triangular uneven depression for the anconeus muscle, bounded inferiorly by an oblique ridge which runs downwards from the posterior extremity of the lesser sigmoid notch. Below the ridge the surface is marked into several grooves, for the attachment of the extensor ossis metacarpi, extensor secundi internodii, and extensor indicis muscle. The internal surface is covered in for the greater part of its extent by the flexor profundus digitorum. The anterior border is rounded, and gives origin by its lower fourth to the pronator quadratus; the_pos?;m'or is more pro- minent, and affords attachment to the flexor carpi ulnaris and ex- tensor carpi ulnaris. At its upper extremity it expands into the triangular subcutaneous surface of the olecranon. The external or radial, border is sharp and prominent, for the attachment of the interosseous membrane. The lower extremity terminates in a small rounded head, capi- tulum ulnae, from the side of which projects the styloid process. The latter presents a deep notch at its base for the attachment of the apex of the triangular interarticular cartilage, and by its point gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament. Upon the pos- terior surface of the head is a groove, for the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris ; and upon the side opposite the styloid process a smooth surface, for articulation with.the side of the radius. Development.—By three centres; one for the shaft, one for the inferior extremity, and one for the olecranon. Ossification com- mences in the ulna shortly after the humerus and radius; the two ends of the bone are cartilaginous at birth. The centre for the lower end appears at about the fifth, and that for the olecranon about the seventh year. The bone is completed at about the twentieth year. Articulations.'—^With two bones; humerus and radius; it is separated from the cuneiform bone of the carpus by the triangular interarticular cartilage. Attachment of Muscles.—To twelve: by the olecranon to the86 RADIUS. triceps extensor cuHti, one head of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and anconeus; by the coronoid process, brachialis anticus, pronator radii teres, flexor sublimis digitorum, and flexor profundus digitorum; by the shaft, flexor profundus digitorum, flexor carpi ulnaris, pronator quadratus, anconeus, extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor secundi intemodii poilicis, and extensor indicis. Fig. 48.* Eaditjs.—The radius is the rotatory bone of the fore-arm; it is divisible into a shaft and two extremities; unlike the ulna, its upper extremity is small, and merely accessory to the formation of the elbow-joint; while the lower extremity is large, and forms almost solely the joint of the wrist. The superior extremity presents a rounded head, depressed upon its upper surface into a shallow cup. Around the margin of the head is a smooth articular surface, which is broad on the inner side, where it articulates with the lesser sigmoid notch of the ulna, and narrow iu the rest of its circumference, to play in the orbicular ligament. Beneath the head is a constricted circular neck; and beneath the neck, on its internal aspect, a prominent process, the tuberosity. The surface of the tuberosity is partly smooth and partly rough; rough below, where it receives the attachment of the tendon of the biceps; and smooth above, where a bursa is interposed between the ten- don and the bone. The shaft of the bone is prismoid, and presents three surfaces. The anterior surface is somewhat concave superiorly, where it lodges the flexor longus pollicis; and flat be- low, where it supports the pronator quadratus. At about the upper thii'd of this surface is the nutritious foramen, which is directed upwards. The posterior surface is round above, where it supports the supinator brevis muscle, and marked below by several shallow oblique grooves, which aff"ord at- tachment to the extensor muscles of the thumb. The external mrface is rounded and convex, and marked by an oblique ridrje, * The two bones of the fore-arm seen from the front. 1. The shaft of the rdna. 2. The greater sigmoid notch. 3.

Upon the inner margin of the bone is a sharp and prominent crest, which gives attachment to the iater- osseous membrane. The lower extremity of the radius is broad and triangular, and provided with two articular surfaces; one at the side of the bone, which is concave to receive the rounded head of the ulna; the other at the extremity, and marked by a slight ridge into two facets, one external and triangular, corresponding with the scaphoid; the other square, with the semilunar bone. Upon the outer side of the extremity is a strong conical projection, the styloid process, which gives attachment by its base to the tendon of the supinator longus, and by its apex to the external lateral ligament of the wrist joint. The inner edge of the articular surface affords attachment to the base of the interarticular fibrocartilage of the ulna. Immediately in front of the styloid process is a groove, which lodges the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and ex- tensor primi internodii; and behind the process a broader groove, for the tendons of the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior and extensor secundi internodii; behind this is a prominent ridge, and a deep and narrow groove, for the tendon of the extensor indicis; and still farther back part of a broad groove, completed by the ulna, for the tendons of the extensor communis digitorum. Development.—By three centres; one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. Ossification commences in the shaft soon after the humerus, and before that in the ulna. The inferior centre appears during the second year, and the superior about the seventh. The bone is perfected at twenty. Articulations.—With/ow bones; humerus, ulna, scaphoid, and semilunar. Attachment of Muscles.'—To nine: by the tuberosity to the biceps; by the oblique ridge, supinator brevis, pronator radii teres, flexor sublimis digitorum, and pronator quadratus; by the anterior surface, flexor longus pollicis and pronator quadratus; by the pos- terior surface, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and extensor primi internodii; and by the styloid process, supinator longus. Carpus.—The bones of the carpus are eight in number; they are arranged in two rows. In the first row, commencing from the radial side, are, the os scaphoides, semilunare, cuneiforme, pisiforme; and in the second row, in the same order, os trapezium, trapezoides, os magnum, and unciforme. The SGAPHOii) bone is named from bearing some resemblance to the shape of a boat, being broad at one end, and narrowed like a prow at the opposite, concave on one side, and convex on the other. It is, however, more similar in form to a cashew nut flattened and concave upon one side. If carefully examined, it wiU be found to present a convex and a concave surface, a convex and a concave border, a broad end, and a narroio and pointed extremity, the tuberosity.88 CAKPUS. To ascertain to which hand the bone belongs, let the student hold it horizontally, so that the convex surface may look backwards {i. e. towards himself), and the convex border upwards: the broad ex- tremity will indicate its appropriate hand; if it be directed to the right, the bone belongs to the right; and if to the left, to the left carpus. Articulations.—"With Jive bones : by its convex surface with the radius; by its concave surface, Mg. 49.* with the os magnum and semilu- nare ; and by the extremity of its upper or dorsal border, with the trapezium and trapezoides. A ttachm en ts. —By its tuberosity to the anterior annular ligament. The SEMILUNAR boue may be known by having a crescentic con- cavity, and a somewhat crescentic outline. It presents for examina- tion four articular surfaces and two extremities; the articular surfaces are, one concave, one convex, and two lateral, one late- ral- surface being crescentic, the other nearly circular and divided generally into two facets. The extremities are, one dorsal, which is quadrilateral, flat, and indented, for the attachment of ligaments; the other^aZmar, which is convex, rounded, and of larger size. To determine to which hand it belongs, let the bone be held per- pendicularly, so that the dorsal or flat extremity look upwards, and the convex side backwards (towards the holder). The circular lateral surface will point to the side corresponding with the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—Withj^ve bones, but occasionally with only four; by its convex surface, with the radius; by its concave surface, with * A diagram showing the dorsal surface of the bones of the carpus, with their articulations.—The right hand.

This surface is divided into two parts by a ridge, when it articulates with the unciform as well as with the cuneiform bone. The CUNEIFORM bone, although somewhat wedge-shaped in form, may be best distinguished by a circular and isolated facet, which articulates with the pisiform bone. It presents for examination three surfaces, a base and an apex. One surface is very rough and irregular; the opposite forms a concave articular surface; the third is partly rough and partly smooth, and presents that circular facet which is characteristic of the bone. The base is an articular surface, and the apex rough and pointed. To distinguish its appropriate hand, let the base be directed back- wards, and the pisiform facet upwards; the concave articular surface will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With three bones, and the triangular fibrocarti- lage. By the base, with the semilunare; by the concave surface, with the unciforme; by the circular facet, with the pisiforme ; and by the superior angle of the rough surface, with the fibrocartilage. The PISIFORM bone may be recognised by its small size, and by possessing a single articular facet. If it be examined carefully, it will be observed to present four sides and two extremities ; one side is articular, the smooth facet approaching nearer the superior than the inferior extremity. The side opposite to this is rounded, and the remiaining sides are, one slightly concave, the other slightly convex. If the bone be held so that the articular facet shall look down- wards, and the extremity which overhangs the articular facet for- wards, the concave side will point to the hand to which it belongs. Articulations.—With the'cuneiform bone only. Attachments.—To tivo muscles, flexor carpi ulnaris, and abductor minimi digiti; and to the anterior annular ligament. The TRAPEZIUM (os multangulum majus) is too irregular in form to be compared to any known object; it may be distinguished by a deep groove, for the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. It is somewhat compressed, and may be divided into two surfaces which are smooth and articular, and three rough borders. One of the articular surfaces is oval, concave in one direction, and convex in the other (saddle-seat shaped); the other is marked into three facets. One of the borders presents the groove for the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, which is surmounted by a prominent tubercle for the attachment of the annular ligament; the other two borders are rough, and form the outer side of the carpus. The grooved border is narrow at one extremity and broad at the other, where it presents the groove and tubercle. If the bone be held so that the grooved border look upwards while the apex of this border be directed forwards, and the base with theCAKPUS. 90 tubercle backwards, .the concavo-convex surface will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With four bones : by the concavo-convex surface, with the metacarpal bone of the thumb; and by the three facets of the other articular surface, with the scaphoid, trapezoid, and second metacarpal bone. Attachments.—To three muscles, abductor pollicis, flexor ossis metacarpi, and flexor brevis pollicis; and by the tubercle, to the annular ligament. The TRAPEZOIDES (os multangulum minus) is a small, oblong, and quadrilateral bone, bent near its middle upon itself (bean-shaped). It presents four articular surfaces and two extremities. One of the surfaces is concavo-convex, i. e. concave in one direction, and convex in the other; another, contiguous to the preceding, is concave, so as to be almost angular in the middle, and is often marked by a small rough depression, for an interosseous ligament; the two re- maining sides are flat, and present nothing remarkable. One of the two extremities is broad and of large size, the dorsal; the other, or palmar, is small and rough. If the bone be held perpendicularly, so that the broad extremity be upwards, and the concavo-convex surface forwards, the angular concave surface will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With four bones: by the concavo-convex surface, with the second metacarpal bone; by the angular concave surface, with the OS magnum; and by the other two surfaces, with the trape- zium and scaphoid. Attachments.—To the flexor brevis pollicis muscle. The OS MAGNUM (capitatum) is the largest bone of the carpus, and is divisible into a body and head. The head is round for the greater part of its extent, but flattened on one side. The body is irregularly quadrilateral, and presents four sides and a smooth extremity. Two of the sides are rough, the one being square and flat, the dorsal; the other rounded and prominent, the palmar; the other two sides are articular, the one being concave and the other convex. The ex- tremity is a triangular articular surface, divided into three facets. If the bone be held perpendicularly, so that the articular extre- mity look upwards, and the broad dorsal surface backwards (towards the holder), the concave articular surface will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Articidations.—With seven bones : by the rounded head, with the cup formed by the scaphoid and semilunar bone; by the side of the convex surface, with the trapezoides; by the concave surface, with the unciforme; and by the extremity, with the second, third, and fourth metacarpal bones. Attachments,—To the flexor brevis pollicis muscle. The UNCIFORME is a triangiilar-shaped bone, remarkable for a long and curved process, which projects from its palmar aspect. It pre- sents five surfaces; three articular, and two. free. One of the arti-91 OS MAGNUM.—UNCIPORME, - cular surfaces is divided by a slight ridge into -two facets; the other two converge, and meet at a flattened angle.* One of the free sur- faces, the dorsal, is rough and triangular; the other, palmar, also tri- angular, but somewhat smaller, gives origin to the unciform process. If the bone be held perpendicularly, so that the articular surface with two facets look upwards, and the unciform process backwards (towards the holder), the concavity of the unciform process will point to the hand to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With_/?ve bones; by the two facets on its base, with the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones; by the two lateral articu- lating surfaces, with the magnum and cuneiforme; Und by the flat- tened angle of its apex, with the semilunare. Attachments.—To two muscles, adductor minimi digiti, and flexor brevis minimi digiti; and by the hook-shaped process to the annu- lar ligament. Development.—The bones of the carpus are each developed by a single centre; they are cartilagi- nous at jbirth. Ossification com- mences towards the end of the first year in the os magnum and unci- forme; at the end of the third year, in the cuneiforme; during the fifth year, in the trapezium and semilunare; during the eighth, in the scaphoides; ninth, in the trapezoides; and twelfth, in the pisiforme. The latter bone is the last in the skeleton to ossify; it is, in reality, a sesamoid bone of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris. The number of articulations which each bone of the carpus pre- sents with surrounding bones may be expressed in figures, which will be found to facilitate very materially the student's recollection; the number for the first row is 5531, and for the second 4475. * Wlien the unciforme does not articulate with the semilunare, this angle is sharp. t The hand viewed on its anterior or palmar aspect. 1.

They are long bones, divisible into a head, shaft, and base. The head is rounded at the extremity, and flattened at each side for the insertion of strong ligaments; the shaft is prismoid, and marked deeply on each side, for the attachment of the interossei muscles; and the hase is irregularly quadrilateral, and rough for the insertion of tendons and ligaments. The hase presents three articular surfaces: one at each side, for the adjoining metacarpal bones; and one at the extremity, for the carpus. The metacarpal bone of the thumb is one-third shorter than the rest, flattened and broad on its dorsal aspect, and convex on its palmar side; the articular surface of the head is not so round as that of the other metacarpal bones; and the base has a single con- cavo-convex surface, to articulate with the similar surface of the trapezium. The metacarpal bones of the different fingers may be distinguished by certain obvious characters. The base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger is the largest of the four, and presents four articular surfaces. That of the middle finger may be distinguished by a rounded projecting process upon the radial side of its base, and two small circular facets upon its ulnar lateral surface. The base of the metacarpal bone of the ring-finger is small and square, and has two small circular facets to correspond with those of the middle meta- carpal. The metacarpal bone of the little finger has only one lateral articular surface. Development.—By two centres; one for the shaft, and one for the digital extremity, with the exception of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, the epiphysis of which, like that of the phalanges, occupies the carpal end of the bone. Ossification of the metacarpal bones com- mences in the embryo between the tenth and twelfth week, that is, soon after the bones of the fore-arm. The epiphyses make their appearance at the end of the second, or early in the third year, and the bones are completed at twenty. Articulations.—The first with the trapezium ; second, trapezium, trapezoides, os magnum, and middle metacarpal bone; third or middle, os magnum, and adjoining metacarpal bones; fourth, os magnum, unciforme, and adjoining metacarpal bones; fifth, unci- forme, and metacarpal bone of the ring-finger. The figures resulting from the number of articulations which each metacarpal bone possesses, taken from the radial to the iilnar side, are 13121. Attachment of Muscles.—To the metacarpal bone of the thumb, three, flexor ossis metacarpi, extensor ossis metacarpi, and first dorsal-interosseous ; index finger, five, extensor carpi radialis longior, flexor carpi radialis, first and second dorsal, and first palmar inter- osseous ; middle finger, four, extensor carpi radialis brevior, adductor pollicis, second and tliird dorsal interosseous; ring-finger, three, third and fourth dorsal interosseous, and second palmar; little finger.PHALANGES.—PELVIS. 93 /owr, extensor carpi ulnaris, adductor minimi digiti, fourth dorsal and third palmar interosseous. Phalanges.—The phalanges are the bones of the fingers; they are named from their arrangement in rows, and are fourteen in number, three to each finger, and two to the thumb. In conforma- tion they are long bones, divisible into a shaft, and two extremities. The shaft is compressed from before backwards, convex on its posterior surface, and flat with raised edges in front. The metacarpal extremity or base, in the first row, is a simple concave articular surface, that in the other two rows a double concavity, separated by a slight ridge. The digital extremities of the first and second row present a pulley-like surface, concave in the middle, and convex on each side. The ungual extremity of the last phalanx is broad, rough, and expanded into a semilunar crest. Development.—By two centres; one for the shaft, and one for the base. Ossification commences first in the third phalanges, then in the first, and lastly in the second. The period of commencement corresponds with that of the metacarpal bones. The epiphyses of the first row appear during the third or fourth year, those of the second row during the fourth or fifth, and of the last during the sixth or seventh. The phalanges are perfected by the twentieth year. Articulations.—The first row, with the metacarpal bones and second row of phalanges; the second row, with the first and third; the third with the second row. Attachment of Muscles.—To the base of first phalanx of the thumb/oitr muscles, abductor poUicis, flexor brevis pollicis, adductor pollicis, and extensor primi internodii; to the second phalanx, two, flexor longus pollicis, and extensor secundi internodii. To the first phalanx of the second, third, and fourth fingers, one dorsal and one palmar interosseous; to the first phalanx of the little finger, the abductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and one palmar interosseous. To the second phalanges, the flexor sublimis and extensor communis digitorum; to the last phalanges, the flexor profundus and extensor communis digitorum. PELVIS AND LOWER EXTREMITY. The bones of the pelvis are the two ossa innominata, the sacrum, and the coccyx; and of the lower extremity, the femur, patella, tibia and fibula, tarsus, metatarsus, and phalanges. Os INNOMINATUM.—The OS innominatum (os cox«) is an irregular, fiat bone, consisting in the young subject of three parts, which meet at the acetabulum. Hence it is usually described in the adult as divisible into three portions, ilium, ischium, and pubes. The ilium is the superior, broad, and expanded portion which forms the pro- minence of the hip, and articulates with the sacrum. The ischiumILIUM. 94 is the inferior and strong part of tlie bone on which, the body rests in sitting. The os pubis is that portion which forms the front of the pelvis, and gives support to the external organs of generation. The ILIUM may be described as divisible into an internal and ex- ternal surface, a crest, and an anterior and posterior border. Mg. 51 * The internal surface is bounded above by the crest, below by a prominent line, the linea ilio-pectinea, and before and behind by the anterior and posterior border; it is concave and smooth for the ante- rior two-thirds of its extent, and lodges the iliacus muscle. The posterior third is rough, for articulation with the sacrum, and divided by a deep groove into two parts; an anterior or auricular portion, shaped like the pinna, and coated by cartilage in the fresh bone; and * The OS iimommatTim of the right side. 1.

The external surface is uneven, partly convex, and partly con- cave : it is bounded above by the crest; below by a prominent arch, which forms the upper segment of the acetabulum ; and before and behind by the anterior and posterior border. Crossing this surface in an arched direction, from the anterior extremity of the crest to a notch upon the lower part of the posterior border, is a groove, which lodges the gluteal vessels and nerve, the superior curved line; and a short distance below this, a rough ridge, the inferior curved line. The surface included between the superior curved line and the crest gives origin to the gluteus medius muscle; that between the curved lines, to the gluteus minimus; and the rough interval between the inferior curved line and the arch of the acetabulum, to one head of the rectus. The posterior sixth of this surface is rough and raised, and gives origin to part of the gluteus maximus. The crest of the ilium is arched, and curved in direction like the italic letter /, being bent inwards at its anterior termination, and out- wards at the posterior. It is broad for the attachment of three planes of muscle, which are connected with its external and internal border or lip, and with the intermediate space. On its outer lip, at about midwa^y between the anterior superior spinous process and the summit of the crest, is a prominent tubercle, tuherculum cristce ilii (Retzius), from which a strong ridge runs down to the acetabulum. This is the broadest part of the crest, and the descending ridge serves as a buttress in giving strength to the bone. The anterior border is marked by two projections, the anterior supenor spinous process, which is the anterior termination of the crest, and the anterior inferior spinous process; the two processes being separated by a notch for the attachment of the sartorius muscle. This border terminates inferiorly in the lip of the acetabulum. The posterior border also presents two projections, the posterior superior and posterior inferior spinous process, separated by a notch. In- feriorly this border is broad and arched, and forms the upper part of the great sacro-ischiatic notch. The ISCHIUM is divisible into a thick and solid portion, the body, and a thin and ascending part, the ramus; it may be considered also, for convenience of description, as presenting an external and internal surface, and three borders, posterior, inferior, and superior. The external surface is rough and uneven, for the attachment of muscles; and broad and smooth above, where it enters into the formation of the acetabulum. Below the inferior lip of the aceta- bulum is a notch, which lodges the obturator externus muscle in its passage outwards to the trochanteric fossa of the femur. The in- ternal surface is smooth, and somewhat encroached upon at its pos- terior border by the spine. The posterior border of the ischium presents towards its middle a remarkable projection, the spine. Immediately above the spine is aOS PUBIS. 96 notcli of large size, the great sacro-ischiafic, and below the spine, the lesser sacro-ischiatic notch; the former, being converted into a fora- men by the lesser sacro-ischiatic ligament, gives passage to the pyri- formis muscle, the gluteal vessels and nerve, pudic vessels and nerve, and ischiatic vessels and nerves; the lesser, completed by the great sacro-ischiatic ligament, to the obturator internus muscle, and in- ternal pudic vessels and nerve. The inferior border is thick and broad, and called the tuberosity. The surface of the tuberosity is divided into three facets; one anterior, which is rough for the origin of the semi-membranosus ; and two posterior, which are smooth and separated by a slight ridge, for the semi-tendinosus and biceps muscle. The inner margin of the tuberosity is bounded by a sharp ridge, which gives attachment to a prolongation of the great sacro-ischiatic liga- ment, and the outer margin by a prominent ridge, from which the quadratus femoris muscle arises. The suioerior border of the ischium is thin, and forms the lower circumference of the obturator foramen. The ramus of the ischium is continuous with the ramus of the pubes, and is slightly everted. The OS PUBIS is divided into a horizontal portion or body (hori- zontal ramus of Albinus), and a descending portion or ramus; it pre- sents for examination an external and internal surface, a superior and inferior border, and a symphysis. The external surface is rough, for the attachment of muscles; and prominent at its outer extremity, where it forms part of the aceta- bulum. The internal surface is smooth, and enters into the forma- tion of the cavity of the pelvis. The superior border is marked by a rough ridge, the crest; the inner termination of the crest is the angle; and the outer end, the spine or tubercle. Running outwards from the spine is a sharp ridge, the pectineal line, or linea ilio-pee- tinea, which marks the brim of the true pelvis. In front of the pec- tineal line is a smooth depression, which supports the femoral artery and vein, and a little more externally an elevated prominence, the ilio-pectineal eminence, which divides the surface for the femoral vessels from another depression which overhangs the acetabulum, and lodges the psoas and iliacus muscles. The ilio-pectineal emi- nence, moreover, marks the junction of the pubes with the ilium. The inferior border is broad, deeply grooved for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve, and sharp upon the side of the ramus, to form part of the boundary of the obturator foramen. The sym- physis is the inner extremity of the body of the bone; it is oval and rough, for the attachment of a ligamentous structure analogous to the intervertebral substance. The ramus of the pubes descends obliquely outwards, and is continuous with the ramus of the ischium. The inner border of the ramus forms with the corresponding bone the arch of the pubes, and at its inferior part is considerably everted, to afford attachment to the crus penis. The acetabulum (cavitas cotyloidea) is a deep cup-shaped cavity, situated at the point of union between the ilium, ischium, and pubes;97 ACETABULUM. OBTUKATOK FORAMEN. ,a little less than two-fifths being formed by the ilium, a little more , than two-fifths by the ischium, and the remaining fifth by the pubes. It is bounded by a deep rim or lip, which is broad and strong above, where most resistance is required, and marked in front by a deep notch, which is arched over in the fresh subject by a strong liga- ment, and transmits the nutrient vessels of the joint. At the bottom of the cup, and communicating with the notch, is a deep circular pit (fundus acetabuli), which lodges a mass of fat, and gives attachment to the broad extremity of the ligamentum teres. The obturator or thyroid foramen is a large oval interval between the ischium and pubes, bounded by a narrow rough margin, to which a ligamentous membrane is attached. The upper part of the foramen is increased in depth by the groove in the under surface of the os pubis, which lodges the obturator vessels and nerve. Develoj^r/ient.—Bj eight centres : three principal, one for the ilium, one for the ischium, and one for the pubes; and five secondary, one, the Y shaped piece for the interval between the primitive pieces in the bottom of the acetabulum, one for the crest of the ilium, one (not constant) for the anterior and inferior spinous process of the ilium, one for the tuberosity of the ischium, and one (not constant) for the angle of the os pubis. Ossification commences in the primi- tive pieces, immediately after that in the vertebrae, firstly in the ilium, then in the ischium, and lastly in the pubes; the first ossific deposits being situated near the future acetabulum. At birth, the acetabulum,' the crest of the ilium, and the ramus of the pubes and ischium, are cartilaginous. The secondary centres appear at puberty, and the entire bone is not completed until the twenty-fifth year. Articulations.—^With three bones; sacrum, opposite innomi- natum, and femur. Attachment of Muscles and Ligaments.—To thirty-three muscles : to the ilium thirteen; by the outer lip of the crest, obliquus ex- ternus for two-thirds its length, latissimus dorsi one-third, and tensor vaginse femoris its anterior fourth; by the middle of the crest, internal oblique three-fourths its length, erector spinse the remaining fourth; by the internal lip, transversalis three-fourths, and quad- ratus lumborum the posterior part of its middle third.

The true pelvis is all that portion Avhich is situated below the linea iliopectinea. This line forms the margin or hrim of the true pelvis, while the included area is called the inlet. The form of the inlet is heart-shaped, obtusely pointed in front at the symphysis pubis, expanded on each side, and encroached upon be- hind by a projection of the upper part of the sacrum, which is named the promontory. The cavity is somewhat encroached upon at each side by a smooth quadrangular plane of bone, corresponding with the internal surface of the acetabulum, and leading to the spine of the ischium. In front are two fossae around the obturator foramina, for lodging the obturator internus muscle at each side. The inferior termination of the pelvis is very irregular, and is termed the outlet. It is bounded, in front, by the convergence of the rami of the ischium and pubes, which constitute the arch of the pubes; on each side by the tuberosity of the ischium, and two irregular fissures formed by the greater and lesser sacro-ischiatic notches : and behind by the lateral borders of the sacrum, and the coccyx. The pelvis is placed obliquely with regard to the trunk of the body, the inner surface of the ossa pubis being directed upwards, and serving to support the weight of the abdominal viscera. The base of the sacrum rises nearly four inches above the level of the upper border of the symphysis pubis, and the apex of the coccyx somewhat more than half an inch above its lower border. If a line were carried through the central axis of the inlet, it would impinge by one extremity against the umbUicus, and by the other against the middle of the coccyx. The axis of the inlet is, therefore, directed downwards and backwards, while that of the outlet points dowmvdrds and fortvards, and corresponds with a line drawn from the upper part of the sacrum, through the centre of the outlet. The axis of the cavity represents a curve, corresponding very nearly with the curve of the sacrum, the extremities being indicated by the cen- tral points of the inlet and outlet. A knowledge of the direction of these axes is important to the surgeon, as indicating the line in which instruments should be used in operations upon the viscera of the pelvis, and the direction of force in the removal of calculi from the bladder; and to the accoucheur, as explaining the course taken by the foetus during parturition. There are certain characteristic differences between the male and female pelvis. In the male the bones are thicker, stronger, and more solid, the cavity being deeper and narrower. In the female the bones are lighter and more delicate, the iliac fossse large, and the ilia expanded; the inlet, outlet, and cavity are large, and the acetabula farther removed from each other; the cavity is shallow, the tuberosities widely separated, the obtui-ator foramina triangular, and the span of the pubic arch greater. The precise diameter of the inlet and outlet, and the depth of the cavity, are important con- siderations to the accoucheur. H 2PELVIS,—FEMUR. 100 The diameters of the inlet or brim are three : 1. Antero-posterior, sacro-pubic or conjugate; 2. transverse; and 3. oblique. The antero-posterior extends from the symphysis pubis to the middle of the promontory of the sacrum, and measures four inches. The transverse extends from the middle of the brim on one side to the same point on the opposite, and measures five inches. The oblique extends from the sacro-iliac symphysis on one side to the margin of the brim corresponding with the acetabulum on the opposite, and also measures five inches. The diameters of the outlet are two, antero-posterior and trans- verse. The antero-posterior diameter extends from the lower part of the symphysis pubis to the apex of the coccyx; the transverse, from the posterior part of one tuberosity to the same point on the opposite side; they both measure four inches. The cavity of the pelvis measures in depth four inches and a half, posteriorly; three inches and a half in the middle; and one and a half at the symphysis pubis. Femur.—The femui', the longest bone of the skeleton, is situated obliquely in the upper part of the lower limb, articulating by means of its head with the acetabulum, and inclining inwards as it descends, until it almost meets its fellow of the opposite side at the knee. In the female this obliquity is greater than in the male, in consequence of the greater breadth of the pelvis. The femur is divisible into a shaft, a superior, and an inferior extremity. At the superior extremity is a rounded head directed upwards and inwards, and marked just below its centre by an oval depression for the ligamentum teres. The head is supported by a neclc, which varies in length and obliquity according to sex and period of life, beiag long and oblique in the adult male, shorter and more horizontal in the female and in old age. Externally to the neck is a large process, the trochanter major, which presents on its anterior surface an oval facet, for the attachment of the tendon of the gluteus minimus muscle; and above, a double facet for the insertion of the gluteus medius. On its posterior side is a vertical ridge, the linea quadrati, for the attachment of the quadratus femoris muscle. Upon the inner side of the trochanter major is a deep pit, the trochanteric or dir/ital fossa, in which are inserted the tendons of the pyriformis, gemellus superior and inferior, and obturator externus and internus muscles. Passing downwards from the trochanter major in front of the bone is an oblique ridge, which forms the inferior boundary of the neck, the anterior intertrochanteric line; and behind, another oblique ridge, the j^osterior intertrochanteric line, which terminates in a rounded tubercle on the posterior and inner side of the bone, the trochanter minor. The shaft of the femur is convex and rounded in front, and covered with muscles; and somewhat concave and raised into a rough and prominent ridge behind, the linea aspera. The linea aspera near the upper extremity of the bone divides into three branches. The101 FEMUR. anterior brancli is continxied. forwards in front of the lesser trochanter, and is continuous with the anterior intertrochanteric line; the middle is continued directly upwards into the linea quadrati; and the pos- terior, broad and strongly marked, ascends to the base of the trochanter major. Towards ^^9- 53.* the lower extremity of the bone the linea aspera divides into two ridges, which descend to the two condyles, and enclose a trian- gular space upon which rests the popliteal artery. The internal condyloid ridge is less marked than the external, and presents a broad and shallow groove, for the passage of the femoral artery. The nutritious foramen is situated in or near the linea aspera, at about one-third from its upper extremity, and is directed obliquely from below up- wards. The lov)er extremity of the femur is broad and porous, and divided by a smooth depression in front, and by a large fossa (fossa intercondyloidea) behind, into two condyles. The external condyle is the broadest and most prominent, the internal the narrowest and longest; the difference in length de- pending on the obliquity of the femur, in consequehce of the separation of the two bones at their upper extremities by the breadth of the pelvis. The external condyle is marked upon its outer side by a promi- nent tuberosity, which gives attachment to the external lateral ligament; and imme- diately beneath this is the fossa which lodges the tendon of origin of the popliteus. By the internal surface it gives attachment to the anterior crucial ligament of the knee- joint ; and by its upper and posterior part, to the external head of the gastrocnemius and to the plantaris. The internal condyle projects upon its inner side into a tuberosity, to which is attached the internal lateral ligament; above this tube- rosity, at the extremity of the internal condyloid ridge, is a tubercle, * The right femur, seen on its anterior aspect. 1.

The outer side of the internal condyle is rough and concave, for the at- tachment of the posterior crucial ligament. Development.—By five centres; one for the shaft, one for each extremity, and one for each trochanter. The femur is the first of the long bones to show signs of ossifica- tion. In it, ossific matter is found imme- diately after the maxillse and before the ter- mination of the second month of embryonic life. The secondary deposits take place in the following order: in the condyloid ex- tremity+ during the last month of foetal life; in the head towards the end of the first year; in the greater trochanter between the third and fourth year; in the lesser trochanter between the thirteenth and fourteenth. The epiphyses and apophyses are joined to the diaphysis in the reverse order of their appearance, the junction commencing after puberty and not being completed for the condyloid epiphysis imtil after the twentieth year. Articulations.—With three bones ; os innominatum, tibia, and patella. Attachment of Muscles.—To twenty- three; by the greater trochanter, to the gluteus medius and minimus, pyriformis, gemellus superior, obturator internus, ge- mellus inferior, obturator externus, and quadratixs femoris; by the lesser trochanter, to the common tendon of the psoas and iliacus.

Patella.—The patella is a sesamoid bone, developed in the ten- don of the quadriceps extensor muscle, and usually described as a bone of the lower extremity. It is heart- shaped in figure, the broad end being ^g- 55.* directed upwards, the apex downwards; the external surface is convex, and the internal divided by a ridge into two smooth surfaces, to articulate with the condyles of the femur. The external ar- ticular surface, corresponding with the external condyle, is the larger of the two, and serves to indicate the leg to which the bone belongs. Development.—By a single centre, at about the middle of the third year. Articulations.—With the two condyles of the femur. Attachment of Muscles.—To four; rectus, crurteus, vastus inter- nus, vastus externus ; and to the ligamentum patellae. Tibia.—The tibia is the inner and larger bone of the leg; it is prismoid in form, and divisible into a shaft, an upper and lower extremity. The upper extremity, or head, is large, and expanded on each side into two tuberosities. On the upper surface the tuberosities are smooth, to articulate with the condyles of the femur; the internal articular surface being oval and oblong, to correspond with the in- ternal condyle; the external, broad and nearly circular. Between the two articular surfaces is a spinous process; and in front and be- hind the spinous process a rough depression, giving attachment to the anterior and posterior crucial ligament. Between the two tube- rosities on the front aspect of the bone is a prominent elevation, the tubercle for the insertion of the ligamentum patellse, and imme- diately above the tubercle a smooth facet, corresponding with a bursa. Upon the outer side of the external tuberosity is an articular surface, for the head of the fibula; and upon the posterior part of the internal tuberosity a depression, for the insertion of the tendon of the semi-membranosus muscle. The shaft of the tibia presents three surfaces; internal, which is * The patella of the right side. 1. The surface of articulation with the ex- ternal condyle of the femur. 2.

Near the upper extremity of the posterior surface is an oblique ridge, the popliteal line, for the attachment of the fascia of the popliteus muscle; and immediately below the oblique line, the nutritious canal, which is directed downwards. The inferior extremity of the bone is somewhat quadrilateral, and prolonged on its inner side into a large process, the in- ternal malleolus. Behind the internal malleolus, is a broad and shallow groove, for lodging the tendons of the tibialis pos- ticus and flexor longus digitorum; and farther outwards another groove, for the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. On the outer side the surface is concave and triangular, rough above for the attachment of the interosseous ligament; and smooth below, to articulate with the fibula. Upon the extremity of the bone is a triangular smooth surface, for articulating with the astragalus. Development. —'By three centres ; one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. Ossification commences in the tibia, imme- diately after the femur; the centre for the head of the bone appears soon after birth, and that for the lower extremity during the second year; the latter is the first to join the diaphysis. The bone is not complete until nearly the 25th year. Two occasional centres are sometimes found in the tibia, one for the tubercle, the other for the internal malleolus. Articulations.—^With three bones; femur, fibula, and astragalus.

Fig. 57. Fibula.—^The fibula {Trepovrj, a brooch, from its resemblance, in conjunction with the tibia, to the pin of an ancient brooch) is the outer and smaller bone of the leg; it is long and slender in figure, prismoid in shape, and, like other long bones, divisible into a shaft and two extremities. The superior extremity or head is thick and large, and depressed upon the upper part by a concave surface, which articu- lates with the external tuberosity of the tibia. Externally to this surface is a thick and rough prominence, for the attachment of the external lateral ligament of the knee-joint, terminated behind by a styloid process, for the insertion of the tendon of the biceps. The lower extremity is flattened from without inwards, and prolonged downwards beyond the articular surface of the tibia, forming the external malleolus. Its ex- ternal side presents a rough and triangular surface, \^hich is subcutaneous. On the in- ternal surface is a smooth triangular facet, to articulate with the astragalus; and a * The tibia and fibula of the right leg articu- lated and seen from behind. 1.

The anterior border is thin and sharp; the j^osterior, broad and grooved, for the tendons of the peronei muscles. To place the bone in its proper position, and ascertain to which leg it belongs, let the inferior or flattened extremity be directed downwards, and the narrow border of the malleolus forwards; the triangular subcutaneous surface will then point to the side corre- sponding with the limb of which the bone should form a part. The shaft of the fibula is prismoid, and presents three surfaces; external, internal, and posterior; and three borders. The external siwface is the broadest of the three; it commences on the anterior part of the bone above, and curves around it so as to terminate on its posterior side below. This surface is completely occupied by the two peronei muscles. The internal surface commences on the side of the superior articular surface, and terminates below, by narrow- ing to a ridge which is continuous with the anterior border of the malleolus. It is marked along its middle by the interosseous ridge, which is lost above and below in the inner border of the bone. The posterior surface is twisted like the external, it commences above on the posterior side of the bone, and terminates below on its in- ternal side; at about the middle of this surface is the nutritious foramen, which is directed downwards. The internal border commences superiorly in common with the interosseous ridge, and bifurcates inferiorly into two lines, which bound the triangular subcutaneous surface of the external, malleolus. The external border begins at the base of the styloid process of the head of the fibula, and winds around the bone, following the direc- tion of the corresponding surface. The posterior border, sharp and prominent, is lost inferiorly in the interosseous ridge. Development.—By three centres; one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. Ossification commences in the shaft soon after its appearance in the tibia; at birth the extremities are cartilaginous, an osseous deposit taking place in the inferior epiphysis during the second year, and in the superior during the fourth or fifth. The inferior epiphysis is the first to become united with the diaphysis, but the bone is not completed until nearly the twenty-fifth year. Articulations.—With the tibia and astragalus. Attachment of Muscles.—To ten; by the head, to the tendon of ' the biceps and soleus; by the shaft, its external surface, peroneus longus and brevis; internal surface, extensor longus digitorum, ex- tensor proprius pollicis, peroneus tertius, and 'tibialis posticus; by the posterior surface, popliteus and flexor longus pollicis. Tarsus.—The bones of the tarsus are seven in number: viz. astragalus, os calcis, scaphoid, internal, middle, and external cunei- form, and cuboid. The Astragalus (os tali) may be recognised by its rounded head,OS CALCIS. 107 ^ a broad articular facet upon its convex surface, and two articular facets, separated by a deep groove, on its concave surface. The bone is divisible into a superior and inferior surface, an external and internal border, and an anterior and posterior extremity. The superior surface is convex, and presents a large quadrilateral and smooth facet, somewhat broader in front than behind, to articulate with the tibia. The inferior surface is concave, and divided by a deep and rough groove (sulcus tali), which lodges a strong interos- seous ligament, into two facets, the posterior large and quadrangular, the anterior smaller and elliptic, which articulate with the os calcis. The internal border, flat and irregular, is marked by a pyriform articular surface, for the inner mal- leolus. The external presents a large triangular articular facet, for the ex- ternal malleolus, and is rough and concave in front. The anterior ex- tremity presents a rounded head, encircled by a constriction somewhat resembling a neck; and the posterior extremity is narrow, and marked by a deep groove, for the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. Hold the astragalus with the broad articular surface upwards, and round- ed head forwards; the triangular lateral particular surface will point to the side to which the bone belongs. Articulations.-—^With/owr bones : tibia, fibula, os calcis, and scaphoid. The Os CALCIS may be known by its large size and oblong figure, by the large and irregular portion which forms the heel, and by two articular surfaces, separated by a broad groove, upon its upper side. The OS calcis is divisible into four surfaces, superior, inferior, external and internal; and two extremities, anterior and posterior. The su/perior * The dorsal surface of the left foot. 1.

The inferior surface is convex and rough, and bounded posteriorly by the two inferior tuberosities, of which the internal is broad and large, and the external smaller and prominent. The external surface is convex and subcutaneous, and marked towards its anterior third by two grooves, often separated by a tubercle, for the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis. The internal surface is concave and grooved, for the tendons and vessels which pass into the sole of the foot. At the anterior extremity of this surface is a projecting pro- cess (sustentaculum tali), which supports the anterior articulating surface of the astragalus, and serves as a pulley for the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum. On the anterior extremity of the bone is a flat articular surface, surmounted by a rough projection, which aff"ords one of the guides to the surgeon in the performance of Chopart's operation. The posterior extremity is prominent and convex, and constitutes the posterior tuberosity; it is smooth for the upper half of its extent, where it corresponds with a bursa; and rough below, for the insertion of the tendo Achillis; the lower part of this surface is bounded by the twp inferior tuberosities. Articulations.-—With two bones: astragalus and cuboid. In their articulated state a large oblique canal is situated between the astra- galus and calcaneum, being formed by the apposition of the two grooves, sulcus tali and sulcus calcanei. This groove is called the sinus tarsi, and serves to lodge a strong interosseous ligament which binds the two bones together. Attachment of Muscles.—To eight: by the posterior tuberosity, to the tendo Achillis and plantaris; by the inferior tuberosities and under surface, abductor pollicis, abductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis digitorum and flexor accessorius, and plantar fascia; and by the ex- ternal surface to the extensor brevis digitorum. The Scaphoid bone may be distinguished by its boat-like figure, concave on one side, and convex with three facets upon the other. It presents for examination an anterior and posterior surface, superior and inferior border, and two extremities, one broad, the other pointed and thick. The anterior surface is convex, and divided into three facets, to articulate with the three cuneiform bones; the posterior is concave, to articulate with the rounded head of the astragalus. The superior border is convex and rough, and the inferior somewhat concave and uneven. The external extremity is broad and rough, and the internal pointed and prominent, so as to form a tuberosity. The external extremity sometimes presents a facet of articulation with the cuboid. If the bone be held so that the convex surface with three facets109 CUNEIFORM BONES. look forwards, and the convex border upwards, the broad extremity will point to the side corresponding with the foot to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With/owr bones : astragalus and three cuneiform, sometimes also with the cuboid. Attachment of Muscles.—To the tendon of the tibialis posticus. The Internal Cuneiform may be known by its irregular wedge- shape, and by being larger than the two other bones bearing the same name. It presents for examination a convex and a concave surface, a long and a short articular border, and a small and a large extremity. Place the bone so that the small extremity may look upwards and the long articular border forwards, the concave surface will point to the side corresponding with the foot to which it belongs. The convex surface is internal and free, and assists in forming the inner border of the foot; the concave is external, and in appo- sition with the middle cuneiform and second metatarsal bone; the long border articulates with the metatarsal bone of the great toe, the sJiort border with the scaphoid bone. The small extremity (edge) is sharp; the larger extremity (base) rounded into a broad tuberosity. Articidations.—With four bones; scaphoid, middle cuneiform, and first two metatarsal bones. Attachment of Muscles.—To the tibialis anticus and posticus. The liliDDLE Cuneiform is the smallest of the three; it is wedge- shaped, the broad extremity being placed upwards, and the sharp end downwards in the foot. It presents for examination four ar- ticular, surfaces and two extremities. The anterior and posterioi^ surfaces have nothing worthy of remark. One of the lateral surfaces has a long articular facet, extending its whole leng-th, for the in- ternal cuneiform; the other has only a partial articular facet for the external cuneiform bone. If the bone be held so that the square extremity look upwards, the broadest edge of the square being towards the holder, the smpJl and partial articular surface will point to the side to which the bone belongs. Articidations.—With/owbones; scaphoid, internal and external cuneiform, and second metatarsal bone. The External Cuneiform is intermediate in size between the two preceding, and placed, like the middle, with the broad end up- wards, and sharp extremity downwards. It presents for examination fiive surfaces, and a superior and inferior extremity. The upper extremity is flat, of an oblong square form, an(l bevelled posteriorly, at the expense of the outer surface, into a sharp edge.METATARSAL BONES. 110 If the bone be held so that the square extremity look upwards, and the sharp border backwards, the bevelled surface will point to the side corresponding with the foot to which the bone belongs. AHiculations.-—With six bones: scaphoid, middle cuneiform, cuboid, and second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. Attachment of Muscles.—To the flexor brevis pollicis. The Cuboid bone is irregularly cuboid in form, and marked upon its under surface by a deep groove, for the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle. It presents for examination, six surfaces, three articular, and three non-articular. The non-articular surfaces are the superior, which is slightly convex, and assists in forming the dorsum of the foot; the inferior, marked by a prominent ridge, the tuberosity, and a deep groove for the tendon of the peroneus longus; and an external, the smallest of the whole, and deeply notched by the commencement of the peroneal groove. The articular surfaces are, the posterior, which is of large size, and concavo-convex, to articulate with the os calcis; antenor, of smaller size, divided by a slight ridge into two facets, for the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones; and internal, a small oval articular facet, upon a large and quad- rangular surface, for the external cuneiform bone. If the bone be held so that the plantar surface, with the peroneal groove, look downwards, and the largest articular surface backwards, the small non-articular surface, marked by the deep notch, will point to the side corresponding with the foot to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With/ottr bones : os calcis, external cuneiform, and fourth and fifth metatarsal bones, sometimes also with the scaphoid. Attachment of Muscles.—To two: flexor brevis pollicis, and adductor pollicis. Upon a consideration of the articulations of the tarsus it will be observed, that each bone articulates with four adjoining bones, with the exception of the calcaneum which articulates with two, and the external cuneiform with six. Development.—By a single centre for each bone, with the excep- tion of the OS calcis, which has an epiphysis for its posterior tube- rosity. The centres appear in the following order; calcanean, sixth month ; astragalan, seventh month ; cuboid, tenth month; external cuneiform, during the first year; internal cuneiform, during the third year; middle cuneiform and scaphoid, during the fourth year. The epiphysis of the calcaneum appears at the ninth year and is united with the diaphysis at about the fifteenth. The Metatarsal bones, five in number, are long bones, and divisible therefore into a shaft and two extremities. The shaft is prismoid, and compressed from side to side; the posterior extremity, or base, is square-shaped, to articulate with the tarsal bones, andMETATARSAL BONES. Ill with each other; the anterior extremity presents a rounded head, cir- -enmscribed by a neck, to articulate with the first row of phalanges. - Peculiar Metatarsal hones.—The first is shorter and larger than the rest, and forms part of the inner border of the foot; its posterior extremity presents only one lateral articular surface, and an oval 59 .t rough prominence beneath, for the insertion of the tendon of the pe- roneus longus. The anterior ex- tremity has, on its plantar surface, two grooved facets, for sesamoid bones. The second is the longest and largest of the remaining metatarsal bones; it presents at its base three articular facets, for the three cunei- form bones; a large oval facet, but often no articular surface, on its inner side, to articulate with the metatarsal bone of the great toe, and two externally, for the third metatarsal bone. The third may be known by two facets on the inner side of its base, corresponding with the se- cond, and may be distinguished by its smaller size. The fourth maybe distinguished by its smaller size, and by having a single articular surface on each side of the base. The fifth is recognised by its broad base, and by the large tube- rosity on its outer side. Development. — Each bone by two centres; one for the body and one for the digital extremity in the four outer metatarsal bones; and one for the body, the other for the base in the metatarsal bone of the great toe.

Articulatians.—With the tarsal bones by one extremity, and the first row of phalanges by the other. The number of tajsal bones with which each metatarsal articulates from within outwards, is the same as between the bones of the metacarpus and carpus, one for the first, three for the second, one for the third, two for the fourth, and one for the fifth, forming the cipher 13121. Attacliment of Muscles.—To fourteen: to the first, peroneus longus and first dorsal interosseous muscle; to the second, two dorsal interossei and transversus pedis; to the third, two dorsal and one plantar interosseous, adductor pollicis and transversus pedis; to the fourth, t"n'o dorsal and one plantar interosseous, adductor pollicis and transversus pedis; to the fifth, one dorsal and one plantar in- terosseous, peroneus brevis, peroneus tertius, adductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and transversus pedis. Phalanges.—There are two phalanges in the great toe and three in the other toes, as in the hand. They are long bones, divisible into a central portion and extremities. The phalanges of the first row are convex above, concave on the under surface, and compressed from side to side. The posterior extremity has a single concave articular surface, for the head of the metatarsal bone; the anterior extremity, a pulley-Hke surface, for the second phalanx. The second ^3/<«/a?2<76's are short and diminutive, but somewhat broader than those of the first row. The third or ungual pJicdanges, including the second phalanx of the great toe, are flattened from above downwards, spread out late- rally at the base to articulate with the second row, and at the oppo- site extremity to support the nail and the rounded extremity of the toe. Development.—By two centres : one for the body and one for the metacarpal extremity. Ossification commences in these bones after that in the metatarsus, appearing firstly in the last phalanges, then in the first, and lastly in the middle row. The bones are completed at eighteen. Articvlations.—The first row with the metatarsal bones and second phalanges; the second, of the great toe, with the first pha- lanx ; of the other toes with the first and third phalanges; the third, with the second row. Attachment of Muscles.—To twenty-three : to thefrstphalanges; great toe, the innermost tendon of the extensor bre\'is digitorum, ab- ductor pollicis, adductor pollicis, flexor b^e^"is pollicis, and transversus pedis; second toe, first dorsal and first plantar interosseous and lum- bricaiis; third toe, second dorsal and second plantar interosseous and lumbricalis; fouiih toe, third dorsal and tliird plantar interosseousSESAMOID BONES. 113 and lumbricalis ; fifth toe, fourth dorsal interosseous, abductor minimi digiti, flexor brevis minimi digiti and lumbricalis. Second phalanges; great toe, extensor longus pollicis, and flexor longus poUicis; other toes, one slip of the common tendon of the extensor longus and ex- tensor brevis digitorum, and flexor brevis digitorum. Third pha- langes; two slips of the common tendon of the extensor longus and extensor brevis digitorum, and the flexor longus digitonim. Sesamoid bones.—These are small osseous masses, developed in those tendons which exert a certain degree of force upon the surface over which they glide, or where, by continued pressure and friction, the tendon would become a source of irritation to neighbouring parts, as to joints. The best example of a sesamoid bone is the patella, de- veloped in the common tendon of the quadriceps extensor, and resting against the front of the knee-joint. Besides the patella, there are four pairs of sesamoid bones included in the number of pieces which compose the skeleton, two upon the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation of each thumb, and existing in the tendons of insertion of the flexor brevis pollicis, and two upon the corresponding joint in the foot, in the tendons of the muscles inserted into the base of the first phalanx. In addition to these there is often a sesamoid bone upon the meta- carpo-phalangeal joint of the little finger; and upon the correspond- ing joint in the foot, in the tendons inserted into the base of the first phalanx; there is one also in the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle, where it glides through the groove in the cuboid bone; some- times in the tendons, as they vidnd around the inner and outer malleolus ; in the psoas and iliacus, where they glide over the body of the OS pubis : and in the external head of the gastrocnemius. The hones of the tympanum, as they belong to the apparatus of hearing, will be described with the anatomy of the ear. I114 CHAPTEE II. OF THE LIGAMENTS. The bones are variously connected witli each other in the con- struction of the skeleton, and the connexion between any two bones constitutes a joint or articulation. If the joint be immovable, the surfaces of the bones are applied in direct contact; but if motion be intended, the opposing surfaces are expanded and coated by an elastic substance named cartUage; a fluid secreted by a membrane closed on all sides lubricates their surface, and they are firmly held together by means of short bands of glistening fibres, which are called ligaments (ligare, to bind). The study of the ligaments is termed syndesmology (avv, together, Stcrfxbg, bond), which, with the anatomy of the articulations, forms the subject of the present chapter. The forms of articulation met with in the human frame may be considered under three classes: Synarthrosis, Amphi-arthrosis, and Diarthrosis. Syistarthrosis {avv, dpOpojaig, articulation) is expressive of the fixed form of joint in which the bones are immovably connected with each other. The kinds of synarthrosis are four in number. Sutitra, ^ Harmonia, Schindylesis, Gomphosis. The characters of the three first have been sufficiently explained in the preceding chapter, p. 56. It is here only necessary to state that, in the construction of sutures, the substance of the bones is not in immediate contact, but separated by a layer of membrane, which is continuous externally with the peri- cranium and internally with the dura mater. It is the latter con- nexion which gives rise to the great difficulty sometimes experienced in tearing the calvarium from the dura mater. Cruveilhier de- scribes this interposed membrane as the sutural cartilage; I never saw any structure in the sutures which could be regarded as car- tilage, and the history of the formation of the cranial bones would suggest a different explanation. The fourth, Gomphosis [yofupog, a nail), is expressive of the insfertion of one bone into another, as a nail is fixed into a board; this is illustrated in the articulation of the teeth with the alveoli of the maxillary bones. Amphi-arthrosis {d}x(pi, both, dpOpioaig) is a joint intermediate in aptitude for motion between the immovable synarthrosis and the movable diarthrosis. It is constituted by the approximation of sur- faces partly coated with cartilage lined by synovial membrane, and115 ARTICULATIONS. partly connected by interosseous ligaments, or by the intervention of -an elastic fibro-cartilage which adheres to the ends of both bones. Examples of this mode of articulation are seen in the union between the bodies of the vertebrae, the sacrum with the coccyx, the pieces of the sternum, the sacro-iliac and pubic symphysis {avv (pveiv, to grow together), and according to some, the necks of the ribs, with the transverse processes. DiARTHROSis {did, through, apOpaxrig) is the movable articulation, which constitutes by far the greater number of the joints of the body. The degree of motion in this class has given rise to a subdivision into three genera, Arthrodia, Gringlymus, and Enarthrosis. Arthrodia is the movable joint in which the extent of motion is slight and limited, as in the articulations of the clavicle, ribs, articular processes of the vertebrae, axis with the atlas, radius with the ulna, fibula with the tibia, carpal and metacarpal, tarsal and metatarsal bones. Ginglymus {yiyyXvfxdg, a hinge), or hinge-joint, is the movement of bones upon each other in two directions only, viz. forwards and backwards; but the degree of motion may be very considerable. The instances of this form of joint are numerous; they comprehend the elbow, wrist, metacarpo-phalangeal and phalangeal joints in the upper extremity; the knee, ankle, metatarso-phalangeal and pha- langeal joints in the lower extremity. The lower jaw may also be admitted into this category, as partaking more of the character of the hinge-joint than of the less movable arthrodia. The form of the ginglymoid joint is somewhat quadrilateral, each of its four sides being provided with a ligament, which is named from its position, anterior, posterior, internal, or external lateral. The lateral ligaments are thick and strong, and the chief bond of union between the bones. The anterior and posterior are thin and loose in order to permit the required extent of movement. Enarthrosis (kv, in, dpOpuxng) is the most extensive in its range ■ of motion of all the movable joints. From the manner of connection and form of the bones in this articulation, it is called the ball-and- socket joint. There are two instances in the body, viz. the hip and the shoulder, I have been in the habit of adding to the preceding the carpo- metacarpal articulation of the thumb, although not strictly a ball- and-socket joint, from the great extent of motion which it enjoys, and from the nature of the ligament connecting the bones. As far as the articular surfaces are concerned, it is rather a double than a single ball-and-socket; and the whole of these considerations remove it from the simple arthrodial and ginglymoid groups. The ball-and-socket joint has a circular form; and, in place of the four distinct ligaments of the ginglymus, is enclosed in a bag of liga- mentous membrane, called a capsular ligament. The kinds of articulation may probably be conveyed in a more satisfactory manner in the tabular form, thus : I 2116 MOVEMENTS OF JOINTS. S}Tiartlirosis. - ' Sutura . Harmonia .

The motions permitted in joints may be referred to four heads, viz. Gliding, Angular movement, Circumduction, and Rotation, 1. Gliding is the simple movement of one articular surface upon another, and exists to a greater or less extent in all the joints. In the least movable joints, as ia the carpus and tarsus, this is the only motion which is permitted. 2. Angular movement may be performed in four different direc- tions, either forwards and backwards, as in flexion and extension; or inwards and outwards, constituting adduction and abduction. Flexion and extension are illustrated in the ginglymoid joint, and er.ist in a large proportion of the joints of the body. Adduction and abduction conjoined with flexion and extension, are met with com- plete only in the most movable joints, as the shoulder, hip, and thumb. In the wrist and ankle adduction and abduction are only partial. 3, Circumduction is most strikingly exhibited in the shoulder and hip joints; it consists in the slight degree of motion which takes place between the head of a bone and its articular cavity, while the extremity of the limb is made to describe a large circle upon a plane surface. It is also seen, but in a less degree, in the carpo- metacarpal articulation of the thumb, metacarpo-phalangeal arti- culations of the fingers and toes, and in the elbow when that joint is flexed and the end of the humerus fixed, 4, Rotation is the movement of a bone upon its own axis, and is illustrated in the hip and shoulder, or better, in the rotation of the cup of the radius against the eminentia capitata of the humerus. Rotation is also observed in the movements of the atlas upon the axis, where the odontoid process serves as a pivot around which the atlas turns. The structures entering into the composition of a joint are, bone, cartilage, fibrous tissue, adipose tissue, and synovial membrane. Cartilage forms a thin coating to the articular extremities of bones, sometimes presenting a smooth surface which moves on a correspond- ing smooth surface of the articulating bone; sometimes forming a plate smooth on both surfaces and interposed between the cartilaginous ends of two bones, interarticidar; and sometimes acting as the connecting medium between bones without any free surface, inter- osseous. Fibrous tissue enters into the construction of joints under117 STRUCTURE OP CARTILAGE. the form of ligament, in one situation constituting bands of various " breadth and thickness, in another a layer which extends completely round the joint, and is then called a capsular ligament. All the ligaments of joints are composed of that variety of fibrous tissue termed white fibrous tissue, but in some situations ligaments are found which consist of yellow fibrous tissue, for example, the liga- menta subflava of the arches of the vertebral column. Adipose tissue exists in variable quantity in relation with joints, where it performs, among other offices, that of a valve or spring, which oc- cupies any vacant space that may be formed during the movements of the joint, and effectually prevents the occurrence of a vacuum in those cavities. This purpose of adipose tissue is exemplified in the cushion of fat at the bottom of the acetabulum and in the similar cushion behind the ligamentum patellae. Synovial membrane con- stitutes the smooth and polished lining of a joint, and contains the fluid termed synovia, by means of which the adapted surfaces are enabled to move upon each other with ease and freedom. Cartilage.—In the structure of joints, cartilage serves the double purpose of a connecting and separating medium. In the former ca- pacity possessing great strength; in the latter, smoothness and elasticity. In reference to structure it admits of classification into three kinds; true cartilage, reticular cartilage, and fibrous cartilage. True Cartilage is composed of a semi-transparent homogeneous substance (hyaline or vitreous substance) containing a number of minute cells (cartilage corpuscles) dispersed at short intervals through Fig. 60.* its structure. The cells are oval, oblong, or polyhedral in shape, and more or less flattened;' their membranous envelope is blended with the intercellular substance, and they contain in their interior secondary cells, nuclei, nucleoli, oil globules, and more or less * A portion of articular (true) cartilage from the head of the fibula.

Cartilage cells have an average measnrement of 15^0 (I tb. of an inch in long diameter; they are sometimes isolated, Fig. 61.* Fig. 62.t sometimes gronped in pairs, and sometimes disposed in a linear group of three or four. Near the bone they are larger than at the surface, and in the latter situation are long and slender in form, and arranged in rows having their long axis parallel with the plane of the surface. True cartilage is pearl-white or bluish and opaline in colour, its intercellular substance being semitransparent and struc- tureless. These characters, however, are changed when it exhibits a tendency to ossify; in which case the intercellular substance becomes fibrous and more or less opaque, its colour yellowish, and the cells filled with a greater number of oil-globules than in its natural state. The true cartilages are, the articular, costal, ensiform, thyroid, cricoid, aryten- oid, tracheal, bronchial, nasal, meatus auris, pully of the trochlearis muscle, and temporary cartilage, or the cartilage of bone previously to ossification. § Reticular cartilage is composed of cells (15^00^^ 0^ i^^^ ^ * Arrangement of the cells in articular cartilage.

The cells are parent cells, containing others of secondary formation, together with nuclei, nucleoli, granular matter, and oil globules, in greater number than those of true cartilage. The fibres are short, imperfect, loose in texture, and yellowish. Instances of reticular cartilage are, the pinna, epiglottis, and Eustachian tube. Fibrous cartilage is composed of a network of white, glistening fibres collected into fasciculi of various si2;e, and containing in its u Fig.G4i* meshes cells and a subfibrous tissue resembling that of reticular cartilage. The fibres of fibrous cartilage are identical with those of fibrous tissue, the cells are large (about TAirth of an inch), as in reticular cartilage, and the areolae are variable in dimensions. It is this latter character that constitutes the diffeience between difi"er- ent fibrous cartilages; some being composed almost entirely of fibres with few and small interstices, as the interarticular cartilages; while others exhibit large spaces filled with an imperfect fibrous tissue and cells, as the intervertebral substance. Fibrous cartilages admit of arrangement into four groups : inter- articular, stratiform, interosseous, and free. Instances of inter- articular fibrous cartilage (menisci) are those of the lower jaw, sternal and acromial end of the clavicle, wrist, carpus, knee, to which may be added the fibrous cartilages of circumference, glenoid, and cotyloid. The stratiform fibrous cartilages are such as form a thin coating to the grooves on bone through which tendons play. The interosseous fibrous cartilages are the intervertebral substance and symphysis pubis. The free fibrous cartilages are the tarsal cartilages of the eyelids. * A portion of fibrous cartilage. The section ia made from the symphysis pubis, and magnified 155 times.120 FIBROUS TISSUE. The development of cartilage is the same with that of cartilage of bone (p. 5), the different forms of cartilage resulting from subse- quent changes in the intercellular substance and cells. Thus in articular cartilage the cells undergo the lowest degree of development, are very disproportionate to the intercellular substance, and the latter remains permanently structureless. In reticular cartilage the cells possess a more active growth, and surpass in bulk the inter- cellular substance, while the latter is composed also of cells, which assume a fibrous disposition. In fibrous cartilage, development is most energetic in the intercellular substance; this is converted into fasciculi of fibrous tissue, while the interspaces are filled with cells and imperfect fibrous tissue in every stage of development. Fibrous Tissue is one of the most generally distributed of all the animal tissues; it is composed of fibres of extreme minuteness, and presents itself under three elementary forms; namely, white fibrous tissue, yellow fibrous tissue, and red fibrous tissue. In white fibrous tissue, the fibres are cylindrical, exceedingly minute (about 15000th of an inch in diameter), transparent and undulating; they are collected into small fasciculi (from 30^00 ^ loooo^^ of inch), and these latter form larger fasciculi, which, according to their arrangement, give rise to the production of thin lamina, membranes, ligamentous bands, and tendinous cords. The connecting medium of the fibres in the formation of the primitive fasciculi is a transparent, structureless, interfibrous substance or blastema, to which in most situations are added numerous minute dark filaments derived from nuclei, and thence termed nuclear fila- ments. The nuclear filaments are sometimes wound spirally round the fasciculi, or interlace with their separate fibres; at other times they are variously twisted, and run parallel with the fasciculi. The fasciculi are connected and held together in the formation of mem- branes and cords by loose fibres which are interwoven between them, or by mutual interlacement. Examples of white fibrous tissue are met with in three principal forms; namely, membrane, ligament, and tendon. The membranous form of white fibrous tissue is seen in the common connecting medium of the body, namely, cellular membrane, fibro-cellular, celltdar, areolar, or filamentous tissue, in which the membrane is extremely thin, and disposed in laminse, bands, or threads, leaving interstices of various size between them. It is seen also in the condensed covering of various organs, as the periosteum, perichondrium, capsulse propria of glands, membranes of the brain, sclerotic coat of the eyeball, pericardium, fasciae; sheaths of muscles, tendons, vessels, nerves, and ducts; sheaths of the erectile organs, and the corium of the dermal and mucous membrane. Ligament is the name given to those bands of various breadth and thickness which retain the articular ends of bones in contact in the construction of joints. They are glistening, inelastic, and com- posed of fasciculi of fibrous tissue ranged in a parallel direction side121 ADIPOSE TISSUE, T fey side, or in some situations interwoven with each other. The 'fasciculi are held together by separate fibres, or by cellular tissue. Tendon is the collection of parallel fasciculi of fibrous tissue, by means of which muscles are attached to bones. They are constructed on the same principle as ligaments, are usually rounded in their figure, but in some instances are spread out so as to assume a mem- branous form. In the latter state they are called aponeuroses. Yellow fibrous tissue is known also by the appellation elastic tissue, from one of its more prominent physical properties, a property which permits of its fibres being drawn out to double their length and again returning to their original dimensions. The fibres of elastic tissue are transparent, brittle, flat or polyhedral in shape, colourless when single, but yellowish in an aggregated form, and considerably thicker (50^00^^ moh. in diameter) than the fibres of white fibrous tissue. In the construction of their peculiar tissue they communicate with each other by means of short oblique fibres, which unite with adjoining fibres at acute or obtuse angles without any enlargement of the fibre with which they are joined. This circum- stance has given rise to the idea of the fibres giving off branches, an expression derived from the division of blood-vessels, and another term borrowed from the same source has been applied to their com- munication with each other, namely, inosculation; but both these expressions in their literal meaning are incorrect. When yellow fibrous tissue is cut or torn, the fibres, in consequence of their elas- ticity, become clubbed and curved at the extremity, a special cha- racter of ihis tissue. Instances of yellow fibrous tissue are: the ligamenta subflava of the arches of the vertebrse, chordae vocales, thyro-epiglottic ligament, ericothyroidean membrane, the membranous layers connecting the cartilaginous rings of the trachea and bronchial tubes, the capsula propria of the spleen, and the middle coat of arteries. It is also met with around some parts of the alimentary canal, as the oesopha- gus, cardia, and anus, around the male and female urethra, in the fascia lata, and in the corium of the skin. Red fibrous tissue is also termed contractile tissue, from a peculiar property which it possesses, and which places it physiologically in an intermediate position between white fibrous tissue and muscular fibre. Its fibres are cylindrical, transparent, reddish in hue, and collected into fascicuK. It is met with in the corium of the skin, in the dartos, around the nipple, in the excretory ducts of glands, in the coats of blood-vessels, particularly veins, in the iris, in the intervascular spaces of the erectile tissue of the penis and clitoris, around the urethra, and around the vagina. Adipose Tissue is composed of minute cells, aggregated together in clusters of various size within the areolae of common cellular tissue. The cells of adipose tissue are identical in manner of formation with other cells, being developed around nuclei, and increasing in size by the formation of fluid in their interior. In adipose cells, this fluid,122 SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE. instead of being albuminous as in otber cells, is oleaginous, the oil at first appearing in separate globules, which subsequently coalesce into a single drop. The size of adipose cells at their full develop- ment is about y^th of an inch in diameter; when isolated they are globular in form, but are hexagonal or polyhedral when compressed. They are perfectly transparent, the cell-membrane being structure- less and their nucleus disappearing as they attain their full size. Synovial Membrane is a thin membranous layer, which invests the articular cartilages of bones, and is thence reflected upon the surface of the ligaments which surround and enter into the composi- tion of a joint. It resembles the serous membranes in being a shut sac (capsula synovialis), and secretes a transparent and viscous fluid, which is named synovia. Synovia is an alkaline secretion, contain- ing albumen, which is coagulable at a boiling temperature. The continuation of this membrane over the surface of the articular car- tilage, a much agitated question, has been decided by Henle, who ascertained the existence of an epithelium on cartilage identical with that produced by the reflected portion of the membrane. In some joints the synovial membrane is pressed into the articular cavity by a cushion of fat: this mass was called by Havers the synovial gland, from an idea that it was the source of the synovia; it is found in the hip and knee joint. In the knee, moreover, the synovial mem- brane forms folds, which are improperly named ligaments, as the mucous and alar ligaments, the two latter being,an appendage to the cushion of fat. Besides the synovial membranes entering into the composition of joints, there are numerous smaller sacs of a similar kind interposed between surfaces which move upon each other so as to cause friction; they are often associated with the articulations. These are the bursce mucosce; they are shut sacs, analogous in structure to synovial membranes, and secreting a similar synovial fluid. The epithelium of synovial membranes is of the kind, termed squa- mous or tesselated; it is developed in the same manner as the epi- thelium of other free surfaces, but instead of being stratified presents only a single lamina of cells. articulations. The joints may be arranged, according to a natural division, into those of the trunk, those of the upper extremity, and those of the lower extremity. Ligaments op the Trunk.—The articulations of the trunk are divisible into ten groups, namely, 1. Of the vertebral column. 2. Of the atlas, with the occipital bone. 3. Of the axis, with the occipital bone. 4. Of the atlas, with the axis.LIGAMENTS OF THE VEKTEBEAL COLUMN. 123 5. Of the lower jaw. 6. Of the ribs, with the vertebrae. 7.

Liigamenta subflava. Capsular ligaments, Synovial membranes. Inter-spinous, Supra-spinous. Inter-transverse. Bodies.—The Anterior common ligament (fascia longitudinalis anterior) is a broad and riband-like band of ligamentous fibres, ex- tending along the front surface of the vertebrpil column, from the axis to the sacrum. It is intimately connected with the intervertebral substance, and less closely with the bodies of the ver- tebrse. In the dorsal region it is thicker than in the cervical and lum- bar, and consists of a median and two lateral portions separated from each other by a series of openings for the passage of vessels. The ligament is composed of fibres of various length closely interwoven with each other; the deeper and shorter crossing the in- tervertebral substance from one verte- bra to the next; the superficial and' longer fibres crossing three or four vertebrae. The anterior common ligament is in relation by its posterior or vertebral surface, with the intervertebral substance, bodies of the vertebrae, and with the vessels, principally veins, which separate * The anterior ligaments of the vertebrae, and ligaments of the ribs. 1.

By its anterior or visceral surface it is in relation in the neck, with the longus colli muscles, pharynx and oesophagus; in the thoracic region, with the aorta, venae azygos, and thoracic duct; and in the lumbar region, with the aorta, right renal artery, right lumbar arteries, arteria sacra media, vena cava inferior, left lumbar veins, receptaculum chyli, commencement of the thoracic duct, and tendons of the lesser muscle of the dia- phragm with the fibres of which the liga- mentous fibres interlace. The Posterior common ligament (fascia longitudinalis posterior) lies on the pos- terior surface of the bodies of the verte- brae, and extends from the axis to the sacrum. It is broad opposite the inter- vertebral substance, to which it is closely adherent; narrow and thick over the bodies of the vertebrse, from which it is separated by the veins of the base of each vertebra ; and composed like the anterior ligament of shorter and longer fibres, arranged in a similar manner. It is broader above than below, the reverse of the anterior common ligament. The posterior common ligament is in relation by its anterior sur- face with the intervertebral substance, bodies of the vertebrse, and vense basium vertebrarum; and by its posterior surface with the dura mater of the spinal cord, some loose cellular tissue and nume- rous small veins being interposed. The Intervertebral substance (ligamentum intervertebrale) is a lenticular disc of fibrous cartilage, interposed between each of the vertebrse from the axis to the sacrum, and retaining them firmly in connexion with each other. It differs in thickness in different parts of the column, and varies in depth at different points of its extent; thus, it is thickest in the lumbar region, deepest in front in the cer- vical and lumbar regions, and behind in the dorsal region; and con- tributes to the formation of the natural curves of the vertebral column. The aggregate length of tl;e intervertebral substance has been estimated at one-fourth of that of the vertebral column, ex- cluding the sacrum and coccyx. * A posterior view of the bodies of three dorsal vertebrse, connected by their intervertebral substance 1, 1.

The central part of each intervertebral disc is wholly made up of this softer fibrous cartilage, which has the appearance of a pulp, and is so elastic as to rise above the level of the section as soon as its division is completed. When examined from the front, the layers are found to consist of fibres passing obliquely between the two ver- tebrae, in one layer passing from left to right, in the next from right to left, alternating in each successive layer. Arches.—The ligamenta subflava are two thin planes of yellow fibrous tissue, situated between the arches of each pair of vertebrae, from the axis to the sacrum. From the imbricated position of the laminae they are attached to the posterior surface of the vertebra below, and the an- terior surface of the arch of the vertebra above, being sepa- rated from each other at the middle line by a slight inter- space. They counteract, by their elasticity, the efforts of the flexor miiscles of the trunk; and by preserving the upright position' of the spine, limit the expenditure of muscular force. They are longest in the cervical and thickest in the lumbar region. The ligamenta subflava are in relation by both surfaces with the meningo-rachidian veins, and internally they are separated from the dura mater of the spinal cord by those veins and some loose cellular and adipose tissue. Articular processes.—The ligaments of the articular processes of the vertebrae (ligamenta processuum obliquorum) are thin layers of ligamentous fibres which surround and enclose tie synovial mem- branes; the latter being looser in the cervical than in the other regions of the spine. Spinous processes. — The interspinms ligaments (membrana interspinalis), thin and membranous, are extended between the spinous processes in the dorsal and lumbar regions. They are thickest in the latter; and are ia relation with the multifidus spinae muscle at each side. * An internal view of tlie aretes of three vertebrae. To obtain this view the laminse have been divided through their pedicles. 1. One of the liga- menta subflava. 2. The capsular ligament of one side.126 LIGAMENTS OP THE VEETEBRAL COLUMN. The Supraspinous ligament (ligamenta apicum, fig. 75) is a strong, fibrous cord, extending from the apex of the spinous process of the last cervical vertebra to the sacrum, and attached to each spinous process in its course. Like the anterior and posterior com- mon ligaments, it is composed of fibres of unequal length, the deeper fibres passing from one vertebra to the next, the superficial fibres extending over several spinous processes. It is thickest in the lum- bar region. The continuation of this ligament upwards to the tuberosity of the occipital bone, constitutes the rudimentary liga- mentum nuch^ of man. The latter is strengthened, as in animals, by a thin slip from the spinous process of each cervical vertebra. Transverse processes.—The intertransverse ligaments are thin and membranous ; they are found only between the transverse pro- cesses of the lower dorsal vertebrse. 2. Articulation of the Atlas vnth the Occipital hone.—The liga- ments of this articulation are seven in number : Two anterior occipito-atloid, Posterior occipito-atloid, Lateral occipito-atloid.

It is attached above ,' to the basilar process of the occipital bone; and below, to the an- terior tubercle of the atlas. The deeper ligament is a broad mem- branous layer, attached above to the margin of the occipital foramen, between the two condyles ; and below, to the whole length of the anterior arch of the atlas. It is in relation in front with the recti antici minores, and behind with the odontoid ligaments. The posterior ligament is thin and membranous ; attached above to the margin of the occipital foramen, between the two condyles; Fig. 69.* and below, to the posterior arch of the atlas. It is closely adherent to the dtira mater, by its inner surface ; and forms a ligamentous arch at each side, for the passage of the vertebral artery and first cervical nerve. It is in relation posteriorly with the recti postici minores and obliqui superiores. The lateral ligaments are strong fasciculi of ligamentous fibres, attached below to the base of the transverse process of the atlas at each side ; and above, to the transverse process of the occipital bone. With a ligamentous expansion derived from the vaginal process of the temporal bone, these ligaments form a strong sheath around the vessels and nerves which pass through the carotid and jugular foramina. The capsular ligaments (condylo-atloidea) are the thin and loose ligamentous capsules which surround the synovial membranes of the articulations between the condyles of the occipital bone and the superior articular processes of the atlas. The ligamentous fibres are most numerous upon the anterior and external part of the articu- lation. * The posterior ligaments of the occipito-atloid, and atlo-asoid articula- tions. 1. The atlas. 2.

The movements taking place between the cranium and atlas, are those of flexion and erection, giving rise to the forward nodding of the head. When this motion is increased to any extent, the whole of the cervical region concurs in its production. 3. Articulation of the Axis with the Occipital hone.—The liga- ments of this articulation are three in number, Occipito-axoid^ Two odontoid. The occipito-axoid ligament (apparatus ligamentosus colli) is a broad band, which covers in the odontoid process and its ligaments. It is attached below to the body of the axis, where it is continuous with the posterior common ligament; superiorly it is inserted by a Mg. 70* broad expansion, into the basilar groove of the occipital bone. It is firmly connected opposite the body of the axis, with the dura mater ; and is sometimes described as consisting of a central and two lateral portions. The odontoid ligaments (alaria) are two short and thick fasciculi of fibres, which pass outwards from the apex of the odontoid process, to the sides of the occipital foramen and condyles. A third and smaller fasciculus (ligamentum dentis suspensorium) proceeds from the apex of the odontoid process to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. These ligaments serve to limit the extent to which rotation of the head may be carried, hence they are termed check ligaments. * The upper part of the vertebral canal, opened from behind in order to show the occipito-axoid ligament. 1.

Articulation of the Atlas with the Axis.—The ligaments of this articulation are five in number,— Anterior atlo-axoid, Two capsular, Posterior atlo-axoid, Transverse. The anterior ligament consists of ligamentous fibres, which pass from the anterior tubercle and arch of the atlas to the base of the odontoid process and body of the axis, where they are continuous with the commencement of the anterior common ligament. The posterior ligament is a thin and membranous layer, passing between the posterior arch of the atlas and the laminge of the axis. The capsular ligaments surround the articular processes of the atlas and axis; they are loose, to permit of the freedom of move- Fig. 71* ment which subsists between these vertebrae. The ligamentous fibres are most numerous on the outer and anterior part of the articulation, and the synovial membrane usually communicates with the synovial cavity situated between the transverse ligament and the odontoid process. The transverse ligament is a strong ligamentous band, which arches across the area of the ring of the atlas from a rough tubercle on the inner surface of one articular process to a corresponding tu- bercle on the other. It serves to retain the odontoid process of the axis, in connexion with the anterior arch of the atlas.

A synovial membrane is situated between the transverse ligament and odontoid process; and another between that process and the anterior arch of the atlas. Actions.—It is the peculiar disposition of the transverse ligament in relation to the odontoid process, that enables the atlas, and with it the entire cranium, to rotate upon the axis; the perfect freedom of movement between these bones being ensured by the two synovial membranes. The lower part of the ring, formed by the transverse ligament with the atlas, is smaller than the upper, while the summit of the odontoid process is larger than its base; so that the process is retained in position by the transverse ligament, when the other ligaments are cut through. The extent to which rotation of the head upon the axis can be carried, is determined by the odontoid or check ligaments. The odontoid process with its ligaments is covered in by the occipito-axoid ligament. 5. Articulation of tlie Lower Jaw.—The lower jaw has properly but one ligament, the external lateral; the ligaments usually de- scribed are three in number; to which may be added, as appertain- ing to the mechanism of the joint, an interarticular fibrous-cartilage, and two synovial membranes, thus :— External lateral, Interarticular fibrous cartilage, Internal lateral.

It is in relation with, externally, the integument of the face; internally, the two synovial membranes of the articulation and the interarticular cartilage. The external lateral ligament acts conjointly with its fellow of the oppo- site side of the head in the movements of the jaw. The internal lateral ligament (spheno-maxillary) has no connexion with the articulation of the lower jaw, and is incorrectly named in relation to that joint; it is a thin aponeurotic expansion extend- ing from the extremity of the spinous process of the sphenoid bone to the margin of the dental foramen; and is pierced at its insertion by the mylo-hyoidean nerve. A triangular space is left between the internal lateral ligament and neck of the jaw, in which are situated the internal maxillary artery, auriculo-temporal nerve, inferior dental artery and nerve, and part of the external pterygoid muscle; internally it is in rela- tion with the internal pterygoid muscle. The capsular ligament (membrana maxillae articularis) consists of numerous irregular ligamentous fibres, which pass from the edge of the glenoid cavity to the neck of the lower jaw, and surround the articulation; on the inner side of ; the joint they form a pretty strong fasciculus. The interarticular fibrous cartilage (cartilage intermedia) is a thin oval plate, thicker at the edges than in the centre, and placed horizontally between the head of the condyle of the lower jaw and the glenoid cavity. It is connected by its outer border with the external lateral liga- ment, and in front receives some fibres of insertion of the external pterygoid muscle. It divides the joint into two distinct cavities, the one being above, the other below the cartilage; but is occasion- ally incomplete in the centre. The synovial membranes are situated, one above, the other below the fibrous cartilage, the former being the larger of the two. When * Internal view of the articulation of the lower jaw. 1.

Besides the lower jaw, there are several other joints provided with a complete interarticular cartilage, and, consequently, with two synovial membranes; they are, the sterno-clavicular, acromio- clavicular, and the articidation of the ulna with the cimeiform hone. The interarticular fibrous-cartilages of the knee-joint are partial, and there is but one synovial membrane. The articulations of the heads of the ribs with the vertebrae have two synovial membranes separated by an interarticular ligament without fibrous-cartilage. Connected with the lower jaw, though not with the joint, is the stylo-maxillary ligament, a process of the deep cervical fascia ex- tended between the point of the styloid process and the angle of the jaw. It is attached to the jaw between the insertions of the mas- seter and internal pterygoid muscle, and separates the parotid from the submaxillary gland. Actions.—The movements of the lower jaw are depression, by which the mouth is opened, elevation, by which it is closed; a for- ward and backward movement, and a movement from side to side. In the movement of depression the interarticular cartilage glides forward on the eminentia articularis, carrying with it the condyle. If this movement be carried too far, the superior synovial membrane * In this sketch a section has been made through the joint, to show the position of the interarticular fibro-cartilage, and the manner of its adaptation to the articulating surfaces. 1.

In elevation the fibrous cartilage and condyle are returned to their original position. The forward and backward movement is a gliding of the fibro-cartilage upon the glenoid articular surface, in the antero-posterior direction; and the movement from side to side, in the lateral direction. 6. Articulation of the Ribs with the Vertebra;.—The ligaments of these articulations are so strong as to render dislocation impossible; the neck of the rib would break before displacement could occur: they are divisible into two groups :- -1. Those connecting the head of the rib with the bodies of the vertebra^; and, 2. Those connecting the necJc and tubercle of the rib with the transverse processes. They are, 1st Group. 2nd Group. Anterior costo-vertebral or stellate, Anterior costo-transverse, Capsular, Middle costo-transverse, Interarticular ligament. Posterior costo-transverse. Two synovial membranes. The anterior costo-vertebral or stellate ligament (lig. capituli cos- tarum, fig. 65) consists of three short bands of ligamentous fibres that radiate from the anterior part of the head of the rib. The superior band passes upwards to be attached to the vertebra above; the middle fasciculus is attached to the intervertebral substance; and the inferior, to the vertebra below. In the first, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, the three fasciculi are attached to the body of the corresponding vertebra. The capsular ligament is a thin layer of ligamentous fibres sur- rounding the joint in the interval left by the anterior ligament; it is thickest above and below the articulation, and protects the synovial membranes. The interarticidar ligament is a thin band which passes between the sharp crest on the head of the rib and the intervertebral sub- stance. It divides the joint into two cavities, which are each fur- nished with a separate synovial membrane. The first, eleventh, and twelfth ribs have no interarticular ligament, and consequently but one synovial membrane. The anterior costo-transverse ligament (lig. transversarium in- ternum) is a broad band composed of two fasciculi, which ascend from the crest-like ridge on the neck of the rib, to the transverse process immediately above. This ligament separates the anterior from the dorsal branch of the intercostal nerve. The middle costo-transverse ligament (lig. cervicis externum) is a very strong interosseous ligament passing directly between the posterior surface of the neck of the rib, and the transverse process against which it rests. It is absent in the first and two inferior ribs. The posterior costo-transverse ligament (lig. transversarium ex-LIGAMENTS OF THE RIBS. 134 terirnm) is a small but strong fasciculus, passing obliquely from tbe tubercle of the rib to the apex of the transverse process. The ar- ticulation between the tubercle of the rib and the transverse process is provided with a small synovial membrane. There is no anterior costo- transverse ligament to the first or last rib; and only rudi- mentary posterior costo-trans- verse ligaments to the eleventh and twelfth ribs. Several acces- sory bands [ligamenta acces- soria) are found passing be- tween the transverse processes and the ribs ; a broad band of this kind connects the last rib with the trans verse process of the first or second lumbar vertebra. A ctions. — The movements permitted by the articulations of the ribs are ujnvards, down- wards, and slightly forioards and backwards; the move- ment increasing in extent from the head to the extremity of the rib. The forward and backward movement is very trifling in the seven superior, but greater in the inferior ribs; the eleventh and twelfth are very movable. 7. Articulation of the Ribs with the Sternum, and with each other.—The ligaments of the costo-sternal articulations are— Anterior costo-sternal, Posterior costo-sternal, Superior costo-sternal, Inferior costo-sternal, Synovial membranes. The anterior costo-sternal ligament (lig. costo-stemale radiatum) is a thin band of ligamentous fibres, passing in a radiated direction from the extremity of the costal cartilage to the anterior surface of the sternum, and intermingling its fibres with those of the ligament of the opposite side, and with the tendinous fibres of origin of the pectoralis major muscle. The posterior costo-sternal ligament, much smaller than the an- terior, consists of a thin fasciculus of fibres, situated on the pos- terior surface of the articulation. The superior and inferior costo-sternal ligaments are narrow * A posterior view of a part of the thoracic portion of the vertebral cohunn, showing the hgaments connecting the vertebrae with each other and the ribs with the vertebrae. 1, 1.

The synovial membrane is absent in the articulation of the first rib, its cartilage being usually continuous with the sternum ; that of the second rib has an interarticular ligament, with two synovial membranes. The sixth and seventh ribs have several fasciculi of strong liga- mentous fibres, passing from the extremity of their cartilages to the anterior surface of the ensiform cartilage, which latter they are in- tended to support. They are named the costo-xyphoid ligaments. The sixth, seventh, and eighth, and sometimes the fifth and the ninth costal cartilages, have articulations with each other, and a perfect synovial membrane at each articulation. They are connected by ligamentous fibres (ligamenta corr%iscantia), which pass from one cartilage to the other, external and internal ligaments. The ninth and tenth are connected at their extremities by liga- mentous fibres, but have no synovial membranes. Actions.—The movements of the costo-sternal articulations are very trifling, being limited to a slight degree of sliding motion. The first rib is the least, the second the most movable. 8. Articulation of the Stermim.—The pieces of the sternum are connected by means of a thin plate of interosseous cartilage placed between each, and by an anterior and posterior ligament (membrana ossium sterni). The fibres of the anterior sternxil ligament are longitudinal in direction, but so blended with the anterior costo- sternal ligaments and tendinous fibres of origin of the pectoral muscles, as scarcely to be distinguished as a distinct ligament. The posterior sternal ligament is a broad smooth plane of longitudinal fibres, placed on the posterior surface of the bone, and extending from the manubrium to the ensiform cartilage. These ligaments contribute very materially to the strength of the sternum and elas- ticity of the front of the chest; their continuation downwards on the ensiform cartilage constitutes the sterno-xyphoid ligaments. 9. Articulation of the Vertebral Column toith the Pelvis.—The last lumbar vertebra is connected with the sacrum by the same ligaments with which the various vertebrae are connected to each other ; vi^;., anterior and posterior common ligament, intervertebral substance, ligamenta subflava, capsular ligaments, inter and supra- spinous ligament. There are, however, t^oo proper ligaments connecting the vertebral column with the pelvis ; these are, the Lumbo-sacral, Lumbo-iliac. The lumbosacral or sacro-vertebral ligament is sl thick triangular fasciculus of ligamentous fibres, connected above with the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra, and below with the posterior part of the upper border of the sacrum.136 LIGAMENTS OP THE PELVIS. The lumbo-iliac or ilio-lumhar ligament passes from the apex of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra to that part of the crest of the ilium which surmounts the sacro-iliac articulation. It is triangular in form. Fig. 76.* 10. Articulations of the Pelvis.—The ligaments belonging to the articulations of the pelvis are divisible into four groups :—1, those connecting the sacrum and ilium; 2, those passing between the sacrum and ischium; 3, between the sacrum and coccyx; and, 4, between the two pubic hones. 1st, Between the sacrum and ilium.

Anterior pubic, Posterior pubic, Superior pubic. Sub-pubic, Interosseous fibro-cartilage. 1. Betioeen the Sacrum and Ilium.—The anterior sacro-iliac ligament consists of numerous short ligamentous fibres, which pass from bone to bone on the anterior surface of the joint. The posterior sacro-iliac or interosseous ligament (ileo-sacrale breve) is composed of numerous strong fasciculi of ligamentous fibres, which pass horizontally between the rough surfaces of the posterior half of the sacro-iliac articulation, and constitute the principal bond of connexion between the sacrum and ilium. One fasciculus of this ligament, longer and larger than the rest, is distinguished, from its direction, by the name of oblique sacro-iliac ligament (ileo-sacrale longum). It is attached, by one extremity, to the posterior superior spine of the ilium; and, by the other, to the third transverse tubercle on the posterior surface of the sacrum. The surfaces of the two bones forming the sacro-iliac articulation are partly covered with cartilage, and partly rough and connected by the interosseous ligament. The anterior or auricular half is coated with cartilage, which is thicker on the sacrum than on the ilium. The surface of the cartilage is uneven, and provided with a delicate synovial membrane, which, although not demonstrable in the adult, is apparent in the young subject and in the female during pregnancy. 2. Between the Sacrum and Ischium.—The anterior or lesser sacro-ischiatic ligament (sacro-ischiadicum minus) is thin, and tri- angular in form; it is attached by its apex to the spine of the ischium; and by its broad extremity to the side of the sacrum and coccyx, interlacing its fibres with the greater sacro-ischiatic ligament. The anterior sacro-ischiatic ligament is i7i relation, in front, with the coccygeus muscle; behind, with the posterior ligament, with which its fibres are intermingled. By its upper border it forms part of the lower boundary of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, and by the lower, part of the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen. The posterior or greater sacro-ischiatic ligament (sacro-ischia- dicum majus), larger, thicker, and more posterior than the preceding, is narrower in the middle than at each extremity. It is attached, by its smaller end, to the inner margin of the tuberosity and ramus of the ischium, where it forms a falciform process, which protects the internal pudic artery, and is continuous with the obturator fascia. By its larger extremity it is inserted into the side of the coccyx, sacrum, and posterior inferior spine of the ilium. The posterior sacro-ischiatic ligament is in relation, in front, with the anterior ligament; behind, with the gluteus maximus, to138 LIGAMENTS OP THE PELVIS. some of the fibres of which it gives origin. By its superior border it forms part of the boundary of the lesser ischiatic foramen, and by its lower border, part of the boundary of the perineum. It is pierced by the coccygeal branch of the ischiatic artery. The two ligaments convert the sacro-ischiatic notches into foramina. 3. Betioeen the Sacrum and Coccyx.—The anterior sacro-coccy- gean ligament is a thin fasciculus passing from the anterior surface of the sacrum to the front of the coccyx. The 2^osterior sacro-coccygean ligament is a thick ligamentous layer, which completes the lower part of the sacral canal, and con- nects the sacrum with the coccyx posteriorly, extending as far as the apex of the latter bone. Between the two bones is a thin disk of soft fibrous cartilage. In females there is frequently a small synovial membrane. This articu- lation admits of a certain degree of movement backwards during parturition. Mg. 77* * Ligaments of tlie pelvis and hip-joint. The view is taken from the side. 1.

Bettoeen the Ossa Pubis.—The anterior puhic ligament is com- posed of ligamentous fibres, which pass obliquely across the union of the two bones from side to side, and form an interlacement in front of the symphysis. The posterior piihic ligament consists of a few irregular fibres uniting the pubic bones posteriorly. The superior puhic ligament is a thick band of fibres connecting the angles of the ossa pubis superiorly, and filling the inequalities of the surface of the bones. The sub-pubic ligament is a thick arch of fibres connecting the two bones inferiorly, and forming the upper boundary of the pubic arch. The interosseous fibro-cartilage unites the two surfaces of the pubic bones, in the same manner as the intervertebral substance connects the bodies of the vertebrse. It resembles the intervertebral substance also in being composed of oblique fibres disposed in concentric layers, which are more dense towards the surface than near the centre. It is thick in front, and thin behind. A synovial membrane is sometimes found in the posterior half of the articulation. This articulation becomes movable towards the latter term of pre- gnancy, and admits of a slight degree of separation of its surfaces. The obturator ligament (membrana obturatoria) is not a ligament of articulation, but simply a fibrous membrane stretched across the obturator foramen. It gives attachment by its surfaces to the two obturator muscles, and leaves a space in the upper part of the foramen for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve. The numerous vacuities in the walls of the pelvis, and their closure by ligamentous structures, as in the case of the sacro-ischiatic fissures and obturator foramina, serve to diminish the pressure on the soft parts during the passage of the head of the foetus through the pelvis in parturition. LIGAMENTS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The Ligaments of the upper extremity may be arranged in the order of the articulations between the different bones : they are, 1. Stemo-clavicular articulation. 2. Scapulo-clavicular articulation. 3. Ligaments of the scapula. 4. Shoulder joint. 5. Elbow joint. 6. Radio-ulnar articulation. 7. Wrist joint. ♦140 STERNO-CLAVICULAR LIGAMENTS. 8. Articulation between the carpal bones. 9. Carpo-metacarpal articulation. 10. Metacarpo-phalangeal articulation. 11. Articulation of the phalanges. 1. Sterno-clavicular Articulation.—The sterno-clavicular is an arthrodial articulation ; its ligaments are, Anterior sterno-clavicular, Posterior sterno-clavicular, Inter-clavicular, Costo-clavicular (rJiomhoid). Interarticular fibro-cartilage. Two synovial membranes. The anterior' sterno-clavicular ligament is a broad ligamentous layer, extending obliquely downwards and inwards, and covering the anterior aspect of the articulation. This ligament is in relation by its anterior surface with the integument and sternal origin of the sterno-mastoid muscle ; and behind with the interarticular fibro- cartilage and synovial membranes. The posterior sterno-clavicular ligament is a broad fasciculus, covering the posterior surface of the articulation. It is in relation by its anterior surface with the interarticiilar fibro-cartilage and synovial membranes, and behind with the sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscle. The two ligaments are continuous at the upper and lower part of the articulation, so as to form a complete capsule around the joint. The inter-clavicular ligament is a cord-like band which crosses from the extremity of one clavicle to that of the other, and is closely * Ligaments of the sterno-clavicular and costo-stei-nal articulations. 1.

SCAPULO-CLAVICULAR LIGAMENTS, 141 Connected witli the upper border of the stemum. It is separated by- cellular tissue from the sterno-thyroid muscles. The costo-clavicular ligament (rhomboides) is a thick fasciculus of fibres, connecting the sternal extremity of the clavicle with the carti- lage of the first rib. It is situated obliquely between the rib and under surface of the clavicle ; and is in relation, in front, with the tendon of origin of the subclavius muscle, and behind with the sub- clavian vein. It is the rupture of the rhomboid ligament in dislocation of the sternal end of the clavicle that gives rise to the deformity peculiar to this accident. The interarticular fihro-cartilage is nearly circular in form, and thicker at the edges than in the centre. It is attached above, to the clavicle ; below, to the cartilage of the first rib ; and throughout the rest of its circumference to the anterior and posterior stemo-clavicular ligaments. It divides the joint into two cavities, which are lined by distinct synovial membranes. This cartilage is sometimes pierced through its centre, and not unfrequently deficient, to a greater or less extent, at its lower part. Actions.—The movements of the sterno-clavicular articulation are, a gliding movement of the fibro-cartilage, with the clavicle, upon the articular surface of the sternum, in the directions, forwards, backwards, upwards, and downwards; and circumduction. This articulation is the centre of the movements of the shoulder. 2. Scap,ulo-clavicular A rticulation. —The ligaments of the scapular end of the clavicle are, the Superior acromio-clavicular, Inferior acromio-clavicular, ' Coraco-clavicular (trapezoid and conoid), Interarticular fibro-cartilage, Two synovial membranes. The stiperior acromio-clavic^ilar ligament is a moderately thick plane of fibres passing between the extremity of the clavicle and the acromion, upon the upper surface of the joint. The inferior acromio-clavicular ligament is a thin plane situated upon the under surface. These two ligaments are continuous with each other in front and behind, and form a complete capsule around the articxilation. The coraco-clavicidar ligament (trapezoides, conoides) is a thick fasciculus of ligamentous fibres, passing obliquely between the base of the coracoid process and under surface of the clavicle, and holding the end of the clavicle in firm connexion with the scapula. When seen from before, it has a quadrilateral form ; hence its name trapezoid: examined from behind, it is triangular, the base being upwards ; hence its other name, conoid. The interarticular fibro-cartilage is often indistinct, from having partial connexions with the fibrocartilaginous surfaces of the twoLIGAMENTS OF THE SCAPULA. 142 bones between which it is placed; and is not nnfrequently absent. When partial, it occupies the upper part of the articulation. The synovial membranes are delicate. There is, of course, but one, when the fibro-cartilage is incomplete. Fig. 79.* Actions.—The acromio-clavicular articulation admits of two move- ments, gliding of the surfaces on each other, and rotation of the scapula upon the extremity of the clavicle. 3. The proper ligaments of the scapula are the Coraco-acromial, Transverse. The coraco-acromial ligament (triangiilare) is a broad and thick triangular band, which forms a protecting arch over the shoulder joint. It is attached by its apex to the point of the acromion process, and by its base to the external border of the coracoid process its whole length. This ligament is in relation above with the under surface of the deltoid muscle; and below with the tendon of the supra-spinatus muscle, a bursa mucosa being usually intei-posol. * Ligaments of the scapula and shoulder joint. 1.

The transverse or coracoid ligament (supra-scapulare) is a narrow but strong fasciculus which crosses the notch in the upper border of the scapula, from the base of the coracoid process, and converts it into a foramen. The supra-scapular nerve passes through this foramen, the artery over it. 4. Shoulder Joint.—The scapulo-humeral articulation is an enar- throsis, or ball-and-socket joint; its ligaments are, the Capsular, Coraco-humeral, Glenoid. The capsular ligament completely encircles the articulating head of the scapula and head of the humerus, and is attached to the neck of each bone. It is thick above, where resistance is most required, and strengthened by the tendons of the supra-spiuatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis muscles : below it is thin and loose. The capsule is incomplete at the point of contact with the tendons, so that they obtain upon their inner surface a covering of synovial membrane. The coraco-humeral ligament is a broad band which descends obliquely outwards from the border of the coracoid process to the greater tuberosity of the humerus, and serves to strengthen the superior and anterior part of the capstdar ligament. The glenoid ligament is the prismoid band of fibrocartilage, which is attached around the margin of the glenoid cavity for the purposes of protecting its edges and deepening its cavity. It divides superiorly into two slips which are continuous with the long tendon of the biceps; hence the ligament is frequently described as being formed by the splitting of that tendon. The cavity of the articulation is traversed by the long tendon of the biceps v/hich is enclosed in a sheath of synovial membrane in its passage through the joint. The synovial membrane of the shoulder joint is extensive; it communicates anteriorly through an opening (foramen ovale) in the capsular ligament with a large bursal sac, which lines the under surface of the tendon of the subscapularis muscle. Superiorly, it frequently communicates through another opening in the capsular ligament with a bursal sac belonging to the infra-spinatus muscle; and it moreover forms a sheath around that portion of the tendon of the biceps which is included within the joint. The muscles immediately surrounding the shoulder joint are the subscapularis, supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres minor, long head of the triceps, and deltoid; the long tendon of the biceps is within the capsular ligament. Actions.—The shoulder joint is capable of every variety of motion, viz. of movement forwards and backwards, of abduction and adduc- tion, of circumduction and rotation.144 ELBOW JOINT. 5. Elbow Joint. The elbow is a ginglymoid articulation; its ligaments are/oztr in number,— Anterior, Posterior, Internal lateral, External lateral. Fig. 80.* The anterior ligament is a broad and thin membranous layer, descending from the anterior surface of the humerus, immediately above the joint, to the coronoid process of the ulna and orbicular ligament. On each side it is connected with the lateral ligaments. It is composed of fibres which pass in three different directions, vertical, transverse, and oblique, the latter being extended downwards and outwards to the orbicular ligament, into which they are attached inferiorly. This ligament is covered in by the brachialis anticus muscle. The posterior ligament is a broad and loose layer passing between the posterior surface of the humerus and the anterior sur- face of the base of the olecranon, and con- nected at each side with the lateral liga- ments. It is covered in by the tendon of the triceps. The internal lateral ligament (brachio- cubitale) is a thick triangular layer, attached above, by its apex, to the iaternal condyle of the humerus; and below, by its expanded border, to the margin of the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna, extending from the coro- noid process to the olecranon. At its in- sertion it is intermingled with some trans- verse fibres. The internal lateral ligament is in relation posteriorly with the ulnar nerve. The external lateral ligament (brachio- radiale) is a strong and narrow band, which descends from the external condyle of the humerus, to be inserted into the orbicular ligament, and into the ridge on the xilna with which the posterior part of the latter ligament is connected. This ligament is closely united with the tendon of origin of the supinator brevis muscle.

It surrounds inferiorly the head of the radius, and forms ■ an articulating sac between it and the lesser sigmoid notch. The muscles immediately surrounding, and in contact with, the elbow joint are, in front, the brachialis anticus; to i\iQ inner side, the pronator radii teres, flexor sublimis digitorum, and flexor carpi ulnaris; externally, the extensor carpi ra- dialis brevior, extensor communis digitorum, extensor carpi ulnaris, anconeus, and supi- nator brevis; and behind, the triceps.

Radio-ulnar Articulation.—The ra- dius and ulna are firmly held together by ligaments, connected with both extremities of the bones, and with the shaft; they are, the Orbicular, Oblique, Interosseous, Anterior inferior, Posterior inferior, Ijiterarticular fibro-cartilage. The orbicular ligament {annulare, coro- nale) is a firm band several lines in breadth, which surrounds the head of the radius, and is attached by each end to an extremity of the lesser sigmoid cavity. lb is strongest behind where it receives the external lateral ligament, and is lined on its inner surface by a reflection of the synovial membrane of the elbow joint. The rupture of this ligament permits of the dislocation of the head of the radius. The oblique ligament (called also ligamentum teres, in contra- distinction to the interosseous ligament) is a narrow slip of liga- mentous fibres, descending obliquely from the base of the coronoid process of the ulna to the inner side of the radius, a little below its tuberosity. The interosseous ligament (membrana interossea) is a broad and * An external view of the elbow joint. 1. The humerus. 2. The ulna. 3. The radius. 4.

It is deficient superiorly, broader in the middle than at each extremity, and per- forated at its lower part for the passage of the anterior interosseous artery. The posterior interosseous artery passes backwards between the oblique ligament and upper border of the interosseous ligament. This ligament affords an extensive surface for the attachment of muscles. The interosseous ligament is in relation, in front, with the flexor profundus digitorum, flexor longus pollicis, pronator quadratus, and anterior interosseous artery and nerve; behind, with the supinator brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor primi internodii pollicis, extensor secundi internodii pollicis, extensor indicis, and near the wrist with the anterior interosseous artery and posterior in- terosseous nerve. The anterior inferior ligament is a thin fasciculus of fibres, passing transversely between the radius and ulna. The posterior inferior ligament is also thin and loose, and has the same disposition on the posterior surface of the articulation. The inter articular, or triangular fihrocartilage, acts the part of a ligament between the lower extremities of the radius and ulna. It is attached by its apex to a depression on the inner surface of the styloid process of the ulna, and by its base to the edge of the radius. This fihrocartilage is lined upon the upper surface by a synovial membrane, which forms a duplicature between the radius and ulna, and is called the memhrana sacciformis. By its lower surface it enters into the articulation of the wrist joint. Actions.—The movements taking place between the radius and ulna are, rotation of the former upon the latter; rotation forwards being tQxmQdipronation, and rotation backwards supination. In these movements the head of the radius turns upon its own axis, within the orbicular ligament and lesser sigmoid notch of the ulna; while inferiorly the radius presents a concavity which moves upon the rounded head of the ulna. The movements of the radius are chiefly limited by the anterior and posterior inferior ligaments; hence these are not unfrequently ruptured in great muscular efforts. 7. Wrist Joint.—The wrist is a ginglymoid articulation ; the arti- cular surfaces entering into its formation being the radius and triangular fihrocartilage above, and the rounded surfaces of the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bone below; its ligaments are four in number,-— Anterior, Internal lateral, Posterior, External lateral. The anterior ligament is a broad and membranous layer consisting of three fasciculi, which pass between the lower part of the radius and the sca]3hoid, semilimar, and cuneiform bone. The 2^osterior ligament, also thin and loose, passes between theCARPAL ARTICULATIONS. 147 posterior surface of tlie radius, and the posterior surface of the semi- lunar and cuneiform bone. The internal lateral ligament extends from the styloid process of the ulna to the cuneiform and pisiform bone. The external lateral ligament is attached by one extremity to the styloid process of the radius, and by the other to the side of the sca- phoid bone, some of its fibres being prolonged to the trapezium. The radial artery rests on this ligament as it passes backwards to the first metacarpal space. The synovial membrane of the wrist joint lines the under surface of the radius and interarticular cartilage above, and the first row of bones of the carpus below. The relations of the wrist joint are the flexor and exten- sor tendons, by which it is sur- rounded, and the radial and ulnar artery. Actions.'—The, movements of the wrist joint are flexion, ex- tension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction. In these motions the articular surfaces glide upon each other. 8.

The liga- ments are, Dorsal, Interosseous fibro-cartilages, Palmar, Annular. The dorsal ligaments are ligamentous bands, that pass trans- versely and longitudinally from bone to bone, upon the dorsal surface of the carpus. The palmar ligaments are fasciculi of the same kind, but stronger than the dorsal, having the like disposition on the palmar surface. The interosseous ligaments are fibrocartilaginous lamellae situated between the adjoining bones in each range : in the upper range they close the upper part of the spaces between the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones ; in the lower range they are stronger than in the upper, and connect the os magnum on the one side to the unciforme, on the other to the trapezoides, and leave intervals through which the synovial membrane is continued to the bases of the metacarpal bones. The proper annular ligament (lig. carpi volare proprium) is a firm ligamentous band, which connects the bones of the two sides of the carpus. It is attached by one extreniity to the trapezium and scaphoid, by the other to the unciform process of the unciforme and base of the pisiform bone, and forms an arch over the anterior surface of the carpus, beneath which the tendons of the long flexors and the median nerve pass into the palm of the hand. The articulation of the ptisiform hone with the cuneiform is pro- vided with a distinct synovial membrane, which is protected by fasciculi of ligamentous fibres, forming a kind of capsule around the joint; they are inserted into the cuneiforme, unciforme, and base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. Synovial Membranes. —There oxefive synovial membranes entering into the composition of the articulations of the carpus:— The first is situated between the lower end of the ulna and the inter- articular fibrocartilage; it is called sacciform, from forming a sacculus between the ulna and radius. The second is situated between the lower surface of the radius and interarticular fibrocartilage above, and the first range of bones of the carpus belov). The third is the most extensive of the synovial membranes of the wrist; it is situated between the two rows of carpal bones, and passes between the bones of the second range, to invest the carpal extremities of the four metacarpal bones of the fingers. The fourth is the synovial membrane of the articulation of the me- tacarpal bone of the thumb with the trapezium. The fifth is situated between the pisiform and cuneiform bone. Actions.—Very little movement exists between the bones in each range, but more is permitted between the two ranges. The motions in the latter situation are those of flexion and extension.149 CARPO-METACARPAL ARTICULATIONS. Carpo-metacarpal Articulations.—The second row of bones of the carpus articulates with the metacarpal bones of the four fingers by dorsal and palmar ligaments ; and the metacarpal bone of the thumb with the trapezium by a true capsular ligament. There is also in the carpo-metacarpal articulation a thin interosseous band, which passes from the ulnar edge of the os magmim to the bases of the third and fourth metacarpal bones at their point of connexion. The dorsal ligaments are strong fasciculi which pass from the second range of carpal to the metacarpal bones ; with the exception of the little finger there are two fasciculi to each bone, namely, to the index finger, one each from the trapezium and trapezoides ; to the middle finger, one each from the trapezoides and os magnum ; to the ring finger, one each from the os magnum and unciforme ; and to the little finger, one from the unciforme. * A diagram showing the disposition of the five synovial membranes of the wrist joint. 1.

Bases of the other metacarpal bones. Fig. 83.* / \150 METACARPO-PHALANaEAL ARTICULATIONS. The palmar ligaments are thin fasciculi arranged upon the same plan on the palmar surface. The synovial membrane is a continuation of the great synovial membrane of the two rows of carpal bones. The capsular ligament of the thumb is one of the three true capsular ligaments of the skeleton; the other two being the shoulder joint and hip joint. The articulation has a proper synovial membrane. The metacarpal hones of the four fingers are firmly connected at their bases by means of dorsal and palmar ligaments, which extend transversely from one bone to the other, and by interosseous liga- ments which pass between their contiguous surfaces. Their lateral articular facets are lined by a reflection of the great synovial mem- brane of the two rows of carpal bones. A ctions. —The movements of the metacarpal on the carpal bones are restricted to a slight degree of sliding motion, with the excep- tion of the articulation of the metacarpal bone of the thumb with the trapezium. In the latter articulation, the movements are flexion, extemion, adduction, abduction, and circumduction. 10. —Metacarpo-phalangeal Articulation.—The metacarpo-pha- langeal articulation is a ginglymoid joint: its ligaments are four in number, — Anterior, Two lateral, Transverse. The anterior ligaments, thick and fibro-cartilaginous, form part of the articulating surface of the joints. They are grooved exter- nally for the lodgment of the flexor tendons, and by their internal aspect form part of the articular surface for the head of the meta- carpal bone. At each side they are continuous with the lateral ligaments. The lateral ligaments are strong narrow fasciculi, holding the bones together at each side. The transverse ligament is a strong ligamentous band passing across the heads of the metacarpal bones of the four fingers, and connected with the anterior ligaments. The expansion of the extensor tendon over the back of the fingers takes the place of a posterior ligament. A ctions. —^This articulation admits of movement in four different directions, viz., flexion, extension, adduction, and abduction, the two latter being limited to a small extent. It is also capable of cir- cumduction. 11. —Articulation of the Phalanges.—These articulations are ginglymoid joints : they are formed by three ligaments, y Anterior, Two lateral. The anterior ligament is firm and fibro-cartilaginous, and forms151 HIP JOINT. part of the articular surface for the head of the phalanges. Externally it is grooved for the reception of the flexor tendons. The lateral ligaments are very strong ; they are the principal bond of connexion between the bones. The extensor tendon takes the place and performs the office of a posterior ligament. Actions.—The movements of the phalangeal joints axe flexion and extension, these movements being more extensive between the first and second phalanges than between the second and third. In connexion with the phalanges it may be proper to examine cer- tain fibrous bands termed thecce or vaginal ligaments, which serve to retain the tendons of the flexor muscles against the flat surface of the bones. These fibrous bands are attached at each side to the lateral margins of the phalanges ; they are thick in the interspaces of the joints, thin where the tendons lie upon the joints, and are lined on their inner surface by synovial membrane. LIGAMENTS OP THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The ligaments of the lower extremity, like those of the upper, may be arranged in the order of the joints to which they belong ; these are, 1. Hip joint. 2. Knee joint. 3. Articulation between the tibia and fibula. I 4. Ankle joint. ' 5. Articulation of the tarsal bones. 6. Tarso-metatarsal articulation. 7. Metatarso-phalangeal articulation. 8. Articulation of the phalanges. 1. Hip Joint.—The articulation of the head of the femur with the acetabulum constitutes an enarthrosis, or ball-and-socket joint. The articular surfaces are the cup-shaped cavity of the acetabulum and the rounded head of the femur ; the ligaments are five in num- ber, viz. Capsular, Cotyloid, Ilio-femoral, Transverse. Teres, The capsular ligament, {memhrana capsularis, fig. 76, 8) is a strong ligamentous capsule, embracing the acetabulum superiorly, the neck of the femur below, and connecting the two bones firmly toge- ther. It is much thicker on the upper part of the joint, where more resistance is required, than upon the under part, and extends farther upon the neck of the femur on the anterior and superior than on the posterior and inferior side, being attached to the intertrochanteric line in front, to the base of the great trochanter above, and to the middle of the neck of the femur behind. The ilio-femoral ligament (fig. 76, 9) is an accessory and radi-KNEE JOINT. 152 ating band, wliicli descends obliquely from tbe anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium to the anterior intertrochanteric line, and strengthens the anterior portion of the capsular ligament. The ligamentum teres (fig. 77, 7), triangular in shape, is attached by a round apex to the depression just below the middle of the head of the femur, and by its base, which divides into two fasciculi, into the borders of the notch of the acetabulxun. It is formed by a fasci- culus of fibres of variable size, surrounded by synovial membrane ; sometimes the synovial membrane alone exists, or the ligament is wholly absent. The cotyloid ligament (fig. 77, 6) is a prismoid cord of fibrocar- tilage, attached around the margin of the acetabulum, and serving to deepen that ca-vdty and protect its edges. It is thicker on the upper and posterior border of the acetabulum than in front, and con- sists of fibres v/liich arise from the whole circumference of the brim, and interlace with each other at acute angles. It is directed inwards towards the acetabulum. The transverse ligament is a strong fasciculus of ligamentous fibres, continuous with the cotyloid ligament, and extended across the notch of the acetabulum. It converts the notch into a foramen, through which the articular branches of the internal circumflex and obturator artery enter the joint. The fossa at the bottom of the acetabulum is filled by a mass of fat, covered with synovial membrane, which serves as an elastic cushion for the head of the bone during its movements. This was considered by Havers as the synovial gland. The synovial memhrane is extensive ; it invests the head of the femur, and is continued around the ligamentum teres into, the aceta- bulum, whence it is reflected upon the inner surface of the capsular ligament back to the head of the bone. The muscles immediately surrounding and in contact with the hip joint are, in front, the psoas and iliacus, which are separated from the capsular ligament by a large synovial bursa ; above, the short head of the rectus and the gluteus minimus ; behind, the pyiiformis, gemellus superior, obturator internus, gemellus inferior, and qua- dratus femoris ; and to the inner side, the obturator externus and pectineus. Actions.—The movements of the hip joint are very extensive; they are flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, circumduction, and rotation. 2. Knee Joint.—The knee is a ginglymoid articulation of large size, and is provided with numerous ligaments ; they are thirteen in number, namely: Anterior or ligamentum patellae, Posterior or ligamentum posticum Winslowii, Internal lateral. Two external lateral, •KNEE JOINT. 153 Anterior or external crucial, Posterior or internal crucial, Transverse, Two coronary, Ligamentum mucosum, ^ ^^^^^^ ligaments. Fig. 84.* Ligamenta alaria. Two semilunar fibro-cartilages, Synovial membrane. The first five are external to the articulation ; the next five are internal; the remaining three are mere folds of synovial membrane, and have no title to the name of ligaments. In addition to the ligaments, there are two fibrocartilages, and a synovial membrane. The anterior ligament, or ligamentum j'^citellce, is the prolonga- tion of the tendon of the extensor muscles of the thigh downwards to the tubercle of the tibia. It is, therefore, no ligament: and, as the patella is simply a sesamoid bone developed in the tendon of the extensor muscles for the defence of the front of the knee joint, the ligamentum patellae has no title to consideration, either as a ligament of the knee joint or as a ligament of the patella. A small bursa mucosa is situated be- tween the ligamentum patellse near its in- sertion and the front of the tibia ; and another jof larger size between the anterior surface of the patella and fascia lata. It is the latter which is inflamed in '' house- maid's knee." The ■ posterior ligament, ligamentum posticum Winslowii, is a broad expansion of ligamentous fibres, which covers the whole of the posterior part of the joint. It is divisible into two lateral portions, which invest the condyles of the femur, and a central portion which is depressed, and formed by the interlacement of fasci- culi passing in different directions. The strongest of these fasciculi is derived from the tendon of the semi-membranosus, and passes obliquely upwards and outwards from the posterior part of the inner tuberosity of the tibia to the external condyle of the femur. Other accessory fasci- culi are given off by the tendon of the popliteus and heads of the gastrocnemius. The middle portion of the ligament supports the * Anterior view of the ligaments of the knee joint. 1. Tendon of the quadriceps extensor muscle of the leg. 2. Patella. 3.

The internal lateral ligament is a broad and trapezoid layer of ligamentous fibres, attached above to the tubercle on the internal condyle of the femur, and below to the inner tuberosity of the tibia. It is crossed at its lower part by the tendons of the inner hamstring, from which it is separated by a synovial bursa, and it covers the anterior slip of the semimembranosus tendon and the inferior inter- nal articular artery. External lateral ligaments.—The long external lateral ligament is a strong rounded cord, which descends from the posterior part of the tubercle on the external condyle of the femur to the outer part The short external lateral ligament is an irregular fasciculus situated be- hind the preceding, arising from the external condyle near the origin of the head of the gastrocnemius muscle, and inserted into the posterior part of the head of the fibula. It is firmly connected with the external semilunar fibro-cartilage, and appears princi- pally intended to connect that carti- lage with the fibula ; sometimes it is lost superiorly in the capsular liga- ment without reaching the femur. + The long external lateral ligament is covered in by the tendon of the biceps, and has passing beneath it the tendon of origin of the popliteus muscle, and the inferior external articular artery. The true ligaments luithin the joint are the crucial, transverse, and coro- nary. The anterior, or external crucial ligament, arises from the de- pression on the head of the tibia in front of the spinous process, and passes upwards and backwards to be inserted into the inner surface of the outer condyle of the femur, as far as its posterior border. It is smaller than the posterior. The posterior, or internal crucial ligament, arises from the de- * Posterior view of the ligaments of the knee joint. 1.

This ligament is less oblique and larger than the anterior. The transverse ligament is a small slip of fibres which extends transversely from the external semilunar fibrocartilage, near its anterior extremity, to the anterior convexity of the internal cartilage. The coronary ligaments are the short fibres by which the convex borders of the semilunar cartilages are connected to the head of the tibia and the ligaments surrounding the joint. The semilunar fibrocartilages are two falciform plates of fibro- cartilage, situated upon the margin of the head of the tibia, and serving to deepen the surface of articulation for the condyles of the femur. They are thick along their convex border ; thin and sharp along their concave edge. The internal semilunar fihrocartilage forms an oval cup for the reception of the internal condyle of the femur; it is connected by its convex border to the head of the tibia and internal and posterior ligaments, by means of its coronary liga- ment ; and by its two extremities is firmly implanted into the depressions before and behind the spinous process. The ex- ternal semilunar fihrocartilage bounds a circular fossa for the external condyle : it is connected by its convex border with the head of the tibia, and to the external and posterior ligaments by its coronary ligament; by its two extremities it is in- serted into the depression between the two projections which constitute the spinous process of the tibia. The two extremi- ties of the external cartilage being in- serted into the same fossa, form almost a complete circle, and the cartilage, being somewhat broader than the internal, nearly covers the articular surface of the tibia. The external semilunar fihrocartilage, besides giving off a fasci- culus from its anterior border to consti- tute the transverse ligament, is continuous by some of its fibres with the extremity of the anterior crucial ligament ; posteriorly it divides * The right knee joint laid open from the front, in order to show the in- ternal ligaments. 1.

The ligamentum mucosum is a slender conical process of synovial membrane enclosing a few ligamentous fibres which proceed from the transverse ligament. It is connected, by its apex, with the anterior part of the condyloid notch, and by its base is lost in the mass of fat which projects into the joint beneath the patella. The alar ligaments are two fringed folds of synovial membrane, extending from the ligamentum mu- cosum, along the edges of the mass of fat to the sides of the patella. The synovial membrane of the knee joint is by far the most exten- sive in the body. It invests the cartilaginous surfaces of the con- dyles of the femur, head of tibia, and inner surface of the patella; it covers both surfaces of the semilu- nar fibrocartilages; and is reflected upon the crucial ligaments, and inner surface of the ligaments which form the circumference of the joint. On each side of the patella, it lines the tendinous aponeuroses of the vastus internus and vastus extemus * A longitudinal section of the left knee joint, showing the reflections of its synovial membrane. 1.

Fig. 87 *TIBIO-PIBULAR ARTICULATION. 157 muscles, and forms a pouch of considerable size between the extensor tendon and front of the femur. It also forms the folds in the interior of the joint, called " ligamentum mucosum," and "ligamentaalaria." The superior pouch of the synovial membrane is supported and raised during the movements of the limb by a small muscle, the subcrureus, which is inserted into it. Between the ligamentum patellse and synovial membrane is a considerable mass of fat, which presses the membrane towards the interior of the joint, and occupies the fossa betvv^een the condyles. Besides the proper ligaments of the articulation, the joint is pro- tected on its anterior part by the fascia lata, which is thicker upon the outer than the inner side, by a tendinous expansion from the vastus internus, and some scattered ligamentous fibres which are inserted into the sides of the patella. This expansion has been termed the capsular ligament. Actions.—The knee joint is one of the strongest of the articula- tions of the body, while at the same time it admits of the most per- fect degree of movement in the direction of flexion and extension. During flexion the articular surface of the tibia glides forward on the condyles of the femur; the lateral ligaments, the posterior, and the crucial ligaments are relaxed; while the ligamentiim patellae, being put upon the stretch, serves to press the adipose mass into the vacuity formed in the front of the joint. In extension all the ligaments are put upon the stretch, with the exception of the liga- mentum patellae. When the knee is semi-flexed, a partial degree of rotaiion is permitted. 3. Articulation hetioeen the Tibia and Fibula.—The tibia and fibula are held firmly connected by means of seven ligaments, namely, Anterior, ) , -r, , . \ above, rostenor, ) Interosseous membrane, Interosseous inferior. Anterior, ) , . Tj J. • \ below, rostenor, ) Transverse. The anterior superior tibio-fibular ligament is a strong fasciculus of parallel fibres passing obliquely downwards and outwards from the outer tuberosity of the tibia, to the anterior surface of the head of the fibula. The posterior superior tibio-fibular ligament, thicker and stronger than the anterior, is disposed in a similar manner on the posterior surface of the joint. Within the articulation there is a distinct synovial membrane which is sometimes continuous with that of the knee joint.158 ANKLE JOINT. The interosseous membrane or superior interosseous ligament, is a broad layer of aponeurotic fibres which pass obliquely downwards and outwards, from the sharp ridge on the tibia to the inner edge of the fibula, and are crossed at an acute angle by a few fibres taking the opposite direction. The ligament is deficient above, leaving a considerable interval between the bones, through which the anterior tibial artery takes its course forward to the anterior aspect of the leg; and below, near its lower third, there is an opening for the an- terior peroneal artery and vein. The interosseous membrane is in relation, in front, with the tibialis anticus, extensor longus digitorum, extensor proprius pollicis, anterior tibial vessels and nerve, and anterior peroneal artery; behind, with the tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, and posterior peroneal artery. The inferior interosseous ligament consists of short and strong fibres, which hold the bones firmly together inferiorly, where they are nearly in contact. This articulation is so firm, that the fibula is broken when an attempt is made to rupture the ligament. The anterior inferior tibio-fhular ligament is a broad band, con- sisting of two fasciculi of parallel fibres which pass obliquely across the anterior aspect of the articulation of the two bones at their in- ferior extremity, from tibia to fibula. The posterior inferior tibio-fhular ligament (fig. 90, 2) is a similar band on the posterior surface of the articulation. Both ligaments project somewhat below the margin of the bones, and serve to deepen the cavity of articulation with the astragalus. The transverse ligament (fig. 90, 3) is a narrow band of liga- mentous fibres, continuous with the preceding, and passing trans- versely across the back of the ankle joint between the two malleoli. The sjinovial membrane of the inferior tibio-fibular articulation, is a duplicature of the synovial membrane of the ankle joint, re- flected upwards for a short distance between the two bones. Actions.—Between the tibia and fibula there exists an obscure degree of movement, which is calculated to enable the latter to re- sist injury by yielding for a trifling extent to forcible pressure. 4. AnJde Joint.—The ankle is a ginglymoid articulation; the surfaces entering into its formation are the under surface of the tibia with its malleolus and the malleolus of the fibula, above; and the surface of the astragalus with its two lateral facets, below. The ligaments are three in number: Anterior, Internal lateral. External lateral. The anterior ligament is a thin membranous layer, passing from the margin of the tibia, to the astragalus in front of its articularANKLE JOINT. 159 surface. It is in relation, in front, with the tendons of the extensors of the great and lesser toes, tibialis anticus and peroneus tertius, and anterior tibial vessels and nerve. Posteriorly it lies Fig. 88* in contact with the extra-synovial adipose tissue and synovial mem- brane. The internal lateral or del- toid ligament is a triangular layer of fibres, attached supe- riorly by its apex to the internal malleolus; inferiorly, by an ex- panded base to the astragalus, OS calcis, and scaphoid bone. Be- neath the superficial layer of this ligament is a stronger and thicker fasciculus, which connects the apex of the internal malleolus with the side of the astragalus. The internal lateral ligament is covered in and partly concealed by the tendon of the tibialis posticus, and at its posterior part is in relation with the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, and flexor longus pollicis. The external lateral ligament consists of three strong fasciculi, which jiroceed from the inner side of the external malleolus, and diverge in three different directions. The anterior fasciculus passes forwards, to be attached to the astragalus; the posterior, back- wards, to be connected with the astragalus posteriorly; and the middle, longer than the other two, descends to be inserted into the outer side of the os calcis. "It is the strong union of this bone," says Sir Astley Cooper, with the tarsal bones, by means of the external lateral ligaments, '' which leads to its being more frequently fractured than dislocated." The transverse ligament of the tibia and fibula occupies the place of a posterior ligament of the ankle joint. It is m relation, behind, with the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, and tendon of the tibialis posticus muscle; in front, with the extra-synovial adipose tissue and synovial membrane. The synovial membrane invests the cartilaginous surfaces of the tibia and fibula (sending a duplicature upwards between their lower ends), and the upper surface and two sides of the astragalus. It is then reflected upon the anterior and lateral ligaments, and on the transverse ligament posteriorly. * Internal view of tlie ankle joint. 1. Internal malleolus of the tibia. 2, 2. Astragalus. 3.

Articulation of the Tarsal Bones.—The ligaments v/hicli con- nect the seven bones of the tarsus to each other are of three kinds,— Dorsal, Plantar, Interosseous. The dorsal ligaments are small fasciculi of parallel fibres, which pass from each bone to all the neighbouring bones with which it ar- ticulates. The only dorsal ligaments deserving of particular mention are, the external snad poste7'ior calcaneo-astragaloid, which, with the interosseous ligament, complete the articulation of the astragalus with the OS calcis; the superior and internal calcaneo-cuboid liga- ments ; and the superior astragalo-scaphoid ligament.

It is the division of this portion of these ligaments that demands the careful attention of the surgeon in performing Chopart's operation. The plantar ligaments have the same disposition on the plantar surface of the foot; three of them, however, are of large size, and have especial names, viz. the Calcaneo-scaphoid, Long calcaneo-cuboid. Short calcaneo-cuboid. Tie inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament is a broad fibrocartilagi- nous band of ligament, which passes forward from the anterior and inner border of the os calcis to the edge of the scaphoid bone. In addition to connecting the os calcis and scaphoid, it supports the astragalus, and forms part of the cavity in which the rounded head of the latter bone is re- ceived. It is lined upon its upper surface by the synovial membrane of the astra- galo-scaphoid articulation. The firm connexion of the os calcis vsdth the scaphoid bone, and the feebleness of the astragalo-scaphoid articulation, are conditions favourable to the occasional dislocation of the head of the astragalus. The long calcaneo-cuhoid, or liga- mentum longum plantce, is a long band of ligamentous fibres, which proceeds from the under surface of the os calcis to the rough surface on the under part of the cuboid bone, its fibres being continued onwards to the bases of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. This ligament forms the inferior boun- dary of a canal in the cuboid bone, through which the tendon of the peroneus longus passes to its insertion into the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe.

The interosseotis ligaments are five in number; they are short and strong ligamentous fibres situated between adjoining bones, and firmly attached to their rough surfaces. One of these, the calcaneo- astragaloid, is lodged in the groove between the upper surface of the OS calcis and the lower of the astragalus. It is large and very strong, consists of vertical and oblique fibres, and serves to unite the OS calcis and astragalus solidly together. The second interosseous ligament, also very strong, is situated between the side of the sca- phoid and cuboid bone; while the three remaining interosseous liga- ments connect strongly together the three cuneiform bones and the cuboid. The synovial membranes of the tarsus are four in number : one, for the posterior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation; a second, for the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid and astragalo-scaphoid articulation. Occasionally an additional small synovial membrane is found in the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid joint; a third, for the calcaneo-cuboid articulation; and a fourth, the large tarsal synovial membrane for the articulations between the scaphoid and three cuneiform bones, the cuneiform bones with each other, the external cuneiform bone with the cuboid, and the two external cuneiform bones with the bases of the second and third metatarsal bones. The prolongation which reaches the metatarsal bones passes forwards between the internal and middle cuneiform bones. A small synovial membrane is sometimes met with between the contiguous surfaces of the sca- phoid and cuboid bone. Actions.—The movements permitted by the articulation between the astragalus and os calcis, are a slight degree of gliding, in the direction forwards and backwards, and laterally from side to side. The movements of the second range of tarsal bones are very trifling, being greater between the scaphoid and three cuneiform bones than in the other articulations. The movements occurring between the first and second range are the most considerable : they are adduction and abduction, and, in a minor degree, flexion, which increases the arch of the foot, and extension, which flattens the arch. 6. Tarso-metatarsal Articulation.—The ligaments of this articu- lation are, Dorsal, Plantar, Interosseous. The dorsal ligaments connect the metatarsal to the tarsal bones, and the metatarsal bones to each other. The base of the second metatarsal bone, articulating with the three cuneiform bones, re-163 ARTICULATIONS OP THE PHALANGES. ceives a ligamentous slip from each, while the rest articulating with ■ a single tarsal bone receive only a single tarsal slip. The plantar ligaments have a similar disposition on the plantar surface. The interosseous ligaments are situated between the bases of the metatarsal bones of the four lesser toes; and also between the bases of the second and third metatarsal bone and the internal and external cuneiform bone. The metatarsal bone of the second toe being implanted by its base between the internal and external cuneiform bone, is the most strongly articulated of all the metatarsal bones. This disposition must be recollected in amputation at the tarso-metatarsal articu- lation. The synovial membranes of the tarso-metatarsal articulation are three in number : one for the metatarsal bone of the great toe; one for the second and third metatarsal bones, which is continuous with the great tarsal synovial membrane; and one for the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. Actions.—The movements of the metatarsal bones upon the tarsal and upon each other are very slight; they are such only as contri- bute to the strength of the foot, by permitting a certain degree of yielding to opposing forces. 7. Metatarso-phalangeal Articulation.—The ligaments of this articula;fcion, like those between the first phalanges and metacarpal bones of the hand, are, Inferior or plantar, Two lateral, Transverse. The inferior or plantar ligaments, thick and fibrocartilaginous, form part of the articulating surface of the joint. The lateral ligaments are short and very strong, and situated one on each side of the joints. The transverse ligament is a strong band, which passes trans- versely between the plantar ligaments. The expansion of the extensor tendon supplies the place of a dorsal ligament.

Muscles are the moving organs of the animal frame ; they consti- tute by their size and number the great bulk of the body, upon which they bestow form and symmetry. In the limbs they are situated around the bones, which they invest and defend, while they form to some of the joints a principal protection. In the trunk they are spread out to enclose cavities, and constitute a defensive wall capable of yielding to internal pressure, and again returning to its original position. Their colour presents the deep red which is characteristic of flesh, and their form is variously modified, to execute the varied range of movements which they are required to effect. Muscle is composed of a number of parallel fibres placed side by side, and supported and held together by a delicate web of cellular tissue ; so that, if it were possible to remove the muscular substance, we should have remaining a beautiful reticular framework, possessiag the exact form and size of the muscle without its colour and solidity. Towards the extremity of the organ the muscular fibre ceases, and the cellular structure becomes aggregated and modified, so as to constitute those glistening fibres and cords by which the muscle is tied to the surface of bone, and which are called tendons. Almost every muscle in the body is connected with bone, either by tendinous fibres, or by an aggregation of those fibres constituting a tendon ; and the union is so firm, that, under extreme violence, the bone itself rather breaks than permits of the separation of the tendon from its attachment. In the broad muscles the tendon is spread out so as to form an expan- sion, ca.lled aponeurosis (airo longe; vtvpov,* nerras, a nerve widely spread out). Muscles present various modifications in the arrangement of their fibres in relation to their tendinous structure. Sometimes they are completely longitudinal, and terminate at each extremity in tendon, the entire muscle being fusiform in shape ; in other situations they are disposed like the rays of a fan, converging to a tendinous poin^ as the temporal, pectoral, glutei, &c., and constitute a radiat-e muscle. Again, they are penniform, converging like the plumes of a pen to one side of a tendon, which runs the whole length of the muscle, as in the peronei; or hipenniform, converging to both sides of the tendon. In other muscles the fibres pass obliquely from the sur- * The ancients named all the white fibres of the body vsvpd : the term has since been limited to the nerves.STRUCTURE OP MUSCLE. 165 face of a tendinous expansion spread out on one side, to that of another extended on the opposite side, as in the semi-membranosus ; or, they are composed of penniform or bipenniform fasciculi, as in the deltoid, and constitute a compound muscle. The nomenclature of muscles is defective and confused, and is generally derived from some prominent character which each muscle presents ; thus, some are named from their situation, as the tibialis, peroneus; others from their uses, as the flexors, extensors, adductors, abductors, levators, tensors, &c. Some again from their form, as the trapezius, triangularis, deltoid, &c.; and others from their direction, as the rectus, obliquus, transversalis, &c. Certain muscles have re- ceived names expressive of their attachments, as the stemo- mastoideus, sterno-hyoideus, &c.; and others, of their divisions, as the biceps, triceps, digastricus, complexus, &c. In the description of a muscle we express its attachment by the words "origin" and "insertion": the term oW(/m is generally applied to the more fixed or centfal attachment, or to the point towards which the motion is directed, while insertion is assigned to the more move- able point, or to that most distant from the centre ; but there are exceptions to this principle, and as many muscles pull equa,lly towards both extremities, the use of such terms must be regarded as purely arbitrary. In structure, muscle is composed of bundles of fibres of variable size called fasciculi, which are enclosed in a cellular membranous invest- ment or sheath, and the latter is continuous with the cellular frame- work oi the fibres. Each fasciculus is composed of a number of smaller bundles, and these of single fibres, which, from their minute size and independent appearance, have been dis- Fig, 92 .f tinguished by the name of ultimate fibres. The ultimate fibre is found by microscopic investigation to be itself a fasciculus (ultimate fasciculus), made up of a number of ultimate fibrils enclosed in a delicate sheath or myolemma.*' Two kinds of ultimate muscular fibre exist in the animal economy ; viz., that of voluntary or animal life, and that of involuntary or organic life. The ultimate fibre of animal life is known by its size, by its uniformity of calibre, and especially by the transverse markings which occur at minute and regular * In the summer of 1836, while engaged with Dr. Jones Quain in the ex- amination of animal tissues with a simple dissecting microscope, constructed by Powell, I first saw that the tdtimate fibre of muscle was invested by a proper sheath, for which I proposed the term " Myolenraia;" a term which was adopted by Dr. Quain in the fourth edition of his " Elements of Anatomy." We at that time beheved that the transverse folding of that sheath gave rise to the appearance of transverse striae, an opinion which subsequent examina- tions proved to be incorrect. Mr. Bovrman has since employed the term " Sarcolemma," as synonymous with Myolemma, t A muscular fibre of animal life enclosed in its myolemma j the transverse and longitudinal striae are seen.STRUCTURE OF MUSCLE. 166 Fig. 93.t distances throughout its whole extent. It also presents other markings or strige, having a longitudinal direction, which indicate the existence of fibrillse within its myolemma. The myolemma, or investing sheath of the ultimate fibre, is thin, structureless, and transparent. According to Bowman, * the ulti- mate fibres or fasciculi are poly- hedral in shape and various in size; the polyhedral form being due to mutual pressure and the variety of size, besides being met with in a single muscle, being also characteristic of different classes, genera, and even sexes of ani- mals : thus the average diameter of the ultimate fibre in the human female is -j-g^, in the male -j^, the average of both being in round numbers The largest fibres are met with in fishes, in which they average -^^2 '■> Ti&^it largest are found in man; while in other classes they range in the following order:—insects ; reptiles 4g-^; mammalia -^It j hirds -g-^. The ultimate fibrils of animal life, according to Bowman, are beaded filaments presenting a regular succession of segments and constric- tions, the latter being narrower than the former, and the component substance probably less dense. An ultimate fibre consists of a bundle of these fibrils, which are so disposed that all the segments and all the constrictions corre- spond, and in this manner give rise to the alternate light and dark lines of the trans- verse striae. The fibrils are connected together with very different degrees of closeness in different animals; in man they are but slightly adherent, and distinct longitudinal lines of junction may be observed between them; they also separate very easily when macerated for some time. Besides the more usual se- paration of the ultimate fibre into fibrils, it breaks when stretched, Fig. 94.J * On the Minute Structure and Movements of Voluntary Muscle.

Mg. 96.t into transverse segments, corresponding with the dark lines of the striae, and consequently with the constrictions of the fibrillae. Where this division occurs with the greatest facility, the longi- tudinal lines are indistinct, or scarcely perceptible. "In fact," says Mr. Bowman, "the primi- tive fasciculus seems to consist of primitive component segments or particles, arranged so as to form, in one sense, fibrillse, and in ano- ther sense, discs: and which of these two may happen to present itself to the observer, will depend on the amount of adhesion, end- ways or sideways, existing between the segments. Grenerally, in a recent fasciculus, there are transverse striae, showing divisions into discs, and longitudinal striae, marking its composition by fibrillse." Mr. Bowman has observed that in the substance of the ultimate fibre there exist minute '' oval or circular discs, frequently concave on one or both surfaces, and containing, somewhere near the centre, one, two, or three minute dots or granules," Occasionally they are seen to present irregularities of form, which Mr. Bowman is in- clined to regard as accidental. They are sitiiated between and are con- nected with the fibrils, and are dis- tributed in pretty equal numbers through the fibre. These cor- puscles are the nuclei of the nucle- ated cells out of which the muscu- lar fibre was originally developed. From observing, however, that their '' absolute number is far greater in the adult than in the foetus, while their number, rela- tively to the bulk of the fasciculi, at these two epochs, remains nearly the same," Mr. Bowman believes that, " during.develop- ment, and subsequently, a further and successive deposit of cor- puscles" takes place. The corpuscles are brought into view only when the muscular fibre is acted upon by a solution of *' one of the milder acids, as the citric." * An ultimate fibre, in which the transverse splitting into discs, in the direction of the constrictions of the ultimate fibrUs, is seen.

After Bowman,168 STRUCTURE OP MUSCLE. — ? — s i Fiu. 97.t B C i — 8 - « i — 2 § 'i a S i B a a B i i i i i i 1 According to my investigations,* the ultimate fibril of animal life is cylindrical when isolated, and probably polyhedral from pressure when forming part of an ultimate fibre or fasciculus. It measures in diameter 20000 of an inch, and is composed of a succession of cells con- A B c T) nected by their flat surfaces. The cells are filled with a transparent substance, which I have termed myoline. The myoline differs in density in different cells, and from this circumstance be- stows a peculiarity of character on cer- tain of the cells. For example, when a fibril in its passive state is examined, there will be seen a series of dark ob- long bodies separated by light spaces of equal length; now, the dark bodies are each composed of a pair of cells containing the densest form of myoline, and are hence highly refractive, while the transparent spaces are constituted i_LLi_iJj' by a pair of cells containing a more fluid myoline. When the fibrils are col- lected together so as to form an ultimate fibre or fasciculus, the appearance of the cell is altered: those which look dark in the single fibril, that is, the most refractive, being ranged side by side, constitute the bright band; whUe the transparent cells of the single fibril are the shaded strife of the fibre. When the ultimate fibril is very much stretched, the two highly refractive cells appear each to be double; while the transparent space is evidently composed of four cells.

Besides these characters, there may generally be seen a dark line or several dark points in its interior, and not unfrequently the entire fibre appears enlarged at irregular distances. These appearances are due to the presence of unobliterated nuclei of cells from which the fibre was originally deve- loped. The fibres of organic life are collected into fasciculi of various size, and are held to- gether by dark nuclear fibres similar to those which bind the fasciculi of fibrous tissue (p. 120). The development of muscular fibre is efi'ected by means of the formation of nucleated cells out of an original blastema, and the con- version of those cells, by a process already de- scribed (p. 5) into the tubuli of ultimate fibres, while their contents, by a subsequent deve- lopmental action, are transformed into ulti- mate fibrils. According to this view, the cell membranes constitute the myolemma, and the contents of the cell are a blastema, out of which new cells are formed. The disposi- tion of these latter cells, in the production of fibrillse, is probably much more simple than has hitherto been conceived. In the mus- cular fil^re of organic life the process would seem to stop short of the forniation of fibrillge, the cells being accumulated without ap- parent order. The corpuscles, observed by Mr. Bowman, in foetal muscle, and the nodosities of organic fibre, are undeveloped cells and nuclei. Muscles are divided into two great classes, voluntary and involun- tary, to which may be added, as an intermediate and connecting link, the muscle of the vascular system, the heart. The voluntary, or system of animal life, is developed from the external or serous layer of the germinal membrane, and comprehends the whole of the muscles of the limbs and trunk. The involuntary, or organic system, is developed from the internal or mucous layer, and constitutes the thin muscular structure of the intestinal canal, bladder, and internal organs of generation. At the commencement of the alimentary canal in the oesophagus, and near its termination in the rectum, the muscular coat is formed by a blending of the fibres of both classes. The heart is developed from the middle, or vascular layer of the germinal membrane; and although involun- * D.

The muscles may be arranged in conformity with the general divi- sion of the body into—1. Those of the head and neck. 2. Those of the trunk. 3. Those of the upper extremity. 4. Those of the lower extremity. MUSCLES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. The muscles of the head and neck admit of subdivision into those of the head and face, and those of the neck. Muscles of the Head and Face.—These muscles may be divided into groups corresponding with the natural regions of the head and face; the groups are eight in number, namely, 1. Cranial group. 5. Superior labial group. 2. Orbital group, 6. Inferior labial group. 3. Ocular group. 7. Maxillary group, 4. Nasal group, 8. Auricular group. The muscles of each of these groups may be thus arranged— 1. Cranial group. Occipito-frontalis. 2. Orhital group. Orbicularis palpebrarum, Corrugator supercilii, Tensor tarsi. 3. Ocular group.

Cranial growp.—Occipito-frontalis. Dissection.—The occipito-frontalis is to be dissected by making a longitudinal incision along the vertex of the head, from the tubercle on the occipital bone to the root of the nose ; and a second incision along the forehead and around the side of the head, to join the two extremities of the preceding. Dissect the integument and super- ficial fascia carefully outwards, beginning at the anterior angle of the flap, where the muscular fibres are thickest, and remove it altogether. This dissection requires care; for the muscle is very thin and without attention would be raised with the integument. There is no deep fascia on the face or head, nor is it required; for here the muscles are closely applied against the bones, upon which they depend for support, whilst in the extremities the sup- port is derived^ from the dense layer of fascia by which they are invested, and which forms for each a distinct sheath. The Occipito-frontalis (epicranius) is a broad musculo-aponeu- rotic layer, which covers the whole side of the vertex of the skull, from the occiput to the eyebrow. It arises by tendinous fibres from the outer two-thirds of the superior curved line of the occipital, and from the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Its insertion takes place by means of the blending of the fibres of its anterior portion with those of the orbicularis palpebrarum, corrugator supercilii, levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and pyramidalis nasi. The muscle is fleshy in front over the frontal bone (frontalis) and behind over , thej occipital (occipitalis), the two portions being connected by a broad aponeurosis. The two muscles together with their apo- neurosis cover the whole vertex of the skull, hence their designation galea capitis; they are loosely adherent to the pericranium, but very closely to the integument, particularly on the forehead. On the sides of the head the aponeurosis (galea aponeurotica) is attached to the root of the mastoid process and processus auditorius, and becoming thin over the temporal fascia is connected with the zygoma, malar bone, and external boundary of the orbit. Relations.—This muscle is in relation by its external surface with the frontal and supraorbital vessels, supraorbital and facial nerve, temporal vessels and auriculo-temporal nerve, occipital vessels and nerves, and integument, to which it is closely adherent. Its under surface is attached to the pericranium by a loose cellular tissue which admits of considerable movement. Action.—To raise the eyebrows, thereby throwing the integument of the forehead into transverse wrinkles. Some persons have the power of moving the entire scalp upon the pericranium by means of these muscles. 2.

Lastly, divide the integument in front of the external ear upwards to the transverse incision which was made for exposing the occipito-frontalis.

The Orbicularis Palpebrarum is a sphincter muscle, sur- rounding the orbit and eyelids, and consists of two portions, external and internal. The external or orbital portion arises from a short tendon, tendo palpebrarum (tendo oculi), situated at the inner angle of the eye, from the nasal process of the superior maxillary and angular process of the frontal bone ; it encircles the orbit and is inserted into the inner border of the orbit and lower border of the tendo palpebrarum, some of its fibres being continuous with the upper segment. The internal portion (palpebralis) forms a curved plane of fibres on the eyelids, thinner and paler than the orbital portion; externally these fibres are attached to the external palpebral ligament and border of the orbit, some being continuous with the orbital portion; internally they are attached to the borders of the lacus lachrymalis and tendo palpebrarum. The borders of the palpebralis nearest the edges of the lids are thicker than the rest, and have been termed ciliaris. Mr. Haynes Walton* remarks that this portion is redder than the rest of the palpebralis, and is contiuuous with the tensor tarsi; he conceives it to be the active cause in the production of entropium. The tendo palpebrarum (tendo oculi), about two lines in length and one in breadth, is attached by one end to the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, close to the edge of the orbit; the other end bifui-cates to be inserted into the inner extremities of the tarsal cartilages ; from its inner side is given off a process which spreads out over the lachrymal sac, and is attached to the crest of the lachrymal bone; this is the reflected aponeurosis of the tendo palpe- brarum, and serves to protect the lachrymal sac. Relations.—Bj its superficial surface it is closely adherent to the integument, from which it is separated on the eyelids by a loose cellular tissue. By its deep surface it lies in contact above with the upper border of the orbit, corrugator supercilii muscle, frontal and supraorbital vessels and supraorbital nerve; below, with the la- chrymal sac, levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, levator labii snpe- rioris proprius, zygomaticus major and minor muscles, and malar bone; externally, with the temporal fascia. Upon the eyelids it is in relation with the broad tarsal ligament and tarsal cartilages, and by its upper border is connected with the occipito-frontalis. The Corrugator Supercilii is a small, narrow, and pointed muscle, situated immediately above the orbit and beneath the upper segment of the orbicularis palpebrarum. It arises from the inner extremity of the superciliary ridge, and is inserted into the under surface of the orbicularis palpebrarum. Its connexion with the orbicularis commences near the supraorbital foramen and is con- tinued outwards to the external angular process. * Medical Times and Gazette.

The Tensor Tarsi (Horner's* muscle) is a thin plane of muscular fibres, about three lines in breadth and six in length. It is best dissected by separating the eyelids from the eye, and turning them over the nose without disturbing the tendo palpebrarum oculi; then dissect away the small fold of mucous membrane called plica semi- lunaris, and some loose cellular tissue under which the muscle is concealed. It arises from the orbital surface of the lachrymal bone, and passing across the lachrymal sac, divides into two slips, which aj-e continuous with the margin of the ciliaris along the edges of the lids;+ some few of its fibres being attached to the lachrymal canals as far as the puncta. According to some anatomists the tensor tarsi is a process of the orbicularis consisting of two small fasciculi which enclose the lachrymal ducts, and then spread out upon the aponeurosis of the lachrymal sac to be inserted into the crest and cffbital surface of the lachrymal bone. Actiom.—The palpebral portion of the orbicularis acts involuntarily in closing the lids, and from the greater curve of the upper lid, upon that principally. The entire muscle acts as a sphincter, drawing at the same time, by means of its osseous attachment, the integument and lids inwards towards the nose. The corrugatores superciliorum draw the eyebrows downwards and inwards, and produce the vertical wrinkles of the forehead. The tensor tarsi, or lachrymal muscle, is an auxiliary to the orbicularis, and draws the extremities of the lachrymal canals inwards, so as to place the puncta in the best posi- tion for receiving the tears. It serves also to keep the lids in rela- tion with the surface of the eye. Dr. Horner is acqiiainted with two persons who have the voluntary power of drawing the lids inwards by these muscles so as to bury the puncta in the angle of the eye. 3.

The su- perciliary portion of the orbit may now be driven forwards by a j smart blow, and the external angular process and external wall of the orbit outwards in the same manner ; the broken fragments of the I roof of the orbit should then be removed. By this means the perios- teum will be exposed unbroken and undisturbed. Remove the periosteum from the whole of the upper surface of the exposed orbit, and examine the parts beneath. The Levator Palpebr^ is a long, thin, and triangular muscle, situated in the upper part of the orbit on the middle line ; it arises from the upper margin of the optic foramen, and from the fibrous sheath of the optic nerve; and is inserted into the upper border of the superior tarsal cartilage. Relations.—By its upper surface with the fourth nerve, supra- orbital nerve and artery, periosteum of the orbit, and in front the inner face of the broad tarsal ligament. By its under surface it rests on the superior rectus, globe of the eye and conjunctiva ; it receives its nerve and artery by this aspect.

The Rectus Inferior (depressor) arises from the inferior margin of the optic foramen by a tendon (ligament of Zinn) which is common to it, the internal and external rectus, and from the fibrous sheath of the optic nerve; it is inserted into the inferior surface of the globe of the eye, a little more than two lines from the margin of the cornea. Relations.—By its upper surface with the optic nerve, inferior oblique branch of the third nerve, adipose tissue of the orbit, and under surface of the globe of the eye. By its under surface with the periosteum of the floor of the orbit, and inferior oblique muscle. The Rectus Internus (adductor), the thickest and shortest of the straight muscles, arises from the common tendon, and from the fibrous sheath of the optic nerve; and is inserted into the inner surface of the globe of the eye at two lines from the margin of the cornea. Relations.—By its internal surface with the optic nerve, adipose tissue of the orbit and eyeball. By its outer siirface with the periosteum of the orbit; by its upper harder with the anterior and posterior ethmoidal vessels, nasal and supra-trochlear nerve. The Rectus Externus (abductor), the longest of the straight muscles, arises by two distinct heads, one from the common tendon, the other with the origin of the superior rectus fi-om the margin of the optic foramen; the nasal, third, and sixth nerves passing be- tween them. It is inserted into the outer surface of the globe of the eye, a little more than two lines from the margin of the cornea. Relations.—-Bj its internal surface with the third, nasal, sixth, and optic nerve, ciliary ganglion and nerves, ophthalmic artery and vein, adipose tissue of the orbit, inferior oblique muscle, and eye- ball. By its external surface with the periosteum of the orbit and lachrymal gland; by the upper border with the lachrymal vessels and nerve. The recti muscles present several characters in common; thus, they are thin, have each the form of an isosceles triangle, bear the same relation to the globe of the eye, and are inserted in a similar manner into the sclerotica, at about two lines from the circumference of the cornea. The points of difference relate to thickness and length; the internal rectus is the thickest and shortest, the external the longest, and the superior the most thin. The insertion of the four recti into the globe of the eye forms a tendinous expansion, which is continued as far as the margin of the cornea, and is called, tunica albuginea. The Obliquus Superior (trochlearis) is a fusiform muscle arising from the margin of the optic foramen, and from the fibrous sheatli of the optic nerve; it passes forwards to the pulley beneath the internal angular process of the frontal bone; its tendon is then reflected outwards beneath the superior rectus to the outer part' ofOCULAR GROUP. 177 tte glolbe of the eye, where it is inserted into the sclerotic coat, at about midway between the margin of the cornea and the optic nerve. The trochlea or pulley of the superior oblique muscle is a fibro- cartilaginous ring attached to the depression beneath the internal angular process of the frontal bone. The ring is flat, about a line in width, and provided with a synovial membrane, which is con- tinued together with a fibrous sheath, for a short distance, upon the tendon. Sometimes the ring is supported, or in part formed, by a process of bone. Relations.—By its superior surface with the fourth nerve, supra-trochlear nerve, and periosteum of the orbit. By the inferiw mrface with the adipose tissue of the orbit, upper border of the internal rectus and the vessels and nerves in relation with that border. The Obliquus Inferior, a thin and narrow muscle, arises from the inner margin of the superior maxillary bone, immediately external to the lachrymal groove, and passes beneath the inferior rectus, to be inserted into the outer and posterior part of the eye- ball, at about two lines from the entrance of the optic nerve. Relations.—By its superior surface with the inferior rectus muscle and eyeball; by the inferior surface with the periosteum of the floor of the orbit, and external rectus. According to Mr. Ferrall* the muscles of the orbit are separated from th^e globe of the eyeball and structures immediately sur- rounding the optic nei've, by a fascia, which is continuous with the broad tarsal ligament and tarsal cartilages. This fascia the author terms, tunica vaginalis ocul^i" it is pierced anteriorly, for the passage of the six orbital muscles, by six openings through which the tendons of the muscles play as through pulleys. The use assigned to it by Mr. Ferrall is to protect the eyeball from the pressure of its muscles during their action; by its means, also, the recti muscles are enabled to give a rotatory movement to the eyeball; and in brutes antagonize the retractor muscle. Actions.—The levator palpebrse raises the upper eyelid. The four recti, acting singly, pull the eyeball in the four directions; upwards, downvv^ards, inwards, and outwards. Acting by pairs, they carry the eyeball in the diagonal of these directions, viz. upwards and inwards, upwards and outwards, dovmwards and inwards, or downwards and outwards. Acting all together, they directly retract the globe within the orbit. The superior ol3lique muscle, acting alone, rolls the globe inwards and forwards, and carries the pupil outwards and downwards to the lower and outer angle of the orbit. The inferior oblique acting alone, rolls the globe outwards and backwards, and carries the pupil outwards and upwards to the upper and outer angle of the eye.

This muscular slip was termed by Albinus, musculus anomalus, from its attachment to the bone by both ends; and by Santorinus, musculus rJiomboideus. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the levator labii superioris proprius, levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and integu- ment ; by its deep surface with the superior maxillary and nasal bone, and with the alar and lateral cartilage of the nose. The Dilatator Naris is a thin and indistinct muscular apparatus expanded upon the ala of the nostril, and consisting of an anterior and a posterior slip. The anterior slip (levator proprius alse nasi anterior) arises from the upper border and surface of the alar carti- lage, and is inserted into the integument of the border of the nos- tril. The posterior slip (levator proprius alse nasi posterior) arises from the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, and sesamoid cartilages, and is inserted into the integument of the border of the nostril, the posterior half of its extent. These muscles are difficult of dissection, from the close adhesion of the integument to the nasal cartilages. The Depressor K'lm Nasi (myrtiformis) is brought into view by drawing upwards the upper lip and raising the mucous membrane. It arises from the superior maxillary bone in front of the roots of the second incisor and canine tooth (myrtiform fossa), and passes upwards and inwards to be inserted into the posterior part of the columna and ala nasi. It is closely connected with the deep surface of the orbicularis. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the mucous mem- brane of the mouth, orbicularis oris and levator labii superioris alaeque nasi; by its deep surface with the superior maxillary bone. Actions.—The pyramidalis nasi, as a point of attachment of the occipito-frontalis, assists that muscle in its action: it also draws down the inner angle of the eyebrow, and by its insertion fixes the aponeurosis of the compressores narium, and tends to elevate the nose. The compressores narium appear to act in expanding rather than in compressing the nares; hence probably the compressed state of the nares from paralysis of these muscles in the last moments of life, or in compression of the brain. The dilatator naris is a dilator of the nostril, and the depressor alse nasi draws downwards both the ala and columna of the nose, the depression of the latter being assisted by the naso-labialis. 5. Superior Labial Group.—Orbicularis oris, Levator labii superioris alseque nasi. Levator labii superioris proprius. Levator anguli oris, Zygomaticus major, Zygomaticus minor. The Orbicularis Oris is a sphincter muscle, completely sur- N 2180 MUSCLES OP THE FACE. rounding tlie month, and possessing consequently neither origin nor insertion. It is composed of two thick semicircular planes of fibres, which embrace the rima of the mouth, and interlace at their ex- tremities, where they are continuous with the fibres of the bucci- nator and the other muscles connected with the angle of the mouth. The upper segment is attached by means of a small muscular fasci- culus (naso-labialis) to the columna of the nose ; and other fasciculi connected with both segments, and attached to the maxillary bones, are termed "accessorii." Several anatomists consider the orbicu- laris as composed of two portions internal or marginal in immediate contact with the lips, and thick; and external, broad and thin; the separation between the two being indicated by the coronary arteries. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the integument of the lips, with which it is closely connected. By its deep surface with the milcous membrane of the mouth, the labial glands and coronary arteries being interposed. By its circumference with the numerous muscles which move the lips, and by the inner harder with the mucous membrane of the rima of the mouth. The Levator Labii Superioris Al^que Nasi (pyramidaKs) is a thin triangular muscle : it arises from the upper part of the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone; and, becoming broader as it descends, is inserted by two distinct portions, one into the ala of the nose, the other into the orbicularis oris and upper lip. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the orbicularis palpe- brarum, facial artery, and integument. By its deep surface with the superior maxillary bone, musculus anomalus, compressor naris, dilatator naris and alar cartilage. The Levator Labii Superioris Proprius (incisorius) is a thin quadrilateral muscle; it arises from the lower border of the orbit, and passing obliquely downwards and inwards, is inserted into the integument of the upper lip, its deep fibres being blended Avith those of the orbicularis. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the lower segment of the orbicularis palpebrarum, facial artery, and integument. By its deep surface with the compressor nasi, levator anguli oris, orbicu- laris oris, and infraorbital artery and nerve. The Levator Anguli Oris (caninus) arises from the canine fossa of the superior maxillary bone, and passes obliquely outwards to be inserted into the angle of the mouth ; its fibres being continued into the inferior segment of the orbicularis, and depressor anguli oris. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the levator labii supe- rioris proprius, branches of the infraorbital artery and nerve, and inferiorly with the integument. By its deep surface with the supe- rior maxillary bone and buccinator muscle. The Zygomatic muscles are two slender fasciculi of fibres wliich arise from the malar bone, and are inserted into the upper lip. The zygomaticus major descends to the angle of the mouth, and is continuous mth the inferior segment of the orbicularis, depressorINFERIOR LABIAL GROUP. 181 anguli oris and risorius Santorini. The zygomaticus minor, lying in front of the major, becomes connected with the outer border of the levator labii snperioris proprius, and is attached to the integu- ment of the upper lip. This muscle is often wanting. Relations.—The zygomaticus major is in relation hj its superji- oial surface with the lower segment of the orbicularis palpebrarum above, and with the fat of the cheek and integument for the rest of its extent. By its deep surface with the malar bone, masseter, buccinator, and the facial vessels. The zygomaticus minor being in front of the major, has no relation with the masseter, while infe- riorly it rests on the levator anguli oris. Actions.—The orbicularis oris produces the direct closure of the lips by means of its continuity, at the angles of the mouth, with the fibres of the buccinator. When acting singly in the forcible closure of the mouth, the integument is thrown into wrinkles, in consequence of its firm connexion with the surface of the muscle; its naso-labial fasciculus draws downwards the columna nasi. The levator labii superioris alseque nasi lifts the upper lip with the ala of the nose, and expands the opening of the nares. The levator labii superioris proprius is the proper elevator of the upper lip; acting singly, it draws the lip a little to one side. The levator anguli oris lifts the angle of the mouth and draws it inwards, while the zygomatici pull it upwards and outwards, as in laughing, and produce the dimple in the cheek by the latter action. In the move- ment of laughter the zygomatici are assisted by the risorius Santorini. 6. Inferior Labial Group.—Depressor labii inferioris, Depressor anguli oris, Risorius Santorini, Levator labii inferioris. Dissection.—To dissect the inferior labial region, continue the vertical section from the middle of the lower lip to the point of the chin. Then carry an incision along the margin of the lower jaw to its angle. Dissect off the integument and superficial fascia from the whole of this surface, and the muscles of the inferior labial region will be exposed. The Depressor Labii inferioris (quadratus menti) arises from the oblique line by the side of the symphysis of the lower jaw, and passing upwards and inwards, is inserted into the orbicularis muscle and integument of the lower lip. Its inner fibres interlace with those of the opposite muscle, the outer fibres reach nearly to the angle of the mouth. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the platysma myoides, part of the depressor anguli oris, and the integument of the chin with which it is closely connected. By the deep surface with the levator labii inferioris, labial glands, mucous membrane of the lower lip, and mental nerve and artery.182 MUSCLES OF THE FACE. The Depkessor Anguli oris (triangularis) is a triangular plane of muscle arising by a broad base from the external oblique ridge of the lower jaw, and inserted by its apex into the angle of the mouth, where it is continuous with the levator anguli oris, zygomaticus major, and upper segment of the orbicularis. Near its insertion it is joined by the following muscle. Relations.—By its superficial surf ace ynih. the integument; by its deep surface with the depressor labii inferioris, buccinator and branches of the mental nerve and artery. The RisoRius Santorini is a thin and triangular muscle, con- sisting of a few scattered fasciculi of fibres which arise from the fascia, covering the masseter muscle, and converge to the angle of the mouth, where they become connected with the outer border of the depressor anguli oris, and continuous with the zygomaticus major. This muscle is generally regarded as a part of the platysma myoides. The Levator Labii inferioris (levator menti) is a short but strong muscle arising from the incisive fossa of the lower jaw, and inserted into the integument of the chin. It is in relation with the mucous membrane of the mouth, with its fellow, and with the depressor labii inferioris. Actions.—The depressor labii inferioris draws the lower lip directly downwards, and at the same time a little outwards. The depressor anguli oris, from the radiated direction of its fibres, will pull the angle of the mouth either downwards and inwards, or downwards and outwards, and be expressive of grief; or acting with the levator anguli oris, zygomaticus major, and risorius Santorini, will draw the angle of the mouth upwards and backwards or directly backwards. The levator labii inferioris raises and protrudes the integument of the chin. 7. Maxillary Group.—Masseter, Temporalis, Buccinator, Pterygoideus externus, Pterygoideus internus. Dissection.—The masseter has been already exposed by the pre- ceding dissection. The Masseter {naaaaofiai, to chew,) is a short, thick, and some- what quadrilateral muscle, composed of two planes of fibres, super- ficial and deep. The superficial layer arises by a strong aponeurosis from the malar process of the superior maxillary bone, lower border of the malar bone and zygoma; and passes backwards to be inserted into the ramus and angle of the inferior maxilla. The dee}^ layer arises also from the zygomatic arch but extends farther back upon the zygoma, and passes forwards, to be inserted into the upper half of the ramus. This muscle is tendinous and muscular in structure ; and is covered in by a fascia (fascia parotideo-masseterica) which is183 MAXILLARY GROUP. connected above with the zygomatic arch, and encloses the parotid gland behind. Relations.—By its external surface with the zygomaticus major, risorius Santorini and platysma myoides, parotid gland and Stenon's duct, transverse facial artery, pes anserinus, and integument. By its internal surface with the temporal muscle, the buccinator, from which it is separated by a mass of fat, and with the ramus of the lower jaw. By its posterior border with the parotid gland ; and by the anterior border with the facial artery and vein. Dissection.—Make an incision along the upper border of the zygoma, for the purpose of separating the temporal fascia from its attachment. Then saw through the zygomatic process of the malar bone, and through the root of the zygoma near the meatus audito- rius. Draw down the zygoma, and with it the origin of the mas- seter, and dissect the latter muscle away from the ramus and angle of the inferior maxilla. Now remove the temporal fascia from the rest of its attachment, and the whole of the temporal muscle will be exposed. The Temporalis (crotaphytes) is a broad and radiating muscle, occupying a considerable extent of the side of the head, and filling the temporal fossa. It is covered in by a dense fascia (temporal fascia), which is attached along the temporal ridge on the side of the skull, extending from the external angular process of the frontal bone to the mastoid portion of the temporal; and inferiorly to the upper border of the zygoma. The muscle arises by tendinous fibres from the whole length of the temporal ridge, and by muscular fibres from, the temporal fascia and entire surface of the temporal fossa. Its fibres converge to a strong and narrow tendon, which is inserted into the apex and internal surface of the coronoid process of the lower jaw. Relations.—By its external surface with the temporal fascia (which separates it from the attollens and attrahens aurem muscle, and temporal vessels and nerves) and with the zygoma and masseter. By its internal surface with the bones forming the temporal fossa, the external pterygoid muscle, part of the buccinator, and the internal maxillary artery with its deep temporal branches. By sawing through the coronoid process near its base, and pulling it upwards, together with the temporal muscle, which may be dis- sected from the fossa, we obtain a view of the entire extent of the buccinator and external pterygoid muscle. The Buccinator {buccina, a trumpet; alveolo-labialis), the trum- peter's muscle, arises from the alveolar process of the superior maxillary bone, the external oblique line of the inferior maxillary as far forward as the second bicuspid tooth, and from the pterygo- maxillary ligament. This ligament is the raphe of imion between tlie buccinator and superior constrictor muscle, and is attached by one extremity to the hamular process of the internal pterygoid plate, and by the other to the extremity of the molar ridge. The fibres184 MUSCLES OF THE PACE. of the muscle converge towards tlie angle of the montli, where some are continuous with the levator and depressor anguli oris, and the rest cross each other, the superior being continuous with the in- ferior segment of the orbicularis oris, the inferior with the supe- rior segment. The muscle is invested externally by a thin fascia (buccal) which extends backwards to the pharynx. Relations.—By its external surface, posteriorly, with a large and rounded mass of fat, which separates the muscle from the ramus of the lower jaw, temporalis, and masseter: anteriorly with the risorius Santorini, zygomatici, levator anguli oris, and depressor anguli oris. It is also in relation with a part of Stenon's duct, (which pierces it opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw,) with the transverse facial artery, branches of the facial and buccal nerve, and facial artery and vein. By its internal surface with the buccal glands and mucous membrane of the mouth. The Pterygoideus externus is a short and thick muscle, broader at its origin than at its insertion. It arises by two heads, one from the under surface of the great ala of the sphenoid and pterygoid ridge ; the other from the external pterygoid plate, tuberosity of the palate bone and tuberosity of the superior maxillary. The fibres pass backwards to be inserted into the neck of the lower jaw and into the interarticular fibrocartilage. The internal maxillary artery passes between the two heads of this muscle. Relations.—By its external surface with the ramus of the lower jaw, temporal muscle, and internal maxillary artery; by its internal surface with the internal pterygoid muscle, internal lateral ligament of the jaw, arteria meningea media, and inferior maxillary nerve; by its upper border with the muscular branches of the inferior maxillary nerve; the internal maxillary artery passes between the two heads of the muscle, and its lower origin is pierced by the buccal nerve. The external pterygoid muscle must now be removed, the ramus of the lower jaw sawn through its lower third, and the head of the bone dislocated from its socket and withdrawn, for the purpose of seeing the pterygoideus internus. The Pterygoideus internus is a thick quadrangular muscle. It arises from the pterygoid fossa and descends obliquely backwards, to be inserted into the ramus and angle of the lower jaw : it resembles the masseter in appearance and direction, and was named by Winslow the internal masseter. Relations.—By its external surf ace w\\h. the external pterygoid, the inferior maxillary nerve and branches, the internal maxillary artery and branches, the internal lateral ligament and'the ramus of the lower jaw. By its internal surface with the tensor palati, superior constrictor and fascia of the pharynx ; and by its posterior border with the parotid gland. Actions.—The maxillary muscles are the active agents in mastica- tion, and form an apparatus beautifully fitted for that oflice. The185 AURICULAR GROUP, buccinator circumscribes the cavity of the mouth, and with the aid of the tongue keeps the food under the immediate pressure of the teeth. By means of its connexion with the superior constrictor, it shortens the cavity of the pharynx from before backwards, and becomes an important auxiliary in deglutition. The temporal, the masseter, and the internal pterygoid are the bruising muscles, drawing the lower jaw against the upper with great force. The two latter, from the obliquity of their direction, assist the external pterygoid in gxinding the food, by carrying the lower jaw forward upon the upper ; the jaw being brought back again by the deep portion of the masseter and posterior fibres of the temporal. The whole of these muscles, acting in suc- cession, produce a rotatory movement of the teeth upon each other, which, with the direct action of the lower jaw against the upper, effects the proper mastication of the food, 8. Auricular Oroup.—AttoUens aurem, Attrahens aurem, Eetrahens aurem. Dissection,—The three small muscles of the ear may be exposed by removing a square of integument from around the auricula. This operation must be performed with care, otherwise the muscles, which are extremely thin, will be raised with the superficial fascia. They are best dissected by commencing with their tendons, and thence proceeding in the course of their radiating fibres. The Attollens aurem (superior auriculae), [Figs. 184, 185], the largest of the three, is a thin triangular plane of muscular fibres, arising from the lateral portion of the galea aponeurotica and * The two pterygoid muscles. The zygomatic arch and the greater part of the ramus of the lower jaw have been removed, in order to bring these muscles into view. 1. The sphenoid origin of the ezternal pterygoid. 2.

It is in relation by its external surface with the integument, and by the internal with the galea aponeurotica and temporal fascia. The Attrahens aurem (anterior auriculge), also triangular, arises from the lateral portion of the aponeurosis of the occipito- frontalis above the zygoma, and is inserted into the spine of the helix. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument; and by the internal with the galea aponeurotica, temporal fascia and temporal artery and veins. The Retrahens aurem (posterior auriculae), arises by two (some- times three) muscular slips from the root of the mastoid process. They are inserted into the posterior surface of the concha. It is in relation by its external surface with the integument, and by its internal surface with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Actions.-—The actions of the auricular muscles are expressed in their names; they have but little power in man, but are important muscles in brutes. MUSCLES OF THE NECK. The muscles of the neck may be arranged into eight groups, cor- responding with the natural divisions of the region; they are the 1. Superficial group. 2. Depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. 3. Elevators of the os hyoides and larynx. 4. Lingual group. 5. Pharyngeal group. 6. Soft palate group. 7. Prsevertebral group. 8. Proper muscles of the larynx.

The square flap of integument thus included should be turned back from the entire side of the neck, which brings into view the superficial fascia, and on the removal of a thin layer of superficial fascia the platysma myoides will be exposed. The Platysma myoides {irXaTyg [xvg tlSog, broad muscle-like lamella ; latissimus colli; subcutaneus colli; thoraco-facialis) is a thin plane of muscular fibres, situated beneath the integument on the side of the neck; it arises from the fascia of the pectoralis major and deltoid muscle, and passes obliquely upwards and inwards to be inserted into the side of the chin, oblique line of the lower jaw, angle of the mouth, and cellular tissue of the face. The anterior fibres are continuous beneath the chin, with the muscle of the opposite side ; the next interlace with the depressor anguli oris and depressor labii inferioris; the posterior fibres are disposed in a transverse direction across the lower part of the face, arising from the fascia of the parotid gland and masseter muscle, and inserted into the angle of the mouth. The entire muscle is analo- gous to the cutaneous muscle of brutes, the panniculus carnosus. Relations.—By its external surface with the integument, with which it is closely adherent below, but loosely above. By its internal surface, below the clavicle, with the pectoralis major and deltoid; in the neck with the trapezius, sterno -mastoid, external j ugular vein and deep cervical fascia; on the face, with the parotid gland, masseter, facial artery and vein, buccinator, depressor anguli oris, and depressor labii inferioris.188 MUSCLES OP THE NECK. On raising the platysma throughout its whole extent, the stemo- mastoid is brought into view. The Sterno-cleido-mastoideus is the large ohlique muscle of the neck, and is situated between two layers of the deep cervical fascia. It arises, as implied by its name, from the sternum and clavicle (KXeidiov), and passes obliquely upwards and backwards to be inserted into the mastoid process of the temporal, and into the superior curved line of the occipital bone. The sternal portion arises by a rounded tendon, increases in breadth as it ascends, and spreads out to a considerable extent at its insertion. The clavicular portion is broad and fleshy, and separate from the sternal portion below, ^ but becomes gradually blended with the posterior surface of the latter as it ascends.

The two portions of this muscle are sometimes described as dis- tinct muscles under the names of sterno-mastoideus (nutator capitis internus, vel anticus) and cleido-mastoidetts (nutator capitis ex- ternus, vel posticus.) A sesamoid hone is sometimes found in the sternal tendon; this is regarded as the sternal rudiment of a cervical rib, and the osseous formations have been described by Breschet under the name of ossa suprasternalia vel episternalia. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the integument, platysma myoides, external jugular vein, superficial branches of the cervical plexus of nerves, and the anterior layer of the deep (Krvical fascia. By its deep surface with the deep layer of the cervical fascia, sterno-clavicular articulation, sterno-hyoid, sterno- thyroid, omo-hyoid, scaleni, levator anguli scapula, splenii, and the posterior belly of the digastricus muscle; the phrenic nerve, pos- terior scapular and suprascapular artery; the deep lymphatic glands, sheath of the common carotid and internal jugular vein, descendens noni nerve, external carotid artery and its posterior branches, and commencement of the internal carotid artery; the c€rvical plexus of nerves, pneumogastric, spinal accessory, hypoglos- sal, sympathetic and facial nerve, and parotid gland. It is pierced on this aspect by the spinal accessory nerve. The amterior border of the muscle is the posterior boundary of the great anterior triangle, the other two boundaries being the middle line of the neck in front, and the lower border of the jaw above. It is the guide to the ope- rations for the ligature of the common carotid artery and arteria innominata, and, on the left side, for oesophagotomy. The posterior border is the anterior boundary of the great posterior triangle ; the other two boundaries being the anterior border of the trapezius behind, and the clavicle below. Actions.—The platysma produces a muscular traction on the in- tegument of the neck, which prevents it from falling so flaccid in old persons as it would if the extension of the skin were the mere result of elasticity. It draws also upon the angle of the mouth, and is one of the depressors of the lower jaw. The transverse fibres draw the angle of the mouth outwards, and slightly upwards. The stemo- mastoid muscles (nutatores capitis) are the great anterior muscles of connexion between the thorax and the head. Both muscles acting together bow the head directly forwards. The clavicular portions, acting more forcibly than the sternal, give stability and steadiness to the head in supporting great weights. Either muscle acting singly would draw the head towards the shoulder of the same side, and carry the face towards the opposite side. Second Group).—Depressors of the Os Hyoides and Larynx. Sterno-hyoideus, Sterno -thyroideus, Thyro-hyoideus, Omo-hyoideus.190 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. Dissection.—These muscles are brought into view by removitig the deep fascia from off the front of the neck between the two sterno- mastoid muscles. The omo-hyoid to be seen in its whole extent requires that the stemo-mastoid muscle be divided from its origin and .turned aside. The Sterno-hyoideus is a narrow, riband-like muscle, arising from the posterior surface of the first bone of the sternum and from the posterior stemo-clavicular ligament (sometimes from the inner extremity of the clavicle, and sometimes from the cartilage of the first rib). It is inserted into the lower border of the os hyoides. The sterno-hyoidei are separated by a considerable interval at the root of the neck, approach each other as they ascend, and are again separated on the thyroid cartilage; they are frequently traversed below by a tendinous intersection. Relations.—By its external surface with the deep cervical fascia, platysma myoides and sterno-mastoid muscle ; by its internal swface with the sterno-thyroid, and thyro-hyoid muscle, and the superior thyroid artery. The Sterno-thyroideus, broader than the preceding beneath which it lies, arises from the posterior surface of the upper bone of the sternum, and from the cartilage of the first rib ; it is inserted into the oblique line on the great ala of the thyroid cartilage. The inner borders lie in contact along the middle line, and the muscles are marked by a tendinous intersection at their lower part. Some of the fibres of this muscle are continued directly into the thyro- hyoideus without intervening attachment, while others are continuous with the inferior constrictor. Relations.—Bj its external surface vnth. the sterno-hyoid, omo- hyoid, and stemo-mastoid muscle ; by its internal surface, with the trachea, inferior-thyroid veins, thyroid gland, lower part of the larynx, sheath of the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein, subclavian vein and vena innominata, and on the right side with the arteria innominata. The middle thyi'oid vein lies along its inner border. The Thyro-hyoideus is the continuation upwards of the sterno- thyroid muscle. It arises from the oblique line on the thyroid cartilage, and is inserted into the lower border of the body and into the great cornu of the os hyoides for one half its length. Relations.—By its external surface with the sterno-hyoid and omo-hyoid muscle; by its internal surface with the great ala of the thyroid cartilage, thyro-hyoidean membrane, and superior laryngeal artery and nerve. The Omo-hyoideus {(ofiog, shoulder) is a double-bellied muscle passing obliquely across the neck from the scapula to the os hyoides; it forms an obtuse angle behind the sterno-mastoid, and is retained in that position by means of a process of the deep cervical fascia which forms a sheath for the tendon and holds it in connexion with the sternum and first rib. It arises from the upper border of191 ELEVATORS OP THE OS HTOIDES. the scapula, and transverse ligament of the suprascapular notch; and is inserted into the os hyoides at the junction of the body and great cornu. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the trapezius, sub- clavius, clavicle, deep cervical fascia, platysma myoides, sterno- mastoideus, and integument. By its deep surface with the brachial plexus, scaleni muscles, phrenic nerve, sheath of the common carotid artery and jugular vein, descendens noni nerve, sterno-thyroid and thyro-hyoid muscle, and the sterno-hyoid at its insertion. The scapular portion of the muscle divides the great posterior triangle into a superior or occipital triangle, and an inferior or sub- clavian triangle; the latter contains the subclavian artery and brachial plexus of nerves ; the other two boundaries of the subclavian triangle are, the sterno-mastoid in front and the clavicle below. The hyoid portion of the muscle divides the great anterior triangle into an inferior carotid triangle situated below the muscle, and a su- perior ti'iangle which lies above the muscle, and is again subdi\dded by the digastricus into the suhmaxillary triangle and the superior carotid triangle. The other two boundaries of the inferior carotid triangle, are the middle line of the neck in front and the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid beliind. The other boundaries of the superior carotid triangle are the posterior belly of the digastricus above and the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid behind. Actions.—The four muscles of this group are depressors of the OS hyoides and larynx. The three former drawing these parts down- wards in the middle line, and the two omo-hyoidei regulating their traction to the one or other side of the neck, according to the position of the head. The omo-hyoid muscles, by means of their connexion with the cervical fascia, are rendered tensors of that portion of the deep fascia which covers the lower part of the neck, between the two sterno-mastoid muscles. Third Group.—Elevators of the Os Hyoides. Digastricus, Stylo-hyoideus, Mylo-hyoideus, Genio-hyoideus, Genio-hyo-glossus. Dissection.—These are best dissected by placing a high block beneath the neck, and throwing the head backwards. The integu- ment has been already dissected away, and the removal of some cellular tissue and fat brings them clearly into view. The Digastricus {dig, twice, yaarrip, belly, biventer) is a small muscle situated immediately beneath the side of the body of the lower jaw; fleshy at each extremity, and tendinous in the middle. It ainses from the digastric fossa and anterior border of the mastoid process of the temporal bone; pierces by its posterior belly the stylo-MUSCLES OP THE NECK. 192 hyoideus, and is inserted into a depression on the inner side of the lower jaw, close to the symphysis. The middle tendon is held in connexion with the body of the os hyoides by an aponeurotic loop, through which it plays as through a pulley; the loop being lubri- cated by a synovial membrane. A thin layer of aponeurosis is given off from the tendon of the digastricus at each side, which is connected with the body of the os hyoides, and forms a strong plane of fascia between the anterior portions of the two muscles. This fascia, the mpra-hyoiclean, is continuous with the deep cervical fascia. Relations.—By its superficial SMr/ace with the platysma myoides, stemo-mastoid, anterior fasciculus of the stylo-hyoid muscle, parotid gland, and submaxillary gland. By its deep surface with the styloid muscles, hyo-glossus, mylo-hyoideus, external carotid artery, lingual and facial arteries, internal carotid artery, jugular vein, and hypo- glossal nerve. The digastric muscle forms the two inferior bounda- ries of the submaxillary triangle, the superior boundary being the side of the body of the lower jaw. In the posterior half of the sub- maxillary triangle are situated the submaxillary gland and facial artery. The Stylo-hyoideus is a small and slender muscle situated in immediate relation with the posterior belly of the digastricus, by which it is pierced. It arises from the middle of the styloid process, its outer side, and is inserted into the body of the os hyoides near the middle line. Relations.—By its superficial swrface with the posterior belly of the digastricus, parotid gland and submaxillary gland; its deep rela,- tions are similar to those of the posterior belly of the digastricus. The digastricus and stylo-hyoideus must be removed from their connexion with the lower jaw and os hyoides, and turned aside in order to see the next muscle. The Mylo-hyoideus {fxvXr}, mola, i.e. attached to the molar ridge of the lower jaw) is a broad and triangular plane of muscular fibres, forming, with its fellow of the opposite side, the inferior wall or floor of the mouth. It arises fleshy from the molar ridge of the lower jaw as far back as the last molar tooth, and proceeds inwards and backwards to the middle line, where its fibres are continuous "with those of the opposite side, the posterior fibres being inserted into the lower border of the body of the os hyoides. At the middle line the imion is tendinous on the upper surface in front, on the lower behind, the rest being fleshy. Relations.—By its superficial or inferior swrface.^ with the pla- tysma myoides, digastricus, supra-hyoidean fascia, submaxillary gland, and submental artery. By its deep or superior surface -ndth the genio-hyoideus, genio-hyo-glossus, hyo-glossus, stylo-glossus, gus- tatory nerve, hypoglossal neiwe, Wharton's duct, sublingual gland, and mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. After the mylo-hyoideus has been examined, it should be cut away from its origin and insertion, and completely removed. The view of193 ELEVATORS OF THE OS HYOIDES. the next muscles would also be greatly improved by dividing the lower jaw a little to the side of the symphysis, and drawing it out- wards ; or removing it altogether if the ramus have been already cut across in dissecting the internal pterygoid muscle. The tongue may then be drawn out of the mouth by means of a hook. The Genio-hyoideus {yeveiov, the chin) arises from a small tubercle on the inner side of the symphysis of the lower jaw, and is Fig . 104 * inserted into the body of the os hyoides. It is a short and slender muscle, very closely connected with its fellow and with the border of the following.

The GrENio-HYO-GLOSSus (yXwo-ffa, the tongue) is a triangular muscle, narrow and pointed at its origin from the lower jaw, broad and fan-shaped at its attachment to the tongue. It arises from a tubercle immediately above that of the genio-hyoideus, and spreads out to be mserted into the whole length of the tongue, from its base to the apex, and into the os hyoides. ReLations.—By its inner surface with its fellow of the opposite side. By its outer surface with the mylo-hyoideus, hyo-giossus, stylo-glossus, lingualis, sublingual gland, lingual artery, and hypo- glossal nerve. By its upper border with the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, in the situation of the frsenum linguae; by its lower border with the genio-hyoideus. Actions.—The whole of this group of muscles acts upon the os hyoides when the lower jaw is closed, and upon the lower jaw when the OS hyoides is drawn downwards and fixed by the depressors of the OS hyoides and larynx. The genio-hyo-glossus is, moreover, a muscle of the tongue; its action upon that organ will be considered with the next group. Fourth Group.—Muscles of the Tongue. Grenio-hyo-glossus, Hyo-glossus, Lingualis, Stylo-glossus, Palato-glossus. These are already exposed by the preparation we have just made ; there remains, therefore, only to dissect and examine them. The Genio-hyo-glossus, the first of these muscles, has been de- scribed with the last group. The Hyo-glossus is a square-shaped plane of muscle, arising from the whole length of the great comu and from the body of the os hyoides; and inserted between the stylo-glossus and lingualis into the side of the tongue. The direction of the fibres of that portion of the muscle which arises from the body is obliquely backwards; and that from the great cornu obliquely forwards; hence they are described by Albinus as two muscles, under the names of basio-glossus and cerato-glossus, to which he added a third fasciculus, arising from the lesser cornu, and spreading along the side of the tongue, the chondro- glossus. The basio-glossus slightly overlaps the cerato-glossus at its upper part, and is separated from it by the transverse portion of the stylo-glossus. Relations.—By its external surface with the digastric muscle, stylo-hyoideus, stylo-glossus, mylo-hyoideus, gustatory nerve, hypo- glossal nerve, Wharton's duct, and sublingual gland. By its internal195 MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE. SWT face with the middle constrictor of the pharynx, lingualis, genio- hyo-glossns, lingual artery, and glosso-pharyugeal nerve. The Lingualis.—The fibres of this muscle (lingualis longitudi- nalis inferior) may be seen towards the apex of the tongue, issuing from the interval between the hyo-glossus and genio-hyo-glossus; it is best examined by removing the preceding muscle. It consists of a small fasciculus of fibres, running longitudinally from the base, where it is attached to the os hyoides, to the apex of the tongue. By the outer border its fibres reach the plane of longitudinal fasci- culi of the stylo-glossus and lingualis superficialis; and by its under surface it is in relation with the ranine artery. * The other muscles entering into the structure of the tongue, are the lingualis longitudinalis superior vel superficialis; and the lin- gualis transversus. The lingualis superior forms a thin plane upon the upper surface of the organ, lying immediately beneath the mucous membrane. This layer is thicker in front than behind, and is covered posteriorly by a thin layer of transverse fibres derived from the hyo-glossus. The lingualis transversus constitutes the chief bulk of the tongue, it lies between the lingualis superior and inferior, its fibres being attached on the middle line to the fibre-car- tilaginous septum of the tongue, and laterally to the mucous mem- brane; some of the fibres being continuous with those of the stylo- glossus ' and hyo-glossus, and others being connected with the lesser cornua of the os hyoides. The Stylo-glossus arises from the apex of the styloid process and from the stylo-maxillary ligament; it divides upon the side of the tongue into two portions, one transverse, which passes transversely inwards between the two portions of the hyo-glossus, and is lost among the transverse fibres of the substance of the tongue, the other longitudinal, which spreads out upon the side of the tongue, and is prolonged forwards with the lingualis as far as its tip. Professor Hyrtl of Prague has described a fasciculus of this muscle arising from the outer side of the styloid process and inserted into the cartilage of the meatus auris, under the name of stylo-auricu- laris. He states that this muscle occurs in one out of every six bodies. Relations.—By its external surface with the internal pterygoid muscle, gustatory nerve, parotid gland, sublingual gland, and mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. By its internal surface with the tonsil, superior constrictor of the pharynx, and hyo-glossus muscle. The Palato-glossus passes between the soft palate and the side of the base of the tongue, forming a projection of the mucous mem- brane, which is called the anterior pillar of the soft palate. Its fibres are spread out superiorly among the muscular fibres of the palato-pharyngeus, and inferiorly among the fibres of the stylo- glossus upon the side of the tongue. This muscle with its fellow constitutes the constrictor isthmi faucium. 0 2196 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. Actions.—The genio-liyo-glossus muscle effects several movements of the tongue. "When the tongue is steadied and pointed by the other muscles, the posterior fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus would dart it from the mouth, while its anterior fibres would restore it to its original position. The whole length of the muscle acting upon the tongue, would render it concave along the middle line, and form a channel for the current of fluid towards the pharynx, as in sucking. The apex of the tongue is directed to the roof of the mouth, and rendered convex from before backwards by the linguales. The hyo- glossi, by drawing down the sides of the tongue, render it convex along the middle line. It is drawn upwards at its base by the palato- glossi, and backwards or to either side by the stylo-glossi. Thus tfie whole of the complicated movements of the tongue may be explained, by reasoning upon the dii'ection of the fibres of the muscles, and their probable actions. The palato-glossi muscles, assisted by the uvula, have the power of closing the fauces completely, an action which takes place in deglutition. Fifth Group.—Muscles of the Pharynx. Constrictor inferior, Constrictor medius, Constrictor superior. Stylo-pharyngeus, Palato-pharyngeus. Dissection.—To dissect the pharynx, the trachea and oesophagus are to be cut through at the lower part of the neck, and drawTi up- wards by dividing the loose cellular tissue which connects the pharynx to the vertebral column. The saw is then to be applied behind the styloid processes, and the base of the skull sawn through. The vessels and loose structures should be removed from the preparation, and the pharynx stuffed with tow or wool for the purpose of distend- ing it, and rendering the muscles more easy of dissection. The pharynx is invested by a proper pharyngeal fascia. The Constrictor inferior, the thickest of the three muscles, arises from the cricoid cartilage, and the oblique line of the thyroid. Its fibres spread out and are inserted into the middle line of the pharynx, the inferior fibres being almost horizontal, the superior oblique and overlapping the middle constrictor. Relations.—By its external surface with the vertebral column, longus colli, sheath of the common carotid artery, steruo-thyroid muscle, thyi-oid gland, and some lymphatic glands. By its internal surface with the middle constrictor, stylo-pharyngeus, palato-pha- ryngeus, and mucous membrane of the pharynx. By its lower bor- der, near the cricoid cartilage, it is in relation with the recurrent nerve; and by the upper border with the superior laryngeal nerve. The fibres of origin of this muscle are blended with those of the197 MUSCLES OF THE PHARYNX. sterno-thyroid, thyro-hyoid, and crico-thyroid, and it frequently forms a tendinous arch across the latter; inferiorly it is blended with the circular fibres of the oesophagus. The muscle must be re- moved before the next can ^^9-105.* be examined. The Constrictor medius arises from the great cornu of the OS hyoides, and from the lesser cornu. It radi- ates, from its origin, upon the side of the pharynx, the lower fibres descending and being overlapped by the constrictor inferior; the upper fibres ascending, so as to cover in the con- strictor superior. It is in- serted into the raphe of the pharynx, and by a fibrous aponeurosis into the basilar process of the occipital bone. Relations. —By its ex- ternal ' surface with the vertebral column, longus colli, rectus a.nticus major, carotid vessels, inferior con- strictor, hyo-glossus, lingual artery, pharyngeal plexus of nerves, and some lymphatic glands. By its internal surface, with the superior constrictor, stylo-pharyngeus, palato-pharyngeus, and mucous membrane of the pharynx. The upper portion of this muscle must be turned down, to bring the whole of the superior constrictor into view; in so doing, the stylo-pharyngeus muscle will be seen passing behind its upper border. The Constrictor superior is a thin and quadrilateral plane of muscular fibres arising from the side of the tongue, the extremity of the molar ridge of the lower jaw, the pterygo-maxillary ligament, and the lower third of the internal pterygoid plate; and inserted into the raphe of the pharynx and basilar process of the occipital bone. Its superior fibres are arched, and leave a concave interspace between * A side view of the muscles of the pharynx. 1. The trachea. 2. Cricoid cartilage. 3. Crieo-thyroid membrane. 4.

Between the side of the pharynx and the ramus of the lower jaw is a triangular interval, the maxillo-pharyngeal space, which is bounded on the inner side by the superior constrictor muscle; on the outer side by the internal pterygoid muscle; and behind by the rectus anticus major and vertebral column. In this space are situ- ated the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and glosso- pharyngeal, pneumogastric, spinal accessory, and hypo-glossal nerve. Relations.—By its external surface with the vertebral column and muscles of the latter, behind; with the vessels and nerves con- tained in the maxillo-pharyngeal space laterally, and with the middle constrictor, stylo-pharyngeus, and tensor palati.

The Stylo-phartngeus (levator seu dilatator pharyngis) is a long and slender muscle arising from the inner side of the base of the styloid process; it descends between the superior and middle con- strictor muscle, and spreads out beneath the mucous membrane of the pharynx; it is inserted partly into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage, and partly into the internal face of the inferior constrictor. Relations.—By its external surface vnth. the stylo-glossus muscle, external carotid artery, parotid gland, and middle constrictor. By its internal surface with the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, superior constrictor, palato-pharyngeus, and mucous mem- brane. Along its lower border is seen the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which crosses it opposite the root of the tongue, to pass between the superior and middle constrictor and behind the hyo-glossus. Associated in function with the preceding is a small muscle, not always present, the salpingo*-pharyngeus (levator pharyngeus in- ternus), which arises from the lower border of the Eustachian tube near its aperture, and passes down upon the inner surface of the side of the pharynx, where it becomes united with the palato-pharyngeus. The palato-pharyngeus is described with the muscles of the soft palate. It arises from the soft palate, and is inserted into the inner surface of the pharjmx, and posterior border of the thyroid cartUage. Actions.—The three constrictor muscles are important agents in deglutition; they contract upon the morsel of food as soon as it is received by the pharynx, and convey it downwards into the oeso- phagus. The stylo-pharyngei draw the pharynx upwards, and widen it laterally. The palato-pharyngei also draw it upwards, and with tlie aid of the uvula close the opening of the fauces. The salpingo- pharyngei are elevators of the upper part of the phaiynx. * (raXTTiy^, a tube.199 MUSCLES OP THE SOFT PALATE. Sixth Group.—Muscles of the soft Palate. Levator palati, Tensor palati, Azygos uvulae, Palato-glossus, Palato-pharyngeus. Dissection.—To examine these muscles, the pharynx must be opened from behind, and the mucous membrane carefully removed from off the posterior surface of the soft palate. The Levator palati, a moderately thick muscle, arises from the extremity of the petrous bone and from the posterior and inferior aspect of the Eustachian tube, and passing down by the side of the posterior nares spreads out between the fasciculi of origin of the palato-pharyngeus; it is inserted into the middle line, where it is continuous with the muscle of the opposite side, and is overlaid by the azygos uvulae. Relations.—Externally with the tensor palati and superior con- strictor muscle; internally and posteriorly with the mucous mem- brane of the pharynx and soft palate; inferiorly it passes between the two fasciculi of origin of the palato-pharyngeus to reach its insertion. This muscle must be turned down from its origin on one side, and removed, and the superior constrictor dissected away from its ptery- goid origin, to bring the next muscle into view. The Tensor palati (circumflexus) is a slender and flattened muscle; it arises from the scaphoid fossa at the base of the internal pterygoid plate, from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, and from the anterior aspect of the Eustachian tube. It lies between the internal pterygoid muscle and internal pterygoid plate, and winding around the hamular process of the latter, expands into a tendinous aponeurosis, which is inserted into the transverse ridge on the horizontal portion of the palate bone, and at the middle line is continuous with the aponeurosis of the opposite muscle. Relations.—By its external surface with the internal pterygoid muscle; by its internal surface with the levator palati, internal pterygoid plate, and superior constrictor. In the soft palate, its tendinous expansion is placed in front of the other muscles, and in contact with the mucous membrane. The Azygos tjvul^ is a pair of small muscles situated along the mid-Hne of the soft palate. They arise from the spine of the palate bone, and are inserted into the uvula. By their anterior surface they are in relation with the levatores palati, palato-glossi and ante- rior fasciculus of the palato-pharyngei; posteriorly they have the thin posterior fasciculus of the palato-pharyngei and the mucous membrane. The two next muscles are brought into view throughout the whole200 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. of their extent, by raising the mucous membrane from off the pillars of the soft palate at each side. The Palato-glossus (constrictor isthmi faucium) is a small fasci- culus of fibres, which arises in the soft palate as a radiated expansion. from the raphe of the soft palate, where its fibres are continuous with those of the muscle of the opposite side; and is inserted into the inner surface of the pharynx and posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. This muscle is broad above where it forms the whole thickness of the lower half of the soft palate, narrow in the posterior pillar, and again broad and thin in the pharynx where it spreads out previously to its insertion. The levator palati passes to its in- sertion between the two fasciculi of origin of this muscle. Relations.—In the soft palate it is in relation with the mucous * Muscles of the soft palate. 1.

It is the projection of this small muscle, covered by mucous membrane, that forms the anterior pillar of the soft palate. It has been named constrictor isthmi faucium, from a function it performs in common with the palato- pharyngeus, viz., of con- stricting the opening of the fauces. The Palato-pharyngeus (constrictor isthmi faucium posterior) forms the poste- rior pillar of the fauces; it arises by two fasciculi201 PRiEVERTEBRAL MUSCLES. membrane both, by its anterior and ^posterior surface; above, with the levator palati, and helow with the mucous glands situated along the margin of the arch of the palate. In the posterior pillar of the palate, it is surrounded for two-thirds of its extent by mucous mem- brane. In the pharynx, it is in relation by its outer surface with the superior and middle constrictor muscle, and by its inner surface with the mucous membrane of the pharynx, the pharyngeal fascia being interposed. Actions.—The azygos uvulae shortens the uvula. The levator palati raises the soft palate, while the tensor spreads it out laterally so as to form a septum between the pharynx and posterior nares. Taking its fixed point from below, the tensor palati will dilate the Eustachian tube. The palato-glossus and palato-pharyngeus con- strict the opening of the fauces, and by drawing down the soft palate, serve to press the mass of food from the dorsum of the tongue into the pharynx.' Seventh Group.—Prcevertebral Muscles. Rectus anticus major, Rectus anticus minor, Scalenus anticus. Scalenus posticus, ; Longus colli. Dissection.—These muscles have already been exposed by the removal of the face from the anterior aspect of the vertebral column; all that is further needed is the removal of the fascia by which they are inviested. The Rectus anticus major (trachelo-suboccipitalis), broad and thick above, narrow and pointed below, arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrse; and is inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the pharynx, internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, superior cervical ganglion and trunk of the sympathetic nerve, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory nerve.

The anterior of the two fasciculi (scalenus medius) is large, and occupies all the surface of the first rib between the groove for the subclavian artery and the tuberosity. The pos- terior (scalenus posticus) is small, and is attached203 SCALENI.—LONGUS COLLI. cervicalis ascendens, and two upper levatores costarum; internally with the first intercostal muscle, first rib, pleura, inter-transverse muscles, and cervical vertebrae; and externally with the sterno- mastoid, omo-hyoid, and 'supra-scapular and transversalis colli artery. The LoNGUs colli (prsedorso-atloideus) is a long and flat muscle, consisting of two portions. The upjfter arises from the anterior tubercle of the atlas, and is inserted into the transverse processes of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebra. The lower portion arises from the bodies of the second, third, and fourth, and trans- verse processes of the fifth and sixth, and passes down the neck, to be inserted into the bodies of the three lower cervical and three upper dorsal vertebrae. We may thus arrange these attachments in a tabular form:— Origin. Insertion, Upper ) ^tlas \ transverse portion. \ ' ' ' \ processes. Lower ) bodies ( 3 lower cervical vertebrae, ,. > 5th and 6th transverse I bodies, ^ ;' ) processes . . (3 upper dorsal, bodies. In general terms, the muscle is attached to the bodies and trans" verse processes of the six superior cervical vertebrae above, and to the bodies of the last three cervical and first three dorsal below. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the pharynx, oeso- phagus, sheath of the common carotid, internal jugular vein and pneumogastric nerve, sympathetic nerve, inferior laryngeal nerve, and inferior thyroid artery. By its posterior surface it rests upon^ the cervical and upper dorsal vertebrae. Transversalis colli anterior.*—Under this name Retzius has de- scribed a small muscle (rudimentary in man but large and important in mammiferous animals) situated on the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae between the rectus anticus major and scalenus anticus. It arises hj small tendinous slips from tih.e anterior tubercles of the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae; and is inserted into the similar tubercles of the second and third vertebrae, and sometimes also into the transverse process of the atlas. Actions.'—The rectus anticus major and minor preserve the equi- librium of the head upon the atlas; and, acting conjointly with the longus colli, flex and rotate the head and the cervical portion of the vertebral column. The scaleni muscles, taking their fixed point from below, are flexors of the vertebral column; and, from above, devators of the ribs, and therefore inspiratory muscles. * Oken's Isis. 1845. Transactions of the Scandinavian Naturalists, 1842.204 MUSCLES OP THE TRUNK. Eighth Group.—Muscles of the Larynx. These muscles are described with the anatomy of the larynx, in Chapter X. MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. The muscles of the trunk may be subdivided into four natural groups : viz., 1. Muscles of the back. 2. Muscles of the thorax. 3. Muscles of the abdomen. 4. Muscles of the perineum. 1. Muscles of the Bach.—The region of the hack, in consequence of its extent, is common to the neck, upper extremities, and abdo- men. The muscles of which it is composed are numerous, and may be arranged into six layers. First Layer. Trapezius, Latissimus dorsi. Second Layer. Levator anguli scapulae, Ehomboideus minor, Ehomboideus major. Third Layer. Serratus posticus superior, Serratus posticus inferior, Splenius capitis, Splenius colli. Fourth Layer. (Dorsal group.) Sacro-lumbalis, Longissimus dorsi. Spinalis dorsi. (Cervical Grroup.) Cervicalis ascendens, Transversalis cervicis, Trachelo-mastoideus, Complexus. Fifth Lawyer. (Dorsal Group.) Semi-spinalis dorsi, Semi-spinalis colli. (Cervical Group.) Rectus anticus major. Rectus anticus minor. Rectus lateralis, Obliquus inferior, Obliquus superior. Sixth Layer. Multifidus spinee, Inter-spinales, Inter-transversales, Levatores costarum. First Layer. Dissection.—The muscles of this layer are to be dissected by making an incision along the middle line of the back, from the tubercle on the occipital bone to the coccyx. From the upper point of this incision carry a second transversely outwards to the back of205 MUSCLES OP THE BACK. the ear: inferiorly an incision must be made from the extremity of the sacrum, along the crest of the ilium, to about its middle. For convenience of dissection, a fourth may be carried from the middle of the spine to the acromion process. The integument and super- ficial fascia, together, are to be dissected off the muscles in the course of their fibres, over the whole of this region. The Trapezius muscle (trapezium, a quadrangle with unequal sides) arises from the inner third of the superior curved line of the occipital bone, from the ligamentum nuchse, and from the supra- spinous ligament and spinous processes of the last cervical and all the dorsal vertebrae. The fibres converge from these various points, and are inserted into the scapular third of the clavicle, acromion process, and upper border of the spine of the scapula, as far back as its tubercle. The inferior fibres become tendinous, near the scapula, and glide over the triangular surface at the origin of the spine, upon some loose cellular tissue. When the trapezius is dis- sected on both sides, the two muscles resemble a trapezium, or diamond-shaped quadrangle, on the posterior part of the shoulders ; hence the muscle was formerly named cucullaris (cucullns, a monk's cowl). The occipital portion of the muscle is extremely thin ; the origin of the cervical and upper part of the dorsal portion is tend;inous, and forms, with the muscle of the opposite side, a tendindus trapezium. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the integument and superficial fascia, to which it is closely adherent by its cervical portion, loosely by its dorsal portion. By its deep surface, from above down- wards, with the complexus, splenius, levator anguli scapula, supra- spinatus, a small portion of the serratus posticus superior, rhom- boideus minor, rhomboideus major, intervertebral aponeurosis which separates it from the erector spinse, and with the latissimus dorsi. The anterior border of the cervical portion of this muscle forms the posterior boundary of the posterior triangle of the neck. Its cla- vicular insertion sometimes advances to the middle of the clavicle, or as far as the outer border of the sterno-mastoid, and occasionally it has been seen to overlap the latter. This is a point to be borne in mind in the operation for ligature of the subclavian artery. The spinal accessory nerve passes beneath the anterior border, near the clavicle, previously to its distribution to the muscle. The ligamentum nuchce is a thin fibrous band extended from the tubercle and spine of the occipital bone, to the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra, where it is continuous with the supra- spinous ligament. It is connected with the spinous processes of all the cervical vertebrae, excepting the atlas, by means of a series of small fibrous slips. It is the analogue of an important elastic liga- ment in animals. The Latissimus Dorsi muscle covers the whole of the lower part of the back and loins. It arises from the spinous processes of the four or six inferior dorsal, and all the lumbar vertebra, from the supra-206 MUSCLES OP THE BACK.

The fibres from this extensive origin converge as they ascend, and cross the inferior angle of the scapula; they then curve around the lower border of the teres major muscle, and terminate in a short qua- drilateral tendon,* which lies in front of the tendon of the teres, and is inserted into the bicipital groove. A synovial bursa is inter- posed between the muscle and lower angle of the scapula, and another between the upper half of its tendon and that of the teres major; the two tendons being united inferiorly. The muscle frequently receives a small fasciculus from the scapula as it crosses its inferior angle; and its tendon gives off fibres to the deep fascia of the upper arm. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the integument and superficial fascia, the latter being very dense and fibrous in the lumbal- region, and with the trapezius. By its deep surface, from below upwards, with the erector spinse, serratus posticus inferior, inter- costal muscles and ribs, rhomboideus major, inferior angle of the scapula, and teres major. The latissimus dorsi, with the teres major, forms the posterior border of the axilla. Second Layer. Dissection.—This layer is brought into view by dividing the two preceding muscles near their insertion, and turning them to the opposite side. The Levator anquli soapul^ (trachelo-scapularis) arises by tendinous slips, from the posterior tubercles of the transverse pro- cesses of the four upper cervical vertebrae; and is inserted into'the upper angle and posterior border of the scapula, as far as the trian- gular smooth surface at the root of its spine. Being the principal elevator of the shoulder, the levator anguli scapulae has been termed musculus patienticB. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the trapezius, sterno- mastoideus, and integument. By its deep surface with the splenius colli, transversalis cervicis, cervicalis ascendens, scalenus posticus, and serratus posticus superior.

The Ehomboideus minor (dorso-scapularis; rhombus, a paralle- logram mth four equal sides) is a narrow slip of muscle, detached from the rhomboideus major by a slight cellular interspace. It arises from the spinous process of the last cervical vertebra and li- gamentum nuchse; and is inserted into the edge of the triangular surface, on the posterior border of the scapula. The Rhomboideus major arises from the spinous processes and inter-spinous ligaments of the four upper dorsal vertebrse; it is inserted into the posterior border of the scapula as far as its inferior angle. The upper and middle portion of the insertion is effected by means of a tendinous band, which is attached in a longitudinal di- rection to the posterior border of the scapula. Relations.—By their superficial surface the rhomboid muscles are in relation with the trapezius, and the rhomboideus major also with the latissimus dorsi and integument; by their deep surface with the serratus posticus superior, erector spinse, intercostal muscles and ribs. Third Layer. Dissection.—The third layer consists of muscles which arise from the spinous processes of the vertebral column, and pass outwards. It is brought into view by dividing the levator anguli scapulae near its insertion, and reflecting the two rhomboid muscles upwards from their insertion into the scapula. The latter muscles should now be removed. The Serratus posticus superior (dorso-costalis) is situated at the upper part of the thorax; it arises fi'om the ligamentum nuchse, and spinous processes of the last cervical and two upper dorsal vertebree. The muscle passes obliquely downwards and outwards, and is inserted by four serrations into the upper border of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs, a little beyond their angles. Relations.—By its supjerficial surface with the trapezius, rhom- boideus major and minor, and serratus magnus. By its deep surface with the splenius, erector spinse, intercostal muscles and ribs. The Serratus posticus inferior (lumbo-costalis) arises from the spinous processes and interspinous ligaments of the two lower dorsal and two or three upper lumbar vertebrae, and passing obliquely up- wards, is inserted by four serrations into the lower border of the four inferior ribs. Both muscles are constituted by a thin aponeurosis for about half their extent. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the latissimus dorsi, its tendinous origin being inseparably connected with the aponeui'osis of that muscle. By its deep surface with the erector spinje, inter- costal muscles and lower ribs. The upper border is continuous with a thin tendinous layer, the vertebral aponeurosis. The Vertebral aponeurosis (fascia lumbo-dorsal^s) is a thin mem-tERTEBRAL APONEUROSIS.—SPLENIUS. 209 branous expansion composed of longitudinal and transverse fibres, and extending from the sacrum to tlie upper part of the dorsal region. It is thicker below than above, and is attached on the middle line to the spinous processes of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae, inferiorly to the spinous processes of the sacrum and aponeurosis of the erector spinse, and externally to the posterior part of the crest of the ilium, posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis, and angles of the ribs. In its passage upwards it is blended with the tendon of the serratus posticus inferior, and at the upper part of the dorsal region is either connected with the lower border of the serratus posticus superior, or is continued upwards beneath it to become lost in the fascia of the cervical muscles. The vertebral aponeurosis forms the posterior wall of a triangular sheath, which contains the erector spinas and deep muscles of the back; the other boundaries of the sheath being the spinous processes of the vertebral column internally, and the sacrum, lumbar fascia, transverse processes of the lumbar and dorsal vertebrae, and ribs, in front. The serratus posticus superior must be removed from its origin and turned outwards, to bring into view the whole extent of the splenius muscle. The Splenius muscle is single at its origin, but divides soon after into two portions, which are destined to distinct insertions. It arises, from the lower half of the ligamentum nuchse, from the spinous process of the last cervical, and spinous processes and in- terspinou's ligaments of the six upper dorsal vertebrae; it divides as it ascends the neck into the splenius capitis and splenius colli. The splenius capitis (cervico-mastoideus) is inserted into th-e rough surface of the occipital bone between the two curved lines, into the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and into the posterior border of the mastoid process. The splenius colli (dorso-trachelius) is inserted into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the three upper cervical vertebrae. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the trapezius, sterno- mastoideus, levator anguli scapulae, rhomboideus minor and major, and serratus posticus superior. By its deep surface with the spinalis dorsi, longissimus dorsi, semi-spinalis colli, complexus, trachelo- mastoideus, and transversalis cervicis. The tendons of insertion of the splenius colli are interposed between and united with the tendons of the levator anguli scapulae in front, and the transversalis cervicis behind. The splenii of opposite sides of the neck leave between them a triangular interval, in which the complexus is seen. Fourth Layer. ■Dissection.—The two serrati and two splenii muscles must be re- moved by cutting them away from their origins and insertions, and the vertebral aponeurosis laid open, to bring the fourth layer into view, pMUSCLES OF THE BACK, 210 Three of these muscles: viz., sacro-lum'balis, longissimus dorsi, and spinalis dorsi, are associated under the name of erector spinse. They occupy the lumbar and dorsal portion of the back. The re- maining four are situated in the cervical region. The Sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi arise by a common origin from the posterior third of the crest of the ilium, the oblique sacro-iliac ligament, articular and spinous tubercles of the sacrum, spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrse, and deeply from the pos- terior transverse tubercles of the lumbar vertebrse; the external portion being fleshy, the internal tendinous. The tendinous portion is broad and flat and gives origin by its deep surface to a consider- able part of the muscular fibres. In the lumbar region, the muscle proceeding from this extensive origin is a broad and thick musculo- tendinous mass, on the surface of which, opposite the last rib, a line of separation is apparent, the outer portion, about one third, being the sacro-lumbalis, the inner two thirds the longissimus dorsi. The sacro-lumbalis (ilio-costalis, TheUe) ascends upon the chest, internally to the angles of the ribs, and is inserted by separate slips, the four upper tendinous, the two lower fleshy, into the angles of the six lower ribs. If this muscle be turned a little outwards, a number of tendinous slips will be seen which take their origin from the upper border of the ribs near their angles, and terminate in muscular fasciculi by which the sacrolumbalis is prolonged to the upper part of the chest. This is the musculus accessorius ad sacro-lumbalem; it arises from the six lower ribs; and is inserted by separate tendons into the angles of the six upper ribs and transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. Retzius considering the separation of the accessorius as a difficulty to the student, treats it as the costal portion of the sacro-lumbalis, which latter he then describes as dividing into two sets of tendons, external or ascending, and internal or descending. These tendons cross each other in their course, and are inserted into the angles of all the ribs. The longissimus dorsi is inserted by two series of tendons internal and external; the internal being implanted into the posterior trans- verse tubercles of the lumbar, and transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebrse; the external into the transverse processes (lumbar ribs) of the lumbar vertebrse and all the ribs, excepting the first, between their tubercles and angles. The Spinalis dorsi arises from the spinous processes of the two upper Ivimbar and two lower dorsal vertebrse, and is inserted into the spinous processes of the upper dorsal vertebrse from the second to the sixth or eighth. It also receives several fasciculi from the longissimus dorsi and semi-spinalis dorsi. The two muscles form an ellipse, which appears to enclose the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrse.

By its deep surface (in the lumbar region) witli the multifidus spirias, transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and lumbar fascia, which separates it from the quadratus lumborum; (in the dorsal region) with the multifidus spinse, semi-spiaalis dorsi, levatores costarum, intercostal muscles, and ribs as far as their angles. Internally or mesially with the multifidus spinae, and semi- spinalis dorsi, which separate it from the spinous processes and arches of the vertebrae. The fascia lumborum, with the spinal column, vertebral aponeu- rosis and ribs, form a complete osseo-aponeurotic sheath for the erector spinas. The Cervicalis ascendens vel descendens is the continuation of the sacro-lumbalis upwards into the neck. It arises from the angles of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs, and is inserted by slender tendons into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae. The term descendens, applied to this muscle, can only be correct when it is described as arising in the neck and passing downwards to the ribs. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the levator angiili scapulae; by its deep su/rface with the upper intercostal muscles and ribs, and intertransverse muscles; externally with the scalenus posticus; and internally with the transversalis cervicis. The tendons of insertion are interposed between the attachments of the scalenus posticus and transversalis cervicis with which they are united. The Transvebsalis cervicis would appear to be the continuation upwards into the neck of the longissimus dorsi; it arises from the transverse processes of the five or six upper dorsal vertebrae, and is. inserted into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, from the second to the sixth. It receives a fasciculus from the longissimus dorsi and several small slips from the trachelo-mastoideus. Relations.—By its superficial snrface with the levator anguli scapulae, splenius and longissimus dorsi. By its deep surface with. the complexus, trachelo-mastoideus and vertebrae; externally with the musculus accessorius ad sacro-lumbalem and cervicalis ascen- dens; internally with the trachelo-mastoideus and complexus. The tendons of insertion of this muscle are intei'posed between the ten- dons of insertion of the cervicalis ascendens on the outer side, and those of origin of the trachelo-mastoid on the inner side. The Trachelo-mastoideus (complexus parvus) is likewise a con- tinuation upwards from the longissimus dorsi. It is a slender and delicate muscle, arising from the transverse processes of the three upper dorsal and last cervical, and from the articular processes of the three next cervical vertebrae, its origin being similar to that of the complexus, with which and the origin of the transversalis cer- vicis it is closely connected. It receives a fasciculus from the lon- gissimus dorsi, and is inserted into the posterior border and summit of the mastoid process.COMPLEXUS. —SEMI-SPINALES. 213 Relations.—The same as those of the preceding muscle, excepting that it is interposed between the transversalis cervicis and complexus. The Complexus (trachelo-occipitalis) is a large muscle, and with the splenius forms the great bulk of the back of the neck. It crosses the direction of the splenius, arising from the transverse processes of the three upper dorsal and last cervical, and from the articular pro- cesses of the three next lower cervical vertebrae; and is inserted into the rough surface on the occipital bone between the two curved lines, as far as the occipital spine. The complexus is marked in the upper part of the neck by a transverse tendinous intersection. A large fasciculus of the complexus lying superficially to that muscle, and remarkable for consisting of two fleshy bellies with an intermediate tendon, is usually described under the name of biventer cervicis. Considered as a separate muscle, it arises by three or four slips from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae from the fourth to the seventh; and is inserted into the inner portion of the superior curved line of the occipital bone. Its tendons of origin lie internally to the insertions of the longissimus dorsi, and are con- nected with those of the semi-spinalis colli; and its lower belly re- ceives a fasciculus from the longissimus. The outer border of the upper belly is united with the complexus; in the rest of its course it is free. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the trapezius, splenius, trachelo-mastoideus, transversalis cervicis, and longissimus dorsi. By its deep surface with the semi-spinalis dorsi and colli, recti and obliqui. It is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by the Kgamentum nuchse, and from the semi-spinalis colli by the profunda cervicis artery, princeps cervicis branch of the occipital, and pos- terior cervical plexus of nerves. Fifth Layer. ■ Dissection.—The muscles of the preceding layer are to be re- moved by dividing them transversely through the middle, and turn- ing one extremity upwards, the other downwards. In this way the whole of the muscles of the fourth layer may be dissected off, and the remaining muscles of the spine brought into a state to be ex- amined. The Semi-spinales muscles are connected with the transverse and spinous processes of the vertebrae, spanning one-half the verte- bral column; hence their name, semi-spinales. The Semi-spinalis dorsi arises from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae from the sixth to the tenth; and is inserted into the spinous processes of the four upper dorsal and two lower cervical vertebrae. It is united below with the spinalis dorsi, and above with the semi-spinalis colli; it also sends several small slips to the longissimus dorsi.214 MUSCLES OP THE BACK. The Semi-SPINALIS colli, larger than the preceding, arises from the transverse processes of the five or six upper dorsal verte- brse; and is inserted into the spinous processes of the cerricai vertebrae from the second to the fifth. Relations.—By their superficial surface the semi-spihales are in relation from below upwards with the spinalis dorsi, longissimus dorsi, complexus, splenius, profunda cervicis and princeps cervicis artery, and posterior cervical plexus of nerves. By their deep sur- face with the multifidus spinse muscle. On the middle line in the cervical region is a small muscle, which is the analogue of the spinalis dorsi, the spinalis cervicis. It is ex- tremely irregular; and arises from the spinous processes of the two upper dorsal or two lower cervical vertebrae; to be inserted into the spinous process of the axis, and sometimes into the next one or two vertebrae. Occipital Group.—This group of small muscles is intended for the movements of the cranium on the atlas, and the atlas on the axis. The Eectus posticus major (superficialis) arises from the spinous process of the axis; and is inserted into the inferior curved line of the occipital bone. The Rectus posticus minor (profundus) arises from the spinous tubercle of the atlas; and is inserted into the rough surface of the occipital bone, beneath the inferior curved line. The Rectus lateralis arises from the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the rough surface of the occipital bone, externally to the condyle. The Obliquus inferior (major) arises from the spinous process of the axis, and passes obliquely outwards to be inserted into the extremity of the transverse process of the atlas. The Obliquus superior (minor) arises from the extremity of the transverse process of the atlas, and passes obliquely inwards to be inserted into the rough surface of the occipital bone, between the curved lines. Relations.—By their superficial surface the recti and obliqui are in relation with a strong aponeurosis which separates them from the complexus. By their deep surface with the atlas and axis. The rectus posticus major partly covers in the rectus minor. The rectus lateralis is in relation by its anterior surface with the internal jugular vein, and by its posterior surface with the vertebral artery. Sixth Layer. Dissection.—The semi-spinales muscles must be removed to obtain a good view of the multifidus spinse, which lies beneath them, and215 MULTIPIDUS SPIN^.—INTERSPINALES. fills up the concavity between the spinous and transverse processes, the whole length of the vertebral column. The MuLTiPiDUS Spinje, consisting of about twenty-two small muscular fasciculi, extends along the vertebral groove from the sacrum to the axis. The muscle commences by tendinous fibres, on the dorsum of the sacrum, proceeding from the lateral tubercles of the sacrum and even from the lateral cornu of the coccyx, and passing obliquely upwards and inwards to the spinous tubercles. The fasciculi arise inferiorly from the sacrum, ilium, and tendon of the erector spinse; in the lumbar region from the articular and pos- terior transverse processes of the vertebrae; in the dorsal region from the transverse processes; and in the cervical region from the articular processes of the four inferior vertebrae. They are inserted into the spinous processes and laminae of all the vertebrae from the sacrum to the axis. Of the twenty-two fasciculi, six are lumbar, twelve dorsal, and four cervical. Each fasciculus, separate belov/, spreads out as it ascends, and passing over the next vertebra is inserted into the four or five following. The muscle is thick in- feriorly ; and the uppermost fasciculus is larger than those which it succeeds. Under the name of rotatores dorsi, expressive of their action, Theile has described eleven pairs of small muscles, which appear to belong tjo the multifidus spin^, though separated from it by cellular tissue. The rotatores arise from the apex and upper border of a transverse process; to be inserted into the lower border of the lamina of the vertebra above, as far as the base of the spinous pro- cess. The inferior rotatores are somewhat larger than the superior. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the longissimus dorsi, semi-spinalis dorsi, and semi-spinalis colli. By its deep surface with the laminae and spinous processes of the vertebral column, and in the cervical region with the ligamentum nuchae. The Interspinales are small muscular slips arranged in pairs and situated between the spinous processes of the vertebrae. In the cervical region there are six pairs of these muscles, the first being placed between the axis and third vertebrae, the sixth between the last cervical and first dorsal; they are attached to the apices of the spinous processes, and are separated by the interspinous ligaments. In the dorsal region, rudiments of these muscles are occasionally met with between the upper and lower vertebrae, but are absent in the rest. In the lumbar region there are six pairs of interspinales, the first pair occupying the interspinous space between the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebra, the last the space between the fifth lumbar and sacrum. They are thin, broad, and imperfectly de- veloped. Rudimentary iaterspuiales are occasionally met with be- tween the lower pai*t of the sacrum and the coccyx; these are the analogues of the caudal muscles of brutes ; in man they have been named collectively the extensor coccygis (sacro-coccygeus posticus).TABLE OF ORIGIN AND INSERTION 216 OKIGIISr. Layers. ■{ •{ 1 1st Layer.

The .Intertransveksales (intertransversarii) are small quad- rilateral muscles situated between the transverse processes of the vertebrae. In the cervical region they are arranged in pairs corre- sponding with the double conformation of the transverse processes, the vertebral artery and anterior division of the cervical nerves lying between them. The rectus anticus minor and rectus lateralis represent the intertransversales between the atlas and cranium. In the dorsal region the anterior intertransversales are represented by the intercostal muscles, while the posterior are mere tendinous bands, muscular only between the first and last vertebrae. In the lumbar region, the anterior intertransversales are thin, and occupy only part of the space between the transverse processes. Analogues of posterior intertransversales exist, in the form of small muscular fasciculi (interobliqui, interaccessorii) extended between the rudi- mentary posterior transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrse. The Levatores oostartjm (supra-costales) are divided into long and short. The short (breves), twelve in number on each side, arise from the apex and lower border of the transverse process of the last cervical and eleven upper dorsal vertebrae ; and pass down- wards and outwards, radiating in their descent, to be inserted into the upper border of all the ribs, between the tuberosity and angle. The uppermost muscle is the smallest, and they increase in breadth from above downwards. The levatores costarum longi, four in number on each side, arise from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrse, from the seventh to the tenth, and are inserted into the four lower ribs; each muscle passing over a rib in its descent, and being attached to the rib below as far as its angle. The levatores longi lie super- ficially to the levatores breves and increase in size from above downwards. Relations.—^By their superficial siirface with the sacrolumbalis, longissimus dorsi and transversalis cervicis. By their deep surface with the ribs and intercostal spaces ; the levatores breves close the intercostal spaces, and are united by their external border with the intercostales externi. With regard to the origin and insertion of the muscles of the back, the student should be informed that no exact regularity attends their attachments. At the best, a knowledge of theii* pre- cise connexions, even were it possible to retain it, would be but a barren information, if not absolutely injurious, as tending to exclude more valuable learning. I have therefore endeavoured to arrange a plan, by which they may be more easily recollected, by placing them in a tabular form (pp. 216, 217), that the student may see at a glance, the origin and insertion of each, and compare the natural grouping and similarity of attachments of the various layers. In this manner, also, their actions will be better comprehended, and learnt with greater facility. In examining this table, the student will observe the constant219 LEVATOEES COSTAEUM. recurrence of the number/oitr in the origin and insertion of the muscles. Sometimes the four occurs at the top or bottom of a region of the spine, and frequently includes a part of two regions, tajking two from each, as in the case of the serrati. Again, he will perceive that the muscles of the upper half of the table take their origin from spinous processes, and pass outwards to transverse, whereas the lower half arise mostly from transverse processes. To the student we commit these reflections, and leave it to the peculiar tenor of his own mind to make such arrangements as will be best retained by his memory. Actions.—The upper fibres of the trapezius draw the shoulder upwards and backwards; the middle fibres, directly backwards ; and the lower downwards and backwards. The lower fibres also act in producing rotation of the scapula upon the chest. If the sho.ulder be fixed, the upper fibres will flex the spine towards the corresponding side. The latissimus dorsi is a muscle of the arm, drawing it backwards and downwards, and at the same time rotating it inwards ; if the arm be fixed, the latissimus dorsi will draw the spine to that side, and, raising the lower ribs, be an inspiratory muscle ; and if both arms be fixed, the two muscles will draw the whole trunk forwards, as in climbing or walking on crutches. The levator anguli scapulse lifts the upper angle of the scapula, and with it the en|iire shoulder, and the rhomboidei carry the scapula and shoulder upwards and backwards. The serrati are respiratory muscles acting in opposition to each other, the serratus posticus superior drawing the ribs upwards, and thereby expanding the chest; the inferior drawing the lower ribs downwards, and diminishing the cavity, of the chest. The former is an inspiratory, the latter an expiratory muscle. The splenii muscles of one side draw the vertebral column backwards and to one side, and rotate the head towards the corresponding shoulder. The muscles of opposite sides acting together, draw the head directly backwards. They are the natural antagonists of the stemo-mastoid muscles. The sacro-lumbalis with its accessory muscle, the longissiraus dorsi and the spinalis dorsi, are known by the general term of erector spince, which sufficiently expresses their action. They keep the spine supported in the vertical position by their broad origin from below, and by means of their insertion, by distinct tendons, into the ribs and spinous processes. Being made up of a number of distinct fasciculi, which alternate in their actions, the spine is kept erect without fatigue, even when they have to counter- balance a corpulent abdomen. The continuations upwards of these muscles into the neck preserve the steadiness and uprightness of that region. When the muscles of one side act alone, the neck is rotated upon its axis. The complexus, by being attached to the occipital bone, draws the head backwards, and counteracts the muscles of the anterior part of the neck. It assists also in the rotation of the head.MUSCLES OF THE THORAX. 220 The semi-spinales and multifidus spince muscles act directly on the vertebrae, and contribute to the general action of supporting the vertebral column erect. The four little muscles situated between the occiput and the first two vertebrae, effect the various movements between these bones ; the recti producing the antero-posterior actions; the obliqui the.rotatory motions of the atlas on the axis. The actions of the remaining jnuscles of the spine, the inter- ■spinales and inter-transversales, are expressed in their names. They approximate their attachments and assist the more powerful muscles in preserving the erect position of the body. The levatores costarum raise the posterior parts of the ribs, and are probably more serviceable in preserving the articulation of the ribs from displacement, than in raising them in inspiration. MUSCLES OF THE THORAX. The principal muscles situated on the front and sides of the thorax' belong in their actions to the upper extremity, with which they will be described. They are the pectoralis major and minor, sub- clavius and serratus magnus. The true thoracic muscles are few in number, and appertain exclusively to the actions of the ribs; they are, Intercostales extemi, Intercostales interni, Subcostales, Triangularis sterni. The intercostal muscles are two planes of muscular and tendinous fibres directed obliquely between the adjacent ribs and closing the intercostal spaces. They are seen partially on the removal of the pectoral muscles, or on the inner surface of the chest. The trian- gularis sterni is within the chest, and requires the removal of the anterior part of the thorax to bring it into view. The Intercostales Externi, eleven on each side, commence posteriorly at the tubercles of the ribs, and advance forwards to the costal cartilages, where they terminate in a thin aponeurosis which is continued onwards to the sternum. Their fibres are directed obliquely downwards and inwards, pursuing the same line with those of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. They are thicker than the internal intercostals, and more tendinous in structure. The Intercostales Interni, also eleven on each side, commence anteriorly at the sternum, and extend backwards as far as the angles of the ribs, whence they are prolonged to the vertebral column by a thin aponeurosis. Their fibres are directed obliquely dowTiwards and backwards, and correspond in direction with those of the in-TRIANGULARIS STERNI. 221 ternal oblique muscle of tlie abdomen. The two muscles cross each other in the direction of their fibres. In structure the intercostal muscles consist of an admixture of muscular and tendinous fibres. They arise from the two lips of the lower border of the ribs, the external from the outer lip, the internal from the inner; and are inserted into the upper border, encroaching somewhat on the surfaces. The SuBCOSTALES (infracostales; intracostales) are nine or ten small muscles situated within the thorax at its posterior part, and lying upon the ribs. They increase in size from above downwards, and the direction of their fibres corresponds with that of the inter- costales interni. Each muscle arises from the front of a rib, and is inserted into the front of the rib but one below; the first sub- costalis is often absent. Relations.—The external intercostals, by their external surface^ with the muscles which immediately invest the chest, viz., pectoralis major and minor, serratus magnus, serratus posticus superior and inferior, scalenus posticus, sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi with their continuations the cervicalis ascendens and transversalis cervicis, levatores costarum, and obliquus externus abdominis. By their internal surface with the internal intercostals, intercostal vessels and nerves, and posteriorly with the pleura, a thin aponeu- rosis being interposed. The internal intercostals, by their external surf ace,with, the external intercostals, and intercostal vessels and nerves;' by their internal surface with the pleura costalis, trian- g-ularis sterni, subcostales, and diaphragm. The Triangularis sterni (sterno-costalis), situated upon the inner wall of the front of the chest, arises by a thin aponeurosis from the side of the sternum, ensiform cartilage, and sternal ex- tremities of the costal cartilages from the third to the sixth or seventh; it is inserted by fleshy digitations into the second, third, fourth, and fifth costal cartilages and corresponding ribs. Relations.—By its external mr/ace'with the sternum, ensiform cartilage, costal cartilages, internal intercostal muscles, and internal mammary vessels. By its internal surface with the pleura costalis, cellular tissue of the anterior mediastinum, and diaphragm. The lower fibres of the triangularis sterni are continuous with those of the transversalis abdominis. A ctions. —The intercostal muscles raise the ribs when they act from above, and depress them when they take their fixed point from below. They are, therefore, both inspiratory and expiratory muscles. The triangularis sterni draws down the costal cartilages, and is therefore an expiratory muscle.222 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. The muscles of this region are, the— Obliquus extemiis (descendens), Obliquus internus (ascendeus), Cremaster, Transversalis, Rectus, PjTamidalis, Quadratus lumborum, Psoas parvus, Diaphragma. Dissection.—The dissection of the abdominal muscles is to be commenced by making three incisions:—The first, vertical, in the middle line, from over the lower part of the sternum to the pubes; the second, oblique, from the umbilicus, upwards and outwards, to the outer side of the chest, as high as the fifth or sixth rib; and the third, ohlique, from the umbilicus, downwards and outwards, to the crest of the ilium and along the crest to its middle. The three flaps included by these incisions should then be dissected back in the direction of the fibres of the external oblique muscle, beginning at the angle of each. The integument and superficial fascia should be dissected off together, so as to expose the fibres of the muscles at once. When the external oblique muscle is dissected on both sides, a white tendinous line will be seen along the middle of the abdomen, extending from the ensiform cartilage to the pubes; this is the linea alba. A little external to it, on each side, two curved lines will be observed extending from the eighth rib to the spine of the pubes, and bounding the recti muscles; these are the linece semikinares. Some transverse lines, linear transversce, three in number, connect the linese semilunares with the linea alba at and above the um- bilicus. The External oblique muscle {obliquiis externus abdominis, descendens; costo-abdominalis) is the external flat muscle of the ab- domen. Its name is derived from the obliquity of its direction, and the descending course of its fibres. It arises by fleshy digitations from the external surface of the eight inferior ribs; the five upper digitations being received between coiTesponding processes of the serratus magnus, and the three lower of the latissimus dorsi. Soon after its origin it spreads out into a broad aponeurosis, which is inserted into the outer lip of the crest of the ilium for one half its length, the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, spine of the pubes, pectineal line, front of the pubes, and linea alba.INTERNAL OBLIQUE MUSCLE. 223 Tlie lower border of the aponeurosis, which, is stretched between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the spine of the pubes, is round from being folded inwards, and forms Pouparfs ligament (ligamentum Fallopii; arcus cruralis); the insertion into the pectineal line is Gimhernat''s ligament. Just above the crest of the pubes is the external ahdominal ring (annulus abdominalis externus), a triangular opening formed by the separation of the fibres of the aponeurosis of the external oblique. It is oblique in its direction and corresponds with the course of the fibres of the aponeurosis. It is bounded below by the crest of the pubes; on either side by the borders of the aponeurosis, which are called pillars; and above by some curved fibres [intercoluvmar) which originate from Poupart's ligament, and cross the upper angle of the ring, so as to give it strength. The external pillar, which is at the same time inferior from the obliquity of the opening, is in- serted into the spine of the pubes; the internal or superior pillar forms an interlacement with its fellow of the opposite side over the front of the symphysis pubis. The external abdominal ring gives passage to the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female : they are both invested in their passage through it by a prolongation of the fascia of the external oblique muscle, the intercolumnar fascia, or fascia spermatica. The pouch of inguinal hernia, in passing through this opening, receives'the intercolumnar fascia as one of its coverings. Relations. —By its external surface with the superficial fascia and integument, and with the cutaneous vessels and nerves, particularly the superficial epigastric and superficial circumflexa ilii vessels. It is generally overlapped posteriorly by the latissimus dorsi. By its internal surface with the internal oblique, the lower part of the eight inferior ribs and intercostal muscles, the cremaster, sper- matic cord in the male, and round ligament in the female. The upper border of the external oblique is continuous with the pecto- ralis major. The external oblique is now to be removed by making an incision across the ribs, just below its origin, to its posterior border; and an- other along Poupart's ligament and the crest of the ilium. Poupart's ligament should be left entire, as it gives attachment to the next muscles. The muscle may then be turned forwards towards the linea alba, or removed altogether. The Internal oblique muscle (obliquus intermis abdominis, ascendens; ilio-abdominalis) is the middle flat muscle of the abdomen. It arises from the outer half of Poupart's ligament, from the middle of the crest of the ilium for two-thirds its length, and from the fascia lumborum. Its fibres diverge from their origin, so that those from Poupart's ligament curve downwards, those from the anterior part of the crest of the ilium pass transversely, and the rest ascend ob- liquely. The muscle is inserted into the pectineal line and crest of the pubes, linea alba, and lower border of the four inferior ribs.MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 224 Mg. 110.* * Muscles of the anterior aspect of the trunk; on the left side the super- ficial layer is seen, on the right the deeper layer. 1.

'The external abdominal ring; the margin above the ring is the superior or internal pillar; the margin below theCREMASTER. 225 Along the upper three-fourths of the linea semilunaris, the aponeu- rosis of the internal oblique separates into two lamellae, which pass one in front, the other behind the rectus muscle to the linea alba, where they are inserted; along the lower fourth, the aponeurosis passes altogether in front of the rectus without separation. The two layers, which thus enclose the rectus, form for it a partial sheath. The lowest fibres of the internal oblique are inserted into the pec- tineal line of the pubes in common with those of the transversalis muscle. Hence the tendon of this insertion is called the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis. This structure corresponds with the external abdominal ring, and forms a protec- tion to what would otherwise be a weak point in the abdomen. Sometimes the tendon is insufficient to resist the pressure from within, and becomes forced through the external ring; it then forms the distinctive covering of direct inguinal hernia. The spermatic cord passes beneath the arched border of the internal oblique muscle, between it and Poupart's ligament. During its pas- sage some fibres are given ojGf from the lower border of the muscle, which accompany the cord downwards to the testicle, and form loops around it; this is the cremaster muscle. In the descent of oblique inguinal hernia, which travels the same course as the spermatic cord, the cremaster muscle forms one of its coverings. The Cremaster, considered as a distinct muscle, arises from the middle ;of Poupart's ligament, and forms a series of loops upon the spermatic cord. A few of its fibres are inserted into the tunica vaginalis, the rest (crus internum) ascend along the inner side of the cord, to be inserted, with the conjoined tendon, into the pecti- neal line of the os pubis. Relations.—The internal oblique is in relation by its external sur- face with the external oblique, latissimus dorsi, spermatic cord, and external abdominal ring. By its internal surface with the transver- salis muscle, fascia transversalis, internal abdominal ring, and sper- matic cord.

QMUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 226 The internal oblique muscle is to be removed by separating it from its attachments to the ribs above, the crest of the ilium and Poupart's ligament below. It should be divided behind by a vertical incision extending from the last rib to the crest of the ilium, as its lumbar attachment cannot at present be examined. The muscle is then to be turned forwards. Some degree of care will be required in per- forming this dissection, from the dif&culty of distinguishing between this muscle and the one beneath. A thin layer of cellular tissue is all that separates them for the greater part of their extent. Near the. crest of the ilium the circumflexa ilii artery ascends between the two muscles, and forms a guide to their separation; but just above Poupart's ligament they are so closely connected, that separation is impossible. The Transversalis (lumbo-abdominalis) is the internal flat muscle of the abdomen; and is transverse in the direction of its fibres, as implied in its name. It arises from somewhat less than ►the outer half of Poupart's ligament, from the internal lip of the crest of the ilium, its anterior two-thirds ; from the transverse pro- cesses of the lumbar vertebrae, and from the inner surface of the six inferior costal cartilages. As high as the fourth or fifth rib it is continuous with the diaphragm, and above this point, with the triangularis sterni. Its lower fibres curve downwards, to be in- serted, with the lower fibres of the internal oblique, into the pecti- neal line, and form the conjoined tendon. Throughout the rest of its extent it is inserted into the crest of the pubes, linea alba and ensiform cartilage. The loioer fourth of its aponeurosis passes in front of the rectus to the linea alba; the upper three-fourths, with the posterior lamella of the internal oblique behind it. The posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis divides into two lamellae, anterior and posterior, which constitute the fascia lum- horum. The anterior lamella is attached to the ba^ of the trans- verse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, the posterior to their apices, the two layers enclosing and forming a sheath for the quadratus lumborum muscle. The posterior layer receives the attachment of the posterior aponeurosis of the internal oblique, and farther back, near the border of the erector spinse, it becomes united with the aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi. It thus assists in the formation of a second sheath, which encloses the erector spinge, the anterior boundary of that sheath being the posterior lamella of the transver- salis, the posterior boundary the aponeurosis of the serratus posticus inferior and latissimus dorsi. Relations.—By its external surface with the internal oblique, the internal surface of the six lower ribs, and internal intercostal muscles. By its internal surface with the transversalis fascia, which separates it from the peritoneum, witli the psoas magnus, the lower part of the rectus, and pyramidalis. The spermatic cord and oblique inguinal hernia pass beneath the loiver border, but have no direct relation with it.227 TRANSVERSALIS. To dissect the rectus nmscle, its sheath should be opened by a vertical incision extending from over the cartilages of the lower ribs to the front of the os pubis. The sheath may then be dissected off and turned to either side; this is easily done excepting at the linete transversse, where a close adhesion subsists between the muscle and Fig. Ill * * Lateral view of the truiik, showing its muscles, particularly the trans- versahs abdominis. 1.

The sheath contains the rectus and pyramidalis muscle. The Rectus (stemo-pubius) arises by a double tendon from the front and crest of the os pubis, and is inserted by three broad digi- tations into the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs. It is traversed by several tendinous intersections, called lineae trans- versse (inscriptiones tendinese). One of these is situated at the um- bilicus, one over the ensiform cartilage, and one midway between these points; when a fourth exists, it occurs below the umbilicus. The linese transversse are vestiges of the abdominal ribs of reptiles, and very rarely extend completely through the muscle. Relations.—By its external surface with the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the internal olalique, below with the aponeurosis of the transversalis, and with the pyramidalis. By its internal surface with the ensiform cartilage, cartilages of the ribs from the fifth to the ninth, posterior lamella of the internal oblique, perito- neum, and epigastric artery and veins. The Pyramidalis (pubio-subumbilicalis) arises from the crest of the OS pubis in front of the rectus, and is inserted into the linea alba at about midway between the umbilicus and pubes. It is enclosed in the sheath with the rectus, and rests against the lower part of that muscle; it is sometimes absent. The rectus may now be divided across the middle, and the two ends drawn aside for the purpose of examining the mode of formation of its sheath. The sheath of the rectus is formed, in front, for the upper three- fourths of its extent, by the aponeurosis of the external oblique and anterior lamella of the internal oblique; hehind by the posterior lamella of the internal oblique and aponeurosis of the transversalis. At the commencement of the lower fourth, the posterior wall of the sheath terminates in a thin curved margin (plica semilunaris, Doug- lassii) the aponeuroses of the three muscles passing altogether in front of the rectus. The next two muscles can be examined only when the viscera of the abdomen are removed. To see the quadratus lumborum, it is also necessary to divide and draw aside the psoas muscle and the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the transversalis. The Quadratus lumborum (ilio-costalis) is concealed from view by the anterior lamella of the aponeui'osis of the transversalis muscle, which is inserted into the bases of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. When this lamella is divided, the muscle will be seen to consist of two portions :—one, the external, arising from the ilio-lumbar ligament and outer lip of the crest of the ilium for two inches in extent, and inserted into the apices of the transverse pro- cesses of the four upper lumbar vertebrae (sometimes also last dorsal) and last rib ; the other, the internal and anterior portion, arises by tendinous slips from the transverse processes of the three or four lower lumbar vertebrae, and passes upwards to be inserted into the229 PSOAS PARVUS. DIAPHRAGMA. lower border of the last rib. If the muscle be cut across or removed, the posterior lamella of the transversalis will be seen attached to the apices of the transverse processes; the quadratus being enclosed between the two lamellae as in a sheath. Relations.—Enclosed in the sheath formed by the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle, it is in relation, in front, with the kidney, the colon, psoas magnus, and diaphragm. Behind, but also sepa- rated by its sheath, with the erector spinse. The Psoas parvus is a small and infrequent muscle which arises from the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebra and from the inter- vertebral substance between them, and terminates in a long slender tendon which expands inferiorly and is inserted into the ilio-pecti- neal line and eminence. The tendon is continuous by its outer border with the iliac fascia. Relations.—It rests on the psoas magnus, and is covered in by the peritoneum; superiorly it passes beneath the ligamentum arcua- tum internum of the diaphragm. Diaphragm A.—To obtain a good view of this important inspira- tory muscle, the peritoneum should be dissected from its under surface. It is a transverse muscular septum between the thorax and abdomen, and is composed of two portions, thoracic and lumbar, the former being named the greater, the latter the lesser muscle. The thoracic portion or greater muscle arises from the ensiform cartilage by a distinct slip and from the internal surface of the six inferior ribs indigitating with the transversalis. The fibres converge to be inserted into the central tendon. A triangular interval exists between the sternal and costal portion of the muscle at each side, closed by a few irregular muscular fibres and by the ssrous membranes of the cavity of the chest and abdomen. A protrusion of any portion of the contents of the abdomen through this opening constitutes phrenic or diaphragmatic hernia. The lumbar portion or lesser muscle consists of a right and left lateral half (pillars, crura); each of which is composed of three smaller pillars or crura, internal, middle, and externaL The critra arise from the front and lateral aspect of the bodies of the first, second, and third lumbar vertebrae, from the interverte- bral substance between the first, second, third, and fourth, from the transverse process of the first, ligamentum arcuatum internum and externum, and last rib. The left cms is shorter than the right by the breadth of a vertebra, and does not advance so far forward on the front of the vertebral column. The lesser muscle is inserted into the whole length of the posterior border of the central tendon. The origin of the lesser muscle takes place by a strong tendon on each side, from which and from the other points of attachment mus- cular fibres proceed. The internal pillar of the crus is its anterior fasciculus, which proceeds from the third lumbar vertebra ; the middle pillar, smaller than the others, proceeds from the second vertebra; the external pilla,r, the largest of the three, from theMUSCLES OP THE ABDOMEN. 230 first lumbar vertebra, ligamenta arcuata and last. rib. The internal pillars approach each other as they ascend, the arched interval between them being the aortic opening; their internal fibres con- sisting of several fasciculi cross each other in front of the aortic opening and form the lateral boundaries of another opening of ellip- * Under or abdominal side of the diaphragm. 1, 2, 3.

In the decussation between the aortic and oesophageal opening the fibres of the right internal pillar are generally the most superficial. Between the lumbar and costal portion of the diaphragm on each side is a triangular interval like that between the costal and sternal portion, closed only by cellular tissue and the serous membranes of the two cavities. The ligamentum arcuatum internum is a tendinous arch thrown across the upper part of the psoas muscle from the side of the body of the first lumbar vertebra to the apex of its transverse process, extending sometimes also to that of the second. Beneath this arch the psoas magnus emerges from the chest. The ligamentum arcuatum externum is a tendinous band ex- tended from the apex of the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra to the lower border of the last rib. It forms an arch across the quadratus lumborum and is continuous with the sheath of that muscle derived from the aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis. The tendinous centre of the diaphragm is shaped like a trefoil leaf, of which the central leaflet points to the ensiform cartilage, and is the largest; the lateral leaflets, right and left, occupy the corresponding portions of the muscle; the right being the larger and more rounded, the left smaller and lengthened in its form. The 0(penings in the diaphragm are three : one, quadrilateral, in the tendinous centre, at the union of the right and middle leaflets, for the passage of the inferior vena cava ; a muscular opening of an elliptical shape formed by the internal pillars, for the transmission of the oesophagus and pneumogastric nerves ; a third, the aortic, which is formed by a tendinous arch thrown from the tendon of one pillar to that of the other, beneath which pass the aorta and thoracic duct. The great splanchnic nerve passes through th£ diaphragm between the internal and middle pillar of the crus ; and the trunk of the sympathetic and vena azygos between the middle and external pillar. The lesser splanchnic nerve escapes between those fibres of the external pUlar which proceed from the ligamentum arcuatum internum. Relations.—By its superior surf ace with, thepleurse, pericardium, heart, and lungs. By its inferior surface with the peritoneum; an the left with the stomach and spleen; on the right with the con- vexity of the liver; and behind with the kidneys, supra-renal capsules, duodenum, and solar plexus. By its circumference with the ribs and intercostal muscles, and vertebral column. Actions.—The external oblique muscle, acting singly, would draw the thorax towards the pelvis, and twist the body to the opposite side. Both muscles, acting together, flex the thorax directly on the pelvis. The internal oblique of one side draws the chest down- wards and outwards: both together bend it directly forwards. Either transversalis muscle, acting singly, will diminish the size of232 MUSCLES OP THE PEKINEUM. the abdomen on its own side, and both together will constrict the entire cylinder of the cavity. The recti muscles, assisted by the pyramidales, flex the thorax towards the pelvis, and, through the medium of the line^ transversse, are enabled to act when their sheath is curved inwards by the action of the transversales. The pyramidales are tensors of the linea alba. The abdominal are expiratory muscles, and the chief agents of expulsion; by their action the foetus is expelled from the uterus, the urine from the bladder, faeces from the rectum, bUe from the gall-bladder, ingesta from the stomach and bowels in vomiting, and mucus and irritattag substances from the bronchial tubes, trachea, and nasal passages, during coughing and sneezing. To produce these effects, they all act together. Their violent and continued action produces hernia ; and, acting spasmodically, they may occa- sion rupture of the viscera. The quadratus lumborum draws the last rib downwards, and is an expiratory muscle ; it also serves to bend the vertebral column to one or the other side. The psoas parvus is a tensor of the iliac fascia, and, taking its fixed origin from below, it may assist in flexing the vertebral column forwards. The diaphragm is an inspiratory muscle, and the sole agent in tranquil inspiration. When in action, the muscle is drawn down- wards, its plane being rendered oblique from the level of the ensiform cartilage, to that of the upper lumbar vertebra. During relaxation it is convex, and encroaches considerably on the cavity of the chest, particularly at the sides, where it corresponds with the lungs. It assists the abdominal muscles powerfully in expulsion, every act of that kind being preceded or accompanied by a deep inspiration. Spasmodic action of the diaphragm produces hiccough and sobbing, and its rapid alternation of contraction and relaxation, combined with laryngeal and facial movements, laughing and crying. MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM. The muscles of the perineum are situated in the outlet of the pelvis, and consist of two groups, one of which belongs especially to the organs of generation and urethra, the other to the termination of the alimentary canal. To these may be added the anterior muscles of the coccyx. The muscles of the perineal region in the male, are the Accelerator urinse, Sphincter ani, Erector penis. Levator ani, Transversus perinei, Coccygeus, Compressor urethr£e, Sacro-coccygeus anticus. Dissection.—To dissect the perineum, the subject should be fixed in the position for lithotomy, that is, the hands should be bound to the soles of the feet, and the knees kept apart. An easier plan isACCEIERATORES TJEIN^.—TRANSVERSUS PERINEI. 233 the drawing of the feet upwards by means of a cord passed through a hook in the ceiling. Both of these means of preparation have for their object the full exposure of the perineum. And as this is a dissection which demands some degree of delicacy and nice manipula- tion, a strong light should be thrown upon the part. Having fixed the subject, and drawn the scrotum upwards by means of a string or hook, carry an incision from the base of the scrotum along the ramus of the pubes and ischium and tuberosity of the ischium, to a point parallel with the apex of the' coccyx; then describe a curve over the coccyx to the same point on the opposite side, and continue the incision onwards along the opposite tuberosity and ramus of the ischium and pubes, to the opposite side of the scrotum, where the two extremities may be connected by a transverse incision. This incision will completely surround the perineum, following very nearly the outline of its boundaries. Now let the student dissect off the integument carefully from the whole of the included space, and he will expose the fatty cellular structure of the common superficial fascia, which resembles the superficial fascia in other situations. The common superficial fascia is then to be removed to the same extent, exposing the superficial perineal fascia. This layer is also to be turned aside, when the muscles of the genital region of the perineum will be brought into view. The AccELERATORES URiNiE (bulbo-cavemosi) arise from a ten- dinous 'point in the centre of the perineum and from the fibrous raphe of the two muscles. From this origin the fibres diverge like the plumes of a pen; the posterior to be inserted into the trian- gular ligament and ramus of the pubes ; the middle, to encircle the corpus spongiosum and meet on its upper side ; the anterior to spread out upon the corpus cavernosum on each side, and be inserted, partly into its fibrous structure, and partly into the fascia penis. The posterior and middle insertion of these muscles are best seen, by carefully raising one muscle from the corpus spongi- osum and tracing its fibres. Relations.—By their superficial surface with the superficial perineal fascia, dartos, superficial vessels and nerves of the perineum, and on each side with the erector penis. By their deep surface with the corpus spongiosum and bulb of the urethra. The Erector penis (ischio-cavernosus) arises from the tuberosity of the ischium and from the ramus of the pubes on each side of the crus, and curves around the root of the penis ; to be inserted into the upper surface of the corpus cavernosum, where it is continuous with a strong fascia which covers the dorsum of the organ, the fascia penis. Relations.—By its sujoerficial surface with the superficial perineal fascia, dartos, and superficial perineal vessels and nerve. By its deep surface with the corpus cavernosum penis. The Transversus perinei arises from the ramus of the ischium at each side, and is inserted into the central tendinous point of the234 MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM. perineum ;* where it is coimected with the accelerator urinfe and sphincter ani. A small slip of muscle is sometimes found in front of the trans- versus perinei : this is the transversus perinei alter. By its inner end it is continuous with the accelerator. Relations.—By its stiperficial surface with the superficial perineal fascia, and superficial perineal vessels and nerves. By its deep sur- face with the triangular ligament and internal pudic artery and veins. By its posterior border it is in relation with that portion of the superficial perineal fascia which passes up to become continuous with the triangular ligament. To dissect the comioressor uretlircB, the three preceding muscles should be removed, so as to render the glistening surface of the ta-iangular ligament apparent. This ligament should then be care- fully dissected away, and the corpus spongiosum penis divided through its middle, separated from the corpus cavernosum, and drawn forwards in order to put on the stretch the membranous portion of the urethra, with which the muscles are connected. The compressor urethrse is, however, better seen in a dissection made from within the pelvis, after having turned down the bladder from its attachment to the os pubis, and removed a plexus of veins and the pelvic fascia. The Compressor URETfiRiE (constrictor urethrse membranacese, constrictor isthmi urethrse) directed transversely across the peri- neum above the triangular' ligament arises from the ramus of the pubes and ischium, at their point of union, and from the anterior ligament of the bladder and prostate gland. Proceeding inwards it divides into two fan-shaped fasciculi, superior and inferior, which embrace the membranous portion of the urethra, and are continuous with the muscle of the opposite side. The superior fasciculus is continued forwards to the junction of the crura penis, and back- wards to the prostate gland ; upon the upper surface of which it is spread out. The inferior fasciculus is attached to the bulb of the urethra in front, and extends to the prostate gland behind. A third fasciculus, closely united with the two preceding, consists of circular fibres, which enclose and form a muscular sheath for the membranous part of the urethra. Under the name of Wilson's muscles, a fourth fasciculus has been described as descending vertically from the body of the pubes, near the symphysis, to unite with the superior fasciculus of the compressor urethrae. This fasciculus is inconstant and its existence doubtful. * I have twice dissected a perineum in which the transversus perinei was of large size, and spread out as it approached the middle hne so as to become fan- shaped. The posterior fibres were continuous with those of the muscle of the opposite side; but the anterior were prolonged forwards upon the bulb and corpus spongiosimi of the m-ethra as far as the middle of the penis, form- ing a broad layer which usurped the place and office of the accelerator urmae.SPHINCTER ANI, 236 The Sphincter ani is a thin and elliptical plane of muscle closely- adherent to the integument, and surrounding the opening of the anus. It a/rises posteriorly in the superficial fascia around the coccyx, and by a fibrous raphe from the apex of that bone; and is inserted anteriorly into the tendinous centre of the perineum, and into the raphe of the integument, nearly as far forward as the commence- ment of the scrotum. M</. 113.* Relations.—By its superficial mrface with the integument. By its deep swrface with the internal sphincter, levator ani, cellular tissue and fat of the ischio-rectal fossa, and in front with the super- ficial perineal fascia. The Sphincter ani internus is a muscular band embracing th« extremity of the intestine, and formed by an aggregation of the cir- cular muscular fibres of the rectum. Part of the levator ani may be seen during the dissection of the^ anal portion of the perineum by removing the &t which surrounds the termination of the rectum in the ischio-rectal fossa. But, to study the entire muscle, a lateral section of the pelvis must be made * Muscles of the perineum. 1. Aeceleratores urinae; the figure rests on the corpus spongiosum penis. 2.

The pelvic fascia is then to be carefully raised, beginning at the base of the bladder and proceeding upwards, until the whole extent of the muscle is exposed. The Levator ani is a thin plane of muscular fibres, situated on each side of the pelvis. The muscle arises from the inner sui-face of the OS pubis near the pubic arch, from the base and upper border of the spine of the ischium, and between these points, from a tendinous arch which occupies the line of division of the pelvic fascia into obturator fascia and recto-vesical fascia. Its fibres descend to be inserted into its fellow of the opposite side beneath the prostate gland, into the rectum, and behind the rectum into its fellow of the opposite side and the side of the extremity of the coccyx. In the female this muscle has an additional insertion into the vagina. Relations.—By its external or perineal surface, with, a thin layer of fascia, by which, and by the obturator fascia, it is separated fr^om the obutrator internus muscle; with the fat in the ischio-rectal fossa, triangular ligament, sphincter ani, and posteriorly with the gluteus maximus. By its internal or pelvic surface with the pelvic fascia, which separates it from the viscera of the pelvis and fr'om the peritoneum. The CoccYGEUs muscle is thin and triangular. It arises from the spine of the ischium and lesser sacro-ischiatic ligament, and spreads out to be inserted into the side of the coccyx and lower part of the sacrum. Relations.—itsinternal orptelmc surface with the cavity of the pelvis; by its external surface with the lesser sacro-ischiatic ligament; and by its borders, with the pyriformis above and levator ani below. The Sacro-coccygeus anticus (curvator coccygis), the analogue of an important muscle in brutes, but rudimentary in man, and more tendinous than fleshy in structure, is a small muscle which arises from the side of the last piece of the sacrum and first of the coccyx ; and is inserted into the front of the last piece of the coccyx in common with its fellow of the opposite side. Sometimes it gives lateral ofi"- sets to the outer side of the second and third pieces of the coccyx. Female Perineum.—The muscles of the perineum in the female are the same as in the male, and have received analogous names. They are smaller in size, and are modified to suit the different form of the organs; they are Constrictor vaginre. Compressor urethrse, Erector clitoridis, Sphincter ani, Transversus perinei. Levator ani, Coccygeus. The Constrictor vagina is analogous to the accelerator lu'inae of the male ; it arises from the tendinous centre of the perineum, whereFEMALE PEKINEUM. 237 it is continuous with the sphincter ani and transversus perinei; and passes forwards on each side of the entrance of the vagina, to be inserted into the corpus cavernosum clitoridis. The Erector clitoridis arises from the ramus of the ischium, and is inserted on each side into the crus clitoridis. It is in rela- tion by its inner border with the constrictor vagina. The Transversus perinei is a small muscle arising on each side from the ramus of the ischium, and inserted into the side of the constrictor vaginse. The Compressor urethra has the same origin and insertion, and exercises the same functions in the female as in the male. The Sphincter ani and Sphincter ani internus surround the lower extremity of the rectum, as in the male. The Levator ani is inserted into the side of the vagina and rectum. Actions.—The acceleratores urinae being continuous at the middle line, and attached on each side to the triangular ligament, by means of their posterior fibres, support the bulbous portion of the urethra, and acting ^suddenly, propel the semen, or the last drops of urine from the canal. The posterior and middle fibres, according to Krause, * contribute towards the erection of the corpus spongiosum, by pro- ducing compression on the venous structure of the bulb; and the anterior fibres, according to Tyrrell, + assist in the erection of the entire organ by compressing the vena dorsalis, by means of their in- sertion into the fascia penis. The erector penis becomes entitled to its name from spreading out upon the dorsum of the organ into a membranous expansion (fascia penis), which, according to Krause, compresses the dorsal vein during the action of the muscle, and especially after the erection of the organ has commenced. The transverse muscles serve to steady the tendinous centre, that the muscles attached to it may obtain a firm point of support. According to Cruveilhier, they draw the anus backwards during the expulsion of the faeces, and antagonise the levatores ani which carry the anus for- wards. The compressor urethra, taking its fixed point from the ramus of the ischium at each side, can, says Mr. Grutlirie, '' compress the urethra so as to close it; I conceive completely, after the manner of a sphincter." The external sphincter, being a cutaneous muscle, contracts the integument around the anus, and by its attachment to the tendinous centre and point of the coccyx, assists the levator ani in giving support to the opening during expulsive efforts. The in- ternal sphincter contracts the extremity of the cylinder of the intes- tine. The use of the levator ani is expressed in its name. It is the antagonist of the diaphragm and the rest of the expulsory muscles, and serves to support the rectum and vagina during their expulsive efforts. The levator ani acts in unison with the diaphragm, and rises * Miiller Archiv fiir Anatomie, Physiologie, &c. 1S37. t Leetiu'es in the College of Surgeons. 1839.MUSCLES OP THE TIPPER EXTREMITY. 238 and falls like that muscle in forcible respiration. Yielding to the propulsive action of the abdominal muscles, it enables the outlet of the pelvis to bear a greater force than a resisting structure, and on the remission of such action it restores the perineum to its original form. The coccygei muscles restore the coccyx to its natural position, after it has been pressed backwards during defsecation or during parturition. MUSCLES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY.

Dissection.—Make an incision along the line of the clavicle, from the upper part of the sternum to the acromion process; a second along the lower border of the great pectoral muscle, from the lower end of the sternum to the insertion of its tendon into the humerus; and connect the two by a third, carried longitudinally along the middle of the sternum. The integument and superficial fascia are to be dissected together from off the fibres of the muscle, and always in the direction of their course. For this purpose the dissector, if he have the right arm, will commence with the lower angle of the flap; if the left, with the upper angle. He will thus expose the pectoralis major muscle in its whole extent. Pectoralis major, Pectoralis minor, Subclavius. The Pectoralis major (sterno-humeralis) arises from the sternal half of the clavicle, from half the sternum its whole length, from the cartilages of all the true ribs, excepting the first and last, and from the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. From this extensive origin the fibres converge to be inserted by a broad tendon into the anterior bicipital ridge of the humerus. The pectoralis major admits of a division into three portions,240 MUSCLES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. clavicular, sternal, and costal; the two former are separated from each other by a well marked cellular interspace; the latter is dis- tinguished not only by its origin, but also by forming a fold beneath the sternal portion, and lying altogether behind it at its insertion. At this point the three portions are superimposed, the .clavicular portion being in front, the sternal portion next, and the costal por- tion behind; the clavicular portion being prolonged at its insertion to the lower extremity of the bicipital ridge, and the costal portion to its upper end. Relations.—By its external surface with the fibres of origiQ of the platysma myoides, the mammary gland, superficial fascia and integument. By its internal surface, on the thorax, with the clavicle, sternum, costal cartilages, intercostal muscles, subclavius, pectoralis minor, and serratus magnus; in the axilla, with the axil- lary vessels and glands. By its external border with the deltoid, from which it is separated above by a cellular interspace lodging the cephalic vein and descending branch of the thoracico-acromialis artery. Its lower border forms the anterior boundary of the axillary space. The pectoralis major is now to be removed by dividing its fibres along the lower border of the clavicle, and then carrying the incision perpendicularly downwards, parallel to the sternum, and at about three inches from its border. Divide some loose cellular tissue, and several small branches of the thoracic arteries, and reflect the muscle outwards. We thus bring into view a region of considerable interest, in the middle of which is situated the pectoralis minor. The Pectoralis minor (costo-coracoideus) arises by three digita- tions from the front and upper border of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs near their cartilages; and is inserted by a broad tendon into the anterior border and apex of the coracoid process of the scapula. It is closely united at its insertion with the coraco-brachialis. Relations.—By its anterior surf ace with the pectoralis major and superior thoracic vessels and nerves. By its posterior surface with the ribs, intercostal muscles, sei'ratus magmas, axillary space, and axillary vessels and nerves. Its upper border forms the lower boundary of a triangular space, bounded above by the costo-coracoid membrane, and internally by the ribs; in this space are found the axillary vessels and nerves. The Subclavius (costo-clavicularis) arises by a round tendon fi'om the cartilage and adjacent part of the first rib; it is inserted into the under surface of the clavicle as far as the costo-coracoid liga- ment. This muscle is concealed by the costo-coracoid membrane, an extension of the deep cervical fascia, by which it is invested. Relations.—By its upper surf ace with the clavicle. By the lower with the subclavian artery and vein and brachial plexus, which separate it from the first rib. In front with the pectoralis major, the costo-coracoid membrane being interposed. Actions.—The pectoralis major draws the arm against the thorax,LATERAL THORACIC REGION, 241 while its upper fibres assist the upper part of the trapezius in rais- ing the shoulder, as in supporting weights. The lower fibres depress the shoulder with the aid of the latissimus dorsi. Taking its fixed point from the shoulder, the pectoralis major assists the pectoralis minor, subclavius, and serratus magnus, in drawing up and expand- ing the chest. The pectoralis minor, in addition to this action, draws upon the coracoid process, and assists in rotating the scapula upon the chest. The subclavius draws the clavicle downwards and forwards, and thereby assists in steadying the shoulder. All the muscles of this group are agents in forced respiration, but are in- capable of acting until the shoulders are fixed. Lateral Thoracic Region. Serratus magnus. The Serratus magnus (serratus, indented like the edge of a saAv ; costo-scapularis) broad, thin and trapezoid in shape, arises by nine fleshy serrations from the eight upper ribs, two of the serrations being attached to the second rib, and extends backwards upon the side of the chest, to be inserted into the whole length of the base of the scapula upon its anterior aspect. In structure, the muscle is composed^ of three portions, a superior portion, formed by the serra- tions of the first two ribs, and inserted into the inner surface of the superior angle of the scapula; a middle portion, composed of the serrations connected with the third and fourth ribs, and inserted into the greater part of the posterior border; an inferior portion, con- sisting of'the last five serrations which indigitate with the obliquus externus and form a thick muscular fasciculus, which is inseii-ed into the scapula near its inferior angle. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the pectoralis major and minor, subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and axillary vessels and nerves. By its deep surface with the ribs and intercostal muscles, to which it is connected by loose cellular tissue. Actions.—The serratus magnus is the great external inspiratory muscle, raising the ribs when the shoulders are fixed, and thereby increasing the cavity of the chest. Acting upon the scapula it draws the shoulder forwards, as we see to be the case in diseased lungs, where the chest has l5ecome almost fixed from apprehension of the expanding action of the respiratory muscles. Anterior Scapular Region. Subscapularis. The Subscapularis arises from the -whole of the under surface of the scapula excepting the superior and inferior angles, and terminates RPOSTERIOR SCAPULAR REGION. 242 by a broad and tliick tendon, which is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus, and by muscular fibres into the surface of bone immediately below that process. In structure the subsca- pularis is composed of eight or ten fasciculi, four or five of which arise from one side of as many aponeurotic processes attached to the ridges of the venter of the scapula; and four or five proceed from the other side of the aponeurotic processes and from the surface of bone intervening between them. Its tendon forms part of the capsule of the joint, glides over a large bursa which separates it from the base of the coracoid process, and is lined by a prolongation of the synovial membrane of the articulatiom Relations.—By its anterior surface with the serratus magnus, coraco-brachialis, and axillary vessels and nerves. By its posterior surface wdth the scapula, and shoulder-joint. Action.—It rotates the head of the humerus inwards, and is a powerful defence to the joint. When the arm is raised, it draws the humerus downwards. Posterior Scapular Region. Supra-spinatus, Teres minor, Infra-spinatus, Teres major. The Supra-spinatus muscle {supra, above; spina, the spine) arises from the supraspinous fossa, the spine of the scapula and proper investing fascia; and is inserted into the uppermost de- pression on the greater tuberosity of the humerus ; the tendon being united near its attachment with that of the infra-spinatus. The tendon cannot be seen until the acromion process is removed. Relations.—By its up/per surface with the trapezius, clavicle, acromion, and coraco-acromial ligament. From the trapezius it is separated by a strong fascia. By its lower surface with the supra- spinous fossa, suprascapular vessels and nerve, omo-hyoid muscle, and upper part of the shoulder-joint, forming part of the capsular ligament. The Infra-spinatus {infra, beneath; spina, the spine) is covered in by a layer of tendinous fascia, which must be removed before the fibres of the muscle can be seen, the deltoid muscle having been pre- viously turned down from its scapular origin. It arises from the whole of the infraspinous fossa, excepting a small portion near the neck of the bone, from the spine of the scapula, and from the invest- ing fascia; it is inserted into the middle depression upon the greater tuberosity of the humerus; its tendon being blended with that of the supraspinatus above and teres minor below. Relations.—By its posterior surface with the deltoid, latissimus dorsi, trapezius and integument. By its anterior surface with the infraspinous fossa, suprascapular and dorsal scapular vessels, andTERES MINOR.—TERES MAJOR. 243 shoulder-joint; its tendon being lined by a prolongation from the synovial membrane. By its upper border it is in relation with the spine of the scapula ; and by the lower with the teres major and minor, being closely united with the latter. The Teres minor {teres, round) arises from the posterior surface of the lower border of the scapula for about the middle third of its extent; it is closely connected ^ith the lower border of the pre- ceding muscle, and is inserted into the inferior depression of the greater tuberosity of the humerus. The tendons of the three preceding muscles, with that of the subscapularis, are in immediate contact with the shoulder-joint, and form part of its ligamentous capsule, thereby preserving the solidity of the articulation. They are therefore the structures most frequently ruptured in dislocation of the head of the humerus. Relations.—By its posterior mrfciice with the deltoid, latissimus dorsi, and integument. By its anterior surface with the inferior border, and part of the dorsum of the scapula, the dorsalis scapulae vessels, scapular head of the triceps, and shoulder-joint. By its upper border with the infra-spinatus; and by the lotoer with the latissimus dorsi, teres major, and long head of the triceps. The Teres major muscle arises from the dorsal surface of the inferior angle of the scapula, and from its inferior border ; it is inserted conjointly with the tendon of the latissimus dorsi into the posterior bicipital ridge of the humerus. At its origin this muscle is covered by the latissimus dorsi, but the latter shortly afterwards curves around its lower border and becomes placed in front; the two tendons, at their insertion one lying behind the other are separated by a bursa. Relations.—By its posterior surface with the latissimus dorsi, sca- pular head of the triceps and integument. By its anterior surface with the subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, coraco-brachialis, short head of the biceps, axillary vessels, and branches of the brachial plexus. By its upper border it is in relation with the teres minor, from which it is separated by the scapular head of the triceps ; and by the lower it forms with the latissimus dorsi the lower and posterior border of the axilla. A large triangular space exists between the two teres muscles, which is divided into two minor spaces by the long head of the triceps. Actions.—The supra-spinatus raises the arm from the side; but only feebly, from the disadvantageous direction of its force. The infra-spinatus and teres minor are rotators of the head of the humerus outwards. The most important use of these three muscles is the protection of the joint, and defence against displacement of the head of the humerus, in which action they co-operate with the sub- scapularis. The teres major combines, with the latissimus dorsi, in rotating the arm inwards, and at the same time carrying it towards the side, and somewhat backwards. R 2ACROMIAL REGION. 244 Acromial Region. Deltoideus, The Deltoideus (A, delta; dSoQ, resemblance; attollens hnmeri; sub-acromio-humeralis) is the large triangular muscle which forms the convexity of the shoulder; it arises from the outer third of the clavicle, from the acromion process, and from the whole leng-th of the spine of the scapula. The fibres from this broad origin con- verge to the middle of the outer side of the humerus, where they are inserted into a rough triangular elevation. In structure the deltoideus is composed of seven fasciculi, four of which are fleshy above and tendinous below; and three tendinous above and fleshy below. To bring the muscles beneath it into view, it must be cut away from its origin, and turned down; in so doing, a large bursa -will be seen between the under surface of the muscle and the head of the humerus. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the brachial fascia, a few fibres of the platysma myoides, the superficial fascia, and integu- ment. By its deep surface with the shoulder-joint [from which it is separated by a thin tendinous fascia and by a synovial bursa], with the coraco-acromial ligament, coracoid process, pectoralis minor, coraco-brachialis, both heads of the biceps, tendon of the pectoralis major, tendon of the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, teres miaor, teres major, scapular and external head of the triceps, circumflex vessels anterior and posterior, and humerus. By its anterior border with the external border of the pectoralis major, from which it is sepa- rated by a cellular interspace, lodging the cephalic vein and descend- ing branch of the thoracico-acromiaHs artery. Its posterior border is thin and tendinous above, where it is connected with the aponeu- rotic covering of the infra-spinatus muscle, and thick below. Actions.—The deltoid is the elevator muscle of the arm in a direct line, and, by means of its extensive origin, it can carry the arm forwards or backwards so as to range with the hand a con- siderable segment of a large circle. The arm, raised by the deltoid, is a good illustration of a lever of the third power, so common in the animal machine, by which velocity is gained at the expense of power. In this lever, the weight (hand) is at one extremity, the fulcrum (glenoid cavity) at the opposite end, and the power (insertion of the muscle) between the two, but nearer the fulcrum than the weight. Anterior Humeral Region. Coraco-brachialis, Biceps brachii, Brachialis anticus. Dissection.—These muscles are exposed, on the removal of the integument and fascia from tlie anterior half of the upper arm, and the clearing away of the cellular tissue.ANTERIOR HUMERAL REGION. 245 Fig. 114. The C jRACo-BRACHiALis, a name composed of its points of origin " and insertion, arises from tlie apex of the coracoid process in common with the short head of the biceps; and is inserted into a rough line on the inner side of the middle of the humerus. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the deltoid and pectoralis major. By its posterior surface with the shoulder-joint, humerus, subscapularis, teres major, latissi- mus dorsi, short head of the triceps, and anterior circumflex vessels. By its internal border with the axillary and brachial vessels and nerves, particularly with the me- dian and musculo-cutaneous nerve, by the latter of which it is pierced. By the external border with the short head of the biceps and bra- chialis anticus. The Biceps brachii (bis—Kt<pa- \ai, two heads; flexor radii) arises by two tendons, one, the short head, from the coracoid process in common with the coraco-brachialis; the other, the long head, from the upper part of the glenoid cavity, where it is continuous with the glenoid ligament. The muscle is inserted by a rounded tendon into the back part of the tubercle of the radius. The long head, a long slender tendon, passes through the capsular ligament of the shoulder- joint enclosed in a sheath of the synovial membrane; after leaving the cavity of the joint, it is lodged in the deep groove that separates the two tuberosities of the hume- rus, the bicipital groove. A small synovial bursa is interposed be- tween the tendon of insertion, and the tubercle of the radius. At the bend of the elbow, the tendon of the biceps gives off from its inner side a tendinous band, which * Muscles of the anterior aspect of the upper arm. 1. Coracoid process of the scapula. 2.

Relations.—By its anterior surface with the deltoid, pectoralis major, superficial and deep fascia, and integument. By its posterior surface the short head rests on the subscapularis, from which it is separated by a bursa. In the rest of its extent the muscle is in relation with the humerus, teres major, latissimus dorsi, and brachialis anticus ; from the latter it is separated by the musculo- cutaneous nerve. By its inner border with the coraco-brachialis, brachial artery and veins, and median nerve; the brachial vessels crossing its tendon at the bend of the elbow. By its outer border with the deltoid and supinator longus. The Brachialis anticus (humero-cubitalis) is a broad muscle covering the whole of the anterior surface of the lower part of the hiimerus; it arises by two fleshy serrations which embrace the in- sertion of the deltoid, from the anterior surface of the humerus, and from the inner intermuscular septum. Its fibres converge to be inserted into the coronoid process of the ulna, between two pro- cesses of the flexor digitorum profundus. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the biceps, musculo- cutaneous nerve, brachial artery and veins, and median nerve. By its posterior swrface with the humerus, anterior ligament of the elbow-joint, and intermuscular aponeurosis. The latter separates it from the triceps. By its external border with the supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior, musculo-spiral nerve, and recurrent radial artery. By its internal border with the intermuscular aponeurosis (which separates it from the triceps and ulnar nerve), and with the pronator radii teres. Actions.—The coraco-brachialis draws the humerus inwards, and assists in flexing it upon the scapula. The biceps and brachialis anticus are flexors of the forearm, and the former a supinator. The brachialis anticus is a powerful protector of the elbow-joint. Postenor Humeral Region. Triceps brachii. Dissection.—Remove the integument and fascia from the posterior aspect of the upper arm. The Triceps brachii {rptiQ Kt(pa\ai, three heads ; triceps ex- tensor crubiti) arises by three heads : external, middle, and internal. The external head (anconaeus externus) proceeds from the whole length of the external and posterior aspect of the humerus, fi-om the insertion of the teres minor at the greater tuberosity to the ex- ternal condyle, and also from the external intermuscular septum. The internal head (anconaeus internus) arises from the inner and posterior aspect of the humerus, from the insertion of the teres major to the internal condyle, and from the internal intermuscular247 TRICEPS BRACHII. septum. The middle or long head (anconseus longus) arises from the lower part of the head and adjoining part of the border of the scapula, to the extent of about an inch. The three heads, passing downwards in different directions, unite to form a broad muscle, which is inserted into the olecranon process of the ulna, and sends an expansion to the deep fascia of the forearm. A small bursa is situated between the tendon of the muscle and the upper part of the Fig. 115.* olecranon. The scapular head of the triceps passes between the teres minor and major, and divides the tri- angular space between those two muscles into two smaller spaces, one of which is triangular, the other quadrangular. The trian- gular space is bounded by the teres minor, teres major, and scapular head of the triceps; it gives pas- sage to the dorsalis scapulae artery and veins. The quadrangular space is bounded on three sides by the three preceding muscles, and on the fourth by the humerus. Through this space pass the posterior cir- cumflex artery and veins, and cir- cumflex nerve. Beneath the lower part of the tri- ceps are two small fasciculi arising from the humerus, and descending one on either side of the fossa of the olecranon to be inserted into the capsule of the elbow-joint. These have been named suh-anco- neus, they are analogous to the sub-crureus. Relations. —By its posterior sur- face with the deep and superficial fascia and integument. By its an- terior surface with the superior profunda artery, musculo-spiral nerve, humerus, intermuscular aponeurosis which separates it from the brachialis anticus, and elbow-joint.

Actions.—The triceps brachii is an extensor of the forearm. Anterior Brachial Region. Superficial layer. Pronator radii teres, Flexor carpi radialis, Palmaris longns, Flexor sublimis digitorum, Flexor carpi ulnaris. Dissection.—These muscles are brought into view by making an incision through the integument along the middle line of the fore- arm, crossing each extremity by a transverse incision, and turning aside the flaps. The superficial and deep fascia are then to be removed. The Pronator radii teres arises by two heads: one from the inner condyle of the humerus, fascia of the forearm, and intermus- cular septum; the other from the coronoid process of the ulna; the median nerve passing between them. Its tendon is flat, and is inserted into the middle third of the obKque ridge of the radius. The two heads of this muscle are best examined by cutting through that which arises from the inner condyle, and turning it aside. The second head will then be seen with the median nerve lying across it. Relaticms.—By its anterior surface with the deep fascia of the forearm, the supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, radial artery and veins, and radial nerve. By its posterior surface with the brachialis anticus, flexor sublimis digitorum, ulnar artery and veins, and the median nerve after it has passed between the two heads of the muscle. By its upper border it forms the inner boundary of the triangular space, in which the termination of the brachial artery is situated. By its loioer border it is in relation with the flexor carpi radialis. The Flexor carpi radialis arises from the inner condyle, deep fascia and intermuscular septa. Its tendon passes through a groove in the trapezium bone, to be inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. Relations.—By its anterior smface with the deep fascia of the foreaiin, and at the wrist with the tendinous canal through which its tendon passes. By its posterior surface with the flexor sublimis digitorum, flexor longus pollicis, wrist-joint, and groove in the tra- pezium bone. By its outer border with the pronator radii teres, radial artery and veins. By its inner border mth the palmaris longus. The tendon is surrounded by synovial membrane where it plays through the tendinous canal of the wrist.249 PLEXOR SUBLIMIS DIGITORUM. The Palmaris lonuus is a small muscle which arises from the condyle, deep fascia, and mner intermuscular septa. Its tendon pierces the deep fascia and crosses the annular ligament to be inserted into the palmar fascia. Relations.—By its anterior sur- face with the deep fascia of the forearm. By the posterior surface with the flexor sublimis digitorum ; to the external side with the flexor carpi radialis; and to the internal side with the flexor carpi ulnaris. Cut the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus from their origins, in order to obtain a good view of the whole extent of origin of the flexor sublimis digitorum. The Flexor sublimis digi- torum (perforatus) arises from the inner condyle, intermuscular septa, internal lateral ligament, coronoid process of'the ulna, and oblique line of the radius. The median nerve and ulnar artery pass between its origins. It divides into four ten- dons, which pass beneath the an- nular ligament, and are inserted into the base of the second pha- langes of the fingers, splitting at their termination to give passage to the tendons of the deep flexor; hence its designation, perforatus. tn the thecse of the fingers several small tendinous fasciculi are gene- rally found, which pass between the phalanges and the edges of the tendons; these have been termed the vincula accessoria.

By its posterior surface with the flexor profundus digitorum, flexor longns pollicis, ulnar artery, veins, and nerve, and median nerve. This muscle frequently sends a fasciculus to the flexor longus pollicis or flexor profundus. In the hand : its tendons, after passing beneath the annular ligament, are in relation superficially with the superficial palmar arch, and palmar fascia; and deeply with the tendons of the deep flexor and lumbricales. The Flexor carpi ulnaris arises by two heads, one from the inner condyle and intermuscular septa, the other from the olecranon and by means of a strong aponeurosis from two-thirds of the inner border of the ulna. Its tendon is inserted into the pisiform bone and base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger.

The ulnar nerve, and the poste- rior ulnar recurrent artery, pass between its two heads of origin. Deep layer. Flexor profundus digitorum. Flexor longus pollicis. Pronator quadratus. Dissection.—This group is brought into view by removing the flexor sublimis, and drawing aside the pronator radii teres. The Flexor profundus digitorum (perforans) arises from the upper two-thirds of the ulna, its anterior and inner surface and pos- terior border, from the inner side of the olecranon, where it is connected with the aponeurotic expansion of the flexor carpi ulnaris and from the ulnar half of the interosseous membrane. At the middle of the forearm it divides into four tendons which pass beneath the annular ligament, and on the fingers, between the two slips of the tendons of the flexor sublimis, to be inserted into the base of the last phalanges. In the groove of the cai-pus the tendons are enclosed in a synovial membrane and the three outer tendons communicate with each other by means of small slips, the tendon of the index finger remaining distinct. In the hand, the tendons give origin to the lumbricales muscles, and on the second phalanges they are retained in position by two little tendinous slips, the vincula accessoria.

By its radial border with the flexor longus pollicis, the anterior interosseous artery and nerve being interposed. By its ulnar border with the flexor carpi ulnaris. In the hand : its tendons are in relation su- perficially with the tendons of the superficial flexor; and deeply with the interossei, adductor pollicis, and deep palmar arch. The Flexor longus pollicis aHses from the anterior surface of the ra- dius for two-thirds of its extent, and from one-half of the interosseous mem- brane. Its tendon passes beneath the annular ligament to be inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—By its anterior stirface with the flexor sublimis digitorum, flexor carpi radialis, supinator longus, and radial artery and veins. By its posterior surface with the radius, interosseous membrane, pronator qua- dratus, and wrist-joint. By its ulnar border, it is separated from the flexor profundus digitorum by the anterior interosseous artery and nerve. In the hand : after passing beneath the annular ligament, it is lodged in the interspace between the two portions of the flexor brevis pollicis, and after- wards in the tendinous theca of the phalanx. If the tendons of the last two muscles be drawn aside or divided, the third muscle of this group will be brought into view, lying across the lower part of the two bones. The Pronator quadratus (cubito- radialis) arises from the anterior and inner side of the ulna; and is inserted ' 1.

The Supinator longus (brachio-radialis) is placed along the radial border of the forearm. It arises from the external condyloid ridge of the humerus, nearly as high as the insertion of the deltoid, and from the intermuscular septum : it is inserted into the base of the styloid process of the radius. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor primi internodii pollicis, and deep fascia of the forearm. By its deep surface with the brachialis anticus, extensor carpi radialis longior, tendon of the biceps, supinator brevis, pronator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis, flexor sublimis digitorum, flexor longus pollicis, pronator quadratus, radius, mus- culo-spiral nerve, radial and posterior interosseous nerve, and radial artery and veins. This muscle must be divided through the middle, and the two ends turned aside to expose the next muscle. The Extensor carpi radialis longior arises from the externalEXTENSOR CARPI RABIALIS BREVIOR. 253 Fig. 118. condyloid ridge, below the preceding, and from the intermuscular septum. Its tendon passes through a groove in the radius immediately behind the styloid process, to be imerted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. Relations.—By its superficial sur- face with the supinator longus, ex- tensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, exten- sor primi intemodii pollicis, extensor secundi intemodii pollicis, radial nerve, fascia of the forearm, and posterior annular ligament. By its deep surface with the brachialis an- ticus, extensor carpi radialis brevior, radius, and wrist-joint. The Extensor carpi radialis BREVIOR is seen by drawing aside the former muscle. It arises from the external condyle of the humerus and intermuscular septa, and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. Its tendon is lodged in the same groove on the radius with that of the extensor carpi radialis longior.

At the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation each tendon becomes narrow and thick, and sends a thin fasciculus upon each side of the joint. It then spreads out, and receiving the tendon of the lumbricalis and some tendinous fasciculi from the interossei, forms a broad aponeurosis, which covers the whole poste- rior aspect of the finger. At the first phalangeal joint the aponeu- rosis divides into three slips. The middle slip is inserted into the base of the second phalanx, and the two lateral portions are con- tinued onwards on each side of the joint, to be inserted into the last. Little oblique tendinous slips connect the tendon of the ring with those of the middle and little finger as they cross the back of the hand. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the deep fascia of the forearm and hand, and posterior annular ligament. By its deep surface with the supinator brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor primi internodii, extensor secundi internodii, extensor indicis, posterior interosseous artery and nerve, wrist-joint, meta- carpal bones, interossei muscles, and phalanges. By its radial harder with the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevier. By the ulnar harder with the extensor minimi digiti, and extensor carpi ulnaris. The Extensor minimi diuiti (auriculaiis) is an oif-set from the extensor communis, with which it is connected by means of a ten- dinous slip. Passing down to the inferior extremity of the ulna it ti'averses a distinct fibrous sheath, and at the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation unites with the tendon derived from the common extensor. The common tendon then spreads out into a broad expansion which divides into three slips to be inserted as in the other fingers into the last two phalanges. It is to this muscle that tlie little finger owes its power of separate extension; and from being called into action when the point of the finger is introduced into the meatus of the ear, for the purpose of removing unpleasant sensations or producing titillation, the muscle was called by the old writers " auricularis." The Extensor carpi ulnaris arises from the external condyle by the common tendon, from the border of the ulna, and from the deep fascia. Its tendon passes through the posterior groove in the lower extremity of the ulna, to be inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. Relations.—By its superficial s-mface with the deep fascia of the forearm, and posterior annular ligament. By its deep surface with the supinator brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensoi- secundi internodii, extensor indicis, ulna, and wrist-joint. By its radial harder it is in relation with the extensor communis digitorum and extensor minimi digiti, and by the idnar harder with the anconeus.255 EXTENSOR PRIMI INTERNODII POLLIC'IS. The Anconeus (anconseus parvus, vel quartus) is a small trian- gular muscle, having the appearance of being a continuation of the triceps ; it arises from the outer condyle, and is inserted into the olecranon and triangular surface of the upper extremity of the ulna.

Supinator brevis, Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, Extensor primi internodii pollicis, Extensor secundi internodii pollicis, Extensor indicis. Dissection.—The muscles of the superficial layer should be re- moved in order to bring the deep group completely into view. The Supinator brevis cannot be seen in its entire extent, until the radial extensors of the carpus are divided from their origin. It arises from the external condyle, from the external lateral and orbicular ligament, and from the ulna, and winds around the upper part of the radius, to be inserted into the upper third of its oblique line. The posterior interosseous artery and nerve are seen perfo- rating the lower border of this muscle. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the pronator radii teres, supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, extensor communis digitorum, extensor carpi ulnaris, anconeus, radial artery and veins, musculo-spiral nerve, radial and posterior interosseous nerve. By its deep surface with the elbow-joint and ligaments, interosseous membrane, and radius. The Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis (abductor pollicis longus) is placed immediately below the supinator brevis. It arises from the ulna, interosseous membrane and radius, and is inserted^ as its name implies, into the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. Its tendon passes through the groove immediately in front of the styloid process of the radius. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor minimi digiti, extensor communis digitorum, fascia of the forearm and annular ligament. By its deep surface with the ulna, interosseous membrane, radius, tendons of the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior and supinator longus, and at the wrist with the radial artery. By its upper border with the edge of the supinator brevis. By its lower border with the extensor secundi and primi internodii. The muscle is crossed by branches of the posterior interosseous artery and nerve. The Extensor primi internodii pollicis (extensor pollicis brevis vel minor) the smallest of the muscles in this layer, arisesPOSTERIOR BRACHIAL REGION. 256 from the interosseous membrane and radius, and passes through the same groove with the extensor ossis metacarpi, to be inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—The same as those of the preceding muscle, with the exception of the extensor carpi ul- naris. The muscle accompanies the extensor ossis metacarpi. The Extensor sbcundi internodii POLLicis (extensor pollicis longus vel major) arises from the ulna, and in- terosseous membrane. Its tendon passes through a distinct groove in the radius, and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—By its external surface with the same relations as the ex- tensor ossis metacarpi. By its deep surface with the ulna, interosseous membrane, radius, wrist-joint, radial artery, and metacarpal bone of the thumb. The muscle is placed between the extensor primi internodii and ex- tensor indicis. The Extensor indicis (indicator) arises from the ulna, as high up as the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, and inferiorly from the interosseous membrane. Its tendon passes be- neath the annular ligament to be inserted into the aponeurosis formed by the common extensor tendon of the index finger. Relations.—The same as those of the preceding muscle, with the excep- tion of the hand, where the tendon rests upon the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger and second interosseous muscle, and has no relation with the radial artery. The tendons of the extensors, as of the flexor muscles of the forearm, are provided with synovial bursa as they * Deep layer of muscles of the posterior aspect of the forearm. 1. The humerus. 2.

Actions.—The anconeus is associated in its action with the triceps extensor cubiti: it assists in extending the forearm upon the arm. The supinator longus and brevis effect the supination of the forearm, and antagonize the two pronators. The extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior and extensor carpi ulnaris, extend the wrist in opposition to the two flexors of the carpus. The extensor communis digitorum restores the fingers to the straight position after they have been flexed by the two flexors, sublimis and pro- fundus. The extensor ossis metacarpi, primi internodii, and secundi internodii pollicis, are the special extensors of the thumb, and serve to balance the actions of the flexor ossis metacarpi, flexor brevis, and flexor longus pollicis. The extensor indicis gives the character of extension to the index finger, and is therefore named "indicator," and the extensor minimi digiti supplies that finger with the power of exerting a distinct extension. MUSCLES OE THE HAND. Radial or Thenar Region. Abductor pollicis, Flexor ossis metacarpi (opponens), , Flexor brevis pollicis, ' Adductor pollicis. Dissection.—The hand is best dissected by making an incision along the middle of the palm, from the wrist to the base of the middle finger, and crossing it at each extremity by a transverse incision, then turning aside the flaps of integument. For exposing the muscles of the radial region, the removal of the integument and fascia on the radial side will be sufficient. The Abductor pollicis (brevis) is a small, thin muscle, which arises from the trapezium bone and annular ligament. It is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—-By its superficial surface with the external portion of the palmar fascia. By its c^eep surface with the flexor ossis meta- carpi. On its inner side it is separated by a narrow cellular inter- space from the flexor brevis pollicis. This muscle must be divided from its origin, and turned aside, in order to see the next. The Flexor ossis metacarpi (opponens pollicis) amses from the trapezium and annular ligament, and is inserted into the whole length of the metacarpal bone. Relations.—its superficial surface with the abductor pollicis. By its deep surface with the trapezo-metacarpal articulation and metacarpal bone. Internally with the flexor brevis pollicis. The flexor ossis metacarpi may now be divided from its origin and turned aside, in order to show the next muscle. sMUSCLES OP THE HAND. 258 The Flexok brevis pollicis consists of two portions, between which lies the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. The external portion arises' from the trapezium and annular ligament; the internal portion from the trapezoides and os magnum. They are both inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, having a sesamoid bone in each of their tendons to protect the joint.

Ulnar or Hypothenar Region. Palmaris brevis, Abductor minimi digiti. Flexor brevis minimi digiti, Adductor ossis metacarpi. Dissection.—Turn aside the ulnar flap of integument from the palm of the hand; in doing this, a small subcutaneous muscle, the palmaris brevis, will be exposed. After examining this muscle, re- move it with the deep fascia, in order to bring into view the muscles of the little finger. The Palmaris brevis is a thin plane of muscular fibres about an inch in width, which arises from the annular ligament and palmar fascia, and passes transversely inwards to be inserted into the in- tegument of the inner border of the hand. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the fat and integument of the ball of the little finger. By its deep surface with the ulnar portion of the palmar fascia, which separates it from the ulnar artery, veins and nerve, and from the muscles of the inner border of the hand. The Abductor minimi digiti is a small tapering muscle which arises from the pisiform bone, where it is continuous with the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the little finger, and the expansion of the extensor tendon. Relations.—superficial surface with the internal portion of the deep fascia and palmaris brevis; by its deep surfa.cc with the adductor ossis metacarpi and metacarpal bone.

By its deep surface with the interossei muscles of the last metacarpal space, metacarpal bone, and flexor tendons of the little finger. Palmar Region. Lumbricales, Interossei palmares, Interossei dorsales. The Lumbricales, four in number, are accessories to the deep flexor muscle. They arise from the tendons of the deep flexor; the first and second from the palmar side, the third from the ulnar, the fourth from the radial side; and are inserted into the aponeurotic expansion of the extensor tendons on the radial side of the fingers. The third, or that of the tendon of the ring finger, sometimes bifur- cates, at other times it is inserted wholly into the extensor tendon of the middle finger. Relations.—In the palm of the hand with the flexor tendons; at their insertion with the tendons of the interossei and the metacarpo- phalangeal articulations. The Palmar interossei, three in number, are placed upon the metacarpal bones, rather than between them. They arise from the base of the metacarpal bone of one finger, and are inserted into the base of the first phalanx and aponeurotic expansion of the extensor tendon of the same finger. The first belongs to the index finger; the second, to the ring finger; the third to the little finger; the middle finger being omitted. Relations.—By their palmar surface with the flexor tendons and deep muscles in the palm of the hand. By their dorsal surface with the dorsal interossei. On one side with the metacarpal bone, on the other with the corresponding dorsal interosseous muscle. Dorsal interossei.—On turning to the dorsum of the hand, the four dorsal interossei (bicipites) are seen in the four spaces between the metacarpal bones. They are bipenniform muscles, and arise by two heads, from adjoining sides of the bases of the metacarpal bones. They are inserted into the base of the first phalanges, and into the aponeurosis of the extensor tendons.261 DORSAL INTEROSSEI. The first is inserted into the index finger, and from its use is called abductor indicis; the second and third are inserted into the middle finger, compensating its exclusion from the palmar group; the fourth is attached to the ring finger; so that each finger is provided with two interossei, with the exception of the little finger, as may be shown by means of a table, thus ;— TIM \ one dorsal (abductor indicis), Index nnqer \ ^ [ one palmar. Middle finger^ two dorsal. - ^ - T,- ji \ one dorsal, ^ ^ ( one palmar. Little finger, remaining palmar. Relations.—By their dorsal surface with a thin aponeurosis which separates them from the tendons on the dorsum of the hand. By their palmar surface with the muscles and tendons in the palm of the hand. By one side with the metacarpal bone; by the other with the corresponding palmar interosseous. The abductor indicis is in relation by its palmar surface, with the adductor pollicis and flexor brevis pollicis. The radial artery passes into the palm of the hand between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (ab- ductor iadicis); and the perforating branches of the deep palmar arch, between the heads of the other dorsal interossei. Actions.—The actions of the muscles of the hand are expressed in their names. Those of the radial region belong to the thumb, and provide for three of its movements, abduction, adduction, and flexion. The ulnar group, in like manner, are subservient to the same motions of the little finger, and the interossei are abductors and adductors of the several fingers. The lumbricales are accessory in their actions to the deep flexors; they were called by the earlier anatomists fidicinii, i.e. fiddlers' muscles, from an idea that they might effect the fractional movements by which the performer is enabled to produce the various notes on that instrument. In relation to the axis of the hand, the four dorsal interossei are adductors, and the three palmar adductors. It wiR therefore be seen that each finger is provided with its proper adductor and ab- ductor, two flexors, and (with the exception of the middle and ring finger) two extensors. The thumb has moreover a flexor and ex- tensor of the metacarpal bone; and the little finger a flexor of the metacarpal bone (opponens) without an extensor.262 MUSCLES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The muscles of the lower extremity may be arranged into groups corresponding with the regions of the hip, thigh, leg, and foot, as in the following table :— HIP.

Dissection.—The subject being turned on its face, and a block placed beneath the pubes to support the pelvis, the student com- mences the dissection of this region, by carrying an incision from the apex of the coccyx along the crest of the ilium to its anterior superior spinous process; or vice versa, if he be on the left side. He then makes an incision from the posterior fifth of the crest of the ilium, to the apex of the trochanter major, this marks the upper border of the gluteus maximus; and a third incision from the apex of the, coccyx along the fleshy margin of the lower border of the gluteus maximus, to the outer side of the thigh, about four inches below the apex of the trochanter major. He then reflects the in- tegument, superficial fascia, and deep fascia, which latter is very thin over this muscle, from the gluteus maximus, following rigidly the course of its fibres; and having exposed the muscle in its entire extent, he dissects the integument and superficial fascia from off the deep fascia which binds down the gluteus medius, the other portion of this region. Grluteus maximus. Obturator internus, Grluteus medius, Glemellus inferior, Grluteus minimus, Obturator externus, Pyriformis, Quadratus femoris. Gemellus superior. The GtLuteus maximus {yXovTog, nates ; sacro-femoralis) is the thick, fleshy mass of muscle, of a quadrangular shape, which forms the convexity of the nates. In structure, it is coarse, being made up of large fibres, which are collected into fasciculi, and these again into distinct muscular masses, separated by deep cellular furrows. It arises from the posterior fifth of the crest of the ilium, from the posterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx, and from the great sacro- ischiatic ligament. It passes obliquely outwards and downwards, to be inserted into the rough line leading from the trochanter major to the linea aspera, and is continuous by means of its tendon with the fascia lata covering the outer side of the thigh. Several bursse are situated between this muscle and subjacent parts: one upon theMUSCLES OP THE GLUTEAL REGION. 264 tuberosity of the iscliium, one between its tendon and tbe trochanter major, and one between it and the tendon of the vastus externus.

By its upper border it overlaps the gluteus medius; and by the lovjer border forms the lower margin of the nates. The gluteus maximus must be turned down from its origin, in order to bring the next muscles into view. The GrLUTEUS MEDIUS is placed in front of, rather than beneath Fig. 121.* * Deep muscles of the gluteal region. 1. Hium. 2. Sacrum. 3. Posterior sacroiliac Hgaments. 4. Tuberosity of the ischium. 5.

It arises from the outer lip of the crest of the ilium for four-fifths of its length, from the sur- face of bone between that border and the superior curved line of the dorsum ilii, and from the dense fascia above mentioned. Its fibres converge to the outer part of the trochanter major, into which its tendon is inserted. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the tensor vagina fe- moris, gluteus maximus, and its own proper fascia. By its deej) surface with the gluteus minimus and gluteal vessels and nerves. By its lower border with the pyriformis muscle. A bursa is interposed between its tendon and the upper part of the trochanter major. This muscle should now be removed from its origin and turned down, so as to expose the next, which is situated beneath it. The GrLUTEUS minimus is a radiated muscle arising from the surface of the dorsum ilii, between the superior and inferior curved line; its fibres converge to the anterior border of the trochanter major, into which it is inserted by means of a rounded tendon. There is no distinct separation between the gluteus medius and minimus anteriorly. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the gluteus medius, and gluteal vessels. By its deep surface with the ilium, long tendon iof the rectus femoris, and capsule of the hip-joint. A bursa is interposed between its tendon and the trochanter. The Pyriformis (pyrum, a pear, i.e. pear-shaped; iliacus extemus) arises from the anterior surface of the sacrum, by three little slips interposed between the anterior sacral foramina from the first to the fourth, and from the adjoining surface of the ilium. It passes out of the pelvis through the great sacroischiatic foramen, and is in- serted by a rounded tendon into the posterior border of the tro- chanter major. Relations.—By its superficial or external surface with the sacrum and gluteus maximus. By its deep or pelvic surface with the rectum, sacral plexus of nerves, branches of the internal iliac artery, great sacroischiatic notch, and capsule of the hip-joint. By its upper border with the gluteus medius and gluteal vessels and nerves. By its lower border with the gemellus superior, ischiatio vessels and nerves, and internal pudic vessels and nerve. The Gemellus superior (gemellus, double, twin) is a small slip of muscle situated immediately below the pyriformis, it arises from the spine of the ischium, and is inserted into the upper border of the tendon of the obturator internus, and into the digital fossa of the trochanter major. The gemellus superior is not unfrequently wanting. Relations.—'By its superficial surface with the gluteus maximus, ischiatic vessels and nerves, and internal pudic vessels and nerve. By its deep surface with the pelvis and capsule of the hip-joint. The Obturator internus arises from the inner surface of the266 MUSCLES OP THE GLUTEAL REGION. anterior wall of the pelvis, being attached to the margin of bone around the obturator foramen and to the obturator membrane. It passes out of the pelvis through the lesser sacroischiatic foramen, and is inserted by a flattened tendon into the digital fossa of the trochanter major. The lesser sacroischiatic notch, over which this muscle plays as through a pulley, is faced with cartilage, and provided with a synovial bursa to facilitate its movements. The tendon of the obturator is supported on each side by the gemelli muscles (hence their names), which are inserted into the sides of its tendon, and appear to be auxiliaries or superadded portions, external origins in fact of the obturator internus. Relations.—By its superficial or posterior surface with the internal pudic vessels and nerve, the obturator fascia, which sepa- rates it from the levator ani and viscera of the pelvis, the sacro- ischiatic ligaments, gluteus maximus, and ischiatic vessels and nerves.

The Gemellus inferior arises from the posterior point of the tuberosity of the ischium, and is inserted into the lower border of the tendon of the obturator internus, and into the digital fossa of the trochanter major. Relations. —By its superficial surface with the gluteus maximus, and ischiatic vessels and nerves. By its deep surface with the external surface of the pelvis, and capsule of the hip-joint. By its upper border with the tendon of the obturator internus. By its loioer border with the tendon of the obturator externus and qua- dratus femoris. In this region the tendon only of the obturator externus can be seen; it is situated deeply between the gemellus inferior and upper border of the quadratus femoris. To expose the muscle fully, it is necessary to dissect it on the anterior part of the thigh, after the removal of the pectineus, adductor longus and adductor brevis. The Obturator externus muscle (obturare, to stop up) arises from the obturator membrane and from the surface of the bone immediately surrounding it anteriorly, viz. from the ramus of the pubes and ischium : its tendon passes behind the neck of the femur, to be inserted with the external rotator muscles, into the digital fossa of the trochanter major. Relations.—By its superficial or anterior surface with the tendon of the psoas and iliacus, pectineus, adductor brevis and magnus, obturator vessels and nerve.

The QuADRATUS PEMORis (square-sliaped) arises from the external border of the tuberosity of the ischium ; and is inserted into a rough line on the posterior border of the trochanter major, which is thence named linea quadrati. Relations.—posterior surface with the gluteus maximus, and ischiatic vessels and nerves. By its anterior surface with the tendon of the obturator externus and trochanter minor, a synovial bursa often separating it from the latter. By its upper border with the gemellus inferior ; and by the lower border with the adductor magnus. Actions.—The glutei muscles are abductors of the thigh, when they take their fixed point from the pelvis. Taking their fixed point from the thigh, they steady the pelvis on the head of the femur; this action is peculiarly obvious in standing on one leg : they assist also in carrying the leg forward, in progression. The gluteus minimus being attached to the anterior border of the trochanter major, rotates the limb slightly inwards. The gluteus medius and maximus, from their insertion into the posterior aspect of the bone, rotate the limb outwards ; the latter is, moreover, a tensor of the fascia of the thigh. The other muscles rotate the limb outwards, everting the knee and foot; hence they are named external rotators. ' Anterior Femoral Region. Tensor vaginge femoris, Vastus internus, Sartorius, Vastus externus, Rectus femoris, Crureus. Dissection.—Make an incision along the line of Poupart's liga- ment, from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium to the spine of the pubes ; and a second, from the middle of the preceding, down the inner side of the thigh, and across the inner condyle of the femur to the head of the tibia, where it may be bounded by a transverse incision. Turn back the integument from the whole of this region, and examine the superficial fascia; which is next to be removed in the same manner. After the deep fascia has been well considered, it is likewise to be removed, by dissecting it off in the course of the fibres of the muscles. As it might not be conve- nient to the junior student to expose so large a surface at once as ordered in this dissection, the vertical incision may be crossed by one or two transverse incisions, as may be deemed most proper. The Tensor vagina femoris (stretcher of the sheath of the thigh) is a short flat muscle, situated on the outer side of the hip. It arises from the crest of the ilium, near its anterior superior spinous process, and is inserted between two layers of the fascia lata at about one-fourth down the thigh. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the fascia lata and integument. By its deep surface with an internal layer of the268 ANTERIOR FEMORAL REGION. fascia lata, gluteus medius, rectus, and vastus extemus. By its imier harder near its origin with the sartorius. The Sartorius (tailor's muscle) is a long riband-like muscle, ansing from the anterior superior Fig. 122.* spinous process of the ilium, and from the notch immediately below that process ; it crosses obliquely the upper third of the thigh, de- scends behind the inner condyle of the femur, and is inserted by an aponeurotic expansion into the inner tuberosity of the tibia. This ex- pansion covers in the insertion of the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles. The inner border of the sartorius muscle is the guide to the operation for tying the femoral artery in the middle of its course; and the outer boundary of Scarpa's triangular space.

By its expanded insertion mth the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus, a synovial bursa being interposed. At the knee-joint its posterior border is in relation with the in- ternal saphenous vein. At the upper third of the thigh the sar- torius forms, with the lower border of the adductor longus, an isosceles triangle (Scarpa's triangular space), whereof the base corresponds with Poupart's ligament.

The Rectus pemoris (straight) is fusiform in its shape and bipen- niform in the disposition of its fibres. It arises by two round tendons, one from the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium, the other from the upper lip of the acetabulum; and is inserted by a broad and strong tendon into the upper border of the patella. It is more correct to consider the patella as a sesamoid bone, developed within the tendon of the rectus; and the ligamentum patellse as the continuation of the tendon to its insertion into the tubercle of the tibia. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the gluteus medius, psoas and iliacus, sartorius; and for the lower three-fourths of its extent, with the fascia lata. By its deep surface with the capsule of the hip-joint, external circumflex vessels, crureus, vastus internus and externus. The rectus must now be divided through its middle, and the two ends turned aside, to bring clearly into view the next muscles. The three next muscles are generally considered collectively under the name of triceps extensor cruris. Adopting this view, the muscle surrounds the whole of the femur, excepting the rough line (linea aspera), on its posterior aspect. Its division into three parts is not well delfined; the fleshy mass upon each side being distinguished by the names of vastus internus and externus, the middle portion by that of crureus. The Vastus externus (extensor cruris externus), narrow below and btoad above, arises from the base of the trochanter major, the outer surface of the femur, outer lip of the linea aspera, and inter- muscular fascia; it passes down to be inserted into the outer border of the patella, or rather by means of the ligamentum patella into the tubercle of the tibia conjointly with the rectus and two following muscles. Relations.—'Qj \i% superficial surface with the fascia lata, rectus, biceps, semi-membranosus, and gluteus maximus, a synovial bursa being interposed between it and the latter. By its dee'p surface with the crureus and femur. The Vastus internus (extensor cruris internus), broad below and na.rrow above, arises from the anterior intertrochanteric line, inner surface of the femur, inner lip of the linea aspera and intermuscular fascia, and is inserted into the inner border of the patella. By its mesial border it is blended with the crureus.

The Crureus (crus, the leg) arises from the anterior intertro- chanteric line and anterior surface of the femur to within two inches270 INTERNAL FEMORAL REGION. of the patella. It is continuous by its inner border with the vastus internus, and is inserted into the upper border of the patella; its tendon occupying its cutaneous aspect. When the crureus is divided from its insertion, a small muscle is seen upon the lower part of the femur; it generally consists of two fasciculi, external and internal, which are inserted into the pouch of synovial membrane that extends upwards from the knee-joint, be- hind the patella; and is named, from its situation, suh-crureus. It would seem to be intended to support the synovial membrane, Relations.—By its superficial surface with the external circum- flex vessels, rectus, vastus internus and externus. By its deep surface with the femur, sub-crureus, and synovial membrane of the knee-joint. Actions.—The tensor vaginae femoris renders the fascia lata tense, and slightly inverts the limb. The sartorius flexes the leg upon the thigh, and, continuing to act, the thigh upon the pelvis, at the same time carrying the leg across that of the opposite side, into the position in which tailors sit; hence its name. Taking its fixed point from below, it assists the extensor muscles in steadying the leg, for the support of the trunk. The other four muscles have been collectively named quadriceps extensor, from their similarity of action. They extend the leg upon the thigh, and obtain a great in- crease of power by their attachment to the patella, which acts as a fulcrum. Taking their fixed point from the tibia, they steady the femur upon the leg, and the rectus, being attached to the pelvis^^ serves to balance the trunk upon the lower extremity. Dissection.—These muscles are exposed by the removal of the inner flap of integument recommended in the dissection of the an- terior femoral region. The iliacus and psoas arising from within the abdomen can only be seen in their entire extent after the removal of the viscera from that cavity. The Iliacus internus is a flat radiated muscle. It arises from the fossa of the ilium, the internal lip of the crest, and anterior border of the bone; and after escaping beneath the crural arch and joining the tendon of the psoas, is inserted into the trochanter minor of the femur. A few fibres of this muscle are derived from the base of the sacrum, and others from the capsular ligament of the hip-joint. Theile, with several other anatomists, regards the iliacus internus and psoas magnus as a single muscle arising by two heads; and it Internal Femoral Region. Iliacus internus, Psoas magnus, Pectineus, Adductor longus, Adductor brevis. Adductor magnus, Gracilis.271 PSOAS MAGNUS.—PECTINEUS. is quite true that the former has no proper tendon, its muscular fibres being inserted into that of the psoas. He describes the combined muscle under the name oi flexor femoris. Relations.—BJ its anterior surface, within the pelvis, with the external cutaneous nerve, and iliac fascia, which latter separates the muscle from the peritoneum, on the right from the csecum, and on the left from the sigmoid flexure of the colon; externally to the pelvis, with the fascia lata, rectus, and sartorius. By its posterior surface with the iliac fossa, margin of the pelvis, and with the capsule of the hip-joint, a synovial bursa of large size being inter- posed. This bursa is sometimes continuous with the synovial mem- brane of the ilio-femoral articulation. By its inner border the iliacus is in relation with the psoas magnus and crural nerve. The Psoas magnus {xpoa, lumbus, a loin), situated by the side of the vertebral column in the loins, is a long fusiform muscle. It arises from the bodies and bases of the transverse processes of the last dorsal and all the lumbar vertebrae. It also takes its origin from the intervertebral substances, and from a series of tendinous arches attached to the vertebrae, and intended for the protection of the lumbar vessels and branches of the sympathetic nerve in their passage between the muscle and the bone. From this extensive origin the muscle passes along the margin of the brim of the pelvis, and beneath Poupart's ligament, to its insertion. The tendon of the psoas m9.gnus unites with that of the iliacus, and the conjoined tendon is' inserted into the posterior part of the trochanter minor, a bursa being interposed. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the ligamentum arcuatum internum of the diaphragm, the kidney, psoas parvus, genito-crural nerve, sympathetic nerve, psoas fascia, peritoneum and colon, and along its pelvic border with the common and external iliac artery and vein. By its posterior surface with the lumbar vertebrse, lumbar arteries, quadratus lumborum (from which latter it is sepa- rated by the anterior layer of the aponeurosis of the transversalis), and with the crural nerve, which near Poupart's ligament passes to its outer side. The lumbar plexus of nerves is situated in the substance of the posterior part of the muscle. In the thigh the muscle is in relation with the fascia lata in front; the border of the pelvis and hip-joint, from which it is separated by the synovial membrane, common to it and the preceding muscle, behind; with the crural nerve and iliacus muscle to the outer side; and with the femoral artery, by which it is slightly overlaid, to the inoier side. The Pectineus is a flat and quadrangular muscle; it arises from the pectineal line (pecten, a crest) of the os pubis, and from the surface of bone in front of that line. It is inserted into the line leading from the anterior intertrochanteric line to the linea aspera of the femur. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the pubic portion of the fascia lata, which separates it from the femoral artery and vein andINTERNAL FEMORAL REGION. 272 internal saphenous vein, and lower down with the profunda artery. By its posterior surface with the capsule of the hip-joint, obturator externus and adductor brevis, the obturator vessels being interposed. By its external harder with the psoas, the femoral artery resting upon the line of interval. By its internal border with the outer edge of the adductor longus. Obturator hernia is situated directly behind this muscle, which forms one of its coverings. The Adductor longus (adducere, to draw to; caput longum trici- pitis), the most superficial of the three adductors, arises by a round and thick tendon from the front surface of the os pubis, immediately below the angle of that bone; and, assuming a flattened and ex- panded form as it descends, is inserted into the middle third of the linea aspera. Relations.—By its anterior surf ace with the pubic portion of the fascia lata, and near its insertion, with the femoral artery and vein. By its p)osterior surface with the adductor brevis and magnus, the anterior branches of the obturator vessels and nerve, and near its insertion, with the profunda artery and vein. By its outer border with the pectineus, and by the inner border with the gracilis. The pectineus must be divided near its origin and turned out- wards, and the adductor longus through its middle, turning its ends to either side, to bring into view the adductor brevis. The Adductor brevis (caput breve tricipitis), placed behind the pectineus and adductor longus, is fleshy, and thicker than the ad- ductor longus; it arises from the body of the os pubis, and is inserted into the line leading from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera. Relations.—By its anterior stirface with the pectineus, adductor longus, and anterior branch of the obturator nerve and artery. By its posterior surface with the adductor magnus. By its outer border with the obturator externus, and conjoined tendon of the psoas and iliacus. By its inner border with the gracilis and adductor magnus. The adductor brevis is pierced near its insertion by the middle per- forating artery. The adductor brevis may now be divided from its origin and turned outwards, or its inner two-thirds may be cut away entirely, when the adductor magnus muscle will be exposed in its entire extent. The Adductor magnus (caput magnum tricipitis) is a broad triangular muscle, forming a septum of division between the muscles situated on the anterior and those on the posterior aspect of the thigh. It arises by fleshy fibres from the ramus of the pubes and ischium and from the side of the tuber ischii; and radiating in its passage outwards, is inserted into the whole length of the linea aspera, and inner condyle of the femur. The adductor magnus is pierced by five openings; the three superior, for the three perforating arteries; and the fourth, for the termination of the profunda. The fifth is the large oval opening, in the tendinous portion of the muscle, that gives passage to the femoral vessels.GKACILIS.—BICEPS PBMORIS. 273 Relations.—By its anterior siirface with the pectineus, adductor brevis, adductor longus, femoral artery and vein and profunda artery and vein, with their branches. By its 2Josierior surface with the semi'tendinosus, semi-membranosus, biceps, and gluteus maximus. By its inner border with the gracilis and sartorius. By its wpper border with the obturator externus, and quadratus femoris. The Gracilis (slender; rectus internus) is situated along the inner border of the thigh. It arises by a broad but very thin tendon, from the body of the os pubis along the edge of the symphysis, aud from the margin of the ramus of the pubes and ischium; it is inserted by a rounded tendon into the inner tuberosity of the tibia, beneath the expansion of the sartorius. Relations.—By its inner or superficial surface with the fascia lata, and below with the sartorius and internal saphenous nerve; the internal saphenous vein crosses it lying superficially to the fascia lata. By its outer or deep surface with the adductor longus, brevis, and magnus, and the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint, from which it is separated by a synovial bursa common to it and the tendons of the gracilis and semi-tendinosus. Actions.—The iliacus, psoas, pectineus, and adductor longus muscles bend the thigh upon the pelvis, and at the same time, from the obliquity of their insertion into the lesser trochanter and linea aspera, rotate the entire limb outwards; the pectineus and adductors adduct the thigh powerfully ; and from the manner of their insertion into the linea aspera, they assist in rotating the limb outwards. The gracilis is likewise an adductor of the thigh; but contributes also to the fle?:ion of the leg, by its attachment to the inner tuberosity of the tibia. Posterior Femoral Region. Biceps femoris, Semi-tendinosus, Semi-membranosus. Dissection.—Remove the integument and fascia on the posterior part of the thigh by two flaps, as on the anterior region, and turn aside the gluteus maximus from the upper part; the muscles may then be examined. ,The Biceps femoris (bis, double, Kt^aX/), head; flexor cruris externus vel fibularis) arises by two heads, one (caput longum) by a common tendon with the semi-tendinosus from the upper and back part of the tuber ischii; the other (caput breve) muscular and much shorter, from the lower two-thirds of the external border of the linea aspera. This muscle forms the outer hamstring, and is inserted by a strong tendon into the head of the fibula; a portion of the tendon being continued downwards into the fascia of the leg, and another being attached to the outer tuberosity of the tibia.

The Semi-tendinosus, remark- able for its long tendon, arises in common with the long head of the biceps, from the upper and back part of the tuberosity of the is- chium : the two muscles being closely united for several inches below their origia. It is inserted into the inner tuberosity of the tibia, immediately below the in- sertion of the tendon of the gracilis, and sends an expansion to the fascia of the leg.

The Semi-membranosus, remarkable for the tendinous expansion upon its anterior and posterior surface, arises from the tuberosity of the ischium, in front of the common origin of the two preceding muscles. It is inserted into the posterior part of the inner tuberosity of the tibia; at its insertion the tendon splits into three portions, one of which is inserted in a groove on the inner side of the head of the tibia, beneath the internal lateral ligament. The second is con- tinuous with an aponeurotic expansion that binds down the popliteus muscle, the popliteal fascia; and the third turns upwards and out- wards to the external condyle of the femur, forming the middle portion of the posterior ligament of the knee-joint (ligamentum pos- ticum Winslowii). The tendons of the semi-tendinosus, semi-membranosus, gracilis and sartorius, form the inner hamstring.

If the semi-membranosus muscle be turned down from its origin, the student will bring into view the broad and radiated expanse of the adductor magnus, upon which the three flexor muscles above described rest. Actions.—These three hamstring muscles are the direct flexors of the leg upon the thigh; and taking their fixed point from below, they balance the pelvis on the lower extremities. The biceps, from the obliquity of its direction, everts the leg when partly flexed, and the semi-tendinosus turns the leg inwards when in the same state of flexion. Anterior Tibial Region. Tibialis anticus. Extensor longus digitorum, Peroneus tertius, Extensor proprius pollicis. Dissection.—The dissection of the anterior tibial region is to be commenced by carrying an incision along the middle of the leg, midway between the tibia and fibula, from the knee to the ankle, and bounding it inferiorly by a transverse incision extending from one malleolus to the other. And to expose the tendons on the dorsum of the foot, the longitudinal incision may be carried onwards T 2ANTERIOR TIBIAL REGION. 276 to the outer side of tlie base another incision directed acre Fig. 124.* of the great toe, and he terminated by ss the heads of the metatarsal bones. The Tibialis anticus (flexor tarsi tibialis) arises from the outer tuberosity and upper two-thirds of the tibia, from the interosseous membrane, intermuscular fascia, and deep fascia; its tendon passes through a distinct sheath in the an- nular ligament, and is inserted into the inner and under side of the internal cuneiform bone, and base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. Relations.—By its anterior sur- face with the deep fascia, from which many of its superior fibres arise, and with the anterior annu- lar ligament. By its posterior sur- face with the interosseous mem- brane, tibia, ankle-joint, and bones of the tarsus. By its internal sur- face with the tibia; and by its external surface with the extensor longus digitorum, extensor proprius pollicis, and anterior tibial vessels and nerve. The Extensor longus digitorum (extensor communis longus) arises from the outer tuberosity of the tibia, from the head and tipper three-fourths of the fibula, from the interosseous membrane, intennus- cular fascia and deep fascia. Near the ankle it divides into four ten- dons, which pass beneath the annular ligament thi-ough a proper tendinous pulley (the sling ligament of Betzius) to be inserted into the * Muscles of the anterior tibial region. 1.

The mode of insertion of the extensor tendons, both in the hand and in the foot, is remarkable; each tendon spreads into a broad aponeurosis over the first phalanx; this aponeurosis is strengthened on its borders by the insertion of the lumbricales and interossei, and divides into three slips; the middle slip is inserted into the base of the second phalanx, and the two lateral slips are continued onwards, to be in- serted into the base of the third. Relations.—By its anterior swrface, with the deep fascia of the leg and foot, and anterior annular ligament. By its posterior surface with the interosseous membrane, fibula, ankle-joint, extensor brevis digitorum (which separates its tendons from the tarsus) meta- tarsus and phalanges. By its inmer surface, with the tibialis anticus, extensor proprius pollicis, and anterior tibial vessels. By its outer border with the peroneus longus and brevis. The Peroneus tertitjs (flexor tarsi fibularis) arises from the lower fourth of the fibula and intermuscular fascia, and is inserted into the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe. Although apparently but a mere division or continuation of the extensor longus digitorum, this muscle may be looked upon as analogous to the flexor carpi ulnaris of the forearm. Sometimes it is altogether wanting. The Extensor proprius pollicis (extensor hallucis longus) lies between the tibialis anticus and extensor longus digitorum. It arises from the lower two-thirds of the fibula and interosseous mem- brane. ' Its tendon passes through a distinct sheath in the annular ligament, and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the deep fascia of the leg and foot, and anterior annular ligament. By its posterior surface with the interosseous membrane, fibula, tibia, ankle-joint, extensor brevis digitorum, and the bones and articulations of the great toe. It is crossed upon this aspect by the anterior tibial vessels and nerve. By its outer side with the extensor longus digitorum, and in the foot with the dorsalis pedis artery and veins; the outer side of its tendon upon the dorsum of the foot being the guide to these vessels. By its inner side with the tibialis anticus, and anterior tibial vessels. Actions.—^The tibialis anticus and peroneus tertius are direct flexors of the tarsus upon the leg; acting in conjunction with the tibialis posticus they direct the foot inwards, and with the peroneus longus and brevis outwards. They assist also in preserving the flatness of the foot during progression. The extensor longus digitorum and extensor proprius pollicis are direct extensors of the phalanges; but, continuing their action, they assist the tibialis anticus and peroneus tertius, in flexing the entire foot upon the leg. Taking their origin from below, they increase the stability of the ankle.POSTEKIOK TIBIAL REGION. •278 Mg. 125.* ' Posterior Tibial Region. Superficial Group. Gastrocnemius, Plantaris, Soleus. Dissection. — Make an incision from the middle of the popliteal space down the middle of the posterior part of the leg to the heel, bounding it inferiorly by a transverse incision passing between the tv/o malleoli. Turn aside the flaps of integument and remove the fasciae from the whole of this region; the gastrocne- if. JlMlB'lii, mil mius muscle will then be exposed. The GrASTROCNEMius {yaarpoKvrjfXLOv, the bellied part of the leg; gemellus surse) arises by two heads (gemellus externus et internus) from the upper part of the two condyles of the femur, the inner head being the longest. They unite to form the beautiful muscle so characteristic of this region of the limb. It is inserted, by means of the tendo-Achillis, into the lower part of the posterior tulserosity of the OS calcis, a synovial bursa being placed between the tendon and the upper part of the tuberosity. The gastrocnemius must be removed from its origin, and turned down in order to expose the next muscle. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the deep fascia of the leg, which se- parates it from the external saphenous y w vein, and with the external saphenous nerve. By its deep surface with the lateral portions of the posterior ligament of the knee-joint, the popliteus, plantaris, and soleus. The internal head of the muscle rests against the pos- terior surface of the internal condyle of the femur; the external head against the outer side of the external condyle. In the latter a sesa- moid bone is sometimes found. * Superficial muscles of the posterior aspect of the leg. 1. The biceps, form- ing the outer hamstring. 2.

The SoLEUS (solea, a sole,) is the broad muscle upon which the plantaris rests. It arises from the head and upper half of the fibula, from the oblique line and middle third of the tibia and from a tendi- nous arch thrown across between these two portions. Its fibres con- verge to the tendo-Achillis, by which it is inserted into the posterior tuberosity of the os calcis. The tendinous arch gives passage to the popliteal vessels and nerve in their course to the leg. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the gastrocnemius and plantaris. By its deep surface with the intermuscular fascia, which separates it from the flexor longus digitorum, tibialis posticus, flexor longus pollicis, posterior tibial vessels and nerve, and peroneal vessels. Actions.—The three muscles (triceps surse, extensor pedis) of the calf draw powerfully on the os calcis, and lift the heel; continuing their action, they raise the entire body. This movement is attained by means of a lever of the second power, the fulcrum (the toes) being at one end, the weight (the body supported on the tibia) in the mi(3.dle, and the power (these muscles) at the other extremity. They are, therefore, the walking muscles, and perform all move- ments that require the support of the whole body from the ground, as dancing, leaping, &c. Taking their fixed point from below, they steady the leg upon the foot. Deep layer. Popliteus, Flexor longus digitorum, Flexor longus pollicis. Tibialis posticus. Dissection.—After the removal of the soleus, the deep layer will be found bound down by an intermusculai fascia which is to be dissected away; the muscles may then be examined. The Popliteus muscle (poples, the ham of the leg) forms the floor of the popliteal region at its lower part, and is bound tightly down by a strong fascia derived from the middle slip of the tendon of the semi-membranosus muscle. It arises by a rounded tendon from a deep groove on the outer side of the external condyle of the femur, beneath the external lateral ligament and within the capsular liga- ment of the joint; and spreading obliquely over the head of the tibia, is inserted into the surface of bone above its oblique line. This line is called, from being the limit of insertion of the popliteus muscle, the popliteal line. Relations.—By its superficial surface with a thick fascia which separates it from the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and popliteal vessels280 POSTERIOR TIBIAL REGION. and nerve. By its deep surface with the synovial membrane of the knee-joint, and upper part of the tibia. The Flexor longus pollicis (flexor Mg. 126.* hallucis longus) is the most superficial of the next three muscles. It arises from the lower two-thirds of the fibula, and passes through a groove in the astragalus and OS calcis, which is converted by ten- dinous fibres into a distinct sheath lined by a synovial membrane, into the sole of the foot; and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the intermuscular fascia, which separates it from the soleus and tendo- Achillis. By its deep surface with the tibialis posticus, fibula, peroneal vessels, interosseous membrane, and ankle-joint. By its outer horder with the peroneus longus and brevis. By its inner horder with the flexor longus digitorum. In the foot, the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis is connected with that of the flexor longus digitorum by a short tendinous slip. The Flexor longus digitorum (per- forans; flexor communis longus) arises from the surface of the tibia, immediately below the popliteal line. Its tendon passes through a sheath, common to it and the tibialis posticus, behind the inner mal- leolus ; it then passes through a second sheath which is connected with a groove in the astragalus and os calcis into the sole of the foot, where it divides into four tendons, which are inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the four lesser toes, perforating the tendons of the flexor brevis digitorum. * Deep layer of muscles of the posterior tibial region. 1.

Relations.—By its superficial surface with the intermuscular fascia, which separates it from the soleus, and with the posterior tibial vessels and nerve. By its deep surface with the tibia and tibialis posticus. In the sole of the foot its tendon is in relation with the abductor pollicis and flexor brevis digitorum, which lie superfici- ally to it, and it crosses the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. At the point of crossing it receives a tendinous slip of communication. The flexor longus pollicis must now be removed from its origin, and the flexor longus digitorum drawn aside, to bring into view the entire extent of the tibialis posticus. The Tibialis posticus (nauticus; extensor tarsi tibialis) lies upon the interosseous membrane, between the two bones of the leg. It arises by two heads from the adjacent sides of the tibia and fibula their whole length, from the interosseous membrane, and from an aponeurosis which binds it in its place. Its tendon passes inwards beneath the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, and runs in the same sheath; it then passes through a proper sheath over the deltoid ligament, and beneath the calcaneo-scaphoid articulation, to be in- serted into the tuberosity of the scaphoid and internal cuneiform bone, a process of its tendon being.prolonged outwards to the external cuneiform. While in the common sheath behind the internal mal- leolus, the tendon of the tibialis posticus lies internally to that of the fleXor longus digitorum, from which it is separated by a thin fibrous partition. A sesamoid bone is usually met with in the tendon close to its insertion. Relations. —By its superficial surface with the intermuscular aponeurosis, flexor longus pollicis, flexor longus digitorum, posterior tibial vessels and nerve, peroneal vessels, and in the sole of the foot with the abductor pollicis. By its deep surface with the interos- seous membrane, fibula and tibia, ankle-joint and astragalus. The anterior tibial artery passes between the two heads of the muscle. The student will observe that the two latter muscles change their relative position to each other in their course. Thus, in the leg, the position of the three muscles from within outwards, is, flexor longus digitorum, tibialis posticus, flexor longus pollicis. At the inner mal- leolus, the relation of the tendons is, tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, both in the same sheath; then a broad groove, which lodges the posterior tibial artery, venas comites, and nerve; and lastly, the flexor longus pollicis. Actions.—The popliteus is a flexor of the tibia upon the thigh, carrying it at the same time inwards so as to invert the leg. The flexor longus pollicis, and flexor longus digitorum, are the long flexors of the toes ; their tendons are connected in the foot by a short ten- dinous band, hence they necessarily act together. The tibialis posticus is an extensor of the tarsus upon the leg, and an antagonist to the tibialis anticus. It combines with the tibialis anticus in adduction of the foot.282 FIBULAR REGION. Fibular Region. PeroneiTS longus. Peroneiis brevis. Dissection.—These muscles are exposed by continuing the dissec- tion of the anterior tibial region outwards beyond the filjula, to the border of the posterior tibial region. The Peroneus longus {Trepovr], fibula ; extensor tarsi fibularis longior) arises from the head and upper half of the outer side of the fibula, from the deep fascia and intermuscular septa, and terminates in a long tendon, which passes behind the external malleolus, and obliquely across the sole of the foot, through the groove in the cuboid bone, to be inserted into the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. Its tendon is thickened where it glides behind the external malleolus, and a sesamoid bone is developed in that part which plays upon the cuboid bone. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the fascia of the leg and foot. By its deep surface with the fibula, peroneus brevis, os calcis, cuboid bone, and near the head of the fibula with the external popli- teal nerve. By its anterior border it is separated from the extensor longus digitorum by the attachment of the fascia of the leg to the fibula; and by the posterior border by the same medium from the soleus and flexor longus pollicis. The tendon of the peroneus longus is furnished with three fibrous sheaths and as many synovial mem- branes ; the first is situated behind the external malleolus, and is common to this muscle and the peroneus brevis, the second on the outer side of the os calcis, and the third on the cuboid bone. The Peroneus brevis (extensor tarsi fibularis brevior) lies be- neath the peroneus longus; it arises from the lower half of the fibula and intermuscular septa, and terminates in a tendon which passes behind the external malleolus and through a groove in the os calcis, to be inserted into the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the peroneus longus and fascia of the leg and foot. By its deep surface with the fibula, os calcis, and cuboid bone. The lateral relations of the muscle are the same as those of the peroneiis longus. The tendon of the peroneus brevis has but two tendinous sheaths and two synovial membranes, one being behind the external malleolus and common to both peronei, the other upon the side of the os calcis. Actions.—The peronei muscles are extensors of the foot, conjointly with the tibialis posticus. They antagonise the tibialis anticus and peroneus tertius, which are flexors of the foot. The whole of these muscles acting together, tend to maintain the flatness of the foot, so necessary to security in walking.283 MUSCLES OF THE EOOT. Foot. Dorsal Region. Extensor brevis digitorum, Interossei dorsales. The Extensor brevis digitorum muscle arises from the outer side of the os calcis, crosses the foot obliquely, and terminates in four tendons, the innermost of which is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, and the other three into the sides of the long extensor tendons of the second, third, and fourth toes. Relations.—By its upper surface with the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum, peroneus brevis, and with the deep fascia of the foot. By its under surface with the tarsal and metatarsal bones. Its inner border is in relation with the dorsalis pedis artery, the innermost tendon of the muscle crossing that artery just before its division. The Interossei dorsales (bicipites) are placed between the meta- tarsal bones; they resemble the analogous muscles in the hand in arising by two heads from the adjacent sides of the metatarsal bones; their tendons are inserted into the base of the first phalanx, and into the digital expansion of the tendons of the long extensor. The first dorsal interosseous is inserted into the inner side of the second ioe, and is therefore an adductor: the other three are inserted into the outer side of the second, third, and fourth toes, and are consequently abductors. Relations.—By their upper surface with a strong fascia which separates them from the extensor tendons. By their under surface with the plantar interossei. Each of the muscles gives passage to a small artery (posterior perforating) which communicates with the external plantar artery. And between the heads of the first inter- osseous muscle the dorsalis pedis takes its course. Plantar Region. (First layer.) Abductor pollicis, Abductor minimi digiti. Flexor brevis digitorum. Dissection.—The sole of the foot is best dissected by carrying an incision around the heel, and along the inner and outer border of the foot, to the great and little toes. This incision should divide the integument and superficial fascia, and both together should be dis- sected from the deep fascia, as far forward as the base of the pha- langes, where they may be removed from the foot altogether. The deep fascia should then be removed, and the first layer of muscles will be brought into view.MUSCLES OF THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. 284 The Abductor pollicis (vel hallucis) lies along the inner border of the foot; it arises by two heads, between which the tendons of the long flexors, arteries, veins, and nerves, enter the sole of the foot. One head proceeds from the inner tuberosity of the os calcis, the other from the internal annular ligament and plantar fascia; it is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, and into the internal sesamoid bone. Relations,—By its superficial sur- face with the internal portion of the plantar fascia. By its deep surface with the flexor brevis pollicis, mus- cuius accessorius, tendons of the flexor longus digitorum, flexor longus pol- licis, tibialis anticus and posticus, plantar vessels and nerves, and tarsal bones. On its outer border with the flexor brevis digitorum, from which it is separated by a vertical septum of the plantar fascia. The Abductor minimi digiti (digiti quinti) lies along the outer border of the sole of the foot. It arises from the outer tuberosity of the OS calcis, and from the plantar fascia, as far forward as the base of the fifth metatarsal bone; and is in- serted into the base of the first pha- lanx of the little toe. Relations.—By its superficial sur- face with the external portion of the plantar fascia. By its deep surface with the musculus accessorius, flexor brevis minimi digiti, tarsal bones, and metatarsal bone of the little toe. By its inner side with the flexor bre- vis digitorum, from which it is se- parated by the vertical septum of the plantar fascia. The Flexor brevis digitorum (perforatus) is placed between the two preceding muscles. It arises from the under surface of the OS calcis, from the plantar fascia, and intermuscular septa; and is inserted by four tendons into the base of the second phalanx of the four lesser toes. Each tendon divides, previously to its insertion, to * First layer of muscles of the sole of tlie foot; this layer is exposed by the removal of the plantar fascia. 1. Os calcis. 2.

By its deep surface with a thin layer of fascia which separates it from the mnsculus accessorius, tendons of the flexor longus digi- torum and flexor longus pollicis, and plantar vessels and nerves. By its borders with the vertical septa of the plantar fascia, which separate the muscle, on the one side from the ab- ductor pollicis, on the other from the abductor minimi digiti. Second Layer. Musculus accessorius, Lumbricales. Dissection. — The three preceding muscles must be divided from their origin, and anteriorly through their tendons, and removed, in order to bring into view the second layer. The MusouLus accessorius arises by two slips from either side of the under surface of the os calcis; the inner slip being fleshy, the outer tendinous and blended with the ligamentum longum plantse. It is inserted into the outer side and upper surface of the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum; of which muscle it may be regarded as a second and short head. It has been named " massa carnea Jacobi Sylvii" and " caro quadrata Sylvii." Relations.—By its superficial surface with the three muscles of the superficial layer, from which it is separated by their fascial sheaths, and with the external plantar vessels and nerve. By its deep surface with the under part of the os calcis and long calcaneo- cuboid ligament.

They pass between the digital slips of the plantar fascia to their insertion. The innermost lumbricalis is connected with only one tendon. Dissection.—The tendons of the long flexors and the muscles con- nected with them must be removed, to see clearly the attachments of the third layer. The Flexoe brevis pollicis arises by a pointed tendinous pro- cess from the side of the cuboid, the external cuneiform bone, and the expanded tendon of the tibialis posticus; it is inserted by two heads into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe. Two sesa- moid bones are developed in the tendons of insertion of these two heads, and the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis lies in the groove between them. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the abductor pollicis, tendon of the flexor longus pollicis, and plantar fascia. By its deep surface with the tarsal bones, the metatarsal bone of the great toe, and the insertion of the tendon of the peroneus longus. By its inner border with the abductor pollicis; and by its outer border with the adductor pollicis; with both of these muscles it is blended near its insertion. The Adductor pollicis arises from the cuboid bone, from the sheath of the tendon of the peroneus longus, and from the base of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. It is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, in conjunction with the outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis. Relations.—By its superficial surface with the tendons of the flexor longus and flexor brevis digitorum, the musculus accessorius, and lumbricales.

By its inner border with the flexor brevis pollicis; with which its fibres are blended. The Transversus pedis arises by fleshy slips, from the heads of the metatarsal bones of the four lesser toes. It passes transversely inwards to be inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, its tendon being blended with that of the adductor pollicis. The transversus pedis is regarded by some anatomists as a short head of the adductor pollicis; in its action it is obviously an ad- Third Layer.

The Interossei plantares muscles are three in number, and are placed upon rather than between the metatarsal bones. They arise from the base of the metatarsal bones of the three outer toes, and are inserted into the inner side of the extensor tendon and base of the ;first phalanx of the same toes. In their action they are adductors. Relations.—'Bj ih&n: superficial surface with the dorsal interossei and metatarsal bones.

In these actions they are grouped in the following manner:— Flexion. Flexor longus digitorum, Flexor brevis digitorum, Flexor accessorius. Flexor minimi digiti. Extetision. Extensor longus digitorum, Extensor brevis digitoriun. Adduction. Adduction. Interossei \ dorsal, Interossei, three dorsal, ' I three plantar. Abductor minimi digiti. The great toe, like the thumb in the hand, enjoys an independent action, and is provided with distinct muscles to perform its move- ments. These movements are precisely the same as those of the other toes, vi^.:288 MUSCLES OF THE SOLE OP THE FOOT. Flexion. Extension.

The only muscles excluded from this table are the lumbricales,, four small muscles, which, from their attachments to the tendons of the long flexor, appear to be assistants in its action.289 CHAPTER IV. OF THE FASCIA. Fascia (fascia, a bandage) is the name assigned to laminae of various extent and thickness, which are distributed through the dif- ferent regions of the body, for the purpose of investing or protecting the softer and more delicate organs. From a consideration of their structure, these fascia may be arranged into two groups : cellulo- fibrous fasciae, and aponeurotic fasciae. The cellulo-fibrous fascia is best illustratedby the common subcu- taneous investment of the entire body, the superficial fascia. This structure is situated immediately beneath the integument over every part of the frame, and is the medium of connexion between that layer and the deeper parts. It is composed of cellulo-fibrous tissue, containing in its areola an abundance of adipose cells. The fat being a bad conductor of caloric, serves to retain the warmth of the body; while it forms at the same time a yielding tissue, through which minute vessels and nerves pass to the skin, without incurring the risk • of obstruction from injury or pressure. By dissection, the superficial fascia may be separated into two layers, between which are found the superficial or cutaneous vessels and nerves ; as the superficial epigastric artery, saphenous veins, radial and ulnar veins, superficial lymphatic vessels, and the cutaneous muscles, as the platysma myoides, orbicularis palpebrarum, sphincter ani, &c. In other situations, the cellulo-fibrous fascia is found condensed into a strong and inelastic membrane, as is exemplified in the deep fascia of the neck, the thoracic, tranversaKs, and perineal fascia, and the sheaths of vessels. The aponeurotic fascia is the strongest kind of investing mem- brane ; it is composed of tendinous fibres running parallel with each other, and connected by other fibres of the same kind passing in difi'erent directions. When freshly exposed, it is white, glistening, and iridescent, and is tough, inelastic, and unyielding. In the limbs it forms the deep fascia, enclosing and forming distinct sheaths to all the muscles and tendons. It is thick on the outer and least pro- tected side of the limb, and thinner on its inner side. It is firmly connected to the bones, and to the prominent points of each region, as to the pelvis, knee, and ankle, in the lower, and to the clavicle, scapula, elbow, and wrist, in the upper extremity. It assists the muscles in their action, by keeping up a tonic pressure on their sur- uFASCIA OP THE HEAD AND NECK. 290 face ; aids materially in the circulation of the fluids in opposition to the laws of gravity ; and in the palm of the hand and sole of the foot is a powerful protection to the structures which enter into the com- position of these regions. In some situations its tension is regulated by muscular action, as by the tensor vaginae femoris and gluteus maxim us in the thigh, by the biceps in the leg, and by the biceps and palmaris longus in the arm ; in other situations it affords an extensive surface for the origin of the fibres of muscles. The fasciae may be arranged, like the other components of the body, into—1. Those of the head and neck. 2. Those of the trunk. 3. Those of the upper extremity. 4. Those of the lower extremity. FASCIA OF THE HEAD AND NECK, The Temporal fascia is a strong aponeurotic membrane which covers in the temporal muscle at each side of the head, and gives origin by its internal surface to some of its fibres. It is attached to the whole extent of the temporal ridge above, and to the zygo- matic arch below; in the latter situation it is thick and divided into two layers, the external being connected to the upper border of the arch ; the internal to its inner surface. Some fat is found between these two layers, and the orbital branch of the temporal artery. The temporal fascia is covered in by the aponeurosis (galea aponeurotica) of the occipito-frontalis muscle, which descends to be attached to the zygomatic arch. Cervical fascia.—The fascise of the neck are the superficial and deep. The superficial cervical fascia is a part of the com- mon superficial fascia of the entire body, and is only interesting from containing between its layers the platysma myoides muscle. The deep cervical fascia is a strong cellule-fibrous membrane, which invests the muscles of the neck, and retains and supports the vessels and nerves. It commences posteriorly at the ligamentum nuchse, and passes forwards at each side beneath the trapezius muscle to the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid ; here it divides into two layers, which embrace that muscle and unite upon its ante- rior border to be prolonged onwards to the middle line of the neck, where it becomes continuous with the fascia of the opposite side. Besides thus constituting a sheath for the sterno-mastoid, it also forms sheaths for the other muscles of the neck over which it passes. If the superficial layer (anterior layer) of the sheath of the sterno- mastoid be traced upwards, it will be found to pass over the parotid gland and masseter muscle (fascia parotideo-masseterica), to be inserted into the zygomatic arch ; if it be traced downwards, it will be seen to pass in front of the clavicle, and become lost upon the pectoralis major muscle. If the deep layer (posterior layer) of the sheath be examined superiorly, it will be found attached to the styloid process, from which it is reflected to the angle of the lower jaw, forming the stylo-maxillary ligament; and if it be followedDEEP CERVICAL FASCIA. 291 downwards, it will be found connected with the tendon of the omo- hyoid muscle, and may thence be traced behind the clavicle, where it encloses the subclavius muscle, and being extended from the carti- lage of the first rib to the coracoid process, constitutes the costo- coracoid membrane or ligament (fascia costo-clavicularis). In front of the sterno-mastoid muscle, the deep fascia is attached to the border of the lower jaw, os hyoides, and anterior bellies of the digastricus (fascia supra-hyoidea), and forms a sheath for the sub- maxillary gland. Inferiorly it divides into two layers, one of which is attached to the interclavicular ligament and upper border of the sternum ; the other to its inner border.

The thoracic fascia* is a dense layer of cellulo-fibrous membrane stretched horizontally across the superior opening of the thorax. It is firmly attached to the concave margin of the first rib, and to the inner surface of the sternum. In front it leaves an opening for the connexion of the cervical with the thoracic portion of the thymus gland, and behind, forms an arch across the vertebral column, to give passage to the oesophagus. At the point where the great vessels and trachea pass through the thoracic fascia, it divides into an ascending and descending layer. The ascending layer is attached to the trachea, and becomes con- tinuous with the sheath of the carotid vessels, and with the deep cervical fascia ; the descending layer descends upon the trachea to its bifurcation, surrounds the large vessels arising from the arch of the aorta, and the upper part of the arch itself, and is continuous with the fibrous layer of the pericardium. It is connected also with the vense innominatse and superior cava, and is attached to the cellulo-fibrous capsule of the thymus gland. " The thoracic fascia," according to Sir Astley Cooper, " performs three important offices :— "1st. It forms the upper boundary of the chest, as the diaphragm does the lower. " 2nd. It steadily preserves the relative situation of the parts which enter and quit the thoracic opening. '' 3rd. It attaches and supports the heart in its situation, through the medium of its connexion with the aorta and large vessels which are placed at its curvature." ABDOMINAL FASCIA. The lower part of the parietes of the abdomen, and the cavity of the pelvis, are strengthened by a layer of fascia which lines their internal surface, and at the bottom of the latter cavity is reflected inwards upon the sides of the bladder. This fascia is continuous throughout the whole of the above-mentioned surface ; but for con- venience of description is considered under the several names of transversalis fascia, iliac fascia, and pelvic fascia ; the two former meet at the crest of the ilium and Pouf)art's ligament, the latter is confined to the cavity of the true pelvis. The fascia transversalis (Fascia Cooperi)+ is a thin fibrous mem- brane, which lines the inner surface of the transversalis muscle, and is interposed between that muscle and the peritoneum. It is thick * See Sir Astley Cooper's work on the " Anatomy of the Thymus Gland." t Sir Astley Cooper first described this fascia in its important relation to inguinal hernia.OBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA. 293 and dense below, near the lower part of tlie abdomen ; but becomes thinner as it ascends, and is gradually lost in the subserous cellular tissue. It is attached inferiorly to the reflected margin of Poupart's ligament and to the crest of the ilium; internally, to the pectineal line and border of the rectus muscle; and, at the inner part of the femoral arch, is continued beneath Poupart's ligament, and forms the anterior segment of the crural canal, or sheath of the femoral vessels. The internal abdominal ring (annulus inguinalis intemus, vel posterior) is situated in this fascia, at about midway between the symphysis pubis and anterior superior spine of the ilium, and half an inch above Poupart's ligament; it is oval in form, and bounded on its inner side by a well-marked falciform border, but is ill- defined around its outer margin. From the circumference of this ring is given off an infundibuliform process which surrounds the testicle and spermatic cord, constituting the fascia propria of the latter, and forms the first investment to the sac of oblique inguinal hernia. It is the strength of the transversalis fascia, in the interval between the tendon of the rectus and the internal abdominal ring, that defends the parietes against the frequent occurrence of direct inguinal hernia. 1 INGUINAL. HERNIA. Inguinal hernia is of two kinds, oblique and direct. In Oblique inguinal hernia the intestine escapes from the cavity of the abdomen into the spermatic canal (canalis inguinalis), through the internal abdominal ring, pressing before it a pouch of peritoneum which constitutes the hernial sac, and distending the infundibuliform process of the transversalis fascia. After emerging through the internal abdominal ring it passes first beneath the lower and arched border of the transversalis muscle; then beneath the lower border of the internal oblique muscle ; and finally through the external abdominal ring (annulus inguinalis extemus, vel anterior) in the aponeurosis of the external oblique. From the transversalis muscle it receives no investment; while passing beneath the lower border of the internal oblique it obtains the cre- master muscle ; and upon escaping at the external abdominal ring, receives the intercolunmar fascia. So that the coverings of an oblique inguinal hernia, after it has emerged through the external abdominal ring, are, from the surface to the intestine, the Integument, Superficial fascia, Intercolumnar fascia, Cremaster muscle, Transversalis, or infundibuliform fascia, Peritoneal sac.DIKECT INGUINAL HERNIA. 294 The spermatic canal, which in the normal condition of the abdo- minal parietes serves for the passage of the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament with its vessels in the female, is abont one inch and a half in length. It is bounded in front by the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle; behind by the transversalis fascia, and the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis ; above by the arched borders of the internal oblique and transversalis; below by the grooved border of Poupart's ligament : and at each extremity by one of the abdominal rings, the internal ring at the inner, the external ring at the outer extremity. These relations may be more distinctly illustrated by the following plan : There are three* varieties of oblique inguinal hernia : common, congenital, and encysted. Common oblique hernia is that which has been described above. Congenital hernia results from the non-closure of the pouch of peritoneum carried downwards into the scrotum by the testicle, during its descent in the foetus. In consequence of this defect, the intestine at some period of life is forced into the peritoneal canal, and descends through it into the tunica vaginalis, where it lies in contact with the testicle; so that congenital hernia has no proper sac, but is contained within the tunica vaginalis. The other coverings are the same as those of common inguinal hernia. Encysted hernia (hernia infantilis, of Hey) is that form of pro- trusion in which the pouch of peritoneum forming the tunica vaginalis, being only partially closed, and remaining open externally to the abdomen, admits of the hernia passing into the scrotum, behind the tunica vaginalis. So that the surgeon, in operating upon this variety, requires to divide three layers of serous membrane; the first and second layers being those of the tunica vaginalis; and the third the true sac of the hernia. Direct inguinal hernia has received its name from passing directly through the external abdominal ring, and forcing before it * Velpeau describes a fourth, in which the protrusion takes place between the edge of the rectus and the umbilical ligament, and then takes the course of the spermatic canal.

This portion of the wall of the abdomen is strengthened by the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis, which is pressed before the hernia, and forms one of its investments. Its coverings are, the Integument, Superficial fascia, Intercolumnar fascia, Conjoined tendon, Transversalis fascia, Peritoneal sac. Direct inguinal hernia differs from oblique, firstly, in never at- taining the same bulk, in consequence of the resisting nature of the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis and trans- versalis fascia ; secondly, in its direction, having a tendency to pro- trude from the middle line rather than towards it. Thirdly, in making for itself a new passage through the abdominal parietes, instead of following a natural channel; and fourthly, in the relation of the neck of its sac to the epigastric artery ; that vessel lying to the outer side of the opening of the sac of direct hernia, and to the inner side of that of oblique hernia. All the forms of inguinal hernia are designated scrotal, when they have descended into the cavity of the scrotum. The Fascia iliaca (lumbo-iliaca) is the aponeurotic investment of the psoas and iliacus muscle ; and, like the fascia transversalis, is thick below, and becomes gradually thinner as it ascends. It is attached superiorly, along the edge of the psoas, to the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle, to the liga- mentum arcuatum internum, and to the bodies of the lumbar verte- brae, leaving arches corresponding with the constricted portions of the vertebrae for the passage of the lumbar vessels. Lower down it passes beneath the external iliac vessels, and is attached along the margin of the true pelvis ; externally it is connected to the crest of the ilium; and, inferiorly, to the outer two-thirds of Poupart's ligament, where it is continuous with the fascia transversalis. Passing beneath Poupart's ligament, it surrounds the psoas and iliacus muscles to their termination, and beneath the inner part of the femoral arch forms the posterior segment of the sheath of the femoral vessels. The Fascia pelvica is an aponeurotic layer situated beneath the peritoneum, forming a covering to the walls of the pelvis, and reflected from its walls upon the viscera. The pelvic fascia is attached to the internal surface of the ossa pubis near the symphysis, to the body of the pubes above the origin of the obturator internus muscle, to the ilio-pectineal line of the brim of the pelvis as far back as the sacro-iliac articulation, and to the margin of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen. Having descended upon the wall of thePELVIC FASCIA. 296 pelvis as low as the pubic arch in front, and the spine of the ischium behind, it divides, in the direction of a line drawn between those points, into two layers, internal and external. The internal layer (recto-vesical) is continued downwards to the prostate gland, Fig. 130.* neck of the bladder, (vagina), and rectum, to which it is closely attached ; and is reflected for a short distance upwards and down- wards on those viscera. This layer is in contact, by its external surface, with the levator ani muscle and coccygeus; and is pro- longed backwards over the sacral nerves to the lower part of the sacrum and the coccyx, to which it is attached, meeting at the middle line the layer of the opposite side. The external layer is the obturator fascia^ it covers in the obturator muscle, and is attached to the ramus of the pubes and ischium in front, and to the tube- rosity of the ischium and falciform border of the great sacro- ischiatic ligament below. The levator ani arises from the line of division of the two preceding layers.

Upon the rectum and vagina it also forms a sheath. The posterior boundary of the pelvic fascia forms a free semilunar border in front of the pyriformis muscle. Perineal fasci.^;.

The superficial fascia consists as in other situations of two layers, one lying next the skin and containing an abundance of fat, the other more condensed lying in contact with the muscles. The superficial layer in the perineum is connected with the raphe at the middle line and with the external border of the superficial sphincter, and is continuous by its circumference with the dartos of the scrotum or cellular tissue of the labia majora in front, with the superficial fascia of the thighs on each side, and with the superficial fascia covering the glutei maximi and coccyx behind. The deep layer or proper perineal fascia (fascia perinei superfi- cialis) is divisible into two portions, anterior and posterior, the former investing the muscles of the perineum, the other the ischio-rectal fossa. The anterior portion (fascia ischio-pubica, Velpeau) is a thin aponeurotic layer which covers in the muscles of the genital region of the perineum and root of the penis. It is firmly attached at each side to the ramus of the pubes and ischium; posteriorly it is re- Fig. 132.* * The pubic arch and perineal fasciae. 1, 1, 1.

The continua- tion of the perineal fascia into the triangular ligament along the posterior border of the trans v^ersi perinei muscles, is a barrier to the extension of extravasation of urine backwards, and the chief cause of its advance into the scrotum and lower part of the abdomen. The posterior portion of the perineal fascia (fascia analis; ischio- rectalis; Velpeau) lines the deep fossa (excavatio perinei) which sur- rounds the anus and levator ani muscles and is bounded externally by the ischia and internal obturator muscles, and behind by the glutei maximi, the ischio-rectal fossa. The ischio-rectal fascia is continuous with the anterior portion of the fascia perinei in front; invests the levatores ani as high as their origin, and the obturator fascia at each side, and is attached to the tuberosities of the ischia and great sacro-ischiatic ligaments. In the ischio-rectal fossa the two layers of the superficial fascia are separated by the masses of fat which fill that cavity. The deep perineal fascia (ligamentum triangulare; perineale; Camper's ligament) is a thin layer of aponeurosis which is stretched across the anterior portion of the outlet of the pelvis; it is attached on each side to the pelvic border of the ramus of the pubes and ischiuEtt as far back as the origin of the erector penis muscle. An- teriorly, it is convex and closely connected with the subpubic liga- ment ; while, posteriorly, it is concave, and turns forwards around the posterior border of the transversi perinei muscles, to become continuous with the superficial perineal fascia. At its middle, it is about an inch and a half in depth; at one inch below the pubic arch, it is pierced by the membranous portion of the urethra, and nearer the pubic arch, by the dorsal vein of the penis and internal pudic arteries. Directly behind the ligament are situated the compressor urethrae muscle, the arteries of the bulb, and Cowper's glands, and more deeply the pelvic fascia, which has been sometimes described as a posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia. FASCIA OP THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The superficial fascia of the upper extremity contains between its layers the superficial veins and lymphatics, and superficial nerves. The deep fascia is thin over the deltoid and pectoralis major muscle, and in the axillary space, but thick on the dorsum of the scapula, where it binds down the infraspinatus muscle. It is attached to the clavicle, coracoid process, acromion process, and spine of the scapula, and forms a separate sheath for all the muscles of the scapula and shoulder. In the upper arm (fascia brachialis) it is somewhat stronger, receives fibres from the lower border of the pec- toralis major, latissimus dorsi, as also from the costo-coracoid mem-300 FASCIA OP THE UPPER EXTREMITY, brane and deltoid, and forms an anterior and posterior sheath for the muscles lying in front of and behind the humerus. It is attached to the condyloid ridges, by means of the infernal and ex- ternal intermuscular septum (ligamenta intermuscularia) and is inserted inferiorly into the two condyles, the olecranon, and posterior border of the ulna, being continuous between these points with the fascia of the forearm. Besides forming separate sheaths for the muscles, the anterior portion of the brachial fascia gives a sheath likewise to the brachial vessels and median nerve. The deep fascia of the forearm, fascia antihrachii, is very strong, and at the bend of the elbow its thickness is augmented by a broad band, which is given off from the inner side of the tendon of the biceps. It is firmly attached to the olecranon process, to the uLna, and to the prominent points about the wrist, forms sheaths for the muscles and vessels, gives origin to some of the fibres of the muscles, and is pierced a little above the wrist by the tendon of the palmaris longus. At the wrist the transverse fibres form the anterior and posterior annular ligament. The anterior annular ligament is a narrow band of fibres attached externally to the scaphoid, and internally to the pisiform bone and tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris; it is continuous above with the fascia antibrachii, and below with the proper annular ligament of the wrist; being separated from the latter by the ulnar vessels and tendon of the flexor carpi radiaKs. The posterior annular ligament thicker than the anterior, is an oblique band about half an inch in breadth, extending from the lower end and styloid process of the radius, to the cuneiform and pisiform bone on the border of the carpus. It is continuous above with the fascia of the forearm, below with the thin fascia of the dorsum of the hand, and sends processes inwards to be attached to the bones and form sheaths for the extensor tendons. There are six of these sheaths, the first on the radial side giving passage to the extensor ossis metacarpi and extensor primi internodii pollicis; the second, to the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevier; the third, to the extensor secundi internodii; the fourth, to the extensor indicis and extensor communis digitorum; the fifth, which is placed between the two bones, to the extensor digiti minimi; and the sixth, situated on the ulna, to the extensor carpi ulnaris. The tendons in passing through these sheaths are each provided with a synovial bursa. On the back of the hand there are two fasciae, superficial and deep. The fascia dorsalis superficialis is thin and covers in the extensor tendons; it is attached laterally to the metacarpal bones of the index and little finger, and is continuous above with the posterior annular ligament. The fascia dorsalis profunda is stretched across the metacarpal spaces and covers in the interossei muscles. The palmar fascia is divided into three portions. A central por- tion, which occupies the middle of the palm, and two lateral portions,FASCIA OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 301 whicli are tlim and enclose the muscles of the borders of the hand, being continuous with the dorsal fascia. The central portion is strong and tendinous : it is narrow at the wrist, where it is attached to the annular ligament and receives the insertion of the tendon of the palmaris longus, and broad over the heads of the metacarpal bones, where it divides into four processes, each of which subdivides to embrace the root of the corresponding finger. These processes are attached upon the middle line to the sheath of the tendons, and at the side of each finger to the lateral and transverse ligaments. The fascia is strengthened at its point of division by strong fasciculi of transverse fibres, and the arched interval left between each pair of slips gives passage to the tendons of the flexor muscles. The arches between the fingers transmit the digital vessels and nerves, and lumbricales muscles. FASCIiB OP THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The superficial fascia contains between its two layers the super- ficial vessels and nerves of the lower extremity. At the groin these two layers are separated from each other by the superficial lymphatic glands, and the deep layer is attached to Poupart's ligament, while the superficial layer is continuous with the superficial fascia of the abdomen. The [deejp fascia of the thigh is named, from its great extent, the fascia lata; it is thick and strong upon the outer side of the Hmb, and thinner on its inner and posterior side. That portion of fascia which invests the gluteus maximus is very thin, but that which covers in the gluteus medius is excessively thick, and gives origin, by its inner surface, to the superficial fibres of that muscle. The fascia lata is attached superiorly to Poupart's ligament, the crest of the ilium, sacrum, coccyx, tuberosity of the ischium, ramus of the ischium and pubes, body of the pubes, and pectineal line; it has also a deep attachment (ligamentum iliacum) to the anterior border of the ilium, tendon of origin of the rectus muscle and border of the acetabulum. It forms sheaths for the muscles of the thigh and femoral vessels, and is connected with the linea aspera by means of two intermuscular ligaments, external and internal; the former extending from the insertion of the gluteus maximns to the external condyle, and separating the vastus externus from the biceps muscle; the internal being attached to the inner branch of the linea aspera for a short distance above the internal condyle, and separating the vastus internus from the adductor magnus. The fascia lata receives the attachment of two muscles, the tensor vaginse femoris and gluteus maximus, and glides over the trochanter major on a bursa. Inferiorly it is inserted into the head of the tibia, and forms a bridge across the popliteal space (fovea poplitea), being continuous between its points of attachment with the fascia of the leg.302 FASCIA OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. In addition to tlie smaller openings in tlie fascia lata whicli trans- mit the small cutaneous vessels and nerves, there exists at the upper and inner extremity of the thigh an oval opening (fovea ovalis), which gives passage to the superficial lymphatic vessels, and the large subcutaneous vein of the lower extremity, the internal saphe- nous vein, and is thence named the saphenous opening. The ex- istence of this opening has given rise to the division of the upper part of the fascia lata into two portions, an Uiac portion and a pubic portion. The iliac portion is situated upon the iliac side of the opening. It is attached to the crest of the ilium, and along Poupart's ligament to the spine of the pubes, whence it is reflected downwards and out- wards in an arched direction, and forms a falciform, border, which * Section of the structures which pass beneath the femoral arch. 1.

The edge of this border immediately overlies, and is adherent to, the sheath of the femoral vessels, and the lower extremity of the curve is con- tinuous with the pubic portion. The pubic portion, occupying the pubic side of the saphenous opening, is attached to the spine of the pubes and pectineal line; and, passing outwards behind the sheath of the femoral vessels, divides into two layers ; the anterior layer is continuous with that portion of the iliac fascia which forms the sheath of the iKacus and psoas muscle, the posterior layer is lost upon the capsule of the hip-joint. The interval between the falciform border of the iliac portion and the opposite surface of the pubic portion is closed by a cellulo- fibrous layer, derived from the superficial fascia, and pierced by numerous openings for the passage of lymphatic vessels, the cribn- form fascia (lamina cribrosa). The cribriform fascia is connected with the sheath of the femoral vessels, and forms one of the cover- ings of femoral hernia. When the iliac portion of the fascia lata is removed from its attachment to Poupart's ligament and turned aside, the sheath of the femoral vessels (the femoral or crural canal) is brought into view; and if Poupart's ligament be carefully divided, the sheath may be isolated, and its continuation with the transversalis and iliac fascia demonstrated. In this view the sheath of the femoral vessels is an infundibuliform continuation of the ab- dominal .fascia, closely adherent to the vessels a little way down the thigh, but much larger than the vessels it contains at Poupart's ligament. If the sheath be opened, the artery and vein will be found lying side by side, and occupying the outer two-thirds of the sheath, leaving an infundibuliform interval between the vein and the inner wall of the sheath. The superior opening of this space is named the femoral or crural ring; it is bounded ia front by Pou- part's ligament, behind by the os pubis, internally by Gimbernat's ligament, and externally by the femoral vein. The interval itself serves for the passage of the superficial lymphatic vessels from the saphenous opening to a lymphatic gland, which generally occu- pies the femoral ring, and from thence they proceed into the current of the deep lymphatics. The femoral ring is closed merely by a thin layer of subserous cellular tissue, * which retains the lymphatic gland in its position, and is named septum crurale; and by the peri- toneum. It follows from this description that the femoral ring must be a weak point in the parietes of the abdomen, particularly iii the female, in whom the femoral arch, or space included between Poupart's ligament and the border of the pelvis, is larger than in the male, while the structures which pass through it are smaller. It happens, consequently, that if violent or continued pressure be * This cellular tissue is sometimes very considerably thickened by a deposit of fat within its areolae, and forms a thick stratum over the hernial sac.304 FASCIA OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. made upon the abdominal viscera, a portion of intestine may be forced througb the femoral ring into the inftindibuliform space in the sheath of the femoral vessels, carrying before it the peritoneum and septum crurale,—this constitutes femoral hernia. If the causes which gave rise to the formation of the hernia continue, the intestine, unable to extend further down the sheath, from the close connexion of the latter with the vessels, will, in the next place, be forced forwards through the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, carrying before it two additional coverings, the sheath of the vessels or fascia propria, and the cribriform fascia; and then, curving up- wards over Poupart's ligament, the hernia will become placed beneath the superficial fascia and integument. The direction which femoral hernia takes in its descent is at first downwards, then forivards, and then upwards; and in endeavour- ing to reduce it, the application of the taxis must have reference to this course, and be directed in precisely the reverse order. The coverings of femoral hernia are, the Integument, Fascia propria. Superficial fascia, Septum crurale, Cribriform fascia, Peritoneal sac. The deep fascia of the leg (fascia cruralis) is attached to the inner and outer tuberosity of the tibia and head of the fibula, and receives an accession of fibres from the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis and biceps. Between its points of attachment, and especi- ally behind, it is continuous with the fascia of the thigh. In the front of the leg it encloses the tibialis anticus and extensor muscles, and affords origin to some of their fibres. On the outer side it forms a sheath for the peronei muscles; and behind two sheaths superficial and deep; the former for the gastrocnemius and soleus with the tendo-Achillis; the latter for the deep flexor muscles. At the ankle these four sheaths are differently arranged; the posterior superficial sheath terminates on the os calcis with the tendo-Achillis ; the posterior deep sheath is attached on the one side to the border of the internal malleolus, on the other to the os calcis and inner side of the foot, being blended with the origin of the abductor pollicis. This portion of the deep fascia is the internal annular ligament (laciniatum internum); it sends processes inwards to divide the tendons of the flexors and form sheaths for them in their passage into the foot. The sheath of the peronei muscles at the outer ankle is attached to the external malleolus on one side, and the border of the OS calcis on the other, and forms the external annidar ligament "(laciniatum externum). The anterior portion of the fascia forms at the ankle the anterior annular and the cruciform ligament. The anterior annular ligament (transversum) is a band of transverse fibres about an inch and a half in breadth, situated immediately above the joint, and attached to the tibia and fibula on either side. The cruciformligament (cruciatum) is composed of two bands about305 PLANTER FASCIA. half an inch in width, blended with each other at their point of union on the front of the joint. The internal band is attached above to the internal malleolus and below to the os calcis on the outer side of the foot; the external band to the external malleolus above, and the scaphoid and internal cuneiform bone on the inner border of the foot. The internal band at its origin consists of two layers, between which passes the tendon of the tibialis anticus. The tendons of the ex- tensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius have also a separate loop connected with the cruciform ligament, the sling ligament (fundiforme) of Retzius; this is a narrow band which embraces the tendons in a sling-shaped loop, and passes outwards and backwards to be attached to the sulcus tali and neighbouring part of the calca- neum. The tendons passijDg through the loops and sheaths around the ankle are each furnished with a synovial bursa. That portion of the fascia cruralis which forms a septum between the superficial and deep muscles of the back of the leg is sometimes called the intermuscular fascia; and in operations on the arteries of that region the deep layer of the deep fascia. There is besides another deep portion of fascia, above the preceding, the popliteal fascia, derived from the tendon of the semi-membranosus muscle and binding down the popliteus muscle. By its inferior border this fascia is inserted into the popliteal line of the tibia. The/ascioB dorsales pedis are three in number, superficial, middle, and deep. The fascia dorsalis pedis is thin and covers the dorsum of the foot, being continuous at the ankle with the cruciform ligament, and attached on either side to the borders of the foot, where it becomes united with the plantar fascia. A second or middle layer of fascia is found covering -ia the anterior part of the extensor brevis digi- torum with its tendons; and a third or deep layer is found beneath the latter, and covering in the interossei muscles. On the interossei muscles the three layers are united, and the extensor tendons are consequently separated from each other in their course to the toes. The Plantar fascia consists of three portions, middle and two lateral. The middle portion (fascia plantaris media) is thick and dense, and composed of strong aponeurotic fibres, closely interwoven with each other. It is attached posteriorly to the inferior surface of the tuberosities of the os calcis, and terminates under the heads of the metatarsal bones in five fasciculi. Each of these fasciculi embraces the base of the corresponding toe, and is attached in the middle to the sheath of the flexor tendons, and at either side to the head of the metatarsal bone. The point of division of the fascia into fasciculi is strengthened by transverse bands, which preserve the solidity of the fascia at its broadest part. The intervals between the toes give passage to the digital arteries and nerves and lumbricales muscles. The lateral portions (interna et externa) are thin, and cover the sides of the sole of the foot; they are continuous behind with the in- X306 PLANTAE FASCIA. ternal and external annular ligaments ; and on the mesial side with the central portion. The inner portion is continuous along the border of the foot with the fascia of the dorsum; the outer is attached to the os calcis and base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, forming between these points a thick band, which gives origin to a part of the abductor minimi digiti muscle. Besides constituting a strong layer of investment and defence to the soft parts situated in the sole of the foot, these three portions of fascia send processes inwards, which form sheaths for the different muscles. A strong septum is given ofiT from each side of the middle portion of the plantar fescia, which is attached to the tarsal bones, and divides the muscles into three groiips, a middle and two lateral; and transverse septa are stretched between these to separate the layers. The superficial layer of muscles derive a part of their origin from the plantar fascia.307 CHAPTER V. OF THE ARTERIES. The arteries are the cylindrical tubes which convey the blood from the ventricles of the heart to every part of the body. They are dense in structure, and preserve for the most part the cylindrical form when emptied of their blood, which is their condition after death: hence they were considered by the ancients as the vessels for the transmis- sion of the vital spirits,* and were therefore named arteries (a>)|0 rrjpelv, to contain air). The artery proceeding from the left ventricle of the heart contains the pure or arterial blood, which is distributed throughout the entire system, and constitutes with its returning veins the greater or sys- temic circulation. That which emanates from the right ventricle conveys;the impure blood to the lungs; and with its corresponding veins establishes the lesser or pulmonary circulation. The whole of the arteries of the systemic circulation proceed from a single trunk, named the aorta, from which they are given off as branches, and divide and subdivide to their ultimate ramifications, constituting the great arterial tree which pervades by its minute sub- divisions every part of the animal frame. The mode in which the division into branches takes place is deserving of remark. From the aorta the branches, for the most part, pass off at right angles, as if for the purpose of checking the impetus with which the blood would otherwise rush along the cylinders from the main trunk; but in the limbs a very different arrangement is adopted; the branches are given off from the principal artery at an acute angle, so that no im- pediment may be offered to the free circulation of the vital fluid. The division of arteries is usually dichotomous, as of the aorta into the two common iliacs, common carotid into the external and in- ternal, &c. ; but in some few instances a short trunk divides sud- denly into several branches which proceed in different directions : this mode of division is termed an axis, as the thyroid and coeliac axis. In the division of an artery into two branches, it is observed that the combined arese of the two branches are somewhat greater than that of the single trunk; and if the combined arese of all the branches at the periphery of the body were compared with that of the aorta, * To Galen is due the honour of having discovered that arteries contained blood, and not air. x2GENERAL ANATOMY OP ARTERIES. 308 it would be seen that the blood, in passing from the aorta into the numerous distributing branches, was flowing through a conical space, of which the apex might be represented by the aorta, and the base by the surface of the body. The advantage of this provision in faci- litating the circulation is sufficiently obvious; for the increased channel which is thus provided for the current of the blood, serves to compensate for the retarding influence of friction, resulting from the distance of the heart and the division of the vessels. Communications between arteries are very free and numerous, and increase in frequency with the diminution in size of the branches; so that, through the medium of the minute ramifications, the entire body may be considered as one uninterrupted circle of inosculations, or anastomoses {dva between, crrofia mouth). This increase in the frequency of anastomosis in the smaller branches is a provision for counteracting the greater liability to impediment existing in them than in the larger branches. Where freedom of circulation is of vital importance, this communication of the arteries is very remarkable, as in the circle of Willis in the cranium, or in the distribution of the arteries of the heart. It is also strikingly seen in situations where ob- struction is most likely to occur, as in the distribution to the alimentary canal, around joints, or in the hand and foot. Upon this free com- munication existing everywhere between arterial branches is founded the principle of cure by the ligature of large arteries; the ramifica- tions of the branches given oif from the artery above the ligature inosculate with those which proceed from the trunk of the vessel below the ligature; these anastomosing branches enlarge and consti- tute a collateral circulation, in which, as is shown in the prepara- tions made by Sir Astley Cooper, several large branches perform the office of the single obliterated trunk. * The arteries do not terminate directly in veins; but in an inter- mediate system of vessels, which, from their minute size {about 3 Q of an inch in diameter,) are termed capillaries (capillus, a hair). The capillaries constitute a microscopic network, which is distributed through every part of the body, so as to render it impossible to intro- duce the smallest needle-point beneath the skin without wounding several of these fine vessels. It is through the medium of the capil- laries, that all the phenomena of nutrition and secretion are per- formed. They are remarkable for their uniformity of diameter, and for the constant divisions and communications which take place be- tween them, without any alteration of size. They inosculate on the one hand with the terminal ramusculi of the arteries ; and on the other with the minute radicles of the veins. Arteries are composed of three coats, external, middle, and internal. The external or cellulo-fibrous coat is firm and strong, and serves at the same time as the chief means of resistance of the vessel, and of * I have a preparation, showing the collateral circulation in a dog, in which I tied the abdominal aorta; the animal died from over-feeding nearly two years after the operation.309 STRUCTURE OP ARTERIES. connexion to surrounding parts. It consists of condensed cellulo- fibrous tissue, strengthened by an interlacement of glistening fibres, which are partly longitudinal and partly encircle the cylinder of the tube in an oblique direction. Upon the surface the cellular tissue is loose, to permit of the movements of the artery in distention and contraction. The middle or contractile coat is that upon which the thickness and contractility of the artery depend ; it is yellowish in colour, and brittle, so as to be cut through by the thread in the ligature of a vessel. The internal or serous coat is a thin serous membrane which lines the interior of the artery, and gives it a smooth polished sur- face. It is continuous with the lining membrane of the heart, and through the medium of the capillaries with that of the venous system. In intimate structure an artery is somewhat complicated. The internal coat, for example, is composed of two layers, and the middle of three, so that, with the external coat, there are six layers entering into the composition of an artery. The innermost coat is a tesselated epithelium, analogous to that of other serous membranes. The second coat from within is a thin, rigid membrane, pierced with a number of round or oval-shaped holes, and supporting a thin layer of flat longitudinal fibres. From these characters it has been denominated the fenestrated or striated coat. The third layer, which is the innermost part of the middle coat, is composed of flat, longitudinal fibres, analogous to those of organic muscle. The fourth layer, the thickest of the whole, is composed of muscular fibres of organic life, arranged in a circular direction around the vessel. The fifth, or outermost part of the middle coat, is a thin layer of elastic tissue; this is present only in the large arteries. The sixth is the external or cellulo-fibrous coat. The arteries in their distribution through the body are included in a loose cellulo-fibrous investment, which separates them from surrounding tissues, and is called a sheath. Around the principal vessels the sheath is an important structure ; it is composed of cellulo-fibrous tissue, intermingled with tendinous fibres, and is continuous with the fascia of the region in which the arteries are situated, as with the thoracic and cervical fascia in the neck, trans- versalis and Uiac fascia, fascia lata in the thigh, &c. The sheath of the arteries contains also their accompanying veins, and sometimes a nerve. The coats of arteries are supplied with blood like other organs of the body, and the vessels distributed to them are named vasa vasorum. They are also provided with nerves; but the mode of distribution of the nerves is at present unknown. In the consideration of the arteries, we shall first describe the aorta, and the branches of that trunk with their subdivisions, which together constitute the efferent portion of the systemic circulation;310 AORTA. and tlien the pulmonary artery as the efferent trunk of the pulmonary circulation. AORTA. The Aorta arises from the left ventricle, at the middle of the root of the heart, and presents at its commencement an enlargement (bulbus aortas) caused by three dilatations of the walls of the vessel, the sinus aortici (sinus Valsalvas) and corresponding with the three semilunar valves. It ascends at first forwards and to the right, then curves backwards and to the left, and descends on the left side of the vertebral column to the fourth lumbar vertebra. Hence it is divided into the arch and descending aorta. The Arch op the aorta (arcus aortse), commencing at a point corresponding with the articulation of the cartilage of the fourth rib with the sternum on the left side, crosses behind and near the sternum to a point corresponding with the upper border of the arti- culation of the second rib with the sternum on the right side. It then curves backwards and to the left, and descends to the left side of the body of the third dorsal vertebra, and at the lower border of the latter vertebra becomes the thoracic aorta. The first or ascending portion of the arch (aorta ascendens), a little more than two inches in length, is almost wholly contained within the pericardium. It is crossed in front by the pulmonary artery; on its left side it has the left auricle and pulmonary artery; on its right the right auricle and superior vena ca-va; and behind the right pulmonary artery and veins. The second or transverse portion of the arch is crossed in front hj the left phrenic nerve, left nervus superficialis cordis, left inferior cardiac of the pneumogastric, and left pneumogastric nerve. Behind it is in relation with the trachea, oesophagus, thoracic duct, the nerves to the deep cardiac plexus, and the left recurrent nerve. Above it gives off the arteria innominata, left carotid and left subclavian artery, and supports the left vena innominata ; and below is in relation with the superficial cardiac plexus, the bifurca- tion of the pulmonary artery, cord of the ductus arteriosus, left bronchus, and left recurrent nerve. The third or descending portion of the arch lies against the third dorsal vertebra, and is partially covered by the left pleura. Aorta descenders. —The descending aorta is subdivided in cor- respondence with the two great cavities of the trunk, into the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Aorta thoracica.—The thoracic aorta commencing at the lower border and left side of the third dorsal vertebra curves gently towards the right as it descends, and as it passes through the aortic opening of the diaphragm lies \ipon the middle line of the vertebral column. It is in relation behind, with the vertebral column and lesser vena azygos; in front, with the oesophagus and right pneumogastric311 * The large vessels which proceed from the root of the heart, with their relations; the heart has been removed. 1.

Aorta abdominalis.—The abdominal aorta enters the abdomen through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, and between the two pillars of that muscle. In its course downwards, it lies on the left of the vertebral column, and terminates on the fourth lumbar vertebra by dividing into the two common iliac arteries. It is crossed by the left renal vein, pancreas, transverse duodenum, and mesentery, and is in relation behind with the thoracic duct, recep- ta<?ulum chyli, and left lumbar veins. On its left side is situated the left semilunar ganglion and sympathetic nerve, and on its right, the inferior vena cava, right semilunar ganglion, and the commencement of the vena azygos.

The Coronary arteries (cardiacas) arise from tlie aortic sinuses at the commencement of the ascending portion of the arch of the aorta, immediately above the free margin of the semilunar valves. The left coronary (coronaria cordis sinistra) passes forwards, between the pulmonary artery and left appendix auriculge, and divides into two branches; one of which winds around the base of the left ventricle in the auriculo-ventricular groove, and inosculates with the right coronary, forming an arterial circle around the base of the heart; while the other passes along the line of union of the two ventricles, upon the anterior aspect of the heart, to its apex, where it anastomoses with the descending branch of the right coronary. It supplies the left auricle and the anterior surface of both ventricles. The right coronary (coronaria cordis dextra) passes forwards, between the root of the pulmonary artery and the right auricle, and winds along the auriculo-ventricular groove, to the posterior longitu- dinal furrow, where it descends upon the posterior aspect of the heart to its apex, and inosculates with the left coronary. It is dis- tributed to the right auricle, and to the posterior surface of both ventricles, and sends a large branch along the sharp margin of the right ventricle to the apex of the heart. ARTERIA rroOMINATA. The Arteria innominata (fig. 134, No. 4) is the first and largest artery given off by the arch of the aorta. It is an inch and a half in length, and ascends obliquely towards the right sterno-clavicular articulation, where it divides into the right carotid and right sub- clavian artery. Relations.—It is in relation, in front, with the left vena innomi- nata, the sternum, and origin of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles : behind, with the trachea and right pneumogastric nerve; to the right it has the right vena innominata and pleura; and to the left, the left common carotid artery and the remains of the thymus gland.

This branch was described by Neubaiier, as the thyi'oidea ima (lowest thyroid artery), and Dr. Harrison names it the middle thyroid artery. A knowledge of its existence is important in performing the operation of tracheotomy. COMMON CAROTID ARTERIES. The common carotid arteries (carotis communis vel primitiva; Kocpa, the head) arise, the right from the bifurcation of the arteria innominata opposite the right sterno-clavicular articulation, the left from the arch of the aorta. It follows, therefore, that the right carotid is shorter than the left; it is also more anterior; and, in consequence of proceeding from a branch instead of from the main trunk, is larger than its fellow. The Right common carotid artery (fig, 134, No. 5) ascends the neck perpendicularly by the side of the trachea and larynx, from the right sterno-clavicular articulation to a level with the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, where it divides into the external carotid and internal carotid. The Left common carotid (fig. 134, No. 11) passes somewhat ob- liquely outwards from the arch of the aorta to the side of the neck, and thence upwards to a level with the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, where it divides like the right common carotid into the external carotid and internal carotid. Relations.—The common carotid artery, in the neck, is enclosed in a fibrous sheath, which also contains the internal jugular vein, lying to the outer side of the artery; and the pneumogastric nerve, which Kes between and behind both. The sheath rests upon the vertebral column, having interposed the sympathetic nerve and the muscles of the anterior surface of the vertebral column, namely, the longus colli and rectus anticus major; and being crossed behind by the inferior thyroid artery and recurrent laryngeal nerve. To the inner side of the carotid is the trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, and larynx; to its outer side, and enclosed in its sheath, the jugular vein and pneumogastric nerve; and i7i front, the sterno-thyroid, stemo-hyoid, sterno-mastoid, omo-hyoid, and platysma muscles, and the descendens noni nerve. The left common carotid, in addition to the relations just enumerated, which are common to both, is crossed near its commencement by the left vena innominata, and supports the remains of the thymus gland; it lies upon the trachea; then gets to its side, and is in relation with the oesophagus and thoracic duct: to facilitate the study of these relations, I have arranged them in a tabular form.EXTEKNAL OAEOTID ARTERY. 315 Plan of Relations of the Common Carotid Artery.

EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. The External carotid artery (carotis erterna) ascends nearly perpendicularly from opposite the upper border of the thyroid carti- lage, to the space between the neck of the lower jaw and the meatus auditorius, where it divides into two terminal branches, the temporal and internal maxillary. Relations.—In front it is crossed by the posterior belly of the digastricus, stylo-hyoideus, and platysma myoides; by the hypo- glossal nerve near its origin; higher up it is situated in the substance of the parotid gland, and has in front the facial nerve and tempore- maxillary vein. BeJdnd, it is separated from the internal carotid by the stylo-pharyngeus and stylo-glossus muscle, glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and part of the parotid gland.

Branches, —The brandies of the external carotid, ten in number, may be arranged into three groups, anterior, posterior, and ascend- ing. They are as follow : Anterior. Posterior. Superior thyroid, Sterno-mastoid, Lingual, Occipital, Facial. Posterior auricular. Ascendvng. Ascending pharyngeal, Temporal, Parotidean, Internal maxillary. The anterior branches arise from the commencement of the ex- ternal carotid, within a short distance of each other. The lingual and facial bifurcate, not unfrequently, from a common trunk. The Superior thyroid artery (thyroidea superior) the first of the branches of the external carotid, arises from that trunk just below the great comu of the os hyoides, and curves downwards to the thyroid gland. It is distributed by several large branches (rami thyroidei) to the anterior part of the gland, and anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the inferior thyroid arteries. In its course it passes beneath the omo-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and sterno-hyoid muscles. Branches.—Hyoid, Inferior laryngeal, Superior laryngeal, Muscular. The Hyoid branch passes forwards beneath the thyro-hyoideus, and is distributed to the depressor muscles of the os hyoides near their insertion. The Superior la/ryngeal (laryngea superior) pierces the thyro- hyoidean membrane. La company with the superior laryngeal nerve, and supplies the mucous membrane and muscles of the larynx, send- ing a branch upwards to the epiglottis. The Inferior laryngeal (crico-thyroidea) is a small branch which crosses the crico-thyroidean membrane along the lower border of the thyroid cartilage. It sends branches through that membrane to supply the mucous lining of the larynx, and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side. The Muscular branches (rami musculares) are distributed to the depressor muscles of the os hyoides and larynx. One of these branches crosses the sheath of the common carotid to the under surface of the sterno-mastoid muscle. The liLNGtJAL ARTERY (lingualis) ascends obliquely from its origin; it then passes forwards parallel with the great cornu of the osLINGUAL ARTERY. 317 kyoides; thirdly, it ascends to the under surface of the tongue ; and fourthly, it runs forward in a serpentine direction to its tip, under the name of ranine artery (profunda Unguse), where it termi- nates by inosculating with its fellow of the opposite side. Relations.—The first part of its course rests on the middle Fig. 135.* constrictor muscle of the pharynx, being covered in by the tendon of the digastricus and the stylo-hyoid muscle; the second is situated between the middle constrictor and hyo-glossus muscle, the latter separating it from the hypoglossal neiwe; in the third part of its course it lies between the hyo-glossus and genio-hyo-glossus; and * Carotid arteries with, the branches of the external carotid. 1.

The DorsaUs linguce ascends along the posterior border of the liyo-glossus muscle to the dorsum of the tongue, and is distributed to the tongue, the fauces, and epiglottis; anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side. The Sublingual branch (sublingualis) runs forwards on the genio- hyo-glossus muscle, and is distributed to the sublingual gland and muscles of the tongue. It is situated between the mylo- hyoideus and genio-hyo-glossus, generally accompanies Wharton's duct for a part of its course, and sends a branch to the frsenum linguge. It is the latter branch which affords the considerable hsemorrhage sometimes following the operation of snipping the fraenum in children. Facial artery.—The facial artery (maxillaris externa; labialis) arises immediately above the lingual and a little above the great comu of the os hyoides, and passes forwards to the submaxillary gland, in which it lies embedded. It then curves around the body of the lower jaw, close to the anterior inferior angle of the masseter muscle, ascends to the angle of the mouth, and thence to the angle of the eye, where it is named the angular artery. The facial artery is tortuous in its course over the buccinator muscle, to accommodate itself to the movements of the jaws. Relations.—Below the jaw it passes beneath the digastricus and stylo-hyoid muscles; on the body of the lower jaw it is covered by the platysma myoides, and at the angle of the mouth by the de- pressor anguli oris and zygomatic muscles. It rests upon the sub- maxillary gland, lower jaw, buccinator, orbicularis oris, levator anguli oris, levator labii superioris proprius, and levator labii supe- rioris algeque nasi. Its branches miay be grouped into those which are given off below the jaw, and those on the face; they may be thus arranged:— tongue. Branches. —Hyoid, Dorsalis linguse, Sublingual. Below the Jaw. On the Face. Inferior palatine, Tonsillar, Submaxillary, Submental, Muscular. Buccal, Inferior labial. Inferior coronary, Superior coronary. Lateralis nasi.319 FACIAL ARTEKT. The Inferior palatine branch (palatina ascendens; pharyngo- palatina) ascends between tlie stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscle, to be distributed to the tonsil and soft palate, and anasto- moses with the descending palatine branch of the internal maxillary artery. The Tonsillar branch (tonsillaris) ascends upon the side of the pharynx, and pierces the superior constrictor muscle to be distributed to the tonsil. The Submaxillary (submaxillares) are four or five branches which supply the submaxillary gland. The Submental branch (submentalis) runs forwards upon the mylo-hyoid muscle, under cover of the body of the lower jaw, and anastomoses with branches of the sublingual and inferior dental artery. The Muscular branches (musculares) are distributed to the mas- seter, pterygoideus internus, digastricus and stylo-hyoideus. The Buccal branches (buccales), eight or ten in number, are given off upon the face, and are distributed to the buccinator, mas- seter, muscles of the upper lip, orbicularis palpebrarum, and in- tegument of the cheek. They anastomose with the b^iccal branch of the internal maxillary, the transverse facial, and the infraorbital. The Inferior labial branch (labialis inferior) passes forwards be- neath the depressor anguli oris muscle, and is distributed to the muscles of the lower lip, inosculating with the labial branch of the inferior dental, and with the inferior coronary. The Inferior coronary branch (coronaria labii inferioris) is given off at the angle of the mouth, and passes inwards near the edge of the lower lip, lying between the orbicularis and mucous membrane : it inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side. The Superior coronary branch (coronaria labii superioris), arising close to, or in common with the preceding, takes its course in the same manner along the upper lip, inosculating with its fellow of the opposite side. At the middle of the lip it sends a small branch up- wards to the septum of the nose (arteria septi). The Lateral nasal branch (nasalis lateralis vel externa) is given off near the ala nasi, and passes beneath the levator labii superioris alseque nasi, to be distributed to the nose. It inosculates with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery. The Inosculations of the facial artery are numerous, namely, with the sublingual branch of the lingual, ascending pharyngeal artery, descending palatine artery, inferior dental at its escape from the mentaJ foramen, infraorbital at the infraorbital foramen, transverse facial on the side of the face, and at the angle of the eye, the nasal and frontal branch of the ophthalmic artery. The facial artery is subject to variety in length : it not unfrequently terminates at the angle of the nose or mouth, and is rarely sym- metrical on both sides of the face.320 STERNO-MASTOID.—ASCENDING PHAEYNGEAL. The Sterno-mastoid artery txims downwards from its origin, to be distributed to the sterno-mastoid muscle, and lymphatic glands of the neck; sometimes there are two branches. The Occipital artery (occipitalis), smaller than the anterior branches, passes backwards behind the parotid gland and beneath the posterior belly of the digastricns, trachelo-mastoideus, and sterno-mastoideus to the occipital groove in the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. It then ascends between the splenius and com- plexns, pierces the trapezius, and is distributed to the back of the head (ramus occipitalis), anastomosing with the opposite occipital, the posterior auricular, and temporal artery. The hypoglossal nerve curves around this artery opposite the angle of the jaw and near its origin from the external carotid. Branches.—It gives off several muscular branches (cervicales) to the sterno-mastoideus, digastricus, stylo-hyoideus, and deep muscles in its course, a small branch to the external ear, and two larger branches, the inferior meningeal and princeps cervicis. The Inferior meningeal ascends by the side of the internal jugular vein, and passes through the foramen lacerum posterius, to be dis- tributed to the dura mater. The Arteria princeps cervicis (cervicalis profundus superior) is a large and irregular branch. It descends the neck between the com- plexus and semi-spinalis colli, and inosculates with the profunda cervicis of the subclavian and branches of the vertebral. This branch is the means of establishing a very important collateral circulation between the branches of the carotid and subclavian, after ligature of the common carotid artery. The Posterior auricular artery (auricularis posterior) arises from the external carotid, above the level of the digastricus and stylo-hyoideus muscle, and ascends by the side of the styloid process and behind the parotid gland, to the back part of the concha. It is distributed by two branches to the external ear (ramus auricularis) and side of the head (ramus occipitalis), anastomosing with the occipital and temporal artery; some of its branches pass through fissures in the fibro-cartilage, to reach the anterior surface of the pinna. The anterior auricular arteries are branches of the temporal. Branches.—The posterior auricular gives off a branch to the digastricus muscle, and several branches to the parotid gland; it then gives off the stylo-mastoidea, which enters the stylo-mastoid foramen to be distributed to the aquseductus Fallopii, labyrinth, mastoid cells, and tympanum; a twig accompanies the chorda tym- pani under the name of tympanica superior. The Ascending pharyngeal artery (pharyngea ascendens), the smallest of the branches of the external carotid, arises from that trunk near its bifurcation, and ascends between the internal carotidPAKOTIDEAN:—TEMPORAL. 321 and the side of the pharynx to the base of the skull, where it di- vides into two branches; meningeal (meningea posterior), which enters the foramen lacerum posterius, to be distributed to the dura mater; and pharyngeal. It supplies the pharynx, tonsils, soft palate, and Eustachian tube. The Parotidean arteries (parotidese) are four or five large branches which are given off from the external carotid whilst that vessel is situated in the parotid gland. They are distributed to the structure of the gland, their terminal branches reaching the integu- ment of the side of the face, and masseter muscle (r. masseteric! posteriores). The Temporal Artery (temporalis) is one of the two terminal branches of the external carotid. It ascends over the root of the zygoma ; and, at about an inch and a half above the zygomatic arch, divides into an anterior and a posterior temporal branch. The anterior temporal (temporalis superficialis anterior, vel frontalis) is distributed over the front of the temple and arch of the skull, and anastomoses with the opposite anterior temporal, and with the supraorbital and frontal artery. The posterior temporal (tempo- ralis superficialis posterior, vel occipitalis) curves upwards and backwards, and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side, with the posterior auricular and occipital artery. The trunk of the temporal artery is covered by the parotid gland and by the attrahens aurem muscle, and rests on the temporal fascia. The Branches of the temporal artery are, some small ofi'sets to the parotid gland and articulation of the lower jaw, and the following: Anterior auricular, Transversa faciei. Orbital, Middle temporal. The Anterior auricular branches (auriculares anteriores), two in number, are distributed to the anterior portion of the pinna. The Orbital branch (zygomatico-orbitalis; supra-orbitalis ex- terna) passes forward immediately above the zygoma, between the two layers of the temporal fascia, and inosculates beneath the orbicularis palpebrarum with the lachrymal branch of the oph- thalmic artery. The Transversa faciei arises from the temporal immediately below the zygoma, and runs transversely across the face, resting on the masseter muscle, and lying parallel with and a little above Stenon's duct. It anastomoses with the facial and infraorbital artery. The Middle temporal branch (temporalis media) passes through an opening in the temporal fascia immediately above the zygoma, and supplies the temporal muscle inosculating with the deep tem- poral arteries. YINTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. 322 The Internal maxillary artery (maxillaris interna), the other terminal branch of the external carotid, has next to be examined. Dissection.—The Internal maxillary artery passes inwards behind the neck of the lower jaw to the deep structures in the face ; we require, therefore, to remove several parts for the purpose of seeing it completely. To obtain a good view of the vessel, the zygoma should be sawn across in front of the external ear, and the malar bone near the orbit. Turn down the zygomatic arch with the masseter muscle. In doing this, a small artery and nerve will be seen crossing the sigmoid notch of the lower jaw, and entering the masseter muscle (masseteric). Gut away the tendon of the tem- poral muscle from its insertion into the coronoid process, and turn it upwards towards its origin ; some vessels will be seen entering its under surface ; these are the deep temporal. Then saw the ramus of the jaw across its middle, and dislocate it from its articulation with the temporal bone. Be careful in doing this to carry the blade of the knife close to the bone, lest any branches of nerves should be injured. Next raise this portion of bone, and with it the external pterygoid muscle. The artery, together with the deep branches of the inferior maxillary nerve, will be seen lying on the pterygoid muscles. These are to be carefully freed from fat and cellular tissue, and then examined. The internal maxillary artery commences in the substance of the parotid gland, opposite the meatus auditorius extemus ; it passes in the first instance horizontally forward behind the neck of the lower jaw ; next, curves around the lower border of the external pterygoid muscle near its insertion, and ascends obliquely forwards upon the outer side of that muscle; it then passes between the two heads of the external pterygoid, and enters the spheno-maxillary fossa. Occasion- ally it passes between the two pterygoid muscles, without appearing on the outer surface of the external pterygoid. In consideration of its course, this artery may be divided into three portions: maxillary, pterygoid, and spheno-maxillary. Relations.—The maxillary portion is situated between the neck of the jaw and the internal lateral ligament and inferior dental nerve, and lies parallel with the auriculo-temporal nerve ; the pterygoid portion between the external pterygoid muscle, and the masseter and temporal muscle. The spheno-maxillary portion lies between the two heads of the external pterygoid muscle, and, in the spheno-maxillary fossa, is in relation with Meckel's ganglion. Branches.—Maxillary Portion. Pterygoid Portion. Tympanic, Inferior dental, Arteria meningea media, Arteria meningea parva. Deep temporal, Pterygoid, Masseteric, Buccal.323 INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. Spheno-maxillary Portion. Superior dental, Spheno-palatine, Infra-orbitalis, Superior palatine, Pterygo-palatine, Vidian. The Tympanic branch (arteria cavi tympani) passes into the tympanum through the fissura Grlaseri, and is distributed to the laxator tympani, and membrana tympani; on the latter it inoscu- lates with the stylo-mastoid artery. The Inferior dental (maxillaris vel alveolaris inferior) descends to the dental foramen, and enters the canal of the lower jaw in com- pany with the dental nerve. Opposite the bicuspid teeth it divides into two branches, one of which is continued onwards within the bone as far as the symphysis, to supply the incisor teeth, while the other (a. mentalis) escapes with the nerve at the mental foramen, and anastomoses with the inferior labial and submental branch of the facial. It supplies the alveoli (r. alveolares) and teeth of the lower jaw, sending small branches along the canals in their roots. At the inferior dental foramen, it gives off a mylo-hyoicl branch, which accompanies the mylo-hyoidean nerve. The Arteria meningea media ascends behind the temporo- maxillary articulation to the foramen spinosum in the spinous pro- cess of the sphenoid bone, and entering the cranium, divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch crosses the great' ala of the sphenoid to the groove or canal in the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, and divides into branches which ramify upon the external surface of the dura mater, and anastomose with,corresponding branches from the opposite side. The posterior branch crosses the squamous portion of the temporal bone, to the posterior part of the dura mater and cranium. The branches of the arteria meningea media are distributed chiefly to the bones of the skull; in the middle fossa it sends a small petrosal branch through the hiatus Fallopii to the facial nerve, and branches to the Casserian ganglion. The Meningea parva is a small branch which ascends to the foramen ovale, and passes into the skull to be distributed to the Casserian ganglion and dura mater. It gives off a twig to the nasal fossse and soft palate. The Muscular branches (musculares) are distributed, as their names imply, to the five muscles of the maxillary region ; the temporal branches (temporales profundae) are two in number ; they inosculate with branches of the superficial temporal. The pterygoid branches are distributed to both the muscles of that name. The masseteric artery passes outwards, behind the tendon of the tem- poral muscle and over the sigmoid notch, to the masseter muscle. The buccal branch, arising over the anterior part of the pterygoid muscle, passes downwards with the buccal nerve to the buccinator muscle. It inosculates with the facial and transverse facial artery. Y 2324 INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY, The Superior dental artery (supramaxillaris vel alveolaris supe- rior) is given off from the internal maxillary, just as that vessel is alDOut to make its turn inwards to reach the spheno-maxillary fossa. It descends upon the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, and sends its branches through several small foramina to sup- ply the posterior teeth of the upper jaw, and the antrum. The terminal branches are continued forwards upon the alveolar process, to be distributed to the gums and sockets of the teeth. The Tnfraorhitalis would appear, from its size, to be the proper continuation of the artery. It runs along the infraorbital canal with the superior maxillary nerve, sending branches upwards into the orbit, and downwards, thiwgh canals in the bone, to supply the mucous membrane of the antrum and the teeth of the upper jaw, and emerges on the face at the infraorbital foramen. The branch which supplies the incisor teeth is the anterior dental artery ; on the face the infraorbital inosculates with the facial and transverse facial artery. The Pterygo-palatine (pharyngea suprema vel descendens) is a smaU branch M^hich passes backwards through the pterygo-palatine canal, and supplies the mucous membrane of the posterior part of the nares, upper part of the pharynx, Eustachian tube, and sphe- noidal cells. The Spheno-palatine, or posterior nasal (nasaUs posterior ; spheno-palatina), enters the superior meatus of the nose through the spheno-palatine foramen, in company with the nasal filaments of Meckel's ganglion, and divides into two branches ; one branch, arteria septi, is distributed to the mucous membrane of the septum, and inosculates in the anterior palatine canal with the terminal branch of the descending palatine ; the other, nasalis posterior externa, supplies the mucous membrane of lateral wall of the nares, the antrum, and the sphenoid and ethmoid cells. The Superior or descending palatine artery (palatraa superior vel descendens) descends along the posterior palatine canal, in com- pany with the palatine branches of jMeckel's ganglion, to the poste- rior palatine foramen ; it then bends forward, lying in a groove of the bone, and is distributed to the palate. While in the posterior palatine canal it sends several twigs backwards through the small posterior palatine foramina to supply the soft palate, and anteriorly it distributes a branch, ^^aZa/Mza anterior, to the anterior palatine canal, which reaches the nares and inosculates with the arteria septi. The Vidian or pter^/goid hranch passes backwards along the pterygoid canal, and is distributed to the sheath of the Vidian nerve, the Eustachian tube, and mucous membrane of the upper part of the pharynx.325 INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. The internal carotid artery (carotis interna) curves slightly out- wards from the bifurcation of the common carotid, and ascends nearly perpendicularly by the side of the pharynx, to the carotid foramen in the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It next passes inwards, along the carotid canal, forwards by the side of the sella turcica, and upwards by the anterior clinoid process, where it pierces the dura mater, and divides into three terminal branches. The course of this artery is remarkable for the number of angular curves which it forms ; one or two of these flexures are sometimes seen in the cervical portion, near the base of the skull; and, by the side of the sella turcica, it resembles the italic letter s, placed horizontally. Relations.—In consideration of its connexions, the artery is divisible into a cervical, petrous, cavernous, and cerebral portion. The Cervical portion is in relation posteriorly with the rectus anticus major, superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and pharyngeal and superior laryngeal nerve which cross behind it. Internally it is in relation with the side of the pharynx, tonsil, and ascending pharyngeal artery. Externally with the internal jugular vein, glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and hypoglossal nerve; and in front with the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscle, stylo-hyoid ligament, glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and parotid gland.

The Petrous portion is separated from the bony wall of the carotid canal by a periosteal lining derived from the dura mater; it is in relation with the carotid plexus, and is covered in by the Casserian ganglion. The Cavernous portion is situated in the outer wall of the ca- vernous sinus, and is in relation by its inner side with the lining326 OPHTHALMIC ARTERY. membrane of the sinns, and by its outer side with the third, fourth, ophthalmic, and sixth nerve. The Cerebral portion of the artery is enclosed in a sheath of the arachnoid, and is in relation with the optic nerve. At its point of division it is situated in the fissure of Sylvius. Branches.—The cervical portion of the internal carotid gives off no branches : from the other portions are derived the following : - Tympanic, Middle cerebral, Arterise receptaculi, Posterior communicating, Ophthalmic, Choroidea anterior. Anterior cerebral, "The Tympanic is a small branch given off in the carotid canal; it enters the tympanum and inosculates with the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary, and with the stylo-mastoid artery. The ArtericB receptaculi anterior and posterior are two small branches given off in the cavernous sinus and distributed to the parts contained in the cavernous sinus, Casserian ganglion, and dura mater ; one of the twigs distributed to the latter is the ante- rior meningeal artery. The Ophthalmic artery (ophthalmica) arises from the internal carotid, just as that vessel pierces the dura mater, and enters the orbit through the foramen opticum, lying externally to the optic nerve. It then crosses the optic nerve to the inner wall of the orbit, and runs along the lower border of the superior oblique muscle, to the inner angle of the eye, where it divides into two terminal branches, the frontal and nasal. Branches.-—The branches of the ophthalmic artery, ten in number, may be arranged into two groups : first, those distributed to the orbit and surrounding parts ; and, secondly, those which supply the muscles and globe of the eye. They are— Anterior ethmoidal, Palpebral, Frontal, Nasal. The Lachrymal (lachrymalis) is the first branch of the ophthal- mic artery, and is usually given off immediately before that artery enters the optic foramen. It follows the course of ti e lachrymal nerve, above the upper border of the external rectus muscle, and is distributed to the lachrymal gland. The small branches which escape from the gland supply the conjunctiva and upper eyelid. The lachrymal artery gives off a malar branch which passes through First Group.

The Siq^raorbital artery (supraorbitalis) follows the course of the frontal nerve, resting on the levator palpebrse muscle ; it passes through the supraorbital foramen, and divides into a superficial and deep branch, which are distributed to the muscles and integu- ment of the forehead, and to the pericranium. At the supraorbital foramen it sends a branch inwards to the diploe. The Ethmoidal arteries (ethmoidales) posterior and anterior, pass through the ethmoidal foramina, and are distributed to the falx cerebri and to the ethmoidal cells and nasal fossse. The latter accompanies the nasal nerve, and sends a branch to the frontal sinus. The Palpebral arteries (palpebrales), superior and inferior, are given off from the ophthalmic, near the inner angle of the orbit; they encircle the eyelids, forming a superior and an inferior arch (arcus tarseus superior et inferior) near the borders of the lids, between the orbicularis palpebirarum and tarsal cartilage. At the outer angle of the eyelids, the superior palpebral inosculates with the orbital branch of the temporal artery. The inferior palpebral artery sends a branch to the nasal duct. The Frontal artery (frontalis), one of the terminal branches of the ophthalmic, emerges from the orbit at its inner angle, and ascends along the middle of the forehead. It is distributed to the integument, muscles, and pericranium. The Nasal artery (nasalis vel dorsalis nasi), the other terminal branch of the ophthalmic, passes out of the orbit above the tendo oculi, and divides into two branches ; one of which (angularis) inos- culates with the angular artery, while the other, dorsalis nasi, runs along the ridge of the nose, and is distributed to the integu- ment of that organ. The nasal artery sends a small branch to the lachrymal sac. The Muscular branches (rami musculares), usually two in number, superior and inferior, supply the muscles of the orbit: and upon the anterior aspect of the globe of the eye give off the anterior ciliary arteries, which pierce the sclerotic near its margin of connexion with the cornea, and are distributed to the iris. It is the congestion of these vessels that gives rise to the vascular zone around the cornea in iritis. The Ciliary arteries (ciliares) are divisible into three groups, short, long, and anterior. The Short ciliary (ciliares posticee breves), from ten to fifteen in number, pierce the sclerotic around the entrance of the optic nerve, and supply the choroid coat and ciliary processes. The long ciliary (ciliares posticse longse), two in number, pierce the sclerotic on opposite sides of the globe of the eye, and pass for- ward between it and the choroid, to the iris. They form anSUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 328 arterial circle around the circumference of tlie iris by inosculating with each other, and from this circle branches are given off which ramify in the substance of the iris, and form a second circle around the pupil. The anterior ciliary (ciliares anteriores), six to twelve in number, are branches of the muscular arteries; they terminate in the great arterial circle of the iris. The Centralis retince artery pierces the optic nerve obliquely, and passes forwards in the centre of its cylinder to the retina, where it divides into branches, which ramify in the inner layer of that membrane. It supplies the retina, hyaloid membrane, and zonula ciliaris ; and, by means of a branch sent forwards through the centre of the vitreous humour in a tubular sheath of the hyaloid mem- brane, the capsule of the lens. The Anterior cerebral artery (cerebri anterior vel corporis callosi) passes forwards in the great longitudinal fissure between the two hemispheres of the brain; then curves backwards along the corpus callosum to its posterior extremity. It gives branches to the olfactory and optic nerves, to the under surface of the anterior lobes, the third ventricle, the corpus callosum, and the inner surface of the hemispheres. The two anterior cerebral arteries are connected soon after their origin by a short anastomosing trunk, the anterior communicating artery (communicans anterior). The Middle cerebral artery (cerebri media vel fossse Sylvii) larger than the preceding, passes outwards along the fissure of Sylvius, and divides into three principal branches, which supply the anterior and middle lobes of the brain, and the island of Reil. Near its origin it gives off the numerous small branches which enter the substantia perforata, to be distributed to the corpus striatum. The Posterior communicating artery (communicans posterior), very variable in size, sometimes double, and sometimes altogether absent, passes backwards and inosculates with the posterior cere- bral, a branch of the basilar artery. Occasionally it is so large as to take the place of the posterior cerebral artery. The Choroidea anterior is a small branch which is given off from the internal carotid, near the origin of the posterior communicating artery, and passes beneath the edge of the middle lobe of the brain to enter the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. It is distri- buted to the choroid plexus, and to the walls of the middle cornu. SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. The Subclavian artery (subclavia) on the right side, arises from the arteria innominata, opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation, and on the left from the arch of the aorta. The right is consequently shorter than the left, and is situated nearer the anterior wall of the chest; it is also somewhat greater in diameter, from being a branch of a branch, in place of a division from the main trunk. The course of the subclavian artery is divisible, for the sake of precision and surgical observation, into three portions. The firstSUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 329 portion of the right aud left arteries differs in its course and rela- .tions in correspondence with the dissimilarity of origin above referred to. The other two portions are precisely alike on both sides. first portion, on the right side, ascends obliquely outwards to the inner border of the scalenus anticus. On the left side it ascends perpendicularly to the inner border of that muscle. The second portion curves outwards behind the scalenus anticus; and the third portion passes downwards ■ and outwards beneath the clavicle, to the lower border of the first rib, where it becomes the axillary artery. Relations.—Hhe first portion, on the right side, is in relation, in front, with the internal jugular and vertebral vein, and is crossed by the pneumogastric nerve, phrenic nerve, and one or two branches of the sympathetic. Behind and beneath it is invested by the pleura, is crossed by the right recun-ent laryngeal nerve, and is in relation farther back with the sympathetic nerve, longus colli muscle, and transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. The first por- tion on the left side is in relation in front with the pleura, internal jugular vein, vena innominata, and the pneumogastric and phrenic nerve (which lie parallel to it). To its inner side is the left carotid artery, trachea, oesophagus and thoracic duct; to its outer side the pleura; and behind, the oesophagus, thoracic duct, longus colli, and vqrtebral column.

The scalenus anticus separates it from the phrenic nerve and subclavian vein, which latter is rather below the level of the artery. The third portion of the artery is situated in the subclavian triangle, and is more superficial than the rest. In front it is covered by the integument, platysma, and deep fascia, and crossed by the supraclavicular nerves. Lower down it is crossed by the suprascapular artery and vein, and gets behind the subclavius muscle and clavicle. Behind, it has the scalenus medius; above, the brachial plexus ; and below, the first rib and subclavian vein. Plan of the Relations of the third portion of the Subclavian Artery. Above. Brachial plexus. In Front. Integument, Platysma, Deep fascia, Supraclayicular nerves, Suprascapular vessels. Clavicle, Subclavius. Below. First rib, Subclavian vein. Branches.—The branches of the subclavian artery are four, and sometimes fiv^e in number. Three are given off from the first por- tion of the artery ; one, the superior intercostal, from the second portion; and when a fifth artery exists, it arises from the third portion, and is the suprascapular. In a tabular form the branches are as follow: Vertebral, Internal mammary, ( Inferior thyroid, Thyroid axis < Suprascapular, ( Transversa colli. Superior intercostal,—Cervicalis profunda. The Vertebral Artery (vertebralis), the first and largest of the branches of the subclavian artery, arises from the posterior aspect of that trunk ; it ascends through the foramina in the transverse pro- cesses of all the cervical vertebrae, excepting the last; then winds backwards around the articulating process of the atlas; and piercing the dura mater, enters the skull through the foramen magnum. The two arteries unite at the lower border of the pons Varolii, to form the basilar artery. In the foramina of the transverse pro- Subclavian artery. Third portion. Behind.

Dr. John Davy* has observed, that when the vertebral arteries differ in size, the left is generally the larger ; thus in ninety-eight cases he found the left vertebral the larger twenty-six times, and the right only eight. In the same number of cases he found a small band stretching across the cylinder of the basilar artery, near the junction of the two vertebral arteries, seventeen times, and in a few instances a small communicating trunk between the two ver- tebral arteries previously to their union. I have several times seen this communicating branch. The Basilar artery (basilaris, meso-cephalica), so named from its position at the base of the brain, runs forward in the groove on the midline of the pons Varolii, and at the anterior border of the pons divides into four ultimate branches, two to either side. Branches.—The branches of the vertebral and basilar arteries are the following :— The Lateral spinal branches (spinales laterales) enter the inter- vertebral foramina, and taking the course of the roots of the spinal nerves, are distributed to the spinal cord and vertebrae. Where the vertebral artery curves around the articular process of the atlas, it gives off several muscular branches (r. musculares). The Posterior meningeal (meningea posterior) are one or two small branches which enter the cranium through the foramen magnum, to be distributed to the dura mater of the cerebellar fossse, and to the falx cerebelli. One branch, described by Soemmering, passes into the cranium along the first cervical nerve. The Anterior spinal (spinalis anterior) is a small branch which unites with its fellow of the opposite side, on the front of the medulla oblongata. The artery formed by the union of these two vessels, descends along the anterior aspect of the spinal cord, to which it distributes branches. The Posterior spinal {spinalis posterior) winds around the medulla oblongata to the posterior aspect of the cord, and descends on either side to the cauda equina. It communicates very freely with the spinal branches of the intercostal and lumbar arteries, and near its origin sends a branch upwards to the fourth ventricle. The Inferior cerebellar arteries (cerebelli inferior posterior vel Vertebral. Basilar. Lateral spinal. Posterior meningeal, Anterior spinal. Posterior spinal, Inferior cerebellar.

Posterior cerebral. * Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, 1839.332 CIRCLE OP WILLIS. magna) wind around the upper part of the medulla oblongata to the under surface of the cerebellum, to which they are distributed. They pass between the filaments of origin of the hypoglossal nerve in their course, and anastomose with the superior cerebellar arteries. The Transverse branches of the basilar artery supply the pons Fig. 136.* * The circle of Willis. The arteries have references only on one side, on account of their symmetrical distribution. 1.

One of tliese branches, larger than the rest, passes along the crus cerebelli to be distributed to the anterior border of the cerebellum (a. cerebelli inferior, an- terior). This artery gives off a small branch, the auditiva interna, which accompanies the seventh pair of nerves into the meatus audi- torius internus; the auditory branch may be derived directly from the basilar. The Superior cerebellar arteries (cerebelli superior), two of the terminal branches of the basilar, wind around the crus cerebri on each side, lying in relation with the fourth nerve, and are distributed to the upper surface of the cerebellum inosculating with the inferior cerebellar. The Posterior cerebral arteries (cerebri posterior vel profunda) the other two terminal branches of the basilar, v/ind around the crus cerebri at each side, and are distributed to the posterior lobes of the cerebrum. They are separated from the superior cerebellar arteries near their origin, by the third pair of nerves, and are in close rela- tion with the fourth pair in their course around the crura cerebri. Anteriorly, near their origin, they give off a tuft of small vessels which enter the locus perforatus, and they receive the posterior com- municating arteries from the internal carotid. They also send a branch to the velum interpositum and plexus choroides {clioroidea posterior). The communications established between the anterior cerebral arterie^ in front, and the internal carotids and posterior cerebral arteries behind, by the communicating arteries, constitute the circle of Willis (circulus arteriosus Willisii). This remarkable vascular communication at the base of the brain is formed by the anterior communicating branch, anterior cerebrals, and internal carotid arteries in front, and by the posterior communicating, posterior cerebrals, and basilar artery behind. The Internal mammary artery (mammaria vel thoracica interna) arises from the under side of the subclavian, and passes down behind the subclavian vein to the cartilage of the first rib. It then descends by the side of the sternum, resting on the cartilages of the ribs, to the sheath of the rectus, where, under the name of superior epigastric, it terminates by inosculating with the epigastric branch of the external iliac. As the artery enters the chest it is crossed by the phrenic nerve; it then gets under cover of the pleura, and lower down lies between the triangularis sterni and the internal intercostal muscles; in the sheath of the rectus it sends branches to the walls of the abdomen. . The Branches of the internal mammary are,— Comes nervi phrenici, Anterior intercostal, Mediastinal, Perforating, Pericardiac, Musculo-phrenic. The Comes nervi phrenidi (phrenica superior), a long and slender334 INFERIOR THYROID ARTERY. branch given off by the artery as it enters the chest, descends with the phrenic nerve between the pleura and pericardium to the diaphragm, to which it is distributed, inosculating with the musculo- phrenic and abdominal phrenic arteries. The mediastinal and pericardiac branches are small vessels dis- tributed to the anterior mediastinum, pericardium, and thymus gland (thymicce). Some sternal branches are sent to supply the sternum and triangularis sterni muscle. The Anterior intercostals (intercostales anteriores) supply the in- tercostal muscles of the front of the chest, and inosculate with the aortic intercostals; to each space there are two arteries which run along the borders of the rib. Besides supplying the intercostal mus- cles, they send branches to the pectoral muscles and mammary gland. The Perforating arteries (mammary) pass forward to the front of the chest through the first six intercostal spaces; they then turn outwards, and after giving some branches to the front of the sternum, are distributed to the pectoral muscles and mammary gland. Those intended for the mammary gland are of larger size than the rest. The Musculo-phrenic artery, proceeding from the internal mam- mary at the interspace between the sixth and seventh ribs, passes downwards and outwards over the cartilages of the false ribs to the last intercostal space. It pierces the diaphragm at the attachment of that muscle to the eighth rib, and sends branches to the muscular structure, and others to the intercostal spaces of the false ribs. "The mammary arteries," says Dr. Harrison, " are remarkable for the number of their inosculations, and for the distant parts of the arterial system which they serve to connect. They anastomose with each other, and their inosculations, with the thoracic aorta, encircle the thorax. On the parietes of this cavity their branches connect the axillary and subclavian arteries; on the diaphragm they form a link in the chain of inosculations between the subclavian artery and abdominal aorta; and in the parietes of the abdomen they form an anastomosis most remarkable for the distance between those vessels which it serves to connect; namely, the arteries of the superior and inferior extremities." The Thyroid axis is a short trunk which arises from the front of the subclavian close to the inner border of the anterior scalenus, and divides almost immediately into three branches, inferior thyroid, suprascapular and transversa colli. The Inferior thyroid artery (thyroidea inferior) ascends ob- liquely in a serpentine course behind the sheath of the carotid vessels, and in front of the longus colli, to the inferior and posterior part of the thyroid gland, to which it is distributed. It is in rela- tion with the middle cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, which lies in front of it; and sends branches to the trachea, larynx, and oesophagus. Near its origin it gives off the following branch. The Cervicalis ascendens, a branch of the inferior thyroid, ascends upon the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes ofTRANSVERSA COLLI ARTERY. 335 the cervical vertebrae, lying in the groove between the scalenus anticus and rectus anticus major. It is distributed to the deep muscles and glands of the neck, and sends branches through the intervertebral foramina to supply the spinal cord and its membranes. The Supra-scapular artery (transversa scapulge; scapularis superior) passes obliquely outwards behind the clavicle, and over tlie ligament of the supra-scapular notch, to the supra-spinatus fossa. It crosses in its course the scalenus anticus muscle, phrenic nerve, and subclavian artery, is distributed to the muscles of the dorsum of the scapula, and inosculates with the posterior scapular, and beneath the acromion process with the dorsal branch of the subsca- pular artery. At the supra-scapular notch it sends a large branch outwards, which pierces the trapezius muscle, and becomes cutaneous at the tip of the shoulder (acromialis). The supra-scapular artery sometimes arises directly from the subclavian. Fig. 137.* The Transversa colli artery (scapularis posterior) passes transversely across the subclavian triangle at the root of the neck, to the anterior border of the levator anguK scapulae, where it divides into two terminal branches, the cervicalis superficialis and posterior scapular. In its course it lies above the supra-scapular artery, and crosses the scaleni muscles and brachial plexus of nerves, often * Branches of the right subclavian artery. 1. Arteria innominata. 2.

At its bifurcation it is covered in by the edge of the trapezius. The Cervicalis superficialis artery (cervicalis posterior) its as- cending branch, passes upwards under cover of the anterior border of the trapezius, and is distributed to the superficial muscles of the neck and deep cervical glands. The Posterior scapular artery (dorsalis scapulge, Tiedemann), th^ proper continuation of the transversa colli, passes backwards to the superior angle of the scapula, and then descends along the posterior border of that bone to its inferior angle, where it inosculates with the subscapular artery. In its course it lies under cover of the levator anguli scapulae and rhomboidei muscles, distributes branches to them and neighbouring muscles, and inosculates with the arteries of the scapula and branches of the intercostal arteries. The cervicalis superficialis and posterior scapular artery some- times arise separately, the former from the thyroid axis, the latter from the third portion of the subclavian. By means of its numerous inosculations the transversa colli artery maintains an important anastomotic communication between the branches of the external carotid, subclavian, and axillary arteries. The Superior intercostal artery (intercostalis suprema) arises from the upper and back part of the subclavian artery behind the scalenus anticus, and descending in front of the necks of the first two ribs, sends intercostal branches to the first two intercostal spaces, and dorsal branches to the muscles and integument of the back. The artery lies behind the pleura, and to the outer side of the sym- pathetic nerve, and in the second intercostal space inosculates with the first aortic intercostal. It gives off the cervicalis profunda. The Cervicalis profunda artery (profunda cervicis) arises by a common trunk with the preceding, or, more properly, is a branch of the superior intercostal, corresponding with the posterior branch of the other intercostal arteries. It passes backwards between the transverse processes of the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebra, and ascends the back part of the neck, between the complexus and semispinalis colli muscle. It inosculates with the princeps cervicis of the occipital artery, and with branches of the vertebral. Varieties of the subclavian arteries.-—Varieties in these arteries are rare; that which most frequently occurs is the origin of the right subclavian, from the left extremity of the arch of the aorta, below the left subclavian artery; The vessel, in this case, curves behind the oesophagus and right carotid artery, and sometimes between the oesophagus and trachea, to the upper border of the first rib on the right side of the chest, where it assumes its ordinary course. In of subclavian aneurism on the right side above the clavicle, which happened during the summer of 1839, Mr. Listen proceeded to perform the operation of tying the carotid and subclavian arteries at their point of division from the innominata. Upon reach- ing the spot where the bifurcation should have existed, he found that there was no subclavian artery. With the admirable self-possession337 AXILLAKY ARTERY= which distinguished that eminent surgeon in all cases of emergency, he continued his dissection more deeply, towards the vertebral column, and succeeded in securing the artery. It was ascertained after death, that the arteria innominata was extremely short, and that the sub- clavian was given off within the chest from the posterior aspect of its trunk, and pursued a deep course to the upper margin of the first rib. In a preparation which was shewn to me in Heidelberg, some years since, by Professor Tiedemann, the right subclavian artery arose from the thoracic aorta, as low down as the fourth dorsal vertebra, and ascended from that point to the border of the first rib. Yarieties in the branches of the subclavian are not unfrequent; the most interesting is the origin of the left vertebral from the arch of the aorta. AXILLARY ARTERY. The Axillary artery (axillaris) passes outwards and downwards with a gentle curve through the axillary space from the lower border of the first rib to the lower border of the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major, where it becomes the brachial. Relations.—After emerging from beneath the margin of the costo- coracoid membrane, it is in relation with the axillary vein, which lies at first to the inner side, and then in front of the artery. Near the middle of the axilla it is embraced by the two heads of the median nerve, and covered in by the pectoral muscles. On the imier or thoracic side it is in relation, first, with the first intercostal muscle; it next rests upon the first serration of the serratus magnus; and is then separated from the chest by the brachial plexus of nerves. By its outer or hurifieral side it is at first separated from the brachial plexus by a triangular interval of cellular tissue; it next rests against the tendon of the subscapularis muscle; and thirdly, upon the coraco- brachialis muscle. The relations of the axillary artery may be thus arranged:— In Front. • Inner or Thoracic Side. Outer or Ilumeral Side. Pectoralis major. First intercostal muscle.

The Superior thoracic (suprema; short thoracic), the highest of the branches of the axillary, and sometimes derived from the next, passes inwards to the chest in front of the pectoralis minor muscle, and is distributed to the pectoral muscles and walls of the chest. It anastomoses with the intercostal and mammary arteries. The Thoracica acromialis (thoracica humeraria) is a short trunk which proceeds from the axillary in the space above the pec- toralis minor muscle, and divides into three sets of branches, pectoral, which are distributed to the pectoral muscles, serratus magnus, and mammary gland; acromial (r. transversus), which pass outwards to the acromion, and inosculate with branches of the suprascapular artery; and descending (r. deltoideus), a single branch, which follows the interspace between the deltoid and pec- toralis major muscle, and is in relation with the cephalic vein. The Long thoracic (thoracica inferior; mammaria externa) de- scends along the lower border of the pectoralis minor to the side of the chest. It is distributed to the pectoralis major and minor, serratus magnus, and mammary gland; inosculating with the superior thoracic. Intercostal, and mammary arteries. • The Thoracica alaris is a small branch distributed to the plexus of nerves and glands in the axilla. It is frequently wanting; its place being supplied by a branch derived from one of the other thoracic branches. The Subscapular artery (scapularis inferior), the largest of the branches of the axillary, runs along the lower border of the sub- scapularis muscle, to the inferior angle of the scapula, where it inosculates with the posterior scapular, a branch of the subclavian. It supplies the muscles of the under surface and inferior border of the scapula, and the side of the chest. At about an inch and a half from the axillary, it gives off a large branch, the dorsalis scapulce (circumflexa scapulse), which passes backwards through the triangular space bounded by the teres minor, teres major, and scapular head of the triceps, and beneath the infra-spinatus muscle to the dorsum of the scapula, where it is distributed, inosculating with the suprascapular and posterior scapular arteries. The Circumflex arteries {circumflexse humeri) wind around the neck of the humerus. The anterior, very small, passes beneath the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps, and sends a branch upwards along the bicipital groove to supply the shoulder-joint. The Posterior circumflex, of larger size, passes backwards through the quadrangular space bounded by the teres minor and major, the scapular head of the triceps and the humerus, and is distributed to the deltoid muscle and shoulder-joint. Sometimes this artery is a branch of the superior profunda of the brachial. It then ascends behind the tendon of the teres major, and is distributed to the deltoid without passing through the quadrangular space. Varieties of the Axillary artery.—The most frequent peculiarity of this kind is the division of the vessel into two trunks of equal z 2^40 BRACHIAL ARTERY. size : a musctilar trtmk, which gives off some of the ordinary axil- lary branches and supplies the upper arm, and a continued trunk, which represents the brachial artery. The next most frequent variety is the high division of the ulnar which passes down the arm by the side of the brachial artery, and superficially to the muscles proceeding from the inner condyle, to its ordinary distribution in the hand. In this course it lies immediately beneath the deep fascia of the forearm, and may be seen and felt pulsating beneath the integTiment. The high division of the radial from the axillary is rare. In one instance, I saw the axillary artery divide into three branches of nearly equal size, which passed together down the arm, and at the bend of the elbow resolved themselves into radial, ulnar, and interosseous. But the most interesting variety, both in a phy- siological and surgical sense, is that described by Dr. Jones Quain, in his " Elements of Anatomy." " I found in the dissecting-room, a few years ago, a variety not hitherto noticed; it was at first taken for the ordinary high division of the ulnar artery. The two vessels descended from the point of division at the border of the axilla, and lay parallel with one another in their course through the arm; but instead of diverging, as is usual, at the bend of the elbow, they converged, and united so as to form a short trunk, which soon divided again into the radial and ulnar arteries in the regular way." In a subject, dissected by myself, this variety existed in both arms; and I have seen several instances of a similar kind. The Brachial a/rtery (brachialis; humeraria) passes down the inner side of the arm, from the lower border of the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major, to a little below the bend of the elbow, where it divides into the radial and ulnar artery. Relations.—In its course downwards, it rests upon the triceps, coraco-brachialis, brachialis anticus, and the tendon of the biceps. To its inner side is the internal cutaneous and ulnar nerve; to the outer side, the coraco-brachialis and biceps; in front it has the basilic vein, and is crossed by the median nerve. Its relations, within its sheath, are the vense comites. BRACHIAL ARTERY. Plan of the Relations of the Brachial Artery. In Front. Basilic vein. Deep fascia, Median nerve, Inner Side.

Inferior profunda, Muscular and Nutrient. The Superior profunda (brachialis profunda; profunda humeri) arises opposite the lower border of the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, and winds around the humerus, between the triceps and the bone, to the space between the brachialis anticus and supinator longus, where it inosculates with the radial recurrent artery. It accom- panies the musculo-spiral nerve. In its course it gives off the posterior articular artery, which descends to the elbow-joint, and a more superficial branch, which descends by the side of the external intermuscular septum and inosculates with the interosseous articular artery. The inferior muscular branches of the superior profunda inosculate with the inferior profunda, anastomotica magna and ulnar recurrent. The Inferior profunda (coUateralis ulnaris superior) arises from about the middle of the brachial artery, and descends to the space between the inner condyle and olecranon in company with the ulnar nerve, where it inosculates with the posterior ulnar recurrent. In its course it pierces the intermuscular septum. The Anastomotica magna (coUateralis ulnaris inferior) is given off nearly at right angles from the brachial, at about two inches above the joint. It'passes directly inwards upon the brachialis anticus muscle, pierces the intermuscular septum, and winds around the humerus to inosculate with the superior profunda. On the brachialis anticus it divides into two branches, which inosculate with the anterior and posterior ulnar recurrent arteries and with the inferior profunda. The Muscular branches are distributed to the muscles in the course of the artery, namely, to the coraco-brachialis, biceps, del- toideus, brachialis anticus and triceps. The Nutrient branch (nu- tritia humeri) is given off at about the middle of the arm, and passes into the medullary foramen situated near the insertion of the coraco-brachialis muscle. Varieties of the Brachial artery.—The most frequent peculiarity in the distribution of branches from this artery is the high division of the radial, which arises generally from about the upper third of the brachial artery, and descends to its normal position at the bend of the elbow. The ulnar artery sometimes arises from the brachial at about two inches above the elbow, and pursues either a super- ficial or deep course to the wrist; and, in more than one instance, I have seen the interosseous artery arise from the brachial a little above the bend of the elbow. The two profunda arteries occasionally arise by a common trunk, or there may be two superior profundse.342 EADIAL ARTERY. The Radial artery (radialis), one of the divisions of the brachial, appears, from its direction, to be the continuation of that trunk. It runs along the radial side of the forearm, from the bend of the elbow to the wrist; it then turns backwards around the base of the thumb, beneath its extensor tendons, and passes between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, into the palm of the hand. It next crosses the metacarpal bones to the ulnar side of the hand, forming the deep palmar arch, and terminates by inos- culating with the superficial palmar arch. In the upper half of its course, the radial artery is situated between the supinator longus muscle, by which it is slightly overlapped, and the pronator radii teres; in the lower half, between the tendons of the supinator longus and flexor carpi radialis. It rests in succes- sion on the supinator brevis, pronator radii teres, radial origin of the flexor sublimis, flexor longus pollicis, and pronator quadratus; and is covered in by the integument and fasciae. At the wrist it is situated in contact with the external lateral ligament and beneath the extensor tendons of the thumb; and, in the palm of the hand, beneath the flexor tendons. It is accompanied by vense comites; and by its middle third is in relation with the radial nerve which lies to its outer side. Plan of the Relations of the Eadial Artery in the Forearm. In Front.

The Radial recurrent branch (radialis recurrens) is given off im- mediately below the elbow; it ascends in the space between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus, sends branches to the muscles arising from the external condyle, and inosculates with the terminal branches of the superior profunda. The Muscular branches are distributed to the muscles of the radial border of the forearm. The Superficialis voice (radio-palmaris) is given off from the radial artery while at the wrist. It passes between the fibres of the ab- ducitor pollicis muscle, and inosculates with the termination of the ulnar artery, completing the superficial palmar arch. This artery is variable in size, being sometimes as large as the continuation of the radial, and at other times a mere muscular twig, or entirely wanting; when of large size it supplies the palmar side of the thumb and the radial side of the index finger. The Carpea anterior passes inwards along the lower border of the pronator quadratus, and forms an arch by inosculating with the anterior carpal branch of the ulnar artery. From this arch-twigs are given off to supply the wrist-joint. The Carpea posterior crosses the carpus transversely, and inos- culates with the posterior carpal branch of the ulnar artery. Supe- riorly it inosculates with the termination of the anterior interos- seous artery; inferiorly it gives off dorsal interosseous branches, which anastomose with the perforating branches of the deep palmar arch, and run forward upon the dorsal interossei muscles of the third and fourth metacarpal spaces. The Metacarpea or first dorsal interosseous branch runs forward to the metacarpal space between the index and middle finger. At the cleft of the fingers it inosculates with the palmar digital artery, and gives off dorsal collateral branches. It is joined opposite the heads of the interosseous muscle by the perforating branch from the deep palmar arch. The Dorsales pollicis are two small branches which run along the sides of the dorsal aspect of the thumb.344 RADIAL ARTERY. Mg. 139.* The Dorsalis indicis is a very small brancli which runs along the radial bor- der of the metacarpal bone and phalanges of the index finger. The Princeps pollicis, the great artery of the thumb, passes along the metacarpal bone of the thumb, between the first dorsal interosseous (abductor indicis) and flexor brevis pollicis to the base of the first phalanx; and, be- tween the two heads of the latter muscle, in the gToove of the tendon of the flexor longus, it divi.des into two collateral branches for the palmar borders of the thumb. The Radialis indicis, the digital branch of the radial side of the index finger, is directed inwards between the abductor indicis and the flexor brevis and adductor pollicis . to the side of .the finger, along which it is dis- tributed, forming its radial * Arteries of the forearm. 1.

Near its origin it gives ofif a small branch (more frequently a direct branch of the radial), which inosculates with the superficial palmar arch. The Interossece palmares, three or four in number, are branches of the deep palmar arch; they pass forward upon the interossei muscles, and inosculate with the digital branches of the superficial arch, opposite the heads of the metacarpal bones. The Perforantes, three in number, pass directly backwards between the heads of the dorsal interossei muscles, and inosculate with the dorsal interosseous arteries. The Recurrent branches of the deep palmar arch pass upwards in front of the wrist-joint, and inosculate with the arterial arch formed by the anterior carpal arteries. ULNAR ARTERY. The Ulnar artery (ulnaris; cubitalis), the other and larger division of the brachial, crosses the forearm obliquely to the com- mencement of its middle third; it then runs down the ulnar side of the forearm to the wrist, crosses the annular ligament, and forms the superficial palmar arch (arcus volaris superficialis), which termi- nates by inosculating with the superficialis volse.

In the second part of its course, it is placed upon the flexor profundus and pronator quadratus, lying between the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor sublimis digitorum. While crossing the annular ligament it is protected from injury by a strong tendi- nous arch, thrown over it from the pisiform bone; and in the palm it rests upon the tendons of the flexor sublimis, being covered in by the palmaris brevis muscle and palmar fascia. It is accompanied in its course by the vense comites, and is in relation with the ulnar nerve for the lower two-thirds of its extent; the nerve lying to its ulnar side. The Branches of the ulnar artery may be arranged, like those of the radial, into three groups : Forearm, ' Anterior ulnar recurrent. Posterior ulnar recurrent, T . ( Anterior interosseous, interosseous, i -n . • • . ' ^ rostenor interosseous. Muscular. ( Carpea anterior. Wrist, \ Carpea posterior, Hand \ ^*^^^^^i^^*i^§> ( Metacarpea. \ Digitales. The Anterior ulnar recurrent arises immediately below the elbow, and ascends in front of the joint between the pronator radii teres and brachialis anticus, where it distributes branches to the muscles, and inosculates with the anastomotica magna and inferior profunda. The two recurrent arteries frequently arise by a common trunk. The Posterior ulnar recurrent, larger than the preceding, arises immediately below the elbow-joint, and passes backwards beneath the origins of the superficial layer of muscles; it then ascends be- tween the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, lying beneath the ulnar nerve, and inosculates with the inferior profunda, anastomotica magna, and interosseous recurrent. The Interosseous artery is a short trunk which arises from the ulnar, opposite the bicipital tuberosity of the radius, and passes backwards to the interosseous membrane, where it divides into the anterior and posterior interosseous artery. The Anterior interosseous (interossea interna) passes down the forearm upon the interosseous membrane, between the flexor pro- fundus digitorum and flexor longus pollicis, and behind the pronator quadratus; it then passes through an opening in the interosseous membrane to the back of the wrist, where it inosculates with the posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar. The anterior interosseous artery gives off several muscular branches; nutrient branches to the radius and ulna; a companion branch to the347 INTEROSSEOUS ARTERY. median nerve; and at tlie tipper border of the pronator quadratus, a small branch, which descends behind that muscle to mosculate with the anterior carpal arteries. The median artery is sometimes of large size, and occasionally takes the place of the superficial palmar arch. The Posterior interosseous artery (interossea externa; perforans snprema) passes backwards through an opening between the upper part of the interosseous membrane and the oblique ligament, and descends between the superficial and deep layer of muscles of the forearm to the back of the wrist, where it inosculates with the an- terior interosseous and posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar. At its upper part it gives ofi" a recurrent branch, ^posterior interosseous recurrent, which returns upon the elbow between the anconeus, extensor carpi ulnaris and supinator brevis muscles, and anastomoses with the posterior terminal branches of the superior profunda. The Muscular branches of the ulnar artery are distributed to the muscles of the ulnar border of the forearm. The Carpea anterior, a branch of small size, passes outwards upon the front of the wrist-joint, and contributes to form the anterior carpal arch by inosculating with the anterior carpal branch of the radial artery. The Carpea posterior, larger than the preceding, passes beneath the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle to the back of the wrist- joint, where it inosculates with the posterior carpal branch of the radial artery, and forms a posterior carpal arch. The Metacarpea, often a branch of the preceding, passes along the inner border of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, and forms the dorsal collateral branch of that finger. The Communicating or deep branch arises close to the annular ligament, and dips between the abductor minimi digiti and flexor brevis to inosculate with the termination of the deep palmar arch. It is accompanied by the deep palmar branch of the ulnar nerve. The Digital branches, four in number, are given off from the con- vexity of the superficial palmar arch. The first and smallest is distributed to the ulnar side of the little finger. The other three are short trunks, which divide between the heads of the metacarpal bones, and form the collateral branch of the radial side of the little finger, the collateral branches of the ring and middle fingers, and the collateral branch of the ulnar side of the index finger. On the last phalanx, the collateral arteries communicate and form an arch, from which numerous branches are given off to the tip of the finger. The arteries of the hand are subject to frequent variety of distri- bution.348 BRANCHES OP THE THORACIC AORTA. Pericardiac, Bronchial, CEsophageal, Posterior mediastinal. Intercostal. The Pericardiac arteries are a few small and irregular branches distributed to the pericardium. The Bronchial arteries, generally three in number, one for the right lung and two for the left, vary both in size and origin; the right often proceeding from a short trunk common to it and one of the left bronchial branches, or from the first aortic intercostal. They take their course to the back of the root of the lung, and ac- company the ramifications of the bronchial tubes through its sub- stance. They give twigs also to the bronchial glands, oesophagus, and pericardium. The Oesophageal arteries (oesophageas), five or six in number, arise from the anterior part of the aorta, and are distributed to the oesophagus, establishing a chain of anastomoses along that tube: the superior inosculate with the bronchial arteries, and with oesophageal branches of the inferior thyroid arteries; and the inferior with similar branches of the phrenic and gastric arteries. The Posterior mediastinal arteries are small twigs distributed to the lymphatic glands and cellular tissue of the posterior medias- tinum. The Intercostal, or posterior intercostal arteries (intercostales inferiores), arise from the posterior part of the aorta; they are ten in number on each side, the first intercostal space being supplied by the superior intercostal artery, a branch of the subclavian. The right intercostals are longer than the left, on account of the position of the aorta. They ascend somewhat obliquely from their origin, ajid cross the vertebral column behind the thoracic duct, vena azygos major, and sympathetic nerve, to the intercostal spaces; the left passing beneath the superior intercostal vein, the vena azygos minor and sympathetic. In the intercostal space, or rather upon the external intercostal muscle, each artery gives off a dorsal branch, which passes back between the transverse processes of the vertebrae, lying internally to the middle costo-transverse ligament, and divides into a spinal branch, which supplies the spinal cord and vertebrae, and a muscidar branch which is distributed to the muscles and in- tegument of the back. The intercostal artery then comes into relation with its vein and nerve, the former being above, the latter349 BRANCHES OP THE ABDOMINAL AOETA. below, and ascends obliquely to the lower border of the rib, with which it conies into relation near the angle of the bone. It then runs along the lower border of the rib, lying between the two planes of intercostal muscles to the front of the chest, where it inosculates with the corresponding anterior intercostal branch of the internal mammary. Besides the dorsal branch arid several small muscular branches, the intercostal artery, at about the middle of its course, gives off a large inferior branch, which runs along the upper border of the rib below to -the fore part of the chest, and inosculates with the inferior anterior intercostal branch of the internal mammary. "While between the two planes of intercostal muscles, the inter- costal artery is protected from pressure by little tendinous arches thrown across it and attached by each extremity to the bone. The upper pair of intercostal arteries inosculate with the superior inter- costals of the subclavians; the lower intercostals anastomose with the lumbar and epigastric arteries in the parietes of the abdomen. Spermatic, The Phrenic arteries (phrenicse; diaphragmaticae) are given off (frequently by a common trunk) from the anterior part of the aorta as soon as that vessel has emerged through the aortic opening. Pass- ing obliquely outwards upon the under surface of the diaphragm, each artery divides into two branches, an internal branch, which runs forward and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side in front of the oesophageal opening; and an external branch, which proceeds outwards towards the great circumference of the muscle, and sends branches to the supra-renal capsules. The phrenic arteries inosculate with branches of the internal mammary, intercostal, epi- gastric, oesophageal, gastric, hepatic, and supra-renal arteries. They are not unfrequently derived from the coeliac axis, or from one of its divisions, and sometimes they give origin to the supra-renal arteries. The C(ELiAC AXIS (coeliaca; KoiXia, ventriculus) is the first single trunk given off from the abdominal aorta. It arises opposite the upper border of the first lumbar vertebra, is about half-an-inch in length, and divides into three large branches, gastric, hepatic, and splenic. branches of the abdominal aorta.

Relations.—The trunk of the coeliac axis has in relation with it, in front the lesser omentum; on the right side the right semilunar ganglion and lobus Spigelii of the liver; on the left side, the left semilunar ganglion and cardiac portion of the stomach; and helow, the upper border of the pancreas and lesser curve of the stomach. Iti s completely surrounded by the solar plexus. The Gastric artery (coronaria ventriculi), the smallest of the three branches of the coeliac axis, ascends between the two layers of the lesser omentum to the cardiac orifice of the stomach, then runs along the lesser cTirvature to the pylorus, and inosculates with the pyloric branch of the hepatic. It is distributed to the lower ex- tremity of the oesophagus and lesser curve of the stomach; and anastomoses with the oesophageal arteries, vasa brevia of the splenic artery, and pyloric branch of the hepatic artery. The Hepatic artery (hepatica) curves forward, and ascends along the right border of the lesser omentum to the Hver, where it divides into two branches (right and left), which enter the trans- verse fissure, and are distributed along the portal canals to the right and left lobes.* It is in relation, in the right border of the lesser omentum, with the ductus communis choledochus and portal vein, and is surrounded by the hepatic plexus of nerves, and numerous lymphatics. There are sometimes two hepatic arteries, in which case one is derived from the superior mesenteric artery. The Branches of the hepatic artery are, the The Pyloric branch, given off from the hepatic near the pylorus, is distributed to the commencement of the duodenum and to the lesser curve of the stomach, where it inosculates with the gastric artery. The Gastro-duodenalis artery is a short but large trunk, which descends behind the pylorus, and divides into two branches, the gastro-epiploica dextra, and pancreatico-duodenahs. Previously to its division it gives off some inferior pyloric branches to the small end of the stomach. The Gastro-epiploica dextra runs along the great curve of the stomach lying between the two layers of the great omentum, and inosculates at about its middle with the gastro-epiploica sinistra, a branch of the splenic artery. It supplies the great curve of the stomach and great omentum; hence its name. * For tlie mode of distribution of the hepatic artery within the liver, see the " Structural Anatomy" of that organ in the Chapter on the Viscera.

It inosculates infe- riorly with the inferior pancreatico-duodenalis and pancreatic branches of the superior mesenteric artery. The Cystic artery, generally a branch of the right hepatic, is of small size, and ramifies between the coats of the gall-bladder, pre- viously to its distribution to the mucous membrane.

In its course the vessel is tortuous and serpentine, and frequently makes a complete turn upon itself. It lies in a narrow groove in the upper border of the pancreas, and is accompanied by the splenic vein which lies beneath it, and by the splenic plexus of nerves. The Branches of the splenic artery are the— Pancreatic8B parvse, Vasa brevia, Pancreatica magna, Grastro-epiploica sinistra. The Pancreatiom parvcB are numerous small branches distributed to the pancreas, as the splenic artery runs along its upper border. One of these, larger than the rest, follows the course of the pancreatic duct, and is called, pancreatica magna. The Vasa brevia (gastricse breves) are five or six branches of small size which pass from the extremity of the splenic artery and its terminal branches, between the layers of the gastro-splenic omentum, to the great end of the stomach, to which they are distributed, in- osculating with branches of the gastric artery and gastro-epiploica sinistra.. The Grastro-epiploica sinistra appears to be the continuation of the splenic artery; it passes forwards from left to right, along the great ciirve of the stomach, lying between the layers of the great omentum, and inosculates with the gastro-epiploica dextra. It is distributed to the greater curve of the stomach and great omentum. The Superior mesenteric artery (mesenterica vel mesaraica superior), the second of the single trunks, and next in size to the coeliac axis, arises from the aorta immediately below that vessel, and behind the pancreas. It passes forwards between the pancreas and transverse duodenum, and descends within the layers of the mesen- tery, to the right iliac fossa, where it terminates very much dimi- nished in size. It forms a curve in its course, the convexity being directed towards the left, the concavity to the right. It is in rela- tion near its commencement with the portal vein : and is accompa- nied by two veins, and the superior mesenteric plexus of nerves. The branches of the superior mesenteric artery are— Pancreatico -duodenalis Ileo -colica, inferior, Colica dextra, Vasa intestini tenuis, Colica media. The Pancreatico-cluodenalis inferior is a small branch which arises from the superior mesenteric while behind the pancreas, and curves upwards along the line of junction of the pancreas and duo- denum. It supplies both those organs, and inosculates with the pancreatico-duodenalis branch of the hepatic. The Vasa intestini tenuis arise from the convexity of the superior A ASUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY. 354 mesenteric artery. They vary from fifteen to twenty in number, and are distributed to the small intestine from the duodenum to the termination of the ileum. In their course between the layers of the mesentery, they form a series of arches by the inosculation of their larger branches; from these are developed secondary arches, and from the latter a third series of arches, from which the branches arise which are distributed to the coats of the intestine. From the middle branches a fourth and sometimes even a fifth series of arches is pro- Fig. 142.* Course and distribution of the superior mesenteric artery. 1. Descend- ing portion of the duodenum. 2.

By means of these arches a direct communication is esta- blished between all the branches given off from the convexity of the superior mesenteric artery; the upper branch inosculates with the inferior pancreatico-duodenalis; the lower with the ileo-colica. The Ileo-colic artery is the last branch given off from the con- cavity of the superior mesenteric. It descends to the right iliac fossa, and divides into branches which communicate and form arches, from which branches are distributed to the termination of the ileum, the caecum, and the commencement of the colon. This artery in- osculates on the one hand with the termination of the mesenteric trunk, and on the other with the colica dextra. The Colica dextra arises from about the middle of the concavity of the superior mesenteric, and passing outwards behind the peri- toneum, divides into branches which form arches, and are distri- buted to the ascending colon. Its descending branches inosculate with the ileo-colica, the ascending with the colica media. The Colica media arises from the upper part of the concavity of the superior mesenteric, and passes forward between the layers of the transverse mesocolon, where it forms arches, and is distri- buted to the transverse colon. It inosculates on the right with the colica dextra ; and on the left with the colica sinistra, a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery. Thfe Spermatic arteries (spermaticas intemae) are two small vessels which arise from the front of the aorta below the superior mesenteric ; from this origin each artery passes obliquely out- wards, and accompanies the corresponding ureter along the front of the psoas muscle to the border of the pelvis, where it is in re- lation with the external iliac artery. It is then directed outwards to the internal abdominal ring, and follows the course of the sper- matic cord along the spermatic canal and through the scrotum to the testicle, to which it is distributed. The right spermatic artery lies in front of the vena cava, and both vessels are accompanied by their corresponding veins and by the spermatic plexuses of nerves. The spermatic arteries in the female (ovarian) descend into the pelvis and pass between the two layers of the broad ligaments of the uterus, to be distributed to the broad ligaments, ovaries. Fallopian tubes, and round ligaments ; along the latter they are continued to the inguinal canal and labium on each side. They inosculate with the uterine arteries. The Inferior mesenteric artery (mesenterica inferior), smaller than the superior, arises from the abdominal aorta, about two inches below the origin of that vessel, and descends between the layers of the left mesocolon, to the left iliac fossa, where it divides into three branches: Colica sinistra, Sigmoidea, Hfemorrhoidalis superior. A A 2INFERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY. 356 The Colica sinistra (superior) is distributed to the descending colon ; it passes upwards and outwards behind the peritoneum, and divides into two branches, one of which (ramus anastomoticus) Fig. 143.* * Branches of the inferior mesenteric artery. 1,1.

The inosculation of the colica sinistra with the colica media is the largest arterial anastomosis in the body. The Sigmoid artery (colica sinistra inferior) passes obliquely outwards behind the peritoneum and divides into branches which form arches, and are distributed to the sigmoid flexure of the colon. The superior branch inosculates with the colica sinistra, the inferior with the superior hsemorrhoidal artery. The Superior hcemorrhoidal artery is the continuation of the inferior mesenteric. It crosses the ureter and common iliac artery of the left side, and descends between the two layers of the meso- rectum as far as the middle of the rectum, to which it is distributed, anastomosing with the middle and inferior hsemorrhoidal arteries. The Supra-renal (suprarenales; capsulares) are two small vessels which arise from the aorta immediately above the renal arteries, and are distributed to the supra-renal capsules. They are sometimes branches of the phrenic or of the renal arteries. The Renal arteries (renales ; emulgentes) are two large trunks given off from the sides of the aorta immediately below the supe- rior mesenteric artery ; the right is longer than the left on account of the position of the aorta, and passes behind the vena cava to the kidney of that side. The left is somewhat higher than the right. They divide into several large branches previously to entering the kidney, and ramify very minutely in its vascular portion. The renal arteries supply several small branches to the supra-renal capsules, and one to the ureter. The Lumbar arteries (lumbales) correspond with the intercostals in the chest; they are four or five in number on each side, curve around the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae beneath the psoas muscles, and divide into two branches ; one of which passes backwards between the transverse processes, and is distributed to the vertebrae and spinal cord and muscles of the back, whilst the a^er, taking its course behind the quadratus lumborum, supplies tngk abdominal muscles, and inosculates with branches of the internal mammary and epigastric artery. The first lumbar artery runs along the lower border of the last rib, and the last along the crest of the ilium. In passing between the psoas muscle and the vertebrae, they are protected by a series of tendinous arches, which defend them and the communicating branches of the sympathetic nerve from pressure during the action of the muscle. The Sacra media arises from the posterior part of the aorta at its bifurcation, and descends along the middle of the anterior sur- face of the sacrum to the first piece of the coccyx, where it termi-358 COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES. nates by inosculating with the lateral sacral arteries. It distributes branches to the rectum and anterior sacral nerves,, and inosculates on either side with the lateral sacral arteries. Varieties in the Branches of the Abdominal Aorta.—The phrenic arteries are very rarely both derived from the aorta. One or both may be branches of the coeliac axis ; one may proceed from the gastric artery, from the renal, or from the upper lumbar. There are occasionally three or more phrenic arteries. The coeliac axis is variable in length, and gives off its branches irregularly. There are sometimes two or even three hepatic arteries, one of which may be derived from the gastric or even from the superior mesenteric. The colica media is sometimes derived from the hepatic artery. The spermatic arteries are variable both in origin and number. The right spermatic may be a branch of the renal, and the left of the inferior mesenteric. The supra-renal arteries may be derived from the phrenic or renal arteries. The renal arteries present several varieties in number ; there may be three or even four on one side, and one only on the other. When there are several renal arteries on one side, one may arise from the common iliac artery, from the front of the aorta near its lower part, or from the internal iliac. COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES. The abdominal aorta divides opposite the fourth lumbar ver- tebra into the two common iliac arteries. Sometimes the bifur- cation takes place as high as the third, and occasionally as low as the fifth. The common iliac arteries (iliacce communes vel primitivw) are about two inches in length ; they diverge from the termination of the aorta, and pass downwards and outwards on each side to the margin of the pelvis, opposite the sacro-iliac symphysis, where they divide into the internal and external iliac. In old persons the com- mon iliac arteries are more or less dilated and curved in their course. The Right artery is somewhat longer than the left, and forms a more obtuse angle with the termination of the aorta ; the angle of bifurcation is greater in the female than in the male. Relations.—The relations of the two arteries are different on the two sides of the body. The right common iliac is in relation in front with the peritoneum, and is crossed at its bifurcation by the ureter. It is in relation behind with the two common iliac veins, and externally with the psoas magnus. The left is in relation in front with the peritoneum, and is crossed by the rectum and superior hsemorrhoidal artery, and, at its bifurcation, by the ureter. It is in relation behind with the left common iliac vein, and externally with the psoas magnus.359 •"■INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. The Internal Iliac Artery {iliaca interna; hypogastrica), is a short trunk, varying in length from an inch to two inches. It de- scends obliquely forwards to a point opposite the upper margin of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, where it divides into an anterior and a posterior trunk. In the foetus, the internal iliac artery under the name of hypogastric is continued onwards by the side of the fundus of the bladder to near its apex, whence it ascends by the side of the linea alba and urachus to the umbilicus, where it becomes the umbilical artery. After birth, this artery ceases to be pervious beyond the side of the bladder, and the obliterated portion is con- verted into a fibrous cord. The projection of these two cords on the inner wall of the abdomen causes the depression on each side, which goes by the name of the peritoneal fossa. Relations.—This artery rests externally on the sacral plexus and Mg. 144.* * Iliac arteries. 1. Aorta. 2. Left common iliac artery. 3. External iliac. 4. Epigastric artery. 5. Circumflexa ilu. 6.

Branches.—The branches of the anterior trunk are the— The Superior vesical arteries are three or four small branches, which proceed from the pervious portion of the hypogastric cord. They are distributed to the upper and middle part of the bladder. From one of these there passes off a small artery, the deferential, which accompanies the vas deferens along the spermatic cord. The Inferior vesical, somewhat larger than the preceding, passes down upon the side of the bladder to its base, and is distributed to that region, the yesiculse seminales, and prostate gland. The Middle ha^morrJioidal artery, frequently a branch of the pre- ceding, passes downwards to the rectum, to which it is distributed, inosculating with the superior and inferior hsemorrhoidal arteries. In the female it distributes branches to the vagina. The Uterine artery passes downwards between the layers of the broad ligament to the neck of the uterus, and then ascends in a tortuous course along its lateral border. It gives off branches to the vagina, the lower part of the bladder, the Fallopian tube (tubaria), ovary (ovaria), and round ligament, and inosculates with the sper- matic or ovarian artery. According to Weber the ovarian branch of the uterine is the special artery of the ovary. The Vaginal artery corresponds in position with the inferior vesical, and is distiibuted to the vagina and neighbouring parts of the bladder and rectum. The Obturator artery (obturatoria; arising frequently from the posterior trunk of the internal iliac) passes forwards from the an- terior trunk, a little below the brim of the pelvis, to the upper border of the obturator foramen. Escaping from the pelvis through a tendinous arch formed by the obturator membrane, it divides into two branches, internal and external. Its branches within the pelvis are: an iliac branch, which sup- plies the bone of the iliac fossa, and inosculates with the ilio-lumbar artery ; and & pubic branch which is given off close to the obturator foramen, and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side, behind the pubes, and with the pubic branch of the epigastric artery.

Gluteal.361 INTEKNAL PUDIC ARTERY. The internal branch curves inwards around the bony margin of the obturator foramen, and distributes branches to the obturator and adductor muscles, inosculating with the internal circumflex artery of the femoral. The external branch winds around the outer margin of the obturator foramen to the space between the gemellus inferior and quadratus femoris, where it inosculates with the ischiatic artery. In ' its course it inosculates also with the internal circumflex, and sends a small branch through the notch in the acetabulum (r. acetabuli) to supply the ligamentum teres. The Ischiatic artery (ischiadica; glutsea inferior) is the larger of the two terminal branches of the anterior division of the internal iliac. It passes downwards in front of the pyriformis and sacral plexus of nerves, and internally to the pudic artery, to the lower part of the great ischiatic foramen, where it escapes from the pelvis between the inferior border of the pyriformis and the coccygeus. It then descends in the space between the trochanter major and tube- rosity of the ischium in company with the ischiatic nerves, and divides into several branches, the principal of which are, the coccy- geal, comes nervi ischiatici and muscular. The Coccygeal branch pierces the great sacro-ischiatic ligament, and is distributed to the coccygeus and levator ani, and to the inte- gument around the anus and coccyx. , The Comes nervi ischiatici is a slender branch, which accom- panies the great ischiatic nerve extending as far as the lower part of the thigh. The Muscular branches supply the muscles of the posterior part of the hip and thigh, and inosculate with the internal and external circumflex arteries, obturator, and superior perforating; some branches are also sent to the hip-joint. The Internal pudic artery (pudenda interna) the other termi- nal branch of the anterior trunk of the internal iliac, descends ex- ternally to the ischiatic artery to the lower part of the great ischiatic foramen. It emerges from the pelvis through the great s'acro- ischiatic foramen between the lower border of the pyriformis and the coccygeus, crosses the spine of the ischium, and re-enters the pelvis through the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen; in the next place it passes forward on the internal obturator muscle to the ramus of the ischium, being situated at about an inch from the margin of the tuberosity, and bound down by the obturator fascia; it then ascends by the side of the ramus of the ischium and pubes, and near the symphysis pierces the triangular ligament of the perineum and divides into two terminal branches, arteria corporis cavernosi, and arteria dorsalis penis. Branches.—The branches of the internal pudic artery within theINTERNAL PUDIC ARTEBY. 362 pelvis are several small ramuscules to the levator ani and sacral nerves; and occasionally a branch which takes the place of the inferior vesical or middle haemorrhoidal artery.

The Inferior hcemorrhoidal arteries (extemse) are three or four small branches, given off by the internal pudic while behind the tuberosity of the ischium. They cross the ischio-rectal fossa, and Fig. 145.* * Arteries of the perineum; on the right side the superficial arteries are seen, on the left the deep. 1.

The Superficial perineal artery (perinsea) is given off near the attachment of the crus penis; it pierces the connecting layer of the perineal fascia and triangular ligament, and runs forward across the transversus perinei muscle, and along the groove between the accelerator urinse and erector penis to the septum scroti, upon which it ramifies under the name of arteria septi. It distributes branches to the scrotum (scrotales posteriores) and perineum. One of the latter, larger than the rest, crosses the perineum, resting on the transversus perinei muscle, and is named the transversa perinei. There are often two superficial perineal arteries. The Artery of the bulb (bulbo-urethralis) is given off from the pudic nearly opposite the opening for the transmission of the urethra; it passes almost transversely inwards behind the triangular ligament, and pierces that ligament to enter the corpus spongiosum at its bulbous extremity. It is distributed to the corpus spongiosum. The Artery of the-corpus cavernosum (profunda penis) pierces the crus penis, and runs forward in the interior of the corpus cavernosum, by the side of the septum pectiniforme. It ramifies in the parenchyma of the venous structure of the corpus cavernosum. The Dorsal artery of the penis (dorsalis penis) ascends between the two crura and symphysis pubis to the dorsum penis, and runs forward through the suspensory ligament, in the groove of the corpus cavernosum, to the glans, distributing branches in its course to the body of the organ and integument. The Internal pudic artery in the female is smaller than in the male; its branches, with their distribution, are, in principle, the same. The superficial perineal artery supplies the analogue of the lateral half of the scrotum, namely, the greater labium. The artery of the bulb supplies the vagina; the artery of the corpus caver- nosum, the cavernous body of the clitoris, and the arteria dorsalis clitoridis, the dorsum of that organ. Branches of the posterior trunk. The Ilio-lumbar artery (ileo-lombalis) ascends beneath the ex- ternal Uiac vessels and psoas muscle, to the posterior part of the crest of the ilium, where it divides into two branches, a lumbar branch which supplies the psoas and quadratus lumborum, and sends a ramuscule through the fifth intervertebral foramen to the spinal cord and its membranes; and an iliac branch (r. transver- salis) which passes across the iliac fossa to the crest of the ilium, where it inosculates with the lumbar arteries and circumflexa ilii. In its course it distributes branches to the iliacus and abdominal muscles. The Lateral sacral arteries (sacrales laterales) are generally364 GLUTEAL ARTEEY. two in number on each side, superior and inferior. The superior passes inwards to the first sacral foramen, and is distributed to the contents of the spinal canal, from which it escapes by the posterior sacral foramen, and supplies the integument on the dorsum of the sacrum. The inferior passes down by the side of the anterior sacral foramina to the coccyx; it first pierces and then rests upon the origin of the pyriformis, and sends branches into the sacral canal to supply the sacral nerves. Both arteries inosculate with each other and with the sacra media. The GrLUTEAL ARTERY (glut83a Superior) is the continuation of the posterior trunk of the internal iliac; it passes backwards between the lumbo-sacral and first sacral nerve through the upper part of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen and above the pyriformis muscle, and divides into three branches, superficial, deep superior, and deep inferior; while within the pelvis it gives ofi" some muscular twigs to the iliacus and pyriformis, and at its escape from the pelvis, a nu- tritious artery to the ilium. The Superficial branch passes backwards between the gluteus maxim us and medius, and is distributed to the gluteus maximus and to the integument of the gluteal and sacral region. The Deep superior branch passes forwards along the superior curved line of the ilium, between the gluteus medius and minimus to the anterior superior spinous process, where it inosculates with the superficial circumflexa ilii and external circumflex artery. There are frequently two arteries occupying the place of this branch. The Deep inferior branches, two or three in number, cross the gluteus minimus obliquely to the trochanter major, where they inosculate with branches of the external circumflex and ischiatic artery, and send branches through the gluteus minimus to supply the capsule of the hip-joint. Varieties in the Branches of the internal iliac.—The most im- portant of the varieties occurring among these branches is the origin of the dorsal artery of the penis from the internal iliac or ischiatic. The artery in this case passes forwards by the side of the prostate gland, and through the upper part of the transverse ligament of the perineum. It would be endangered in the operation of lithotomy. The dorsal artery of the penis is sometimes derived from the ob- turator, and sometimes from one of the external pudic arteries. The artery of the bulb, in its normal course, passes almost transversely inwards to the corpus spongiosum. Occasionally, however, it is so oblique in its direction as to render its division in lithotomy unavoidable. The obturator artery may be very small or altogether wanting, its place being supplied by a branch from the external iliac or epigastric.365 EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. The external iliac artery {iliaca externa; cruralis iliaca) of each side passes obliquely downwards along the inner border of the psoas muscle, from opposite the sacro-iliac symphysis to the femoral arch, where it becomes the femoral artery. Relations.—It is in relation in front with the spermatic vessels, peritoneum, and a thin layer of fascia, derived from the iliac fascia, which surrounds the artery and vein. At its commencement it is crossed by the ureter, and near its termination by the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve and the circumflexa ilii vein. Externally it lies against the psoas muscle, from which it is separated by the iliac fascia; and ^posteriorly it is in relation with the external iliac vein, which, at the femoral arch, becomes placed to its inner side. The artery is surrounded by lymphatic vessels and several glands. Branches.—Besides several small twigs which supply the lym- phatic glands and psoas muscle, the external iliac gives off two branches, the— Epigastric, i Circumflexa ilii. The Epigastric artery (epigastrica) arises from the front of the external iliac near Poupart's ligament; and passing inwards between the peritoneum and transversalis fascia, ascends obliquely to the sheath of the rectus. It enters the sheath near its lower third, passes upwards behind the rectus muscle, to which it is distributed, and in the substance of that muscle inosculates, near the ensiform cartilage, with the termination (superior epigastric) of the internal mammary artery. It lies internally to the internal abdominal ring and immediately above the femoral ring, and is crossed near its origin by the vas deferens in the male, and the round ligament in the female. The branches of the epigastric artery are, A cremasteric branch (spermatica externa) which accompanies the spermatic cord, and after supplying the cremaster muscle inosculates with the spermatic artery. A puhic branch which is distributed behind the pubes, and sends a small branch of communication downwards to the obturator artery. Muscular branches which pass outwards between the abdominal muscles, and inosculate with the circumflexa ilii, lumbar, and inferior intercostal arteries. Superficial branches, which pierce the rectus muscle and are dis- tributed to the integument of the abdomen. The epigastric artery forms a prominence of the peritoneum, which divides the inguinal fossa into an internal and an external portion; it is from the former that dii-ect inguinal hernia issues, and from the latter, oblique inguinal hernia.FEMORAL ARTERY. 366 The CiRCUMFLEXA iLii arises from the outer side of the external iliac, a little below the epigastric artery. It ascends obliquely along Poupart's lig^iment, and curving around the crest of the ilium, inosculates with the ilio-lumbar and inferior lumbar artery. In its course the artery pierces the crural sheath and then lies between the transversalis muscle and fascia; near its termination it pierces the transversalis muscle and becomes placed between it and the internal oblique. Opposite the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, it gives off a large ascending branch, which passes upwards between the internal oblique and transversalis, and divides into numerous branches which supply the abdominal muscles, and inos- culate with the inferior intercostal and with the lumbar arteries. Varieties in the branches of the external iliac.—The epigastric artery not unfrequently* gives off the obturator, which descends in contact with the external iliac vein, to the obturator foramen. In this situation the artery would lie to the outer side of the femoral ring, and would not be endangered in the operation of dividing the stricture of femoral hernia. But occasionally the obturator passes along the free margin of Gimbernat's ligament in its course to the obturator foramen, and would completely encircle the neck of the hernial sac, a position in which it could scarcely escape the knife of the operator. In a preparation now before me, the branch of com- munication between the epigastric and obturator arteries is very much enlarged, and takes this dangerous course. FEMORAL ARTERY. Emerging from beneath Poupart's ligament, the external iliac artery enters the thigh and becomes the femoral. The femoral artery (femoralis; cruralis) passes down the inner side of the thigh, from Poupart's ligament, at a point midway between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the symphysis pubis, to the opening in the adductor magnus, at the junction of the middle with the inferior third of the thigh, where it becomes the popliteal artery. The femoral artery and vein are enclosed in a strong sheath, femoral sheath, which is formed for the greater part of its extent, by aponeurotic and cellular tissue, and by a process of fascia sent inwards from the fascia lata. Near Poupart's ligament this sheath is much larger (infundibuliform) than the vessels it contains, and * The proportion in which, high diyision of the obturator artery from the epigastric occurs, is stated to be one in three. In two hundred and fifty sub- jects examined by Cloquet with a view to ascertain how frequently the high division took place, he found the obturator arising from the epigastric on both sides one hundred and fifty times; on one side twentv-eight times, and six times it arose from the femoral artery.FEMORAL ARTERY. 367 Fig. 146* is continiiOTis with the trans- versalis and Uiac fascia. If the sheath he opened at this point, the artery will be seen to be situated in con- tact with the onter wall of the sheath. The vein lies next the artery, being se- parated from it by a fibrous septum, and between the vein and the inner wall of the sheath, and divided from the vein by another thin fibrous septum, is a trian- gular interval {femoral or crural canal), into which the sac is protruded in fe- moral hernia. This space is occupied in the normal state of the parts by loose cellular tissue, and by lymphatic vessels which pierce the inner wall of the sheath * Anterior and inner aspect of the thigh, with the femoral ar- tery. 1.

Relations.—The upper third of the femoral artery is superficial, being covered only by the integument, inguinal glands, and super- ficial and deep fascia. The lower two-thirds are covered by the sartorius muscle. To its outer side the artery is in relation with the psoas and vastus internus. Behind, it rests upon the inner border of the psoas; it is next separated from the pectineus by the femoral vein, profunda vein and artery, and then lies on the adductor longus to its termination; near the lower border of the adductor longus it is placed in an aponeurotic sheath or canal, formed by an arch of tendinous fibres, thrown from the border of the adductor longus and the border of the opening in the adductor magnus, to the side of the vastus internus. To its inner side it is in relation at its upper part with the femoral vein, and lower down with the pectineus, adductor longus, and sartorius. The immediate relations of the artery are the femoral vein, long saphenous nerve, and muscular nerve to the vastus internus. The vein at Poupart's ligament lies to the inner side of the artery; but lower down gets altogether behind it, and inclines to its outer side. The muscular nerve lies to the outer side, and somewhat upon the sheath for the lower two-thirds of its extent; and the long saphe- nous nerve is situated within the sheath, and in front of the artery for the same extent.

It supplies the integument of the groin, superficial fascia, and inguinal glands. The Superficial ep>igastric (epigastrica superficialis) arises from the femoral immediately below Poupart's ligament, pierces the fascia lata, and ascends obliquely towards the umbilicus between the two layers of superficial fascia. It distributes branches to the inguinal glands and integument, and inosculates with branches of the deep epigastric and internal mammary artery. The Superior external pudic (pudenda externa, superior) arises near the superficial epigastric artery; it pierces the fascia lata at the saphenous opening, and passes transversely inwards, crossing the spermatic cord, to be distributed to the integument of the penis and scrotum (r. scrotales anteriores) in the male, and to the labia (r. labiales anteriores) in the female. The Inferior external pudic (pudenda externa, inferior) arises from the femoral a little below, ajid sometimes in common with, the preceding; it crosses the femoral vein immediately below the termi- nation of the internal saphenous vein, and resting on the pectineus muscle reaches the inner border of the thigh, where it pierces the fascia lata, and is distributed to the integument of the external organs of generation and perineum. Both external pudics inosculate with the internal pudic artery. The Profunda femoris (femoralis profunda) arises from the outer side of the femoral artery about one inch and a half below Poupart's ligament; it passes downwards and backwards and a little outwards, behind the adductor longus muscle, pierces the adductor magnus, and is distributed to the flexor muscles on the posterior part of the thigh.

Relations.—In its course downwards it rests successively on the B BPKOPUNDA FEMORIS ARTERY. 370 pectineus, the conjoined tendon of tlie psoas and iliacus, adductor brevis, and adductor magnus. To its outer side the tendinous in- sertion of the vastus internus muscle intervenes between it and the femur; on its inner side it is in relation with the pectineus, ad- ductor brevis, and adductor magnus; and in front it is separated from the femoral artery, above by the profunda vein and femoral vein, and helov: by the adductor longus muscle. Branches.—The branches of the profunda artery are, the external circumflex, internal circumflex, and three perforating arteries. The External circum-flex artery (circumflexa femoris externa) passes outwards beneath the sartorius and rectus and in front of the crureus muscle, passing between the divisions of the crural nerve, and divides into three sets of branches; ascending, which pass upwards beneath the sartorius, rectus, and tensor vaginae femoris, and inosculate with the terminal branches of the gluteal artery; descending, which pass downwards beneath the rectus muscle to inosculate with the superior articular arteries of the popliteal; and middle, which continue the original course of the artery around the thigh, pierce the vastus externus, and anastomose with branches of the ischiatic, internal circumflex, and superior perforating artery. It supplies the muscles of the anterior and outer side of the thigh. The Internal circumflex artery (circumflexa femoris interna) winds around the inner side of the neck of the femur, passing be- tween the pectineus and psoas, and over the upper border of the adductor brevis to the tendon of the obturator externus, which it accompanies to the space between the quadratus femoris and upper border of the adductor magnus. While on the obturator externus it gives off a branch which is distributed to that muscle, the adductor brevis and gracilis, and anastomoses with the obturator artery. It next gives off an articular branch, which enters the hip-joint through the notch in the acetabulum; and terminates in several branches which inosculate with the ischiatic, external circumflex, and superior perforating artery. The Superior perforating artery passes backwards near the lower border of the pectineus, pierces the adductor brevis and magnus near the femur, and is distributed to the posterior muscles of the thigh; inosculating with the circumflex, ischiatic, and middle perforating artery. The Middle perforating artery pierces the tendons of the ad- ductor brevis and magnus, and is distributed like the superior; inosculating with the superior and inferior perforating. From this branch is given off the nutritious artery of the femur. The Inferior perforating artery is given off below the adductor brevis, and pierces the tendon of the adductor magnus, supplying it and the flexor muscles, and inosculating with the middle perforating artery above, and with the articular branches of the popliteal below. It is through the medium of the branches of the profunda whichPOPLITEAL ARTEKY. 371 inosculate above with branches of the internal iliac, and below with those of the popliteal artery, that the collateral circulation is main- tained in the limb after ligature of the femoral artery. The Muscular branches are given off by the femoral artery throughout the whole of its course. They supply the muscles in immediate proximity with the artery, particularly those of the an- terior aspect of the thigh. One of these branches, larger than the rest, arises from the femoral immediately below the origin of the profunda, and passing outwards between the sartorius and rectus, divides into branches, which are distributed to all the muscles of the anterior aspect of the thigh. This may be named the superior muscular artery. The Anastomotica magna (articularis genu superficialis) arises from the femoral near its termination at the opening in the adductor magnus, and divides into a superficial and deep branch. The su2oerficial branch accompanies the internal saphenous nerve to the knee, and piercing the fascia lata is distributed to the integument. The deep branch passes onwards through the substance of the vasttjs internus muscle and resting on the tendon of the adductor magnus to the knee, where it inosculates with the internal articular branches of the popliteal, and the recurrent of the anterior tibial. It also sends a branch through the vastus internus, which supplies the synovial membrane of the joint, and inosculates with the superior external articular artery and external circumflex. The popliteal artery (poplitea. Fig. 148) commences from the termination of the femoral at the opening in the adductor magnus muscle, and passes obliquely outwards through the middle of the popliteal space to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it divides into the anterior and posterior tibial artery.

Superficially it is in relation with the semi-membranosus muscle, next with a quantity of fat which sepa- rates it from the deep fascia, and near its termination with the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus; superficial and external to it is the popliteal vein, and still more superficial and external the popliteal nerve. By its inner side it is in relation with the semi- membranosus, internal condyle of the femur, and inner head of the gastrocnemius; and by its outer side with the biceps, external con- dyle of the femur, outer head of the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus. Branches.—The branches of the popliteal artery are the— Superior external articular, Inferior external articular, Superior internal articular, Inferior internal articular, Azygos articular. Sural. The Superior articular arteries (articulares genu superiores) ; external and internal, wind around the femur, immediately above the condyles, to the front of the knee-joint, anastomosing with each other, with the external circumflex, anastomotica magna, inferior articular, and recurrent of the anterior tibial. The external passes beneath the tendon of the biceps, and the internal through an arched opening beneath the tendon of the adductor magnus. They supply the knee-joint and lower part of the femur, and give branches to the vasti muscles. The Azygos articular artery (articularis genu media) pierces the posterior ligament of the joint, the ligamentum posticum Winslowii, and supplies the crucial ligaments and synovial membrane. There are, frequently, several posterior articular arteries. The Inferior articular arteries (articulares genu inferiores) wind around the head of the tibia immediately below the joint, and anas- tomose with each other, the superior articular arteries, and the recurrent of the anterior tibial. The external passes beneath the two external lateral ligaments of the joint, the internal beneath the internal lateral ligament. They supply the knee-joint and the heads of the tibia and fibula. The Sural arteries (surales; sura, the calf) are two muscular branches of large size, distributed to the two heads of the gastrocne- mius muscle. Other muscular branches are given off from the upper part of the popliteal artery to supply the hamstring muscles.873 ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. The anterior tibial artery {tibialis antica), passes forwards be- tween the two beads of the tibialis posticus muscle, and tbrougb tbe opening in the upper part of the interosseous membrane, to the anterior tibial region. It then runs down the anterior aspect of the leg to the ankle-joint, where it becomes the dorsalis pedis. Relations.—In its course it rests upon the interosseous membrane (to which it is connected by a little tendinous arch which is thrown across it), the lower part of the tibia, and the anterior ligament of the joint. In its upper third it is situated between the tibialis anticus and extensor longus digitorum, lower down between the tibialis anticus and extensor proprius pollicisj and just before it reaches the ankle it is crossed by the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis, and becomes placed between that tendon and the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum. Its immediate relations are the vense comites and the anterior tibial nerve ; the latter lies at first to its outer side, at about the middle of the leg it becomes placed superficially to the artery, and at the ankle it is again at its outer side^ ' Plan of the Relations of the Anterior Tibial Artery, Front.

The Muscular branches are numerous, they supply the muscles of the anterior tibial region. The Malleolar arteries (malleolares anteriores) are distributed to the ankle-joint; the external, passing beneath the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius, inosculates withDORSALIS PEDIS ARTEKY. 374 Fig. 147. -12 the anterior peroneal artery and dorsalis pedis; the internal, be- neath the tendons of the exten- sor proprius poUicis and tibialis anticus, inosculates with branches of the posterior tibial and inter- nal plantar artery. They supply branches to the ankle-joint. The Dorsalis pedis artery is continued forward along the tibial side of the dorsum of the foot, from the ankle to the base of the meta- tarsal bone of the great toe, where it gives off a branch, the dorsalis hallucis, and then dips between the two heads of the first dorsal inter- osseous muscle into the sole of the foot and becomes continuous with the deep plantar arch. Relations.—The dorsahs pedis is situated along the outer border of the tendon of the extensor proprius poUicis ; on its fibular side is the innermost tendon of the extensor longus digitorum, and near its ter- mination it is crossed by the inner tendon of the extensor brevis digi- torum. It is accompanied by venae comites, and has the continuation of the anterior tibial nerve to its outer side. * Ajiterior aspect of the leg and foot, showing the anterior tibial and dor- salis pedis artery; the tibialis anticus has been removed. 1.

The Tarsea (externa) arches transversely across the tarsus, beneath the extensor brevis digitorum muscle, and supplies the arti- culations of the tarsal bones and the outer side of the foot: it anas- tonjioses with the external malleolar, peroneal arteries and external plantar. The Metatarsea forms an arch (arcus tarseus vel dorsalis pedis) across the base of the metatarsal bones, and supplies the outer side of the foot; anastomosing with the tarsea and external plantar artery. From its convex side the metatarsea gives off three branches, the interossece, which pass forward upon the dorsal interossei muscles, and divide into branches (dorsal collateral) for the supply of the sides of the toes between which they are placed. At their commencement these interosseous branches receive the pos- terior perforating arteries from the plantar arch, and opposite the heads of the metatarsal bones are joined by the anterior perforating branches from the digital arteries. The interosseous artery of the fourth interosseous space in addition to the two dorsal collateral branches into which it bifurcates sends a third to the outer side of the little toe. The Dorsalis hallucis (interossea dorsalis prima) inins forward upon the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and at the base of the first phalanx divides into two branches, one of which passes in- wards beneath the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis, and is distributed to the inner border of the great toe, while the other bifurcates into two collateral branches for the supply of the adjacent sides of the great and second toe. The Arteria magna pollicis arises from the dorsalis pedis, while in the metatarsal space and just before its inosculation with the external plantar artery. It sends a digital branch to the inner border of the great toe on its plantar aspect, and bifurcates to supply the collateral digital branches of the great and second toe.376 POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. The posterior tibial artery (tibialispostica) passes obliquely dowTi- wards along the tibial side of the leg from the lower border of the popliteus muscle to the concavity of the os calcis, where it diTides into the internal and external plantar artery. Relations.—In its course it lies first upon the tibialis posticus, next on the flexor longus digitorum, and then on the tibia; it is coTored in by the intermuscular fascia which separates it above from the soleus, and below from the deep fascia of the leg and the integument. It is accompanied by its venae comites, and by the posterior tibial nerve, which lies to its inner side at first, and to its outer side in the rest of its course.

Branches.—The branches of the posterior tibial artery are the— Peroneal, Internal calcanean, Nutritious, Internal plantar, Muscular, External plantar. The Peroneal Artery (peronsea ; fibularis) is given off from the posterior tibial at about two inches below the lower border of the popliteus muscle ; it is nearly as large as the anterior tibial artery, and passes obKquely outwards to the fibula. It then runs down- wards along the initer border of the fibula to its lower third, where it divides into the anterior and posterior peroneal. Relations.—The peroneal artery rests upon the tibialis posticus muscle, and is covered in by the soleus, intermuscular fascia, and flexor longus pollicis, having the fibula to its outer side. Branches.—The branches of the peroneal artery are, muscular to the neighbouring muscles, particularly the soleus : mitHent to the fibula; and two terminal branches anterior and posterior peroneal. The Anterior peroneal aHery (perontea antica vel perforans) pierces the interosseous membrane at the lower third of the leg, and is distributed on the front of the outer malleolus, anastomosing with the external malleolar and tarsal artery.POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. 377 The Posterior peroneal continties onwards along the posterior aspect of the outer malleolus to the side of the OS calcis, to which and to the muscles arising from it, it distri- butes external calcanean branches. It anastomoses with the anterior peroneal, tarsal, external plantar, and posterior tibial artery; with the latter by means of a small transv^se branch (r. anastomoticus trans versus). The Nutritious artery (nutritia tibise) of the tibia arises from the trunk of the posterior tibial, fre- quently above the origin of the pe- roneal, and proceeds to the nutri- tious canal, which it traverses ob- liquely from below upwards. The Muscular branches of the posterior tibial artery are distri- buted to the soleus and deep mus- cles on the posterior aspect of the leg. One of these branches is deserving of notice, a recurrent Fig. 148.* * Posterior view of tlie leg, showing /4-' the popliteal and posterior tibial ar- tery. 1. Tendons of the inner hamstring, 2.

The Internal calcanean branches, three or four in number, pro- ceed from the posterior tibial artery immediately before its division ; they are distributed to the inner side of the os calcis, to the integu- ment, and to the muscles which arise from its inner tuberosity ; and anastomose with the external calcanean branches of the poste- rior peroneal, and with all the neighbouring arteries, forming around the heel a network of inosculations, rete calcaneum^ PLANTAR ARTERIES. The Internal plantar artery (plantaris interna) proceeds from the bifurcation of the posterior tibial at the inner malleolus, and passes along the inner border of the foot beneath the abductor pollicis, supplying the inner border of the foot and great toe. The External plantar artery (plantaris externa), much larger than the internal, passes obliquely outwards between the first and second layers of the plantar muscles, to the fifth metatarsal space. It then turns horizontally inwards between the second and third layer, to the first metatarsal space, where it inosculates with the dorsalis pedis. The horizontal portion of the artery describes a slight curve, having the convexity forwards; this is the plantar arch (arcus plantaris). Branches,—The branches of the external plantar artery are the— Muscular, -p. .^^^ f collateral, Articular, (anterior perforating. Posterior perforating. The Muscular and Articular branches are distributed to the muscles in the sole of the foot and to the articulations of the tarsus. The Digital branches (interossese plantares) are four in number : the first is distributed to the outer side of the little toe ; the three others pass forward to the cleft between the toes, and divide into collateral branches, which supply the adjacent sides of the three external toes, and the outer side of the second. At the bifurcation of the toes, a small branch is sent upwards from each digital artery, to inosculate with the interosseous branches of the metatarsea; these are the anterior perforating arteries. The Posterior perforating are three small branches which pass upwards between the heads of the three external dorsal interossei muscles, to inosculate with the arch formed by the metatarsea artery. Varieties in the Arteries of the Lower Extremity.—The femoral artery occasionally divides at Poupart's ligament into two branches, and sometimes into three ; the former is an instance of the high379 PLANTAR ARTERIES. Fig. 149 * division of the profunda artery; and in a case of the latter kind which occurred during my dissections, the branches were the profunda, the superficial femoral, and the internal circumflex artery. Dr. Jones Quain, in his "Elements of Anatomy," records an instance of high division of the femoral artery, in which the two vessels became again united in the popliteal region. The point of origin of the profunda artery varies considerably in difi'erent sub- jects, being sometimes nearer to and sometimes farther from Pou- part's ligament, but more frequently the former. The branches of the popliteal artery are very liable to variety in size; and in all these cases the compensating principle, so constant in the vascular system, is manifested. When the anterior tibial is of small size, the peroneal is large; and, in place of dividing into two terminal branches at the lower third of the leg, de- scends to the lower part of the in- terosseous membrane, and emerges upon the front of the ankle, to sup- ply the dorsum of the foot ; or the posterior tibial and plantar arteries are large, and the external plantar is continued between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, to be distributed to the dorsal sur- face of the foot. Sometimes the posterior tibial artery is small and thread-like; and the peroneal, after descending to the ankle, curves in- wards to the inner malleolus, and divides into the two plantar arteries. If, in this case, the posterior tibial be sufficiently large to reach the ankle, it inosculates with the pe- roneal previously to its division. The internal plantar artery some- times takes the distribution of the external plantar, which is short and diminutive, and the latter not un- frequently replaces a deficient dor- salis pedis. * Arteries of the sole of the foot; the first and part of the second layer of muscles having been removed. 1.

The varieties of arteries are interesting in the practical application of a knowledge of their principal forms to surgical operations : in their transcendental anatomy, as illustrating the normal type of dis- tribution in animals ; or, in many cases, as diverticula permitted by Nature, to teach her observers two important principles :—-first, in respect to herself, that, however in her means she may indulge in change, the end is never overlooked, and a limb is as surely supplied by a leash of arteries, various in their course, as by those which we are pleased to consider normal in distribution; and secondly, with regard to us, that we should ever be keenly alive to what is passing beneath our observation, and ever ready in the most serious opera- tion to deviate from our course, and avoid—or give eyes to our knife, that it may see—the concealed dangers which it is our pride to be able to contend with and vanquish. PULMONARY ARTERY. The pulmonary artery [arteria pulmonalis) arises from the left side of the base of the right ventricle in front of the origin of the aorta, and ascends obliquely for the space of two inches to the under surface of the arch of the aorta, where it divides into the right and left pulmonary artery. In its course upwards and backwards it inclines to the left side, crossing the commencement of the aorta, and is connected by its left branch to the under surface of the arch by a thick and impervious cord (ligamentum arteriosum ; chorda ductus arteriosi), the remains of the ductus arteriosus of the foetus. Relations.—It is enclosed for nearly the whole of its extent by the pericardium, and receives the attachment of the fibrous portion of that membrane by its upper portion. Behind, it rests against the ascending portion of the arch of the aorta and left auricle, on either side is the appendix of the corresponding auricle with a coronary artery; and above, the superficial cardiac plexus, and the cord of the ductus arteriosus. The Right pulmonary artery, longer and somewhat larger than the left, passes transversely outwards behind the ascending aorta and superior vena cava to the root of the right lung, where it divides into three branches for the three lobes. In its course it lies parallel with and in front of the right bronchus. The Left pulmonary artery, shorter and smaller than the right, crosses the descending aorta and left bronchus to the root of the left lung, where it divides into two branches for the two lobes. The pulmonary arteries divide and subdivide in the structure of the lungs, and terminate in capillary vessels which form a network around the air-passages and cells, and become continuous with the radicles of the pulmonary veins.381 PULMONARY ARTERY. ■ Relations. —In the root of the right lung, examined from above downwards, the pulmonary artery is situated between the bronchus and puhnonary veins, the former being above, the latter beloM^; in the root of the left lung the artery is highest, next the bronchus, and then the veins. On both sides, from before backwards, the artery is situated between the veins and bronchi, the former being in front, the latter behind.■ w 382 CHAPTEE VI. OF THE VEINS. The veins are the vessels wMch return the blood to the auricles of the heart, after it has been circulated by the arteries through the various tissues of the body. They are much thinner in structure than the arteries, so that when emptied of their blood they become flattened and collapsed. The veins of the systemic circulation con- vey the dark-coloured and impure or venous blood from the capillary system to the right auricle of the heart, and they are found after death to be more or less distended with that fluid. The veins of the pulmonary circulation resemble the arteries of the systemic circula- tion in containing during life the pure or arterial blood, which they transmit from the capillaries of the lungs to the left auricle. The veins commence by minute radicles in the capillaries which are everywhere distributed through the textures of the body, and converge to constitute larger and larger branches, till they terminate in the main trunks which convey the venous blood directly to the heart. In diameter they are larger than the arteries, and, like those vessels, their combined arese would constitute a hollow cone, whereof the apex is placed at the heart, and the base at the surface of the body. It follows from this arrangement, that the blood in returning to the heart is passing from a larger into a smaller channel, and therefore that it increases in rapidity during its course. Veins admit of a threefold division into superficial, deep, and sinuses. The Superficial veins return the blood from the integument and superficial structures, and take their course between the layers of the superficial fascia; they then pierce the deep fascia in the most convenient and protected situations, and terminate in the deep veins. They are unaccompanied by arteries, and are the vessels usually selected for venesection. The Deep veins are situated among the deeper structures of the body, and generally in relation with the arteries; in the limbs they are enclosed in the same sheath with those vessels, and they return the venous blood from the capillaries of the deep tissues. In company with all the smaller, and also with the secondary arteries, as the brachial, radial, and ulnar in the upper, and the tibial and peroneal in the lower extremity, there are two veins, placed one on each sideSTRUCTURE OF VEINS. 383 of the artery, and named vence comites. The larger arteries, as the axillary, subclavian, carotid, popliteal, femoral, &c., are accompanied by a single venous trunk. Sinuses differ from veins in their struc- ture; and also in their mode of distribution, being confined to especial organs and situated within their substance. The principal venous sinuses are those of the dura mater, diploe, cancellous struc- ture of bones, and uterus. The communications between veins are more frequent than those of arteries, and they take place between the larger as well as the smaller vessels; the vense comites communicate with each other in their course by means of short transverse branches which pass across from one to the other. These communications are strikingly ex- hibited in the frequent inosculations of the spinal veins, and in the various venous plexuses, as the spermatic plexus, vesical plexus, &c. The office of these inosculations is very apparent, as tending to obviate the obstructions to which veins are particularly liable from the thinness of their coats, and from their inability to overcome much impediment by the force of their current. Veins, like arteries, are composed of three coats, external or cellulo-fibrous, middle or fibrous, and internal or serous. The ex- ternal coat is firm and strong, and resembles that of arteries. The middle coat consists of two layers, an outer layer of contractile fibrous tissue disposed in a circular direction around the vessel, and an inner layer of organic muscular fibres arranged longitudinally. This latter resembles the inner layer of the middle coat of arteries, but is somewhat thicker; it is not unfrequently hypertrophied. The internal coat, as in arteries, consists of a striated or fenestrated layer, and a layer of epithelium; it is continuous with the internal coat of arteries through the medium of the lining membrane of the heart on the one hand, and through the capillary vessels on the other. The differences in structure, therefore, between arteries and veins, relate to the difference of thickness of their component layers, and to the absence of the elastic coat in the latter. Moreover, another difference occurs in the presence of valves. The valves of veins are composed of a thin layer of fibrous membrane, lined upon its two surfaces by epithelium. The segments or flaps of the valves of veins are semilunar in form, and arranged in pairs, one upon either side of the vessel; in some instances there is but a single flap, which has a spiral direction, and occasionally there are three. The free border of the valvular flaps is concave, and directed for- wards, so that while the current of blood is permitted to flow freely towards the heart, the valves are distended, and the current inter- cepted, if the stream become retrograde in its course. Upon the cardiac side of each valve the vein is expanded into two pouches (sinuses), corresponding with the flaps of the valves, which give to the distended or injected vein a knotted appearance. The valves are most numerous in the veins of the extremities, particularly in the deeper veins, and they are generally absent in the very small384 VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. veins, and in the veins of the viscera, as in the portal and cerebral veins; they are also absent in the large trunks, as in the vense cavee, vense azygos, innominatse, and iliac veins. Sinuses are venous channels, excavated in the structure of an organ, and lined by the internal coat of the veins; of this structure are the sinuses of the dura mater, whose external covering is the fibrous tissue of the membrane, and the internal, the serous layer of the veins. The external investment of the sinuses of the uterus is the tissue of that organ; and that of the bones^ the lining mem- brane of the cells and canals. Veins, like arteries, are supplied with nutritious vessels, the vasa vasorum; and it is to be presumed that nervous filaments are dis- tributed in their coats. I shall describe the veins according to the primary division of the body; taking first, those of the head and neck; next, those of the upper extremity; then, those of the lower extremity; and lastly, the veins of the trunk. The veins of the head and neck may be arranged into three groups, namely, veins of the exterior of the head, veins of the diploe and interior of the cranium, veins of the neck. The veins of the exterior of the head are the— The Facial vein (facialis anterior) commences on the anterior part of the head in a venous plexus, formed by the communications of the branches of the temporal, and descends along the middle line of the forehead, under the name of frontal vein, to the root of the nose, where it is connected with its fellow of the opposite side by a communicating trunk, the nasal arch. There are usually two frontal veins, which communicate by a transverse inosculation; but sometimes the vein is single and bifurcates at the root of the nose, into the two angular veins. From the nasal arch the frontal is continued downwards by the side of the root of the nose, and near the angle of the eye, under the name of the angular vein; it then passes beneath the zygomatic muscles, and becomes the facial vein, and descends along the anterior border of the masseter muscle, crossing the body of the lower jaw by the side of the facial artery, to the submaxillary gland, and from thence to the internal jugular vein, in which it terminates. The branches which the facial vein receives in its course are, the supra-orhital, which joins the frontal vein; the dorsal veins of the VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK, Facial, Internal maxillary, Temporal, Temporo-maxillary, Posterior auricular, Occipital.VEINS OF THE DIPLOE, 385 nose, whicli terminate in the nasal arch; the ophthalmic, which commnnicates with the angular vein; ihe palpebral and nasal, which open into the angular vein; a considerable trunk, the (ieep facial (maxillaris interna anterior), which returns the blood from the spheno-maxillary fossa^ from the infraorbital, palatine, vidian, and spheno-palatine veins, and joins the facial beneath the zygo- matic process of the superior maxillary bone; and the veins corre- sponding with the branches of the facial artery. The Internal maxillary vein receives the branches from the zygomatic and pterygoid fossa; these are so numerous and commu- nicate so freely as to constitute a pterygoid plexus. Passing back- wards behind the neck of the lower jaw, the internal maxillary joins with the temporal vein. The Temporal vein commences on the vertex of the head by a plexiform network, which is continuous with the frontal, opposite temporal, auricular, and occipital vein. The ramifica,tions of this plexus form an anterior and a posterior branch which unite im- mediately above the zygoma; the trunk is here joined by another large vein, the middle temporal, which collects the blood from the temporal muscle and outer segment of the orbit, and pierces the temporal fascia near the root of the zygoma. The temporal vein then descends in the substance of the parotid gland to the angle of the lower jaw, where it divides into two trunks, one of which, mounting upon the sterno-mastoideus muscle, constitutes the ex- ternal jugular vein; while the other, uniting with the facial vein, becomes the tempore-maxillary vein. The temporal vein receives the anterior auricidar, masseteric, transverse facial, and parotid veins. The Teraporo-maxillary vein, a short trunk formed by the union of the temporo-maxillary trunk and facial vein, sends a branch to the anterior jugular, and terminates in the internal jugular vein. It receives the lingual, laryngeal, and superior thyroid vein. The Posterior auricular vein communicates with the plexus of the vertex of the head, and descends behind the ear to join the external jugular vein near its origin. It receives in its course the veins of the external ear and the stylo-mastoid vein. The Occipital vein commencing posteriorly in the plexus of the vertex of the head, follows the direction of the occipital artery, and passing deeply beneath the muscles of the back part of the neck, terminates in the external or internal jugular vein. This vein communicates with the lateral sinus by means of a large branch which passes through the mastoid foramen, the mastoid vein. VEINS OP THE DIPLOE. The diploe of the bones of the head is furnished in the adult with irregular sinuses {ven<B diploeticce), which are formed by a continu- ation of the internal coat of the veins into the osseous canals in which they are lodged. At the middle period of life these sinuses c cCEREBRAL AND CEREBELLAR VEINS, 386 are confined to separate bones ; but in old age, after tbe ossification of the sutnres, they may be traced from one bone to the next. They receive their blood from the capillaries supplying the cellular structure of the diploe, and terminate externally in the veins of the pericranium, internally, in the veins and sinuses of the dura mater; they are separated from the bony walls of the canals by a thin layer of medulla. Breschet describes four of these diploetic veins, namely, frontalis, temporalis anterior, temporalis posterior, and occipitalis. The diploetica frontalis, the smallest of the four, escapes from the frontal bone at the supraorbital notch, and opens into the supra- orbital vein. The temporalis anterior also collects the blood from the frontal bone, and terminates either in the deep temporal veins or. in the cavernous sinus. The temporalis posterior commences in the parietal bone, and opens into the lateral sinus, sometimes send- ing a branch outwards to the veins of the scalp. The occipitalis, the largest of the four, originates in the occipital bone, and termi- nates in the occipital sinus, or externally in the occipital vein. CEREBRAL AND CEREBELLAR VEINS. The cerebral veins are remarkable for the absence of valves, and for the extreme tenuity of their coats. They may be arranged into the superficial, and deep or ventricular veins. The Superficial cerebral veins are situated on the surface of the hemispheres lying in the grooves formed by the convexities of the convolutions. They are named from the position which they may chance to occupy upon the surface of this organ, either superior or inferior, internal or external, anterior or posterior. The Superior cerebral veins, seven or eight in number on each side, pass obliquely forwards, and terminate in the superior longi- tudinal sinus, in the opposite direction to the course of the stream of blood in the sinus. In the infant the direction of these veins is nearly transverse. The Deep or Ventricular veins commence within the lateral ventricles by the veins of the corpora striata and those of the choroid plexus, which unite to form the two vense Graleni. The VencB Galeni pass backwards in the structure of the velum interpositum ; and escaping through the fissure of Bichat, terminate in the straight sinus. The Cerebellar veins are disposed, like those of the cerebrum, on the surface of the lobes of the cerebellum ; they are situated, some on the superior, and some on the inferior surface, whUe others occupy the borders of the organ. They terminate in the lateral and petrosal sinuses.387 SINUSES OP THE DURA MATER. The sinuses of the dura mater are irregular channels, formed by the splitting of the layers of that membrane, and liaed upon their inner surface by a continuation of the internal coat of the veins. They may be divided into two groups—those situated at the upper and back part of the skull, and those of the base of the skull. The former are, the Superior longitudinal sinus, Occipital sinuses. Inferior longitudinal sinus. Lateral sinuses. Straight sinus, The Superior longitudinal drms is situated in the attached margin of the falx cerebri, and extends along the middle line of the arch of the skull, from the foramen caecum in the frontal, to the inner tuberosity of the occipital bone, where it divides into the two lateral sinuses. It is triangular in form, is small in front, and increases gradually in size as it passes backwards ; it receives Fig. 150.* * Sinuses of the upper and back part of the skull. 1.

Examined in its interior, it presents numerous transverse fibrous bands (trabeculss) the chordce Willisii, which are stretched across its inferior angle ; and some small white granular masses, the glandulce Pacchioni; the oblique openings of the cerebral veins, with their valve-like margin, are also seen on the walls of the sinus. The termination of the superior longitudinal sinus in the two lateral sinuses forms a considerable dilatation, into which the straight sinus opens from the front, and the occipital sinuses from below. This dilatation is named the torcular Herophili, * and is the point of communication of six sinuses, the superior longitudinal, two lateral, two occipital, and the straight. The Inferior longitudinal sinus is situated in the free margin of the falx cerebri; it is cylindrical in form, and extends from near the crista galli to the anterior border of the tentorium, where it terminates in the straight sinus. It receives in its course several veins from the falx and sometimes one or two from the internal surface of the hemispheres. The Straight or fourth sinus (sinus tentorii) is the sinus of the tentorium; it is situated at the line of union of the falx with the tentorium ; is prismoid in form, and extends across the tentorium, from the termination of the inferior longitudinal sinus to the torcular Herophili. It receives the vense Graleni, the cerebral veins from the inferior part of the posterior lobes, and the superior cerebellar veins. The Occipital sinuses (occipitales posteriores), are two canals of small size, situated in the attached border of the falx cerebelli ; they commence by several small veins around the foramen magnum, and terminate by separate openings in the torcular Herophili. They not unfrequently communicate with the termination of the lateral sinuses. The Lateral sinuses (sinus transversi, vel laterales), commencing at the torcular Herophili, pass horizontally outwards, in the at- tached margin of the tentorium, and then curve downwards and inwards along the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, at each side, to the foramina lacera posteriora, where they terminate in the internal jugular veins. Each sinus rests in its course on the transverse groove of the occipital bone, posterior inferior angle of the parietal, mastoid portion of the temporal, and again on the occipital bone. They receive the cerebral veins from the inferior surface of the posterior lobes, the inferior cerebellar veins, superior * Torcular (a press), from a supposition entertained by the older anatomists that the columns of blood, coming in different directions, compressed each other at this point.389 CAVERNOUS SINUSES. petrosal sinuses, mastoid and posterior condyloid vein. These sinuses are often unequal in size, the right being larger than the left. The sinuses of the base of the skull are the— Cavernous, Superior petrosal, Inferior petrosal, Transverse. Circular, The Cavernous sinuses are named from presenting a structure similar to that of the corpus cavernosum penis. They are situated on each side of the sella turcica, receiving, anteriorly, the ophthalmic veins through the sphenoidal fissures, and terminating posteriorly in the inferior petrosal sinuses. In the external wall of each cavernous sinus is the internal carotid artery, several filaments of the carotid plexus, the third, fourth, ophthalmic, and sixth nerve. These structures are separated from the blood flowing through the sinus, by the tubular lining membrane. Besides the ophthalmic vein the Fig. 151.* * Sinuses of the base of the skull. 1.

The cavernous sinuses communicate by means of the ophthalmic with the facial veins, by the circular sinus with each other, and by the superior petrosal with the lateral sinuses. The Inferior petrosal sinuses are the continuations of the cavern- ous sinuses backwards along the lower border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone at each side of the base of the skull, to the foramina lacera posteriora, where they terminate with the lateral sinuses in the commencement of the internal jugular veins. The Circular sinus (sinus of Eidley; ellipticus) is situated in the sella turcica, surrounding the pituitary gland, and communicating on each side with the cavernous sinus. The posterior segment is larger than the anterior. The Su/perior petrosal sinuses pass obliquely backwards along the attached border of the tentorium, on the upper margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and establish a communication between the cavernous and lateral sinus at each side. They receive one or two cerebral veins from the inferior part of the middle lobes, and a cerebellar vein from the anterior border of the cerebellum. Near the extremity of the petrous bone these sinuses cross the oval aperture which transmits the fifth nerve. Hhe Transverse sinus (basilaris; occipitalis anterior) passes trans- versely across the basilar process of the occipital bone, forming a communication between the two inferior petrosal sinuses. Some- times there are two sinuses in this situation, or, more properly, a plexus. The veins of the neck which return the blood from the head are the— The External jugular vein, the continuation of the superficial division of the tempore-maxillary, augmented by the junction of the posterior auricular, and sometimes of the occipital, commences at the lower border of the parotid gland, in front of the sterno-mastoid muscle. It descends the neck in the direction of a line drawn from the angle of the lower jaw to the middle of the clavicle, crosses the sterno-mastoid, and terminates, near the posterior and inferior attachment of that muscle, in the subclavian vein. In its course downwards it lies upon the anterior lamella of the deep cervical fascia, which separates it from the stemo-mastoid muscle, and is covered in by the platysma myoides and superficial fascia; at the VEINS OF THE NECK. External jugular, Anterior jugular, Internal jugular, Vertebral.391 JUaULAR VEINS. root of the neck it pierces the deep cervical fascia. It is accom- panied, for the Tipper half of its course, by the auricularis magnus nerve. The branches which it receives are the occipital cutaneous and posterior cervical cutaneous, and, near its termination, the supra and posterior scapular. The externa] jugular vein is variable in si^e, and occasionally re- placed by two veins. The Anterior jugular vein commences on the os hyoides by several small veins and by a branch from the tempore-maxillary, and passes downwards along the midline of the neck to the sternum; it then turns outwards behind the lower part of the sterno-mastoideus and opens into the subclavian vein, near the termination of the external jugular. The two veins communicate with each other, and with the external and internal jugular vein. The Internal jugular vein, formed by the convergence of the lateral and inferior petrosal sinus, commences at the foramen lace- rum posterius on each side of the base of the skull, by a dilatation (bulbus vense jugularis), and descends the side of the neck, lying, in the first instance, to the outer side of the internal carotid, then upon the outer side of the common carotid artery to the root of the neck;, where it unites with the subclavian, and constitutes the vena innominata. At its commencement, the internal jugular vein is posterior and external to the internal carotid artery and eighth pair of nerves, the hypoglossal nerve being behind it; lower down, the vein and artery are on the same plane, the glosso-pharyngeal and hypoglossal nerve passing forwards between them, the pneumogastric being between and behind in the same sheath, and the nervus accessorius crossing obliquely behind or before the vein at its upper part. The Branches which the internal jugular receives in its course are, pharyngeal, occipital, deep division of the temporo-maxillary, and middle thyroid. The Vertebral vein descends by the side of the vertebral artery in the canal formed by the foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, and terminates at the root of the neck in the sub- clavian vein close to its termination. In the lower part of the ver- tebral canal it frequently divides into two branches, one of which advances forwards, while the other passes through the foramen in the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, before opening into the subclavian vein. The Branches which it receives in its course are the posterior con- dyloid vein, muscular branches, cervical meningo-rachidian veins, and near its termination, the superficial and deep cervical veins. The Inferior thyroid veins, two, and frequently more in number, are situated one on each side of the trachea, and receive the venous blood from the thyroid gland. They communicate with each other, and with the middle and superior thyroid veins, and form a plexus on the front of the trachea. The right vein terminates in the right392 VEIXS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. vena innominata, just at its union with tlie superior cava; the left in the left vena innominata. VEINS OP THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The veins of the upper extremity are deep and superficial. The deep veins accompany the branches and trunks of the arteries, and constitute their xence comites. The vense comites of the radial and ulnar arteries are enclosed in the same sheath with those vessels, and terminate at the bend of the elbow in the brachial veins. The brachial venge comites are situated one on each side of the artery, and open into the axillary vein; the axillary becomes the subclavian, and the subclavian imites with the internal jugular to form the vena innominata. The Superficial veins of the forearm are the— Anterior ulnar vein. Cephalic vein, Posterior ulnar vein, ]\Iedian vein, Basilic vein, Median basilic, Eadial vein, Median cephalic. The Anterior ulnar vein collects the venous blood from the inner and palmar border of the hand and ascends along the anterior aspect of the inner side of the forearm to the bend of the elbow, where it receives the median basilic, and becomes the basilic vein. The Posterior ulnar vein commences on the dorsum of the hand in the ulnar termination of the venous arch which receives the digital veins from the fingers, and after being joined by a large vein, the vena salvatella, from the little finger, ascends along the posterior aspect of the forearm to the bend of the elbow, where it turns for- ward and terminates in the anterior ulnar vein. The Basilic vein {jSaaLXiKoc, royal, or principal) ascends from the common idnar vein formed by the two preceding, along the inner side of the upper arm, and near its middle pierces the fascia; it then passes upwards to the axilla, and becomes the axillary vein. The Radial vein commences on the dorsum of the hand, in the radial termination of the venous arcli^ which receives the veins of the fingers. This origin is increased by the junction of some small veins from the thumb. The radial vein ascends the dorsal side of the forearm to a little below its middle, then lies on its anterior aspect to the bend of the elbow, where it receives the median cephalic, and becomes the cephalic vein. The Cephalic vein {Kicpakr}, the head) ascends along the outer side of the arm to its upper third; it then enters the groove between the pectoralis major and deltoid muscle, where it is in relation with the descending branch of the thoracico-acromialis artery, and ter- minates beneath the clavicle in the axillary vein. A large commu- nicating branch sometimes crosses the clavicle between the external393 MEDIAN CEPHALIC AND BASILIC VEINS. jugular and this vein, wliich gives it the appearance of being derived directly from the head—hence its appellation. The Median vein is intermediate in position between the anterior ulnar and radial vein; it begins at the wrist by the junction of branches from- the palm of the hand, and col- lects the blood from the anterior aspect of the forearm, communicat- ing with the two preceding. At the bend of the elbow it receives a branch from the deep veins, and di- vides into two branches, the median cephalic and median basilic. The Median cephalic vein, longer and somewhat smaller than the me- dian basilic, passes obliquely out- wards, in the groove between the biceps and supinator longus, to unite with the radial and form the cephalic vein. The branches of the external cutaneous nerve pass behind it. The Median basilic vein, larger than the median cephalic, passes ob- liquely inwards, in the groove be- tween the biceps and pronator radii teres, and unites with the common trunk of the ulnar veins to form the basilic vein. This vein is crossed by one or two filaments of the internal j cutaneous nerve, and overlies the brachial artery from which it is se- parated by the aponeurotic slip given off from the tendon of the biceps. * Veins of the forearm and bend of the elbow, 1.

It lies to the inner side of the artery, receives numerous branches from the collateral veins of the branches of the axillary artery; and at the lower border of the first rib becomes the subclavian vein. Above the pectoralis minor it receives the cephalic vein. SUBCLAVIAN VEIN. The subclavian vein crosses over the first rib and beneath the clavicle, and xmites with the internal jugular vein to form the vena innominata. It lies at first in front of the subclavian artery, and then in front of the scalenus anticus, which separates it from that vessel. The phrenic and pneumogastric nerve pass between the artery and vein. The veins opening into the subclavian are the ex- ternal and anterior jugular externally to the scalenus anticus, and the vertebral internally to that muscle. VEINS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The veins of the lower extremity are deep and superficial. The deep veins accompany the branches of the arteries in pairs, and form the vense comites of the anterior and posterior tibial and peroneal artery. These veins unite in the popliteal region to form a single vessel of large size, the popliteal, which successively becomes in its course the femoral and the external iliac vein. POPLITEAL VEIN. The popliteal vein ascends through the popliteal region, lying, in the first instance directly upon the artery, and then getting somewhat to its outer side ; and passing through the oval opening in the tendon of the adductor magnus becomes the femoral vein. It receives several muscular and articular branches, and the external saphenous vein. The valves in this vein are four or five in number. FEMORAL VEIN. The femoral vein, commencing at the opening in the adductor magnus muscle, ascends the thigh in the sheath of the femoral artery, and entering the pelvis beneath Poupart's ligament, becomes the external iliac vein. In the lower part of its course it is situated on the outer side of the artery; it then becomes placed behind that vessel, and at Poupart's ligament, lies to its inner side. It receives the muscular veins and the profunda, and, through the saphenous opening, the internal saphenous vein. The valves in this vein are four or five in number.395 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA. The Profunda vein is formed by the convergence of the numerous small veins which accompany the branches of the artery : it is a vein of large size, lies in front of the profunda artery, and terminates in the femoral at about two inches below Poupart's ligament. The Superficial veins are the external or short, and the internal or long saphenous. They commence on the dorsum of the foot in a venous arch which lies across the metatarsus; this venous arch re- ceives the digital veins by its convex side. The External saphenous vein commences at the outer extremity of the venous arch and on the outer border of the foot. It passes behind the outer ankle, ascends along the posterior aspect of the leg, lying in the groove between the two bellies of the gastrocnemius muscle, and pierces the deep fascia in the popliteal region to join the popliteal vein. It receives several cutaneous branches in the popliteal region previously to perforating the deep fascia, and is in relation in its course with the external saphenous nerve. The Internal saphenous vein commences at the inner extremity of the venous arch of the dorsum and on the inner side of the foot and great toe. It ascends in front of the inner ankle, and along the inner side of the leg; it then passes behind the inner condyle of the femur and along the inner side of the thigh to the saphenous opening, where it pierces the sheath of the femoral vessels, and terminates in the femoral vein, at about one inch and a half below Poupart's ligament. It receives in its course the cutaneous veins of the leg and thigh, and communicates freely with the deep veins. At the saphenous opening it is joined by the superficial epigastric and circumflexa ilii vein, and by the external pudics. The situation of this vein in the thigh is not unfrequently occupied by two or even three trunks of nearly equal size. VEINS OF THE TRUNK. The veins of the trunk maybe divided into, 1. The superior vena cava, with its formative branches. 2. The inferior vena cava, with its formative branches. 3. The azygos veins. 4. The vertebral and spinal veins. 5. The cardiac veins. 6. The portal vein. 7. The pulmonary veins. SUPERIOR VENA CAVA, WITH ITS FORMATIVE BRANCHES. The VencB innominatce are two large trunks, formed by the union of the internal jugular and subclavian vein at each side of the root of the neck. The Right vena innominata, about an inch and a quarter in length, lies superficially and externally to the arteria innominata, and descends almost vertically to unite with its fellow of the opposite sideVEINS OF THE TRUNK. 396 Fig. 153.* in the formation of tlie supe- rior cava. At the junction of the jugular and subclavian vein it receives from behind the ductus lymphaticus dex- ter, and lower down it has opening into it the riglit in- ternal mammary, and right inferior thyroid vein. The Left vena innomin- ata, considerably longer than the right, extends almost horizontally across the roots of the three great arteries arising from the arch of the aorta, to the right side of the mediastinum, where it unites with the right vena innominata, to constitute the superior vena cava. It is in relation in front with the left sterno-clavi- cular articulation and the first piece of the sternum. At its commencement it receives the thoracic duct which opens into it from behind, and in its course is joined by the left inferior thyroid, left mam- mary, and left superior in- tercostal vein. It also re- ceives some small veins from the mediastinum and thymus gland* There are no valves in the vense innominate. * Veins of the trunk and neck. 1. Superior vena cava. 2.

The superior cava {descendens) is a short trunk ahout three inches in length, formed by the junction of the two vense innominatse. It descends perpendicularly on the right side of the arch of the aorta and entering the pericardium terminates in the upper part of the right auricle. It is in relation in front with the pericardium; hehind with the right pulmonary artery; internally with the ascending aorta; ex- ternally with the pleura and right phrenic nerve. Immediately before entering the pericardium it receives the vena azygos major. INFERIOR VENA CAVA, WITH ITS FORMATIVE BRANCHES. The External iliac vein lies to the inner side of the corresponding artery at the os pubis ; but gradually gets behind it as it passes upwards along the brim of the pelvis; it terminates opposite the sacro-iljiac symphysis by uniting with the internal iliac, to form the common iliac vein. Immediately above Poupart's ligament it re- ceives the epigastric and circumflexa ilii vein; it has no valves. The Internal iliac vein is formed by vessels which correspond with the branches of the internal iliac artery; it receives the returning blood from the gluteal, ischiatic, internal pudic, and obturator vein, externally to the pelvis; and from the vesical and uterine plexuses within the pelvis. The vein lies to the inner side of the internal ilj^c artery, and terminates by uniting with the external iliac vein, to form the common iliac. The Vesical and 2orostatic plexus is an important plexus of veins which surrounds the neck and base of the bladder and prostate gland, and receives its blood from the great dorsal vein of the penis and the veins of the external organs of generation. It is retained in connexion with the sides of the bladder by a reflection of the pelvic fascia. The Uterine plexus is situated around the vagina, and upon the sides of the uterus, between the two layers of the broad ligaments. The veins forming the vesical and uterine plexus are peculiarly sub- ject to the production of phlebolites. The Common iliac veins are formed by the union of the external and internal iliac vein on each side of the pelvis. The right common iliac, shorter than the left, ascends obliquely behind the correspond- ing artery; and upon the intervertebral substance of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebra, unites with the vein of the opposite side, to form the inferior cava. The left common iliac, longer and more oblique than the right, ascends behind and a little internally to the corresponding artery, and passes beneath the right common iliac artery, near its origin, to unite with the right vein in the formationINFERIOR VENA CAVA. 398 of the inferior vena cava. The right common iliac vein has no branch ; the left receives the vena sacra media. These veins have no valves. INFERIOR VENA CAVA. The inferior vena cava is formed by the union of the two common iliac veins, upon the intervertebral substance of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebra. It ascends along the front of the vertebral column, on the right of the abdominal aorta, and passing through the fissure in the posterior border of the liver and the quadrilateral opening in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm, terminates in the inferior and posterior part of the right auricle. There are no valves in this vein. It is in relation from below upwards, in front with the mesentery, transverse duodenum, portal vein, pancreas, and liver, which latter nearly and sometimes completely surrounds it; behind it rests on the vertebral column and right crus of the diaphragm, from which it is separated by the right renal artery and right lumbar arteries; to the right it has the peritoneum and sympathetic nerve; to the left the aorta. The Branches which the inferior vena cava receives in its course, are the— Lumbar, Supra-renal, Eight spermatic, Phrenic, Eenal, Hepatic. The Lumbar veins, three or four in number on each side, collect the venous blood from the muscles and integument of the loins, and spinal veins: the left are longer than the right on account of the position of the vena cava. The Right spermatic vein is formed by the two veins which return tlie blood from the venous plexus of the spermatic cord. These veins follow the course of the spermatic artery, and unite to form iJie single trunk which opens into the inferior vena cava. The left spermatic vein terminates in the left renal vein. The Ovarian veins represent the spermatic veins of the male, and collect the venous blood from the ovaries, round ligaments. Fallo- pian tubes, and communicate with the uterine sinuses. They ter- minate as in the male. The Renal or emulgent veins return the blood from the kidneys; their branches are situated in front of the divisions of the renal arte- ries, and the left opens into the vena cava somewhat higher than the right. The left is longer than the right in consequence of the posi- tion of the vena cava, and crosses the aorta immediately below the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. It receives the left sper- matic vein, which terminates in it at right angles : hence the more frequent occurrence of varicocele on the left than on the right side.AZYGOS VEINS. 399 The Supra-renal veins terminate partly in the renal veins, and partly in the inferior vena cava. The Phrenic veins return the blood from the ramifications of the phrenic arteries; they open into the inferior vena cava. The Hepatic veins form two principal trunks and numerous smaller veins which open into the inferior vena cava, while that vessel is situated in the posterior border of the liver. The hepatic veins commence in the liver by minute venules, the intralobular veins, in the centre of each lobule ; these pour their blood into larger vessels, the suhlohular veins ; and the sublobular veins con- stitute, by their convergence and union, the hepatic trunks, which terminate in the inferior vena cava. AZYGOS VEINS. The azygos veins (fig. 153) form a system of communication between the superior and inferior vena cava, and serve to return the blood from that part of the trunk of the body in which those vessels are deficient, on account of their connexion with the heart. This system consists ;of three vessels—namely, Vena azygos major. Vena azygos minor, Superior intercostal veins. The vena azygos major commences in the lumbar region by a communication with the lumbar veins ; sometimes it is joined by a branch directly from the inferior vena cava, or by one from the renal vein. It passes through the right crus of the diaphragm, or through the aortic opening, and ascends along the right side of the vertebral column to the third dorsal vertebra, where it arches for- ward over the right bronchus, and terminates in the superior vena cava. It receives all the intercostal veins of the right side with the exception of those of the first and second spaces, the vena azygos minor, and the right bronchial vein. The vena azygos minor commences in the lumbar region, on the left side, by a communication with one of the lumbar veins or with the renal vein. It enters the chest through the left crus of the diaphragm and ascends the left side of the vertebral column, crosses the fifth or sixth dorsal vertebra and opens into the vena azygos major. It receives the six or seven lower intercostal veins of the left side. The azygos veins have no valves. The right superior intercostal vein receives the veins of the first and second intercostal spaces, and opens into the subclavian vein of the same side. The left superior intercostal vein is the trunk formed by the union of the five or six upper intercostal veins of the left side. It communicates below with the vena azygos minor, and crosses the400 CARDIAC VEINS, arch of the aorta to terminate in the left vena innominata. It receives the left bronchial vein. VERTEBRAL AND SPINAL VEINS. The numerous venous plexuses of the vertebral column and spinal cord may be arranged into three groups:—■ Dorsi-spinal, Meningo-rachidian, Medulli-spinal. The Dorsi-spinal veins form a plexus around the spinous, trans- verse, and articular processes, and arches of the vertebras. They receive the returning blood from the dorsal muscles and surrounding structures, and transmit it, in part to the meningo-rachidian, and in part to the vertebral, intercostal, lumbar, and sacral veins. The Meningo-rachidian veins are situated between the theca vertebralis and the vertebrae. They communicate freely with each other by means of a complicated plexus. In front they form two longitudinal trunks, {longitudinal spinal sinuses) extending the whole length of the column on each side of the posterior common liga- ment, and are joined on the body of each vertebra by transverse trunks, which pass beneath the ligament, and receive the large basi- vertebral veins from the interior of each vertebra. The meningo- rachidian veins communicate superiorly through the anterior condy- loid foramina with the internal jugulars; in the neck they pour their blood into the vertebral veins ; in the thorax, into the inter- costals; and in the loins and pelvis into the lumbar and sacral veins, the communications being made through the intervertebral fora- mina. The Medulli-spinal veins are situated between the pia mater and arachnoid; they communicate freely with each other to form plexuses, and send branches through the intervertebral foramina with each of the spinal nerves, to join the veins of the trunk. CARDIAC VEINS. The veins (cardiacse vel coronarise cordis) returning the blood from the substance of the heart, are the— Great cardiac vein. Anterior cardiac veins, Posterior cardiac vein, Venae Thebesii. The Great cardiac vein (vena cordis magna ; coronaria magna) commences at the apex of the heart, and ascends along the anterior ventricular groove to the base of the ventricles; it then curves around the left auriculo-ventricular groove to the posterior part of401 POETAL SYSTEM. the heart, where it terminates in the right auricle. It receives in its course the left cardiac veins from the left auricle and ventricle, and the posterior cardiac veins from the posterior ventricular groove. The Posterior cardiac vein (vena cordis media), frequently two in number, commences also at the apex of the heart, and ascends along the posterior ventricular groove, to terminate in the great cardiac vein. It receives the veins at right angles from the pos- terior aspect of the two ventricles. The Anterior cardiac veins (vense parvse), collect the blood from the anterior surface of the right ventricle; one larger than the rest runs along the right border of the heart and joins the trunk formed by these veins, which curves around the right auriculo-ventricular groove, to terminate in the great cardiac vein near its entrance into the right auricle ; others cross the groove, and open directly into the auricle. The VencB Thehesii (venae minimse) are numerous minute venules which convey the venous blood directly from the substance of the heart into the right auricle. The cardiac veins have no valves, excepting that at the orifice of the great vein. • i PORTAL SYSTEM. The portal system is composed of four large veins which return the blood from the chylopoietic viscera ; they are the Inferior mesenteric vein. Splenic vein, Superior mesenteric vein, Gastric veins. The Inferior mesenteric vein receives its blood from the rectum by means of the hsemorrhoidal veins, and from the sigmoid flexure and descending colon, and ascends behind the transverse duodenum and pancreas, to terminate in the splenic vein. Its hsemorrhoidal branches inosculate with branches of the internal iliac vein, and thus establish a communication between the portal and general venous system. The Superior mesenteric vein is formed by branches which collect the venous blood from the capillaries of the superior mesenteric artery; they constitute by their junction a large trunk, which as- cends by the side of the corresponding artery, crosses the transverse portion of the duodenum, and unites behind the pancreas with the splenic in the formation of the portal vein. The Splenic vein commences in the structure of the spleen, and quits that organ by several large branches; it is larger than the splenic artery, and perfectly straight in its course. It passes hori- zontally inwards behind the pancreas, and terminates near its greater end by uniting with the superior mesenteric and forming the portal vein. It receives in its course the gastric and pancreatic veins, and near its termination the inferior mesenteric vein.THE PORTAL VEIN. 402 The Gastric veins correspond with the gastric, gastro-epiploic, and vasa breyia arteries, and terminate in the splenic vein. The Vena port^, formed by the union of the splenic and superior mesenteric vein behind the pancreas, ascends through the right border of the lesser omentum to the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into two branches, one for each lateral lobe. In the right border of the lesser omentum it is situated behind and between the hepatic artery and ductus communis choledochus, and * The portal vein. 1.

At the transverse fissure each primary branch divides into numerous secondary branches which ramify through the portal canals, and give off vaginal and interlobular veins, and the latter terminate in the lobular venous plexus of the lobules of the liver. The portal vein within the liver receives the venous blood from the capillaries of the hepatic artery. PULMONARY VEINS. The pulmonary veins (vense pulmonales), four in number, return the arterial blood from the lungs to the left auricle of the heart; they differ from veins in general, in the area of their cylinders being but little larger than that of the corresponding arteries, and in ac- companying singly each branch of the pulmonary artery. They commence in the capillaries upon the parietes of the intercellular passages and air-cells, and unite to form a single trunk for each lobe. The vein of the middle lobe of the right lung unites with the supe- rior vein, so as to form the two trunks which open into the left auricle. Sometimes they remain separate, and then there are three pulmons^ry veins on the right side. The right pulmonary veins pass behind the right auricle to the left auricle; the left pass in front of the descending aorta; they both pierce the pericardium. Within the lung the branches of the pulmonary veins are behind the bron- chial tubes, and those of the pulmonary artery in front; but at the root of the lungs the veins are in front, next the arteries, and then the bronchi. There are no valves in the pulmonary veins. D D 2404 CHAPTEE YII. OF THE LYMPHATICS. The lymphatic vessels, or absorbents, have received their double appellation, from certain phenomena which they present; the former name being derived from the appearance of the limpid fluid (lympha, water) which they convey ; and the latter from their supposed pro- perty of absorbing foreign substances into the system. They are minute, delicate, and transparent vessels, remarkable for their general uniformity of size, for a knotted appearance which is due ta the presence of numerous valves, for the frequent dichotomous divi- sions which occur in their course, and for their division into several branches immediately before entering a gland. Their office is to collect the products of digestion and the detrita of nutrition, and convey them into the venous circulation near the heart. Lymphatic vessels commence in a delicate network which is dis- tributed on the cutaneous surface of the body, on the various sur- faces of organs and throughout their internal structure; and from this network the lymphatic vessels proceed, nearly in straight lines, in a direction towards the root of the neck. In their course they are intercepted by numerous small, spheroid or oblong or flattened bodies, lymphatic glands. The lymphatic vessels entering these glands are termed vasa inferentia or afferentia, and those which quit them, vasa efferentia. The vasa inferentia vary in number from two to six, they divide at the distance of a few lines from the gland into several smaller vessels, and enter it by one of its flattened surfaces.* The vasa efferentia escap^ from the gland on the opposite, but not unfrequently on the same surface; they con- sist, like the vasa inferentia at their junction with the gland, of several small vessels which unite after a course of a few lines to form from one to three trunks, often twice as large as the vasa inferentia. Lymphatic vessels admit of a threefold division, into superficial, deep, and lacteals. The superficial lymjjhatic vessels, on the sur- face of the body, follow the course of the veins, and pierce the deep fascia in convenient situations, to join the deep lymphatics. On the surface of organs they converge to the nearest lymphatic trunks. * See Mr. Lane's article on the " Lymphatic System," in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology.405 GENERAL ANATOMY OF LYMPHATICS. The superficial ly mphatic glands are placed in the most protected situations of the superficial fascia, as in the hollow of the ham and groin in the lower extremity, and on . the inner side of the arm in the upper extremity. The deep lymphatics, fewer in number and somewhat larger than the superficial vessels, accompany the deeper veins ; those from the lower parts of the body converging to the numerous glands seated around the iliac veins and inferior vena cava, and terminating in a large trunk situated on the vertebral column, the thoracic duct. From the upper part of the trunk of the body on the left side, and from the left side of the head and neck, they also proceed to the thoracic duct. Those on the right side of the head and neck, right upper extremity, and right side of the thorax, form a distinct duct which terminates at the point of junction of the subclavian with the internal jugular vein on the right side of the root of the neck. The lacteals are the lymphatic vessels of the small intestines; they have received their distinctive appellation from conveying the milk-like product of digestion, the chyle, to the great centre of the lymphatic system, the thoracic duct. They are situated in the mesentery, and pass through the numerous mesenteric glands in their course. Lymphatic vessels are very generally distributed through the animal tissues; there are, nevertheless, certain structures in which they have not been detected ; for example, the brain and spinal cord, the eye, bones, cartilages, tendons, the membranes of the ovum, the umbilical cord, and the placenta. The anastomoses between these vessels are less frequent than between arteries and veins ; they are effected by means of vessels of equal size with the vessels which they connect, and no increase of calibre results from their junction. The lymphatic vessels are smallest in the neck, larger in the upper extremities, and larger still in the lower limbs. For the purpose of effecting the movement of their fluids in a proper direction, lymphatic vessels are furnished with valves, and it is to these that the appearance of constrictions around the cylinders of the vessels, at short distances, is due. Like the valves of veins, the valves of lymphatic vessels are each composed of two semilunar flaps attached by their convex border to the sides of the vessel and free by their concave border. This is the general character of the valves, but, as in veins, there are exceptions in their form and dis- position; sometimes one flap is so small as to be merely rudi- mentary, while the other is large in proportion; sometimes the flap runs all the way round the tube, leaving a central aperture which can only be closed by a contractile power in the valve itself; and sometimes instead of being circular the aperture is elliptical, and the arrangement of the flaps like that of the ileo-csecal valve. * These peculiarities are most frequently met with at and near the * Mr. Lane, loc. cit.GENERAL ANATOMY OF LYMPHATICS. 406 anastomoses of the lymphatic vessels. The valves occur most nu- merously near the lymphatic glands ; next in frequency they are found in the neck and upper extremities where the vessels are small, and least numerously in the lower limbs where the lymphatics are large. In the thoracic duct an interspace of two or three inches frequently occurs between the valves. Connected with the presence of valves in the lymphatic vessels, are two lateral dilatations or pouches, analogous to the valvxdar sinuses of veins. These sinuses are situated on the cardiac side of the valves ; they receive the valves when the latter are thrown back by the current of the lymph; and when reflux occurs, they become distended with a body of fluid which makes pressure on the flaps. These pouch-like dilatations and the constrictions corresponding with the line of attachment of the convex borders of the flaps are the cause of the knotted appear- ance of distended lymphatic vessels. Like arteries and veins, lymphatic vessels are composed of three coats, external, middle, and internal. The external coat is cellulo- fibrous, like that of bloodvessels; it is thin, but very strong, and serves to connect the vessel to surrounding tissues, at the same time that it forms a protective covering. The middle coat is thin and elastic, and consists of a layer of longitudinal fibres analogous to those of the innermost layer of the middle coat of arteries and veins. Some few circular fibres may be seen externally to these in the larger lymphatic vessels. The internal coat is inelastic arid more liable to rupture than the other coats. It is a serous layer continuous with the lining membrane of the veins, and invested by epithelium. The valves are composed of a very thin layer of fibrous tissue coated on its two surfaces by epithelium. The lymphatic glands (conglobate, absorbent) are smaU oval and somewhat flattened or rounded bodies, composed of a plexus of minute lymphatic vessels, associated with a plexus of bloodvessels, and enclosed in a thin capsule of cellular tissue. When examined on the surface they are seen to have a lobulated appearance, while the face of a section is cellular from the division of the numberless convolutions which are formed by the lymphatic vessels within its substance. The colour of the glands is a pale pink, excepting those of the lungs, the bronchial glands, which in the adult are more or less mottled with black, and are sometimes filled with a black pigment. Lymphatic glands are larger in the young subject than in the adult, and are smallest in old age ; they, as weU as their vessels, are supplied with arteries, veins and nerves, like other structures. I shall describe the lymphatic vessels and glands according to the arrangement adopted for the veins, commencing with those of the head and neck, and proceeding next to those of the upper extremity, lower extremity, and trunk.407 LYMPHATICS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. GrLANDS.—The Superficial lymphatic glands of the head and face are small, few in number, and isolated ; they are, the occipital, which are situated near the origin of the occipito-frontalis muscle ; posterior auricular, behind the ear; parotid, in the parotid gland; zygomatic, in the zygomatic fossa ; buccal, upon the buccinator muscle ; and suh-maxillary, beneath the margin of the lower jaw. There are no deep lymphatic glands within the cranium. The Superficial cervical lymphatic glands are few in number and small; they are situated in the course of the external jugular vein, between the sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscle, at the root of the neck, and about the larynx. The Deep cervical glands (glandulse concatenatse) are numerous and of large size; they are situated around the internal jugular vein and sheath of the carotid artery, by the side of the pharynx, oesophagus, and trachea, and extend from the base of the skull to the root of the neck, where they are in communication with the lymphatic vessels and glands of the thorax. Vessels.—The Superficial lymphatic vessels of the head and face are disposed in three groups ; occipital, which take the course of the occipital vein to the occipital and deep cervical glands ; tem- poral, which follow the branches of the temporal vein to the parotid and deep cervical glands ; and facial, which accompany the facial vein to the submaxillary lymphatic glands. * The Deep lymphatic vessels of the head are the meningeal and cerebral; the former are situated in connexion with the meningeal veins, and escape through foramina at the base of the skull, to join the deep cervical glands. The cerebral lymphatics, according to Fohmann, are situated on the surface of the pia mater, none having as yet been discovered in the substance of the brain. They pass most probably through the foramina at the base of the skull, to terminate in the deep cervical glands. The Deep lymphatic vessels of the face proceed from the nasal fossEB, mouth, and pharynx, and terminate in the submaxillary and deep cervical glands. The Superficial and deep cervical lymphatic vessels accompany the jugular veins, passing from gland to gland ; at the root of the neck they communicate with the thoracic lymphatic vessels, and ter- minate, on the right side, in the ductus lymphaticus dexter ; on the left, in the thoracic duct, near its termination. LYMPHATICS OP THE UPPER EXTREMITY. GrLANDS.—The Superficial lymphatic glands of the arm are not more than four or five in number, and of very small size. One or two axe situated near the median basilic and median cephalic vein,LYMPHATICS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 408 at the bend of the elbow; and one or two near the basilic vein, on the inner side of the upper arm, immediately above the elbow. The Deep glands in the forearm are excessively small and infrequent; two or three may be found in the course of the radial and ulnar vessels. In the upper arm there is a chain of small glands, accompanying the brachial artery. The Axillary glands are numerous and of large size. Some are closely adherent to the vessels, others are dispersed in the loose cellular tissue of the axilla, and a small chain may be observed ex- tending along the lower border of the pectoralis major to the mam- mary gland. Two or three subclavian glands are situated beneath the clavicle, and serve as the medium of communication between the axillary and deep cervical lymphatic glands. Vessels.—The Superficial lymphatic vessels of the upper ex- tremity commence upon the fingers and take their course along the forearm to the bend of the elbow. The greater part reach their destination by passing along the dorsal surface of the fingers, wrist, and forearm, and then curving around the borders of the latter; but some few are met with in the palm of the hand, which take the direction of the median vein. At the bend of the elbow the lym- phatics arrange themselves into two groups; an internal and larger group, which communicates with a gland situated just above the inner condyle, and then accompanies the basilic vein upwards to the axilla to enter the axillary glands; and a smaller group which fol- lows the course of the cephalic vein. Several of the vessels of this group cross the biceps muscle at its upper part to reach the axillary glands, while the remainder, two or three in number, ascend with^ the cephalic vein in the interspace of the deltoid and pectoralis major; these latter usually join a small gland in this space, and then cross the pectoralis minor muscle to become continuous with the subclavian lymphatics. Besides the lymphatic vessels of the arm, the axillary glands re- ceive those from the integument of the chest, its anterior, posterior, and lateral aspect, and the lymphatics of the mammary gland. The Deep lymphatics accompany the vessels of the upper ex- tremity, and communicate occasionally with the superficial lym- phatics. They enter the axillary and subclavian glands, and, at the root of the neck, terminate on the left side in the thoracic duct, and on the right side in the ductus lymphaticus dexter. LYMPHATICS OP THE LOWER EXTREMITY. GrLANDS.—The Superficial lymphatic glands of the lower ex- tremity are those of the groin, the inguinal; and one or two situ- ated in the superficial fascia of the posterior aspect of the thigh, just above the popliteal region. The iTiguinal glands are divisible into two groups; a superior409 LYMPHATICS OP THE LOWEK EXTREMITY. group of small size, situated along tlie line of Poupart's ligament, and receiving the lymphatic vessels from the parietes of the abdo- men, gluteal region, perineum, and genital organs; and an inferior group of larger glands clustered around the internal saphenous vein near its termination, and receiving the superficial lymphatic vessels from the lower extremity. The deep lymphatic glands are the anterior tibial, popliteal, deep inguinal, gluteal, and ischiatic. The Anterior tibial is generally a single gland, placed on the interosseous membrane, by the side of the anterior tibial artery in the upper part of its course. The Popliteal glands, four or five in number, and small, are embedded in the loose cellular tissue and fat of the popliteal space. The Deep inguinal glands, less numerous and smaller than the superficial, are situated near the femoral vessels in the groin, be- neath the fascia lata. The Gluteal and ischiatic glands are placed near the vessels of that name, above and below the pyriformis muscle at the great ischiatic foramen. Vessp*ls.—The Superficial lymphatic vessels are divisible into two groups, internal and external; the internal and principal group, commencing on- the dorsum and inner side of the foot, ascend the leg by the side of the internal saphenous vein, and passing behind the inner condyle of the femur follow the direction of that vein to the groin, where they join the saphenous group of superficial inguinal glands. The greater part of the efferent vessels from these glands pierce the cribriform fascia of the saphenous opening and the sheath of the femoral vessels, to join the lymphatic gland situated in the femoral ring, which serves to establish a communication between the lymphatics of the lower extremity and those of the trunk. The other efferent vessels pierce the fascia lata to join the deep glands. The vessels which pass upwards from the outer side of the dorsum of the foot ascend along the outer side of the leg, and curve inwards across the front of the leg just below the knee, to unite with the lymphatics of the inner side of the thigh. The external group con- sists of a few lymphatic vessels which commence on the outer side of the foot and posterior part of the ankle, and accompany the ex- ternal saphenous vein to the popliteal region, where they enter the popliteal glands. The Deep lymphatic vessels accompany the deep veins, and com- municate with the various glands in their course. After joining the deep inguinal glands they pass beneath Poupart's ligament, to communicate with the numerous glands situated around the iliac vessels. The deep lymphatics of the gluteal region follow the course of the branches of the gluteal and ischiatic veins. The former join the glands situated on the upper border of the pyriformis muscle, and the latter, after communicating with the lymphatics of the thigh, enter the ischiatic glands.410 LYMPHATICS or THE TRUNK. The lymphatics of the trunk may be arranged under three heads, superficial, deep, and visceral. The Superficial lymphatic vessels of the upper half of the trunk pass upwards and outwards on each side, and converge, some to the axillary glands, and others to the glands at the root of the neck. The lymphatics from the mammary glands follow the lower border of the pectoralis major, communicating, by means of a chain of lym- phatic glands, with the axillary glands. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the lower half of the trunk, gluteal region, perineum, and external organs of generation, converge to the superior group of superficial inguinal glands. One or two small glands are situated on each side of the dorsal vein of the penis, near the suspensory liga- ment ; from these, as from the superficial lymphatics, the efferent vessels pass into the superior group of superficial inguinal glands. Glands.—The Deep lymphatic glands of the thorax are the intercostal, anterior mediastinal, and oesophageal. The Intercostal glands, of small si2;e, are situated on each side of the vertebral column, near the articidations of the heads of the ribs, and in the course of the intercostal arteries. The Antenor mediastinal glands are situated along the course of the internal mammaiy arteries; they are six or seven in number on each side, and receive the lymphatic vessels from the anterior wall of the chest, the mediastinum, thymus gland, and pericardium. The (Esophageal glands, fifteen or twenty in number, are situated in the course of the oesophagus, and receive the lymphatics of that tube; they communicate above with the deep cervical glands, on each side with the intercostal, and below "with the abdominal glands. Vessels.—The Deep lymphatic vessels of the thorax are the intercostal, internal mammary, and diaphragmatic. The Intercostal lymphatic vessels follow the course of the veins of the same name; and reaching the vertebral column, curve down- wards, to terminate in the thoracic duct. The Internal mammary lymphatics commence in the parietes of the abdomen, commtinicating with the epigastric lymphatics. They ascend by the side of the internal mammary vessels, being joined in their course by the anterior intercostals, and terminate at the root of the neck, on the right side in the tributaries of the ductus lym- phaticus dexter; on the left, in the thoracic duct. The diaphragmatic lymphatics pursue the direction of their corresponding veins, and terminate some in front, in the internal mammary vessels, and some behind, in the posterior mediastinal lymphatics. Glands.—The Deep lymphatic glands of the abdomen are the lumbar glands; they are numerous, and seated around the common iliac vessels, the aorta, and vena cava.LYMPHATICS OF THE VISCERA. 411 The deep lymphatic glands of the pelvis are the external iliac, internal iliac, and sacral. The External iliac are placed around the external iliac vessels, being in continuation by one extremity with the femoral lymphatics; by the other, with the lumbar glands. The Internal iliac glands are situated in the course of the in- ternal iliac vessels, and the sacral glands rest on the concave sur- face of the sacrum. Vessels.—The Beep lymphatic vessels are continued upwards from the thigh beneath Poupart's ligament, and along the external iliac vessels to the lumbar glands, receiving in their course the epi- gastric, circumflexa ilii, and ilio-lumbar lymphatic vessels. Those from the parietes of the pelvis, and from the gluteal, ischiatic, and obturator vessels, follow the course of the internal iliac veins, and unite with the lumbar lymphatics. And the lumbar lymphatic vessels, after receiving all the lymphatics from the lower extremities, pelvis, and loins, terminate by several large trunks in the recepta- culum chyli. j LYMPHATICS OP THE VISCERA. Lungs.—The Lymphatic vessels of the lungs, of large size, are distributed over every part of the surface, and through the texture of those organs: they converge to the bronchial glands, ten or twelve in number, situated around the bifurcation of the trachea and roots of the lungs. Some of these glands, of small size, may be traced in connexion with the bronchial tubes into the substance of the lungs. The efferent vessels from the bronchial glands unite with the tracheal and oesophageal glands, and terminate principally in the thoracic duct at the root of the neck, and partly in the ductus lymphaticus dexter. The bronchial glands, in the adult, present a variable tint of brown, and in old age a deep black colour. In in- fancy they have none of this pigment, and are not to be distinguished from lymphatic glands in other situations. Heart.—The Lymphatic vessels of the heart originate in the subserous cellular tissue of the surface, and in the deeper tissues of that organ, and follow the course of the vessels, principally, along the right border of the heart to the glands situated around the arch of the aorta and to the bronchial glands, whence they proceed to the root of the neck, and terminate in the thoracic duct. The cardiac glands are three or four in number. The Pericardiac and thymic lymphatic vessels proceed to join the anterior mediastinal and bronchial glands. Liver.—The Lymphatic vessels of the liver are divisible into the deep and superficial. The former take their course through the portal canals, and through the right border of the lesser omentum, to the lymphatic glands situated in the course of the hepatic artery and along the lesser curve of the stomach. The superficial lym-LYMPHATICS OF THE VISCERA. 412 phatics are situated in the cellular structure of the proper capsule, over the whole surface of the liver. Those of the convex surface are divided into two sets :—1. Those which pass from before back- wards; 2. Those which advance from behind forwards. The former unite to form trunks, which enter between the folds of the lateral ligaments at the right and left extremities of the organ, and of the coronary ligament in the middle. Some of these pierce the dia- phragm and join the posterior mediastinal glands; others converge to the lymphatic glands situated around the inferior cava. Those which pass from behind forwards consist of two groups : one ascends between the folds of the broad ligament, and perforates the diaphragm, to terminate in the anterior mediastinal glands; the other curves around the anterior margin of the liver to its concave surface, and from thence to the glands in the right border of the lesser omentum. The lymphatic vessels of the concave surface are variously dis- tributed, according to their position; those from the right lobe terminate in the lumbar glands ; those from the gall-bladder, which are large, and form a remarkable plexus, enter the glands in the right border of the lesser omentum; and those from the left lobe converge to the lymphatic glands situated along the lesser curve of the stomach. Spleen and Pancreas.—The Lymphatic glands of the spleen are situated around its hilum, and those of pancreas in the course of the splenic vein. The lymphatic vessels of these organs pass through their respective glands, and join the aortic glands, previously to ter- minating in the thoracic duct. Stomach.—The Lymphatic glands of the stomach, of small size, are situated along the lesser and greater curves of that organ. The lymphatic vessels, as in other viscera, are superficial and deep, the former originating in the subserous, the latter in the submucous tissue; they pass from the stomach in four different directions: some ascend to the glands situated along the lesser curve; others descend to those occupying the greater curve ; a third set pass out- wards to the splenic glands, and a fourth to the glands situated near the pylorus and to the aortic glands. Intestines.—The Lymphatic glands of the small intestine are situated between the layers of the mesentery, in the meshes formed by the superior mesenteric artery, and are thence named mesenteric glands. These glands are most numerous and largest, superiorly, near the duodenum; and, inferiorly, near the termination of the ileum. The Lymphatic vessels of the small intestines are of two kinds: those of the structure of the intestines, which run upon its surface previously to entering the mesenteric glands; and those which com- mence in the villi, in the substance of the mucous membrane, and are named lacteals. The Lacteals, according to Henle, commence in the centre of each villus as a csecal tubulus, which opens into a fine network, situatedTHORACIC DUCT. 413 in the sub-mucous tissue. From this areolar network the lacteal vessels proceed to the mesenteric glands, and from thence to the thoracic duct, in which they terminate. The Lymphatic glands of the large intestines are situated along the attached margin of the intestine, in the meshes formed by the colic and hgemorrhoidal arteries previously to their distribution. The lymphatic vessels take their course in two different directions; those of the csecum, ascending colon and transverse colon, after tra- versing their proper glands, proceed to the mesenteric, and those of the descending colon and rectum to the lumbar glands. Kidney.—The Lymphatic vessels of the kidney follow the direction of the bloodvessels to the lumbar glands situated around the aorta and inferior vena cava; those of the supra-renal capsules, which are very large and numerous, terminate in the renal lymphatics. Pelvis.—The Lymphatic vessels of the viscera of the pelvis terminate in the sacral and lumbar glands. The Lymphatic vessels of the testicle take the course of the sper- matic cord, in which they are of large size ; they terminate in the lumbar glands. i THORACIC DUCT. The thoracic duct,* the great trunk of the lymphatic and chylous system, commences in the abdomen, by a considerable and somewhat triangular dilatation, the receptaculum chyli, which is situated on the front of the body of the second lumbar vertebra, behind and between the aorta and inferior vena cava, and close to the tendon of the right crus of the diaphragm. From the upper part of the re- ceptaculum chyli the thoracic duct ascends through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, and along the front of the vertebral column, lying between the thoracic aorta and vena azygos and upon the right intercostal arteries, to the fourth dorsal vertebra. It then inclines to the left side, passes behind the arch of the aorta, and ascends by the side of the oesophagus and behind the perpendicular portion of the left subclavian artery to the root of the neck opposite the seventh cervical vertebra, where it makes a sudden curve for- wards and downwards, and terminates at the point of junction of the left subclavian with the left internal jugular vein. The thoracic duct is about eighteen or twenty inches in length, and near its origin as large as a goosequill; as it ascends it di- minishes in size, and near its termination again becomes dilated. At the middle of the thorax it frequently divides into two branches of equal size, which re-unite after a short course ; and sometimes it gives off several branches, which assume a plexiform arrangement * The thoracic duct was discovered by Eustachius, in 1563, in the horse; he regarded it as a vein, and called it the yena alba thoracis. The lacteals were tirst seen by AseUius, in 1622, in the dog; and A^ithin the next ten years by Veshngius in man.414 THORACIC DUCT. Fi;]. 155* in this situation. Occa- sionally the thoracic duct bifurcates at the upper part of the thorax into two branches, one of which opens into the point of junction between the right subclavian and jugular vein, whUe the other pro- ceeds to the normal ter- mination of the duct on the left side. In rare in- stances the duct has been found to terminate in the vena azygos, which is its normal destination m some Mammalia. The thoracic duct pre- sents fewer valves in its course than lymphatic ves- sels generally ; at its ter- mination it is provided with a pair of semilunar valves, which prevent the admission of venous blood into its cylinder.

Within the thorax it is joined by a large lymphatic trunk from the liver, and in its course through the posterior mediastinum, receives the lymphatic vessels both from the viscera and parietes of the thorax. At its curve forwards in the neck it is joined by lymphatic trunks from the left side of the head and neck, left upper extremity, upper part of the thorax, and thoracic viscera. The Ductus lymphaticus dexter is a short trunk which receives the lymphatic vessels from the right side of the head and neck, right upper extremity, right side of the thorax, right lung, and one or two branches from the liver. It terminates at the junction of the right subclavian with the right internal jugular vein, at the point where these veins unite to form the right vena innominata ; and is provided at its termination with a pair of semilunar valves, which prevent the entrance of blood from the veins.416 CHAPTEE VIII. OF THE NEEVOUS SYSTEM. The nervous system consists of a central organ, tlie cerebro- spinal centre or axis, and numerous rounded and flattened wMte cords, the nerves, wliich are connected by one extremity with the cerebro-spinal centre, and by the other are distributed to all the textures of the body. The sympathetic system is an exception to this description ; for in place of one it has many small centres which are called ganglia, and which communicate very freely with the cerebro-spinal axis and with its nerves. The cerebro-spinal axis consists of two portions, the brain, an organ of large size, situated within the skull, and the spinal cord, a lengthened portion of the nervous Centre continuous with the brain, and occupying the canal of the vertebral column. The most superficial examination of the brain and spinal cord shows them to be composed of fibres, or rather fasciculi, which in some situations are ranged in a longitudinal direction, and in others are interlaced at various angles by cross fibres. The fasciculi are connected and held together by a delicate cellular web, which forms the bond of support of the entire organ. It is also observed that the cerebro-spinal axis presents two substances differing from each other in density and colour: a grey or cineritious or cortical sub- stance, and a white or medullary substance. The grey substance forms a thin lamella over the surface of the convolutions of the cere- brum, and of the laminae of the cerebellum : hence it has been named cortical; but the grey substance is not confined to the surface of the brain, as this term would imply; it is likewise situated in the centre of the spinal cord its entire length, and may be thence traced through the medulla oblongata, crura cerebri, thalami optici, and corpora striata : it enters also into the composition of the locus perforatus, tuber cinereum, commissura mollis, pineal gland, pituitary gland, and corpora rhomboidea. Two kinds of grey substance are described by Eolando as existing in the spinal cord ; the one (substantia cinerea spongiosa vascu- losa) is the ordinary grey matter of the cord, the other {substantia cinerea gelatinosa) is found in the posterior cornua. The former resembles in structure the grey matter of the brain ; the latter is composed of small bodies resembling the blood corpuscules of the frog.NERVOUS SYSTEM.—DEVELOPMENT. 417 The fibres of the cerebro-spinal axis are arranged into two classes, diverging and converging. The diverging fibres proceed from the medulla oblongata, and diverge to every part of the surface of the brain; while the converging fibres commence at the surface and proceed inwards towards the centre, so as to connect the diverging fibres of opposite sides. In certain parts of their course the diverging fibres are separated by the grey substance, and increase in number so as to form a body of considerable size, which is called a ganglion. The position and mutual relations of these fibres and ganglia may be best explained by reference to the mode of develop- ment of the cerebro-spinal axis. The centre of the nervous system, in the lowest animals possessed of a lengthened axis, presents itself in the form of a double cord. A step higher in the animal scale, and knots or ganglia are developed on one extremity of this cord; such is the most rudimentary condi- tion of the brain in the lowest forms of vertebrata. In the lowest fishes the anterior extremity of the double cord displays a succession of five pairs of ganglia. The higher fishes and amphibia appear to have a different disposition of these primitive ganglia. The first or posterior two have become fused into a single ganglion, and then follow only three pairs of symmetrical ganglia. But if the larger pair be unfolded, after being hardened in alcohol, it will then be seen that the whole number of ganglia exist, but that four have become concealed by a thin covering that has spread across them. This condition of the brain carries us upwards in the animal scale even to Mammalia; e.g., in the dog or cat we find, first, a single ganglion, the cerebellum; then three pairs following each other in succession; and if we unfold the middle pair, we shall be at once convinced that it is composed of two pairs of primitive ganglia con- cealed by an additional development. Again, it will be observed, that the primitive ganglia of opposite sides, at first separate and disjoined, become connected by means of transverse fibres of commu- nication {commissures; commissura, a joining). The office of these commissures is the association in function of the two symmetrical portions. Hence we arrive at the general and important conclusion, that the brain, among the lower animals, consists of primitive cords, primitive ganglia upon those cords, and commissures which connect the substance of adjoining ganglia, and associate their functions. In the development of the cerebro-spinal axis in man, the earliest indication of the spinal cord is presented under the form of a pair of minute longitudinal filaments placed side by side. Upon these, towards the anterior extremity, five pairs of minute swellings are observed, not disposed in a straight line as in fishes, but curved upon each other so as to correspond with the direction of the future cranium. The posterior pair soon become cemented on the middle line, forming a single ganglion; the second pair also unite with each other; the third and fourth pairs, at first distinct, are speedily veiled by a lateral development, which arches backwards and conceals them; E E418 NERVOUS SYSTEM.—STRFCTURE. the anterior pair, at first very small, decrease in size, and become almost lost in the increased development of the preceding pairs. We see here a chain of resemblances corresponding with the pro- gressive development observed in the lower animals; the human brain is passing through the phases of improving development, which dis- tinguish the lowest from the lower creatures; and we are naturally led to the same conclusion with regard to the architecture of the human brain that we were led to establish as the principle of develop- ment in the inferior creatures, namely, that it is composed of pri- mitive cords, primitive ganglia upon those cords, commissures to connect those ganglia, and developments from those ganglia. In the adult, the primitive longitudinal cords have become ce- mented together, to form the spinal cord. But, at the upper ex- tremity, they separate from each other under the name of crura cerebri. The first pair of ganglia, developed from the primitive cords, have grown into the cerebellum; the second pair (the optic lobes of animals) have become the corpora quadrigemina of man. The third pair, the optic thalami, and the fourth, the corpora striata, are the basis of the hemispheres, which, the merest lamina in the fish, have become the largest portion of the brain in man. And the fifth pair (olfactory lobes), so large in the lowest forms, have dwindled into the olfactory bulbs of man. The microscopic elements of the nervous system, are, white nerve- fibres, grey nerve-fibres, nerve-cells, and nerve-granules. 1. White nerve-pibres are the chief constituent of the brain, the spinal cord, and the cerebro- spinal nerves, and they also enter into the composition of the sympa- thetic nerve. They present some variety of size in different parts of the nervous system, measuring in the brain between -^-^^and ^^^^^^ of an inch in diameter, and in the cerebro-spinal nerves between ginrn" and go^Qo of an inch. Asa general rule, the white nerve-fibres are largest in the nerves, smaller where they enter the cerebro-spinal mass, and smallest at their termination. Mode of termination of white nerve- libres in loops; three of these loops are simple, the fourth is convoluted. The latter is found in situations where an exalted degree of sensation exists. 2.

In structure, each white nerve- fibre is composed of a transparent and structureless cylindrical tubule or sheath (vagina medullaris), and of an axis-cylinder filled with an opalescent, colourless, oil-like fluid (neurine), which coagulates after death, and then resembles a white, opaque, curd-like matter. The vagina medullaris possesses somewhat less than one-third the thickness of the entire fibre, and gives to the latter, when examined with the microscope, the aspect of a double cylinder, an appearance which is characteristic of the white nerve-fibre. It is thickest m the fibres of the spinal nerves, and thinnest in those of the spinal cord, brain, and nerves of special sense. Hence in these latter, the sheath when pressed or stretched, is apt to assume a varicose appearance, and the contained substance to accumulate in small separate masses. White nerve-fibres terminate, both at the surface of the body, in the various internal organs, and in the substance of the cerebro-spinal axis, by forming loops. 2. Grey Nerve-fibres (fine nerve-fibres, gelatinous fibres, sympathetic fibres) are about one-half or one-third less in diameter ("STsif •sToTT of an inch, Henle) than the white fibres. They are less transparent, have no appearance of being composed of a double cylinder, and their sheath is less easily distinguishable from its contents. In structure, they consist of a thin and finely granulated sheath, filled with granular substance, and, when collected into a fasciculus, have a yellowish grey tint. The grey nerve-fibres are abundant in, and are indeed the chief constituent of, the sympathetic system. They are also present in the cerebro-spinal nerves, and most numerously in the nerves of sensation. They take their origin from the nerve-cells of the grey substance of the brain and spinal cord, from those of the ganglia on the posterior roots of the cerebro- spinal nerves, and from the nerve-cells of the ganglia of the sympathetic system. 3. The Nerve-cells are spherical, or oval, or polyhedral in shape, of a reddish-grey colour, and between and ytst i^^h in diameter. Each cell is composed of a capsular sheath, and contains in its interior a reddish-grey granular substance, and one or more nuclei and nucleoli, the nucleus being attached to the internal surface of the sheath. The sheath of the nerve-cell is constructed of three layers, the outermost consisting of fine granular corpuscles, the middle of nucleated cells of an oblong figure, and the internal of con- centric lamell93 of delicate cylindrical filaments. Dispersed through the substance of the cell are a greater or less number of pigment- granules, some being in the interior, and some in the sheath. Nerve- cells are found in the grey substance of the brain and spinal cord, in the ganglia of the cerebro-spinal nerves, and in the sympathetic ganglia and nerves. The nerve-cells of the grey substance of the brain are often very irregular in shape, and are also remarkable for their soft- ness and for the thinness of their sheath. It is the pigment-granules, E E 2420 NERVE-GRANULES. contained in the nerve-cells and nerve-granules, that give the pecu- liar tint of colour to the grey and dark substance of the cerebro- spinal axis. In the grey substance of the brain the nerve-cells may be seen in various stages of progressive development; thus, near the periphery, they are minute, spherical, or oval nucleated cells dispersed through a matrix of granular substance; more deeply, the granular substance is collected around the cells, and forms an exterior coat; while, at a greater depth, the cells have attained the size and the laminated sheaths of the fully formed nerve-cells. Nerve-cells offer many pe- culiarities in respect of number and arrangement in different parts of the nervous system. From the periphery of the nerve-cells one or more delicate thread- like processes, between yinnr -^(;)^oq of an inch in diameter, are given off. These are the origins of the grey nerve-fibres. ' 4. Nerve-granules present the three forms,—minute homoge- neous particles, aggregated particles, and nucleated corpuscles, varying in size between -g-fnnr x-gVo" of mch in diameter. They serve as the bond of connexion between the fibres and cells of the brain and spinal cord, particularly in the grey substance; and enter also into the composition of the various ganglia. Like nerve- cells, nerve-granules contain and have intermingled with them a variable number of pigment-granules. In the construction of a nerve the nerve-fibres are collected into small fasciculi, each fasciculus being invested by a distinct neuri- lemma. These fasciculi, again, are collected into bundles, forming larger fasciculi, which have also a separate neurilemma; and a bundle of the larger fasciculi, enclosed in a sheath or neurilemma of white fibrous tissue, constitutes a nerve. The neurilemma of the smaller fasciculi is smooth and semi-transparent, and remarkable for its satiny polish,—an appearance which is due to the longitudinal ar- rangement of the undulating fasciculi of fibrous tissue of which it is composed. Another character which the smaller nervous fasciculi possess, is that of being crossed by oblique or transverse lines, which are produced, in all probability, by the wrinkling of the neurilemma. In the fasciculi of grey fibres the tendency to wrinkle exists in the longitudinal direction, and the neurilemma is composed of an inner layer of circular filaments as well as an outer layer of longitudinal fila- ments of fibrous tissue. The nerve-fibres have no inosculations, but pursue an uninterrupted course from their central to their peripheral termination. In some instances they return after a short ciirve to the cerebro-spinal centre, as, for example, in the posterior part of the optic commissure, in the two roots of each spinal nerve, and in the loop formed between the descendens noni and the upper cervical nerves. In these cases, the fibres form a simple arch, both extremities of the arch maintaining a communication with the cerebro-spinal axis. In another instance,421 CONSTRUCTION OF NERVES. the direction of the curve is reversed, the centre of the arch being in the anterior part of the optic commissure, and the extremities in the retina. The communications which take place between nerves are termed plexuses. These plexuses are sometimes formed by the trunks of the nerves, as, the cervical, brachial, and lumbar; and sometimes by the fasciculi, as in the terminal plexuses at the periphery of the body and at the surface of the brain. The nerve-fibres in the spinal cord and central parts of the brain also form a close and plexiform interlace- ment with each other. In the construction of the larger plexuses there is a free interchange of fasciculi, and in the terminal plexuses a similar interchange of smaller fasciculi and primitive fibres. It is from the terminal plexuses that the nerve-fibres pass off to form their terminal loops. The general mode of termination of nerve-fibres is by loops. There exists, however, an exception to this rule in the instance of the Pacinian* corpuscles. These corpuscles are minute bodies, about a line in length, of an oval, oblong, or spheroidal shape, and smooth and glistening aspect, connected with the terminal nerve-fibres of the digital branches of the nerves distributed to the hands and feet. As many as two or three hundred are met with in a single hand. They are also found, but less numerously, on the terminal fibres of other sensitive nerves, and on the fibres of the sympathetic plexuses of the mesentery, mesocolon, and pancreas. They occur singly and in groups of two or three, and are each connected with the nerve by means of a short pedicle which projects into the corpuscle, and forms a conical process in its interior. The Pacinian corpuscle and its pedicle are composed of about fifty thin and membranous tunics, which are closely adherent in the latter, but are separated in the corpuscle by an albuminous fluid, and towards the free end of the corpuscle, the tunics are connected by imperfect septa. The central tunic or capsule is also filled with fluid, and into this fluid the axis cylinder of a primitive nervous fibril, derived from the nerve and continued through the centre of the peduncle, is pro- longed. According to Henle and Kolliker, this nervous fibril generally terminates in a small rounded enlargement; at other times it bifurcates and forms two rounded heads, and occasionally escapes from the corpuscle at its free end. Each of the tunics of the Pacinian body is composed of fibres which have a circular disposition on its external surface, and are arranged in a longitudinal direction within. It is these fibres which give to the corpuscle its glistening appear- ance. The Pacinian corpuscles are first perceptible during the sixth month of foetal life. On certain of the nerves of the body, for example on the posterior roots of the cranial and spinal nerves, and particularly on the sympa- * Discovered and described by Pacini in 1831; described more particularly in 1840; and by Henle. and Kolliker in 1844!,422 CLASSIFICATION OP NERVES, thetic, are situated enlargements which are termed ganglia. Ganglia are greyish in colour, invested by a smooth memhranons sheath, and composed of the three essential constituents of the nervous system, namely, nerve-cells, nerve-fibres, and nerve-granules. The nerve- cells of ganglia are firm in structure, and have stronger investing sheaths than those of the brain. From the exterior of their sheaths, filaments of fibrous tissue are given off, which interlace with each other, and hold the cells together; and at the same time form an investing network around the entire ganglion, the nerve-fibres passing into and out of the ganglion through the interstices of this network. Besides the sheath-filaments, certain of the nerve-cells give off" grey fibres, while others are free. The nerve-fibres of ganglia are of the two kinds met with in the rest of the nervous system. The white fibres are derived from the cerebro-spinal axis, and enter the sympa- thetic through the so-called roots of that nerve, namely, its commu- nications with the spinal nerves. In the ganglia these white fibres separate, and either pass directly onwards between the nerve-cells (traversing fibres), or make a series of turns around them (winding fibres); in either case they collect together after a plexiform course between the nerve-cells, and form fasciculi, which pass off as branches from the ganglion. The grey nerve-fibres originate from certain of the nerve-cells within the ganglion as finely granular threads, and pass away in the form of fasciculi, with or without association with the white fibres, to be distributed to the various organs, or to traverse other ganglia previously to their distribution. The nerve-granules occupy the interstices between the nerve-cells and nerve-fibres as in the cerebro-spinal mass. They are also con- tinued with the nerve-fibres, into some of the nerves given off by the ganglia. Like the interstitial substance of the brain, the granu- lar substance (gelatinous substance) of ganglia has intermingled with it minute cells and pigment granules. Nerves are divisible into two great classes; those which proceed directly from the cerebro-spinal axis, the cranial and spinal nerves, and constitute the system of animal life; and those which originate from the sympathetic system, or system of organic life. The division of nerves into cranial and spinal is purely arbitrary, and depends on the circumstance of the former passing through the foramina of the cranium, and the latter through those of the verte- bral column. "With respect to origin, all the cranial nerves with the exception of the first (olfactory), proceed from the spinal cord, or from its immediate prolongation into the brain. The spinal nerves arise by two roots; anterior, which proceeds from the anterior segment of the spinal cord, and possesses a motor function; and posterior, which is connected with the posterior segment, and be- stows the faculty of sensation. The motor nerves of the cranium are shown by dissection to be continuous with the motor portion of the cord, and form one system with the motor roots of the spinal cord; while the nerves of sensation, always excepting the olfac-423 ORIGIN OF NERVES. tory, are in like manner traced to tlie posterior segment of the cord, and form part of the system of sensation. To these two systems a third was added by Sir Charles Bell, the respiratory system, which consists of nerves associated in the function of respi- ration, and arising from the side of the upper part of the spinal cord in one continuous line, which he thence named the respiratory tract. The microscope has failed in making out any structural dis- tinction between the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves ; but the latter are remarkable for the possession of a ganglion near their attachment with the cord. This ganglion is observed upon the posterior roots of all the spinal nerves, and also upon the corresponding root of the fifth cranial nerve, which is thence considered a spinal cranial nerve. Upon others of the cranial nerves a ganglion is found, which associates them in function with the nerves of sensation, and establishes an analogy with the spinal nerves. According to Mr. Grrainger, both roots of the spinal nerves, as well as those of most of the cerebral, divide into two sets of fibres upon entering the cord, one set being connected with the grey substance, whilie the other is continuous with its white or fibrous part. The former he considers to be the agents of the excito-motory system of Dr. Marshall Hall; and the latter, a communication with the brain and the medium of transmission of sensation a,nd volition. He has not. been able to trace the fibres which enter the grey substance to their termination; but he thinks it probable that the ultimate fibres of the posterior root join those of the anterior root; or in the words of Dr. Marshall Hall's system, that the incident fibres (sensitive) are continuous with the reflex (motor). The connexion of a nerve with the cerebro-spinal axis is called, for convenience of description, its origin ; this term must not, how- ever, be taken literally, for each nerve is developed in the precise situation which it occupies in the body, and with the same relations that it possesses in after life. Indeed, we not unfrequently meet with instances in anencephalous foetuses, where the nerves are com- pletely formed, while the brain and spinal cord are wanting. The word "origin" must therefore be considered as a relic of the dark- ness of bygone ages, when the cerebro-spinal axis was looked upon as the tree from which the nerves pushed forth as branches. In their distrihution the spinal nerves for the most part follow the course of the arteries, particularly in the limbs, where they lie almost constantly to the outer side of and superficially to the vessels, as if for the purpose of receiving the first intimation of danger, and com- municating it to the muscles, that the latter may instantly remove the arteries from impending injury. The Sympathetic system consists of numerous ganglia, of commu- nicating branches passing between the ganglia, of others passing between the ganglia and the cerebro-spinal axis, and of branches of distribution which are remarkable for their frequent and plexiformBRAIN. —MEMBRANES. 424 communications. The sympathetic nerves also differ from other nerves in their colour, which is of a reddish-grey tint. The capillary vessels of nerves are very minute. They run parallel with the nervous fasciculi, and every here and there are connected by transverse communications, so as to give rise to a network composed of oblong meshes very similar to the capillary system of muscles. The Nervous system may be divided for convenience of description into 1. The brain. 2. The spinal cord. 3. The cranial nerves. 4. The spinal nerves. 5. The sympathetic system. the brain. The brain is a collective term which signifies those parts of the nervous system, exclusive of the nerves themselves, which are con- tained within the cranium: they are the cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata.* These are invested and protected by the mem- branes of the brain, and the whole together constitute the encephalon {kv KEcpaXi^, within the head). membranes of the encephalon. Dissection.—To examine the encephalon with its membranes, the upper part of the skull must be removed, by sawing through the ex- ternal table and breaking the internal table with the chisel and hammer. After the calvarium has been loosened all round, it will require a considerable degree of force to tear the bone away from the dura mater. This adhesion is particularly firm at the sutures, where the dura mater is continuous with a membranous layer interposed between the edges of the bones; in other situations, the connexion results from numerous vessels which permeate the inner table of the skull. The adhesion subsisting between the dura mater and bone is greater in the young subject and in old persons than in the adult. On being torn away, the internal table will present numerous deeply grooved and ramified channels, corresponding with the branches of the arteria meningea media. Along the middle line will be seen a groove corresponding with the superior longitudinal sinus, and on either side may be frequently observed some small fossee, corre- sponding with the Pacchionian bodies. The membranes of the encephalon and spinal cord are the dura mater, arachnoid membrane, and pia mater. The Dura MATERf is the firm, whitish or greyish layer which is brought into view when the calvarium is removed. It is a strong * The average weight of the human brain is three pounds for the male, and four or five ounces less for the female; the medium weight for the male ranging between forty-six and fifty-three ounces, and for the female between forty-one and forty-seven.

Lining the interior of the cranium, it serves as the internal periosteum of that cavity; it is prolonged also into the spinal column, under the name of theca vertebralis, but is not ad- herent to the bones in that canal as in the cranium. From the internal surface of the dura mater, processes are directed inwards for the support and protection of parts of the brain; while from its exte- rior, other processes are prolonged outwards to form sheaths for the nerves as they quit the skull and. spinal column. Its external sur- face is rough and fibrous, and corresponds with the internal table of the skull. The internal surface is smooth, and lined by the thin varnish-like lamella of the arachnoid membrane. The latter is a serous membrane. Hence the dura mater becomes a fibro-serous membrane, being composed of its own proper fibrous structure, and the serous layer derived from the arachnoid. There are two other instances of fibro-serous membrane in the body, formed in the same way—namely, the pericardium and tunica albuginea of the testicle. On the external surface of the dura mater the branches of the middle meningeal artery may be seen ramifying ; and in the middle line is a depressed groove, formed by the subsidence of the upper wall of the superior longitudinal sinus. If the sinus be opened along its course, it will be found to be a triangular channel, crossed at its lower angle by numerous white bands, called chordae Willisii ;* granular bodies are also occasionally seen in its interior, these are glandulse Pacchioni. The Glandules. Pacchionii' are small, round, whitish granula- tions, occurring singly or in clusters, and forming small groups of various size along the margin of the longitudinal fissure of the cere- brum, and more particularly near the summit of the latter. These bodies would seem to be c£ morbid origin ; they are absent in infancy, increase in numbers in adult life, and are abundant in the aged. They are generally associated with opacity of the arachnoid around their bases, but in some instances are wanting even in the adult. They have their point of attachment in the pia mater, from which they seem to spring, carrying with them the arachnoid mem- brane, and then, in proportion to their size, producing various effects upon contiguous parts. For example, when small, they remain free or constitute a bond of adhesion between the visceral and parietal layer of the arachnoid : when of larger size they pro- duce absorption of the dura mater, and as the degree of absorption is greater or less, they protrude through that membrane, and form * Willis lived in the seventeenth century; he was a great defender of the opinions of Harvey. t These bodies are incorrectly described as conglobate glands by Pacchioni, in an epistolatory dissertation, " De Glandulis conglobatis Durse Meningis indeque ortis Lymphaticis ad Piam Matrem productis," pubhshed at Rome, in 1705.DURA MATER. 426 depressions on the inner surface of the cranium, or simply render the dura mater thin and cribriform. Sometimes they cause absorp- tion of the wall of the longitudinal sinus, and projecting into its cavity, give rise to the granulations described in connexion with that channel. If the student cut through one side of the dura mater, in the direc- tion of his incision through the skull, and turn it upwards towards the middle line, he will observe the smooth internal surface of this membrane. He will perceive also the large veins of the hemispheres filled with dark blood, and passing from behind forwards to open into the superior longitudinal sinus ; and the firm connexion, by means of these veins and the Pacchionian bodies, between the opposed surfaces of the arachnoid membrane. If he separate these adhesions with his scalpel, he will see a vertical layer of dura mater descending between the hemispheres ; and if he draw one side of the brain a little outwards, he will be enabled to perceive the extent of the process of membrane, which is called the falx cerebri. The processes of dura mater which are sent inwards towards the interior of the skull, are the falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli, and falx cerehelli. The Falx cerebri (falx, a sickle), so named from its sickle-like appearance, narrow in front, broad behind, and forming a sharp curved edge below, is attached in front to the crista galli process of the ethmoid bone, and behind to the tentorium cerebelli. The Tentorium cerebelli (tentorium, a tent) is a roof of dura mater, thrown across the cerebellum and attached at each side to the margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone ; behind, to the transverse ridge of the occipital bone, which lodges the lateral sinuses ; and to the clinoid processes in front. It supports the posterior lobes of the cerebrum and prevents their pressure* on the cerebellum, leaving only a small opening anteriorly, for the trans- mission of the crura cerebri. The Falx cerebelli is a small process, generally double, attached to the vertical ridge of the occipital bone beneath the lateral sinus, and to the tentorium. It is received into the indentation between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum. The layers of the dura mater separate in several situations, so as to form irregular channels which receive the venous blood. These are the sinuses of the dura mater, which have been described at page 387. The student cannot see the tentorium and falx cerebelli until the brain is removed ; but he should consider the attachments of the former on the dried skull, for he will have to incise it in the removal of the brain. He should now proceed to that operation, for which purpose the dura mater is to be divided all round, on a level with * In leaping animals, as the feline and canine genera, the tentorium forms a bony tent.ARACHNOID MEMBRANE. 427 the section through the skull, and the scissors are to be carried deejjly between the hemispheres of the brain in front, to cut through the anterior part of the falx; then draw the dura mater backwards, and leave it hanging by its attachment to the tentorium, Eaise the anterior lobes of the brain carefully with the hand, and lift the olfactory bulbs from the cribriform fossse with the handle of the scalpel. Then cut across the two optic nerves and internal carotid arteries. Next divide the infundibulum and third nerves, and carry the knife along the margin of the petrous bone at each side, so as to divide the tentorium near its attachment. Cut across the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth nerves in succession with a sharp knife, and pass the scalpel as far down as possible into the vertebral canal, to sever the spinal cord, cutting first to one side and then to the other, in order to divide the vertebral arteries and first cervical nerves. Then let him press the cerebellum gently upwards with the fingers of the right hand, the hemispheres being supported with the left, and the brain will roll into his hand. The Arteries of the dura mater are the anterior meningeal from the ethmoidal, ophthalmic, and internal carotid. The middle meningeal and meningea parva from the internal maxillary. The inferidr meningeal from the ascending pharyngeal and occipital artery ; and the posterior meningeal from the vertebral. Its Nerves are derived from the nervi molles and vertebral plexus of the sympathetic, from the Casserian ganglion, the ophthalmic nerve, and sometimes from the fourth. The branches from the two latter are given off while those nerves are situated by the side of the sella turcica ; they are recurrent, and pass backwards between the layers of the tentorium, to the lining membrane of the lateral sinus. Purkinje describes a sympathetic plexus of considerable size, as being situated around the vena Galeni at its entrance into the fourth sinus. The filaments from this plexus are distributed to the tentorium. Arachnoid membrane. The Arachnoid {apaxvq eWog, like a spider's web), so named from its extreme tenuity, is the serous membrane of the cerebro- spinal centre ; and, like other serous membranes, a shut sac. It envelopes the brain and spinal cord {visceral layer) and is reflected on the inner surface of the dura mater (parietal layer), giving to that membrane its serous investment. On the upper surface of the hemispheres the arachnoid is trans- parent, but may be demonstrated as it passes across the sulci from one convolution to another by injecting with a blow-pipe, a stream of air beneath it. At the base of the brain the membrane is opales- cent and thicker than in other situations, and more easily demon- strable from the circumstance of stretching across the interval between the middle lobes of the hemispheres. The space which is included between this layer of membrane and those parts ofARACHNOID MEMBRANE. 428 the base of tlie brain which are bounded by the optic commis- sure and fissures of Sylvius in front, and the pons Varolii behind, is termed the anterior sub-arachnoidean space. Another space formed in a similar manner, between the under part of the cere- bellum and the medulla oblongata is the posterior sub-arachnoidean space; and a third space, situated over the corpora quadrigemina, may be termed the superior sub-arachnoidean space. These spaces communicate freely with each other, the anterior and posterior across the crura cerebelli, the anterior and the superior around the crura cerebri, and the latter and the posterior across the cerebellum in the course of the vermiform processes. They communicate also with a still larger space formed by the loose disposition of the arachnoid around the spinal cord, the spinal sub-arachnoidean space. The whole of these spaces, with the lesser spaces between the convolutions of the hemispheres, constitute one large and con- tinuous cavity which is filled with a limpid, serous secretion, the sub-arachnoidean or cerebrospinal fluid, * a fluid which is neces- sary to the maintenance and protection of the cerebro-spinal mass. The quantity of the cerebro-spinal fluid is determined by the rela- tive size of the cerebro-spinal axis and that of the containing cavity, and is consequently very variable. It is smaller in youth than in old age, and in the adult has been estimated at about two ounces. The visceral layer of the arachnoid is connected to the pia mater by a delicate cellular tissue, which in the sub-arachnoidean spaces is loose and filamentous. The serous secretion of the true cavity of the arachnoid is very small in quantity as compared with the sub-arachnoidean fluid. The arachnoid does not enter into the ventricles of the brain, as imagined by Bich^t, but is reflected inwards upon the venae Galeni for a short distance only, and returns upon those vessels to the dura mater of the tentorium. It surrounds the nerves as they originate from the brain, and forms a sheath around them to their point of exit from the skull. It is then reflected back upon the inner sur- face of the dura mater. According to Mr. Ilainey,+ vessels of considerable size, but few in number, and branches of cranial nerves, are found in the arachnoid. He also describes, in this membrane, numberless plexuses and ganglia, which he considers to be analogous to those of the sympa- thetic nerve. The fibres proceeding from this source are'distributed on the arteries and nerves of the cerebro-spinal axis, but particularly on the former. * The presence of a serous fluid beneath the arachnoid has given rise to the conjecture that a sub-arachnoid serous membrane may exist in that situation. Such a supposition is quite unnecessary to explain the production of the secretion, since the pia mater is fully adequate to the function. t Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, toI. 29.429 CEEEBRUM, Pia mater. The Pia mater is a vascular membrane composed of innumerable vessels held together by a thin layer of cellular tissue. It invests the whole surface of the brain, dipping into the sulci between the convolutions, and forming a fold in its interior called velum inter- positum. It also forms folds in other situations, as in the third and fourth ventricles, and in the longitudinal fissures of the spinal cord. This membrane differs in structure in different parts of the cerebro-spinal axis. Thus, on the surface of the cerebrum, in con- tact with the soft grey matter of the brain, it is extremely vascular, forming remarkable loops of anastomoses in the interspaces of the convolutions, and distributing multitudes of minute straight vessels (tomentum cerebri) to the grey substance. In the substantia per- forata, again, and locus perforatus, it gives off tufts of small arteries, which pierce the white matter to reach the grey substance in the interior. But upon the crura cerebri, pons Varolii, and spinal cord, its vascular character seems almost lost. It has be- come a dense fibrous membrane, difficult to tear off, and forming the proper sheath of the spinal cord. The' pia mater is the nutrient membrane of the brain, and derives its blood from the internal carotid and vertebral arteries. Its Nerves are the minute filaments of the sympathetic, which accompany the branches of the arteries. CEREBRUM. The Cerebrum presents on its surface a number of slightly convex elevations, the convolutions (gyri), which are separated from each other by sulci of various depth. * It is divided superiorly into two hemispheres by the great longitudinal fissure, which lodges the falx cerebri, and marks the original development of the brain by two symmetrical halves. Each hemisphere, upon its under surface, admits of a division into three lobes, anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior lobe rests upon the roof of the orbit, and is separated from the middle by the fissure of Sylvius, f The middle lobe is received into the middle fossa of the base of the skull, and is separated from the posterior by a slight impression produced by the ridge of the petrous bone. The posterior lobe is supported by the tentorium.

This section, from exhibiting the largest surface of medullary sub- stance demonstrable in a single hemisphere, is called centrum ovale miniis ; it is spotted by numerous small red points (puncta vascu- losa) which are produced by the escape of blood from the cut ends of minute arteries and veins.

If the upper part of each hemisphere be removed to a level with the corpus callosum, a large expanse of medullary matter, surrounded by a zigzag line of grey substance cor- responding with the convolutions and sulci of the two hemispheres, will be seen ; this is the centrum ovale majus of Vieussens. The Corpus callosum (callosus, hard) is a thick layer of medullary fibres passing transversely between the two hemispheres, and consti- tuting their great commissure (trabs cerebri, beam of the brain). It is situated in the middle line of the centrum ovale majus, but nearer the anterior than the posterior part of the brain, and terminates anteriorly in a rounded border (genu), which may be traced down- wards to the base of the brain in front of the commissure of the optic nerves. Posteriorly it forms a thick rounded fold (splenium), which is continuous with the fornix. The length of the corpus callosum is about four inches. Beneath the posterior rounded border of the corpus callosum is the transverse fissure of the cerebrum, which extends between the hemi- spheres; and crura cerebri from near the fissure of Sylvius on one side, to the same point on the opposite side of the brain. It is through this fissure that the pia mater communicates with the velum inter- positum. And it was here that Bichat conceived the arachnoid to enter the ventricles; hence it is also named the fissure of Bichat. Along the middle line of the corpus callosum is the raphe, a linear depression between two slightly elevated longitudinal bands (chordae longitudinales, Lancisii) ; and, on either side of the raphe, may be seen the linece transversce, which mark the direction of the fibres of which the corpus callosum is composed. These fibres may be traced into the hemispheres on either side, and they will be seen to be crossed at about an inch from the raphe by the longitudinal fibres of the covered band of Reil. Anteriorly and posteriorly the fibres of the corpus callosum curve forwards and backwards into their cor- responding lobes. If a superficial incision be made through the corpus callosum on either side of the raphe, two irregular cavities will be opened, which extend from one extremity of the hemispheres to the other: these are the lateral ventricles. To expose them completely, their upper boundary should be removed with the scissors. In making this dissection the thin and diaphanous membrane of the ventricles may frequently be seen. Lateral ventricles.—Each lateral ventricle is divided into a central cavity and three smaller cavities called cornua. The anterior cornu curves forwards and outwards in the anterior lobe; the middle cornu descends into the middle lobe ; and the posterior cornu passes backwards in the posterior lobe, converging towards its fellow of theLATEEAL VENTEICLES. 432 opposite side. The central cavity is triangular in form, heing bounded above {roof) by the corpus callosum ; internally by the septum lucidum, vi^bich separates it from the opposite ventricle ; and below {floor) by the following parts, taken in their order of position from before backwards:— Corpus striatum, Choroid plexus, Tenia semicircularis. Corpus fimbriatum, Thalamus opticus. Fornix. The Corpus striatum is named from the striated lines of white and grey matter which are seen upon cutting into its substance. It is grey on the exterior, and of a pyriform shape. The broad end, directed forwards, rests against the corpus striatum of the opposite side: the small end, backwards, is separated from its fellow by the interposition of-the thalami optici. The corpora striata are the superior ganglia of the cerebrum. The Tenia semicirculans (tenia, a fillet) is a narrow band of medul- lary substance, extending along the posterior border of the corpus striatum, and serving as a bond of connexion between that body and the thalamus opticus. It is transparent and dense at the surface, and received from Tarinus* the name oi horny hand. The tenia is partly concealed by a large vein {vena corporis sfWa^i), which receives numerous small veins from the corpus striatum and thalamus opticus, and terminates in the vena Galeni of its own side. The Thalamus opticus {thalamus, a bed) is an oblong body, having a thin coating of white substance on its surface; and has received its name from giving origin to one root of the optic nerve. It is the inferior ganglion of the cerebrum. Part only of the thala- mus is seen in the floor of the lateral ventricle; we must, therefore, defer its further description until we can examine it in its entire extent. The Choroid plexus {xopiov, eWog, resembling the chorion)^ is a vascular fringe extending obliquely across the floor of the lateral ventricle, and sinking into the middle cornu. Anteriorly, it is small and tapering, and communicates with the choroid plexus of the opposite ventricle, through a large oval opening, the foramen of Monro, or foramen commune anterius. This foramen maybe seen by pulling slightly on the plexus, and pressing aside the septum lucidum with the handle of the knife. It is situated be- tween the under surface of the fornix, and the anterior extremities of the thalami optici, and forms a communication transversely be- tween the lateral ventricles, and perpendicularly with the third ventricle. The choroid plexus presents upon its surface a number of minute * Peter Tarin, a French anatomist; his work, entitled "Adversaria Anato- mica," was published in 1750. t See the note appended to the description of the choroid coat of the eyeball.LATERAL VENTEICLES. 433 vascular processes, which are termed villi.

In their interior the plexuses not nnfreqnently contain particles of calcareous matter, and they are sometimes covered hj sma,ll clusters of serous cysts. The Corpus fimibriatum is a narrow white band, situated imme- diately behind the choroid plexus, and extending with it into the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. It is, in fact, the lateral thin edge of the fornix, and being attached to the hippocampus major in the descending horn of the lateral ventricle, is also termed, tenia hippocampi. The Fornix is a white layer of medullary substance, of which a portion only is seen in this view of the ventricle. The Anterior cornu is triangular in form, sweeping outwards, and terminating by a point in the anterior lobe of the brain, at a short distance from its surface. The Posterior cornu or digital cavity curves inwards, as it ex- tends back into the posterior lobe of the brain, and likewise ter- minates near the surface. An elevation corresponding with a deep sulcus between two convolutions, projects into the area of this cornu, and is called the hippocampus minor. The Middle or descending cornu, in descending into the middle lobe of the brain, forms a very considerable curve, and alters its direction several times as it proceeds. Hence it is described as passing backwards and outwards and downwards, and then turning forwards and inwards. This complex expression of a very simple curve has given origin to a symbol formed by the primary letters ot these various terms; and by means of this the student recollects with ease the course of the cornu, bodpi. It is the largest of the three cornua, and terminates close to the fissure of Sylvius, after having curved around the crus cerebri. The middle cornu should now be laid open, by inserting the little finger into its cavity, and making it serve as a director for the scalpel in cutting away the side of the hemisphere, so as to expose it completely. The Superior boundary of the middle cornu is formed by the under surface of the thalamus opticus, upon which are the two pro- jections called corpus geniculatum internum and externum; and the inferior wall by the following parts : The Hippocampus major or cornu Ammonis, so called from its resemblance to a ram's horn, the famous crest of Jupiter Ammon, is a considerable projection from the inferior wall, and extends the whole length of the middle cornu. Its extremity is likened to the foot of an animal, from - its presenting a number of knuckle-like Hippocampus major, Pes hippocampi. Pes accessorius. Corpus fimbriatum, Choroid plexus.

The hippocampus major is the internal surface of the convolution (gyrus fornicatus) of the lateral edge of the hemisphere, the convolution which has been previously described as lying upon the corpus cal- losum and extending downwards to the base of the brain to termi- nate at the fissure of Sylvius. If it be cut across, the section will be seen to resemble the extremity of a convoluted scroll, consisting of alternate layers of white and grey substance. The hippocampus major is continuous superiorly with the fornix and corpus callosum, and derives its medullary layer from the corpus fimbriatum. The Pes accessorius (eminentia collateralis) is a swelling some- what resembling the hippocampus major, but smaller in size, and situated in the angular interval between it and the hippocampus minor. Like the latter, it is formed by the protrusion of one of the sulci of the convolutions. The Corpus fimbriatum (tenia hippocampi) is the narrow white band which is prolonged from the central cavity of the ventricle, and is attached along the inner border of the hippocampus major. It is lost inferiorly in the hippocampus. Fascia dentata.—If the corpus fimbriatum be carefully raised a narrow serrated band of grey substance, the margin of the grey substance of the middle lobe, will be seen beneath it; this is the fascia dentata. Beneath the corpus fimbriatum will be likewise seen the transverse fissure of the brain, which has been before de- scribed as extending from near the fissure of Sylvius on one side, across to the same point on the opposite side. It is through this fissure that the pia mater communicates with the choroid plexus, and the latter obtains its supply of blood. The fissure is bounded on one side by the corpus fimbriatum, and on the other by the under surface of the thalamus opticus. The internal boundary of the lateral ventricle is the septum lucidum. This septum is thin, semi-transparent, and consists of two laminae of cerebral substance attached above to the under surface of the corpus callosum at its anterior part, and below to the fornix. Between the two layers is a narrow space, the fifth ventricle, which is lined by a proper membrane. The fifth ventricle may be shown, by snipping through the septum lucidum transversely with the scissors. The corpus callosum should now be cut across towards its anterior extremity, and the two ends carefully dissected away. The anterior portion will be retained only by the septum lucidum, but the posterior will be found incorporated with the white layer beneath, which is the fornix. Fornix.—The fornix (arch) is a triangular lamina of white substance, broad behind, and extending into each lateral ventricle : narrow in front, where it terminates in two crura, which arch down- wards to the base of the brain. The two crura descend in a curved direction to the base of the brain, embedded in grey substance, in the F F 2436 FORNIX. lateral walls of tlie third ventricle, and lying directly behind the anterior commissure. At the base of the brain they make a sudden curve upon themselves and constitute the corpora albicantia, from which they may be traced upwards to their origin in the thalami optici. Opening transversely beneath these two crura, just as they are about to arch downwards, is the foramen of communication Fig. 159.* * The mesial surface of a longitudinal section of the brain.

The choroid plexuses communicate, and the veins of the corpora striata pass through this opening. The lateral thin edges of the fornix are continuous ]iosteriorly with the concave border of the hippocampus major at each side, and form the narrow white band called corpus fimhriatum (posterior crus of the fornix). In the middle line the fornix is continuous with the corpus callosum, and at each side with the hippocampus major and minor. On the under surface of the fornix towards its posterior part some transverse lines are seen passing between the diverging corpora fimbriata: this appearance is termed the lyra (corpus psalloides), from a fancied resemblance to the strings of a harp. The fornix may now be removed by dividing it across anteriorly, and turning it backwards, at the same time separating its lateral connexions with the hippocampi. If the student examine its under surface, he will perceive the lyra above described. Beneath the fornix is the velum interpositum (tela choroidea), a duplicature of pia mater introduced into the interior of the brain, through the transverse fissure. The velum is continuous at each side with the choroid plexus, and contains in its inferior layer two large veins (the venm Galeni) which receive the blood from the corpora striata and choroid plexuses, and terminate posteriorly, after uniting into a single trunk, in the straight sinus. On the under surface of the velum interpositum are two fringe-like bodies, which project into the third ventricle. These are the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle; posteriorly these fringes enclose the pineal gland. If the velum interpositum be raised and turned back, an operation to be conducted with care, particularly at its posterior part where it invests the pineal gland, the thalami optici and the cavity of the third ventricle will be brought into view. Thalami optici.—The thalami optici, are two oblong, square- shaped bodies, of a white colour superficially, inserted between the two diverging portions of the corpora striata. In the middle line a fissure exists between them which is called the third ventricle. Posteriorly and inferiorly, they form the superior wall of the descend- ing cornu of the lateral ventricle, and present two rounded elevations called corpus geniculatum externum and internum. The corpus geniculatum externum^ the larger of the two, and of a greyish colour, is the principal origin of the optic nerve. Anteriorly, the thalami are connected with the corpora albicantia by means of two white bands, which appear to originate in the white substance (tenia semicircularis) uniting the thalami to the corpora striata. Externally they are in relation with the corpora striata and hemispheres. In their interior the thalami are composed of white fibres mixed with grey substance. They are essentially the inferior ganglia of the cerebrum. Third ventricle.—The third ventricle is the fissure between the438 THIRD VENTRICLE. two thalami optici. It is bounded above by the tinder surface of tbe velum interpositum, from wbich are suspended the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle. Its floor is formed by the grey sub- stance of the anterior termi- nation of the corpus callosum, called lamina cinerea, the tuber cinereum, corpora albi- cantia, and locus perforatus. Laterally, it is bounded by the thalami optici; anteriorly by the anterior commissure and crura of the fornix ; and posteriorly by the posterior commissure and the iter a tertio ad quartum ventricu- lum. The third ventricle is crossed by three commissures, anterior, middle, and poste- rior; and between these are two spaces, called foramen commune anterius and fora- men commune posterius. The Anterior commissure is a small rounded white cord, which enters the corpus striatum at either side, and spreads out in the substance * The third and fourth ventricles. 1.

The space between the anterior and middle commissure is called the foramen commune anterius, and is that to which Monro has given his name (foramen of Monro). It is the medium of communication between the two lateral and third ventricles, and transmits superiorly the choroid plexus and venae corporum striatorum. The foramen commune anterius is also termed, iter ad infundibulum, from leading downwards to the funnel-shaped cavity of the infundibulum. The crura of the fornix are embedded in the lateral walls of the foramen commune, and are concealed from view in this situation by the layer of grey substance which lines the interior of the third ventricle. If the crura be slightly separated, the anterior commissure will be seen immediately in front of them, crossing from one corpus striatum to the other. The space between the middle and posterior commissure is the foramen commune posterius; it is much shallower than the preceding, and is the origin of a canal, the aqueduct of Sylvius or iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum, which leads backwards be- neath the posterior commissure and through the base of the corpora quadrigemina to the upper part of the fourth ventricle. Corpora quadrigemina.—The corpora quadrigemina, or optic lobes, are situated immediately behind the third ventricle and poste- rior commissure; and beneath the posterior border of the corpus callosum. They form, indeed, at this point, the inferior boundary of the transverse fissure of the hemispheres, the fissure of Bichat. The anterior pair of these bodies, grey in colour, are named nates: the posterior pair, white and much smaller than the anterior, are termed testes. From the nates on each side may be traced a rounded process (brachium anterius) which passes obliquely outwards into the thalamus opticus; and from the testis a similar but smaller process (brachium posterius) which has the same destination. The corpus geniculatum internum lies in the interval of these two processes where they enter the thalamus, and behind the brachium posterius is a prominent band (laqueus) which marks the course of the superior division of the fasciculus olivaris. The corpora quadrigemina are perforated longitudinally through their base by the aqueduct of Sylvius ; they are co veered in partly by the pia mater and partly by the velum interpositum, and the nates support the pineal gland. Pineal gland.—The pineal gland is a small reddish-grey body of a conical form (hence its synonym conarium), situated on the anterior part of the nates and invested by a duplicature of pia mater derived from the under part of the velum interpositum., The pineal gland when pressed between the fingers is found to contain a gritty matter (acervulus) composed chemically of phosphate and carbonate of lime, and phosphate of magnesia and ammonia; it is sometimes hollow in440 FOURTH VENTEICLE. the interior. It is connected to the brain by means of two medullary cords called 'peduncles and a thin lamina derived from the posterior commissure; the peduncles of the pineal gland are attached to the thalami optici, and may be traced along the upper and inner margin of those bodies to the crura of the fornix with which they become blended. From the close connexion subsisting between the pia mater and the pineal gland, and the softness of texture of the latter, the gland is liable to be torn away in the removal of the pia mater. Behind the corpora quadrigemina is the cerebellum, and beneath the cerebellum the fourth ventricle. The student must therefore divide the cerebellum down to the fourth ventricle, and turn its lobes aside to examine that cavity. Fourth ventricle.—The fourth ventricle (sinus rhomboidalis) is the ventricle of the cerebellum. It is situated on the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata and pons Varolii, is lozenge-shaped in its form, and hounded on each side by a thick cord passing between the cerebellum and corpora quadrigemina, called the processus e cerebello ad testes, and by the corpus restiforme. It is covered in behind by the cerebellum, and by a thin lamella of medullary sub- stance, stretched between the two processus e cerebello ad testes, termed the valve of Vieussens* That portion of the cerebellum which forms the posterior boundary of the fourth ventricle presents four small prominences or lobules, and a thin layer of medullary substance, the velum, medullare poste- rius. Of the lobules two are placed in the middle line, the nodulus and uvula, the former being before the latter ; the remaining two are named amygdala?, or tonsils, and are situated one on either side of the uvula. They all project into the cavity of the fourth ventricle, and the velum medullare posterius is situated in front of them. The valve of Vieussens or velum medullare anterius is an extremely thin lamella of medullary substance, prolonged from the white matter of the cerebellum to the testes, and attached on each side to the processus e cerebello ad testes. This lamella is overlaid for a short distance by a thin, transversely-grooved lobule of grey substance (linguetta laminosa) derived from the anterior border of the cerebellum, and its junction with the testes is strengthened by a narrow slip given off by the commissure of those bodies, the frcemdum veli medullaris ante- rioris. The anterior wall, or floor of the fourth ventricle is formed by two slightly convex bodies,/ascicM^i ^ere^es(innominati), separated by a longitudinal groove which is continuous inferiorly with the posterior median fissure of the spinal cord. On these bodies the grey substance (fasciolse cinereee) derived from the interior of the medulla is spread out, and at the lower part of the ventricle forms * Eaymond Vieussens, a great discoverer in the anatomy of the brain and nervous system. His " Neurographia Universalis" was published at Lyons, in 1685.CEREBELLUM. 44] several eminences or nuclei, from whicli, according to Stilling, the eighth, and ninth nerves, and probably also the fifth, take their origin. Higher up the fasciculi teretes are crossed by several white strise (lineae transversse), the origin of the auditory nerves. Upon the lower part of the floor of this ventricle is an impression resembling the point of a pen, and hence named calamus scriptorius; the lateral boundaries of the calamus are the processus clavati of the posterior pyramids. Above, the fourth ventricle is bounded by the corpora quadrigemina and aqueduct of Sylvius ; and helow by a layer of pia mater and arachnoid, called the valve of the arachnoid. Beneath this valve a communication exists between the ventricles of the brain and the subarachnoidean space. Within the fourth ventricle and lying against the uvula and tonsils are two small vascular fringes formed by the pia mater, the choroid plexuses of the fourth ventricle. LINING MEMBRANE OF THE VENTRICLES. The lining membrane of the ventricles is a serous layer distinct from the arachnoid ; it lines the whole of the interior of the lateral ventricles, and is connected above and below with the attached border of the choroid plexus, so as to exclude all communication between the lateral ventricles and the exterior of the brain. From the lateral ventricles it is reflected through the foramen of Monro on each side into the third ventricle, which it invests throughout. From the third it is conducted into the fourth ventricle, through the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum, and after lining its interior becomes continuous inferiorly with the sub-arachnoidean space of the spinal cord. The lining membrane of the ventricles is provided with a ciliated epithe- lium, and is the source of the secretion which moistens and lubricates their interior. The fifth ventricle has a separate lining membrane. CEREBELLUM. The Cerebellum (figs.159, 161, 162), seven times smaller than the cerebrum, is situated beneath the posterior cerebral lobes, being lodged in the posterior fossa of the base of the cranium, and protected from the superincumbent pressure of the cerebrum by the tentorium cerebelli. Like the cerebrum, it is composed of grey and white sub- stance, the former occupying the surface, the latter the interior, and its surface is formed of parallel lamellse separated by sulci, and here and there by deeper sulci. In form the cerebellum is oblong and flattened, its greater diameter being from side to side, its two surfaces looking upwards and downwards, and its borders being anterior, posterior, and lateral. In consideration of its shape the cerebellum admits of a division into two hemispheres, into certain prominences termed processes and lobules, and into certain divisions of its sub- stance called lobes, formed upon the hemispheres by the deeper sulciCEREBELLUM. 442 above referred to. The two hemispheres are separated from each other on the upper surface of the cerebellum by a longitudinal ridge, which is termed the superior vermiform process, and which forms a commissure between them. On the anterior border of the organ there is a semilunar notch, incisura cerehelli anterior, which embraces the corpora quadrigemina. On the posterior border there is another notch incisura cerehelli posterior, which receives the upper part of the falx cerehelli: and on the under surface of the cerebellum is a deep fissure corresponding with the medulla oblongata, and termed the vallecula (valley). Each hemisphere of the cerebellum is divided by means of a fissure (sulcus horizontalis) which runs along its free border, into an upper and a lower portion, and upon each of these portions certain lobes are marked out. Thus on the upper portion there are two such lobes separated by a sulcus, somewhat more strongly marked than the rest and extending deeper into the substance of the cerebellum; they are the lobus superior anterior and lobus superior posterior. Upon the under portion of the hemisphere there are three such lobes, namely, lobusinferior anterior, medius, a,ndposterior, and two additional ones of peculiar form, the lobus inferior internus or tonsil, Siudthe flocculus. The tonsil (amygdala) is situated on the side of the vallecula, and projects into the fourth ventricle. The flocculus or pneumogastric lobule, long and slender, extends from the side of the vallecula around the corpus restiforme to the crus cerehelli, lying behind the filaments of the eighth pair of nerves. The commissure between the two hemispheres is termed the worm (vermis), that portion of the worm which occupies the upper surface of the cerebellum as far back as the horizontal fissure being the pro- cessus vermiformis superior, and that which is lodged within the vallecula being the processus vermiformis inferior. The superior vermiform process is a prominent longitudinal ridge, extending from the incisura anterior to the incisura posterior. In imitation of the hemispheres, it is divided into lobes, of which three have received names, namely, the lobulus centralis, a small lobe situated in the incisura anterior ; the monticulus cerebelli, a longer lobe, having its peak and declivity ; and a small lobe near the incisura posterior, the commissura simplex. The lobes of the inferior vermiform process are four in number, namely, the commissura brevis, situated in the incisura posterior, below the horizontal fissure; the pyramid, a small obtusely-pointed eminence ; a larger prominence, the uvula, situated between the tonsils, and connected with them by means of a commissure ; and in front of the uvula the nodulus. In front of the nodulus is a thin lamina of medullary substance con- sisting of a central and two lateral portions, the velum meduUare posterius (valvula Tarini), and between this velum and the nodulus and uvula is a deep fossa which is known as the swallow's nest (nidus hirundinis). The velum medullare anterius is the valve ofBASE OP THE BRAIN. 443 Vieussens, described with the fourth ventricle; both these vela proceed from the same point in the roof of that ventricle, and se- parate from each other at an angle, the one passing obliquely for- wards, the other obliquely backwards. When a vertical incision is made into the cerebellum, that appear- ance is seen which has been denominated arbor vitce cerebelli ; the white substance in the centre of such a section resembles the trunk of a tree, from which branches are given off, and from the branches branchlets and leaves, the two latter being coated by a moderately thick and uniform layer of grey substance. If the incision be made somewhat nearer the commissure than to the lateral border of the organ, a yellowish grey dentated line, enclosing medullary substance traversed by the openings of numerous vessels, will be seen in the centre of the white substance. This is the ganglion of the cerebellum, the corpus rhomboideum or dentatum, from which the peduncles of the cerebellum proceed. The grey line is dense and horny in structure, and is the cut edge of a thin capsule, open towards the medulla oblongata. The cerebellum is associated with the rest of the encephalon by means of three pairs of rounded cords or peduncles, superior, middle, and inferior. The superior peduncles, or processus e cerebello ad testes, proceed from the cerebellum forwards and upwards to the testes, in which they are lost. They form the anterior part of the lateral boundaries of the fourth ventricle, and give attachment by their inner borders to the valve of Vieussens, which is stretched between them. At their junction with the testes they are crossed by the fourth pair of nerves. The middle peduncles, or crura cerebelli ad pontem, the largest of the three, issue from the cerebellum through the anterior extremity of the sulcus horizontalis, and are lost in the pons Varolii. The inferior peduncles, or crura ad' medidlam ob- longatam, are the corpora restiformia which descend to the posterior part of the medulla oblongata, and form the inferior portion of the lateral boundaries of the fourth ventricle. BASE OP THE BRAIN. The student should now prepare to study the base of the brain : for this purpose the organ should be turned upon its incised surface; and if the dissection have hitherto been conducted with care, he will find the base uninjured. The arachnoid membrane, some parts of the pia mater, and the circle of Willis, must be carefully cleared away, in order to expose all the parts to be examined. These he will find arranged in the following order from before backwards: Longitudinal fissure. Commencement of the transverse fissure. Olfactory nerves. Optic commissure, Fissure of Sylvius, Tuber cinereum, Substantia perforata; Infundibulum ;444 BASE 01" THE BRAIN. Corpora albicantia, Locus perforatus, Crura cerebri; Pons Varolii, Crura cerebelli, Medulla oblongata. The Longitudinal fissure is the space separating the two hemi- spheres ; it is continued downwards to the base of the brain, and divides the two anterior lobes. In this fissure the anterior cerebral arteries ascend towards the corpus callosum; and, if the two lobes be slightly drawn asunder, the anterior border (genu) of the corpus cal- losum will be seen descending to the base of the brain. Arrived at the base of the brain, the corpus callosum terminates by a concave border, which is prolonged to the commissure of the optic nerves by a thin layer of grey substance, the lamina cinerea. The lamina cinerea is the anterior part of the inferior boundary of the third ventricle. On each side of the lamina cinerea the corpus callosum is continued into the substantia perforata and crura cerebri, and upon the latter forms a narrow medullary band lying externally to, and slightly over- lapping, the optic tract, the medulla innominata. Upon the under surface of each anterior lobe, on either side of the longitudinal fissure, is the olfactory nerve, with its bulb. The Fissure of Sylvius bounds the anterior lobe posteriorly, and separates it from the middle lobe; it lodges the middle cerebral artery. If this fissure be followed outwards, a small isolated cluster of five or six convolutions (gyri operti) will be observed; these constitute the island of Reil. The island of Reil, together with the substantia perforata, forms the base of the corpus striatum. The Substantia perforata (locus perforatus anticus) is a triangular plane of white substance, situated at the inner extremity of the fissure of Sylvius. It is named ])erforata from being pierced by a number of openings for small arteries, which enter the brain in this situation to supply the grey substance of the corpus striatum. Passing backwards on each side beneath the edge of the middle lobe, is the commencement oii^iQ great transverse fissure, which ex- tends beneath the hemisphere of one side to the same point on the opposite side. A probe passed into this fissure between the crus cerebri and middle lobe would enter the middle cornu of the lateral ventricle. The Optic commissure is situated on the middle line ; it is the point of communication between the two optic nerves. The Tuher cinereum is an eminence of grey substance situated im- mediately behind the optic commissure, and in front of the corpora albicantia. From its centre there projects a small conical body of grey substance, apparently a prolongation of the tuber cinereum, the infundihulum. The infundibulum is hollow, enclosing a short csecal canal, which communicates with the cavity of the third ven- tricle ; and below the termination of the canal, the conical process becomes connected with the pituitary gland. The infundibulum and tuber cinereum form part of the floor of the third ventricle.445 BASE OF THE BRAIN. The Pituitary gland (hypophysis cerebri) is a small, flattened, reddish-grey body, situated in the sella turcica, and closely retained in that situation by the dura mater and arachnoid. It consists of Fig. 161.* * Under surface or base of the brain. 1. Anterior lobe of one hemisphere of the cerebrum. 2. Middle lobe. 3.

Both lobes are connected with the infundibulnm, but the latter is so soft in texture as to be generally torn through in the removal of the brain. Indeed, for the purposes of the student, it is better to effect this separation with the knife, and leave the pituitary body in situ, to be exa- mined with the base of the cranium. The Corpora albicantia (mammillaria, pisiformia, bulbi fornicis) are two white convex bodies, having the shape and size of peas, situated behind the tuber cinereum, and between the crura cerebri. They are a part of the crura of the fornix, which, after their origin from the thalami optici, descend to the base of the brain, and making a sudden curve upon themselves previously to their ascent to the lateral ventricles, constitute the corpora albicantia. When divided by section, these bodies will be found to be composed of a capsule of white substance, containing grey matter, the grey matter of the two corpora being connected by means of a commissure. The Locus perforatus (posticus) is a layer of whitish-grey sub- stance, connected in front with the corpora albicantia, behind with the pons Varolii, and on each side with the crura cerebri, between which it is situated. It is perforated by several thick tufts of arte- ries, which are distributed to the thalami optici and third ventricle, of which latter it assists in forming the floor. It is also called the pons Tarini. The Crura cerebri (peduncles of the cerebrum) are two thick white cords, which issue from the anterior border of the pons Varolii, and diverge to enter the thalami optici. By their outer side the crura cerebri are continuous with the corpora quadrigemina, and, above, they constitute the lower boundary of the aqueduct of Sylvius. "Within, they contain grey matter, which has a semilunar shape when the crus is divided transversely, and has been termed the locus niger. The third nerve will be observed to arise from the inner side of each crus, and the fourth nerves wind around their outer border from above. The Pons Varolii* (protuberantia annularis, nodus encephali) is the broad transverse band of white fibres which arches like a bridge across the upper part of the medulla oblongata; and, contracting on each side into a thick rounded cord, enters the substance of the cere- bellum under the name of crus cerebelli. There is a groove along its middle which lodges the basilar artery. The pons Varolii is the com- missure of the cerebellum, and associates the two lateral lobes in their common function. Resting against the pons, near its posterior * Constant Varolius, Professor of Anatomy in Bologna: died in 1578. He dissected the brain in the course of its fibres, beginning from the medulla oblongata; a plan which has since been perfected by Vieussens, and by Gall and Spurzheim.

On the anterior border of the crus cerebelli, at each side, is the thick bundle of filaments belong- ing to the fifth nerve, and, lying against its posterior border, the seventh pair of nerves. The upper surface of the pons forms a part of the floor of the fourth ventricle. MEDULLA OBLONGATA. The medulla oblongata (bulbus rachidicus), is the upper enlarged portion of the spinal cord. It is somewhat conical in shape, and a little more than an inch in length, extending from the pons Varolii to a point corresponding with the upper border of the atlas. On the middle line in front and behind, the medulla oblongata is marked by- two vertical fissures, the anterior and posterior median fissures, which divide it superficially into two .symmetrical lateral cords or columns; whilst each lateral column is subdivided by minor grooves into three smaller cords, namely, the corpora pyramidalia, corpora olivaria, and corpora restiformia. The Corpora pyramidalia are two narrow convex cords, tapering slightly from above downwards, and situated one on either side of the anterior median fissure. At about an inch below the pons the corpora pyramidalia communicate very freely across the fissure by a decussation of their fibres, and at their point of entrance into the pons they are constricted into round cords. The fissure is somewhat enlarged by this constriction, and the enlarged space has received the name of foramen csecum (Vicq d'Azyr) of the medulla oblongata. The Corpora olivaria (named from some resemblance to the shape of an olive) are two oblong, oval-shaped, convex bodies, of about the same breadth with the corpora pyramidalia, about half-an-inch in length, and somewhat larger above than below. The corpus olivare is situated immediately external to the corpus pyramidale, from which, and from the corpus restiforme, it is separated by a well- marked groove. In this groove some longitudinal fibres are seen which enclose the base of the corpus olivare, and have been named funiculi siliquw, those which lie to its inner side being the funiculus internus, and those to its outer side the funiculus externus. Besides these there are other fibres which cross the corpus olivare obliquely, these are the Jibra; arciformes. When examined by section (fig. 163), the corpus olivare is found to be a ganglion deeply embedded in the medulla oblongata, and meeting its fellow at the middle line behind the corpus pyramidale. The ganglion of the corpus olivare (corpus dentatum, nucleus olivse), like that of the cerebellum, is a yellowish- grey dentated capsule, open behind, and containing medullary sub- stance from which a fasciculus of fibres proceeds upwards to the corpora quadrigemina and thalami optici. The nervous filaments which spring from the groove on the anterior border of the corpus448 FIBRES OF THE BRAIN. olivare, are those of the hypoglossal nerve; and those on its posterior border are the glosso-pharyngeal and pneumogastric. The Corpora restiformia (restis, a rope) comprehend the whole of the posterior half of each lateral column of the medulla oblongata. They are separated from the corpora olivaria by the grooves already spoken of; posteriorly they are divided from each other by the posterior median fissure and fourth ventricle, and superiorly they diverge and curve backwards to enter the cerebellum, and constitute its inferior peduncles. Along the posterior border of each corpus restiforme, and marked off from that body by a groove, is a narrow white cord, separated from its fellow by the posterior fissure. This pair of narrow cords are termed the j)OSterior pyramids (fasciculi graciles). Each fasciculus forms an enlargement (processus clavatus) at its upper end, and is then lost in the corresponding corpus resti- forme. The processus clavati are the lateral boundaries of the nib of the calamus scriptorius. The corpus restiforme is crossed near its entrance into the cerebellum by the auditory nerve, the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle, and the pneumogastric lobule. The remaining portion of the medulla oblongata visible from the exterior, are the two slightly convex columns which enter into the formation of the floor of the fourth ventricle. These columns are the fasciculi teretes (innominati). Diverging fibres.—The fibres composing the columns of the medulla oblongata have a special arrangement on reaching the upper part of that body, those of the corpora pyramidalia and olivaria enter the pons Varolii, and are thence prolonged through the crura cerebri, thalami optici, and corpora striata to the cerebral hemi- spheres ; but those of the corpora restiformia are reflected backwards into the cerebellum, and form its inferior peduncles. From pursuing this course, and spreading out as they advance, these fibres have been termed by Gall the diverging fibres. While situated within the pons the fibres of the corpus pyramidale and olivare separate and spread out, and have grey substance interposed between them; and they quit the pons much increased in number and bulk, so as to form the crus cerebri. The fibres of the cms cerebri again are separated in the thalamus opticus, and intermingled with grey matter, and they also quit that body greatly increased in number and bulk. Precisely the same change takes place in the corpus striatum, and the fibres are now so extraordinarily multiplied as to be capable of forming a large proportion of the hemispheres. Observing this remarkable increase in the white fibres, apparently from the admixture of grey substance, Gall and Spurzheim considered the latter as the material of increase or formative substance to the white fibres, and they are borne out in this conclusion by several collateral facts, among the most prominent of which is the great vascularity of the grey substance; the larger proportion of the nutrient fluid circulatiag through it is fully capable of effecting the increased growth and nutrition of the structures by which it is sur-FIBRES OF THE BRAIN. 449 rounded. For a like reason, the bodies in which this grey substance occurs, are called by the same physiologists ganglia of increase^'" and by other authors simply ganglia.

The fibres of the corpora pyramidalia are not all of them destined to the course above described; several fasciculi curve outwards to reach the corpora restiformia, some passing in front and'some behind the corpus olivare on each side. These are the arciform fibres; they are distinguished by Mr. Solly into the superficial and deep cerebellar fibres. In the pons Varolii the continued or cerebrai fibres (Solly) of the corpus pyramidale are placed between the superficial and deep layer of transverse fibres, and escaping from the pons, constitute the inferior and inner segment of the crus cerebri. From the crus cerebri they pass for the most part beneath the thalami optici into the corpora striata. The fibres which enclose the corpus olivare, under the name of fasciculi siliquse, are separated by that body into two bands; the innermost of the two bands, funiculus siliquce internus, accompanies the fibres of the corpus pyramidale into the crus cerebri. The funiculus siliquce externus unites with a fasciculus proceeding from the nucleus olivse, and the combined column ascending behind the crus cerebelli divides into a superior and an inferior band. The in- ferior band proceeds with a fasciculus presently to be described, the fasciculus innominatus, into the upper segment of the crus cerebri. The superior band (laqueus) ascends by the side of the processus e cerebello ad testes, and, crossing the latter obliquely, enters the corpora quadrigemina, in which many of its fibres are distributed, while the rest are continued onwards into the thalamus opticus. The corpora restiformia derive their fibres from the anterior as well as from the posterior columns of the medulla oblongata; they diverge as they approach the cerebellum, and leaving between them the cavity of the fourth ventricle, enter the substance of the cerebellum, under the form of two rounded cords. These cords envelop the corpora rhomboidea, or ganglia of increase, and then expand on all sides so as to constitute the cerebellum. Besides the fibres here described, there are, in the interior of the medulla oblongata, behind the corpora olivaria, and more or less apparent between these bodies and the corpora restiformia, two large bundles of fibres, the fasciculi innominati. These fasciculi ascend behind the deep transverse fibres of the pons Varolii, and become apparent in the floor of the fourth ventricle, under the name of fasciculi teretes. From this point they are prolonged upwards beneath the corpora quadrigemina into the crura cerebri, of which they form the upper and outer segment, and are thence continued through the thalami optici and corpora striata into the hemispheres. The locus niger of the crus cerebri is a septum of grey matter interposed between these fasciculi and those of the corpora pyramidalia. Converging fibres.—In addition to the diverging fibres which are thus shown to constitute both the cerebrum and cerebellum, by their increase and development, another set of fibres are found to451 SPINAL CORD. exist, which have for their office the association of the symmetrical halves and distant parts of the same hemispheres. These are called from their direction converging fibres, and from their office commissures. The commissures of the cerebrum and cerebellum are the— Corpus callosum, Middle commissure, Fornix, Posterior commissure. Septum lucidum, Peduncles of pineal gland, Anterior commissure, Pons Varolii. The Corpus callosum is the commissure of the hemispheres. It is therefore of moderate thickness in the middle, where its fibres pass directly from one hemisphere to the other; thicker in front (genu), where the anterior lobes are connected; and thickest behind (splenium), where the fibres from the posterior lobes are assembled. The fibres which curve backwards into the posterior lobes from the splenium of the corpus callosum have been termed forceps, those which pass directly outwards into the middle lobes from the same point, tapet^im, and those which curve forward and inwards from the genu to the anterior lobes, forceps anterior. The Fornix is an antero-posterior commissure, and serves to con- nect a number of parts. Below, it is associated with the tenia semi- circularis, thalami optici, and peduncles of the pineal gland; on each side, by means of the corpora fimbriata, mth the middle lobes of the brain; and, above, with the corpus callosum, and conse- quently with the hemispheres. The Septum lucidum is a perpendicular commissure between the fornix and corpus callosum. The Anterior commissure traverses the corpus striatum, and con- nects the anterior and middle lobes of opposite hemispheres. The Middle commissure is a layer of grey substance, uniting the thalami optici. The Posterior commissure is a white rounded cord, connect- ing the thalami optici. The Peduncles of the pineal gland must also be regarded as com- missures, assisted in their function by the grey substance of the gland. The Pons Varolii is the commissure to the two hemispheres of the cerebellum. It consists of transverse fibres, which are split into two layers by the passage of the fasciculi of the corpora pyramidalia and corpora olivaria. These two layers, superior and inferior, are collected together on each side, in the formation of the crura cerebelli. SPINAL CORD. The dissection of the spinal cord requires that the spinal column should be opened throughout its entire length by sawing through the laminse of the vertebrae, close to the roots of the transverse processes, and raising the arches with a chisel; the muscles of the back having been removed as a preliminary step. G G 2SPINAL CORD. 452 The Spinal column contains the spinal cord, or medulla spinalis; the roots of the spinal nerves; and the membranes of the cord, viz. the dura mater, arachnoid, pia mater, and membrana dentata. The Dura mater spinalis (theca vertebralis) is a cylindrical sheath of fibrous membrane, identical in structure with the dura mater of the skull, and continuous with that membrane. At the margin of the occipital foramen it is closely adherent to the bone; by its anterior surface it is attached to the posterior common liga- ment, and below, by means of its pointed extremity, to the coccyx. In the rest of its extent it is comparatively free, being connected, by a loose cellular tissue, to the walls of the spinal canal. In this cellular tissue there exists a quantity of reddish, oily, adipose sub- stance, somewhat analogous to the marrow of long bones. On either side and below, the dura mater forms a sheath for each of the spinal nerves, to which it is closely adherent. Upon its inner surface it is smooth, being lined by the arachnoid; and on its sides may be seen double openings for the two roots of each of the spinal nerves. The Arachnoid is a continuation of the serous membrane of the brain. It encloses the cord very loosely, being connected to it only by long slender filaments* of cellular tissue, and by a longitudinal lamella which is attached to the posterior aspect of the cord. The cellular tissue is most abundant in the cervical region, and diminishes in quantity from above downwards ; and the longitudinal lamella is complete only in the dorsal region. The arachnoid passes off from the cord on either side with the spinal nerves, to which it forms a sheath; and is then reflected on the dura mater, to constitute its serous surface. A connexion exists in several places between the arachnoid of the cord and that of the dura mater. The space between the arachnoid and the spinal cord is identical with that already described as existing between the same parts in the brain, the sub-arachnoidcan space. It is occupied by a serous fluid, sufii- cient in quantity to expand the arachnoid, and fill completely the cavity of the theca vertebralis. The siib-arachnoidean or cerebro- spinal fluid keeps up a constant and gentle pressure on the entire surface of the brain and spinal cord, and yields with the greatest facility to the various movements of the cord, giving to those delicate structures the advantage of the principles so usefully applied by Dr. Arnott in the hydrostatic bed. The Pia mater is the immediate investment of the cord; and, like the other membranes, is continuous with that of the brain. It is not, however, like the pia mater cerebri, a vascular membrane; but is dense and fibrous in structure, and contains but few vessels. It invests the cord closely, and sends a duplicature into the anterior median fissure, and another, extremely delicate, into the posterior * According to Mr. Eainey these filaments are nervous fasciculi having their origin in the arachnoid, and passing to the arteries of the cord. See page 428.453 SPINAL CORD. median fissure. It forms a sheath for each of the filaments of the nerves, and for the nerves themselves; and, inferiorly, at the conical termination of the cord, is prolonged downwards as a slender ligament {filum terminale), which descends through the centre of the cauda equina, and is attached to the dura mater lining the canal of the coccyx. This attachment is a rudiment of the original extension of the spinal cord into the canal of the sacrum and coccyx. The pia mater has, distributed to it, a number of nervous plexuses derived from the sympathetic. The Memhrana dentata (ligamentum dentatum) is a thin process of pia mater sent oif from each side of the cord throughout its entire length, and separating the anterior from the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. The number of serrations on each side is about twenty, the first being situated on a level with the occipital foramen, and having the vertebral artery and hypoglossal nerve passing in front and the spinal accessory nerve behind it, and the last opposite the first or second lumbar vertebra. Below this point, the membrana dentata is lost in the filum terminale of the pia mater. The use of this membrane is to maintain the position of the spinal cord in the midst of the fluid by which it is surrounded. The Spinal cord of the adult, somewhat less than eighteen inches in length, extends from the pons Varolii to opposite the first or second lumbar vertebra, where it terminates in a rounded point; in the child, at birth, it reaches to the middle of the third lumbar vertebra, and in the embryo is prolonged as far as the coccyx. It presents a difference of diameter in different parts of its extent, and has three enlargements. The uppermost of these is the medulla oblongata; the next corresponds with the origin of the nerves destined to the upper extremities (brachial); and the lower enlarge- ment (lumbar) is situated near its termination, and corresponds with the attachment of the nerves which are intended for the supply of the lower limbs. The brachial enlaigement is flattened from before backwards, and extends from the third cervical vertebra to the first dorsal; the lumbar enlargement is flattened from side to side, and is smaller than the brachial. The spinal cord gives off near its ter- mination that assemblage of nerves which has received the name of Cauda equina. In form, the spinal cord is a flattened cylinder, and presents on its anterior surface a fissure, which extends into the cord to the depth of one-third of its diameter. This is the anterior median fissure. If the sides of the fissure be gently separated, they will be seen to be connected at the bottom by a layer of medullary substance, the anterior white commissure. On the posterior surface another fissure exists, which is so narrow between the second cervical and second lumbar nerve, as to be hardly perceptible. This is the posterior median fissure. It extends more deeply into the cord than the anterior fissure, and terminates in the454 SPINAL CORD. grey substance of the interior.* These two fissures divide the me- dulla spinalis into two lateral cords, which are connected to each other by the white commissure which forms the bottom of the an- terior fissure, and by a commissure of grey matter situated behind the former. On either side of the posterior median fissure is a slight line which bounds on each side the posterior median columns. These columns are most apparent at the upper part of the cord, in the medulla oblongata, where they have received the name of pos- terior pyramids. Two other lines are observed on the medulla, the anterior and posterior lateral sulci, corresponding with the attachment of the an- terior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves. The anterior lateral sulcus is a mere trace, marked only by the attachment of the fila- ments of the anterior roots. The posterior lateral sulcus is more evident, and is a narrow greyish line, derived from the grey sub- stance of the interior. Although these fissures and sulci indicate a division of the spinal cord into three pairs of columns, namely, anterior, lateral, and pos- terior, the posterior median columns being regarded as part of the posterior columns, it is customary to consider each half of the spinal cord as consisting of two columns only, antero-lateral and posterior. The antero-lateral columns are the columns of motion, and compre- hend all that part of the cord situated between the anterior median * According to some anatomists there exists a posterior white commissure at the bottom of the posterior median fissure.

If a transverse section of the spinal cord be made, its internal structure may be seen and examined. It will then appear to be composed of two hollow cylinders of white matter, placed side by side, and connected by a narrow lohite commissure. Each cylinder is filled with grey substance, which is connected by a commissure of the same matter {grey commissure). The form of the grey substance, as observed in the section, is that of two irregularly curved or cre- scentic lines joined by a transverse band. The extremities of the curved lines correspond with the sulci of origin of the anterior and posterior roots of the nerves. The anterior extremities, larger than the posterior, do not quite reach the surface; but the posterior ap- pear upon the surface, and form a narrow grey line, the sulcus late- ralis posterior. The white substance of the spinal cord is composed of parallel fibres, which are collected into longitudinal laminse and extend throughout the entire length of the cord. These laminse are various .in breadth, and are arranged in a radiated manner; one border being thick and corresponding with the surface of the cord, while the other is thin and lies in contact with the grey substance of the interior. According to Rolando the white substance constitutes a simple nervous membrane, folded into longitudinal plaits, which have the radiated disposition above described. The anterior com- missure, according to his description, is merely the continuation of this nervous membrane from one lateral cord across the middle line to the other. Moreover, Rolando considers that a thin lamina of pia mater is received between each of the folds from the exterior, while a layer of grey substance is prolonged between them from within. Cruveilhier is of opinion that each lamella is completely independent of its neighbours, and he believes this statement to be confirmed by pathology, ,which shows that a single lamella may be injured or atrophied, and at the same time be surrounded by others perfectly sound. CRANIAL NERVES. There are nine pairs of cranial nerves; which, taken in their order from before backwards, are as follow: 1st. Olfactory. 2nd. Optic. 3rd. Motores oculorum. 4th. Pathetic!

Pneumogastric (vagus, par vagum). Spinal accessory. Hypoglossal (lingual). Functionally or physiologically the cranial nerves admit of division into three groups, namely, nerves of special sense, nerves of motion, and compound nerves, that is, nerves which contain fibres both of sensation and motion. The nerves belonging to these groups are the following: Special sense Motion Compound 1st. Olfactory. 2nd. Optic. 7th. Auditory. 3rd. Motores oculorum. 4 th. Pathetici. 6th. Abducentes. 7th. Facial. 9th. Hypoglossal. 5th. Trifacial. 8th. Glosso-pharyngeal. ,, Pn eumogastric. ,, Spinal accessory. The fourth, facial and eighth nerves were considered by Sir Charles Bell to form a system apart from the rest, and to be allied in the functions of expression and respiration. In consonance with this view he termed them respiratory nerves, and he gave to that part of the medulla oblongata from which they arise the name of respiratory tract. First pair. Olfactory.—The olfactory nerve arises by three roots; an inner root from the inner and posterior part of the anterior lobe close to the substantia perforata, a middle root from a papilla of grey matter (caruncula mamillaris), embedded in the anterior lobe, and an external root, which may be traced as a white streak along the fissure of Sylvius into the corpus striatum, where it is continuous with some of the fibres of the anterior commissure. The nervous cord formed by the union of the three roots is soft in texture, prismcid in shape, and embedded in a sulcus between two convolu- tions on the under surface of each anterior lobe of the brain, lying between the pia mater and the arachnoid. As it passes forward it increases in breadth and swells at its extremity into an oblong mass of grey and white substance, the bulbus olfactorius, which rests upon the cribriform lamella of the ethmoid bone. From the under surface of the bulbus olfactorius are given off the nerves which pass through the cribriform foramina, and supply the mucous membraneOPTIC NERVE. 457 of the nares; they are arranged into three groups, an inner group, reddish in colour and soft, which spread out upon the septum narium; an outer- group, whiter and more firm, which descend through bony canals in the outer wall of the nares, and are dis- tributed on the superior and middle turbinated bones; and a middle group, which supply the mucous membrane of the roof of the nasal fossae.

Proceeding from this origin it winds around the crus cerebri as a flattened band, under the name of tractus opticus, and joins with its fellow in front of the tuber cinereum to form the optic commissure (chiasma). The tractus opticus is united with the crus cerebri and tuber cinereum, and is covered in by the pia mater; the commissure is also connected with the tuber cinereum, from which it receives fibres, and the nerve beyond the commissure diverges from its fellow, becomes rounded in form, and is enclosed in a sheath derived from the arachnoid. In passing through the optic foramen the optic nerve receives a sheath from the dura mater, which splits at this point into two layers; one, which becomes the periosteum of the orbit; the other, the one in question, which forms a sheath for the nerve, and is lost in the sclerotic coat of the eyeball. After a short course within the orbit the optic nerve pierces the sclerotic and choroid coats and expands into the nervous membrane of the eyeball, the retina. Near the globe, the nerve is pierced by a small artery, the arteria centralis retinae, which runs through the central axis of the nerve and reaches the internal surface of the retina, to which it distributes branches. The commissure rests upon the processus olivaris of the sphenoid bone; it is bounded by the lamina cinerea of the corpus callosum in front, by the substantia perforata on each side, and by the tuber cinereum behind. Within the commissure the innermost fibres of the optic nerves cross each other to pass to opposite eyes, while the outer fibres continue their course uninterruptedly to the eye of the corresponding side. The neurilemma of the commissure, as well as that of the nerves, is formed by the pia mater. Third pair. Motores Oculorum.—The motor oculi, a nerve of moderate size, arises from the inner side of the crus cerebri, close to the pons Varolii, and passes forward between the posterior cere- bral and superior cerebellar artery. It pierces the dura mater im- mediately in front of the posterior clinoid process; descends obliquely along the external wall of the cavernous sinus; and divides into two branches which enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure and between the two heads of the external rectus muscle. The superior branch ascends, and supplies the superior rectus and levator palpe- brse. The inferior sends a branch beiieath the optic nerve to the internal rectus, another to the inferior rectus, and a long branch to the inferior oblique muscle. From the latter a short thick branch is given to the ophthalmic ganglion, forming its inferior root. The branches of the third nerve enter the muscles on their ocular side. The fibres of origin of this nerve may be traced into the grey sub- stance of the crus cerebri,* into the motor tract,f and as far as the corpora quadrigemina and valve of Yieussens. In the cavernous sinus it receives one or two filaments from the carotid plexus, and one from the ophthalmic nerve. * Mayo. t SoUy.459 FOURTH PAIR—PATHETICI. 'Fourth pair.

In its course through the sinus it is situated at first below the motor oculi, but afterwards ascends and becomes the highest of the nerves which enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure. Upon entering the orbit the nerve crosses the levator palpebrse muscle near its origin, and is distributed upon the orbital surface of the superior oblique or trochlearis muscle ; hence its synonym trochlearis. Branches.—While in the cavernous sinus the fourth nerve gives off a recurrent branch, and sends a branch of communication to the ophthalmic nerve; the recurrent branch, which consists of sympa- thetic filaments derived from the carotid plexus, passes backwards between the layers of the tentorium, and divides into two or three filaments, which are distributed to the lining membrane of the lateral sinus. This recurrent nerve is sometimes a branch of the ophthalmic, and occasionally proceeds directly from the carotid plexus. Sometimes the communication with the ophthalmic takes place in the orbit, in which case the lachrymal nerve has the appear- ance of arising by two roots. Fifth Pair. Trifacial (trigeminus.) — The fifth nerve, the great sensitive nerve of the head and face, and the largest cranial nerve, is analogous to the spinal nerves in its origin by two roots from the anterior and posterior columns of the spinal cord, and in the existence of a ganglion on the posterior root. It arises from a tract of yellowish-white matter situated in front of the floor of the fourth ventricle and origin of the auditory nerve, and behind the crus cerebelli. This tract divides inferiorly into two fasciculi which may be traced downwards into the spinal cord, one being continuous with the fibres of the anterior column, the other with the posterior column. Proceeding from this origin the two roots of the nerve pass forward, and issue from the brain upon the anterior part of the crus cerebelli, where they are separated by a slight interval. The anterior is much smaller than the posterior, and the two toge- ther constitute the fifth nerve, which, in this situation, consists of seventy to a hundred filaments held together by pia mater and en- closed in a sheath of the arachnoid membrane. The nerve then passes through an oval opening in the border of the tentorium, near the extremity of the petrous bone, and spreads out into a large semi- lunar ganglion, the Casserian. If the ganglion be turned over, it will be seen that the anterior root lies against its under surface with- out having any connexion with it, and may be followed onwards to the inferior maxillary nerve. The Casserian ganglion divides into three branches, the ophthalmic, superior maxillary, and inferior maxillary. * I have adopted the origin of this nerve, given by Dr. Alcock, of Dublin, in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology, as the result of his dissec- tions. Mr. Mayo also traces the anterior root of the nerve to a similar origin.FIFTH PAIK—TRIFACIAL. 461 * Cerebral nerves within the cranium. 1.

The Ophthalmic nerve is the nerve of sensation of the eyeball, lachrymal gland, mucous membrane of the eye and nose, integument of the forehead and nose, and muscles of the eyebrow and forehead. It arises from the upper part of the Casserian ganglion by a short trunk, about three quarters of an inch in length; passes forwards through the outer wall of the cavernous ^inus, lying externally to the other nerves, and divides into three branches. Previously to its division it receives several filaments from the carotid plexus, and gives off a small recurrent nerve, that passes backwards with the recurrent branch of the fourth nerve between the two layers of the tentorium to the lining membrane of the lateral sinus. The Branches of the ophthalmic nerve are, the— Frontal, Lachrymal, Nasal. The Frontal nerve enters the orbit immediately to the outer side of the fourth nerve, and passing forwards, for some distance, upon the levator palpebrse muscle, divides into a supra-orbital and supra- trochlear branch. The supra-orl>ital branch, the proper continuation of the nerve, passes out of the orbit through the supra-orbital notch, in company with the supra-orbital artery, and after giving filaments to the upper eyelid, muscles of the forehead and pericranium, divides into two cutaneous branches internal and external. The internal hranch pierces the occipito-frontalis and is distributed to the integument as far as the summit of the head. The external branch of larger size communicates with the facial nerve, and piercing the occipito-frontalis supplies the integument as far back as the occiput. The supra-trochlear branch passes inwards to the angle of the orbit, above the pulley of the superior oblique muscle, and is distri- buted to the inner angle of the eye, the root of the nose, and the integument of the middle line of the forehead. It communicates with the infra-trochlear branch of the nasal nerve. The Lachrymal nerve, the smallest of the three branches of the ophthalmic, enters the orbit on the outer side of the frontal, but enclosed in a separate sheath of dura mater ; and passes forwards, above the upper border of the external rectus muscle, and in com- pany with the lachrymal artery to the lachrymal gland, where it divides into two branches, superior and inferior. The superior branch passes over the gland which it supplies on the upper surface, and traversing a foramen in the malar bone, communicates with the gubcutaneus mal^ and facial nerve. The inferior branch sup- plies the under surface of the gland, the upper lid and outer angle of the eye. The lachrymal nerve sometimes receives the branch of the fourth nerve passing through the foramen ovale. 19.

The Branches of the nasal nerve are the ganglionic, ciliary, and infra-trochlear. The ga/nglimvic hranch, about half an inch in length and of small size, enters the upper angle of the ophthalmic ganglion, and consti- tutes its superior or long root. The long ciliary branches are two or three filaments given o& from the nerve as it crosses the optic nerve. They pierce the sclerotic coat near the short ciliary nerves, and passing through the globe of the eye between the sclerotic and choroid, are distributed to the iris. The infra-trochlear branch is given off close to the anterior eth- moidal foramen. It passes forwards along the upper border of the internal rectus to the inner angle of the eye, where it communicates with the supra-trochlear nerve, and is distributed to the lachrymal sac and inner angle of the orbit. The Superior maxillary nerve, larger than the preceding, is the nerve of sensation of the teeth of the upper jaw, the hard and so^t palate, tonsils, antrum maxillare, and muscles and integument of' the lower eyelid, cheek, and upper lip. Proceeding from the middle of the Casserian ganglion, it passes forward through the foramen rotundum, crosses the spheno-maxillary fossa, and enters the canal in the floor of the orbit, along which it runs to the infra- orbital foramen. Emerging on the face, beneath the levator labii superioris muscle, it divides into a number of branches, which form a plexus with the facial nerve. The Branches of the superior maxillary nerve are divisible into three groups : namely, those given off in the spheno-maxillary fossa ; those given off in the infra-orbital canal; and those given off on the face. They may be thus arranged : The Orbital or temporo-malar branch enters the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure, and divides into two branches, tem- poral and malar ; the temporal branch ascends along the outer wall of the orbit, and after receiving a branch from the lachrymal nerve, passes through a canal in the malar bone, and enters the temporal fossa; it then pierces the temporal muscle and fascia, and is distri- buted to the integument of the temple and side of the forehead, communicating with the facial and anterior temporal nerve.

H HINFERIOK MAXILLARY NERVE. 466 temporal fossa it comnninicates with tlie deep temporal nerves. The malar, or inferior branch (subcutaneus malse) takes its course along the lower angle of the outer wall of the orbit, and emerges upon the cheek through an opening in the malar bone, passing between the fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle. It communicates with branches of the infra-orbital and facial nerve. The Spheno-palatine branches, two in number, pass downwards to the spheno-palatine or Meckel's ganglion. The Posterior dental hranclies, two in number, pass downwards upon the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, where one enters a canal in the bone, and is distributed to the molar teeth and lining membrane of the antrum, and communicates with the anterior dental nerve; while the other, lying externally to the bone, is distributed to the gums and buccinator muscle. The Middle and anterior dental branches descend to the corre- sponding teeth and gums; the former beneath the lining membrane of the antrum, the latter through distinct canals in the walls of the bone. Previously to their distribution, the dental nerves form a plexus (superior maxillary plexus) in the outer wall of the superior maxillary bone immediately above the alveolus. From this plexus the filaments are given off which supply the pulps of the teeth, gums, mucous membrane of the floor of the nares, and palate. Some gangliform bodies have been described in connexion with this jDlexus, one being placed over the canine, and another over the second molar tooth. The Muscular and cutaneous branches are the terminating fila- ments of the nerve; they supply the muscles, integument, and mucous membrane of the lower eyelid, cheek, nose, and lip, and form a plexus by their communications with the facial nerve. The Inferior maxillary nerve is a nerve both of sensation and motion, and is distributed to the teeth and gums of the lower jaw, the tongue, which it supplies with the sense of taste, the in- tegument of the temple, external ear, lower part of the face and lower lip, and the muscles of mastication. It proceeds from the inferior angle of the Casserian ganglion, is the largest of the three divisions of the fifth nerve, and is increased in size by the anterior or motor root, which passes behind the ganglion, and unites with the inferior maxillary as it escapes through the foramen ovale. Emerging at the foramen ovale the nerve divides into two trunks, external and internal, which are separated from each other by the external pteiygoid muscle. The External division, into which may be traced nearly the whole of the motor root, immediately separates into five or six branches, which are distributed to the muscles of the temporo-maxillary region; they are, the masseteric, temporal, buccal, internal pterygoid, and external pterygoid. The Masseteric branch passing over the external pterygoid muscle,AURICULO-TEMPORAL NERVE. 467 and behind tlie tendon of the temporal, crosses the sigmoid notch with the masseteric artery to the masseter muscle. It sends a small branch to the temporal muscle, and a filament to the tempore- maxillary articulation. The Deep temporal branches, two in number, anterior and pos- terior, pass between the upper border of the external pterygoid muscle and the temporal bone to the temporal muscle. Two or three filaments from these nerves pierce the temporal fascia, and communi- cate with the lachrymal, subcutaneus malag, superficial temporal, and facial nerve. The Buccal branch is of large size, and pierces the lower fibres of the external pterygoid muscle at its anterior part. It sends a branch to the external pterygoid muscle, and is distributed to the bucci- nator, and to the mucous membrane and integument of the cheek, communicating with the facial nerve. The Internal pterygoid branch is a long and slender nerve which passes inwards to the internal pterygoid muscle, and gives filaments in its course to the tensor palati and tensor tympani. This nerve is remarkable from its connexion with the otic ganglion, to which it is closely attached. The External pterygoid branch is commonly derived from the bi^ccal nerve. 'The Internal division of the inferior maxillary nerve splits into three branches— Auriculo-temporal, Inferior dental, Gustatory. The Auriculo-temporal nerve originates by two roots, between which the arteria meningea media takes its course, and passes di- rectly backwards behind the articulation of the lower jaw. It then ascends between that articulation and the meatus auris, and, escaping from beneath the parotid gland, divides into two temporal branches. While behind the tempore-maxillary articulation, it forms a kind of plexus, and sends off several branches. Its branches are, a small branch to the temporo-maxillary articu- lation ; two or three to the parotid gland; two to the meatus auris, which enter the canal between the fibre-cartilage and the processus auditorius; two auricular branches to the pinna; a communicating branch to the otic ganglion; two communicating branches to the facial nerve, and the temporal branches. The auricular branches, superior and inferior, are distributed to the pinna above and below the meatus. The inferior branch com- municates with the sympathetic. The branches which communicate with the facial nerve embrace the external carotid artery in their course. The temporal branches are anterior and posterior; the anterior accompanies the temporal artery, and supplies the integument of the temporal region, communicating with the branches of the facial, H H 2GUSTATORY NERVE. 468 supra-orbital, subcutaneus malse and lacbrymal nerve; tlie posterior is distributed to the upper part of the pinna, the attrahens aurem muscle, and the integument of the posterior part of the temple. The Inferior dental nerve, the largest of the three branches of the internal division of the inferior maxillary, passes downwards with the inferior dental artery, at first between the two pterygoid muscles, and then between the internal lateral ligament and the ramus of the lower jaw, to the dental foramen. It then runs along the canal in the inferior maxillary bone, distributing branches (in- ferior maxillary plexus) to the teeth and gums, and divides into two terminal branches, incisive and mental. The Branches of the inferior dental nerve, besides those given to the teeth, are the mylo-hyoidean and the two terminal branches. The Mylo-hyoidean branch leaves the nerve just as it is about to enter the dental foramen; it then pierces the insertion of the in- ternal lateral ligament, and descends along a groove in the bone to the inferior surface of the mylo-hyoid muscle, to which, and to the anterior belly of the digastricus, it is distributed. The Incisive branch is continued forward to the symphysis of the jaw, to supply the incisor teeth. The Mental or labial branch emerges from the jaw at the mental foramen, beneath the depressor anguli oris, and divides into branches which supply the muscles and integument of the lower lip and chin, and communicate with the facial nerve. The GrusTATORT nerve descends between the two pterygoid muscles, and makes a gentle curve forwards to the side of the tongue, along which it takes its course to the tip. On the side of the tongue it is flattened, and gives off numerous branches, which are distributed to the mucous membrane and papillae. In the upper part of its course the gustatory nerve lies between the external pterygoid muscle and the pharynx, next between the two pterygoid muscles, then between the internal pterygoid and ramus of the jaw, and between the stylo-glossus muscle and the submaxillary gland ; lastly, it runs along the side of the tongue, resting against the byo-glossus muscle, and crossing the dnct of the submaxillary gland, and is covered in by the mylo-hyoideus and mucous membrane. The gustatory nerve, while between the pterygoid muscles, often ' receives a communicating branch from the inferior dental; lower down it is joined at an acute angle by the chorda tympani, a small nerve which, arising from the facial in the aqueductus Fallopii, crosses the tympanum, and escapes from that cavity through the fissura Griaseri. Having joined the gustatory nerve, the chorda tympani is continued downwards in its sheath to the submaxillary ganglion. One or two branches are given by the gustatory nerve to the sub- maxillary ganglion.469 ABDUCENTES.—FACIAL NERVE. On the hyo-glossTis muscle several branches of comnninication join with brandies of the hypoglossal nerve, and others are sent to the sublingual gland, Wharton's duct, and mucous membrane of the mouth and gums. Sixth pair, abducentes.—The abducens nerve, about half the size of the motor oculi, arises by several filaments from the upper constricted part of the corpus pyramidale, close to the pons Varolii. Proceeding forwards from this origin, it lies parallel with the basilar artery, and, piercing the dura mater upon the clivus Blumenbachii of the sphenoid bone, ascends beneath that membrane to the cavernous sinus. It then runs forward in the outer wall of the sinus below the level of the other nerves, and, resting against the internal carotid artery, to the sphenoidal fissure. Entering the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure it passes between the two heads of the external rectus, and is distributed to that muscle. At the sphenoidal fissure it lies upon the ophthalmic vein, from which it is separated by a lamina of dura mater; and in the cavernous sinus it is joined by several filaments from the carotid plexus. Mr. Mayo traced the origin of this nerve between the fasciculi of the corpora pyramidalia to the posterior part of the medulla ob- longata ; and Mr. Grainger pointed out its connexion with the grey substance of the spinal cord. Seventh pair.—The seventh pair consists of two nerves* which lie side by side on the posterior border of the crus cerebelli. The smaller and most internal of these, and at the same time the most dense in texture, is the facial nerve or portio dura. The external nerve, which is s^t and pulpy, and often grooved by contact with the preceding, is the auditory nerve or portio mollis of the seventh pair. Soemmering makes the auditory nerve the eighth pair; but, retaining the classification of Willis, we regard it as a part of the seventh. Facial nerve (portio dura).—The facial nerve, the motor nerve of the face, arises from the upper part of the groove between the corpus olivare and corpus restiforme close to the pons Varolii, from which point its fibres may be traced deeply into the corpus restiforme. The nerve then passes forward, resting on the crus cerebelli, and comes into relation with the auditory nerve, with which it enters the meatus auditorius internus, lying at first to the inner side of, and * A third nerve of small size, the portio intermedia of Wrisberg, is brought into view by separating these two trunks. The researches of Dr. Morganti go to show that the portio intermedia is connected, at its origin in the corpus restiforme, with the auditory nerve; that it is the posterior or sensitive root of the facial; that the mtumescentia gangliformis of the facial is the - ganglion of this root; that it bestows the principal part of the sensitive func- tion on the facial; and that the chorda tympani is partly derived from the intumescentia gangliformis.FACIAL NERVE. 470 then upon that nerve. At the bottom of the meatus it enters the aqueductus Fallopii, and takes its course forwards to the hiatus Fallopii, in the anterior wall of the petrous bone, where it forms a gangliform swelling (intumescentia gangliformis, ganglion geniculare), and receives the petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve. It then curves backwards towards the tympanum, and descends in the inner wall of that cavity to the stylo-mastoid foramen. Emerging at the stylo- mastoid foramen, it passes forwards within the parotid gland, cross- ing the external carotid artery, to the ramus of the lower jaw, where it divides into two trunks, temporo-facial and cervico-facial. These trunks divide into numerous branches, which escape from the an- terior border of the parotid gland, and are distributed in a radiated manner over the side of the face, from the temple to below the lower jaw; on the masseter muscle the branches communicate and form loops, and the whole arrangement over the side of the face has been termed %:>es anserinus. In the meatus auditorius, the facial nerve communicates with the auditory nerve by one or two filaments; the intumescentia gangli- formis receives the nervus petrosus superficialis major and minor, and sends a twig back to the auditory nerve; behind the tympanum the nerve receives one or two twigs from the auricular branch of the pneumogastric; at its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen it re- ceives a twig from the glosso-pharyngeal, and in the parotid gland one or two large branches from the auriculo-temporal nerve. Besides these, the facial nerve has numerous peripheral communications, with the branches of the fifth nerve on the face, with the cervical nerves in the parotid gland and on the neck, and with the sympa- thetic. The numerous communications of the faisial nerve have ob- tained for it the designation of nervus sympatheticus minor. The Branches of the facial nerve are— The Tympanic branch is a small filament given off by the facial while in the petrous bone, and distributed to the stapedius muscle. The Chorda tympani quits the facial immediately above the stylo-mastoid foramen, and ascends by a distinct canal to the upper part of the posterior wall of the tympanum, where it enters that cavity through an opening situated between the base of the pyramid and the attachment of the membrana tympani, and becomes invested by mucous membrane.

Enclosed in the sheath of the gustatory nerve, it descends to the submaxillary gland, where it unites with the submaxillary ganglion. The Posterior moricular branch ascends behind the ear, between the meatus and mastoid process, and divides into an anterior or auricular, and a posterior or occipital, branch. The auricular branch receives a filament of communication from the auricular branch of the pneumogastric nerve, and distributes filaments to the retrahens aurem muscle and pinna. The occipital branch communi- cates with the auricularis magnus and occipitalis minor, and is dis- tributed to the posterior belly of the occipito-frontalis. The Stylo-hyoid branch is distributed to the stylo-hyoid muscle, and communicates with the sympathetic plexus of the external carotid artery. The Digastric branch supplies the posterior belly of the digastricus muscle, and communicates with the glosso-pharyngeal and pneumo- gastric nerve. The Temporo-facial division, while in the parotid gland, sends a branch of communication along the carotid artery to the auriculo- temporal nerve, and divides into temporal, malar, and infra-orbital branches. The Temporal branches Sbscending over the temporal region supply the attrahens aurem, occipito-frontalis, and orbicularis palpebrarum; and communicate with the supra-orbital nerve and the temporal branch of the superior maxillary. The Malar branches cross the malar bone to the outer angle of the eye, and supply the orbicularis palpebrarum, corrugator supercilii, and eyelids. They communicate with the subcutaneus malse branch of the superior maxillary nerve, and with branches of the ophthalmic nerve in the eyelids. The Infra-orbital hramches cross the masseter muscle, and are distributed to the buccinator, elevator muscles of the upper lip and. orbicularis oris. They communicate with the terminal branches of the infra-orbital nerve, the infra-trochlear, and nasal nerve. Two or more of these branches are found by the side of Stenon's duct. The Cervico-facial division, smaller than the temporo-facial, communicates in the parotid gland with the auricularis magnus nerve, and divides into branches which admit of arrangement into three sets : buccal, supra-maxillary, and infra-maxillary. The Buccal branches pass forwards across the masseter muscle towards the mouth, and distribute branches to the orbicularis oris and buccinator. They communicate with the branches of the tem- poro-facial, and with the buccal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. The Supra-maxillary branches are destined to the muscles of the lower lip, and take their course along the body of the lower jaw.FACIAL NERVE, 472 They have a plexiform commumcation with the inferior dental nerve beneath the depressor anguli oris. The Infra-maxillary branches (subcntanei colli) take their course below the lower jaw, pierce the deep cervical fascia, and are dis- tributed to the platysma. They communicate with the superficialis colli nerve. Fig. 169.* * Distribution of the facial nerve and branches of the cervical plexus. 1.

It then passes forward on the crus cerebelli in com- pany with the facial nerve, which lies in a groove on its superior surface, enters the meatus auditorius internus, and at the bottom of the meatus divides into two branches, cochlear and vestibular. The auditory nerve is soft and pulpy in texture, and receives in the meatus auditorius several filaments from the facial nerve. Eighth pair.—The eighth pair consists of three nerves, glosso- pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory; these are the ninth, tenth, and eleventh pairs of Soemmering. Glosso-pharyngeal nerve.—The glosso-pharyngeal nerve, as its name implies, is the nerve of sensation of the mucous membrane of the tongue and pharynx, but it also gives branches to some of the muscles of these organs. It arises by five or six filaments from the groove between the corpus olivare and restiforme, or rather from the anterior border of the latter, and escapes from the skull at the innermost extremity of the jugular foramen through a distinct opening in the dura mater, lying anteriorly to the sheath of the prteumogastric and spinal accessory nerve, and internally to the jugular vein. It then passes forward between the jugular vein and internal carotid artery, and crosses the artery to reach the poste- rior border of the stylo-pharyngeus. Following the posterior border of this muscle for a short distance, it next passes across it and the middle constrictor and behind the hyo-glossus muscle, to be distributed to the mucous membrane of the tongue and pharynx and to the tonsUs. While in the jugular fossa, the nerve presents two gangliform swellings ; one superior, the ganglion jugulare (Miiller), of small size, and involving only the posterior fibres of the nerve ; the other inferior, nearly half an inch below the preceding, of larger size, and occupying the whole diameter of the nerve, the ganglion petrosum or ganglion of Andersch. * The fibres of origin of this nerve may be traced through the fasciculi of the corpus restiforme to the grey substance in the floor of the fourth ventricle. The Branches of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve are branches of communication and branches of distribution. The Branches of communication proceed chiefly from the gang- lion of Andersch ; they are, one to join the auricular branch of the pneumogastric ; one to the ganglion of the pneumogastric ; one to the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic ; and one, which * Charles Samuel Andersch. " Traetatus Anatomico-Physiologicus de Nervis corporis Humani AJiquibus, 1797."474 PNEUMOGASTRIC NEKVE. arises below tlie ganglion and pierces the posterior belly of the digastricus muscle, to join the facial nerve. The Branches of distribution are The Tympanic branch (Jacobson's nerve) proceeds from the ganglion of Andersch, or from the trunk of the nerve immediately above the ganglion; it enters a small bony canal in the jugular fossa (page 35), and divides into six branches, which are distri- buted upon the inner wall of the tympanum, and establish a plexiform communication (tympanic plexus) with the sympathetic and fifth pair of nerves. The branches of distribution supply the fenestra rotunda, fenestra ovalis, and Eustachian tube : those of communication join the carotid plexus in the carotid canal, the petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve, and the otic ganglion. The Carotid branches are several filaments which follow the trunk of the internal carotid artery, and communicate with the nervi molles of the sympathetic. The Muscular branch divides into filaments, which are distri- buted to the posterior belly of the digastricus, stylo-hyoideus, stylo- pharyngeus, and constrictor muscles. The Pharyngeal branches are two or three filaments which are distributed to the pharynx and unite with the pharyngeal branches of the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerve to form the pharyngeal plexus. The Tonsillitic branches proceed from the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, near its termination ; they form a plexus (circulus tonsil- laris) around the base of the tonsil, from which numerous filaments are given off to the mucous membrane of the fauces and soft palate. These filaments communicate with the descending palatine branches of Meckel's ganglion. The Lingual branches enter the substance of the tongue beneath the hyo-glossus and stylo-glossus muscle, and are distributed to the mucous membrane of the side and base of the tongue, and to the epiglottis and fauces. Pneumogastric or Vagus nerve (par vagum).—The pneumo- gastric is the nerve of the respiratory organs and upper part of the alimentary canal, supplying branches to the larynx, trachea, lungs, pharynx, oesophagus, and stomach, and also giving branches to the heart. It arises by ten or fifteen filaments from the groove be- tween the corpus olivare and corpus restiforme, or rather from the anterior border of the latter, immediately below the glosso-pharyn- geal, and passes out of the skull through the inner extremity of the jugular foramen, being enclosed in a sheath of dura mater, which is common to it and the spinal accessory. The nerve then takes its course down the side of the neck, lying at first between the internal Tympanic, Carotid, Muscular, Pharyngeal, Tonsillitic, Lingual.PNEUMOGASTKIC NERVE. 475 jugular vein and internal carotid artery, and lower down between and behind that vein and the common carotid artery and enclosed in the same sheath. At the root of the neck the course of the nerve on the two sides is different. The right nerve enters the chest by passing between the subclavian artery and vein, and then descends by the side of the trachea to the posterior part of the root of the right lung; from whence it proceeds as a double cord along the posterior aspect of the oesophagus to the corresponding side of the stomach. The two cords reunite upon the lower part of the oesopha- gus. The left nerve enters the chest between the left common carotid and subclavian artery lying behind the left vena innomi- nata ; it then crosses the arch of the aorta, and reaches the posterior part of the root of the left lung, whence it descends, by one or two cords, along the anterior aspect of the oesophagus to the front part of the stomach. In the jugular foramen, the pneumogastric nerve presents a small round ganglion, the superior or jugular ganglion; and immediately at its exit a gangliform swelling, nearly an inch in length, the inferior ganglion (plexus gangliformis). The fibres of origin of the pneumogastric nerve, like those of the glosso-pharyngeal, may be traced through the fasciculi of the corpus restiforme to the grey substance of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The Bra/nches of the pneumogastric nerve are branches of commu- nication and branches of distribution. The Branches of comnmnication proceed from the ganglia : from the superior ganglion one or two branches pass to the spinal acces- sory ; one or two to the superior ganglion of the sympathetic ; and one to the inferior ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal. From the inferior ganglion there pass off branches to the hypoglossal; branches to the superior cervical gangKon of the sympathetic, and branches to the loop between the first and second cervical nerves. The Branches of distribution are Inferior or recurrent laryngeal, The Auricular nerve is given off from the lower part of the jugular ganglion, or from the trunk of the nerve immediately below it, and receives immediately after its origin a small branch of com- munication from the glosso-pharyngeal. It then passes outwards behind the jugular vein, and on the outer side of that vessel enters a small canal (page 35), in the petrous portion of the temporal bone near the stylo-mastoid foramen. Gruided by this canal it reaches the descending part of the aqueductus Fallopii and joins the facial nerve. In the aqueductus Fallopii the auricular nerve gives off two small filaments, one of which communicates with the posterior Auricular, Pharyngeal, Superior laryngeal. Cardiac, Pulmonary anterior. Pulmonary posterior, (Esophageal, Gastric.PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE. 476 auricular branch of tlie facial, pinna. tlie other is distributed to the The Pharyngeal nerve arises from the upper part of the superior ganglion and crosses behind the internal carotid artery to the upper border of the middle constrictor, upon which it forms the pharyngeal plexus assisted by branches from the glosso-pharyngeal, superior laryngeal, and sym- pathetic. The pharyngeal plexus is distributed to the muscles and mucous mem- brane of the pharynx. The Superior laryngeal nerve arises from the inferior ganglion and descends behind the internal carotid artery to the opening in the thyro- hyoidean membrane, through which it passes with the supe- rior laryngeal artery, and is distributed to the mucous membrane of the larynx and * Origin and distribution of the eighth pair of nerres. 1, 3. 4.

On the latter, and behind the cricoid car- tilage, it communicates with the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Be- hind the internal carotid it gives off the external laryngeal branch, which sends a twig to the pharyngeal plexus, and then descends to supply the inferior constrictor, crico-thyroid muscle and thyroid gland. This branch communicates inferiorly with the recurrent laryngeal and sympathetic nerve. The Cardiac branches, two or three in number, arise from the upper and lower part of the cervical portion of the nerve. Those from above communicate with cardiac branches of the sympathetic. One large branch {inferior cardiac) is given off just before the nerve enters the chest; on the right this branch descends by the side of the arteria innominata to the deep cardiac plexus; and on the left it passes in front of the arch of the aorta to the superficial cardiac plexus. One or two cardiac branches also proceed from the thoracic portion of the right pneumogastric nerve. The Inferior laryngeal, or recurrent laryngeal nerve, curves around the subclavian artery on the right, and the arch of the aorta on the left side. It ascends in the groove between the trachea and oesophagus, and piercing the lower fibres of the inferior constrictor muscle enters the larynx close to the articulation of the inferior cornu of the thyroid with the cricoid cartilage. It is distributed to all the muscles of the larynx, with the exception of the crico-thyroid, and communicates on the arytenoideus muscle with the superior laryngeal nerve. As it curves around the subclavian artery and aorta it gives branches (cardiac) to the heart and root of the lungs; and as it ascends the neck it distributes filaments to the oesophagus and trachea, and com- municates with the external laryngeal nerve and sympathetic. The Antenor pulmonary branches, two or three in number, are distributed upon the anterior aspect of the root of the lungs, form- ing, with branches from the cardiac plexuses, the anterior pul- monary plexus. The Posterior pulnnonary branches, more numerous and larger than the anterior, are distributed on the posterior aspect of the root of the lungs; they are joined by filaments from the third and fourth thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic, and form the posterior pul- monary plexus. (Esophageal branches are given off by the pneumogastric nerves above the root of the lungs: below that point, the trunks of the nerves, divided into several cords, form a plexus around the oeso- phagus, the right and left nerves communicating with each other. This plexus accompanies the oesophagus to the stomach, and is the oesophageal plexus (plexus gulae.) The Gastric branches are the terminal filaments of the pneumo- gastric nerves; they are spread out upon the anterior and posterior surface of the stomach, and are likewise distributed to the omentum, spleen, pancreas, liver, and gall-bladder. The branches of the an- terior aspect of the stomach proceed from the left nerve and commu-PNEUMOGASTKIC NERVE. 478 nicate with the hepatic plexus in the lesser omentum ; those of the posterior aspect are derived from the right nerve and communicate with the solar plexus.

It communicates in its course with the posterior root of the first cer- vical nerve, and, entering the foramen lacerum, becomes applied against the posterior aspect of the superior ganglion of the pneumo- gastric, being contained in the same sheath of dura mater. The nerve then passes outwards and downwards, behind and sometimes in front of the internal jugular vein to the upper and under part of the sterno-mastoid, pierces that muscle obliquely and descends across the posterior triangle of the neck to the under surface of the trape- zius to which it is distributed, its branches being continued down- wards to near the lower border of the muscle. The Branches of communication of the spinal accessory are one or two small branches from the superior ganglion of the pneumogastric, and a large branch which joins the pneumogastric between the two ganglia. Its Branches of distribution are muscular branches to the-sterno- mastoid and trapezius. In the substance of the sterno-mastoid it communicates with branches of the cervical plexus, and in the pos- terior triangular space with the third and fourth cervical nerves. The pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerve together (nervus vagus cum accessorio) resemble a spinal nerve, of which the former with its ganglion is the posterior and sensitive root, the latter the anterior and motor root. The deep origin of the spinal accessory may be traced into the grey substance of the floor of the fourth ventricle. Ninth pair.* HYPoaLOSSAL nerve (lingual). The hypoglossal is a nerve of motion, distributed to all the muscles of the tongue, most of those attached to the os hyoides, and the sterno-thyroid. It arises from the groove between the corpus pyramidale and corpus olivare by ten or fifteen filaments, which are collected into two bun- dles, and escape from the cranium through the anterior condyloid fora- men. At its exit from the cranium, the nerve lies behind the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein, then passing forward between the artery and vein it descends to a point parallel with the angle of the lower jaw. It next curves forwards around the occipital artery, with which it forms a loop, and crossing the external carotid and lower part of the hyo-glossus muscle to the genio-hyo-glossus, sends filaments onwards with the anterior fibres of that muscle as far as the tip of the tongue. While resting on the hyo-glossus muscle it is flattened, and beneath the mylo-hyoideus communicates with the gustatory nerve. At its origin, the hypoglossal nerve sometimes communicates with * The twelfth pair according to the arrangement of Soemmering.SPINAL NERVES, 480 the posterior root of the first cervical nerve. Its deep origia may be traced to the grey substance in the floor of the fourth ventricle. The Branches of the hypoglossal nerve are branches of commu- nication and branches of distribution. The Branches of communication of the hypoglossal nerve are, several to the pneumogastric, with which nerve it is closely united; one or two with the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic; and one or two with the loop between the first and second cervical nerves. The Branches of distribution are, Descendens noni, Thyro -hyoidean. Muscular. The Descendens noni is a long and slender nerve, which quits the hypoglossal just as it is about to form its arch around the occipital artery, and descends upon the sheath of the carotid vessels. Just below the middle of the neck it forms a loop with a long branch (communicans noni) derived from the second and third cervical nerves. From the convexity of this loop branches are sent to the stemo- hyoideus, sterno-thyroideus, and both bellies of the omo-hyoideus; sometimes also a twig is given off to the cardiac plexus, and occa- sionally one to the phrenic nerve. If the descendens noni be traced to its origin, it will be found to be formed by a branch from the hypoglossal, and one from the first and second cervical nerves; occa- sionally it receives also a filament from the pneumogastric. The Thyro-hyoidean nerve is a small branch, distributed to the thyro-hyoideus muscle. It is given off by the trunk of the hypo- glossal near the posterior border of the hyo-glossus, and descends obliquely over the great cornu of the os hyoides. The Muscular branches are given off where the nerve is covered in by the mylo-hyoideus muscle, and rests on the hyo-glossus ; several large branches take their course across the fibres of the genio- hyo-glossus to reach the substance of the tongue. Moreover, on the hyo-glossus muscle, the branches of the hypoglossal nerve communi- cate with those of the gustatory nerve. SPINAL NERVES. There are thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves, each arising by two roots, an anterior or motor root, and a posterior or sensitive root. The anterior roots proceed from a narrow white line, anterior lateral sulcus, on the antero-lateral column of the spinal cord, and gradually approach towards the anterior median fissure as they descend.481 SPINAL NERVES. The posterior roots, more regular than the anterior, proceed from the posterior lateral sulcus, a narrow grey stria formed by the internal grey substance of the cord. They are larger, and the filaments of origin more numerous than those of the anterior roots. In the intervertebral foramina there is a ganglion on each of the posterior roots. The first cervical nerve forms an exception to these charac- ters ; its posterior root is smaller than the anterior; it often joins in whole or in part with the spinal accessory nerve, and sometimes with the hypo-glossal: there is frequently no ganglion upon it, and whela the,gangljon ex- ists^ itfeis often situated withiJj tiie^^dtira mater, the latter being the usual position of the ganglia of the last two pairs of spinal nerves. After the formation of a ganglion, the two rqots unite, and con- stitute a spinal nerve, which escapes through the intervertebral fora- men, and separates into an anterior division for the supply of the front aspect of the body, and a posterior division for the posterior aspect. In the first cervical, last sacral, and coccygeal nerve this division takes place within the dura mater and in the upper four sacral nerves externally to that cavity, but within the sacral canal. The anterior divisions, with the exception of the first two cervical nerves, are larger than the posterior; an arrangement which is proportioned to the larger extent of surface they are required to supply, * Part of the cervical portion of the spinal cord, viewed on its posterior aspect; showing its membranes and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. 1, 1.

The Spinal nerves are classed as follows: Cervical Dorsal 8 12 5 5 1 pairs Lumbar Sacral Coccygeal The cervical nerves pass off transversely from the spinal cord ; the dorsal are oblique in direction; the lumbar and sacral, vertical; the latter form the large assemblage of nerves, at the termination of the cord, called cauda equina. The cauda equina occupies the lower third of the spinal canal. The cervical nerves increase in size from above downwards; the first (sub-occipital) passes out of the spinal canal between the occi- pital bone and atlas, the second between the posterior ring of the atlas and the lamina of the axis; and the last between the last cer- vical and first dorsal vertebra. Each nerve, at its escape from the intervertebral foramen, sepa,rates into an anterior and a posterior division. The anterior divisions of the four upper cervical nerves form the cervical plexus; the posterior divisions, \he posterior cer- vical plexus. The anterior divisions of the four inferior cervical together with the first dorsal form the brachial plexus. Anterior cervical nerves.—The anterior division of the first cervical or suboccipital nerve escapes from the vertebral canal through the groove on the posterior arch of the atlas, which sup- ports the vertebral artery, lying beneath that vessel. It then de- scends in front of the transverse process of the atlas, sends twigs to the rectus lateralis and rectus anticus minor, and forms an anasto- motic loop by communicating with an ascending branch of the second nerve. Branches from this loop communicate with the pneumo- gastric nerve, hypoglossal nerve, and first cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. The anterior division of the second cervical nerve at its exit from the intervertebral foramen between the atlas and the axis gives twigs to the rectus anticus major, scalenus posticus, and levator anguli scapulae, and divides into three branches: an ascending branch, which completes the arch of communication with the first nerve; and two descending branches, which form loops with corre- sponding branches of the third nerve. The anterior division of the third cervical nerve, double the size of the preceding, divides at its exit from the intervertebral foramen CERVICAL NERVES.483 CBKVIOAL PLEXUS. into niimerous branches, some of which are distributed to the rectus major, longus colli, and scalenus posticus, while others communicate and form loops and anastomoses with the second and fourth nerve. The anterior division of the fourth cervical nerve, equal in size with the preceding, sends twigs to the rectus major, longus colli, and levator anguli scapulae, communicates by anastomosis with the third, and sends a small branch downwards to the fifth nerve. Its prin- cipal branches pass downwards and outwards across the posterior triangle of the neck, towards the clavicle and acromion. The anterior divisions of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves will be described with the brachial plexus, of which they form a part. Ceevical plexus.—The cervical plexus is constituted by the loops of communication and the anastomoses which take place be- tween the anterior divisions of the first four cervical nerves. The plexus rests upon the levator anguli scapulae, posterior and middle scalenus, and splenius colli muscle, and is covered in by the sterno- mastoid and platysma. The Branches of the cervical plexus may be arranged into three groups, superficial ascending, superficial descending, and deep :— Superficial ( Superficialis colli, Ascending, < Auricularis magnus, ( Occipitalis minor, n 7. \ Acromiales, Descending, < ■ ^ ^' Claviculares. {Communicating branches, -p. J Communicans noni, y • • • Muscular, (Phrenic. The Superficialis colli is formed by communicating branches from the second and third cervical nerves; it curves around the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid and crosses obliquely behind the external jugular vein to the anterior border of that muscle, where it pierces the deep cervical fascia and divides into an ascending and a descend- ing branch. The ascending branch passes upwards to the submaxillary region, and divides into four or five filaments, some of which pierce the platysma myoides, and supply the integument as high up as the chin and lower part of the face; while others form a plexus with the inframaxillary branches of the facial nerve beneath the platysma. One or two filaments from this branch accompany the external jugular vein. The descending branch pierces the platysma and is distributed to the integument of the front of the neck as far downwards as the sternum. I i2484 CERVICAL PLEXUS, The Auricularis magnus, the largest of tlie tliree ascending branches of the cervical plexus, also proceeds from the second and third cervical nerve; it curves around the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and ascends upon that muscle, lying parallel with the external jugular vein, to the parotid gland, where it divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch is distributed to the integument over the parotid gland, and to the gland itself, communicating with the facial nerve. The posterior branch ascends behind the ear where it divides into auricular branches, distributed to the pinna; and a mastoid branch which communicates v/ith the posterior auricular branch of the facial and is distributed to the integument behind the ear. The auricular branches communicate with the auricular offsets of the facial and pneumogastric nerve, and occipitalis minor. The Occipitalis minor arises from the second cervical nerve; it curves around the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid above the I)receding, and ascends upon that muscle, parallel with its posterior border, to the lateral and posterior aspect of the cranium. It is distributed to the integument of this region and to the occipito- frontalis and attoUens aurem, and communicates with the occipitalis major, auricularis magnus, and posterior auricular branch of the facial. Superficial descending branches.—The Acromiales and Clavicu- lares are two or three large nerves which proceed from the fourth cervical nerve, and pass downwards in the posterior triangle of the neck; they then pierce the deep fascia, and crossing the clavicle, are distributed to the integument of the front of the chest from the sternum to the acromion : hence their designation, claviculares and acromiales. The most anterior of the branches is named sternal, from its destination, and the outermost branch passes over the cla- vicular attachment of the trapezius, to reach the shoulder. Deep Branches.—The CommunicaMng branches are filaments which arise from the loop between the first and second cervical nerve, and pass inwards to communicate with the sympathetic, pneumo- gastric, and hypo-glossal nerve. The first three cervical nerves send branches to the first cervical ganglion; the fourth sends a branch to the trunk of the sympathetic, or to the middle cervical ganglion. From the second cervical nerve a large branch is given off, which goes to join the spinal accessory nerve. The Communicans noni is a long and slender branch of commu- nication between the cervical plexus and descendens noni; it is formed by filaments from the second and third cervical nerve; descends on the outer side of the internal jugular vein, and forms a loop with the descendens noni over the sheath of the carotid vessels. The Muscidar branches of the cervical plexus are distributed to the muscles of the front of the vertebral column and side of the neck. From the loop, between the first and second nerve, branchesPOSTERIOR CERVICAL NERVES. 485 are given to the anterior recti. From the second cervical nerve a branch is given to the sterno-mastoid. From the third and fourth nerves branches are given off to the trapezius, levator anguli scapulae, and scalenus posticus. The branch to the trapezius communicates with the spinal accessory nerve. The Phrenic nerve (internal respiratory of Bell) is formed by the union of filaments from the third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerve, and one from the sympathetic. It descends to the root of the neck, resting on the scalenus anticus muscle, crosses the first portion of the subclavian artery, and enters the chest between it and the sub- clavian vein. Within the chest it passes downwards through the middle mediastinum, lying between the pleura and pericardium, and in front of the root of the lung, to the diaphragm; near the diaphragm it divides into branches which pierce that muscle, and are distributed on its under surface. Some of its filaments reach the abdomen through the openings for the cesophagus and vena cava, and communicate with the phrenic and solar plexus, and on the right side with the hepatic plexus. The left phrenic nerve is longer than the right, from the inclination of the heart to the left side, and crosses the arch of the aorta. The right nerve is situated more deeply in the upper part of the chest than the left, and lies in contact with the right vena innominata and superior vena cava. B^th nerves cross in front of the origin of the internal mammary artery at their entrance into the chest. Posterior cervical nerves.—The posterior divisions of the cervical nerves issue from between the transverse processes, and divide into an internal and external branch. The internal branch is directed inwards towards the middle of the spine, and becoming cutaneous near the spinous processes of the vertebrae, is then reflected outwards to supply the integument. The external branch is smaller than the internal, and is distributed to the muscles of the outer portion of the vertebral groove. The posterior division of the first cervical nerve (sub-occipital,) larger than the anterior, escapes from the vertebral canal through the opening for the vertebral artery, lying posteriorly to that vessel, and emerges into the triangular space formed by the rectvis posticus major, obliquus superior, and obliquus inferior. It is distributed to the recti, obliqui and complexus, and sends a branch downwards to communi- cate with the second cervical nerve; it has no external branch. The posterior division of the second cervical nerve is three or four times larger than its anterior division, and exceeds in size the other posterior cervical nerves. Its internal branch is the occipi- talis major nerve. The posterior division of the third cervical nerve is smaller than the second, but larger than the fourth ; its internal branch gives off a cutaneous branch to the back of the cranium.486 BRACHIAL PLEXUS. The posterior divisions of the remaining cervical nerves go on pro- gressively decreasing in size to the seventh. The internal branches of the second, third, fouHh and fifth nerves lie upon the semispinalis colli mnscle, and are closely con- nected with a fascia which separates that mnscle from the complexus. The second and third, with a branch from the first, constitute the posterior cervical plexus; and all the branches in their course to the surface pierce the complexus and trapezius and some the splenius. The internal branches of the sixth, seventh, and eighth nerves pass beneath the semispinalis colli, and are lost in the muscles without reaching the integument. The Occipitalis major nerve, the internal branch of the posterior division of the second cervical nerve, ascends obliquely inwards, between the obliquus inferior and complexus, pierces the complexus and trapezius after passing for a short distance between them, and ascends the posterior aspect of the head in company with the occi- pital artery. Soon after its emergence from the trapezius, it receives a branch from the thii'd cervical, and divides into numerous branches, which are distributed to the occipito-frontalis and integument as far as the summit of the head. It communicates with the occi- pitalis minor nerve, and sends an auricular branch to the back of the ear. BRACHIAL PLEXUS. The Brachial or axillary plexus of nerves is formed by commu- nications between the anterior divisions of the four lower cervical nerves and first dorsal. These nerves are alike in size, and their mode of disposition in the formation of the plexus is the following : the fifth and sixth unite to form a common trunk; the last cervical and first dorsal also unite as soon as they meet, to form a single trunk; the seventh cervical nerve lies for some distance apart from the rest, and then divides into two branches, which join the other cords. At this point the plexus consists of two cords, from which a third is given off, and the three become placed, one to the inner side of the axillary artery, one behind, and one to its outer side. Lower down, each of the lateral cords gives off a branch which unites with its fellow in front of the artery, and completely surrounds that vessel; the trimk formed by the union of these two branches being the median nerve. The plexus is broad in the neck, narrows as it descends into the axilla, and again enlarges at its lower part, where it divides into its terminal branches. The brachial plexus communicates with the cervical plexus by means of a branch from the fourth to the fifth nerve; and receives branches from the two inferior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic. The plexus is in relation in the neck with the scaleni muscles; lower down it is placed between the clavicle and subclavius muscleBRACHIAL NERVES. 487 above, and tlie first rib and first serration of the serratus magnus muscle below. In the axilla, it is situated at first to the outer side of and then behind the axillary artery, resting by its outer border against the tendon of the subscapularis muscle. Lower down it completely surrounds the artery. The branches of the brachial plexus are: from the outer cord, one of the anterior thoracic nerves, the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and the outer head of the median; from the inner cord, the other anterior thoracic nerve, the inner head of the median, the internal cutaneous, the lesser internal cutaneous of Wrisberg, and the ulnar; and from the posterior cord, the subscapular nerves, the circumflex, and musculo-spiral. Besides the above branches, the brachial plexus, while in the neck, gives off several superior muscular branches: one to the sub- clavius muscle, one to the rhomboid muscles and levator anguli scapulae; one, of large size, the suprascapular; and a long and slender nerve which passes down the thoracic wall of the axilla, the posterior thoracic, or external respiratory nerve of Bell. In reference to their distribution, the branches of the brachial plexus may be arranged in three groups, thoracic, scapular, and brachial, as follows :— * Thoracic. Anterior thoracic, Posterior thoracic. Brachial Musculo -cutaneous. Internal cutaneous. Lesser internal cutaneous, Median, Ulnar, Musculo-spiral, Circumflex. The Anterior thoracic nerves, two in number, proceed, one from the external cord of the plexus, the other from the internal cord. The former, the external or superficial branch, crosses the axillary artery in the space above the pectoralis minor to the front of the chest, and is distributed to the pectoralis major muscle. The in- ternal or deeper branch issues from between the axillary artery and vein, and after forming a loop of communication with the preceding is distributed to the under surface of the pectoralis minor and major. The Posterior thoracic, or external respiratory of Bell, is formed by the junction of two offsets, one from the fifth, the other from the sixth cervical nerve; it crosses behind the brachial plexus to reach Scapular. Superior muscular, Suprascapular, Subscapular.488 MTJSCULO-CUTANEOUS NEKVE. the side of the chest, and descends upon the serratus magnus to the lower part of that muscle, to which it is distributed. The Superior muscular nerves are some small branches to the longus colli and scaleni; and branches to the rhomboidei and sub- clavius muscle. The Rhomboid branch proceeds from the fifth cervical nerve, and passing backwards through the fibres of the scalenus medius, and beneath the levator anguli scapulae, is distributed to the under sur- face of the rhomboid muscles. In its course it sometimes gives a branch to the levator anguli scapulae. The Subclavian branch proceeds from the cord formed by the fifth and sixth nerves, and descends in front of the subclavian artery to the subclavius muscle. This nerve usually communicates with the phrenic at its entrance into the chest. The Suprascapular nerve arises from the fifth cervical nerve, and proceeds obliquely outwards to the suprascapular notch ; it then passes through the notch, crosses the supra-spinous fossa beneath the supra-spinatus muscle, and running in front of the concave mar- gin of the spine of the scapula enters the infra-spinous fossa. It is distributed to the supra-spinatus and infra-spinatus muscle, and sends two or three filaments to the shoulder-joint. The Subscapular nerves are three in number; one arises from the brachial plexus above the clavicle, the others from the posterior cord of the plexus within the axilla. The first or smallest supplies the upper part of the subscapularis muscle ; the second and largest (Jong subscapular) follows the course of the subscapular artery, and is distributed to the latissimus dorsi; the third is distributed to the lower part of the subscapularis muscle and teres major. Brachial nerves.—The brachial branches of the plexus are ar- ranged in the following order : the musculo-cutaneous, and one head of the median to the outer side of the artery ; the other head of the median, internal cutaneous, lesser internal cutaneous, and ulnar, upon its inner side; and the circumflex and musculo-spiral behind. The Musculo-cutaneous nerve (external cutaneous, perforans Casserii) arises from the brachial plexus in common with the external head of the median ; pierces the coraco-brachialis muscle, and passes between the biceps and brachialis anticus to the outer side of the bend of the elbow, where it perforates the fascia, and divides into an anterior and posterior branch. These branches pass behind the median cephalic vein, the anterior the larger of the two, taking the course of the radial vein and communicating with the radial nerve on the back of the hand ; the posterior and smaller following the di- rection of the supinator longus, communicating with the internal cutaneous, and at the lower third of the forearm sending ofi" a twig, which accompanies the radial artery to the wrist, and distributes filaments to the synovial membranes of the joint. The musculo-cutaneous nerve supplies the coraco-brachialis, biceps489 MEDIAN NERVE. and brachialis anticus in the upper arm, and the integument of the outer side of the forearm as far as the wrist and hand. The Internal cutaneous nerve, one of the internal and smaller branches of the axillary plexus, arises from the plexus in common with the ulnar and internal head of the median, and passes down the inner side of the arm in company with the basilic vein, giving off several cutaneous filaments in its course. At about the middle of the upper arm it pierces the deep fascia by'the side of the basilic vein and divides into two branches, external and internal. The external branch, the larger of the two, divides into several branches which pass ia front of, and sometimes behind, the median basilic vein at the bend of the elbow, and descend in the course of the pal- maris longus muscle to the wrist, distributing filaments to the inte- gument in their course and communicating with the anterior branch of the musculo-cutaneouson the outer side, and its own internal branch on the inner side of the forearm. The internal branch sends off several twigs to the integument over the inner condyle and olecranon, passes behind the inner condyle, and descends the fore-arm in the course of the ulnar vein as far as the wrist, supplying the integument of the inner side of the forearm, and communicating with the ex- ternal branch of the same nerve in front, and the dorsal branch of th^ ulnar nerve on the wrist. The Lesser internal cutaneous nerve or nerve of Wrisberg, the smallest of the brachial nerves, arises with the preceding from the inner cord of the plexus, and issuing from beneath the axillary vein, descends the inner side of the arm, to the middle of its poste- rior aspect, where it pierces the fascia and is distributed to the in- tegument of the lower third of the upper arm as far as the olecranon. While in the axilla, the nerve of Wrisberg communicates with the intercosto-humeral nerve, and sometimes its place is taken by the latter. The Median nerve, named from its median position in the arm and forearm, arises by two heads which proceed from the outer and inner cords of the plexus and embrace the axillary artery. The nerve lies at first to the outer side of the brachial artery, but crosses it in the middle, sometimes in front and sometimes behind, and get- ting to its inner side descends to the bend of the elbow. It next passes between the two heads of the pronator radii teres and beneath the flexor sublimis digitorum, and runs down the middle of the fore- arm, lying between the latter muscle and the flexor profundus to the wrist. It then dips beneath the annular ligament and enters the palm of the hand. Just above the wrist it is superficial, lying by the outer border of the tendons of the flexor sublimis digitorum. The Branches of the median nerve are,— Muscular, Superficial palmar, Anterior interosseous, Digital.490 MEDIAN NERVE. The Muscular branches are given off by the nerve at the bend of the elbow ; they are distributed to all the muscles of the anterior aspect of the forearm, with the exception of the flexor carpi ul- naris, and ulnar half of the flexor profundus. The branch to the pronator radii teres sends off re- flected filaments to the elbow- joint. The Anterior interosseous is a large branch accompanying the anterior interosseous artery, and supplying the deep layer of muscles of the forearm ; being lost in the pronator quadratus. The Superficialjmlmar branch arises from the median at about the lower fourth of the forearm: it crosses the annular ligament, and is distributed to the integu- ment of the palm of the hand, and to that of the ball of the thumb. The median nerve at its ter- mination in the palm of the hand is spread out and flattened, and divides into six branches, one muscular and five digital. The muscular branch is dis- tributed to the muscles of the ball of the thumb. The digital branches are thus arranged : tivo pass outwards to the thumb and supply its borders; the third passes along the radial side of the index finger, sending a twig to the first lumbricalis in its * Brachial plexus of nerves with its branches and their distribution. 1.

Opposite the base of the first phalanx, each nerve gives off a dorsal branch which runs along the border of the dorsum of the finger. Near its extremity the nerve divides into a -palmar and a dorsal branch ; the former supplying the sentient extremity of the finger ; the latter the structures around and beneath the nail. The digital nerves in their course along the fingers lie to the inner side of and superficially to the arteries ; and the nerve of one side of a finger has no communication with that of the opposite side. The Ulnar nerve is somewhat smaller than the median, behind which it lies, gradually divei'ging from it in its course. It arises from the inner cord of the brachial plexus in common with the internal head of the median and internal cutaneous nerve, and runs down the inner side of the arm, to the groove between the internal condyle and ole- cranon, resting on the internal head of the triceps, and accompanied by the inferior profunda artery. At the elbow it is superficial, and supported by the inner condyle, against which it is easily compressed, gi"viing rise to the thrilling sensation along the inner side of the fore- arm and little finger, ascribed to striking the "funny bone." It then passes between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and descends along the inner side of the forearm, crosses the annular ligament, and divides into two branches, superficial and deep palmar. At the commencement of the middle third of the forearm it becomes applied against the artery, and lies to the ulnar side of that vessel, as far as the hand. The Branches of the ulnar nerve are,— The Articular branches are several filaments to the elbow-joint, given off from the nerve while lying in the groove between the inner condyle and olecranon.

One branch from its upper part, sometimes a separate ofiset from the nerve and sometimes absent, pierces the fascia, and communicates with the internal cutaneous nerve. The Dorsal branch passes backwards beneath the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, at the lower fourth of the forearm, and divides into branches which supply the integument and two fingers and a half on the posterior aspect of the hand, communicating with the radial nerve, with which it forms an arch. The Su])€rficial palmar branch, after giving some twigs to the palmaris brevis and inner border of the hand, divides into three fila- ments, which are distributed, one to the ulnar side of the little finger, one to the adjoining borders of the little and ring finger, and a communicating branch to join the median nerve. The Deep j^olmar branch passes between the abductor and flexor minimi digiti, to the deep palmar arch, s^^pplying the muscles of the little finger, interossei, two ulnar lumbricales, adductor pollicis, and inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis. The MuscuLO-sPiRAL nerve, the largest branch of the brachial plexus, arises from its posterior trunk in common with the circum- flex, and, descending behind the axillary and brachial artery, winds around the humerus between the triceps and the bone, and in com- pany with the superior profunda artery to the space between the brachialis anticus and supinator longus, and thence onwards to the bend of the elbow, where it divides into two branches, radial and posterior interosseous. The Branches of the musculo-spiral nerve are,— The Muscular branches are distributed to the triceps, anconeus, brachialis anticus, supinator longus, and extensor carpi radialis longior. The Cutaneous branches are three in number, internal and two external. The internal branch arises from the nerve in the axilla, and piercing the deep fascia in the upper third of the arm on its poste- rior aspect, communicates with the intercosto-humeral nerve, and is distributed to the integument of the posterior aspect of the upper arm, as far as the olecranon. The external branches pass through the substance of the external head of the triceps, and pierce the deep fascia; one {upper) near the insertion of the deltoid, the other or loiver branch at about the middle of the upper arm. The tipper branch follows the course of the cephalic vein, supplying the integument of the outer and fore part of the upper arm as far as the bend of the elbow. The lower Muscular, Cutaneous, Radial, Posterior interosseous.CIECUMFLEX NERVE. 493 branch passes down the outer side of the forearm, reaches its pos- terior aspect at about the middle, and is continued onwards to the wrist, where it communicates with the posterior branch of the mus- culo-cutaneous. The Radial nerve runs along the radial side of the forearm to the commencement of its lower third; it there passes beneath the tendon of the supinator longus, and at about two inches above the wrist- joint pierces the deep fascia and divides into an external and an in- ternal branch. The external branch, the smaller of the two, is distributed to the outer border of the thumb, and communicates with the posterior branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The internal branch crosses the direction of the extensor tendons of the thumb, and divides into several filaments for the supply of the ulnar border of the thumb, radial border of the index finger, and adjacent borders of the index and middle finger. It communicates above the wrist with the pos- terior branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and on the back of the hand forms an arch by joining with the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve. On the backs of the fingers the digital branches communi- cate with those of the median nerve. In the upper third of the forearm the radial nerve lies beneath the border of the supinator longus muscle ; in the middle third it is in relation with the radial artery, lying to its outer side ; and in the lower third it quits the artery, and passes beneath the tendon of the supinator longus to reach the back of the hand. , The Posterior interosseous nerve, somewhat larger than the radial, separates from the latter at the bend of the elbow, pierces the supinator brevis muscle, and emerges from its lower border on the posterior aspect of the forearm, where it divides into branches which supply all the muscles of the posterior aspect of the fore- arm, with the exception of the anconeus, supinator longus, and extensor carpi radialis longior. One branch, longer than the rest, descends upon the interosseous membrane to the posterior part of the wrist, and forms a gangliform swelling (a common character of nerves which supply joints), from which numerous filaments are distributed to the wrist-joint. The CiRCUMPiiEX NERVE arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus in common with the musculo-spiral. It passes downwards over the border of the subscapularis muscle, winds around the neck of the humerus with the posterior circumflex artery, and splits into an upper and a lower division ; the upper division is continued onwards beneath the deltoid, and distributed to the anterior part of that muscle, some of its branches piercing the muscular fibres and becoming cutaneous. The lower division sends a branch (remarkable for a gangliform swelling) to the teres minor, several branches to the posterior part of the deltoid, and mounting upon the border of the muscle becomes cutaneous, sup-494 INTERCOSTAL NERYES. plying the mtegmnent over its lower half by means of several filaments. Besides its muscular and cutaneous branches, the tronk of the nerve gives off an ai-ticidar branch, "which enters the shoulder- joint at its posterior and under part. DORSAL NERVES. The dorsal nerves are twelve in number on each side ; the first appearing between the first and second dorsal vertebra ; the last between the twelfth dorsal and first lumbar. They are smaller than the lower cervical nerves ; diminish gradually in ske from the first to the tenth, and then increase to the twelfth. Each nerve, as soon as it has escaped from the intei-vertebral foramen, separates into an anterior and posterior division ; the anterior divisions being the intercostal nerves, the posterior the dorsal branches of the dorsal nerves. The Dorsal hranches pass directly backwards between the trans- verse processes of the f ertebrse, lying internally to the anterior costo- transverse ligament, and each nerve divides into an internal and external branch. The internal hranches diminish in size from the first to the last. The six upper branches pass inwards beneath the semispinalis dorsi, between that muscle and the multifidus spinse, and, piercing the rhomboid, trapezius and latissimus dorsi muscles, become cutaneous close to the spinous processes, and are reflected outwards to supply the integument. The six lower branches are lost in the muscles of the spine. The ecdernal hranches increase in size from above downwards, and make their appearance in the line of separation between the longissimus dorsi and sacro-lumbalis. The six upper branches are distributed to those muscles and the levatores costarum. The six lower, after supplying the same muscles, pierce the serratus pos- ticus inferior and latissimus dorsi in a line with the angles of the ribs, and becoming cutaneous, are directed downwards and out- wards over the side of the trunk. Intercostal nerves.—The antericyr divisions of the dorsal nerves, twelve in number on each side, are the intercostal nerres. Each intercostal nerve passes outwards in the intercostal space in company with the intercostal vessels, below which it lies ; at the commencement of its course it rests on the external intercostal muscle, further outwards it is placed between the two planes of intercostal muscles ; beyond the middle of the rib it enters the substance of the internal intercostal and reaches its inner sxirface, being in contact with the pleura; finally, at the anterior extremity of the intercostal space, it crosses the triangularis stemi and inter- nal mammary vessels and pierces the internal intercostal muscle and pectoralis major, to be distributed to the integument of the front of the chest and mammary gland, under the name of anterior495 INTERCOSTAL NERVES. cutaneous. The intercostal nerve, near its origin, receives one or two filaments from the dorsal ganglion of the sympathetic, and midway between the vertebral column and sternum while situated between the intercostal muscles it gives olf a lateral cutaneous branch which pierces the external intercostal muscle and divides into an anterior and posterior twig for the supply of the integument of the side of the thorax. This description applies in full only to the six upper intercostal nerves ; the six lower, with the exception of the last, cross the car- tilages of the ribs where the thorax is deficient and take their course between the internal oblique and transversalis muscle to the sheath of the rectus, and, after supplying that muscle, to the linea alba, by the side of which they reach the integument constituting the anterior cutaneous nerves of the abdomen. The first and the last intercostal nerve are exceptions to this general scheme of distribution. Ilie first ascends over the first rib to join the brachial plexus, and gives off only a small branch, to take the usual course of the other intercostal nerves. The last or twelfth nerve lies below the last rib, and after crossing the qua- dratus lumborum takes its course between the internal oblique and transversalis muscle like the other inferior intercostals. Near its origin it sends a branch, the dorsi-lumbar, downwards to join the firs^ lumbar nerve. The Branches of the intercostal nerves are, muscular, lateral cutaneous, and anterior cutaneous. The Muscular branches are small twigs distributed to the inter- costal and neighbouring muscles. The Lateral cutaneous nerves given off from the intercostals at about the middle of the lateral half of the thorax, pierce the ex- ternal intercostal muscle and pass between the fibres of the serratus magnus above and the obliquus externus below to reach the sur- face. The lateral cutaneous nerve then divides into an anterior and posterior branch. The anterior branches are directed forwards to supply the integument of the antero-lateral aspect of the trunk, some of the superior branches turning around the inferior border of the pectoralis major to the mammary gland. The posterior branches take their course backwards to supply the integument of the postero- lateral aspect of the trunk, some of the superior turning around the posterior border of the axilla to reach the integument over the lower part of the scapula and latissimus dorsi muscle ; and that from the third intercostal being distributed to the integument of the axilla and neighbouring part of the arm. The first intercostal gives off no lateral cutaneous nerve ; the lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve will be presently described, under the name of intercosto-humeral nerve. The lateral cutaneous branch of the last intercostal nerve pierces the internal and external oblique muscle, crosses the crest of the ilium just behind the tensor vaginae femoris, and is distributed toLUMBAR NERVES. 496 the integument of the anterior part of the gluteal region as low down as the trochanter major. The Anterior cutaneous nerves are divided according to their position into those of the thorax and those of the abdomen. Having reached the surface they are reflected outwards to supply the integument of the front of the trunk. The anterior cutaneous branches of the third and fourth intercostal nerves are distributed to the mammary gland. The Intercosto-hiimeral nerve is the lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve ; after piercing the external inter- costal muscle it passes downwards into the axilla and communicates with a branch of the lesser internal cutaneous nerve of AYrisberg. It then perforates the deep fascia and is distributed to the integu- ment of the inner and back part of the arm to about the middle, and to the integument covering the lower part of the scapula. On the back of the arm it commimicates with the internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve. This nerve sometimes takes the place of the nerve of Wrisberg. LUMBAR NERVES. There are five pairs of lumbar nerves, of which the first makes its appearance between the first and second lumbar vertebra; the last between the fifth lumbar and the base of the sacrum. The anterior divisions increase in size from above downwards. They communicate at their origin with the lumbar ganglia of the sympa- thetic, and pass obliquely outwards behind the psoas magnus, or between its fasciculi, sending twigs to that muscle and to the quad- ratus lumborum.^ In this situation each nerve divides into two branches, a superior branch which ascends to form a loop of com- munication with the nerve above; and an inferior branch which de- scends to join in like manner the nerve below. The communications and anastomoses which are thus established constitute the lumbar plexus. The ^posterior divisions diminish in size from above downwards ; they pass backwards between the transverse processes of the corre- sponding vertebrae, and each nerve divides into an internal and an external branch. The internal branch, the smaller of the two, passes inwards to be distributed to the multifidus spinse and inter- spinales. The external branches commimicate with each other by several loops, and, after supplying the deeper muscles, pierce the sacro-lumbalis to reach the integument to which they are distributed. The external branches of the three upper lumbar nerves descend over the posterior part of the crest of the ilium, and are distributed to the integument of the gluteal region. Lumbar plexus.—The Lumbar plexus is formed by the commu- nications and anastomoses which take place between the anterior497 LUMBAR PLEXUS. divisions of the four upper lumbar nerves, and between the latter and the last dorsal. It is narrow above, increases in breadth in- feriorly, and is situated between the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae and quadratus lumborum behind, and the psoas magnus muscle in front. The Branches of the lumbar plexus are the— Ilio-hypogastric, External cutaneous, Ilio-inguinal, Obturator, Grenito-crural, Anterior crural. The Ilio-hypogastric nerve (superior musculo-cutaneous) pro- ceeds from the first lumbar nerve, and passes obliquely outwards between the fibres of the psoas magnus and across the quadratus lumborum to about the middle of the crest of the ilium. It then pierces the transversalis muscle, and between it and the internal oblique divides into its two terminal branches, iliac and hypogastric. The iliac hranch pierces the internal and external oblique muscles close to their attachment, and a little behind the middle of the crest of the ilium; it is distributed to the integument of the outer part of the hip. The hypogastric hranch continues its course onwards, piercing firgt the internal oblique, and just above the external abdominal rin'g the aponeurosis of the external oblique. It is distributed to the integument of the hypogastric region and mons pubis. The Ilio-inguinal nerve (inferior musculo-cuta.neous), smaller than the preceding, also arises from the first lumbar nerve. It passes obliquely downwards and outwards below the ilio-hypogastric nerve, and crosses the quadratus lumborum and iliacus muscle to the anterior part of the crest of the ilium; it then pierces the transversalis muscle, and between that muscle and the obliquus in- ternus communicates with the hypogastric nerve. It next pierces the obliquus internus, and following the course of the spermatic cord, escapes at the external abdominal ring to be distributed to the scrotum and to the integument of the upper part of the thigh, internally to the saphenous opening; and in the female to that of the pudendum. The Genito-crural nerve proceeds from the second lumbar and by a few filaments from the loop between it and the first. It traverses the psoas magnus from behind forwards, and runs down the anterior surface of that muscle, lying beneath its fascia, to near Poupart's ligament, where it divides into a genital and a crural branch. The genital hranch (n. spermaticus sen pudendus externus) crosses the external iliac artery to the internal abdominal ring, and descends along the spermatic canal, lying behind the cord, to the scrotum, where it distributes twigs to the spermatic cord and cremaster muscle. In the female it gives twigs to the round ligament andEXTERNAL CUTANEOUS KERVE. 498 Fig. 174 * external labium.

It pierces the sheath below Poupart's ligament, and is distributed to the integument of the anterior as- pect of the thigh as far as its middle. This nerve communicates with the middle cutaneous branch of the crural nerve, and is often very small. The External cutaneous nerve (inguino-cutaneous) proceeds from the second lumbar, and from the loop between it and the third. It pierces the posterior fibres of the psoas ^ / 20 * A diagram showing tlie lumbar and sacral plexuses, with the nerves of the lower extremity. 1.

The posterior branch crosses the tensor vaginse femoris muscle to the outer and posterior side of the thigh, and supplies the integu- ment in that region. The anterior nerve, after passing for three or four inches down the thigh in a sheath formed by the fascia lata, becomes superficial, and divides into two branches, which are distributed to the integu- ment of the outer border of the thigh, and to the articulation of the knee. The Obturator nerve is formed by a branch from the third, and another from the fourth lumbar nerve, and is distributed to the obturator externus and adductor muscles of the thigh, the hip and knee joint, the femoral and popliteal artery, and sometimes to the integument of the upper and inner part of the leg. From its origin it takes its course among the fibres of the psoas muscle, through the angle of bifurcation of the common iliac vessels, and along the inner border of the brim of the pelvis, to the obturator foramen, where it joins the obturator artery. Having escaped from the' pelvis, it divides into an anterior and posterior branch. The anterior branch passes downwards in front of the adductor brevis, supplies that muscle together with the pectineus, gracilis, and adductor longus, and at the lower border of the latter unites with the internal cutaneous and long saphenous nerve, to form a plexus. It then passes onwards to the femoral artery, to which it distributes filaments. In its course this nerve gives off an articular branch to the hip-joint; and a cutaneous branch, which pierces the fascia lata at the knee, communicates with the long saphenous nerve, and is distributed to the integument of the inner side of the leg as far as its middle. This branch is often wanting, its place being supplied by the internal cutaneous nerve, and sometimes by the access6ry obturator. The posterior branch pierces the obturator externus muscle, to which and to the adductor magnus it distributes branches; it also gives off an articular branch which pierces the adductor magnus muscle, and accompanies the popliteal artery to the knee-joint. The A ccessory obturator nerve, small and inconstant, is a high division of the obturator, being sometimes derived from it near its origin, and sometimes by separate filaments from the third and fourth lumbar nerves. It passes down the inner border of the psoas muscle, crosses the os pubis, and dips beneath the pectineus, where it divides into branches. One of its branches is distributed to the pectineus, another supplies the hip-joint, while a third com- municates with the anterior branch of the olaturator nerve, and K K 2ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE. 500 when of large size constitutes its cutaneous brancli. As already stated, the existence of the accessory obturator nerve is uncertain. The Anterior crural, or Femoral nerve, is the largest of the divisions of the lumbar plexus; it is formed by the union of branches from the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerve, and is distributed to the integument of the front and inner side of the thigh, leg, and foot, to all the muscles of the front of the thigh (excepting one), to the iliacus, pectineus, femoral artery, and knee-joint. Emerging from beneath the psoas, the nerve passes downwards in the groove between that muscle and the iliacus, and beneath Poupart's ligament into the thigh, where it spreads out and divides into numerous branches. At Poupart's ligament it is separated from the femoral artery by the breadth of the psoas muscle, which at this point is scarcely more than half an inch in diameter, and by the iliac fascia, beneath which it lies. Brandies.-—^Within the pelvis, the anterior crural nerve gives off three or four twigs to the iliacus muscle, and a branch to the femo- ral artery. The latter divides into filaments which entwine about the artery, and follow its course downwards in the thigh. Below Poupart's ligament the crural nerve becomes flattened out, and divides into numerous branches, which may be arranged into two principal groups, superficial and deep. The separate branches of these groups are as follow :— Long or Internal saphenous, The Middle cutaneous nerve pierces the fascia lata at about three inches below Poupart's ligament, and divides into two branches, which pass down the inner and front part of the thigh, and are dis- tributed to the integument as low as the knee-joint. At its upper part the external branch communicates with the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve; and below, the internal branch communi- cates with the internal cutaneous. One or both of these branches sometimes pierce the sartorius muscle. The Internal cutaneous nerve passes inwards in front of the sheath of the femoral artery, and divides into an anterior and an inner branch. Previously to its division it gives off three cutaneous filaments, which pierce the fascia near the internal saphenous vein, and, following the course of that vessel, are distributed to the in- tegument of the inner side of the thigh as low down as the knee. The uppermost of these filaments passes through the saphenous opening, the middle becomes subcutaneous at about the middle of the thigh, and the lowest pierces the fascia at its lower third. The anterior branch passes down the inner side of the thigh, and Superficial. Middle cutaneous, Internal cutaneous, Beep. Muscular, Articular.INTERNAL SAPHENOUS NERVE. 501 pierces the fascia at its lower third, near the internal saphenous vein. It then divides into two twigs, one of which continues on- wards to the inner side of the knee; while the other curves outwards to its outer side, communicating in its course with a branch of the long saphenous nerv^e. The inner branch descends along the inner and posterior border of the sartorius muscle to the knee, where it pierces the fascia lata, and gives off several cutaneous twigs. It then sends a small branch of communication to the long saphenous nerve, and passes down- wards along the inner side of the leg, to which it is distributed. While beneath the fascia lata it aids in the formation of a plexus by uniting with branches of the long saphenous nerve and descending branch of the obturator. When the latter is large the inner branch of the internal cutaneous nerve is small, and may terminate in the plexus, or merely give off a few cutaneous filaments. The Long or internal saphenous nerve inclines inwards to the sheath of the femoral vessels, and passes downwards in front of the sheath and beneath the aponeurotic expansion which covers the sheath, to the opening in the adductor magnus. It then quits the femoral vessels, and, continuing to descend, passes between the ten- dons of the sartorius and gracilis, and reaches the internal saphenous vein. By the side of the latter it passes down the inner side of the leg, in front of the inner ankle, and along the inner side of the foot as far as the great toe; being distributed to the integument in its course. The branches of the long saphenous nerve in the thigh are : one or two to join the plexus formed by the obturator and internal cuta- neous nerve; and a large branch, the cutaneus patellce, which pierces the sartorius and fascia lata at the inner side of the knee, and divides into many twigs, which are distributed to the integu- ment of the front of the knee. Above the patella this branch com- municates with the anterior branch of the internal cutaneous nerve, and with the terminal twigs of the middle, and external cutaneous. Below the patella it communicates with other branches of the long saphenous; the whole of these communications constituting a kind of plexus (plexus patellae). The branches of the long saphenous nerve below the knee are dis- tributed to the integument of the front and inner side of the leg. By one of these branches it communicates with the cutaneous branch of the obturator nerve. The Muscular branches of the anterior crural nerve supply all the muscles of the front of the thigh (with the exception of the tensor vaginse femoris, which obtains its nerve from the superior gluteal) and the pectineus. The branch to the pectineus passes behind the sheath of the femoral vessels; the branches to the sar- % torius, three or four in number, arise with the cutaneous nerves, and sometimes are supplied by the latter. The branch to the rectus enters the deep surface of that muscle. The branch to the vastus502 SACRAL NERVES. externiis follows tlie course of the descending branch of the external circumflex artery ; the branch to the criireus passes directly to that muscle; and the branch to the ixistus internus, remarkable for its length, descends by the side of the sheath of the femoral vessels. The Articular branches are distributed to the knee-joint; one enters the joint on its outer side, being derived from the nerve of the vastus externus ; the other, proceeding from the nerve of the vastus internus, descends with the anastomotica magna to a level with the joint, and then pierces the capsular ligament. The LrMBO-SACRAL nerve.—The anterior division of the fifth lumbar nerre, conjoined with a branch from the fourth, constitutes the lumbo-sacral nerve, which descends over the base of the sacrum into the pelvis, and assists in forming the sacral plexus. SACRAL nerves. There are five pairs of sacral nerves ; the first four escape from the vertebral canal through the sacral foramina, and the last between the sacrum and coccyx. The posterior sacral nerves are small, and diminish in size from above downwards; they communi- cate with each other by means of anastomosing loops immediately after their escape fi-om the posterior sacral foramina, and divide like the other spinal neiwes into external and internal branches. The external branches pierce the gluteus maximus, to which they give filaments, and are distributed to the integument of the pos- terior part of the gluteal region. The internal branches supply the multifidus spinas muscle and the integument over the sacrum and coccyx. The anterior sacral nerves diminish in size from above down- wards ; the frst is large, and unites with the lumbo-sacral nerve; the second, of equal size, unites with the fii'st; and the third, scarcely one-fourth so large as the second, joins with the two pre- ceding nerves in the formation of the sacral plexus. The fovj'th sacral nerve divides into two branches, one of M^hich assists in forming the sacral plexus, the other separates into three branches: a communicating branch to unite with the fifth sacral nerve ; a visceral branch, to join with the hypogastric plexus and supply the bladder and prostate gland, and in the female, the vagina ; and a muscular branch which sends filaments to the levator ani and coccygeus and a.n hcE?norrhoidal branch to the sphincter ani and integument behind the anus. The fifth sacral nerve, issuing from between the sacrum and coccyx, pierces the coccygeus muscle, and receives the communi- cating branch from the fourth ; it then communicates with the coccygeal nerve, and piercing the coccygeus a second time, is dis- tributed to the integument over the dorsal surface of the coccyx. The coccygeal nerve pierces the coccygeus muscle, and unites with the fifth sacral nerve, in which it is lost.503 SACRAL PLEXUS. Each of the anterior divisions of the sacral nerves receives a filament from the sympathetic at its point of escape from the sacral canal. Sacral plexus.—The Sacral plexus is formed by the union of the lumbo-sacral, and the anterior divisions of the three upper sacral nerves and one-half the fourth. The plexus is triangular in form, its base corresponding with the whole length of the sacrum, and its apex with the lower part of the great ischiatic foramen. It is in relation behind with the pyriformis muscle ; and in front with the pelvic fascia, which separates it from the internal iliac vessels and viscera of the pelvis. The Branches of the sacral plexus are, The Visceral nerves are three or four large branches which are derived from the fourth and fifth sacral nerves: they ascend upon the side of the rectum and bladder ; in the female upon the side of the rectum, vagina, uterus, and bladder; and interlace with branches of the hypogastric plexus, sending in their course nume- rous filaments to the pelvic viscera. The Muscular hrancJies are one or two twigs to the levator ani ; an obturator hranch, which curves around the spine of the ischium to reach the internal surface of the obturator internus muscle ; two twigs to the pyriformis; a branch to the gemellus superior; and a branch of moderate size, which descends between the gemelli muscles and the ischium, and is distributed to the gemellus inferior, quadratus femoris, and capsule of the hip-joint. The Superior gluteal nerve arises from the lumbo-sacral near its junction with the first sacral nerve ; it passes out of the pelvis with the gluteal artery, through the great sacro-ischiatic foramen, and divides into a superior and an inferior branch. The superior branch follows the direction of the superior curved line of the ilium, accompanying the deep superior branch of the gluteal artery, and sends filaments to the gluteus medius and minimus. The inferior branch passes obliquely downwards and forwards between the gluteus medius and minimus, distributing numerous filaments to both, and terminates in the tensor vaginae femoris muscle. The PuDic nerve arises from the lower part of the sacral plexus and passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro-ischiatic foramen below the pyriformis muscle. It crosses the spine of the ischium, and re-entering the pelvis through the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen. Visceral, Muscular, Superior gluteal. Pudic, Lesser ischiatic. Greater ischiatic.LESSER ISCHIATIO NERVE. 504 accompanies the internal pudic artery along the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa, lying inferiorly to the artery and enclosed in the same sheath. Near its origin it gives off the inferior Jicemorrhoidal nerve, and in the ischio-rectal fossa divides into a superior and in- ferior branch. The Inferior^hcemorrhoidal nerve, often a branch of the sacral plexus, passes through the lesser sacro-ischiatic foramen, and descends to the termination of the rectum to be distributed to the sphincter ani and integument. The Dorsalis penis nerve, the superior division of the internal pudic, ascends along the posterior surface of the ramus of the ischium, pierces the triangular ligament, and accompanies the arteria dorsalis penis to the glans, to which it is distributed. At the root of the penis the nerve gives off a cutaneous branch which runs along the side of the organ, gives filaments to the corpus cavernosum, and with its fellow of the opposite side supplies the integument of the upper two-thirds of the penis. The Perineal nerve, or inferior terminal branch, larger than the preceding, pursues the course of the superficial perineal artery in the perineum and divides into cutaneous and muscular branches. , The cutaneous branches (superficial perineal), two in number, ■posterior and anterior, enter the ischio-rectal fossa and pass for- ward with the superficial perineal artery to be distributed to the integument of the perineum, scrotum, and under part of the penis. The posterior superficial perineal nerve sends a few filaments to the integument of the anus and sphincter ani ; while the anterior gives oif one or two twigs to the levator ani. The muscular branches proceed from a single trunk, which passes inwards behind the transversus perinei muscle; they are distri- buted to the transversus perinei, accelerator urinse, and erector penis. The perineal nerve also sends two or three filaments to the corpus spongiosum. In the female the pudic nerve is distributed to the parts analo- gous to those of the male. The sujoerior branch supplies the clitoris; the inferior the vulva and perineum. The Lesser ischiatic nerve passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro-ischiatic foramen below the pyriformis muscle, and continues its course downwards through the thigh to the lower part of the popliteal region, where it pierces the fascia and becomes sub- cutaneous. It then accompanies the external saphenous vein to the lower part of the leg, and communicates with the external saphenous nerve. The branches of the lesser ischiatic nerve are, muscular and cutaneous. The muscular or inferior gluteal are several large branches distributed to the gluteus maximus. The Cutaneous branches are divisible into external, internal, and middle. The external cutaneous branches are several filamentsGREAT ISCHIATIC NERVE. 505 which turn arotmd the lower border of the gluteus maximus, and are distributed to the integument over the hip and outer side of the thigh. The internal cutaneous branches are distributed to the in- teg-ument of the upper and inner part of the thigh. One of these larger than the rest, inferior pudendal, curves around the tuberosity of the ischium, pierces the fascia lata near the ramus of that bone, and, after communicating v/ith the superficial perineal nerve, is distributed to the integument of the scrotum and penis. The middle cutaneo'us branches, two or three in number, are derived from the lesser ischiatic in its course down the thigh, and are dis- tributed to the integument. The Great ischiatic nerve is the largest nervous cord in the body ; it is formed by the sacral plexus, or rather is a prolongation of the plexus, and at its exit from the great sacro-ischiatic foramen beneath the pyriformis muscle measures three quarters of an inch in breadth. It descends through the middle of the space between the trochanter major and tuberosity of the ischium, and along the pos- terior part of the thigh to its lower third, where it divides into two large terminal branches, internal and external popliteal. This division sometimes takes place at the plexus, and the two nerves descend side by side ; occasionally they are separated at their commencement by a part or by the whole of the pyriformis muscle. The nerve in its course down the thigh rests on the gemellus supe- rior, tendon of the obturator internus, gemellus inferior, quadratus femoris, and adductor magnus, and is covered in by the gluteus maximus and biceps muscle. The Branches of the great ischiatic nerve, previously to its division, are, muscular and articular. The Muscular branches are given off from the upper part of the nerve and supply both heads of the biceps, the semi-tendinosus, semi-membranosus, and adductor magnus. The Ai'ticular branch descends to the upper part of the external condyle of the femur, and divides into filaments which are distri- buted to the fibrous capsule and synovial membrane of the knee- joint. The Internal popliteal nerve passes through the middle of the popliteal space, from the division of the great ischiatic nerve to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, accompanies the artery beneath the arch of the soleus, and becomes the posterior tibial nerve. It is superficial in the whole of its course, and lies exter- nally to the vein and artery. The Branches of the popliteal nerve are, ,muscular or sural, articular, and a cutaneous branch, the external saphenous nerve. The Muscular branches, of considerable size, and four or five in number, are distributed to the two heads of the gastrocnemius, to the soleus, plantaris, and popliteus. The Articidar branches, tvi^o or three in number, supply thePLANTAR NERVES. 506 knee-joint, two of the twigs accompanying the internal articular arteries. The External or short saphenous nerve (commnnicans poplitei, vel tibialis) proceeds from the middle of the internal popliteal, and descends in the groove between the two bellies of the gastrocnemius muscle to the middle of the leg ; it then pierces the fascia, and, after receiving the communicans peronei, comes into relation with the external saphenous vein, and follows the course of that vein to the outer ankle, to which, and to the integument of the heel and foot, it distributes branches. The Posterior tibial nerve is continued along the posterior aspect of the leg from the lower border of the popliteus muscle to the posterior part of the inner ankle, where it divides into the in- ternal and external plantar nerve. In the upper part of its course it lies to the inner side of the posterior tibial artery ; it then be- comes placed superficially to that vessel, and at the ankle is situ- ated to its outer side ; in the lower third of the leg it lies parallel with the inner border of the tendo-Achillis. The Branches of the posterior tibial nerve are, three or four muscular twigs to the deep muscles of the posterior aspect of the leg, the branch to the flexor longus pollicis accompanies the fibular artery ; one or two filaments which entwine around the artery and then terminate in the integument ;* and a plantar cutaneous branch which pierces the internal annular ligament and is distributed to the integument of the heel, and inner border of the sole of the foot. The Internal plantar nerve, larger than the external, crosses the posterior tibial vessels to enter the sole of the foot, and becomes placed between the abductor pollicis and flexor brevis digitorum ; it then enters the sheath of the latter muscle, and divides opposite the base of the metatarsal bones into three digital branches ; one to supply the adjacent sides of the great and second toe; the second the adjacent sides of the second and third toe ; and the third the corresponding sides of the third and fourth toe. This distribution is precisely similar to that of the digital branches of the median nerve in the hand. In its course the internal plantar nerve gives ofi" cutaneous branches to the integument of the inner side and sole of the foot; muscular branches to the muscles forming the inner and middle group of the sole ; a digital branch to the inner border of the great toe ; and articular branches to the articulations of the tarsal and metatarsal bones. The External plantar nerve, the smaller of the two, follows * It is extremely interesting, in a physiological point of view, to observe the mode of distribution of these filaments. I have traced them in relation with several, and I have no doubt that they exist in connexion vrith all the superficial arteries. They seem to be the direct monitors to the artery of the presence or approach of danger.507 EXTERNAL POPLITEAL NERVE. • the course of the external plantar artery to the outer border of the musculus accessorius, beneath which it sends several deep branches to supply the adductor poUicis, interossei, transversus pedis and the articulations of the tarsal and metatarsal bones. It then gives branches to the integument of the outer border and sole of the foot, and sends forward two digital branches to supply the little toe and half the next. The External popliteal nerve (peroneal) one half smaller than the internal, passes downwards by the side of the tendon of the biceps, and crosses the, inner head of the gastrocnemius and the head of the soleus, to the neck of the fibula, it then pierces the peroneus longus muscle, and divides into two branches, anterior tibial and musculo-cutaneous. The Branches of the external popliteal nerve are, the communi- cans peronei, cutaneous, and articular. The Communicans peronei, proceeding from the external pop- liteal near the head of the fibula, crosses the external origin of the gastrocnemius muscle, and, piercing the deep fascia, descends to the middle of the leg, where it joins the external saphenous nerve. It gives oif one or two cutaneous filaments in its course. ;The Cutaneous branch passes down the outer side of the leg, sup- pling the integument. The Articular branches follow the external articular arteries to the knee-joint. ■ The Anterior tibial nerve (interosseous) commences at the bifurcation of the external popliteal upon the neck of the fibula, and passes beneath the upper part of the extensor longus digitorum, to reach the outer side of the anterior tibial artery, just as that vessel has emerged through the opening in the interosseous mem- brane. It descends the leg with the artery; lying at first to its outer side, then in front of it, and near the ankle becoming again placed to its outer side. Reaching the ankle it passes beneath the annular ligament; accompanies the dorsalis pedis artery, supplies the adjacent sides of the great and second toes, and communicates with the internal division of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The Branches given ofi" by the anterior tibial nerve are, muscular to the muscles in its course ; and at the ankle a tarsal branch which may be considered as one of the terminal divisions of the nerve. This branch passes outwards upon the dorsum of the foot, becomes ganglionic like the posterior interosseous nerve at the wrist, and sup- plies the extensor brevis digitorum muscle and the articulations of the tarsus and metatarsus. The Musculo-cutaneous nerve passes downwards along the fibula, in the substance of the peroneus longus; it then gets between the peroneus longus and brevis, next between the peronei and ex- tensor longus digitorum, and at the lower third of the leg piercesSYMPATHETIC NERVES. 508 the deep fascia, and divides into tlie internal and external cutaneous nerves of the foot. In its course it gives off several branches to the peronei muscles. The internal branch, the smaller of the two, is distributed to the inner side of the foot and great toe, and communicates with the anterior tibial and internal saphenous. The external, or larger branch, supplies the adjacent sides of the second and third, third and fourth, and fourth and fifth toes, and communicates with the external saphenous. SYMPATHETIC NERVES. The Sympathetic consists of a vertebral and prevertebral portion ; the vertebral portion is composed of a series of ganglia united by an intermediate cord, extending along each side of the vertebral column from the head to the coccyx, communicating with all the other nerves of the body, and distributing branches to all the internal organs and viscera. The prevertebral portion is that part of the sympathetic which is distributed to the viscera, comprising the numerous plexuses of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis. The sympathetic nerve communicates with the other nerves imme- diately at their exit from the cranium and vertebral canal. The fourth and sixth nerves, however, form an exception to this rule, for with these it unites in the cavernous sinus; with the olfactory in the nose; and with the auditory in the meatus auditorius internus. The branches of distribution accompany the arteries which supply the different organs, and form communications around them which are called plexuses and take the name of the artery with which they are associated : thus we have the n^esenteric plexus, hepatic plexus, splenic plexus, &c. All the internal organs of the head, neck, and trunk are supplied with branches from the sympathetic, and some of them exclusively; hence it is denominated the nerve of organic life. It is called the ganglionic nerve from being constituted of a number of ganglia; and from the constant disposition which it evinces in its distribution, to communicate and form small knots or ganglia. There are four sympathetic ganglia in the head ; namely, the oph- thalmic or lenticular, the spheno-palatine or Meckel's, the otic or Arnold's, and the submaxillary; three in the neck, superior, middle, and inferior cervical; twelve in the dorsal region; four in the lumbar region; and four or five in the sacral region. Each ganglion may be considered as a distinct centre, from which branches are given off in four different directions, viz., superior or ascending, to communicate with the ganglion above; inferior or descending, to communicate with the ganglion below ; external, to communicate with the spinal nerves; and internal, to communicateSPHENO-PALATINE GANGLION. 509 with tlie sympathetic filaments of the opposite side, and be distri- buted to the viscera. As regards the spinal nerves it receives as well as gives, the white fibres of the sympathetic being derived from the cerebro-spinal nerves. CRANIAL PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. Cranial Ganglia. Ophthalmic, or lenticular ganglion, Spheno-palatine, or Meckel's ganglion, Otic, or Arnold's ganglion, Submaxillary ganglion. The Ophthalmic ganglion {ciliary; lenticular) is a small qua- drangular and flattened ganglion situated within the orbit, between the optic nerve and the external rectus muscle; it is in close contact with the optic nerve and generally with the ophthalmic artery; and is surrounded by adipose tissue, which renders its dissection some- what difi&cult. It is of a reddish-grey colour, like other sympathetic ganglia. Its branches of distribution are the short ciliary nerves, which arise from its anterior angles in two groups : the upper group con- sisting of about- four filaments; the lower, of five or six. They accompany the ciliary arteries in a waving course, and divide into filaments which pierce the sclerotic around the optic nerve, to sup- ply the tunics of the eyeball. A small filament is said, by Tiede- mann, to accompany the arteria centralis retinge into the centre of the globe of the eye. Its branches of communication are three, one, the long root, which proceeds from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve and joins its superior angle; a short and thick branch, the short root, from the inferior division of the third nerve to its inferior angle; and a slender filament, the sympathetic root, from the carotid plexus. Occasionally the ophthalmic ganglion receives also a filament of communication from the spheno-palatine ganglion; and sometimes from the abducens nerve. The Spheno-palatine ganglion (Meckel's), the largest of the cranial ganglia of the sympathetic, is situated in the spheno-maxil- lary fossa, a little below the superior maxillary nerve. It is of small size, of a reddish-grey colour, and triangular in shape; and is placed upon the posterior part of the spheno-palatine nerves which it only partially involves. Its branches are divisible into four groups; ascending, descending, internal, and posterior. The ascending branches are three or four small filaments which are distributed to the periosteum of the orbit. One of these branches sometimes joins the ophthalmic ganglion : one the sixth nerve; and two the optic nerve.SPHENO-PALATIFE GANGLION. 510 The descending branches are the three palatine nerves, anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior or large palatine nerve descends from the ganglion through the posterior palatine canal, and emerges at the posterior palatine foramen. It then passes forward in the substance of the hard palate to which it is distributed, and communicates with the Fig. 175.* * Cranial ganglia of the sympathetic nerre. 1. Ganglion of Eibes. 2.

While in the posterior palatine canal, this nerve gives off several branches *(m/mor nasal), which enter the nose through openings in the palate bone, and are distributed to the middle and inferior meatus, the inferior spongy bone, and the antrum. The middle or external palatine nerve descends externally to the preceding to the posterior palatine foramen, and distributes branches to the tonsil, soft palate, and uvula. Th.e posterior or small palatine nerve, quits the other nerves to enter a distinct canal, from which it emerges by a separate opening behind the posterior palatine foramen. It is distributed to the hard palate and gums near the point of its emergence, and also to the tonsil, soft palate, and uvula. The internal branches are the superior nasal and the naso-pala- tine. The superior nasal nerves, four or five in number, enter the nasal fossa through the spheno-palatine foramen, and are distributed to the mucous membrane of the superior meatus, and superior and middle spongy bone. The naso-p)alatine nerve (Scarpa) enters the nasal fossa with the nasal nerves, and crosses the roof of the nares to reach the septum, to which it gives filaments. It then curves downwards and forwards to the naso-palatine canal, and passes through that canal to the palate, to which and to the papilla behind the incisor teeth it is dis- triliuted. This nerve was described by Cloquet as uniting with its fellow in the naso-palatine canal and constituting the naso-palatine ganglion. The existence of this ganglion is disputed. .^]xQposterior branches are the Vidian or pterygoid nerve, and the pharyngeal. The Vidian* nerve passes directly backwards from the spheno- palatine ganglion, through the pterygoid or Vidian canal, to the fora- men lacerum basis cranii, where it divides into two branches, carotid and petrosal. The carotid hranch (n. petrosus profundus) crosses the foramen lacerum, surrounded by the cartilaginous substance which closes that opening, and enters the carotid canal to join the carotid plexus. The petrosal hranch (n. petrosas superficialis major) enters the cranium through the foramen lacerum basis cranii, pierc- ing the cartilaginous substance, and passes backwards beneath the Casserian ganglion and dura mater, embedded in a groove on the anterior surface of the petrous bone, to the hiatus Fallopii. In the hiatus Fallopii it receives a branch from Jacobson's nerve, and ter- minates in the intumescentia gangliformis of the facial nerve. The pharyngeal nerve is a small branch which passes backwards through the pterygo-palatine canal with the pterygo-palatine artery, * Gruido Guidi, latinised into Vidus Vidius, was professor of anatomy and medicine in the College of France in 1543. His work is posthumous, and was pubUshed in 16117512 CAROTID PLEXUS. to be distributed to the mucous membrane of the Eustachian tube and neighbouring part of the pharynx. The Otic ganglion (Arnold's)* is a small oval-shaped and flat- tened ganglion, which lies against the inner surface of the inferior maxillary nerve, close to the foramen ovale; it is in relation, ex- ternally, with the trunk of that nerve, just at the point of union of the motor root; internally it rests against the cartilage of the Eustachian tube and tensor palati muscle; and posteriorly is in con- tact with the arteria meningea media. It is closely adherent to the internal pterygoid nerve, and appears like a swelling upon that branch. The branches of the otic ganglion are six in number; two of dis- tribution, and four of communication. The branches of distribution are, a small filament to the tensor tympani muscle, and one or two to the tensor palati. The bran cites of communication are, one or two filaments from the inferior maxillary nerve (short root); one or two filaments from the auriculo-temporal nerve; filaments from the nerAT. moUes of the arteria meningea media, and the nervus petrosus superficialis minor (longroot). The latter nerve ascends from the ganglion to a small canal situated between the foramen ovale and foramen spinosum, and passes backwards on the petrous bone to the hiatus Fallopii, where it divides into two filaments. One of these filaments enters the hiatus and joins the intumescentia gangliformis of the facial; the other passes to a minute foramen nearer the base of the pe- trous bone, and enters the tjrrnpanum, where it communicates with a branch of Jacobson's nerve. The Submaxillary ganglion is a small round or triangular ganglion situated on the submaxillary gland, in close relation with the gustatory nerve, and near the posterior border of the mylo- hyoideus muscle. Its branches of distribution, six or eight in number, divide into many filaments, which supply the side of the tongue, the submax- illary gland, sublingual gland, and Wliarton's duct. Its branches of communication are, two or three from and to the gustatory nerve ; one from the chorda tympani; two or three which form a plexus with branches of the hypoglossal nerve; and one or two filaments which pass to the facial artery, and communicate with the nervi moUes from the cervical portion of the sympathetic. Carotid plexus.—The ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion enters the carotid canal with the internal carotid artery, and divides into two branches, which forms several loops of commu- nication with each other around the artery. These branches, toge- ther mth those derived from the petrosal branch of the Vidian, * Frederick Ai'uold, "Dissertatio Inauguralis de Parte Cephalica JTervi Svmpathetici." Heidelberg, 1836; and " Ueber den Ohrknoteu," 1828.513 CERVICAL aANGfilA. constitute the carotid plexus. They also form frequently a small gangliform swelling on the under part of the artery, which is called the carotid ganglion. The latter, however, is not constant. The continuation of the carotid plexus onwards with the artery by the side of the sella turcica, is the cavernous plexus. The carotid plexus is the centre of communication between all the cranial ganglia, and, being derived from the superior cervical gan- glion, between the cranial ganglia and those of the trunk: it also communicates with the greater part of the cerebral nerves, and dis- tributes filaments with each of the branches of the internal carotid, which accompany those branches in all their ramifications. The branches which accompany the anterior cerebral artery at each side unite upon the anterior communicating artery, and according to Ribes form a small ganglion, the ganglion of Ribes. The existence of this ganglion is disputed. The ophthalmic ganglion communicates with the plexus by means of the long branch which reaches it from the cavernous plexus. The spheno-palatine joins the plexus by means of the carotid branch of the Vidian. The submaxillary ganglion is brought into connexion with it by means of the otic ganglion, and the otic ganglion by means of the tympanic nerve and the Vidian. It communicates with the third nerve in the cavernous sinus, and through the ophthalmic ganglion; frequently with the fourth in the formation of the nerve of the tentorium; with the Casserian gan- glion ; with the ophthalmic division of the fifth in the cavernous sinus, and by means of the ophthalmic ganglion; with the superior maxillary, through the spheno-palatine ganglion; and with the in- ferior maxillary, through the otic ganglion. It sends two branches directly to the sixth nerve, which unite'^ with it as it crosses the cavernous sinus; it communicates with the facial and auditory nerve, through the medium of the petrosal branch of the Vidian; and with the glosso-pharyngeal by means of two filaments to the tympanic nerve. CERVICAL PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. The superior cervical ganglion is long and fusiform, of a reddish- grey colour, smooth, and of considerable thickness, extending from within an inch of the carotid foramen in the petrous bone to opposite the lower border of the third cervical vertebra. It is in relation, in front, with the sheath of the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein ; and, behind, with the rectus anticus major muscle. Its branches are divisible into superior, inferior, external, and in- ternal; to which mrybe added, as proper to this ganglion, anterior. The superior (carotid nerve) is a single branch which ascends by * Panizza, in Ms " Experimental Eesearches on the Nerves," denies this communication, and states very vaguely that "they are merely lost and en- twined around it."—Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, Jan. 1836.514 CERVICAL GANGLIA. the side of the internal carotid, and divides into two branches; one lying to the outer, the other to the inner side of that vessel. The two branches enter the carotid canal, and, by their communications with each other and with the petrosal branch of the Vidian, consti- tute the carotid plexus. The inferior or descending branch, sometimes two, is the cord of communication with the middle cervical ganglion. The external branches are numerous, and may be divided into two sets; those which communicate with the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumo- gastric, and hypoglossal nerve; and those which communicate with the first four cervical nerves. The internal branches are three in number; pharyngeal, to assist in forming the pharyngeal plexus; laryngeal, to join the superior laryngeal nerve and its branches; and the supenor cardiac nerve, or nervus superficialis cordis. The anterior branches accompany the external carotid artery with its branches, around which they form plexuses, and here and there small ganglia; they are named, from the softness of their texture, 7iervi molles, and from their reddish hue, nervi subrufi. The branches accompanying the facial artery are conducted by that vessel to the submaxillary ganglion, and those which accompany the in- ternal maxillary artery reach the otic ganglion through the medium of the arteria meningea media. The Middle cervical ganglion (thyroid ganglion) is of small size, and sometimes altogether wanting. It is situated opposite the fifth cervical vertebra, and rests agaiast the inferior thyroid artery. This relation is so constant, as to have induced Haller to name it the "thyroid ganglion." Its superior branch, or branches, ascend to communicate with the superior cervical ganglion. Its inferior branches descend to join the inferior cervical ganglion; one of these frequently passes in front of the subclavian artery, the other behind it. Its external branches communicate with the fifth and sixth cervi- cal nerves. Its internal branches are filaments which acompany the inferior thyi'oid artery, the inferior thyroid plexus; and the middle cardiac nerve, nervus cardiacus magnus. The Inferior cervical ganglion (vertebral ganglion) is much larger than the preceding, and is constant in its existence. It is of a semilunar form, and situated on the base of the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, immediately behind the vertebral arteiy; hence its designation ^''vertebral ganglion.'''' Its superior branches communicate with the middle cervical ganglion. The inferior branches pass some before and some behind the sub- clavian artery, to join the first thoracic ganglion.CAKDIAC NEEVES. 515 The external branches consist of two sets; one which, communicates with the sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical, and first dorsal nerve, and one which accompanies the vertebral artery along the vertebral canal, forming the vertebral plexus. This plexus sends filaments to all the branches given off by the artery, and communicates in the cranium with the filaments of the carotid plexus accompanying the branches of the internal carotid artery. The internal branch is the inferior cardiac nerve, nervus cardi- acus minor. Cakdiac nerves."—The cardiac nerves are three in number on each side, namely, superior, middle, and inferior. The Superior cardiac nerve {nervus swperficialis cordis) arises from the lower part of the superior cervical ganglion; it descends the neck behind the common carotid artery and parallel with the trachea, crosses the inferior thyroid artery, and running by the side of the recurrent laryngeal nerve enters the chest. The nerve of the right side passes either in front of or behind the subclavian artery and along the posterior aspect of the arteria innominata to the deep cardiac plexus. The left superior cardiac nerve runs by the side of the left carotid artery, and crosses the arch of the aorta to the superficial cardiac plexus. in its course it receives branches from the pneumogastric nerve, and sends filaments to the thyroid gland and trachea. The Middle cardiac nerve {nervus cardiacus magnus) proceeds from the middle cervical ganglion, or, in its absence, from the cord of communication between the superior and inferior ganglion. It is the largest of the three nerves, and lies parallel with the recurrent laryngeal. At the root of the neck it divides into several branches, which pass some before and some behind the subclavian artery, communicates with the superior and inferior cardiac, pneumogastric and recurrent nerve, and descends to the bifurcation of the trachea, to join the deep cardiac plexus. The Inferior cardiac nerve {nervus cardiacus minor) arises from the inferior cervical ganglion, communicates with the recurrent laryngeal and middle cardiac nerve, and descends to the front of the bifurcation of the trachea, to the deep cardiac plexus. The Superficial cardiac plexus is situated immediately beneath the arch of the aorta and in front of the right pulmonary artery. It receives the superior cardiac nerve of the left side and the in- ferior cardiac branch of the left pneumogastric nerve, both of which cross the arch of the aorta between the left phrenic and pneumo- gastric nerve. It receives besides several filaments from the deep cardiac plexus, and sometimes a cardiac branch from the right pneumogastric nerve. Connected with the plexus is a small gan- glion (sometimes wanting), the cardiac ganglion of Wrisberg, which lies close to the right side of the fibrous cord of the ductus arteri- osus. The superficial cardiac plexus gives off filaments which pass516 CAEBIAC PLEXUS. along the front of the left pulmonary artery to the root of the left lung, where they communicate with the anterior pulmonary plexus; while the principal part of the plexus descends in the groove between the pulmonary artery and the aorta to the anterior longitudinal sulcus of the heart, where it comes into relation with the anterior coronary artery, and becomes the anterior coronary plexus. At the base of the heart, the anterior coronary plexus receives several filaments from the deep cardiac plexus. Its branches are distributed to the substance of the heart in the course of the left or anterior coronary artery. The Deep or Gtreat cardiac plexus is situated on the bifur- cation of the trachea, above the right pulmonary artery and behind the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta. It receives, on the right side, the three cardiac nerves of the sympathetic of the same side, and the cardiac branches of the right pneumogastric and right recurrent nerve. On the left side it receives the middle and infe- rior cardiac nerves of the sympathetic of the left side; the cardiac branches of the left pneumogastric (excepting the inferior), and several cardiac branches from the left recurrent nerve. In other words, it receives all the cardiac filaments of the sympathetic, pneu- mogastric, and recurrent nerves, with the exception of the left supe- rior cardiac of the sympathetic (nervus superficialis cordis) and the inferior cervical cardiac of the left pneumogastric, these two nerves being destined to the superficial cardiac plexus. The branches of the deep cardiac plexus, proceeding from its right and left division, pass downwardsto join the coronary arteries, and outwards to the pulmonary plexuses. From the right division of the plexus the branches proceed before and behind the right pulmonary artery. Those which pass in front descend upon the trunk of the pulmonary artery to the left coro- nary artery, and help to form the anterior coronary plexus; those which pass behind the right pulmonary artery are distributed to the right auricle; a third set of filaments, proceeding from the right division of the deep cardiac plexus, follow the course of the right pulmonary artery to the anterior pulmonary plexus. From the left division of the plexus branches proceed beneath the arch of the aorta immediately to the right of the ligament of the ductus arteriosus to join the superficial cardiac plexus; others pass outwards with the pulmonary artery to the pulmonary plexus; a few descend to the left auricle; but the chief bulk pass on to the right coronary artery and form the posterior coronary plexus. The A nterior coronary plexus proceeds from the superficial car- diac plexus, and receives other filaments from the deep cardiac plexus. It is distributed with the branches of the coronary artery on the anterior aspect of the heart. The Posterior coronary plexus proceeds from the deep cardiac plexus and principally from its left division. It follows the course of the arteries distributed to the posterior aspect of the heart.517 THORACIC PORTION OP THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. The thoracic portion of the sympathetic nerve is the trunk of the sympathetic in its course through the cavity of the thorax. It lies by the side of the vertebral column upon the heads of the ribs and intercostal spaces; but at its lowest part comes into relation with the sides of the bodies of the last two dorsal vertebrse. The Thoracic ganglia are twelve in number on each side. They are flattened and triangular, or irregular in form, and present the peculiar reddish grey colour and pearly lustre of the sympathetic ganglia in general; they rest against the heads of the ribs, and are covered by the pleura costalis. The first two ganglia and the last are usually the largest; the latter being situated upon the side of the body of the last dorsal vertebra. Their branches are branches of communication and branches of distribution. Some ascending filaments from the first ganglion assist in the formation of the vertebral plexus. The external or communicating branches, two or three in number for each ganglion, communicate with the intercostal nerves. The internal or visceral branches arising from the five or six upper ganglia, are of a small size, and distributed to the aorta, oesophagus, vertebral column, and lungs. The branches to the lungs proceed from the third and fourth ganglia, and go to join the poste- rior pulmonary plexus. The visceral branches of the six lower ganglia unite to form the three splanchnic nerves. The Great splanchnic nerve proceeds from the sixth dorsal gan- glion, and receiving the branches of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, passes downwards upon the front of the vertebral column, and, piercing the crus of the diaphragm, terminates in the semi- lunar ganglion. The Lesser splanchnic nerve is formed by filaments which issue from the tenth and eleventh ganglia; it pierces the crus of the dia- phragm, and joins the solar plexus near the middle line. The Third or renal splanchnic nerve proceeds from the last tho- racic ganglion, and, piercing the diaphragm, terminates in the renal plexus. When absent, the place of this nerve is supplied by the lesser splanchnic. The Semilunar ganglion is a large, irregular, gangliform body, pierced by numerous openings, and appearing like the aggregation of a number of smaller ganglia, having spaces between them. It is situated by the side of the cceliac axis and root of the superior mesenteric artery, and extends outwards to the supra-renal capsule. The ganglia communicate both above and below the coeliac axis and form a gangliform circle, from which branches pass off in all direc- tions, like rays from a centre. Hence the entire circle has been named the solar plexus. The Solar or epigastric plexus receives the great and lesser518 ABDOMINAL PLEXUS. splanchnic nerves; the termination of the right pneumogastric nerve; some branches from the right phrenic nerve; and sometimes one or two filaments from the left. It sends forth numerous fila- ments which accompany, under the name of plexuses, all the branches given off by the abdominal aorta. Thus we have, derived from the solar plexus, the— Phrenic, or diaphragmatic Renal plexuses. Supra-renal plexuses, In connexion with the phrenic plexus of the right side, there is described a small ganglion cliaphragmaticum, which is situated near the supra-renal capsule. In this ganglion branches of the right phrenic nerve communicate with those of the sympathetic. The Supra-renal plexuses are remarkable for their large size, and for a ganglion, which has received the name of ganglion supra-renale. The Renal plexuses are also large, and receive the third splanchnic nerve. The Superior mesenteric plexus has several small ganglia at the root of the artery ; and its nerves, which are whiter than those of the other plexuses, form a kind of nervous.sheath to the artery and its branches. The Aortic plexus is a continuation of the solar plexus down- wards on the aorta, for the supply of the inferior branches of that trunk; it receives also branches from the renal plexuses and from the lumbar ganglia. It is the source or origin of the inferior mesen- teric plexus and part of the spermatic plexus, and terminates be- low in the hypogastric plexus. It likewise distributes branches on the inferior vena cava. The Spermatic p>lexus is derived from the renal plexus, but re- ceives filaments from the aortic plexus. Tlie Inferior mesenteric plexus is derived chiefly from the aortic plexus. The lumbar portion of the trunk of the sympathetic is situated on the vertebral column, close to the anterior border of the psoas mag- nus muscle. It is continuous above, under the edge of the diaphragm, with the thoracic portion of the nerve, and below it descends upon the sacrum, in front of the anterior sacral foramina, to the coccyx. It presents four small ganglia and an intermediate cord. The Lumbar ganglia, four in niimber at each side, of a pearly grey colour and fusiform shape, are situated on the anterior part of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae. plexuses. Gastric plexus. Hepatic plexus. Splenic plexus. Superior mesenteric plexus. Aortic plexus. Spermatic plexuses. Inferior mesenteric plexus. LUMBAR PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE.HYPOGASTRIC PLEXUS. 519 The branches of the lumbar ganglia are branches of communica- tion and branches of distribution. The external or communicating branches, two or three in number, and longer than in the other regions, communicate with the lumbar nerves. The internal or visceral branches consist of two sets ; of which the upper pass inwards in front of the abdominal aorta, and join the aortic j^lexiis; the lower branches cross the common iliac arteries, and unite over the promontory of the sacrum, to form the hypogastric plexus. The Hypogastric plexus is formed by the termination of the aortic plexus, and by the union of branches from the lower lumbar ganglia. It is situated over the promontory of the sacrum, between the two common iliac arteries, and bifurcates inferiorly into two lateral portions, inferior hypogastric plexuses, which communicate with branches from the third and fourth sacral nerves. It distributes branches to all the viscera of the pelvis, and sends filaments which accompany the branches of the internal iliac artery. SACRAL PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. j ■) , The Sacral ganglia are four or five in number on each side. They are situated upon the sacrum, close to the anterior sacral foramina, and resemble the lumbar ganglia in form and mode of connexion, although much smaller in size. The external or communicating branches are two from each ganglion, which pass outwards to communicate with the anterior sacral nerves and with the coccygeal nerve. The internal or visceral branches communicate very freely with the inferior hypogastric plexuses, and are distributed to the pelvic viscera. The last pair of sacral ganglia give off branches which join a small ganglion, situated on the first bone of the coccyx, called the ganglion impar, or azygos. This ganglion serves to connect the ex- tremities of the two sympathetic nerves. It gives off a few small branches to the coccyx and rectum ; and communicates with the coccygeal nerve.520 CHAPTER IX. ORGANS OF SENSE. The organs of sense, tlie instruments by wMcli the animal frame is brought into relation with surrounding nature, are five in number. Four of these organs are situated within the head : viz. the appa- ratus of smell, sight, hearing, and taste ; and the remaining organ, of touch, is resident in the skin, and distributed over the surface of the body. THE NOSE AND NASAL EOSS^. The organ of smell consists essentially of two parts : one external, the nose ; the other internal, the nasal fossce. The nose is the triangular pyramid which projects from the centre of the face, immediately above the upper lip. Superiorly it is con- nected with the forehead by means of a narrow bridge ; inferiorly, it presents two openings, the nostrils, which overhang the mouth, and are so constructed that the odour of all substances must be received by the nose before they can be introduced within the lips. The sep- tum between the openings of the nostrils is called the columna. Their entrance is guarded by a number of stiff hairs {vibrisscB) which project across the openings, and act as a filter in preventing the in- troduction of foreign substances, such as dust or insects, with the current of air intended for respiration. The anatomical elements of which the nose is composed, are —1. Integument. 2. Muscles. 3. Bones. 4. Fibro-cartilages. 5. Mucous membrane. 6. Vessels and nerves. 1. The Integument forming the tip (lohulus) and wings (alcB) of the nose is extremely thick and dense, so as to be with difficulty se- parated from the fibre-cartilage. It is furnished with an abundance of sehiparous follicles, which, by their oily secretion, protect the ex- tremity of the nose in excessive alternations of temperature. The sebaceous matter of these follicles becomes of a dark colour near the surface, from altered secretion, and also from attraction of the car- bonaceous matter floating in the atmosphere; hence the spotted ap- pearance which the tip of the nose presents in large cities. When the integument is firmly compressed, the inspissated sebaceous se-521 CARTILAGES OF THE NOSE. cretion is squeezed out from the follicles, and taking the cylindrical form of their excretory ducts, has the appearance of small white maggots (grubs ; comedones) with black heads. 2. The Muscles are brought into view by reflecting the integu- ment ; they are the pyramidalis nasi, compressor nasi, dilatator naris, levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and depressor alse nasi. They have been already described with the muscles of the face. 3. The Bones of the nose are, the nasal, and nasal processes of the superior maxillary. 4. The Fibro-cartilages give form and stability to the nose, pro- viding, at the same time, by their elasticity, against injuries. They are five in number, namely, the— Fibro-cartilage of the septum. Two lateral fibro-cartilages, Two alar fibro-cartilages. The Fibro-cartilage of the septum, somewhat triangular in form, divides the nose into its two nostrils. It is connected above with the nasal bones and lateral fibro-cartilages; behind, with the ethmoidal septum and vomer; and below, with the palate processes of the su- perior maxillary bones. The alar fibro-cartilages and columna move freely upon the fibro-cartilage of the septum, being but loosely con- nected with it by perichondrium. The Lateral fihro-cartilages are also triangular; they are connected, Fig. 176.* in front, with the fibro-cartilage of the septum ; above, with the nasal bones; behind, with the nasal pro- cesses of the superior maxillary bones; and belovj, with the aJar fibro-cartilages. Alar fibro-cartilages.—Each of these cartilages is curved so as to correspond with the walls of the nostril, to which it forms a kind of rim. The inner portion is loosely connected with the same part of the opposite cartilage, to form the columna. It is expanded and thickened at the point of the nose, to constitute the lobe; and on the side makes a curve corresponding with that of the ala. This curve * The fibro-cartilages of tlie nose. 1.

The whole of these fibro- cartilages are connected with each other, and to the bones, by perichondrium, which, from its membranous struc- ture, permits of the freedom of motion existing between them. 5. The Mucous membrane lining the interior of the nose, is continuous with the skin externally, and with the pituitary membrane of the nasal fossse within. Around the entrance of the nostrils it is provided with the vi- brissce. 6. Vessels and Nerves.— The Arteries of the nose are the lateralis nasi from the facial, and the nasalis septi from the superior coronary. Its Nerves are, the facial, infra-orbital, and nasal branch of the ophthalmic. NASAL POSS^. To obtain a good view of the nasal fossce, the face must be divided through the nose by a vertical incision, a little to one side of the middle line. The Nasal fossce are two irregular, compressed cavities, extending backwards from the nose to the pharynx. They are bounded su- jieriorly by the lateral cartilage of the nose, and by the nasal, ethmoid, and sphenoid bone ; inferiorly by the hard palate ; and, in the middle line, they are separated by a bony and fibro-cartila- ginous septum. A plan of the boundaries of the nasal fossae will be found at page 65. Upon the outer wall of each fossa, in the dried skull, are three * The fibro-cartilages and bones of the nose viewed from the side. After Arnold. 1. Nasal bone. 2.

In the fresh fossse these are covered with mucous membrane, and serve to increase the surface of that membrane by their prominence and convoluted form. The space intervening between the superior and middle spongy bone is the superior meatus ; the space between the middle and inferior the middle meatus ; and that between the inferior and the floor of the fossa the inferior meatus. These meatuses are passages which extend from before backwards, and it is in circulating through and amongst these that the atmo- sphere deposits its odorant particles upon the mucous membrane. There are several openings into the nasal fossse: thus, in the su- perior meatus are the openings of the sphenoidal and posterior eth- moidal cells ; in the middle, the anterior ethmoidal cells, frontal sinuses, and antrum maxillare ; and, in the inferior meatus, the termination of the nasal duct. In the dried bone there are two additional openings, the spheno-palatine and the anterior palatine foramen ; the former being situated in the superior, the latter in the inferior meatus. The Mucous membrane of the nasal fossee is called pituitary, or Sclmeiderian.^ The former name being derived from the nature of its secretion, the latter from Schneider, who was the first to show that the secretion of the nose proceeded from the mucous membrane, and not from the brain, as was previously imagined. It is closely adherent to the periosteum, constituting what is called a fibro- mucous membrane, and is continuous with the general gastro-pul- monary mucous membrane. From the nasal fossae it may be traced through the openings in the meatuses, into the sphenoidal and eth- moidal cells; into the frontal sinuses ; into the antrum maxillare ; through the nasal duct to the surface of the eye, where it is conti- nuous with the conjunctiva; along the Eustachian tubes into the tympanum and mastoid cells, to which it forms the lining mem- brane ; and through the posterior nares into the pharynx and mouth, and thence through the lungs and alimentary canal. The surface of the membrane is furnished with a laminated epithelium near the apertures of the nares, and in the rest of its extent with a columnar epithelium supporting innumerable vibratile cilia. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the nasal fossae are the anterior and posterior ethmoidal, from the ophthalmic artery ; and the spheno-palatine and pterygo-palatine from the internal maxillary. The Nerves are, the olfactory, the spheno-palatine and naso- palatine from Meckel's ganglion, and the nasal branch of the oph- thalmic. The ultimate filaments of the olfactory nerve terminate in papillae. * Conrad Victor Schneider, Professor of Medicine at Wittenberg. His work, entitled Be Cattarhis, &e. was published in 1661.524 THE EYE, WITH ITS APPENDAGES. The form of the eyeball is that of a sphere, of about one inch in diameter, having the segment of a smaller sphere engrafted upon its anterior surface, which increases its antero-posterior diameter. The axes of the two eyeballs are parallel with each other, but do not correspond with the axes of the orbits, which are directed outwards. The optic nerves follow the direction of the orbits, and therefore enter the eyeballs on their nasal side. The Grlobe of the eye is composed of tunics, and of refracting .media called hwmours. The tunics are three in number, the First tunic.—The Sclerotic and Cornea form the external tunic of the eyeball, and give it its peculiar form. Four-fifths of the globe are invested by the sclerotic, the remaining fifth by the cornea. The Sclerotic {(jK\r)pbg, hard) is a dense fibrous membrane, thicker behind than in front. It is continuous, posteriorly, with the sheath of the optic nerve, which is derived from the dura mater, and is pierced by that nerve as well as by the ciliary nerves and arteries. Anteriorly it presents a bevelled edge, which receives the cornea in the same way that a watch-glass is received by the groove in its case. Its anterior surface is covered by a thin tendinous layer, the tunica albuginea, derived from the expansion of the tendons of the four recti muscles. By its posterior surface it gives attachment to the two oblique muscles. The tunica albuginea is covered, for a part of its extent, by the mucous membrane of the front of the eye, the con- junctiva ; and, by reason of the brilliancy of its whiteness, gives occasion to the common expression, "the white of the eye." At the entrance of the optic nerve, the sclerotic forms a thin cribriform lamella {lamina cribrosa), which is pierced by a number of minute openings for the passage of the nervous filaments. One of these openings, larger than the rest, and situated in the centre of the lamella, is the porus opticus, through which the arteria centralis retinae enters the eyeball. The Oornea (corneus, homy) is the transparent projecting layer that constitutes the anterior fifth of the globe of the eye. In its form it is circular, concavo-convex, and resembles a watch-glass. It is received by its edge, which is sharp and thin, within the bevelled 1. Sclerotic and Cornea, 2. Choroid, Iris, and Ciliary processes, 3. Retina and Zonula ciliaris.

When examined from the exterior, its vertical diameter is seen to be about one-sixteenth shorter than the transverse, in consequence of the overlapping above and below of the margin of the sclerotica; on the interior, however, its outline is perfectly circular. The cornea is composed of four layers : namely, the conjunctiva; the cornea proper, which consists of several thin lamellae connected together by an extremely fine cellular tissue; the cornea elastica, a '' fine, elastic, and exquisitely transparent membrane, exactly applied to the inner surface of the cornea proper" ; and the lining mem- brane of the anterior chamber of the eyeball. The cornea elastica is remarkable for its perfect transparency, even when submitted for many days to the action of water or alcohol; while the cornea proper Fig. 178.* * Longitudinal section of the globe of the eye. 1.

To expose this mem- brane, Dr. Jacob suggests that the eye should be placed in water for six or eight days, and then, that all the opaque cornea should be removed layer after layer. Another character of the cornea elastica is its great elasticity, which causes it to roll up when divided or torn, in the same manner as the capsule of the lens. The use of this layer, according to Dr. Jacob, is to "preserve the requisite perma- nent correct curvature of the flaccid cornea proper." The opacity of the cornea, produced by pressure on the globe, results from the infiltration of fluid into the cellular tissue connect- ing its layers. This appearance cannot be produced in a sound living eye, although a small quantity of serous fluid (liquor cornese) is said to occupy the areolae of the cellular tissue. Dissection.—The sclerotic and cornea are now to be dissected away from the second tunic; this, with care, may be easily performed, the only firm connexions subsisting between them being at the circum- ference of the iris, the entrance of the optic nerve, and the perfora- tion of the ciliary nerves and arteries. Pinch up a fold of the sclerotic near its anterior circumference, and make a small opening through it, then raise the edge of the tunic, and with a pair of fine scissors, having a probe point, divide the entire circumference of the sclerotic, and cut it away bit by bit. Then separate it from its at- . tachment around the circumference of the iris by a gentle pressure with the edge of the knife. The dissection of the eye must be conducted under water. In the course of this dissection, the ciliary nerves and long ciliary arteries will be seen passing forwards between the sclerotic and choroid, to be distributed to the iris. Second tunic.—The second tunic of the eyeball is formed by the choroid, ciliary ligament, and iris, the ciliary processes being an appendage developed from its inner surface. The Choroid^' is a vascular membrane of a rich chocolate-brown colour upon its external surface, and of a deep black colour within. It is connected to the sclerotic externally, by an extremely fine cellular tissue (membrana fusca), and by nerves and vessels. Internally it is in simple contact with the third tunic of the eye, the retina. It is pierced posteriorly for the passage of the optic nerve, and is connected anteriorly with the iris, ciliary processes, and with * The word choroid has been very much abused in anatomical language; it was originally applied to the membrane of the foetus called chorion, from the Greek word xopi-ov domiciUum, that membrane being, as it were, the abode or receptacle of the foetus. Xopiov comes from x^^P^^^ to take or receive. Now it so happens that the chorion in the ovum is a vascular mem- brane of peculiar structure. Hence the term choroid, ^opiov etfios like the chorion, has been used indiscriminately to signify vascular structures, as in the choroid membrane of the eye, the choroid plexus, &c., and we find Cru- veUhier, in his work on Anatomy, vol. iii. p. 463, saying in a note, " Choroide est synonyme de vasculeuse."CHOROID COAT. 527 the line of junction of the cornea and sclerotic, by a dense white structure, the ciliary ligament, which surrounds the circumference of the iris like a ring. The choroid membrane is composed of three layers :—an external or venous layer, which consists principally of veins arranged in a peculiar manner : hence they have been named vence vorticosce. The marking on the surface of the membrane produced by these veins resembles so many centres to which a number of curved lines converge. It is this layer which is connected with the ciliary liga- ment. The middle or arterial layer (tunica Ruyschiana)* is formed principally by the ramifications of minute arteries. It is reflected inwards at its junction with the ciliary ligament, so as to form the ciliary processes. The internal layer is a delicate membrane (membrana -pigmenti) composed of several laminse of nucleated hexagonal cells, which contain the granules of pigmentum nigrum, and are arranged so as to resemble a tesselated pavement.

The Ciliary ligament, or circle (annnlus albidns), is the bond of union between the external and middle tunic of the eyeball, and serves to connect the cornea and sclerotic, at their line of junction, with the iris and external layer of the choroid. It is also the point to which the ciliary nerves and vessels proceed previously to their distribution, and it receives the anterior ciliary arteries through the anterior margin of the sclerotic. A minute vascular canal is situated within the ciliary ligament, called the ciliary canal, or the canal of Fontana,* from its discoverer. The Iris (iris, a rainbow) is so named from its variety of colour in different individuals : it forms a septum between the anterior and posterior chamber of the eye, and is pierced somewhat to the nasal side of its centre by a circular opening, which is called the pupil. By its periphery it is connected with the ciliary ligament, and by its inner circumference forms the margin of the pupil; its anterior surface looks towards the cornea, the posterior towards the ciliary processes and lens. The iris is composed of two layers, an anterior or muscular, con- sisting of radiating fibres which converge from the circumference towards the centre, and have the power of dilating the pupil; and circular, which surround the pupil like a sphincter, and by their action produce contraction of its area. The posterior layer is of a deep purple tint, and is thence named uvea, from its resemblance in colour to a ripe grape. The Ciliary processes (corpus ciliare) may be seen in two ways, either by removing the iris from its attachment to the ciliary liga- ment, when a front view of the processes will be obtained, or by making a transverse section through the globe of the eye, when they may be examined from behind, as in Fig. 180. • They consist of a number of triangular folds, formed apparently by the plaiting of the middle and internal layer of the choroid. Ac- cording to Zinn, they are about sixty in number, and may be divided into large and small, the latter being situated in the spaces between the former. Their periphery is connected with the ciliary ligament, and is continuous with the middle and internal layer of the choroid. The central border is free, and rests against the circumference of the lens. The anterior surface corresponds with the uvea; the posterior receives the folds of the zonula ciliaris between its processes, and thus establishes a connexion between the choroid and the third tunic of the eye. The ciliary processes are covered with a thick layer of pigmentxim nigrum, which is more abundant upon them, and upon the anterior part of the choroid, than upon the posterior part of the * Felix Fontana, an anatomist of Tuscany.

Wlien the pigment is washed off, the processes are of a whitish colour. Third tunic.—The third tunic of the eye is the retina, which is prolonged forwards to the lens by the zonula ciliaris. Dissection.—If, after the preceding dissection, the choroid mem- brane be carefully raised and removed, the eye being kept under water, the retina may be seen very distinctly. The Retina is composed of three layers :— JacoVs membrane is extremely thin, and is seen as a mere film when the freshly dissected eye is suspended in water. Examined by the microscope, it is found to be composed of cells having a tesselated arrangement. Dr. Jacob considers it to be a serous membrane. The Nervous membrane is the expansion of the optic nerve, and forms a thin semi-transparent bluish-white layer, which envelopes the vitreous humour, and extends forward to the commencement of the ciliary processes, where it terminates by an abrupt scalloped margin. According to Treviranus, this layer is composed of cylindrical fibres, * Anterior segment of a transverse section of the globe of the eye, seen from within. 1.

M MKETINA.—ZONULA CILIARIS. 530 which proceed from the optic nerve, and, near their termination, bend abruptly inwards, to form the internal papillary layer, which lies in contact with the hyaloid membrane; each fibre constituting by its extremity a distinct papilla. The Vascular membrane consists of the ramifications of a minute artery, the arteria centralis retinas, and its accompanying vein ; the artery pierces the optic nerve, and enters the globe of the eye through the porus opticus, in the centre of the lamina cribrosa. This artery may be seen by making a transverse section of the eyeball. Its branches are continued anteriorly into the zonula ciliaris. The vascular layer forms distinct sheaths for the nervous papillae, which constitute the inner surface of the retina. In the centre of the posterior part of the globe of the eye the retina presents a circular spot, which is called the foramen of Soemmering;* it is surrounded by a yellow halo, the limbus luteus, and is frequently obscured by an elliptical fold of the retina, which has been regarded as a normal condition of the membrane. The term foramen is mis- applied to this spot, for the vascular layer and the membrana Jacobi are continued across it; the nervous substance alone appearing to be deficient. It exists only in animals having the axes of the eyeballs parallel with each other, as man, quadrumana, and some saurian reptiles, and is said to give passage to a small lymphatic vessel. The Zonula ciliaris (zonula of Zinn)f is a thin vascular layer, which connects the anterior margin of the retina with the anterior surface of the lens, near its circumference. It presents upon its sur- face a number of small folds corresponding with the ciliary processes, between which they are received. These processes are arranged in the form of rays around the lens, and the spaces between them are stained by the pigmentum nigrum of the ciliary processes. They derive their vessels from the vascular layer of the retina. The under surface of the zonula is in contact with the hyaloid membrane, and around the lens forms the anterior fluted wall of the canal of Petit. The connexion between these folds and the ciliary processes may be demonstrated by dividing an eye transversely into two portions, then raising the anterior half, and allowing the vitreous humour to separate from its attachment by its own weight. The folds of the zonula will then be seen to be drawn out from between the folds of the ciliary processes. Humours.—The Aqueous humour is situated in the anterior and posterior chamber of the eye ; it is a weakly albuminous fluid, with * Samuel Thomas Soemmering is celebrated for the beautiful and accurate plates which accompany his works.

According to Petit, it scarcely exceeds four or five grains in weight. The anterior chamber is the space intervening between the cornea in front, and the iris and pupil behind. The j^osterior chamber is the narrow space less than half a line in depth,* bounded by the posterior surface of the iris and pupil in front, and by the ciliary processes, zonula ciliaris, and lens behind. The two chambers are lined by a thin layer, the secreting membrane of the aqueous humour. Mg. 181.t The Vitreous humour forms, the principal bulk of the globe of the eye. It is an albuminous and highly transparent fluid, enclosed in a delicate membrane, the hyaloid. From the inner surface of this membrane, numerous thin lamellae are directed inwards, and form compartments in which the fluid is contained. According to Hann- over, these lamella have a radiated arrangement, like those on the transverse section of an orange, and are about 180 in number. In the centre of the vitreous humour is a tubular canal, through which a minute artery is conducted from the arteria centralis retinas to * Winslow and Lieutaud thought the iris to be in contact with the lens; it frequently adheres to the capsule of the latter in iritis.

This vessel is injected without difficulty in the foetus. The Crystalline humour or lens is situated immediately behind the pupil, and surrounded by the ciliary processes, which slightly overlap its margin. It is more convex on the posterior than on the anterior surface, and is embedded in the anterior part of the vitreous humour, from which it is separated by the hyaloid membrane. It is invested by a peculiarly transparent and elastic membrane, the capsule of the lens, which contains a small quantity of fluid, called liquor Morgagni,* and is retained in its place by the attachment of the zonula ciliaris. Dr. Jacob is of opinion that the lens is con- nected to its capsule by means of cellular tissue, and that the liquor Morgagni is the result of a cadaveric change. The lens consists of concentric layers, of which the external are soft, the next firmer, and the central form a hardened nucleus. These layers are best demonstrated by boiling, or by immersion in alcohol, when they separate easily from each other. Another division of the lens takes place at the same time: it splits into three triangu- lar segments, which have the sharp edge directed towards the centre, and the base towards the circumference. The concentric lamellse are composed of minute parallel fibres, which are united with each other by means of scalloped borders, the convexity of one border fitting the concave scallop of the other. Immediately around the circumference of the lens is a triangular canal, the canal of Petit, f about a line and a half in breadth. It is bounded, in front, by the flutings of the zonula ciliaris ; behind, by the hyaloid membrane ; and within, by the border of the lens. Vessels and nerves.—The Vessels of the globe of the eye are the long and short, and anterior ciliary arteries, and the arteria cen- tralis retinas. The long ciliary arteries, two in number, pierce the posterior part of the sclerotic, and pass forward on each side, be- tween that membrane and the choroid, to the ciliary ligament, where each divides into two branches, which are distributed to the iris. The short ciliary arteries pierce the posterior part of the sclerotic coat, and are distributed to the middle layer of the choroid mem- brane. The anterior ciliary are branches of the muscular arteries. They enter the eye through the anterior part of the sclerotic, and are distributed to the iris. It is the increased number of these latter arteries, in iritis, that gives rise to the peculiar red zone around the circumference of the cornea which accompanies that disease. The Arteria centralis retince enters the optic nerve at about half * John Baptist Morgagni was born in 1682.

The Nerves of the eyeball are, the optic, two ciliary nerves from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, and the ciliary nerves from the ophthalmic ganglion. Observations.—The sclerotic is a tunic of protection, and the cornea a medium for the transmission of light. The choroid supports the vessels destined for the nutrition of the eye, and by its pigmentum nigrum absorbs all loose and scattered rays that might confuse the image impressed upon the retina. The iris, by means of its powers of expansion and contraction, regulates the quantity of light admitted through the pupil. If the iris be thin, and the rays of light pass through its substance, they are immediately absorbed by the uvea ; and if that layer be insufficient, they are taken up by the black pig- ment of the ciliary processes. In Albinoes, where there is an ab- sence of pigmentum nigrum, the rays of light traverse the iris, and even the sclerotic, and so overwhelm the eye with light, that sight is destroyed, except in the dimness of evening or at night. In the manufacture of optical instruments, care is taken to colour their interior black, with the same object, the absorption of scattered rays. The transparent lamellated cornea and the humours of the eye have for their office the refraction of the rays in such proportion as to direct the image in the most favourable manner upon the retina. Where the refracting medium is too great, as in over convexity of the cornea and lens, the image falls short of the retina (myopia, near-sightedness); and where it is too little, the image is thrown beyond the nervous membrane (presbyopia, far-sightedness). These conditions are rectified by the use of spectacles, which provide a differently refracting medium externally to the eye, and thereby correct the transmission of light. APPENDAGES OF THE EYE. The Appendages of the Eye [tutamina oculi) are, the eyebrows, eyelids, eyelashes, conjunctiva, caruncula lachrymalis, and the lachrymal apparatus. The Eyebrows {supercilia) are two projecting arches of integument covered with short thick hairs, which form the upper boundary of the orbits. They are connected beneath with the orbiculares, occipito- frontales, and corrugatores superciliorum muscles ; their use is to shade the eyes from too vivid a light, or protect them from particles of dust and moisture floating over the forehead. The Eyelids (palpebrce) are two valvular layers placed in front <of the eye, serving to defend it from injury by their closure. When534 APPENDAGES OE THE EYE. drawn open, they leave between them an elliptical space (fissura pal- pebrarum), the angles of which are called canthi. The outer canthus is formed by the meeting of the two lids at an acute angle. The inner canthus is prolonged for a short distance inwards towards the nose, and a triangular space is left between the lids in this situation, which is called the lacus lachrymalis. At the commencement of the lacus lachrymalis upon each of the two lids is a small angular projec- tion, the lachrymal papilla or tubercle; and at the apex of each papilla a small orifice (punctum lachrymale), the commencement of the lachrymal canal. The eyelids have, entering into their structure, integument^ orbi- cularis muscle, tarsal cartilages, Meibomian glands, and con- junctiva. The tegumentary cellular tissue of the eyelids is remarkable for its looseness and for the absence of adipose substance ; it is particu- larly liable to serous infil- tration. The fibres of that portion (palpebralis) of the orbicularis muscle which covers the eyelids are thin and pale. The Tarsal cartilages are two thin lamellae of fibro-cartilage, about an inch in length, which give form and support to the eyelids. The superior is of a semilunar form, about one-third of an inch in breadth at its middle, and tapering to each extremity. Its lower border is broad and flat, its upper thin, and gives attachment to the levator palpebrae and to the fibrous membrane of the lids. The Inferior fibro-cartilage is an elliptical band, narrower than the superior, and situated in the substance of the lower lid. Its upper border is flat, and corresponds with the flat edge of the upper cartilage. The lower is held in its place by the fibrous membrane. Near the inner canthus the tarsal cartilages terminate, at the com- * Appendages of the eye. 1. Superior tarsal cartilage. 2.

At their outer extremity they terminate at a short distance from the angle of the canthns, and are retained in position by means of a decussation of the fibrous structure of the broad tarsal ligament, called the external pal- pebral or external tarsal ligament. The Fibrous membrane of the lids is firmly attached to the peri- osteum, around the margin of the orbit, by its circumference, and to the tarsal cartilages by its central margin. It is thick and dense on the outer half of the orbit, but becomes thin to its inner side. Its use is to retain the tarsal cartilages in their place and give sup- port to the lids; hence it has been named the broad tarsal ligament. The Meibomian glands* are embedded in the substance of the car- tilages, and are very distinctly seen on examining the inner aspect of the lids. They have the appearance of parallel strings of pearls, Fig. 183.t about thirty in number in the upper cartilage, and somewhat fewer in the lower ; and open by minute foramina on the edges of the lids. They correspond in length with the breadth of the cartilage, and are consequently longer in the upper than in the lower lid. Each gland consists of a single lengthened follicle or tube, into which a number of small clustered follicles open : the latter are so numerous as almost to conceal the tube by which the secretion is poured out upon the margin of the lids. Occasionally an arch is formed between two of them, and produces a graceful appearance. * Henry Meibomius " De Vasis Palpebrarum Novis," 1666. t Meibomian glands, as seen upon the inner side of the eyelids.

These are the eye-lashes {cilia) important organs of defence to the sensitive surface of so delicate a structure as the eye. Their follicles are supplied with sebiparous glands like those of other hairs. The Conjunctiva is the mucous membrane of the eye. It covers the whole of its anterior surface, and is then reflected upon the lids so as to form their internal layer. The duplicatures formed between the globe of the eye and the lids are called the superior and inferior palpebral sinuses, the former being deeper than the latter. Where it covers the cornea, the conjunctiva is very thin and closely adherent, and no vessels can be traced into it. Upon the sclerotica it is thicker and less adherent, but upon the inner surface of the lids is very closely connected, and exceedingly vascular. It is continuous with the general gastro-pulmonary mucous membrane, and sym- pathizes in its affections, as may be observed in various diseases. From the surface of the eye it may be traced through the lachrymal ducts into the lachrymal gland ; along the edges of the lids it is con- tinuous with the mucous lining of the Meibomian glands, and at the inner angle of the eye may be followed through the lachrymal canals into the lachrymal sac, and thence downwards through the nasal duct into the inferior meatus of the nose. The Caruncula lachrymalis is the small reddish body which oc- cupies the lacus lachrymalis at the inner canthus of the eye. In health it presents a bright pink tint; in sickness it loses its colour, and becomes pale. It consists of an assemblage of follicles similar to the Meibomian glands, embedded in a fibre-cartilaginous tissue, and is the source of the whitish secretion which so constantly forms at the inner angle of the eye. It is covered with minute hairs, which are sometimes so long as to be visible to the naked eye. Immediately to the outer side of the caruncula is a slight dupli- cature of the conjunctiva, called plica semilunaris, which contains a minute plate of cartilage, and is the rudiment of the third lid of animals, the membrana nictitans of birds. Vessels and Nerves.—The palpebrse are supplied internally with arteries from the ophthalmic, and externally from the facial and transverse facial. Their nerves are branches of the fifth and of the facial. LACHRYMAL APPARATUS. The Lachrymal apparatus consists of the lachrymal gland with its excretory ducts ; the puncta lachrymalia and lachrymal canals ; the lachrymal sac and nasal duct. The Lachrymal gland is situated at the upper and outer angle of the orbit, and consists of two portions, orbital and palpebral. The537 LACHRYMAL GLAND.—NASAL DUCT. . orbital portion, about three quarters of an inch in length, is flattened and oval in shape, and occupies the lachrymal fossa of the orbital plate of the frontal bone. It is in contact superiorly with the peri- osteum, with which it is closely connected by its upper and convex surface; by its inferior or concave surface it is in relation with the globe of the eye, and the superior and external rectus; and by its anterior border with the broad tarsal ligament. By its posterior border it receives its vessels. The palpebral portion, smaller than the preceding, is situated in the upper eyelid, extending downwards to the superior margin of the tarsal cartilage. It is connected with the orbital portion above, and is enclosed in an investment of dense fibrous membrane. The secretion of the lachrymal gland is conveyed away by from eight to twelve small ducts which run for a short dis- tance beneath the conjunctiva, and open upon its surface by a series of pores, about one-twentieth of an inch apart, situated in a curved line a little above the upper border of the tarsal cartilage. Lachrymal canals.—The lachrymal canals commence at the minute openings, puncta lachrymalia, seen upon the lachrymal papillae of the lids at the outer extremity of the lacus lachrymalis, and proceed inwards to the lachrymal sac, where they terminate beneath a valvular semilunar fold of the lining membrane. The superior duct at first ascejQds, and then turns suddenly inwards towards the sac, forming an albrupt angle. The inferior duct forms the same kind of angle, by descending at first, and then turning abruptly inwards. They are dense and elastic in structure, and remain constantly open, so that they act like capillary tubes in absorbing the tears from the surface of the eye. The two fasciculi of the tensor tarsi muscle are inserted into these ducts, and serve to draw them inwards. The Lachrymal sac is the upper extremity of the nasal duct, and is scarcely more dilated than the rest of the canal. It is lodged in the groove of the lachrymal bone, and is often distinguished internally, from the nasal duct, by a semilunar or circular valve. The sac consists of mucous membrane, but is covered in and retained in its place by a fibrous expansion, derived from the tendon of the obicularis, which is inserted into the ridge of the lachrymal bone; it is also covered by the tensor tarsi muscle, which arises from the same ridge, and in its action upon the lachrymal canals may serve to compress the lachrymal sac. The Nasal duct is a short canal about three quarters of an inch in length, directed downwards, backwards, and a little outwards to the inferior meatus of the nose, where it terminates by an expanded orifice. It is lined by mucous membrane, which is continuous with the conjunctiva above, and with the pituary membrane of the nose below. Obstruction, from inflammation and suppuration of this duct, constitutes the disease called fistula lachrymalis. Vessels and Nerves. —The lachrymal gland is supplied with blood by the lachrymal branch of the ophthalmic artery, and with nerves by the lachrymal branch of the ophthalmic nerve.538 THE ORGAN OF HEARINa. The apparatus of hearing is composed of three parts, the external ear, middle ear or tympanum, and internal ear or labyrinth. The External ear consists of two portions, the pinna and meatus; the former representing a kind of funnel which collects the vibrations of the atmosphere, producing sounds, and the latter a tube which conveys the vibrations to the tympanum. The Pinna presents a number of folds and hollows upon its surface, which have different names assigned to them. Thus, the external folded margin is called the helix (fXi?, a fold). The ele- vation parallel with and in front of the helix is the antihelix (dvri, opposite). The pointed process, projecting like a valve over the opening of the ear from the face is the tragus (rpdyog, a goat), probably from being sometimes covered with bristly hair like that of a goat; and, a tubercle opposite to this, is the antitragus. The lower dependent and fleshy portion of the pinna is the lohulus. The space between the helix and antihelix is named the fossa innominata (scaphoidea). Another depression is observed at the upper ex- tremity of the antihelix, which bifurcates and leaves a triangular space between its branches, called the fossa triangularis (ovalis); and the large central space, to which all the channels converge, is the concha, which opens directly into the meatus. The pinna is composed of integument, fihro-cartilage, ligaments, and muscles. The Integument is thin, contains an abundance of sebiparous glands and is closely connected with the fibro-cartilage. The Fihro-cartilage gives form to the pinna, and is folded so as to produce the various convexities and grooves which have been described upon its surface. The helix begins in the concha, and partially divides that cavity into two parts; on its anterior border, where it commences its curve upwards, is a tubercle or spine, and a little above this a small vertical fissure, fissure of the helix. The termination of the helix and antihelix forms a lengthened process, the processus caudatus, which is separated from the concha by an extensive fissure. Upon the anterior surface of the tragus is another fissure, \h.Q fissure of the tragus; and, in the lobulus, the fibro-car- tilage is wholly deficient. The fibro-cartilage of the meatus is divided from the concha by several fissures (fissures of Santorinus), and at the upper and anterior part of the cylinder is a consider- able space, which is closed by muscular and ligamentous fibres; it is firmly attached at its termination to the processus auditorius. The Ligaments of the external ear are those which attach the pinna to the side of the head, viz., anterior, posterior, and ligament539 MUSCLES OF THE PINNA. of the tragus; and those of the fibro-cartilage, which serve to pre- serve its folds and connect the opposite margins of the fissures. The latter are two in number, the ligament between the concha and pro- cessus caudatus, and the broad ligament which extends from the upper margin of the fibro-cartilage of the tragus to the helix, and completes the meatus. The proper Muscles of the pinna are the— Major helicis, Antitragicus, Minor helicis, Transversus auriculae, Tragicus, Obliquus auris, Dilatator conchse. Mg. 184.* * The pinna and its muscles.

It arises from the spine of the helix and is inserted into the anterior border of that fold. The Minor helicis is placed upon the anterior extremity (crus) of the helix, at its commencement in the fossa of the concha. The Tragicus is a thin quadrilateral layer of muscular fibres, situated upon the tragus. The Antitragicus arises from the 'antitragus, and is inserted into the posterior surface of the processus caudatus of the helix. The Transversus awiculcB, partly tendinous and partly muscular, extends transversely from the convexity of the concha to that of the helix, on the posterior surface of the pinna.

TYMPANUM, 541 the upper part of the convexity of the concha and the convexity immediately above it. The Dilatator conchce is a thin band of muscular fibres which crosses the fissure between the cartilage of the meatus and tragus on its anterior aspect. Mr. Tod* describes, besides, a contractor meatus, or trago-helicus muscle. The Meatus auditorius is a canal, partly cartilaginous and partly osseous, about an inch in length, which extends inwards and a little forwards from the concha to the tympanum. It is narrower in the middle than at each extremity, forms an oval cylinder, the long diameter being vertical, and is slightly curved upon itself, the con- cavity looking downwards. It is lined by an extremely thin pouch of epithelium, which, when withdrawn after maceration, preserves the form of the meatus. Some stilf short hairs are also found in its interior, which stretch across the tube, and prevent the ingress of insects and dust. In the substance of its lining membrane are a number of ceruminous glands, which secrete the wax of the ear. Vessels and Nerves.—The pinna is plentifully supplied with arteries; by the anterior auricular from the temporal, by the pos- terior auricular from the external carotid, and by a branch from the occipital artery. Its Nerves are derived from the auriculo-temporal of the fifth, the posterior auricular of the facial, and the auricularis magnus of the cervical plexus. Middle ear or tympanum.—The tympanum is an irregular bony cavity, compressed from without inwards, and situated within the petrous bone. It is bounded externally, by the meatus and mem- brana tympani; internally, by the base of the petrous bone; behind, by the mastoid cells ; and, throughout the rest of its circumference, by the thin osseous layer which connects the petrous with the squamous portion of the temporal bone. The Memhrana tympani is a thin and semi-transparent membrane of an oval shape, its long diameter being vertical. It is inserted into a groove situated around the circumference of the meatus, near its termination, and is placed obliquely across the area of that tube, the direction of the obliquity being downwards and inwards. It is concave towards the meatus, convex towards the tympanum, and composed of three layers, external, or epithelial ; middle, fibrous and muscular; and, internal, mucous, derived from the mucous lining of the tympanum. The tympanum contains three small bones, ossicula audittls, viz., the malleus, incus, and stapes. * " The Anatomy and Physiology of the Organ of Hearing," by David Tod 1832.OSSICULA AUDITUS. 542 The Malleus (hammer) consists of a head, neck, handle (manu- brium)^ and two processes, long (processus gracilis), and short (pro- cessus brevis). The manuhrium is connected with the membrana tympani by its whole length, extending below the central point of that membrane. It lies beneath the mucous layer of the membrane, and serves as a point of attachment to which the radiating fibres of the fibrous layer converge. The long process descends to a groove near the fissura Grlaseri, and gives attachment to the laxator tympani muscle.

It has also been likened to a bicuspid tooth, having one root longer than, and widely separated from, the other. It consists of two processes, which unite nearly at right angles, and at their junction form a flattened body, which articulates with the head of the malleus. The short process is attached to the margin of the opening of the mastoid cells by means of a ligament; the long process descends nearly parallel with the handle of the malleus, and curves inwards, near its termination. At its extremity is a small globular projection, the OS orbiculare, which in the foetus is a distinct bone, but becomes anchylosed to the long process of the incus in the adult; this process articulates with the head of the stapes. The Stapes is shaped like a stirrup, to which it bears a close re- semblance. Its head articulates with the os orbiculare, and the two branches (crura) are connected by their extremities with a flat, oval- shaped plate, representing the foot of the stirrup. The foot of the stirrup is received into the fenestra ovalis, to the margin of which it is connected by means of a ligament: it is in contact, by its surface, with the membrana vestibuli, and is covered in by the mucous lining of the tympanum. The neck of the stapes gives attachment to the stapedius muscle. The ossicula auditus are retained in position and moved upon themselves by means of ligaments and muscles. The Ligaments are three in number; the suspensory ligament of the malleus, which is attached by one extremity to the upper wall of the tympanum, and by the other to the head of the malleus; the posterior ligament of the incus, a short and thick band, which serves to attach the extremity of the short process of that bone to the margin of the opening of the mastoid cells : and the annular ligament which connects the margin of the foot of the stapes with the circumference of the fenestra ovalis. These ligaments have been described as muscles, by Mr. Tod, under the names of superior capitis mallei, obliquus incudis externus posterior, and musculus vel structura stapedii inferior. Arnold adds as a fourth a suspensory ligament of the incus. The Muscles of the tympanum are four in number, the— Tensor tympani, Laxator tympani, Laxator tympani minor, Stapedius. Tli.o Tensor tympani (musculus internus mallei) arises from the spinous process of the sphenoid, from the petrous portion of the tem- poral bone, and from the Eustachian tube, and passes forwards in a distinct canal, separated from the tube by the processus cochleari- formis, to be inserted into the handle of the malleus, immediately below the root of the processus gracilis. The Laxator tympani (musculus externus mallei) arises from the544 OPENIJJGS OF THE TYMPANUM. spinous process of the sphenoid bone, and passes through an opening in the fissura Grlaseri, to be inserted into the neck of the malleus, just above the root of the processus gracilis. This is regarded as a ligament (anterior ligament of the malleus) by some anatomists. The Laxator tympani minor (posterior ligament of the malleus) arises from the upper margin of the meatus, and is inserted into the handle and processus brevis of the malleus. This is regarded as a ligament by some anatomists. The Stapedius arises from the interior of the pyramid, and escapes from its summit to be inserted into the neck of the stapes. Foramina.—The openings in the tympanum are ten in number, five large andj^z^e small; they are—- The opening of the meatus auditorius has been already described. The Fenestra ovalis (fenestra vestibuli) is a reniform opening, situated at the bottom of a small oval fossa (pelvis ovalis), in the upper part of the inner wall of the tympanum, directly opposite the meatus. The long diameter of the fenestra is directed horizontally, audits convex borders upwards. It is the opening of communica- tion between the tympanum and vestibule, and is closed by the foot of the stapes and by the lining membrane of both cavities. The Fenestra rotunda (fenestra cochlese) is somewhat triangular in form, and situated in the inner wall of the tympanum, below and rather posteriorly to the fenestra ovalis, from which it is sepa- rated by a bony elevation, called the promontory. It serves to esta- blish a communication between the tympanum and cochlea. In the fresh subject it is closed by a proper membrane (m. tympani secun- daria) as well as by the lining of both cavities. The Mastoid cells are numerous, and occupy the whole of the in- terior of the mastoid process and part of the petrous bone. They communicate by a large irregular opening with the upper and poste- rior circumference of the tympanum. The Eustachian tube is a short canal about an inch and three quarters in length, extending obliquely between the pharynx and the anterior circumference of the tympanum. In structure it is partly fibro-cartilaginous and partly osseous, is broad and expanded at its pharyngeal extremity, and narrow and compressed at the tympanum. The Smaller openings serve for the transmission of the chorda tympani nerve, and three of the muscles of the tympanum. The opening by which the chorda tympani enters the tympanum Large Openings.

The opening of exit for the chorda tympani is at the fissnra Glaseri in the anterior wall of the tympanum. The opening for the laxator tympani muscle is also situated in the fissura Grlaseri, in the anterior wall of the tympanum. The opening for the tensor tympani muscle is in the inner wall, immediately above the opening of the Eustachian tube. The opening for the stapedius muscle is at the apex of a conical bony eminence, called the pyramid, which is situated on the posterior wall of the tympanum, immediately behind the fenestra ovalis. Directly above the fenestra ovalis is a rounded ridge formed by the projection of the aquoiductus Fallopii. Beneath the fenestra ovalis and separating it from the fenestra rotunda is the promontory, a rounded prominence formed by the projection of the first turn of the cochlea. It is channelled upon its surface by three small grooves, which lodge the three tympanic branches of Jacobson's nerve. The Foramina and processes of the tympanum may be arranged, according to their situation, into four groups. 1. In the External wall is the meatus auditorius, closed by the membfana tympani. 2. In the Inner wall, from above downwards, are the— Opening for the tensor tympani, Eidge of the aquseductus Fallopii, Fenestra ovalis, Promontory, with the grooves for Jacobson's nerve, Fenestra rotunda. The tympanum is lined by a vascular mucous membrane, which invests the ossicula and chorda tympani, and forms the internal layer of the membrana tympani. From the tympanum it is re- flected into the mastoid cells, which it lines throughout, and it passes through the Eustachian tube to become continuous with the mucous membrane of the pharynx.

A filament from the otic ganglion to the tensor tympani muscle. Internal ear.—The Internal ear is called labyrinth, from the complexity of its communications ; it consists of a membranous and an osseous portion. The osseous labyrinth presents a series of cavi- ties, which are channelled through the substance of the petrous bone, and is situated between the cavity of the tympanum and the meatus auditorius internus. It is divisible into the— Vestibule, Semicircular canals. Cochlea. The Vestibule is a small three-cornered cavity, compressed from without inwards, and situated immediately within the inner wall of the tympanum. The three corners, which are named ventricles or cornna, are placed, one anteriorly, one superiorly, and one posteriorly. The Anterior ventricle receives the oval aperture of the scala vesti- buli; the superior, the ampuUary openings of the superior and hori- zontal semicircular canal; the posterior, the ampullary opening of the oblique semicircular canal, the common aperture of the oblique and perpendicular canal, the termination of the horizontal canal, and the aperture of the aquseductus vestibuli. In the anterior ven- tricle is a small depression, which corresponds with the posterior segment of the cul de sac of the meatus auditorius internus; it is called the fovea hemispherica, and is pierced by a cluster of small openings, the macula cribrosa. In the superior ventricle of the vestibule is another small depression, the fovea elliptica, which is separated from the fovea hemispherica by a projecting crest, the eminentia pyramidalis. The latter is pierced by numerous minute openings for the passage of nervons filaments. T«he posterior ven- tricle presents a third small depression, the fovea sidciformis, which leads upwards to the ostium aquseductus vestibuli. The internal wall of the vestibule corresponds with the bottom of the cul de sac of the meatus auditorius internus, and is pierced by numerous small openings for the transmission of nervous filaments. In the external or tympanic wall is the reniform opening of the fenestra ovalis (fenestra vestibuli), the margin of which presents a prominent rim towards the cavity of the vestibule.N N 2 SEMICIKCULAR CANALS—COCHLEA. 5i7 The openings of the vestibule may be arranged, like those of the tympanum, into large and small. The Large openings aire seven in number : viz. the— Fenestra ovalis, Scala vestibuli, Five openings of the three semicircular canals. The Small openings are the—• Aquseductus vestibuli, Openings for small arteries. Openings for filaments of the auditory nerve. The fenestra ovalis has already been described; it is the opening from the tympanum. The opening of the scala vestibuli is the oval termination of the vestibular canal of the cochlea. The aquceductus vestibuli (canal of Cotunnius) is the commence- ment of the small canal which opens under the osseous scale on the posterior surface of the petrous bone. It gives passage to a process of membrane (which is continuous internally with the lining mem- bran^ of the vestibule, and externally with the dura mater), and to a small vein. The openings for arteries and nerves are situated in the internal wall of the vestibule, and correspond with the termination of the meatus auditorius internus. The Semicircular canals are three bony passages communicating with the vestibule, into which they open by both extremities. Near one extremity of each of the canals is a dilatation of its cavity, which is called the ampulla (sinus ampullaceus). The superior, or perpen- dicular canal (canalis semicircularis verticalis superior), is directed transversely across the petrous bone, forming a projection on the anterior face of the latter. It commences, by means of an ampulla, in the superior ventricle of the vestibule, and terminates posteriorly by joining with the oblique, and forming a common canal, which opens into the upper part of the posterior ventricle. The middle or oblique canal (canalis semicircularis verticalis posterior) corresponds with the posterior part of the petrous portion of the temporal bone : it commences by an ampullary dilatation in the posterior ventricle, and curves nearly perpendicularly upwards to terminate in the common canal. In the ampulla of this canal are numerous minute openings for nervous filaments. The inferior or horizontal canal (canalis semicircularis horizontalis) is directed outwards, towards the base of the petrous bone, and is shorter than the two preceding. It commences by an ampullary dilatation in the superior ventricle, and terminates in the posterior ventricle. The Cochlea (snail shell) forms the anterior portion of the laby- rinth, corresponding by its apex with the anterior wall of the petrous bone, and by its base with the anterior depression at the bottom ofINTERNAL EAR—COCHLEA. 548 the cul de sac of the meatas auditorius internus. It consists of an osseous and gradually tapering canal, about one inch and a half in length, which makes two turns and a half spirally around a central axis, called the modiolus. The central axis, or modiolus, is large near its base, where it cor- responds with the first turn of the cochlea, and diminishes in diameter towards its extremity. At its base, it is pierced by numerous minute openings, which transmit the filaments of the cochlear nerve. These openings are disposed in a spiral manner; hence they have received, from Cotunnius* the name of tractus spiralis foraminulentus. The modiolus is everywhere traversed, in the direction of its length, by minute canals, which proceed from the tractus spiralis foraminu- lentus, and terminate upon the sides of the modiolus, by opening into the canal of the cochlea or upon the surface of its lamina spiralis. The central canal of the tractus spiralis foraminulentus is larger than the rest, and is named the tubulus centralis modioli; it is continued onwards to the ex- tremity of the modio- lus, and transmits a nerve and small artery (arteria centralis mo- dioli). The interior of the canal of the cochlea is partially divided into two passages (sca- Isb) by means of a thin and porous lamina of bone (zonula ossea la- minae spiralis), which is wound spirally around the modiolus in the direction of the canal. The bony septum extends for about two-thirds across the diameter of the canal, and in * Dominico Cotunnius, an ItaKan physician; his dissertation " De Aquse- ductibus Auris Humanse Internse" was pubhshed at Naples in 1761, t The cochlea divided parallel with its axis, through the centre of the modiolus.

Inferiorly, one of the two scalse, the scala vestibuli, terminates by means of an oval aperture in the anterior ventricle of the vestibule; while the other, the scala tym- pani, becomes somewhat expanded, and opens into the tympanum through the fenestra rotunda (fenestra cochleae). Near the termi- nation of the scala tympani is the small opening of the aquaeductus cochleae. The internal surface of the osseous labyrinth is lined by a Jibro- serous membrane, which is analogous to the dura mater in perform- ing the office of a periosteum by its exterior, whilst it fulfils the purpose of a serous membrane by its internal layer, secreting a limpid fluid, the aqua labyrinthi (perilymph, liquor Cotunnii), and sending a reflection inwards upon the nerves distributed to the mem- branous labyrinth. In the cochlea, the membrane of the labyrinth invests the two surfaces of the bony lamina spiralis, and being con- tinued from its border across the diameter of the canal to its outer wall, forms the membranous lamina spiralis, and completes the sepa- ration between the scala tympani and scala vestibuli. The fenestra ovalis and fenestra rotunda are closed by an extension of this mem- brane across them, assisted by the membrane of the tympanum and a proper intermediate layer. Besides lining the interior of the osseous cavity, the membrane of the labyrinth sends two delicate processes along the aqueducts of the vestibule and cochlea to the internal surface of the dura mater, with which they are continuous. These processes are the remains of a communication originally subsisting between the dura mater and the cavity of the labyrinth.* The Membranous labyrinth is smaller in size, but a perfect counterpart with respect to form, of the vestibule and semicircular canals. It consists of a small elongated sac, sacculus communis (utriculus communis); of three semicircular membranous canals, which correspond with the osseous canals, and communicate with the sacculus communis; and of a small round sac (sacculus pro- j)rius), which occupies the anterior ventricle of the vestibule, and lies in close contact with the external surface of the sacculus com- munis. The membranous semicircular canals are two-thirds smaller in diameter than the osseous canals. The membranous labyrinth is retained in its position by means of the numerous nervous filaments which are distributed to it from the * Cotunnius regarded these processes as tubular canals, through which the superabundant aqua labyrinthi might be expelled into the cavity of the cranium. Wharton Jones, in the article " Organ of Hearing," in the Cyclopsedia of Anatomy and Physiology, also describes them as tubular canals which terminate beneath the dura mater of the petrous bone in a small dilated pouch. In the ear of a man deaf and dumb from birth, he found the ter- mination of the aqueduct of the vestibule of unusually large size in conse- quence of'^regular development.551 AUDITORY NERVE. openings in the inner wall of the vestibule, and is separated from the lining membrane of the labyrinth by the aqua labyrinthi. In struc- ture it is composed of four layers; an external or serous layer, derived from the lining membrane of the labyrinth; a vascular layer, in which an abundance of minute vessels are distributed; a nervous layer, formed by the expansion of the filaments of the vestibular nerve; and an internal and serous membrane, by which the limpid fluid which fills its interior is secreted. Some patches of pigment have been observed by Wharton Jones in the tissue of the membra- nous labyrinth of man. Among animals such spots are constant. The membranous labyrinth is filled with a limpid fluid, first well described by Scarpa, and thence named liquor Scarpse* (endolymph, vitreous humour of the ear), and contains two small calcareous masses, called otoconites. The otoconites {ovg, cjrbg, koviq, ear- dust) consist of an assemblage of minute, crystalline particles of car- bonate and phosphate of lime, held together by animal substance, and probably retained in form by a reflection of the lining membrane of the membranous labyrinth. They are found suspended in the liquor Scarpae; one in the sacculus communis, the other in the sacculus proprius, from that part of each sac with which the nerves are connected. ') The Auditory nerve divides into two branches at the bottom of the cul de sac of the meatus auditorius internus; a vestibular nerve and a cochlear nerve. The vestibular nerve, the posterior of the two, divides into three branches, superior, middle, and inferior. The superior vestibular branch gives ofi" a number of filaments which pass through the minute openings of the eminentia pyramidalis and superior ventricle of the vestibule, and are distributed to the sac- culus communis and ampuUse of the perpendicular and horizontal semicircular canals. The middle vestibular branch sends off nu- merous filaments, which pass through the openings of the macula cribrosa in the anterior ventricle of the vestibule, and are distri- buted to the sacculus proprius. The inferior and smallest branch takes its course backwards to the posterior wall of the vestibule, and gives off filaments which pierce the wall of the ampullary dila- tation of the oblique canal to be distributed upon its ampulla. According to Stiefensand, there is in the situation of the point of entrance of the nervous filaments into the ampulla a deep depression upon the exterior of the membrane, and upon the interior a corre- sponding projection, which forms a kind of transverse septum, par- tially dividing the cavity of the ampulla into two chambers. In the substance of the sacculi and ampuUse, the nervous filaments radiate * Antonio Scarpa is celebrated for several beautiful surgical and anatomical monographs; as, for example, his work on "Aneurism," "De Auditu et Olfactu," &c.

The Cochlear nerve divides into numerous filaments which enter the foramina of the tractus spiralis foraminulentus in the base of the cochlea, and passing upwards in the canals of the modiolus, bend outwards at right angles, to be distributed in the tissue of the lamina spiralis. The central portion of the nerve passes through the tubulus centralis of the modiolus, and supplies the apicial portion of the lamina spiralis. In the lamina spiralis the nervous filaments lying side by side on an even plane form numerous anastomosing loops, and spread out into a nervous membrane. According to Treviranus and Grottsche, the ultimate terminations of the filaments assume the form of papillae. The A rteries of the labyrinth are derived from the internal audi- tory branch of the superior cerebellar or basilar artery, and from the stylo-mastoid. OEGAN OF TASIE. The Tongue is composed of muscular fibres, which are distributed in layers arranged in various directions: thus, some are disposed longitudinally (lingualis superEcialis); others transversely (lin- gualis transversus); others, again, ooliquely and vertically. Be- tween the miiScular fibres is a considerable quantity of adipose sub- stance, and in the middle of the organ a vertical septum of fibrous tissue. The tongue is connected, posteriorly, with the os hyoides by mus- cular attachment; and to the epiglottis by mucous membrane, which forms the three glosso-epiglottic folds called froina epiglottidis. On either side it is held in connexion with the lower jaw by mucous membrane; and in front, a fold of that membrane, which is named froenum linguce, is formed beneath its under surface. The surface of the tongue is covered by a dense layer analogous to the corium of the skin, which gives support to papillge. A raphe marks the middle line of the organ, and divides it into symmetrical halves. The Papillce of the tongue are the— Papillae circumvallat^, Papillae filiformes. Papillae conicae, Papillae fungiformes. The Papillce circumvallatce (p. lenticulares) are of large size, and from fifteen to twenty in number. They are situated on the dorsum of the tongue, near its root, and form a row on each side, which meets its fellow at the middle line, like the two branches of the letter A. E^ch papilla resembles a cone, attached by its apex to the bottom of a cup-shaped depression: hence they are also named553 PAPILLiE OF THE TONGUE. papillae calyciformes. This cup-sliaped cavity forms a kind of fossa around the papilla, whence their name circumvallatce. At the meeting of the two rows of these papilla upon the middle of the root of the tongue, is a deep mucous follicle called foramen ccecum. The Papillce conicce and filiformes cover the whole surface of the tongue in front of the circumvallatse, but are most abundant towards its anterior part. They are conical and filiform in shape, and many of them are pierced at the extremity by a minute aperture. Hence, they may be regarded as follicles rather than sentient organs; the true sentient papillae being ex- tremely minute and occupying Fig. 189.* their surface, as they do that of the other papillae of the tongue. The Papillce fungiformes (p. capitatse) are irregularly dispersed over the dorsum of the tongue, and are easily recognised among the other papillae by their rounded heads, larger size, and red colour. A number of these papillae will generally be observed at the tip of the tongue. Behind the papilla circumval- latae, at the root of the tongue, are ■ a number of mucous glands (lingual), which open upon the surface. There is also a small cluster beneath the tip of the tongue. Vessels and Nerves. — The tongue is abundantly supplied with blood by the lingual arteries. The Nerves are three in number, and of large size : the gustatory branch of the inferior maxillary, which is distributed to the pa- pillae, and is the nerve of common sensation and taste; the glosso- pharyngeal, which is distributed to the mucous membrane, glands, and papillae circumvallatae ; and the hypoglossal, which is the motor nerve of the tongue, and is distributed to the muscles. * The tongue with its papillae. 1.

The Mucous membrane which invests the tongue is continnons with the derma along the margin of the lips. On either side of the frgenum linguge it may be traced through the sublingual ducts into the sublingual glands, and along Wharton's* ducts into the sub- maxillary glands ; from the sides of the cheeks it passes through the opening of Stenon's+ ducts to the parotid glands: in the fauces, it forms the assemblage of follicles called tonsils, and may thence be traced downwards into the larynx and pharynx, where it is conti- nuous with the general gastro-pulmonary mucous membrane. Beneath the mucous membrane of the mouth are a number of small glandular granules, which pour their secretion upon the surface. A considerable number of these bodies are situated within the lips, in the palate, and in the floor of the mouth. They are named according to their position labial glands, palatal glands, and buccal glands. OEGAN OF TOUCH. The SJcin is the exterior investment of the body, which it serves to cover and protect. It is continuous at the apertures of the internal cavities with the lining membrane of those cavities, the internal skin or mucous membrane, and is composed essentially of two layers, derma and epiderma. The DERMA or cutis is chiefly composed of cellulo-fibrous tissue, besides which it has entering into its structure elastic and con- tractile fibrous tissue, together with blood-vessels, lymphatic vessels and nerves. The cellulo-fibrous tissue exists in greatest abundance in the deeper stratum of the derma, which is consequently dense, white, and coarse; the superficial stratum, on the other hand, is fine in texture, reddish in colour, soft, raised into minute papillse, and highly vascular and sensitive. These differences in structure have given rise to a division of the derma into the deep stratum, or corium, and the superficial, or papillary layer. In the Corium the cellulo-fibrous tissue is collected into fasciculi, which are small and closely interwoven in the superficial strata, large and coarse in the deep strata ; in the latter forming an areolar net-work, with large areola, which are occupied by adipose tissue. These areolge are the channels through which the branches of vessels and nerves find a safe passage to the papillary layer, in which and in the superficial strata of the corium they are principally distri- buted. The yellow elastic tissue is found chiefly in the superficial strata, the red contractile tissue in the deep. It is to the latter that * Thomas Wharton, an English physician, devoted considerable attention to the anatomy of the various glands; his work, entitled " Adenographia," &c., was published in 1656. t l^icholas Stenon, a Danish anatomist: he was made Professor in Copen- hagen in 1672.DEKMA OR CUTIS. 555 Fig. 190. the nipples and scrotum owe their contractile power, and the ge- neral surface of the skin the contraction which is known by the name of cutis anserina. The corium presents some variety in thick- ness in different parts of the body. Thus in the more exposed regions, as the back, the outer sides of the limbs, the palms, and the soles, it is remarkable for its thickness ; while on protected parts it is comparatively thin. On the eyelids, the penis, and the scrotum it is peculiarly delicate. It is connected by its under surface with the common superficial fascia of the body. The Papillary layer of the derma is raised in the form of conical prominences or papillse. On the ge- neral surface of the body the papillae are short and exceedingly minute ; but in other situations, as the palmar surface of the hands and fingers, and the plantar surface of the feet and toes, they are long and of large size. They also differ in arrangement; for, on the general surface they are dis- tributed at unequal distances and without order; whereas, on the palms and soles, and on the corresponding surfaces of the fingers and toes, they are collected into little square clumps, containing from ten to twenty pa- pillse; and these little clumps are disposed in parallel rows. It is this arrangement in rows that gives rise to the characteristic parallel ridges and furrows which are met with on the hands and feet. The papilla in these little square clumps are for the most part uni- form in size and length, but every here and there one papilla may be observed which is longer than the rest. The largest papillse of the derma are those which produce the nail; in the dermal follicle of * Anatomy of a portion of skin from the palm of the hand. 1. The papil- lary layer, in which the longitudinal furrows (2) marking the arrangement of the papihse into ridges is shown. Each ridge is, moreover, divided by trans- verse furrows (3) into small quadrangular clumps. The quadrangular clumps consist of a tuft of minute conical papiUse, of which one or two are frequently longer and larger than the rest. In this figure the long papillae are alone seen, the rest being too numerous to introduce into a wood-engraving. 4. The rete mucosum raised from the papillary layer, and turned back; the under surface of this stratum presents an accurate impression of the papillary layer; on it are seen longitudinal ridges corresponding with the longitudinal furrows, transverse ridges corresponding with the transverse furrows and quadrangular depressions corresponding with the quadrangular clumps of papillse. More- over, wherever one of the long papiUse exists, a distinct conical sheath vdll be found in the rete mucosum. 5, 5.

In structure each papilla is composed of a more or less convoluted capillary, and a more or less convoluted nervous loop. The Epiderma or cuticle (epidermis, scarfskin) is a product of the derma, which it serves to envelope and defend. That surface of the epiderma which is exposed to the influence of the atmosphere and exterior sources of injury, is hard and horny in texture, while that which lies in contact with the papillary layer is soft and cel- lular. Hence the epiderma, like the derma, is divisible into two layers, external and internal, the latter being termed the rete mii- cosum. Moreover, the epiderma is laminated in structure, and the laminee present a progressively increasing tenuity and density as (liquor sanguinis) is poured out upon the surface of the derma. This fluid, by virtue of the vital force inherent in itself, and communicated to it by contact with a living tissue, is converted into granules, which are termed cell-germs or cytoblasts. By endosmosis, these cytoblasts imbibe serum from the plastic lymph and adjacent tissues, and the outermost layer or pellicle of the cytoblast becomes gradually dis- tended by the imbibed fluid. The cytoblast has now become a cell, and the solid portion of the cytoblast, which always remains adhe- rent to some one point of the internal surface of the cell-membrane, is the nucleus of the cell. Moreover, within the nucleus one or se- veral nuclei are formed, which are termed nucleoli. By a continu - * Diagram illustrative of the development of the epiderma, and of epithelia in general, according to the theory of Schwann. 1. A granule or cytoblast. 2.

Fig. 191.* they advance from the inner to the outer surface. This difference of density is dependent on the mode of growth of the epiderma, for as the external surface is con- stantly subjected to destruction from attrition and chemical ac- tion, so the membrane is continu- ally reproduced on its internal surface; new layers being succes- sively formed on the derma to take the place of the old. The theory of growth of the epiderma, deduced from the ob- servations of Schwann, is as fol- lows : a stratum of plastic lymphDEVELOPMENT OF EPIDEEMA. 557 ance of the process of imbibition, the cell becomes more or less sphe- rical ; so that, after a time, every part of the surface of the papillary- layer of the derma is coated by a thin and membranous stratum, con- sisting of spherical cells lying closely pressed together, and cor- responding with every irregularity which the papillae present. But, as this production of cells is a function constantly in operation, a new layer is formed before the first is completed, and the latter is separated by subsequent formations farther and farther from the surface of the papillary layer. As a consequence of loss of contact with the derma, the vital force is progressively diminished; the cell becomes subject to the influence of physical laws, and evaporation of its fluid slowly ensues. In consequence of this evaporation, the cell becomes collapsed and flattened, and assumes an elliptical form; the latter is by degrees converted into the flat cell with parallel and contiguous layers, and an included nucleolated nucleus ; and lastly, the flattened cell dessicates into a thin membranous scale, in which the nucleus is scarcely apparent. My own investigations* have shown that, after the original granules of the liquor sanguinis have become aggregated into a gran- ular nucleus, other granules are formed in successive circles, around the circumference of the nucleus, until the entire breadth of the epidermal scale is attained; that the cell never acquires a greater thickness than that of the original nucleus, and, that the formation of the scale results from the desiccation of the cell, as it is gradually pushed outwards from the derma towards the surface. Consequently, the cell never possesses any other than the flattened form; all its phases of growth are perfected in the deepest layer of the epiderma; and, in its internal structure, it is a parent cell containing secondary and tertiary cells and granules, its growth being the result of the growth of tlaese secondary formations. The under surface of the epiderma is accurately modelled on the papillary layer of the derma, each papilla having its appropriate sheath in the newly-formed epiderma or rete mucosum, and each irregularity of surface of the former having its representative in the soft tissue of the latter. On the external surface, this character is lost ; the minute elevations corresponding with the papillse are, as it were, polished down, and the surface is rendered smooth and uni- form. The palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet are, however, an exception to this rule; for here, in consequence of the large size of the papillae and their peculiar arrangement in rows, ridges corresponding with the papillse are strongly marked on the superficial surface of the epiderma. The epiderma is remarkable for its thickness in situations where the papillae are large, as in the palms and soles. In other situations, it assumes a character which is also due to the nature of the surface of the derma ; namely, that of being marked by a network of linear furrows, which trace out the * Diseases of the Skin.558 APPENDAGES OP THE SKIN, surface into small polygonal and lozenge-shaped arese. These lines correspond with the folds of the derma produced by its movements, and are most numerous where those movements are greatest, as in the flexures and on the convexities of joints. The dark colour of the skin among the natives of the South is due to the coloration of the primitive granules of which the cell is com- posed, especially the nucleus. As the cells desiccate, the colour of the granules is lost; hence the deeper hue of the rete mucosum. The 2)ores of the epiderma are the openings of the perspiratory ducts, hair follicles, and sebiparous glands. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the derma which enter its structure through the areolas of the under surface of the corium, divide into innumerable intermediate vessels, which form a rich ca- pillary plexus in the superficial strata of the skin and in its papil- lary layer. In the papillse of some parts of the derma, as in the longitudinal plications beneath the nail, the capillary vessels form simple loops, but in other papillae they are convoluted to a greater or less degree in proportion to the size and importance of the papillae. The Lymphatic vessels probably form, in the superficial strata of the derma, a plexus, the meshes of which are interwoven with those of the capillary and nervous plexus. No lymphatics have as yet been discovered in the papillae. The Nerves of the derma, after entering the areolae of the deeper part of the corium, divide into minute fasciculi, which form a termi- nal plexus in the upper strata of the corium. From this plexus the primitive fibres pass off to their distribution, as loops, in the pa- pillse. In the less sensitive parts of the skin the loops are simple and more or less acute in their bend, in conformity with the figure of the papilla. In the sensitive parts, however, and especially in the tactile papillae of the pulps of the fingers, the loop is convoluted to a greater or less extent, and acts as a multiplier of sensation. APPENDAGES OP THE SKIN. The appendages of the skin are the nails, hairs, sebiparous glands, and perspiratory glands and ducts. The Nails are horny appendages of the skin, identical in forma- tion with the epiderma, of which they are a part. A nail is convex on its external surface, concave within, and implanted by means of a thin margin or root in a fold of the derma, which is nearly two lines in depth, and acts the part of a follicle to the nail. At the bottom of the groove of the follicle are a number of filiform papillae, which produce the margin of the root, and, by the successive forma- tion of new cells, push the nail onwards in its growth. The con- caCre surface of the nail is in contact with the derma, and the latter is covered by papillae, which perform the double office of retaining the nail in its place, and giving it increased thickness by the addi-559 STRUCTURE OF NAILS, tion of newly-formed cells to its under surface. It is this constant change occurring in the under surface of the nail, co-operating with the continual formation taking place along the margin of the root, which ensures the growth of the nail in the proper direction. The nail derives a peculiarity of appearance from the disposition and form of the papill83 on the ungual surface of the derma (matrix). Thus, beneath the root, and for a short distance onwards towards its middle, the derma is covered by papillae which are more minute, and consequently less vascular than the papillae somewhat farther on. This patch of papillae is bounded by a semilunar line, and that part of the nail covering it being lighter in colour than the rest, has been termed lunula. Beyond the lunula the papillge are raised into longitudinal plaits, which are exceedingly vascular, and give a deeper tint of redness to the nail. These plait-like papillae of the * Anatomy of the skin. 1. Epiderma. 2. Eete mucosum or deep layer of the epiderma. 3.

The grannies and cells are developed on every part of their surface, both in the grooves between the plaits and on their sides, and a horny lamina is formed between each pair of plaits. When the under surface of a hail is examined, these longitudinal laminse, corresponding with the longitudinal papillse of the ungual portion of the derma, are dis- tinctly apparent, and if the nail be forcibly detached, the laminag may be seen in the act of parting from the grooves of the papillae. It is this structure that gives rise to the ribbed appearance of the nail. The papillary surface of the derma which produces the nail is continuous around the circumference of the attached part of that organ with the derma of the surrounding skin, and the horny struc- ture of the nail is consequently continuous with that of the epiderma. Hairs are horny appendages of the skin, produced by the involu- tion and subsequent evolution of the epiderma; the involution con- stituting the follicle in which the hair is inclosed, and the evolution the shaft of the hair. Hairs vary much in size and length in dif- ferent parts of the body; in some they are so short as not to appear beyond the follicle; in others, they grow to a great length, as on the scalp; while along the margins of the eyelids, and in the whiskers and beard, they are remarkable for their thickness. Hairs are generally more or less flattened in form, and when the extremity of a transverse section is examined, it is found to possess an elliptical or reniform outline. This examination also demon- strates that the centre of the hair is porous and loose in texture, while its periphery is dense; thus affording ground for its division into a cortical and a medullary portion. The free extremity of a hair is generally pointed, and sometimes split into two or three filaments. Its attached extremity is implanted deeply in the integument, ex- tending through the derma into the subcutaneous cellular tissue, where it is surrounded by adipose cells. The central extremity of a hair is larger than its shaft, and is called the root or bulb. It is rounded or conical in shape. The process of formation of a hair by its follicle is identical with that of the formation of the epiderma by the papillary layer of the derma. Plastic lymph is in the first instance exuded by the capillary plexus of the follicle, the lymph undergoes conversion, first into granules, then into cells, and the latter are elongated into fibres. The cells which are destined to form the surface of the hair go through a different process. They are converted into flat scales, which enclose the fibrous structure of the interior. These scales, as they are successively produced, overlap those which precede and give rise to the prominent and waving lines which may be seen around the cir- cumference of a hair. It is this overlapping line that is the cause of %.e roughness which we experience in drawing a hair, from its point to its bulb, between the fingers. The bulb is the newly-formed portion of the hair : its expanded form is due to the greater bulk of the freshSEBIPAROUS GLANDS.—SUDORIPAROUS GLANDS. 561 cells compared with the fibres and scales into which they are sub- sequently converted in the shaft. The colour of the hair, like that of the epiderma, is due to the coloration of the primitive granules of the cells. The Sebiparous glands are sacculated glandular organs embedded in the substance of the derma, and presenting every variety of com- plexity, from the simplest pouch-like follicle to the sacculated and lobulated gland. In some situations, the excretory ducts of these glands open independently on the surface of the epiderma; while in others, and the most numerous, they terminate in the follicles of the hairs. The sebiparous glands associated with the hairs are racemiform and lobulated in structure, consisting of sacculi which open by short pedunculated tubuli into a common excretory duct, and the latter, after a short course, terminates in the hair-follicle. In the scalp there are two of these glands to each hair-follicle. On the nose and face the glands are of large size, distinctly lobulated, and constantly associated with small hair-follicles. In the meatus auditorius the sebiparous (ceruminous) glands are also large and lobulated; in the eyelids the cilia are supplied like other hairs with sebiparous glands, but the Meibomian glands may also be regarded as belonging to this class, The excretory ducts of sebiparous glands offer some diversity in different parts of the body: thus, in many situations they are short and straight, while in others, as in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, where the epiderma is thick, they assume a spiral arrangement. The sebiferous ducts are lined by an inversion of the epiderma, which forms a thick and funnel-shaped cone at its com- mencement, but soon becomes uniform and soft. Sebiparous glands are met with in all parts of the body, but are most abundant in the skin of the face, and in those situations which are naturally exposed to the influence of friction. The sebaceous substance when it collects in inordinate quantities within the excretory ducts becomes the habitat of a remarkable parasitic animal, the steatozoon folliculorum. The Sudoriparous glands are situated deeply in the corium and also in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, where they are surrounded by adipose cells. They are small oblong bodies, composed of one or more convohited tubuli, or of a congeries of globular sacs, which open into a common efferent duct. The latter ascends from the gland through the derma and epiderma, and terminates on the surface by a funnel-shaped and oblique aperture or pore. The efferent duct presents some variety in its course upwards : thus within the derma it is curved and serpentine, and if the epiderma be thin, it proceeds more or less directly to the excreting pore. Sometimes it is spirally curved within the derma, and having passed the latter, is regularly and beautifully spiral in its passage through the epiderma, the last turn forming an oblique and valvular opening on the surface. The spiral course of the duct is especially remarkable in the thick epiderma of the palm of the hand and sole of the foot. On those parts of the 0 0SUDORIFEROUS DUCTS, 562 skin where the papillae are irregularly distributed, the efferent ducts of the sudoriparous glands open on the surface also irregularly, while on the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet, the pores are situated at regular distances along the ridges, at points corre- sponding with the intervals of the small, square-shaped, clumps of papillEe. Indeed the apertures of the pores, seen upon the surface of the epidermal ridges, give rise to the appearance of small trans- verse furrows, which intersect the ridges from point to point. The efferent duct and the component sacs and tubuli of the sudori- parous gland are lined by an inflection of the epiderma. This inflec- tion is thick and infundibuliform in the upper stratum of the derma, but soon becomes uniform and soft. The infundibuliform projection is drawn out from the duct when the epiderma is removed, and may be perceived on the under surface of the latter as a nipple-shaped cone. A good view of the sudoriferous ducts is obtained by gently separating the epiderma of a portion of decomposing skin; or they may be better seen by scalding a piece of skin, and then withdrawing the epiderma from the derma. In both cases it is the lining sheath of epiderma which is drawn out from the duct.563 CHAPTER X. OF THE VISCEEA. That part of the science of anatomy which, treats of the viscera is named splanchnology, from the Greek v/ords airXayxvov, viscus, and \6joQ. The viscera of the human body are situated in the three great internal cavities; cranio-spinal, thorax, and abdomen. The viscera of the cranio-spinal cavity, namely, the brain and spinal cord, with the principal organs of sense, have been already described, in conjunction with the nervous system. The viscera of the chest are: the central organ of circulation, the heart; the organs of respiration, the lungs; and the thymus gland. The abdominal viscera admit of a subdivision into those which properly belong to that cavity, viz., the alimentary canal, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and supra-renal capsules; and those of the pelvis : the bladder and internal organs of generation. THOEAX. The thorax is the conical cavity, situated at the upper part of the trunk of the body; it is narrow above and broad below, and is bounded in front, by the sternum, six superior costal cartilages, ribs, and intercostal muscles; laterally, by the ribs and intercostal muscles; and, behind, by the ribs, intercostal muscles, and vertebral column, as low down as the upper border of the last rib and first lumbar vertebra; superiorly, by the first rib at each side, the upper part of the sternum in front and the first dorsal vertebra behind; and inferiorly, by the diaphragm. The superior opening of the thorax is closed by the thoracic fascia, and gives passage to the following parts, namely, the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and longi colli muscles; the trachea and cesophagus; the carotid and subclavian arteries and veins, and thoracic duct; the pneumogastric, phrenic, and sympathetic nerves; and the upper part of the lungs and pleurae. The cavity of the thorax is much deeper on the posterior than on the anterior wall, in consequence of the obliquity of the diaphragm, and contains the heart enclosed in its pericardium, with the great vessels; the lungs, with their serous coverings, the pleura; the* cesophagus; some important nerves; and, in the foetus, the thymus gland. THE HEART. The central organ of circulation, the heart, is situated between the two layers of pleura which constitute the mediastinum, and is enclosed in a proper membrane, the pericardium. 00 2564 PERICARDIUM.—HEART. Pericardium.—The pericardium is a fibro-serous membrane like the dura mater, and resembles that membrane also in deriving its serous layer from the reflected serous membrane of the viscus which it encloses. It consists, therefore, of two layers, an external fibrous and an internal serous. The fibrous layer is attached, above, to the great vessels proceeding from the heart, on which it is continuous with the thoracic fascia; and below, to the tendinous portion of the diaphragm. The serous membrane invests the heart with the com- mencement of its great vessels as high as the arch of the aorta, and is then reflected upon the internal surface of the fibrous layer. The Heart is placed obliquely in the chest, the base being directed upwards and backwards towards the right shoulder; the apeic forwards and to the left, pointing to the space between the fifth Fig. 193.* * Anatomy of the heart. 1.

Sur- mounting the ventricles are the corresponding auricles, whose auri- cular appendages are directed forwards, and slightly overlap the root of the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery is the large anterior vessel at the root of the heart; it crosses obliquely the commence- ment of the aorta. The heart consists of two auricles and two ventricles, which are respectively named, from their position, right and left. The right is the venous side of the heart; it receives into its auricle the venous blood from every part of the body, by the superior and inferior cava and coronary vein. From the auricle the blood passes into the ventricle, and from the ventricle through the pulmonary artery, to the capillaries of the lungs. From these it is returned as arterial blood to the left auricle; from the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle; and from the left ventricle is carried through the aorta, to be distributed to every part of the body, and again returned to the heart by the veins. This constitutes the course of the adidt circulation. The heart is best studied in situ. If, however, it be removed from the body, it should be placed in the position indicated by the above description of its situation. A transverse incision should then be made along the ventricular margin of the right auricle, from the appendix to its right border, and crossed by a perpendicular incision, carried from the side of the superior to the inferior cava. The blood must then be removed. Some fine specimens of white fibrin are frequently found with the coagula; occasionally they are yellow and gelatinous. This appearance deceived the older anatomists, who called these substances "polypus of the heart:" they are frequently found in the right ventricle, and sometimes in the left cavities. The Right Auricle is larger than the left, and consists of a principal cavity or sinus, and an appendix auriculae. The interior of the sinus presents for examination five openings; two valves; two relicts of foetal structure ; and two peculiarities in the proper structure of the auricle. To facilitate remembrance they may be thus arranged :—■ 19. Left ventricle. 20.

Its weight is about eleven ounces in the male, and nine ounces in the female.566 ANATOMY OF THE HEAKT.

Valves Eelicts of fcetal structure Structure of tlie auricle The Superior cava returns tlie blood from the upper half of the body, and opens into the upper and back part of the auricle. The Inferior cava returns the blood from the lower half of the body, and opens through the lower and posterior wall, close to the partition between the auricles (septum auricularum). The direction of these two vessels is such, that a stream forced through the superior cava would be directed towards the auriculo-ventricular opening. In like manner, a stream rushing upwards by the inferior cava would force its current against the septum auricularum; this is the proper direction of the two currents during fcetal life. The Coronary vein returns the venous blood from the substance of the heart; it opens into the auricle between the inferior cava and the auriculo-ventricular opening, under cover of the coronary valve. The Foramina Thehesii* are minute pore-like openings of small veins (vense minimse) which issue directly from the muscular struc- ture of the heart, without entering the venous current. These openings are also found in the left auricle, and in the right and left ventricles, but are generally believed to be mere csecal depressions. The Auriculo-ventricular opening is the large opening of commu- nication between the auricle and ventricle. The Eustachianf valve is a part of the apparatus of fcetal circula- tion, and serves to direct the placental blood from the inferior cava, through the foramen ovale into the left auricle. In the adult it is a mere vestige and imperfect, though sometimes it remains of large size. It is formed by a fold of the lining membrane of the auricle, containing some muscular fibres, is situated between the aperture of the inferior cava and the auriculo-ventricular opening, and is generally connected with the coronary valve. The Coronary valve is a semilunar fold of the lining membrane, * Adam Christian Thebesius.

The Tuherculum LowerV' is the portion of auricle intervening be- tween the openings of the superior and inferior cava.

Its anterior side is convex, and forms the larger portion of the front of the heart. The posterior side, which is also inferior, is flat, and rests upon the diaphragm ; the inner side corresponds with the partition between the two ventricles, septum ventriculorum. Superiorly where the pulmonary artery arises, there is a dilatation of the ventricle, termed the infundibulum or conus arteriosus. The right ventricle is to be laid open by making an incision parallel with, and a little to the right of, the anterior longitudinal furrow, from the pulmonary artery in front, to the apex of the heart, and thence by the side of the posterior longitudinal farrow behind to the auriculo-ventricular opening. It contains, to be examined, two openings, the auriculo-ventricular and that of the pulmonary artery; two apparatus of valves, the tri- cuspid and semilunar; and a muscular and tendinous apparatus belonging to the tricuspid valves. They may be thus arranged :— Auriculo-ventricular opening. Tricuspid valves, Opening of the pulmonary artery. Semilunar valves. Chordae tendinese, Carness columns. The A miculo-ventricular opening is surrounded by a fibrous ring, covered by the lining membrane (endocardium) of the heart. It is the opening of communication between the right auricle and ventricle. The Opening of the pulmonary artery is situated at the summit of the conus arteriosus, close to the septum ventriculorum, on the left side of the right ventricle, and upon the anterior aspect of the heart. The Tricuspid valves are three triangular folds of the lining mem- brane, strengthened by a thin layer of fibrous tissue. They are con- nected by their base around the auriculo-ventricular opening ; and by their sides and apices, which are thickened, they give attachment to a number of slender tendinous cords, called chordae tendine£e. The chordce tendinece are the tendons of the thick muscular columns ^* Richard Lower, M.D. " Tractatus de Corde; item de Motu et Colore Sanguinis," 1669. His dissections were made upon quadrupeds, and his observations relate rather to animals than man.569 RIGHT VENTRICLE. {columnce carnece) which stand out from the walls of the ventricle, and serve as muscles to the valves. A number of these tendinous cords converge to a single muscular attachment. The tricuspid valves prevent the regurgitation of blood into the auricle during the con- traction of the ventricle, and they are prevented from being them- selves driven back by the chordse tendineas and their muscular attachments. This connexion of the muscular columns of the heart to the valves has caused their division into active and passive. The active valves are the tricuspid and mitral; the passive, the semilunar and coro- nary. The valves consist, according to Mr. King,*of curtains, cords, and columns. The anterior valve or curtain is the largest, and is so placed as to prevent the filling of the pulmonary artery during the distention of the ventricle. The right valve or curtain is of smaller size, and is situated on the right side of the auriculo-ventricular opening. The third valve, or fixed curtain,'" is connected by its cords to the septum ventriculorum. The cords (chordas tendinese) of the anterior curtain are attached, principally, to a long column (columna carnea), which is connected with the "right or thin and yielding wall of the ventricle." From the lower part of this column a transverse muscular band, the ^Hong moderator hand," is stretched to the septum ventriculorum, or solid walV of the ventricle. The right curtain is connected, by means of its cords, partly with the long column, and partly with its own proper cohimn, the second column, which is also attached to the yielding walV of the ven- tricle. A third and smaller column is generally connected with the right curtain. The fixed curtain" is so named from its attachment to the solid wall" of the ventricle, by means of cords only, without fleshy columns. From this arrangement of the valves it follows, that if the right ventricle be over distended, the thin or ^'yielding wall" will give way, and carry with it the columns of the anterior and right valve. The cords connected with these colums will draw down the edges of the corresponding valves, and produce an opening between the curtains, through which the superabundant blood may escape into the auricle, and the ventricle be relieved from over-pressure. This mechanism is therefore adapted to fulfil the function of a " safety valve." The Columnce carnece (fleshy columns) is a name expressive of the appearance of the internal walls of the ventricles, which, with the exception of the infundibulum, seem formed of muscular columns interlacing in almost every direction. They are divided, according to the manner of their connection, into three sets. 1. The greater number are attached by the whole of one side, and merely form convexities into the cavity of the ventricle. 2. Others are connected * " Essay on the Safety-Valye Function in the Eight Ventricle of the Human Heart," by T. W. King.

A few (columnse papillares) are attaclied by one extremity to tbe walls of tbe beart, and by the other give insertion to the chordae tendinese. The Semilunar valves, three in number, are situated around the commencement of the pulmonary artery, being formed by a folding of its lining membrane, strengthened by a thin layer of fibrous tissue. They are attached by their convex borders, and free by the concave, which are directed upwards in the course of the vessel, so that, during the current of the blood along the artery, they are pressed against the sides of the cylinder ; but, if any attempt at regurgita- tion ensue, they are immediately expanded, and effectually close the entrance of the tube. The margins of the valves are thicker than the rest of their extent, and each valve presents in the centre of this margin a small fibro-cartilaginous tubercle or nodule, called corpus Arantii* which locks in with the other two during the closure of the valves, and secures the triangular space which would otherwise be left by the approximation of three semilunar folds. On either side of the nodule, the edge of the valve is folded and thin, and to this part the term lunula has been applied. When the valves are closed, the lunulse are brought in contact with each other by their surfaces. Between the semilunar valves and the cylinder of the artery are three pouches, called the pulmonary sinuses (sinuses of Valsalva). Similar sinuses are situated behind the valves at the commencement of the aorta, and are larger and more capacious than those of the pulmonary artery. The Pulmonary artery commences by a scalloped border, corre- sponding with the three valves which are attached along its edge. It is connected to the ventricle by muscular fibres, and by the lining membrane of the heart. The Left or posterior auricle is somewhat smaller, but thicker, than the right; of a cuboid form, and situated more pos- teriorly. The appendix auricula; is constricted at its junction with the auricle, and has a foliated appearance; it is directed forwards towards the root of the pulmonary artery, to which the auriculae of both sides appear to converge. The left auricle is to be laid open by a J. shaped incision, the horizontal section being made along the border which is attached to the base of the ventrisle. It presents for examination five openings, and the muscular structure of the appendix ; the fossa ovalis, as previously observed, is not to be seen on the left side of the septum auricularum. The parts to be examined, are,— Four pulmonary veins, Auriculo-ventricular opening, Musculi pectinati. * Julius Caesar Arantius, Professor of Medicine in Bologna. He was a disciple of Vesalius, one of the founders of modern anatomy. His treatise ' De Humano Foetu" was published at Rome, in 1564.571 LEFT AURICLE.—LEFT VENTRICLE. The Pulmonary veins, two from the right and two from the left lung, open into the corresponding sides of the auricle. The two left pulmonary veins terminate frequently by a common opening. The Auriculo-ventricular opening is the aperture of communi- cation between the auricle and ventricle. The Musculi pectinati are fewer in number than in the right auricle, and are situated only in the appendix auriculae. Left Ventricle.—The left ventricle is to be opened by making an incision a little to the left of the septum ventriculorum, and con- tinuing it around the apex of the heart to the auriculo-ventricular opening behind. The left ventricle is conical, both in external figure and in the Fig. 195.* * Anatomy of the heart; the organ is viewed on its left side. 1, CaTity of the left auricle.

It forms the apex of the heart, by pro- jecting heyond the right ventricle, while the latter has the advantage in length towards the base. Its walls are about seven lines in thick- ness, those of the right ventricle being about two lines and a half. It presents for examination, in its interior, two openings, two valves, and the tendinous cords and muscular columns ; they may be thus arranged:— The Auriculo-ventricular opening is a dense fibrous ring, covered by the endocardium, but smaller in size than that of the right side. Its fibrous structure is closely connected with that of the right auriculo-ventricular and aortic rings ; at the j auction of the three there is a fibro-cartilaginous mass, and, in some animals, a portion of bone. The Mitral valves are attached around the auriculo-ventricular opening, as are the tricuspid in the right ventricle. They are thicker than the tricuspid, and consist of two segments, of which the larger is placed between the auriculo-ventricular opening and the commencement of the aorta, and acts the part of a valve to that foramen during the filling of the ventricle. The difi'erence in size of the two valves, both being triangular, and the space between them, has given rise to the idea of a ^'bishoj)'s mitre" after which they were named. These valves, like the tricuspid, are furnished with an apparatus of tendinous cords, chordoi tendinece, which are attached to two very large columnce carnece. The Columnce carnece admit of the same arrangement into three kinds, as on the right side. Those which are free by one extremity, the columnse papillares, are two in number, and larger than those on the opposite side ; one being placed on the left wall of the ven- tricle, the other at the junction of the septum ventriculorum with the posterior wall. The Semilunar valves are placed around the commencement of the aorta, like those of the pulmonary artery; they are similar in struc- ture, and are attached to the scalloped border by which the aorta is connected with the ventricle. The nodule in the centre of each fold is larger than those of the pulmonary valves, and it was these that Arantius particularly described ; but the term corpora Arantii,''^ is now applied indiscriminately to both. The foss« between the semilunar valves and the cylinder of the artery are larger than those of the pulmonary artery; they are called the ' ^sinus aortici" (sinuses of Valsalva).

The arrangement of the fibres of the heart has been made the subject of careful investigation by Mr. Searle, to whose article, *'Fibres of the Heart," in the Cyclopsedia of Anatomy and Physio- logy, I am indebted for the following summary of their distribu- tion :— For the sake of clearness of description the fibres of the ventricles have been divided into three layers, superficial, middle, and internal, all of which are disposed in a spiral direction around the cavities of the ventricles. The mode of formation of these three layers will be best understood by adopting the plan pursued by Mr. Searle in tracing the course of the fibres from the centre of the heart towards its periphery. The left surface of the septum ventriculorum is formed by a broad and thick layer of fibres, which proceed backwards in a spiral direc- tion around the posterior aspect of the left ventricle, and become augmented on the left side of that ventricle by other fibres derived from the bases of the two columnse papillares. The broad and thick band formed by the fibres from these two sources, curves around the apex and lower third of the left ventricle to the anterior border of the septum, where it divides into two bands, a short or apicialband, and a long or basial band. The Short or apicial band is increased in thickness at this point by receiving a layer of fibres (derived from the root of the aorta and carnese columnse) upon its internal surface, from the right surface of the septum ventriculorum; it is then continued onwards in a spiral direction from left to right, around the lower third of the anterior surface, and the middle third of the posterior surface of the right ventricle to the posterior border of the septum. From the latter point the short band is prolonged around the posterior and outer border of the left ventricle to the anterior surface of the base of that ventricle, and is inserted into the anterior border of the left auriculo-ventricular ring and anterior part of the root of the aorta and pulmonary artery. The Long or basial band, at the anterior border of the septum, passes directly backwards through the septum (forming its middle layer), to the posterior ventricular groove, where it becomes joined by fibres derived from the root of the pulmonary artery. It then winds spirally around the middle and upper third of the left ven- tricle to the anterior border of the septum, where it is connected by means of its internal surface with the superior fibres derived from the aorta, which form part of the right wall of the septum. From this point it is continued around the upper third of the anterior and posterior surface of the right ventricle to the posterior border of the septum, where it is connected with the fibres constituting the right surface of the septum ventriculorum. At the latter point the fibres of this band begin to be twisted upon themselves, like the strands574 STRUCTURE OP THE HEART. of a rope, tlie direction of the twist being from below upwards. This arrangement of fibrosis called by Mr, Searle "the rope;" it is con- tinued spirally upwards, forming the brim of the left ventricle, to the anterior surface of the base of that ventricle, where the twisting of the fibres ceases. The long band then curves inwards towards the septum, and spreads out upon the left surface of the septum into the broad and thick layer of fibres with which this description commenced. The most inferior of the fibres of the left surface of the septum ventriculorum, after winding spirally around the internal surface of the apex of the left ventricle, so as to close its extremity, form a small fasciculus, which is excluded from the interior of the ventricle, and expands in a radiated manner over the surface of the heart, constituting its superficial layer of fibres. The direction of these fibres is, for the most part, oblique, passing from left to right on the anterior and from right to left on the posterior surface of the heart, becoming more longitudinal near its base, and terminating by being inserted into the fibrous rings of the auriculo'ventricular openings, and of the pulmonary artery and aorta. Over the right ventricle the superficial fibres are increased in number by the addi- tion of accessory fibres from the right surface of the septum, which pierce the middle layer, and take the same direction as the super- ficial fibres from the apex of the left ventricle, and of other acces- sory fibres from the surface of both ventricles. From this description it will be perceived that the superficial layer of fibres is very scanty, and is pretty equally distributed over the surface of both ventricles. The middle layer of both ventricles is formed by the two bands, short and long. But the internal layer of the two ventricles is very difierently constituted ; that of the left is formed by the spiral expansion of the fibres of the rope, and of the two columnse papillares; that of the right remains to be de- scribed. The septum ventriculorum also consists of three layers, a left layer, the radiated expansion of the rope and carnees columnse ; a middle layer, the long band ; and a right layer, belonging to the proper wall of the right ventricle, and continuous both in front and behind with the long band, and in front also with the short band, and with the superficial layer of the right ventricle. The Internal layer of the right ventricle is formed by fasciculi of fibres which arise from the right segment of the root of the aorta, from the entire circumference of the root of the pulmonary artery, and from the bases of the columnse papillares. The fibres from the root of the aorta, associated with some from the carnese columnse, constitute a layer which passes obliquely forwards upon the right side of the septum. The superior fibres coming directly from the aorta join the internal surface of the long band at the anterior border of the septum, while the lower two-thirds of the layer are continuous with the internal surface of the short band, some of its fibres piercing that band to augment the number of superficial fibres.575 FIBEES OF THE AUKICLES. The fibres derived from the root of the pulmonary artery, conjoined with those from the base of one of the columns papillares, curve forwards from their origin, and wind obliquely downwards and backwards around the internal surface of the wall of the ventricle to the posterior border of the septum, where they become continuous with the long band, directly that it has passed backwards through the septum. Fibres of the Auricles.—The fibres of the auricles are disposed in two layers, external and internal. The internal layer is formed of fasciculi which arise from the fibrous rings of the auriculo-ventricular openings, and proceed upwards to enlace with each other, and consti- tute the appendices auricularum. These fasciculi are parallel in their arrangement, and in the appendices form projections and give rise to the appearance which is denominated musculi pectinati. In their course they give off branches which connect adjoining fasciculi, and form a columnar interlacement between them. External Layer.—The fibres of the right auricle having completed the appendix, wind from left to right around the right border of this auricle, and along its anterior aspect, beneath the appendix, to the anterior surface of the septum. From the septum they are continued to the anterior surface of the left auricle, where they separate into three bands, superior, anterior, and posterior. The superior band proceeds onwards to the appendix, and encircles the apex of the auricle. The anterior hand passes to the left, beneath the appendix, and winds as a broad layer completely around the base of the auricle, and through the septum to the root of the aorta, to which it is partly attached, and from this point is continued onwards to the appendix, where its fibres terminate by interlacing with the musculi pectinati. The posterior hand crosses the left auricle obliquely to its posterior part, and winds from left to right around its base, encircling the open- ings of the pulmonary veins; some of its fibres are lost on the sur- face of the auricle, others are continued onwards to the base of the aorta; and a third set, forming a small band, are prolonged along the anterior edge of the appendix to its apex, where they are continuous with the superior hand. The septum auricularum has four sets of fibres entering into its formation; 1. The fibres arising from the auri- culo-ventricular rings at each side; 2. Fibres arising from the root of the aorta, which pass upwards to the transverse band, and to the root of the superior cava; 3. Those fibres of the anterior band that pass through the lower part of the septum in their course around the left auricle ; and, 4. A slender fasciculus, which crosses through the sep- tum from the posterior part of the right auriculo-ventricular ring to the left auricle. It will be remarked, from this description, that the left auricle is considerably thicker and more muscular than the right. The lining memhrane of the heart is termed endocardium; it is a thin, transparent membrane, but is more opake on the left side of the heart, where it is continuous with the internal coat of the pulmo-ANATOMY OP THE LAEYNX. 576 nary veins and aorta, than on the right side, where it is continued into the vense cavse and pulmonary artery. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries supplying the heart are the left and right coronary. The Veins accompany the arteries, and empty themselves by the common coronary vein into the right auricle. The lymphatics terminate in the glands about the root of the heart. The nerves of the heart are derived from the cardiac plexuses, which are formed by communicating filaments from the sympathetic and pneumogastric. ORGANS OF RESPIRATION AND VOICE. The organs of respiration are the two lungs, with their air-tube, the trachea, to the upper part of which is adapted an apparatus of cartilages, constituting the organ of voice, or larynx. THE LARYNX. The Larynx is situated at the fore-part of the neck, between the trachea and the base of the tongue. It is a short tube, having an hour-glass form, and is composed of cartilages, ligaments, muscles, vessels, nerves, and mucous membrane. The Cartilages are the— Thyroid, Two cornicula laryngis, Cricoid, Two cuneiform, Two arytenoid, Epiglottis. The Thyroid {Bvpebg—eWog, like a shield) is the largest cartilage of the larynx: it consists of two lateral portions, or alee, which meet at an angle in front, and form the projection which is known by the name of pomum Aclami. In the male, after puberty, the angle of union of the two alse is acute : in the female, and before puberty in the male, it is obtuse. Where the pomum Adami is prominent, a bursa mucosa is often found between it and the skin. Each ala is quadrilateral in shape, and forms a rounded border posteriorly, which terminates above, in the superior cornu, and below, in the inferior cornu. Upon the side of the ala is an oblique line, or ridge, directed downwards and forwards, and bounded at each extremity by a tubercle. Into this line the sterno-thyroid muscle is inserted; and from it the thyro-hyoid and inferior con- strictor take their origin. In the receding angle, formed by the meeting of the two alse, upon the inner side of the cartilage, and near its lower border, are attached the epiglottis, chordse vocales, thyro-arytenoid and thyro-epiglottidean muscles. The Cricoid {Kp'iKog—eISoq, like a ring) is a ring of cartilage, narrow in front, and broad behind where it is surmounted by two rounded surfaces, which articulate with the arytenoid cartilages.577 CARTILAGES OF THE LARYNX. At the middle line, posteriorly, is a vertical ridge which gives attachment to the ossophagii^, and on each side of the ridge are the depressions which lodge the crico-arytenoidei postici muscles. On either side of the ring is a glenoid cavity, which articulates with the inferior comu of the thyroid cartilage. The Arytenoid cartilages {dpvTaiva,^ a pitcher), two in number, are triangular and prismoid in form. , They are broad and thick below, where they articulate with the tipper border of the cricoid cartilage; pointed above, and prolonged by two small pyriform fibro- cartilages, cornicula laryngis {capitula Santorini), which are curved inwards and backwards; and they each present three surfaces, anterior, posterior, and internal. The posterior surface is concave, and lodges part of the arytenoideus muscle; the internal surface is smooth, and forms part of the lateral wall of the larynx : the anterior or external surface is rough and uneven, and gives attach- ment to the chorda vocalis, thyro-arytenoideus, crico-arytenoideus lateralis and posticus, and, above these, to the base of the cuneiform cartilage. The Cuneiform cartilages are two small cylinders of yellow fibro- cartilage, about seven lines in length, and enlarged at each extremity. By ^he lower end, or base, the cartilage is attached to the middle of the ' external surface of the arytenoid, and by its upper extremity forms a prominence in the border of the aryteno-epiglottidean fold of membrane. They are sometimes wanting. In the male, the cartilages of the larynx are more or less ossified, particularly in old age. The Epiglottis {iTTLyXiorriQ, upon the tongue) is a fibro-cartilage of a yellowish colour, studded with a number of small mucous glands, which are lodged in shallow pits upon its surface. It is shaped like a cordate leaf, and is placed immediately in front of the opening of the larynx, which it closes completely when the larynx is drawn up beneath the base of the tongue. It is attached by its point to the receding angle between the two alas of the thyroid cartilage. Ligaments.—The ligaments of the larynx are numerous, and may be arranged into four groups : 1. Those which articulate the thyroid with the OS hyoides. 2. Those which connect it with the cricoid. 3. Ligaments of the arytenoid cartilages. 4. Ligaments of the epiglottis. 1. The ligaments which connect the thyroid cartilage with the os hyoides are three in number. The two Thyro-hyoidean ligaw.ents pass between the superior cornua of the thyroid and the extremities of the greater cornua of the OS hyoides: a sesamoid bone or cartilage is found in each. * This derivation has reference to the appearance of both cartilages taken together and covered by mucous membrane. In animals, which were the principal sul^jects of dissection among the ancients, the opening of the larynx with the arytenoid cartilages bears a striking resemblance to the mouth of a pitcher having a large spout. P PLIGAMENTS OP THE LARYNX. 578 The Thyro-hyaidean membrane is a broad membranous layer, occupying the entire space between the upper border of the thyroid cartilage and the upper border of the os hyoides.

It is attached by ^P^'Mf^i' ^ apex to the lower border and Wt/Kj]j> receding angle of the thyroid car- W^mF il tilage, and by its expanded margin to the upper border of the cricoid and base of the arytenoid carti- lages. Superiorly it is continuous with the inferior margin of the chordae vocales. The front of the crico-thyroidean membrane is crossed by a small artery, the in- ferior laryngeal, and is the spot selected for the operation of laryn- gotomy. Laterally it is covered in by the crico-thyroidei and crico- arytenoidei laterales muscles.LIGAMENTS OF THE LARYNX. 579 3. The ligaments of the arytenoid cartilages are eight in number:— Two Capsular ligaments, with synovial membranes, which arti- culate the arytenoid cartilages with the cricoid, strengthened behind by two posterior crico-arytenoid bands or ligaments; and the superior and inferior thyro-arytenoid ligaments. The superior thyro-arytenoid ligaments are two thin bands of yellow elastic tissue which are attached in front to the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the anterior and inner border of each arytenoid cartilage. The lower border of this ligament constitutes the upper boundary of the ventricle of the larynx, and the fold of mucous membrane caused by its projection has been called the superior or false chorda vocalis. The inferior thyro-arytenoid ligaments, or true chordce vocales, are thicker than the superior, and like them composed of yellow elastic tissue. Each ligament is attached in front to the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the anterior angle of the base of the arytenoid. The inferior border of the chorda vocalis is continuous with the lateral expansion of the crico-thyroid ligament. The superior border forms the lower boundary of the ventricle of the larynx. The space between the two chordae vocales is the glottis or rima glottidis. 4. The ligaments of the epiglottis are • five in number, namely, three glosso-epiglottic, hyo-epiglottic, and thyro-epiglottic. The glosso-epiglottic ligaments (frsena epiglottidis) are three folds of mucous membrane, which connect the anterior surface of the epiglottis with the root of the tongue. The middle of these con- tains elastic tissue. The hyo-epiglottic ligament is a band of yellow elastic tissue passing between the anterior as- pect of the epiglottis near its apex, and the upper margin of the body of the os hyoides. The thyro-epiglottic ligament is a long and slender fasciculus of yellow elastic tissue, which embraces the apex of the epiglottis, and is inserted into the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage immediately below the an- terior fissure and above the attachment of the chordae vocales.

The five muscles of the chordae vocales and rima glottidis are, the— Crico -thyroid, Thyro - arytenoideus, Crico-arytenoideus posticus, Arytenoideus. Crico-arytenoideus lateralis, The Crico-thyroid muscle arises from the anterior surface of the cricoid cartilage, and passes obliquely outwards and backwards to be inserted into the lower and inner border of the ala of the thyroid from its tubercle as far back as the inferior cornu. The Crico-arytenoideus posticus arises from the depression on the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage, and passes upv/ards and outwards to be inserted into the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid. The Crico-arytenoideus lateralis arises from the upper border of the side of the cricoid, and passes upwards and backwards to be inserted into the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. The Thyro-arytenoideus arises from the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, close to the outer side of the chorda vocalis, and passes backwards parallel with the cord, to be inserted into the base and outer surface of the arytenoid cartilage. The Arytenoideus mxiBc\e occupies the posterior concave surface of the arytenoid cartilages, between which it is stretched. It consists of three planes of transverse and oblique fibres ; hence it was formerly considered as several muscles, under the names of transversi and ohliqui. The three muscles of the epiglottis are the— Thyro-epiglottideus, Aryteno-epiglottideus superior, Aryteno-epiglottideus inferior. The Thyro-epiglottideus appears to be formed by the upper fibres of the thyro- arytenoideus muscle ; theyspread out upon the external surface of thesacculus laryngis and in the aryteno-epiglot- tidean fold of mucous membrane, on which they are lost; a few of the anterior fibres being continued onwards to the side of the epiglottis (depressor epiglottidis). * Side \iew of the larynx, one ala of the thyroid cartilage has been removed. 1.

The Aryteno-epiglottideus inferior.—This muscle, described by Mr. Hilton, and closely connected with the sacculus laryngis, may be found by raising the mucous membrane immediately above the ventricle of the larynx. It arises by a narrow and fibrous origin from the arytenoid cartilage, just above the attachment of the chorda vocalis; and passing forwards and a little upwards, expands over the upper half or two-thirds of the sacculus laryngis, and is inserted by a broad attachment into the side of the epiglottis. Actions.—From a careful examination of the muscles of the larynx, Mr. Bishop* concludes, that the crico-arytenoidei postici open the glottis, while all the rest close it. The arytenoideus ap- proximates the arytenoid cartilages posteriorly, and the crico- arytenoidei laterales and thyro-arytenoidei anteriorly ; the latter, moreover, close the glottis mesially. The crico-thyroidei are tensors of the chordse vocales, and these muscles, together with the thyro- arytenoidei, regulate the tension, position, and vibrating length of the vocal cords. ^he crico-thyroid muscles effect the tension of the chordae vocales by rotating the cricoid on the inferior comua of the thyroid; by this action the anterior portion is drawn upwards and made to approxi- mate the inferior border of the thyroid, while the posterior and superior border of the cricoid, together with the arytenoid cartilages, is carried backwards. The crico-arytenoidei postici separate the chordje vocales by drawing the outer angles of the arytenoid carti- lages outwards and downwards. The crico-arytenoidei laterales, by drawing the outer angles of the arytenoid cartilages forwards, ap- proximate the anterior angles to which the chordae vocales are attached. The thyro-arytenoidei draw the arytenoid cartilages for- wards, and, by their connexion with the chordae vocales, act upon the whole length of those cords. The thyro-epiglottideus acts principally by compressing the glands of the sacculus laryngis and the sac itself: by its attachment to the epiglottis it would act feebly upon that valve. The aryteno-epi- glottideus superior serves to keep the mucous membrane of the sides of the opening of the glottis tense, when the larynx is drawn up- wards and the opening closed by the epiglottis. Of the aryteno- epiglottideus, the "functions appear to be," writes Mr. Hilton, "to compress the subjacent glands which open into the pouch ; to diminish the capacity of that cavity, and change its form ; and to approximate the epiglottis and the arytenoid cartilage." Mucous Membrane.—The aperture of the larynx is a triangular or cordiform opening, broad in front and narrow behind ; bounded ante-» * Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology, art.

On the margin of this aryteno-epiglottidean fold the cuneiform cartilage forms a prominence more or less distinct. The cavity of the larynx is divided into two parts by an oblong constriction produced by the prominence of the chordae vocales. That portion of the cavity which lies above the constriction is broad and triangular above, and narrow below; that which is below it, is narrow above and broad and cylin- drical below, the circumference of the cylinder corresponding with the ring of the cricoid ; while the space included by the constriction is a narrow, triangular fissure, the glottis or rima glottidis. The form of the glottis is that of an isosceles triangle, bounded on the sides by the chordse vocales and inner surface of the arytenoid cartilages, and behind by the arytenoideus muscle. Its length is greater in the male than in the female, and in the former measures somewhat less than an inch. Immediately above the prominence caused by the chorda vocalis, and extending nearly its entire length on each side of the cavity of the larynx, is an elliptical fossa, the ventricle of the larynx. This fossa is bounded below by the chorda vocalis, which it serves to isolate, and above by a border of mucous membrane folded upon the lower edge of the superior thyro-arytenoid ligament (superior or false chorda vocalis). The whole of the cavity of the larynx, with its prominences and depressions, is lined by mucous membrane, which is continuous superiorly with that of the mouth and pharynx, and inferiorly is prolonged through the trachea and bronchial tubes into the lungs. In the ventricles of the larynx the mucous membrane forms a csecal pouch of variable size, termed by Mr. Hilton the sacculus laryngis.*' The sacculus laryngis is directed upwards, sometimes extending as high as the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and occasionally above that border. When * This sac was described by Mr. Hilton before lie was aware that it had ah-eady been pointed out by the older anatomists. I myself made a dissec- tion, which I still possess, of the same sac in an enlarged state, during the month of August, 1837, without any knowledge either of Mr. Hilton's labours or Morgagni's account. The sac projected considerably above the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and the extremity had been snipped oif on one side, in the removal of the muscles. The larynx was presented to me by Dr. G-eorge Moore of CamberweU; he had obtained it from a child who died of bronchial disease; and he conceived that this peculiar disposition of the mucous membrane might possibly explain some of the symptoms by which the case was accompanied. Cruveilhier made the same observation in equal ignorance of Morgagni's description, for we read in a note at page 677, vol. ii. of his Anatoviie Descriptive,-—" J'ai vu pour la premiere fois eette arridre cavite chez un individu atFecte de i^hthisie laryngee, oil eUe etait tres- developpee. Je fis des recherches sur le larynx d'autres individus, et je trouvai que cette disposition etait constante. Je ne savais pas alors que Morgagni avait indique et fait representer la meme disposition." Cruveilhier com- pares its form very aptly to a Fhrygian casque," and Morgagni's figure, Advers. 1. Epist. Anat. 3. plate 2. fig. 4, has the same appearance. But neither of these anatomists notice the follicular glands described by Mr. Hilton.THE TRACHEA. 583 dissected from the interior of the larynx it is found covered by the aryteno-epiglottideus muscle and a fibrous membrane, which latter is attached to the superior thyro-arytenoid ligament below; to the epiglottis in front; and to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage above. If examined from the exterior of the larynx, it will be seen to be covered by the thyro-epiglottideus muscle. On the surface of its mucous membrane are the openings of sixty or seventy small follicular glands, which are situated in the sub-mucous tissue, and give to its external surface a rough and ill-dissected appearance. The secretion from these glands is intended for the lubrication of the chordae vocales, and is directed upon them by two small valvular folds of mucous membrane, which are situated at the entrance of the sacculus. The mucous membrane is closely connected to the epiglottis and to the chordae vocales, on the latter being remarkable for its thinness. It is invested by a columnar ciliated epithelium as high up as the superior folds of the ventricle of the larynx and lower half of the epiglottis. Glands.—The mucous membrane of the larynx is furnished with an abundance of mucous glands; many of these are situated on the epiglottis, in the sacculus laryngis, and in the aryteno-epiglottidean folds, where they are termed arytenoid. The body known as the epiglottic gland is merely a mass of cellular and adipose tissue, situated in the triangular space between the front surface of the apex of the epiglottis, the hyo-epiglottidean and the thyro-hyoidean Hgament, Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the larynx are derived from the superior and inferior thyroid. The nerves are the superior laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal; both branches of the pneumo- gastric. The two nerves communicate with each other freely; but the superior laryngeal is distributed principally to the mucous mem- brane at the entrance of the larynx; the recurrent, to the muscles. THE TRACHEA. The Trachea or wind-pipe is cylindrical for about two-thirds of its circumference, and flattened on the posterior third, where it rests on the oesophagus ; it extends from opposite the fifth cervical vertebra to opposite the third dorsal, where it divides into the two bronchi. The length of the trachea is about four inches, and its diameter from side to side nearly an inch ; it is somewhat larger in the male than in the female. The right bronchus, larger than the left, passes off nearly at right angles, to the upper part of the corresponding lung. The left descends obliquely, and passes beneath the arch of the aorta, to reach the left lung. It is composed of cartilaginous rings, fibrous membrane, muscular fibres, fibres of elastic fibrous tissue, and is lined by mucous membrane. The Cartilaginous rings are from fifteen to twenty in number, and extend for two-thirds around its cylinder, being deficient at theTHYROID GLAND. 584 posterior part. The first ring is received within the lower margin of the cricoid cartilage, and is broader than the rest; the last is broad at the middle in consequence of the prolongation of the lower border into a triangular process which curves backwards at the point of bifurcation. The posterior extremities of the rings are rounded, and occasionally one or two rings will be found to bifurcate. The Fibrous membrane connects the rings and forms a thin covering to them on the outer surface. Internally it does not reach the surface, and the rings have in consequence an appearance of greater prominence. It also stretches across between the rings on the posterior part of the trachea. The Muscular fibres are disposed transversely across the space, between the extremities of the rings behind. They are placed in- ternally to the fibrous membrane. The Elastic fibrous tissue is disposed in longitudinal bundles, within the rings ; and, behind, internally to the muscular layer. The Mucous membrane, which is pale, forms the internal lining of the tube, find has opening upon its surface the excretory tubes of numerous mucous glands. The Mucous glands are small ovoid bodies situated externally to the fibrous membrane, and between that membrane and the muscular layer behind, and in the substance of the fibrous membrane between the rings. Their ducts open upon the mucous membrane. THYROID GLAND. The thyroid gland or body is one of those organs which it is dif&cult to classify, from the absence of any positive knowledge with regard to its function. It is situated upon the trachea, and in an anatomical arrangement may therefore be considered in this place, although bearing no part in the function of respiration. This gland consists of two lobes, which are placed one on each side of the trachea, and are connected with each other by means of an isthmus, which crosses its upper rings, usually the third and fourth ; but in this respect there is some variety, a point necessary to be re- membered in operations on the trachea. The lobes are somewhat conical in shape, being larger below than above, and the smaller end is continued upwards to the side of the thyroid cartilage. The isthmus is connected with the lower third of the two lobes, and often gives origin to a process of variable length and size, called the pyra- mid or third lobe. The pyramid is generally situated on the left side of the isthmus and is sometimes derived from the left lobe. The left lobe is somewhat smaller than the right, the weight of the entire gland being about one ounce and a half. It is, however, larger in young persons and females than in adult males, and undergoes a slight increase during menstruation. Its permanent enlargement constitutes bronchocele, goitre, or the Derbyshire neck. The structure of the thyroid is of a brownish-red colour, and is composed of a dense aggregation of minute and independent mem-THE LUNGS. 585 branous cavities enclosed by a plexus of capillary vessels, and con- nected together by cellular tissue. The cavities are filled with a yellowish fluid, in which are found cytoblasts and cells; the latter measuring y-^^^ of an inch in diameter. In young animals the cytoblasts lie in contact with the internal wall of the cavities, and constitute a kind of tesselated epithelium.* A muscle is occasionally found connected with its isthmus, or with the pyramid, and is attached, superiorly, to the body of the os hyoides, or to the thyroid cartilage. It was named by Soemmering the levator glaridulce thyroidece/''^g. 196. Vessels a,nd Nerves.—It is abundantly supplied with blood by the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. Sometimes an additional artery is derived from the arteria innominata, and ascends upon the front of the trachea to be distributed to the gland. The wounding of the latter vessel, in tracheotomy, might be fatal to the patient. The nerves are derived from the superior laryngeal and from the middle and inferior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic. THE LUNGS. The lungs are two conical organs, situated one on each side of the chest, embracing the heart, and separated from each other by that org^^n and by a membranous partition, the mediastinum. On the external or thoracic side they are convex, and correspond with the form of the cavity of the chest; internally they are concave, to receive the convexity of the heart. Superiorly they terminate in a tapering cone, which extends above the level of the first rib into the root of the neck, and inferiorly they are broad and concave, and rest upon the convex surface of the diaphragm. Their posterior border is rounded, broad, and long ; the anterior, sharp, short, and marked by one or two deep fissures; and the inferior border which surrounds the base is also sharp. The colour of the lungs is pinkish-grey, mottled, and variously marked with black. The surface is figured with irregularly polyhedral outlines, which represent the lobules of the organ, and the area of each of these polyhedral spaces is crossed by lighter lines representing smaller lobules. The weight of the lungs is about forty ounces, the right lung being two ounces heavier than the left. Each lung is divided into two lobes, by a long and deep fissure, which extends from the posterior surface of the upper part of the organ, downwards and forwards to near the anterior angle of its base. In the right lung the upper lobe is subdi vided by a second fissure, which extends obliquely forward from the middle of the preceding to the anterior border of the organ, and marks off a small triangular lobe. The left lung presents a deep notch in its anterior border, at a point corresponding with the apex of the heart. * Simon on the Comparative Anatomy of the Thyroid Gland. PMo- sopMcal Transactions, 1844.ANATOMY OF THE LUNGS. 586 The right lung is larger than the left, in consequence of the in- clination of the heart to the left side. It is also shorter, from the great convexity of the liver, which presses the diaphragm upwards upon the right side of the chest considerably above the level of the left; and it has three lobes. The left lung is smaller, has but two lobes, but is longer than the right. Each lung is retained in its place by its root, which is formed by the pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins and bronchial tubes, together with the bronchial vessels and pulmonary plexuses of nerves. The groove on the surface of the lung where the vessels enter its substance is the hilum pulmonis ; and the position of the large vessels in the Fig. 199* * Anatomy of the heart and lungs. 1.

Pulmonary veins, Pulmonary artery. Bronchus. From above, downwards, on the right side, this order is exactly reversed; but on the left side, the bronchus has to stoop beneath the arch of the aorta, which alters its position to the vessels. They are thus disposed on the two sides:— Right. Left. Bronchus, Artery, Artery, Bronchus, Veins. Veins. The special relations of the roots of the lung are, for the right, the descending cava, which lies in front, and the vena azygos, which arches over it from behind to terminate in the superior vena cava. The root of the left lung has the descending aorta lying behind it. Structure.—The lungs are composed of the ramifications of the bronchial tubes (bronchia), which terminate in intercellular passages and air-cells, of the ramifications of the pulmonary arteries and veins, bronchial arteries and veins, lymphatics, and nerves; the whojle of these structures, being held together by cellular tissue, constitute the parenchyma. The parenchyma of the lungs, when examined on the surface or by means of a section, is seen to consist of small polyhedral divisions, or lobules, which are connected to each other by an inter-lobular cellular tissue. These lobules again cotisist of smaller lobules, and the latter are formed by a cluster of air-cells, in the parietes of which the capillaries of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins are distributed. Each lobule, taken alone, is provided with its separate bronchial tube, pulmonary artery and vein, and is isolated from surrounding lobules by a pro- cess of cellular membrane derived from the subserous tissue; the entire lung is an assemblage of these lobules, so separated and so connected, held together by the pleura. The serous investing membrane of the lungs or pleura is connected with the surface of the lobules by means of a subserous cellular tissue, which forms a distinct layer, and being prolonged between the lobules, is the bond of adhesion between them. This layer contains elastic tissue, and is a chief source of the elasticity of the lungs; its interstices are moistened by a serous secretion, and are unincumbered with fat. Bronchial Tubes.—The two bronchi proceed from the bifurcation of the trachea opposite the third dorsal vertebra to their corre- sponding lungs. The right, about an inch long, takes its course nearly at right angles with the trachea, and enters the upper part of the right lung; while the left, two inches in length, and smaller than the right, passes obliquely beneath the arch of the aorta, and enters the lung at about the middle of its root. Upon entering the lungs, they divide into two branches, and each of these divides and subdivides588 BRONCHIAL TUBES. dichotomously to their ultimate termination in the intercellular pas- sages and air-cells. According to Mr. Rainey, * the bronchial tubes continue to diminish in size until they attain a diameter of to of an inch, and arrive within ^ of an inch of the surface of the lung. They then become changed in structure, and are continued onwards in the midst of air- cells, under the name of intercellular passages. Lastly, the inter- Mg. 200.t cellular passages, after several bifurcations, terminate, each by a caecal extremity or air-cell. The intercellular passages are at first cylindrical, like the bron- chial tubes, but soon become ir- regular in shape from the great number of air-cells which open into them on all sides. The air- cells in the adult lung measure between and ytj of inch, they are irregular in shape, and, most frequently, four-sided cavi- ties, separated by thin septa, and communicating freely with the intercellular passages, and sparingly with the bronchial tubes. In structure the bronchial tubes are composed of cartilages, fibrous membrane, muscular fibres, elastic fibres, and mucous membrane. The cartilages in the primary bronchi are six or eight in number in the right bronchus, and ten or twelve in the left. In the subse- quent divisions of the bronchial tubes, which are cylindrical in figure, the cartilages assume the form of thin plates of irregular shape and size, adapted to each other by their edges, and completely surrounding the tubes. The plates are most strongly developed around the bifurcations of the tubes, and the point of division is furnished with a cartilage of a semilunar form. They are found entering into the structure of the bronchial tubes until the latter are reduced to a quarter of a line in diameter, and are then lost. The fibrous membrane, wliich enters largely into the formation of the trachea and bronchial tubes, is the principal coat of the smallest tubes, and is continued to their terminations in the intercellular passages and air-cells. The muscular fibres, belonging to the class of non-striated or organic muscle, are arranged in rings around the tube, and form a muscular coat which is placed externally to the cartilaginous plates * Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. xxviii. t A diagram showing the dilatation of the ultimate bronchial tubes into intercellular passages, and the enlargement of the latter near the surface of the lung, a, a.

The elastic fibres, arranged in longitudinal fasciculi, form a thin stratum situated next the mucous lining; this elastic coat is prolonged to the ends of the tubes, and scattered fibres are found around the intercellular passages and cells. The mucous membrane, lining the bronchial tubes, is pro- vided with a ciliated columnar, epithelium as far as their termina- tion ; but in the intercellular passages and air-cells it is altered in its characters, is thin and transparent, and coated with a squamous epithelium. The capillaries of the lungs form plexuses which occupy the walls and septa of the air-cells and the walls of the intercellular passages, but are not continued into the bronchial tubes. The septa between the cells consist of a single layer of the capillary plexus enclosed in a fold of the mucous lining membrane. The cells of the central parts of the lung are most vascular, and at the same time smallest, while those of the periphery are less vascular and larger. The pigmentary matter of the lungs is contained in the air-cells, as well as in the cellular tissue of the inter-lobular spaces and of the blood-vessels; it is composed chiefly of carbon. The Pulmonary artery, conveying the dark and impure venous blood to the lungs, terminates in capillary vessels, which form a dense network in the parietes of the intercellular passages and air- cells, and then converge to form the pulm.onary veins, by which the arterial blood, purified in its passage through the capillaries, is re- turned to the left auricle of the heart. The Bronchial arteries, branches of the thoracic aorta, ramify on the parietes of the bronchial tubes, and terminate partly in bronchial veins which convey the venous blood to the vena azygos on the right side, and the superior intercostal vein on the left; and partly in the pulmonary capillaries. The Lymphatics, commencing on the surface and in the substance of the lungs, terminate in the bronchial glands. These glands, very numerous and often of large size, are placed at the roots of the lungs, around the bronchi, and at the bifurcation of the trachea. In early life they resemble lymphatic glands in other situations; but in old age, and often in the adult, are black, and filled with carbonaceous matter, and occasionally with calcareous deposits. The Nerves are derived from the pneumogastric and sympathetic. They form two plexuses : anterior 'pulmonary plexus, situated upon the front of the root of the lungs, and composed chiefly of filaments from the deep cardiac plexus ; and posterior pulmonary plexus, on the posterior aspect of the root of the lungs, composed principally of branches from the pneumogastric. The branches from these plexuses follow the course of the bronchial tubes, and are distributed to the intercellular passages and air-cells.590 PLEURiE. Each, lung is enclosed, and its strncture maintained, by a serous membrane, the pleura, which invests it as far as the root, and is then reflected upon the parietes of the chest. That portion of the mem- brane which is in relation with the lung is csdled pleura ptdmonalis, and that in contact with the parietes, p>l€.ura costalis. The reflected portion, besides forming the internal lining to the ribs and intercostal muscles, also covers the diaphragm and the thoracic surface of the vessels at the root of the neck, extending for somewhat more than an inch above the margin of the first rib. At the lower border of the root of the lung is a fold of the pleura, which extends down by the side of the posterior mediastinum to the diaphragm, and serves to retain the lower part of the lung in position. This fold is the broad ligament of the lung, ligamentum latum pulmonis. On its external surface, where the pleura is connected with sur- rounding parts, it is rough; on its inner surface, smooth. On the right side, where the diaphragm is pressed upwards by the liver, the pleura is shorter than on the left, but extends higher into the neck; while the left pleura, in consequence of the encroachment of the heart upon the left side of the chest, is narrower than the right. MEDIASTINUM. The approximation of the two reflected pleurse in the middle line of the thorax forms a septum, which divides the chest into the two pulmonary cavities. This is the mediastinum. The two pleurae are not, however, in contact with each other at the middle line in the formation of the mediastinum, but have a space between them which contains all the viscera of the chest with the exception of the lungs. The mediastinum is divided into the anterior, middle, and ptosterior. The Anterior mediastinum is a triangular space, bounded in front by the sternum, and on each side by the pleura. It contains a quantity of loose cellular tissue, in which are found some lymphatic vessels passing upwards from the liver, the remains of the thymus gland, the origins of the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and left trian- gularis sterni muscle, and the left internal mammary vessels. . The Middle 7nediastinum contains the heart enclosed in its peri- cardium ; the ascending aorta; the superior vena cava; the pulmo- nary arteries and veins; the bifurcation of the trachea; and the phrenic nerves. The Posterior mediastinum is bounded behind by the vertebral column, in front by the pericardium, and on each side by the pleura. It contains the aorta; the greater and lesser azygos vein the superior intercostal veins; the thoracic duct; the oesophagus and pneumogastric nerves, and the great splanchnic nerves.591 ABDOMEN. The abdomen is the inferior cavity of the trunk of the body; it is bounded in front and at the sides by the lower*ribs and abdominal muscles; behind, by the vertebral column and abdominal muscles; above, by the diaphragm; and, below, by the pelvis; and contains, the alimentary canal, the organs subservient to digestion, viz. the Fig. 201.* * Viscera of the abdomen in situ. 1, 1.

Regions.—For convenience of description of the viscera, and of reference to the morbid affections of this cavity, the abdomen is divided into certain districts or regions. Thus, if two transverse lines be carried around the body, the one parallel with the cartilages of the eighth ribs, the other with the highest point of the crests of the ilia, the abdomen will be divided into three zones. Again, if a per- pendicular line be drawn, at each side, from the cartilage of the eighth rib to the middle of Poupart's ligament, the three primary zones will each be subdivided into three compartments or regions, middle and two lateral. The middle region of the upper zone being immediately over the small end of the stomach, is called epigastric {IttI yaoTrip, over the stomach). The tv/o lateral regions, being under the cartilages of the ribs, are called hypochondriac {vtto xovSpoi, under the cartilages). The middle region of the middle zone is the urabilical; the two lateral, the lumbar. The middle region of the inferior zone is the hypogastric {vtto yaarrjp, below the stomach); and the two lateral, the iliac. In addition to these divisions, we employ the term inguinal region, in reference to the vicinity of Poupart's ligament. Position of the Viscera.—In the iipper zone will be seen the liver, extending across from the right to the left side; the stomach and spleen on the left, and the pancreas and duodenum behind. In the middle zone is the transverse portion of the colon, with the upper part of the ascending and descending colon, omentum, small intes- tines, mesentery, and, behind, the kidneys and supra-renal capsules. In the inferior zone is the lower part of the omentum and small in- testines, the csecum, ascending and descending colon with the sigmoid flexure, and ureters. The smooth and polished surface, which the viscera and parietes of the abdomen present, is due to the peritoneum. PERITONEUM. The Peritoneum (Trepirelveiv, to extend around) is a serous mem- brane, and therefore, a shut sac; a single exception exists in the human subject to this character, viz,, in the female, where the peri- toneum is perforated by the open extremities of the Fallopian tubes, and is continuous with their mucous lining. The simplest idea that can be given of a serous membrane, which may apply equally to all, is, that it invests the viscus or viscera, and is then reflected upon the parietes of the containing cavity. If the cavity contain only a single viscus, the consideration of the serous membrane is extremely simple. But in the abdomen, where there are a number of viscera, the serous membrane passes from one to the other until it has invested the whole, before it is reflected on the parietes. Hence its reflexions are a little more complicated.593 PERITONEUM. In tracing the reflexions of tlie peritoneum, in the middle line, we commence with the diaphragm, which is lined by two layers, one from the parietes in front, anterior, and one from the parietes behind, posterior. These two layers of the same membrane, at the posterior part of the diaphragm, descend to the upper surface of the liver, forming the coronary and lateral ligaments of the liver. They then surround the liver, one going in front, the other behind that viscus, and, meeting at its under surface, pass to the stomach, forming the lesser omentum. They then, in the same manner, surround the stomach, and, meeting at its lower border, descend for some distance in front of the intestines, and return to the transverse colon, forming the great omentum; they then surround the transverse colon, and pass directly backwards to the vertebral column, forming the trans- verse meso-colon. Here the two layers separate ; the posterior as- cends in front of the pancreas and aorta, and returns to the poste- rior part of the diaphragm, where it becomes the posterior layer with which we commenced. The anterior descends, invests all the small intestines, and returning to the vertebral column, forms the mesentery. It then descends into the pelvis in front of the rectum, which it holds in its place by means of a fold called meso-rectum, forms a pouch, the recto-vesical fold, between the rectum and the bladder, ascends upon the posterior surface of the bladder, forming its Mse ligaments, and returns upon the anterior parietes of the abdomen to the diaphragm, whence we first traced it. In the female, after descending into the pelvis in front of the rectum, it is reflected upon the posterior surface of the vagina and uteirus. It then descends on the anterior surface of the uterus, and forms at either side the broad ligaments of that organ. From the uterus it ascends upon the posterior surface of the bladder, and anterior parietes of the abdomen, and is continued, as in the male, to the diaphragm. In this way the continuity of the peritoneum, as a whole, is dis- tinctly shown, and it matters not where the examination commence or where it terminate, still the same continuity of surface will be discernible throughout. If we trace it from side to side of the abdomen, we may commence at the umbilicus ; we then follow it outwards, lining the inner side of the parietes to the ascending colon; it surrounds that intestine; it then surrounds the small in- testine, and, returning on itself, forms the mesentery. It then invests the descending colon, and reaches the parietes on the oppo- site side of the abdomen, whence it may be traced to the exact point from which we started. The viscera, which are thus shown to be invested by the peri- toneum in its course from above downwards, are the Liver, Stomach, Transverse colon, Small intestines, Pelvic viscera.

Q Q 2PERITONEUM. 596 These, therefore, are the boundaries of the foramen of Winsloiv, which is nothing more than a constriction of the general cavity of the peritonenm at this point, arising out of the necessity for the hepatic and gastric arteries to pass forwards from the coeliac axis to reach their respective viscera. If air be blown through the foramen of Winslow, it will de- scend behind the lesser omentum and stomach to the space between the descending and ascending pair of layers, forming the great omentum. This is sometimes called the lesser cavity of the peri- toneum, and that external to the foramen the greater cavity ; in which case the foramen is considered as the means of communication between the two. There is a great objection to this division, as it might lead the inexperienced to believe that there were really two cavities. There is but one only, the foramen of Winslow being merely a constriction of that one, to facilitate the communication between the nutrient arteries and the viscera of the upper part of the abdomen. The Great omentum (gastro-colic) consists of four layers of peri- toneum, the two which descend from the stomach, and the same two, returning upon themselves to the transverse colon. A quantity of adipose substance is deposited around the vessels which ramify through its structure. It would appear to perform a double function in the economy :—1st. Protecting the intestines from cold ; and, 2ndly. Facilitating the movement of the intestines upon each other during their vermicular action. The Transverse meso-colon {jxectoq, middle, being attached to the middle of the cylinder of the intestine) is the medium of connexion between the transverse colon and the posterior wall of the abdomen. It affords to the nutrient arteries a passage to reach the intestine, and encloses between its layers, at the posterior part, the transverse portion of the duodenum. It also forms a transverse septum across the abdominal cavity. The Mesentery {iikaov tvrspov, being connected to the middle of the cylinder of the small intestine) is the medium of connexion between the small intestines and the posterior wall of the abdomen. It is oblique in its direction, being attached to the posterior wall, from the left side of the second lumbar vertebra to the right iliac fossa. It retains the small intestines in their places, and gives pas- sage to the mesenteric arteries, veins, nerves, and lymphatics. The Meso-rectum, in like manner, retains the rectum in con- nexion with the front of the sacrum. Besides this, there are some minor folds in the pelvis, as the recto-vesical fold, the false liga- ments of the bladder, and the broad ligaments of the uterus. The Appendices epiploicce are small irregular pouches of the peritoneum, filled with fat, and situated like fringes upon the large intestine. Three other duplicatures of the peritoneum are situated in the sides of the abdomen; they are the gastro-phrenic ligament, the597 ALIMENTARY CANAL. gastro-splenic omentum, the ascending and descending meso-colon. The gastro-phrenic ligament is a small duplicature of the peri- toneum, which descends from the diaphragm to the extremity of the oesophagus, and lesser curve of the stomach. The gastro-splenic omentum (ligamentum gastro-lienale) is the duplicature which con- nects the spleen to the stomach. The ascending meso-colon is the fold which connects the upper part of the ascending colon with the posterior wall of the abdomen; and the descending meso-colon, that which retains the sigmoid flexure in connexion with the abdominal wall. Structure of Serous Membrane.—Serous membrane consists of two layers, an external or cellulo-fibrous layer, and an internal layer or epithelium. The cellulo-fibrous layer upon its outer sur- face is rough and vascular, and adherent to surrounding structures; but on its inner or free surface is dense and smooth, and deficient of vessels. The smooth and brilliant surface of serous membrane is due to an epithelium, composed of laminss of cells and flattened polyhedral scales with central nuclei, like the epiderma and epithe- lium of mucous membrane. Henle has observed this structure on the surface of all the serous membranes of the body, upon the sur- face of the lining membrane of arteries and veins, and on synovial meinbranes. The general characters of a serous membrane are its resemblance to a shut sac, and its secretion of a peculiar fluid, resembling the serum of the blood; but the former of these characters is not abso- lutely essential to the identity of a serous membrane; for, as we have shown above, the peritoneum in the female is perforated by the extremities of the Fallopian tubes; while in some aquatic rep- tiles there is a direct communication between its cavity and the medium in which they live. From the variable nature of the secretion of these membranes, they have been divided into two classes, the true serous membranes, viz., the arachnoid, pericardium, pleurae, peritoneum, and tunicse vaginales, which pour out a secretion containing but a small portion of albumen ; and the synovial membranes and bursse, which secrete a fluid containing a larger quantity of albumen. The Alimentary canal is a musculo-membranous tube, extending from the mouth to the anu.s. It is variously named in the diff'erent parts of its course; hence it is divided into, the ALIMENTARY CANAL. Mouth, Pharynx, (Esophagus, Stomach, !Duodenum, Jejunum, Ileum. Large intestine < Colon, f Rectum.598 MOUTH.—HAED PALATE. The Mouth (cavum, sen, cavitas oris) is the irregular cavity which contains the organs of taste and the principal instrnments of mastication. It is bounded, in front, by the lips and fissura oris; on either side, by the internal surface of the cheeks; above, by the hard palate and teeth of the upper jaw; below, by the tongue, by the mucous membrane stretched between the arch of the lower jaw and the under surface of the tongue, and by the teeth of the inferior maxilla; and behind, by the soft palate and fauces. The space be- tween the teeth and fleshy walls of the face is termed vestihulum oris. The Z«j9s (labium superius et inferius) are two fleshy folds formed externally by common integument and internally by mucous mem- brane, and containing between these two layers, muscles, a quantity of fat, and numerous small labial glands. They are attached to the surface of the upper and lower jaw, and each lip is connected to the gum in the middle line by a fold of mucous membrane, the frcemim labii superioris and frwnum labii inferioris, the latter being very small. The Cheeks (buccsB) are continuous with the lips, and form the sides of the face; they are composed of integument, a large quantity of fat, muscles, mucous membrane, and buccal glands. The mucous membrane lining the cheeks is reflected above and below upon the sides of the jaws, and is attached posteriorly to the anterior margin of the ramus of the lower jaw. At about its middle, opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw, is a papilla, upon which may be observed a small opening, the aperture of the duct of the parotid gland. The Hard palate (palatum durum, sen, osteum) is a dense struc- ture, composed of mucous membrane, palatine glands, fibrous tissue, vessels, and nerves, and firmly connected to the palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate bones. It is bounded in front and on each side by the alveolar processes and gums, and is con- tinuous behind with the soft palate. Along the middle line it is marked by an elevated raphe, and presents upon each side of the raphe a number of transverse ridges and grooves. Near its anterior extremity, and immediately behind the middle incisor teeth, is a papilla which corresponds with the termination of the anterior pala- tine canal, and receives the naso-palatine nerves. The Gums (gingivae) are composed of a thick and dense mucous membrane, which is closely adherent to the periosteum of the alveolar processes, and embraces the necks of the teeth. They are remark- able for their hardness and insensibility; and for their close contact, without adhesion, to the surface of the tooth. From the neck of the tooth they are reflected into the alveolus, and become continuous with the periosteal (peridental) membrane of that cavity. The Tongue has been already described as an organ of sense; it is invested by mucous membrane, which is reflected from its under part upon the inner surface of the lower jaw, and constitutes, with599 SOFT PALATE.—TONSILS. the muscles beneath, the floor of the mouth. On the under surface of the tongue, near its anterior part, the mucous membrane forms a considerable fold, which is called the frsenum lingu£e; and on each side of the frsenum is a large papUla (caruncula sublingualis), the termination of the duct (Wharton's duct) of the submaxillary gland. Running back from this papilla is a ridge, occasioned by the promi- nence of the sublingual gland; and opening upon the summit of this ridge, a number of small openings, the apertures of the excre- tory ducts of the gland. Posteriorly the tongue is connected with the OS hyoides by muscle, and to the epiglottis by three folds of mucous membrane, called the frcena epiglottidis. The Soft palate (palatum moUe; velum pendulum palati) is a fold of mucous membrane situated at the posterior part of the mouth. It is continuous, superiorly, with the hard palate, and is composed of mucous membrane, palatine glands, and muscles. Hanging from the middle of its inferior border is a small rounded process, the uvula; and passing outwards from the uvula on each side are two curved folds of the mucous membrane, the arches or pillars of the palate. The anterior pillar (arcus palatinus inferior; glosso-palatinus) is continued downwards to the side of the base of thje tongue, and is formed by the prominence of the palato-glossus muscle. The posterior pillar (arcus palatinus superior; pharyngo- palatinus) is prolonged downwards and backwards into the pharynx, and is formed by the convexity of the palato-pharyngeus muscle. These two pillars, closely united above, are separated below by a triangular interval or niche, in which the tonsU is lodged. The Tonsils (amygdalae) are two glandular organs, about half an inch in length, shaped like almonds, and situated between the an- terior and posterior pillar of the soft palate, on each side of the fauces. They are composed of an assemblage of mucous follicles, which open on the surface of the gland by twelve or fifteen aper- tures. Externally, they are invested by the pharyngeal fascia, which separates them from the superior constrictor muscle and in- ternal carotid artery, and prevents an abscess from opening in that direction. In relation to surrounding parts, each gland corresponds with the angle of the lower jaw. The Mucous glands of the mouth (orales) are the lahial, situated beneath mucous membrane of the lips; buccal, beneath the mem- brane of the cheeks; molar, between the masseter and buccinator muscle, and piercing the latter by their ducts opposite the molar teeth; palatine, situated in the hard and soft palate; and lingual, on the dorsum of the tongue at its root. The space included between the soft palate and the root of the tongue is the isthmus of the fauces. It is bounded above by the soft palate; on each side by the pillars of the soft palate and tonsils; and below by the root of the tongue. It is the opening between the mouth and pharynx.600 SALIVAKY GLANDS. Communicating witli the moutli are the excretory ducts of three pairs of salivary glands (glandules salivales), the parotid, submaxil- lary, and sublingual. The Parotid gland, (Trapd, near, ovq, wrog, the ear,) the largest of the three, is situated immediately in front of the external ear, and extends superficially for a short distance over the masseter muscle, and deeply behind the ramus of the lower jaw. It reaches inferiorly to below the level of the angle of the jaw, and posteriorly to the mastoid process, slightly overlapping the insertion of the sterno-mastoid muscle. Embedded in its substance are, the external carotid artery, temporal vein, and facial nerve; emerging from its anterior border, the transverse facial artery and branches of the facial nerve; and above, the temporal artery and auriculo-temporal nerve. The duct of the parotid gland (Stenon's* duct), about two inches in length, and about the diameter of a crow's-quill, issues from the anterior part of the gland, just below the zygoma, and crosses the masseter muscle; it then curves inwards over the anterior border of the muscle, and pierces the buccinator opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw; its opening in the mouth being indicated by a prominent papilla. The duct is dense in structure, and its walls of considerable thick- ness in proportion to the area of the tube, which is remarkably small. A small glandular appendage, the socia parotidis, is con- nected with the upper part of the duct on the masseter muscle; and opens into it by one or several small ducts. The Submaxillary gland, rounded in its form, is situated in the posterior part of the submaxillary triangle of the neck. It rests on the hyo-glossus, stylo-glossus, and mylo-hyoideus muscle, and is covered in by the body of the lower jaw and the deep cervical fascia. It is separated from the parotid gland by the stylo-maxillary liga- ment, and from the sublingual by the mylo-hyoideus muscle. Em- bedded among its lobules are the facial artery and submaxillary ganglion. Its excretory duct (Wharton^s), about two inches in length, issues from the middle of the gland, and passes between the mylo-hyoideus and hyo-glossus to the frsenum linguae, by the side of which it termi- nates at the apex of a papilla (caruncula sublingualis). A process of the gland is prolonged with the duct for a short distance behind the mylo-hyoideus. The Sublingual is a long and flattened gland, situated beneath * Nicholas Stenon, an anatomist of great research. He discovered the parotid duct while in Paris, He was appointed Professor of Medicine in Copenhagen in 1672. His work, " DeMusculis et GlanduHs Observationes," was published in 1664.601 PHARYNX, the mucous membrane of tlie floor of the mouth, on each side of the frsenum linguse. It is in relation at the frsenum with its fellow of the opposite side, and in the rest of its course lies between the lower jaw and genio-hyo-glossus, being bounded below by the mylo-hyoi- deus. It is in relation also with the duct of the submaxillary gland and the hypoglossal nerve. Its secretion is poured into the mouth by from seven to twenty short ducts {ductus Riviniani), which open upon the ridge made by the gland in the floor of the mouth ; the larger openings being situ- ated by the side of the fragnum lingua. One of the ducts longer than the rest, and opening close to Wharton's duct, has been named ductus Bartholini. Structure.—The salivary are conglomerate glands, consisting of lobes, which are made up of polyhedral lobules, and these of smaller lobules. The smallest lobule is apparently composed of granules (acini), which are minute caecal pouches, formed by the dilatation of the ex- treme ramifications of the ducts. These minute ducts unite to form lobular ducts, and the lobular ducts constitute by their union a single excretory duct. The csecal pouches are connected by cellular tissXie, so as to form a minute lobule; the lobules and larger lobes are held together by a more condensed, but lax cellular layer. The submaxillary and sublingual glands are looser in structure and their lobules are larger than those of the parotid gland. Vessels and Nerves.—The parotid gland is abundantly supplied with arteries by the external carotid; the submaxillary by the facial and lingual; and the sublingual by the sublingual and sub- mental branches of the lingual artery. The Nerves of the parotid gland are derived from the auriculo- temporal branch of the inferior maxillary, from the auricularis magnus, and from the nervi molles accompanying the external caro- tid artery. The submaxillary gland is supplied by the branches of the submaxillary ganglion, sympathetic, and by filaments from the mylo-hyoidean nerve ; and the sublingual by filaments from the submaxillary ganglion and gustatory nerve. PHARYNX. The pharynx {(pdpvy^, the throat) is a musculo-membranous sac, about four inches in length, situated upon the cervical portion of the vertebral column, and extending from the base of the skull to a point corresponding with the cricoid cartilage in front, and the fifth cervical vertebra behind. It is composed of mucous mem- brane, muscles, and a strong aponeurosis; and communicates in front with the cavity of the nose, mouth, and larynx. Above it is attached partly by muscle, but chiefly by aponeurosis, to the basOar process of the occipital bone and petrous portion of the temporal, and below it is continuous with the oesophagus.PHARYNX. —(ESOPHAGUS. 602 Upon its anterior part it has opening into it seven foramina, viz.— Posterior nares, two, _ j Eustachian tubes, two, Mouth, Larynx, (Esophagus. The Posterior nares (choanse narium) are the two large open- ings at the upper and front part of the pharynx. On each side of these openings, and parallel with the posterior termination of the inferior turbinated bone, is the slit-like opening in the mucous membrane, marking the entrance of the Eustachian tube. Beneath the posterior nares is the isthmus faucium, the large opening into the mouth, partly veiled by the soft palate; and, beneath the root of the tongue, the cordiform opening of the larynx (aditus ad glossidem). The esophageal open- ing is the lower constricted portion of the pharynx. (Esophagus.—The oesophagus (oittv, to bear, (pdynv, to eat) is a slightly flexuous canal, inclining to the left in the neck, to the right in the upper part of the thorax,'!' and again to the left in its course through the posterior mediastinum ; it commences at the termina- tion of the pharynx, opposite the lower border of the cricoid carti- lage and fifth cervical vertebra, and descends the neck behind, and rather to the left of the trachea. It then passes behind the arch of the aorta and left bronchus, and along the posterior mediastinum, lying in front of the thoracic aorta, to the oesophageal opening in the diaphragm, where it enters the abdomen, and terminates at the cardiac orifice of the stomach opposite the ninth or tenth dorsal vertebra.

THE STOMACH. The stomach is an expansion of the alimentary canal, situated in the left hypochondriac and epigastric region, and, for a small ex- tent, in the right hypochondriac region. It is directed somewhat obliquely from above downwards, from left to right, and from be- hind forwards ; and in the female, from tight-lacing, is longer than in the male. On account of the peculiarity of its form, it is divided into a greater or splenic, and ,a lesser or pyloric end; a lesser cur- vature above, and a greater curvature below ; an anterior and a posterior surface; a cardiac orifice, and a pyloric orifice. The great end (fundus) is not only of large size, but expands beyond the point of entrance of the oesophagus, and is embraced by the con- cave surface of the spleen; it presents superiorly a funnel shaped expansion, leading to the cardiac orifice. The pylorus (janitor) is the small and contracted extremity of the organ; it is situated on a plane anterior and inferior to the cardiac orifice, and lies in contact wilih the under surface of the liver, often reaching to the gall- bladder. Near the lesser end is a dilatation, the antrum of the pylorus. The two curvatures give attachment to the peritoneum ; the upper curve to the lesser omentum, the lower to the great omentum. The anterior surface looks upward and forward, and is in relation with the diaphragm, (which separates it from the viscera of the thorax and six lower ribs,) with the left lobe of the liver, and in the epigastric region with the abdominal parietes. The posterior surface looks downwards and backwards, and is in relation with the diaphragm, pancreas, third portion of the duodenum, transverse mesocolon, left kidney, and left supra-renal capsule; this surface forms the anterior boundary of that cul-de-sac of the peritoneum which is situated behind the lesser omentum and extends into the greater omentum. In a state of distention, as after a meal, the an- terior surface becomes superior, and the greater curvature is directed forwards against the abdominal parietes. Meckel estimates the ca- pacity of the stomach at one foot square; when moderately full it is capable of holding from five to ten pints of fluid. SMALL INTESTINES. The small intestine {intestinum tenue) is about twenty or twenty- five feet in length, and is divisible into three portions, duodermm, jejunum, and ileum. Th.Q Duodenum, (called SiodtKadaKrvXav by Herophilus,) larger and more deeply seated than the rest of the small intestine, has re- ceived its name from being about equal in length to the breadth of604 SMALL INTESTINES. twelve fingers (eiglit or ten inches). In its course it presents a horse-shoe curve; commencing at the pylorus, it ascends obliquely backwards to the under surface of the liver; it next descends per- pendicularly in front of the right kidney as low as the fourth lum- bar vertebra, and then passes nearly transversely across the third lumbar vertebra; terminating in the jejunum on the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, where it is crossed by the superior mesen- teric artery and vein. It is connected with the portal eminence of the liver by means of a band of peritoneum called ligamentum hepatico-duodenale: and to the right kidney by another band, the ligamentum duodeno-renale. The first or oblique portion (pars transversa superior) of its course, between two and three inches in length, is completely enclosed by Fig. 204.* * Vertical and longitudinal section of the stomach and duodenum, made in such, a direction as to include the two orifices of the stomach. 1.

The second or perpendicular portion (pars de- scendens) is situated altogether behind the peritoneum : it is in rela- tion by its anterior surface with the commencement of the arch of the colon; by its posterior surface with the concave margin of the right kidney, the inferior vena cava, and ductus communis chole- dochus ; by its right border with the ascending colon : and by its left border with the pancreas. The ductus communis choledochus and pancreatic duct open into the internal and posterior side of the perpendicular portion, a little below its middle. The third or transverse portion (pars transversa inferior) of the duodenum, the longest and narrowest of the three, lies between the diverging layers of the transverse mesocolon, with which and with the stomach it is in relation in front; above, it is in contact with the lower border of the pancreas, the superior mesenteric artery and vein being inter- posed ; and, behind, it rests upon the inferior vena cava and aorta. The Jejunum (jejunus, empty) is named from being generally found empty. It forms the upper two-fifths of the small intestine : commencing at the duodenum {flexura duodeno-jejunalis) on the left s\de of the second lumber vertebra, and terminating in the ileum. It is thicker to the touch than the rest of the intestine, has a pink- ish tinge from containing more mucous membrane than the ileum, and is situated in the umbilical region and left iliac fossa. • The Ileum (eiXeiv, to twist, to convolute) includes the remain- ing three-fifths of the small intestine. It is somewhat smaller in calibre, thinner in texture, and paler than the jejunum ; but there is no mark by which to distinguish the termination of the one or the commencement of the other. It is situated in the umbilical and hypogastric region and pelvic cavity, and terminates in the right iliac fossa, by opening at an obtuse angle into the colon. The small intestines form in their course a double curve resem- bling the letter S, the upper curve to the right representing that of the duodenum ; and the lower to the left that of the jejunum and ileum to the termination of the latter in the caecum. The jejunum and ileum are surrounded, above and at the sides, by the colon; in front they are in relation with the omentum and abdominal parietes; they are retained in their position by the me- sentery, which connects them with the posterior wall of the abdo- men ; and below they descend into the cavity of the pelvis. At about the lower third of the ileum a pouch-like process or diverti- culum of the intestine is occasionally seen. This is a vestige of em- bryonic structure, and is formed by the obliteration of the omphalo- mesenteric or vitelline duct at a short distance from the cylinder of the intestine.606 LARGE INTESTINE. The large intestine (intestinum crassum vel amplum) five or six feet and sometimes more in length, prismoid in form, sacculated and thicker than the small intestine, tapers gradually from above down- wards, and is divided into the ccecum, colon, and rectum. The Ccecum (caput coli) is the blind pouch, or cul-de-sac, about two inches in length, situated at the commencement of the large intes- tine. It is lodged in the right iliac fossa, and retained in its place by the peritoneum which passes over its anterior surface; its constitute a meso-c^cum, which permits of an usual degree of move- ment in this portion of the intestine, and serves to explain the occur- rence of hernia of the csscum upon the right side. The caecum is the most dilated portion of the large intestine. The Colon is divided into ascending, transverse, and descending. The ascending colon passes upwards from the right iliac fossa, through the right lumbar region, to the under surface of the liver. It then bends inwards (flexura dextravel hepatica) and crosses the upper part * The caecum, showing its appendix, the entrance of the Ueum, and the ileo-CBecal valve. 1. The cseeum. 2.

It is usually in ore or less coiled upon itself, md retained in that coil by a fal- iiform duplicature of peritoneum. I ts canal is extremely small, and ihe orifice by which it opens into the caecum not unfrequently pro- vided with an incomplete v^alve. Occasionally the peritoneum in- vests the caecum so completely as toCOLON,—RECTUM. 607 of the umbilical region under tlie name of transverse colon ; and, on the left side [flexura sinistra vel lienalis), descends, descending colon, through the left lumbar region to the left iliac fossa, where it makes a remarkable curve upon itself, which is called the sigmoid flexure (flexura iliaca). The ascending colon, the most dilated portion of the large intes- tine, next to the caecum, is retained in position in the abdomen either by the peritoneum passing simply in front of it or by a narrow meso-colon. It is in relation in front with the small intestine and abdominal parietes; behind with the quadratus lumborum muscle and right kidney; internally with the small intestine and per- pendicular portion of the duodenum ; and by its upper extremity with the under surface of the liver and gall-bladder. The transverse colon, the longest portion of the large intestine, forms a curve across the cavity of the abdomen, the convexity of which looks forwards and sometimes downwards. It is in relation, by its upper surface, with the liver, gall-bladder, stomach, and lower extremity of the spleen; by its lower surface, with the small intestine; by its anterior surface, with the anterior layers of the great omentum and abdominal parietes; and, by its posterior sur- face, with the transverse meso-colon. The descending colon is smaller in calibre, and situated more deeply than the ascending colon. Its relations are precisely similar. The sigmoid flexure is the narrowest part of the colon; it curves in the first place upwards and to the right, then downwards and to the left, and is retained in its place by a meso-colon. It is in rela- tion, in front, with the small intestine and abdominal parietes; and behind, with the iliac fossa. The Rectum, the termination of the large intestine, is seven or eight inches in length. It has received its name, not so much from the direction of its course, as from the straightness of its form in comparison with the colon. It descends, from opposite the left sacro-iliac symphysis, in front of the sacrum, forming a gentle curve to the right side, and then returning to the middle line ; opposite the extremity of the coccyx it curves backwards to terminate at the anus at about an inch in front of the apex of that bone. The rectum, therefore, forms a double flexure in its course, the one being directed from side to side, the other from before backwards. It is smaller in calibre at its upper part than the sigmoid flexure, but becomes gra- dually larger as it descends, and its lower extremity, previously to its termination at the anus, forms a dilatation of considerable but variable magnitude. With reference to its relations, the rectum is divided into three portions; the first, including half its length, extends to about the middle of the sacrum, is completely surrounded by peritoneum, and connected to the sacrum by means of the meso-rectum. It is in re- lation, above, with the left sacro-iliac symphysis ; and, below, with the branches of the internal iliac artery, sacral plexus of nerves andMUCOUS MEMBRANE. 608 left ureter ; one or two convolutions of the small intestine are inter- posed between the front of the rectum and the bladder, in the male; and between the rectum and the uterus with its appendages, in the female. The second portion, about three inches in length, is closely attached to the surface of the sacrum, and covered by peritoneum only in front; it is in relation by its lower part with the base of the bladder, vesiculse seminales, and prostate gland; and in the female with the vagina. The third portion curves backwards from opposite the prostate gland and tip of the coccyx to terminate at the anus ; it is embraced by the levatores ani, and is about one inch and a half in length. It is separated from the membranous portion of the urethra by a triangular space; in the female this space intervenes between the vagina and the rectum, and constitutes by its base the perineum. The Anus is situated at a little more than an inch in front of the extremity of the coccyx. The integument around it is covered with hairs, and is thrown into numerous radiated plaits which are obli- terated during the passage of faeces. The margin of the anus is provided with an abundance of sebiparous glands, and the epiderma may be seen terminating by a fringed and scalloped border, at a few lines above the extremity of the opening. STRUCTURE 0¥ THE INTESTINAL CANAL. The pharynx has three coats; a mucous coat, a fibrous coat, de- rived from the pharyngeal fascia, and a muscular layer. The oesophagus has three coats, the mucous, cellular, and muscular. The stomach and intestines have four, mticous, cellular, muscular, and an external serous investment, derived from the peritoneum. Mucous Coat.—The mucous membrane of the mouth invests the whole internal surface of that cavity, and is reflected along the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual ducts, into the corresponding glands. It terminates anteriorly upon the outer margin of the red border of the lips, and posteriorly is continuous with the mucous lining of the pharynx. The mucous membrane of the pharynx, paler than that of the mouth, is continuous with the mucous lining of the Eustachian tubes, nares, mouth, and larynx. In the oesophagus the mucous membrane is thinner and more dense than that of the pharynx, pale red above and whitish below. It is provided with a few scattered papillse, is firmly connected with the cellular coat, and disposed in longitudinal plicce. In the stomach the mucous membrane is thin at the great extre- mity, and thicker towards the pyloric extremity. It is of a pinkish colour, the depth of colour being greater in infancy than in the adult, and less in old age ; and increased under the excitement of digestion. It is, moreover, formed into plaits or rugce, which are disposed for the most part in a longitudinal direction. The rugae are most numerous towards the lesser end of the stomach; while609 ILEO-C^CAL VALVE. around the cardiac orifice they assume a radiated arrangement. At the pylorus the mucous membrane forms a circular or spiral fold which constitutes a part of the apparatus of the pyloric valve. In the lower three-fourths of the duodenum the mucous mem- brane forms circular or crescentic folds, the valvulce conniventes, which are also found in the jejunum and upper portion of the ileum. On the posterior and inner wall of the descending portion of the duodenum is a vertical projection of the mucous membrane about an inch in length, plica longitudinalis, caused by the prominence of the ductus communis choledochus, and at the inferior extremity of the plica longitudinalis is the aperture of that duct and of the pan- creatic duct. The valvulae conniventes are several lines in breadth in the lower part of the duodenum and upper portion of the jejunum, and diminish gradually in size towards each extremity. In the ileum they are consequently narrow, and cease entirely at about its middle. They do not entirely surround the cylinder of the intes- tine, but extend for about one-half or three-fourths of its circum- ference. In the lower half of the ileum the mucous lining, being without folds, the coats of the intestine are very thin as compared with the jejunum and duodenum. At the termination of the ileum in the ccecum the mucous mem- brane forms two folds, which are strengthened by the muscular coat, and project into the csecum. These are the ileo-ccecal valve (valvula Bauhini). In the c^cum and colon the mucous membrane is raised into crescentic folds (plicae sigmoidese), which correspond with the sharp edges of the sacculi; and, in the rectum, it forms three val- vular folds,* one of which is situated near the commencement of the intestine; the second, extending from the side of the tube, is placed opposite the middle of the sacrum ; and the third, which is the largest and most constant, projects from the anterior wall of the intestine opposite the base of the bladder. Besides these folds, the membrane in the empty state of the intestine is thrown into longi- tudinal plaits, somewhat similar to those of the oesophagus ; these have been named the columns of the rectum. The mucous mem- brane of the rectum is connected to the muscular coat by a very loose cellular tissue, as in the oesophagus. Structure of Mucous Membrane.—Mucous membrane is ana- logous to the cutaneous covering of the exterior of the body, and resembles that tissue very closely in its structure. It is composed of two layers, epithelium and corium. Epithelium is analogous to the epiderma in forming a layer of protection to the structure which it invests ; it constitutes the sur- face of the mucous membrane, and indeed of all the other internal membranes of the body, namely, the serous and synovial membranes, the heart, the blood vessels, and lymphatics. Like the epiderma * Mr. Houston, "On the Mucous Membrane of the Eectum." Dublin Hospital Eeports, vol. v. R RSTRUCTURE OF MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 610 also it is composed of minute cells, generated on tlie surface of the corium in a soft, transparent, jelly-like substance, filled with small granules, the blastema, which serves besides the purpose of con- necting the cells together. The blastema, originally fluid, soon be- comes filled Math organic granules ; these granules congregating to- gether in small masses constitute the nucleus, or original part of the cell, the separate granules being the nucleoli. Around the nucleus other granules accumulate and grow, a boundary membrane is formed about them, and the cell is complete, consisting of its nucleus with included nucleoli, the cavity of the cell, which is composed of gra- nules and secondary cells, and the cell-membrane. This process of cell-formation being in constant operation on all the surfaces of the body, the old cells of the surface of the epithelium are regularly cast ofi", while young cells take their place from below. A section of epithelium would, therefore, like the epiderma, show cells in successive stages of formation and growth, namely, as simple gra- nules, aggregated granules or nuclei, small cells, and larger and complete cells. The cells of epithelium present some differences of form and arrangement which have given rise to their division into four varie- ties, namely, squamous, columnar, spheroidal, and ciliated. The Squamous epithelium is so named from the conversion of its superficial cells into thin, flattened, polyhedral squamae or scales, in which the original structure of the cell, together with its nucleus, is more or less effaced. On the serous membranes of the cavities of the body and on that of the blood and lymph vessels, the squamge form a single layer, but on the mucous membrane, as on the skin, there are several superimposed layers ; hence the names lamellated, tesselated, stratified, Andpavement epithelium, have been given to this variety. The squamous epithelium is found on the conjunctiva ; in the cavity of the nose near its external apertures; in the mouth and fauces; in the oesophagus, where it forms a thick layer, and terminates at the cardiac orifice of the stomach by a serrated border, ora serrata ; in the vulva, vagina, cervix uteri, and en- trance of the urethra. The squam83 are somewhat larger in the mouth and fauces than elsewhere; in longest dia- meter they measure between 4^ and -3-^ of an inch; in the * Epithelial scales from the movith; the large scale, magnified 310 times, exhibits the structure of the scale, as consisting of a nucleus vnth. nucleolus in the centre, and secondary nucleated cells, forming the body of the scale.

The Columnar epithelium consists of cells, which have an elon- gated or pyriform shape, their bases being directed to the free sur- face, and their apices to the corium. They are arranged side by side like columns, and their interstices are filled with a transparent jelly-like substance, similar to that which connects the cells of the squamous epithelium. Each column contains near its middle a nucleus, which gives it a swollen appearance, and the nucleus possesses one or more nucleoli; from the transparence of the column the nucleus may be seen through its base. The columnar epithe- lium occurs in the stom- ach and bowels, urethra, gall-bladder, and ducts of glands. In the gall- bladder the nucleus is less apparent than in other parts. The Spheroidal epithelium is composed of cells, which are sphe- roidal in shape, and more or less polyhedral from compression; in other respects they resemble in structure the cells of the preceding varieties. They are found in situations where the squamous and columnar epithelium are continuous, and on that account have been named by Henle transitional epithe- lium. The spheroidal epithelium also occurs in the excretory passages of the kidney, the bladder, and in the excretory ducts of the glands which open upon the mucous membrane and skin. The Ciliated epithelium is characterised by the presence of minute conical vibratile filaments {cilia) mounted on the broad ends of the colum- nar cells, or upon the free surface of those of the spheroidal kind. The cilia are in constant action, and produce a wave-like motion, which carries the secretions in contact with them towards the outlet of the organ in which they exist. They are found in the nose and sinuses communicating with the nose; in the nasal duct; upper part of the pharynx and Eustachian tubes; larynx, trachea, * Columnar epithelium from the small intestine: after Henle. a.

The epithelium of the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal is, therefore, squamous in the mouth, guttural part of the pharynx and oesophagus; and columnar in the stomach, intestines, and mucous glands. In the upper or nasal portion of the pharynx the epithelium is columnar and ciliated, as belonging to the apparatus of the air passages. In the mouth the epithelium is thin and con- tinuous at the outer edge of the lips with the epiderma; in the cesophagus it is thick, and terminates by an abrupt and serrated border {ora serrata) at the cardiac orifice of the stomach; below this point the epithelium is thin and transparent. The CoRiUM is analogous to the corium of the skin, and is that part of the mucous membrane upon which its thickness depends. In structure it consists of two portions; of a thin transparent surface layer, the limitary membrane (membrana propria; basement mem- brane of Bowman), and a fibre-vascular portion, which constitutes the chief bulk of the corium. It is rich in blood vessels, and its fibrous element varies in quan- Fig. 210.t tity in different membranes, and also in difi'erent parts of the same membrane; thus, it is thick in the oesophagus, thin in the stomach and intestines, and thickest in the bladder and vagina. In the limitary membrane and in that part of the corium immediately beneath it, there is no fibrous tissue, the structure * Cells of the columnar ciliated epithelium of the nose, magnified 310 times.

The trifid or quadrifid division of a small artery is seen at the bottom of each alveolus, and in the depressions between the divisions of the artery, the apertures of the gastric follicles; two, three, or four, in each depression.613 ALVEOLAR MUCOUS MEMBRANE, hi ft of the latter being a transparent substance containing granules and minute cells. It is this substance, together with the limitary mem- brane, which constitutes the papillae and villi of mucous membrane. In the alimentary canal, the surface of the membrane presents some diversity of appearance, having reference to the mode of arrangement of the limitary membrane. Thus in the stomach it is raised into a delicate network, the minute openings included within the frame of the network being termed alveoli, and this form of mu- Fig. 211.* cous membrane alveolar. The alveolar mucous mem- ^'I'^Wjl^'-)^^^ brane is also found in the large intestine, where the alveoli are smaller and the septa thicker than those of the stomach; in the vesi- cul^ seminales, where they are larger ; and in the gall- bladder, where they are very large and coarse. The alveoli of the stomach are polyhe- dral, for the most part hexagonal in form, and have opening into their floor the mouths of the gastric follicles ; in the pyloric end of the stomach, they are oblong 2i f in form, and their walls are rendered uneven by the pre- sence of numerous flattened papillae or villi.

The villi vary in form, some being conical; others of the membrane, both on the valvulse conniventes and between those folds, and when immersed in water they give it the appear- ance of a fine velvet. There are no villi in the large intestine. The rete of the stomach and large intestine and the villi of the small intestine are both highly vascular; and, besides the limitary membrane and granular sublimitary substance, have entering into their structure capillary and lymphatic vessels. The villi have each a small artery and vein, with an intermediate capillary plexus; but no nerves have as yet been traced into them. The lymphatic or lacteal of each villus probably commences, as Henle has described, as a single csecal vessel. Krause thinks it begins both as a plexus and by several csecal tubes. Cellular coat.—The Cellular coat (submucous, vascular, ner- vous) is a moderately thick stratum of fibro-cellular tissue, which serves as the bond of connexion between the mucous and muscular coat. It gives support to the mucous membrane, and affords a nidus to the vessels and nerves previously to their distribution to that structure. It is firmly adherent to the mucous layer, but more loosely to the muscular coat. The cellular coat is thin and dense in the oesophagus ; thicker and more distinct in the stomach; and thicker than the other coats in the small intestine, where it is loose in texture, devoid of fat, and easily distended with air, excepting at * A portion of the mucous membrane of the jejunum, lying between the valvulae conniventes, magnified 19 times, and showing the lamellated and convoluted form of villi; the breadth of the lamellae is '^^ inch.

They measure in length about of an inch, and in thickness taper from to or of an inch, and are so numer- ous that Krause counted from fifty to ninety within the limits of a square line in the upper part of the in- testine; and lower down from forty to seventy; the entire number of villi in the small intestine he esti- mated at four millions. The villi are situated upon every part of the surface615 CELLULAR COAT—GLANDS. Peyer's glands, where it is closely adherent. It is also thicker in the upper part of the small intestine than below, and is one cause of the greater thickness of the duodenum and jejunum ; moreover, it enters into the structure of the valvulae conniventes. Glands.—In the corium and in the loose cellular tissue con- necting the mucous with the cellular coat, are situated the glands of the mucous membrane. These glands present some variety of struc- ture, and admit of division into three groups, tubular, saccular, and cornpound. The tubular glands or follicles are minute csecal tubes, placed perpendicularly in the corium, and distributed in great numbers through the mucous membrane. They are composed of limitary membrane, surrounded externally by a plexus of capillary vessels, and lined within by a columnar epithelium; their contents are a transparent granular pulp. In the intestine these follicles are small (about of a line in length, by in breadth), and have re- ceived the name of simple follicles, those of the small intestine being the crypts of Lieberhillin. In the stomach they are long and sacculated at the extremity, and have received the name of gastric follicles (glandule pepsiniferse). They are more simple in structure at the cardiac than at the pyloric end of the stomach, and are so closely packed together, as to seem in a vertical section to be the chief component of the mucous membrane. The saccular glands (vesicular) are described as being small lentil-shaped (lenticular) sacs, situated in the substance of the corium, and apparently devoid of excretory opening. Their walls are thick and fragile, and their contents a transparent or whitish and opake granular pulp. Their function is not well known, but they are supposed to burst from time to time, and give exit to their secretion. The saccular glands, under the name of lenticular, are found in small numbers in the stomach, especially at its pyloric end. In the small intestine they are said to constitute the glandulse solitarise and agminatse. The glandulce solitaries (Fig. 212, a) are dispersed numerously over the mucous membrane, and may be recognised by their whitish and slightly raised surface, and by their oval form encircled by a ring of simple follicles. In the lower part of the jejunum and upper part of the ileum, several of these solitary glands are collected toge- ther so as to form patches of small size. The glandulce agminatce (aggregates; Peyer's glands) are oval and oblong patches of lighter colour than the surrounding mucous membrane, and situated in the ileum and lower part of the jejunum, but principally at the lower part of the former, where they are larger than above. They are found in that portion of the intestine which is opposite the attachment of the mesentery, and vary in size from half an inch to several inches in length, and from a quarter to half an inch in breadth. To the naked eye they have the ap-616 GLANDS OP THE INTESTINE. pearance of pale disks pierced with mimerous small irregular fissures; but, under the microscope, they are found to be composed of a reti- cular and alveolar structure. The reticular structure, forming the septa between the alveoli, measures between and ^ of an inch in breadth; it is highly vas- Mg. 214.* . cular, and presents on its surface the numerous small angular and oval openings of shallow pits. The al- veoli are quadrangular and oblong in form, and measure in longest diameter about of an inch. Their floor is somewhat raised in the centre by a vascular net- work, and in the foveolse formed by the radiating branches of this vascular network are the openings of numerous simple follicles. The alveoli are considerably less vascular than the re- ticular structure; but I have been unable to discover anything to warrant the idea of a sacculus, such as that which is supposed to constitute a saccular gland. The cellular coat of the intestine is closely adherent to the mu- Fig. 215.t cous membrane in the situ- ation of these glandular patches, and more richly supplied with vessels than elsewhere. The solitary glands of the large intestine are small round whitish bodies of about * A portion of one of Peyer's glands, magnified 19 times.

Examined by the naked eye, each glandular prominence has the appearance of a small circular opening, bordered by an elevated rim. With the mi- croscope" the elevated rim and sloping sides of the opening are seen to be composed of a reticular framework and alveoli similar to the rest of the mucous membrane of the large intestine, excepting that the alveoli are more angular and deeper and the septa thinner. The same alveolar structure is continued to the bottom of the cavity of the gland, where there is the appearance of the apertures of simple follicles. The Compound glands are small lobulated conglomerate masses, provided with ramified ducts, which open on the surface of the mucous membrane by means of an excretory duct. They are found in the submucous cellular tissue of the pharynx, where they are termed "pharyngeal glands; in the cellular coat of the oesophagus, particularly at its lower part, oesophageal glands; and in the cellu- lar coat of the duodenum, duodenal, or Brmmer's glands. Two of the pharyngeal glands are found near the aperture of the Eusta- chian tube. ; The duodenal or Brunner's glands are very numerous, and were compared by Von Brunn to a second pancreas; in structure they resemble the small glands found beneath the mucous membrane of the lips and mouth. , Besides the above, which are the compound glands of the alimentary canal, there are others more simple in structure and more superfi- cial in position, which have hitherto escaped observation, and have re- mained undescribed. These glands resemble in structure the sebipa- rous glands of the skin, and are, I believe, the true muciparous glands. The Muciparous glands are found both in the small and large intestine. In the large intestine (fig, 211) they occupy the alveoli, and constitute the floor of those cavities. They are white, semi- transparent, obscurely lobulated, and provided with an excretory aperture. Commonly, each alveolus has its separate gland ; but oc- casionally, and especially where the alveolus is longer than usual, there may be two glands and two excretory apertures. The gland fills the alveolus, rising almost to the level of its brim, and thereby rendering the cavity of the alveolus shallow; the excretory aper- ture is surrounded by a protuberant lip. The Muciparous glands of the small intestine seem to exist chiefly in the lamellated mucous membrane, and especially on the valvulse conniventes, where they appear to take the place of simple follicles. They occur in patches as large as a lentil, but perfectly flat and identical in structure with the mucous membrane of the large intestine, consisting of a reticular framework and alveoli. The septa, somewhat thicker than those of the large intestine, measure about of an inch in breadth, and contain from two to four rows of minute capillaries, which form a plexus with close618 MUSCULAR COAT OP THE INTESTINE. meshes. The alveoli are polygonal, for the most part hexagonal in form, and somewhat larger than those of the large intestine, mea- suring between and 2tit ^^^h in longest diameter. Each contains a muciparous gland, which forms its floor, and the gland is furnished with a central excretory open- ing. Around the circumference of the glandular patch the reticular structure is imperceptibly lost in the lamellated villi of the mucous membrane. Muscular coat.—The muscular coat of the pharynx consists of five pairs of muscles, which have been already de- scribed. The muscular coat of the rest of the alimentary canal is composed of two planes of fibres, an external longi- tudinal and an internal circular. The CEsophagus is very muscular; its longitudinal fibres commence by three fasciculi, two lateral, which are continuous with the in- ferior constrictor, and one anterior, which is attached to the verti- cal ridge of the cricoid cartilage. The circular fibres are attached superiorly to the cricoid cartilage; they are transverse in their ar- rangement above and below, but spiral in the middle of the oeso- phagus. Below, both sets of fibres are continued on to the stomach. In addition to the proper muscular fibres of the oesophagus, Hyrtl has described two special muscles in connexion with this tube, broncho-oesophageal and pleuro-oesophageal. The Broncho-mophageal muscle arises as a broad fasciculus from the posterior surface of the left bronchus, and is lost, after a course of two or three inches in length, among the longitudinal fibres of the left side of the oesophagus. The Pleuro-oesophageal muscle arises from the left wall of the posterior mediastinum behind the commencement of the descending aorta, and curves around that vessel to mingle its fibres with the longitudinal fibres of the oeso- phagus. On the Stomach the longitudinal fibres, descending from the oeso- phagus, spread out in a radiated manner around the cardiac orifice and great end of the organ, and take their course towards the lesser end; they are most apparent along the lesser curve. The circular * A portion of the free border of one of the valvnlae eonniventes of the jejunum, magnified 19 times, and showing an alveolar and glandular structure, not hitherto described.

Fig. 216.^SEROUS COAT OF THE INTESTINE. 619 fibres are most abundant at the lesser end, and at the pylorus are aggregated into a thick circular ring, which, with the spiral fold of mucous membrane found in this situation, constitutes the 'pyloric valve. At the great end of the stomach a new order of fibres is introduced, having for their object to strengthen and compress that extremity of the organ. They are directed more or less horizontally from the great end towards the lesser end, and are generally lost upon the sides of the stomach at about its middle; these are the oblique fibres. They are most numerous at the upper part of the cul-de-sac, near the cardiac orifice. In the Small intestine the muscular coat is thicker in the duo- denum and jejunum than in the ileum; the longitudinal fibres are most numerous along the free border of the intestine; and the circular fibres are more or less oblique in direction. At the termi- nation of the ileum the circular fibres are continued into the two folds of the ileo-csecal valve, while the longitudinal fibres pass onwards to the large intestine. In the Large intestine the longitudinal fibres commence at the appendix vermiformis and are collected into three bands, anterior, broad; and two posterior and narrower bands. These bands are nearly one-half shorter than the intestine, and serve to maintain the sacculated structure which is characteristic of the caecum and colon. In ;the descending colon the posterior bands usually unite and form a single band. From this point the bands are continued downwards upon the sigmoid flexure to the rectum, around which they spread out and form a thick and very muscular longitudinal layer. The circular fibres in the caecum and colon are thin; in the rectum they are thicker, and near its lower extremity are aggregated into the thick muscular band which is known as the internal sphincter ani. Between the latter and the mucous membrane are several narrow fasciculi of longitudinal muscular fibres, somewhat more than an inch in length, which have been described by Horner of Philadelphia. Serous coat.—The pharynx and oesopha-gus have no covering of serous membrane. The alimentaiy canal within the abdomen has a serous layer, derived from the peritoneum. The Stomach is completely surrounded by peritoneum, excepting along the line of attachment of the great and lesser omentum. The first or oblique portion of the duodenum, is also completely included by the serous membrane, with the exception of the points of attach- ment of the omenta. The descending portion has only a partial covering on its anterior surface, derived from the right meso-colon. The transverse portion is also behind the peritoneum, being situated between the two layers of the transverse meso-colon, and has but a partial covering. The rest of the small intestine is completely in- vested by it, excepting along the concave border (margo mesen- terialis) to which the mesentery is attached. The ccecum is more or less invested by the peritoneum, the more frequent dispositionTHE LIVER. 620 being that in which the intestine is surrounded for three-fourths only of its circumference.

The transverse colon is invested completely, with the exception of the lines of attachment of the greater omentum and transverse meso-colon. And the sig- moid flexure is entirely surrounded, with the exception of the part corresponding with the junction of the left meso-colon. The upper third of the rectum is completely enclosed by the peritoneum; the middle third has an anterior covering only, and the inferior third none whatsoever. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the alimentary canal, as they supply the tube from above downwards, are the pterygo-palaiine, ascending pharyngeal, superior thyroid, and inferior thyroid, in the neck; oesophageal, in the thorax; gastric, hepatic, splenic, superior and inferior mesenteric, in the abdomen ; and inferior mesenteric, internal iliac, and internal pudic, in the pelvis. The veins from the abdominal alimentary canal unite to form the vena portee. The lymphatics and lacteals open into the thoracic duct. The Nerves of the pharynx and oesophagus are derived from the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and sympathetic. The nerves of the stomach are the pneumogastric, and sympathetic branches from the solar plexus; and those of the intestinal canal are the superior and inferior mesenteric and hypogastric plexuses. The ex- tremity of the rectum is supplied by the inferior sacral nerves from the spinal cord. THE LIVER. The liver is a conglomerate gland of large size, appended to the alimentary canal, and performing the double office of separating im- purities from the venous blood of the chylo-poietic viscera previously to its return into the general venous circulation, and of secreting a fluid necessary to chylification, the bile. It is the largest organ in the body, weighing about four pounds, and measuring through its longest diameter about twelve inches. It is situated in the right hypochondriac region, and extends across the epigastrium into the left hypochondrium, frequently reaching, by its left extremity, the upper end of the spleen. It is placed obliquely in the abdomen; its convex surface looking upwards and forwards, the concave downwards and backwards. The anterior border is sharp and free, and marked by a deep notch, and the posterior rounded and broad. It is in relation, superiorly and posteriorly, with the diaphragm ; inferiorly, with the stomach, ascending portion of the duodenum, transverse colon, right supra-renal capsule, and right kidney; and corresponds, by its free border, with the lower margin of the ribs. Ligaments.—The liver is retained in its place by five ligaments, four of which are duplicatures of the peritoneum, situated on the convex surface of the organ; the fifth is a fibrous cord which passes621 LIGAMENTS OF THE LIVEK. through a fissure in its under surface, from the umbilicus to the inferior vena cava. They are the— Longitudinal, Coronary, Two lateral, Round. The Longitudinal ligament {broad, ligamentum suspensorium hepatis) is an antero-posterior fold of peritoneum, extending from the^notch on the anterior margin of the liver to its posterior border. Between its two layers, in the anterior and free margin, is the round ligament. The Lateral ligaments are formed by the two layers of perito- neum, which pass from the under surface of the diaphragm to the posterior border of the liver; they correspond with its lateral lobes. The Coronary ligament is formed by the separation of the two layers forming the lateral ligaments near their point of convergence. Fig. 217.* The posterior layer is continued unbroken from one lateral ligament to the other; but the anterior quits the posterior at each side, and is continuous with the corresponding layer of the longitudinal liga- ment. In this way a large oval surface on the posterior border of the liver is left uncovered by peritoneum, and is connected to the diaphragm by cellular tissue. This space is formed principally by the right lateral ligament, and is pierced near its left extremity by * The upper surface of the hver. 1. The right lobe. 2. The left lobe. 3.

The Round ligament is a fibrous cord resulting from the oblitera- tion of the umbilical vein, and situated between the two layers of peritoneum in the anterior border of the longitudinal ligament. It may be traced from the umbilicus through the longitudinal fissure of the under surface of the liver to the inferior vena cava, to which it is connected. Fissures.—The under surface of the liver is marked by five fis- sures, which divide its surface into five compartments or lobes, two principal and three minor lobes ; they are the— The Longitudinal fissure is a deep groove running from the notch upon the anterior margin of the liver, to the posterior border of the organ. At about one-third from its posterior extremity it is joined by a short but deep fissure, the transverse, which meets it trans- versely from the under part of the right lobe. The longitudinal fissure in front of this junction lodges the fibrous cord of the umbilical vein, and is generally crossed by a band of hepatic substance called the pons hepatis. The Fissure for the ductus venosus is the shorter portion of the longitudinal fissure, ' extending from the junctional termination of the transverse fissure to the posterior border of the liver, and con- taining a small fibrous cord, the remains of the ductus venosus. This fissure is therefore but a part of the longitudinal fissure. The Transverse fissure is the short and deep fissure, about two inches in length, through which the hepatic ducts quit and the hepatic artery and portal vein enter the liver. Hence this fissure was considered by the older anatomists as the gate (porta) of the liver; and the large vein entering the organ at this point, the portal vein. At their entrance into the transverse fissure the branches of the hepatic duct are the most anterior, next those of the artery, and most posteriorly the portal vein. The Fissure for the gall-Madder is a shallow fossa extending forwards, parallel with the longitudinal fissure, from the right ex- tremity of the transverse fissure to the free border of the liver, where it frequently forms a notch. The Fissure for the vena cava is a deep and short fissure, occa- sionally a circular tunnel, which proceeds from a little behind the right extremity of the transverse fissure to the posterior border of the liver, and lodges the inferior vena cava.

Viewing them in this way, the two anterior branches represent the longitudinal fissure on the left, and the fissure for the gall-bladder on the right side; the two posterior, the fissure for the ductus venosus on the left, and the fissure for the vena cava on the right; and the connecting bar, the transverse fissure. Lobes.—The right lobe is four or six times larger than the left, from which it is separated, on the concave surface, by the longitu- dinal fissure, and, on the convex, by the longitudinal ligament. It is marked upon its under surface by the transverse fissure, and by the fissures for the gall-bladder and vena cava; and presents three depressions, one, in front, for the curve of the ascending colon (impressio colica), and two behind, for the right supra-renal capsule and kidney (impressio renalis). The Left lobe is small and flattened, convex upon its upper sur- Fig. 218* i3 * The tinder surface of the liver. 1, The right lobe. 2. The left lobe. 3. The lobus quadratus. 4. The lobus Spigelii. 5.

It is sometimes in contact by its extremity with the upper end of the spleen, and is in relation, by its posterior border, with the cardiac orifice of the stomach and left pneumo- gastric nerve. The Lobus quadratus is a quadrilateral lobe situated on the under surface of the right lobe: it is bounded, in front, by the free border of the liver; behind, by the transverse fissure ; to the right, by the gall-bladder ; and to the left, by the longitudinal fissure. The Lobus Spigelii* is a small triangular lobe, also situated on the under surface of the right lobe: it is bounded, in front, by the transverse fissure ; and, on the sides, by the fissures for the ductus venosus and vena cava. The Lobus caudatus is a small tail-like appendage of the lobus Spigelii, from which it runs outwards like a crest into the right lobe, and serves to separate the right extremity of the transverse fis- sure from the commencement of the fissure for the vena cava. In some persons this lobe is well marked, in others it is small and ill- defined. Reverting to the comparison of the fissures with an inverted y, it will be observed, that the quadrilateral interval, in front of the transverse bar, represents the lobus quadratus ; the triangular space behind the bar, the lobus Spigelii; and the apex of the letter, the point of union between the inferior vena cava and the obliterated cord of the ductus venosus. Vessels and Nerves.—The vessels entering into the structure of the liver are silsofive in number ; they are the— Hepatic artery, Hepatic veins, Lymphatics. Portal vein, Hepatic ducts. The Hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic duct, enter the liver at the transverse fissure, and ramify through portal canals to every part of the organ ; so that their general direction is from below upwards, and from the centre towards the circumference. The Hepatic veins commence at the circumference, and proceed from before backwards, to open into the vena cava on the posterior border of the liver. Hence the branches of the two veins cross "each other in their course. The portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic duct are moreover enveloped in a loose cellular tissue, the capsule of Grlisson, which permits them to contract upon themselves when emptied of their contents ; the hepatic veins, on the contrary, are closely adherent by their parietes to the surface of the canals in which they run, and are unable to contract. By these characters the anatomist is enabled, in any section of the liver, to distinguish at once the most minute * Adrian Spigel, a Belgian physician, professor at Padua, after Casserius in 1616. He assigned considerable importance to this little lobe, but it had been described by Sylvius full sixty years before his time.STEUCTUEAL ANATOMY OP THE LIVEE. 625 brancli of the portal vein from an hepatic vein; the former will be found more or less collapsed, and always accompanied by an artery and duct, and the latter widely open and solitary. The Lymphatics of the liver are described in the Chapter dedicated to those vessels. The Nerves of the liver are derived from the systems both of animal and organic life; the former proceed from the right phrenic and right pneumogastric nerve, the latter from the hepatic plexus. Structure and Minute Anatomy of the Liver. The Liver is composed of lobules, of a connecting medium called Glisson's capsule, of the ramifications of the portal vein, hepatic dtict, hepatic artery, hepatic veins, lymphatics, and nerves, and is enclosed and retained in its situation by the peritoneum. The Lobules are small granu- lar bodies of about the size of a millet seed, of irregular form, and presenting a number of rounded prominences on their surface. When divided longitudinally, they have a foliated appearance, and transversely, a polygonal outline, with sharp or rounded angles, according to the smaller or greater quantity of Glisson's capsule contained in the liver. Each lobule is divided upon its exterior into a base and a capsular surface. The base corresponds with one extremity of the lobule, is flattened, and rests upon an hepatic vein, which is ^thence named sublobular. The capsidar surface includes the rest of the periphery ^3- 220.t of the lobule, and has received its designation from being en- closed in a cellular capsule de- rived from the capsule of Grlisson. In the centre of each lobule is a small vein, the intralobular,w]xich. is formed by the convergence of six or eight minute venules from * The lobules of the liver.

The intralobular vein thus constituted takes its course through the centre of the longitu- dinal axis of the lobule, pierces the middle of its base, and opens into the sublobular vein. The periphery of the lobule, with the ex- ception of its base, which is always closely attached to a sublobular vein, is connected by means of its cellular capsule with the capsular surfaces of surrounding lobules. The interval between the lobules is the interlobular fissure, and the angular interstices formed by the apposition of several lobules are the interlobular spaces. The lobules of the centre of the liver are angular, and somewhat smaller than those of the surface, from the greater compression to which they are submitted. The superficial lobules are incomplete, and give to the surface of the organ the appearance and all the ad- vantages resulting from an examination of a transverse section. " Each lobule is composed of a plexus of biliary ducts, of a venous plexus, formed by branches of the portal vein, of a branch (intra- lobular) of an hepatic vein, and of minute arteries ; nerves and ab- sorbents, it is to be presumed, also enter into their formation, but cannot be traced into them." " Examined with the microscope, a lobule is apparently composed of numerous minute bodies of a yellowish colour and of various forms, connected with each other by vessels. These minute bodies are the acini of Malpighi." "If an uninjected lobule be examined and contrasted with an injected lobule, it will be found that the acini of Malpighi in the former are identical with the injected lobular biliary plexus in the latter, and the blood-vessels in both will be easily distinguished from the In ultimate structure the lobules are composed of nucleated cells, centre to the circumference of the lobule. Glisson's capsule is the cellulo-fibrous tissue which envelopes the hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic duct, during their passage through the right border of the lesser omentum, and which continues * The Anatomy and Physiology of the Liver, by Mr. Kiernan, Phil. Trans. 1833, from which thig and the other paragraphs within inverted commas, on the structure of the Hver, are quoted. t Hepatic cells, magnified 310 times, and drawn with the camera lucida. ducts.

The nucleus in their interior is dis- tinct and nucleolated, and, like other parent cells, the rest of the cavity is filled with secondary cells and granules; sometimes they also contain oil globules. The hepatic cells are arranged in rows which radiate from theSTEUCTURAL ANATOMY OP THE LIVER. 627 to surround them to their ultimate distribution in the substance of the lobules. It forms for each lobule a distinct capsule, which in- vests it on all sides with the exception of its base, connects all the lobules together, and constitutes the proper capsule of the entire organ. But Glisson's capsule is not mere cellular tissue ; " it is to the liver what the pia mater is to the brain ; it is a cellulo-vas- cular membrane, in which the vessels divide and subdivide to an extreme degree of minuteness ; which lines the portal canals, form- ing sheaths for the larger vessels contained in them, and a web in which the smaller vessels ramify ; which enters the interlobular fissures, and with the vessels forms the capsules of the lobules ; and which finally enters the lobules, and with the blood-vessels ex- pands itself over the secreting biliary ducts." Hence arises a natu- ral division of the capsule into three portions, vaginal, inter- lobular, and lobular. The vaginal portion is that which invests the hepatic artery, hepatic duct, and portal vein, in the portal canals ; in the large canals it completely surrounds these vessels, but in the smaller is situated only on that side which is occupied by the artery and duct. The interlobular portion occupies the interlobular fissures and spaces, and the lobular portion forms the supporting tissue of the substance of the lobules. The Portal vein, entering the liver at the transverse fissure, ramifies through its structure in canals, which resemble, by their surfaces, the external superficies of the liver, and are formed by the capsular surfaces of the lobules. These are the portal canals, and contain, besides the portal vein with its ramifications, the artery and duct with their branches. In the larger canals, the vessels are separated from the parietes by a web of Glisson's capsule; but in the smaller, the portal vein is in contact with the surface of the canal for about two-thirds of its cylinder, the opposite third being in relation with the artery and duct and their investing capsule. If, therefore, the portal vein were laid open by a longitudinal incision in one of these smaller canals, the coats being transparent, the outline of the lobules, bounded by their interlobular fissures, would be as distinctly seen as upon the external surface of the liver, and the smaller venous branches would be observed entering the interlobular spaces. The branches of the portal vein are, the vaginal, interlobular, and lobular. The vaginal branches are those which, being given off in the portal canals, have to pass through the sheath (vagina) of Glisson's capsule, previously to entering the interlobular spaces. In this course they form an intricate plexus, the vaginal 2^lexus,w]iiGh., depending for its existence on the capsule of Glisson, necessarily surrounds the vessels, as does that capsule in the larger canals, and occupies the capsular side only in the smaller canals. The inter- lobular branches are given off from the vaginal portal plexus where it exists, and directly from the portal veins, in that part of the s s 2STRUCTURAL ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. 628 smaller canals where the coats of the vein are in contact with the walls of the canal. They then enter the interlobular spaces and divide into branches, which cover with their ramifications every part of the surface of the lobules, with the exception of their bases and those extremities of the superficial lobules which appear upon the surfaces of the liver. The interlobular veins communicate freely with each other, and with the corresponding veins of adjoining fissures, and establish a general portal anastomosis throughout the entire liver. The lobular branches are derived from the interlobu- lar veins; they form a plexus within each lobule, and converge from the circumference towards the centre, where they terminate in the minute radicles of the intralobular vein. '' This plexus, inter- posed between the interlobular portal veins and the intralobular hepatic vein, constitutes the venous part of the lobule, and may be calledi t}iQ lobular venous plexus.''"' The regular islets of the sub- stance of the lobules, seen between the meshes of this plexus by means of the microscope, are the acini of Malpighi, and are portions of the lobular biliary plexus. The portal vein returns the venous blood from the chylopoietic viscera, to be circulated through the lobules; it also receives the venous blood which results from the distribution of the hepatic artery. The Hepatic duct, entering the liver at the transverse fissure, divides into branches, which ramify through the portal canals, with the portal vein and hepatic artery, to terminate in the substance of the lobules. Its branches, like those of the portal vein, are vaginal, interlobular, and lobular. The Vaginal branches ramify through the capsule of Grlisson, and form a vaginal biliary plexus, which, like the vaginal portal plexus, surrounds the vessels in the large canals, but is deficient on that side of the smaller canals near which the duct is placed. The branches given off by the vaginal biliary plexus are interlobular and lobular. The interlobular branches proceed from the vaginal biliary plexus where it exists, and directly from the hepatic duct on that side of the smaller canals against which the duct is placed. They enter the interlobular spaces, and ramify upon the capsular surface of the lobules in the interlobular fissures, where they communicate freely with each other. The lobular diicts are derived chiefly from the interlobular ; but to those lobules forming the walls of the portal canals, they pass directly from the vaginal plexus. They enter the lobule, and form a plexus in its interior, the lobidar biliary plexus, which constitutes the principal part of the substance of the lobule. The ducts terminate either in loops or in ceecal extremities. The coats of the duct are very vascular, and are supplied with a number of mucous follicles, which are distributed irregularly in the larger, but are arranged in two parallel longitudinal rows in the smaller ducts.STRUCTUBAL ANATOMY OP THE LIVER. 629 The Hepatic artery enters the liver with the portal vein and hepatic duct, and ramifies with those vessels through the portal canals. Its branches are the vaginal, interlobular, and lobular. The vaginal branches, like those of the portal vein and hepatic duct, form a vaginal plexus, which exists throughout the whole extent of the portal canals, with the exception of that side of the smaller canals which corresponds with the artery. The interlobular branches, arising from the vaginal plexus and from the parietal side of the artery (in the smaller canals), ramify through the interlobu- lar fissures, and are principally distributed to the coats of the inter- lobular ducts. '' From the superficial interlobular fissures small arteries emerge, and ramify in the proper capsule, on the convex and concave sur- face of the liver, and in the ligaments. These are the capsular arteries.'''' Where the capsule is well developed, " these vessels cover the surfaces of the liver with a beautiful plexus," and anas- tomose with branches of the phrenic, internal mammary, and supra- renal arteries," and with the epigastric. The Lobular branches, extremely minute and few in number, are the nutrient vessels of the lobules, and terminate in the lobular venous plexus. 1 All the venous blood resulting from the distribution of the hepatic artery, even that from the vasa vasorum of the hepatic veins, is re- turned into the portal vein. The Hepatic veins commence in the substance of each lobule by minute venules, which receive the blood from the lobular venous plexus, and converge to form the intralobular vein. The intra- lobular vein passes through the central axis of the lobule, and through the middle of its base, to terminate in a sublobular vein ; and the union of the sublobular veins constitutes the hepatic trunks, which open into the inferior vena cava. The hepatic venous system consists, therefore, of three sets of vessels ; intralobular veins, sublobular veins, and hepatic trunks. The Sublobular veins are contained in canals formed solely by the bases of the lobules, with which, from the absence of Grlisson's capsule, they are in immediate contact. Their coats are thin and transparent; and, if they be laid open by a longitudinal incision, the bases of the lobules will be distinctly seen, separated by inter- lobular fissures, and perforated through the centre by the opening of the intralobular vein. The Hepatic trunks are formed by the union of the sublobular veins ; they are contained in canals (hepatic-venous) similar in structure to the portal canals, and lined by a prolongation of the proper capsule. They proceed from before backwards, and termi- nate, by two large openings (corresponding with the right and left lobe of the liver) and several smaller apertures, in the inferior vena cava. Summary.—The liver has been shown to be composed of lobules;630 STRUCTURAL ANATOMY OP THE LIVER. the lobules (excepting at their bases) are invested and connected together, the vessels supported, and the whole organ enclosed, by Glisson^s capsule; and they are so arranged, that the base of every lobule in the liver is in contact with an hepatic vein (sublobular). The Portal vein distributes its numberless branches through portal canals, which are channeled through every part of the organ; it brings the returning blood from the chylopoietic viscera ; it col- lects also the venous blood from the ultimate ramifications of the hepatic artery in the liver itself. It gives off branches in the canals, which are called vaginal, and form & Tenons vaginal plexus ; these give off interlobular branches, and the latter enter the lobules and form lobular venous plexuses, from the blood circulating in which the bile is secreted. The Bile in the lobule is received by a network of minute ducts, the lobular biliary plexus; it is conveyed from the lobule into the interlobular ducts; it is thence poured into the biliary vaginal plexus of the portal canals, and thence into the excreting ducts, by which it is carried to the duodenum and gall-bladder, after being mingled in its course with the mucous secretion from numberless muciparous follicles in the walls of the ducts. The Hepatic artery distributes branches through every portal canal; gives off vaginal branches which form a vaginal hepatic plexus, from which the interlobular branches arise, and these latter terminate ultimately in the lobular venous plexuses of the portal vein. The artery ramifies abundantly in the coats of the hepatic ducts, enabling them to provide their mucous secretion ; and sup- plies the vasa vasorum of the portal and hepatic veins, and the nu- trient vessels of the entire organ. The Hepatic veins commence in the centre of each lobule by minute radicles, which collect the impure blood from the lobular venous plexus and convey it into the intralobular veins; these open into the sublobular veins, and the sublobular veins unite to form the large hepatic trunks by which the blood is conveyed into the vena cava. Physiological and pathological deductions.—The physiological deduction arising out of this anatomical arrangement is, that the bile is wholly secreted from venous blood, and not from a mixed venous and arterial blood, as stated by MiiUer ; for although the portal vein receives its blood from two sources, viz., from the chylo- poietic viscera and from the capillaries of the hepatic artery, yet the fact of the blood of the latter vessel having passed through its capillaries into the portal vein, or in extremely small quantity into the capillary network of the lobular venous plexus, is sufficient to establish its venous character. * The pathological deductions depend upon the following facts :— Each lobule is a perfect gland ; of uniform structure, of uniform colour, and possessing the same degree of vascularity throughout. It is the seat of a double venous circulation, the vessels of the one * For arguments on this contested question, see the article "Liver," in the ** Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology."631 GALL-BLADDER. {hepatic) being situated in the centre of the lobule, and those of the other {portal) in the circumference. Now the colour of the lobule, as of the entire liver, depends chiefly upon the proportion of blood contained within these two sets of vessels; and so long as the circu- lation is natural, the colour will be uniform. But the instant that any cause is developed which shall interfere with the free circulation of either, there will be an immediate diversity in the colour of the lobule. Thus, if there be any impediment to the free circulation of the venous blood through the heart or lungs, the circulation in the he- patic veins will be retarded, and the sublobular and the intralobular veins will become congested, giving rise to a more or less extensive redness in the centre of each of the lobules, while the marginal or non-congested portion presents a distinct border of a yellowish white, yellow, or green colour, according to the quantity and quality of the bile it may contain. '' This is ''passive congestion' of the liver, the usual and natural state of the organ after death;" and, as it com- mences with the hepatic vein, it may be called the first stage of hepatic-venous congestion. But if the causes which produced this state of congestion continue, or be from the beginning of a more active kind, the congestion will extend through the lobular venous plexuses '' into those branches of the portal vein situated in the interlobular fissures, but not to those in the spaces, which being larger, and giving origin to those in the fi^ssures, are the last to be congested." In this second stage the liver has a mottled appearance, the non-congested substance is ar- ranged in isolated, circular, and ramose patches, in the centres of which the spaces and parts of the fissures are seen. This is an ex- tended degree of hepatic-venous congestion; it is " active conges- tion'^ of the liver, and very commonly attends disease of the heart and lungs. These are instances of partial congestion, but there is sometimes general congestion of the organ. " In general congestion the whole liver is of a red colour, but the central portions of the lobules are usually of a deeper hue than the marginal portions." GALL-BLADDER. The Gall-bladder (fig. 154) is the reservoir of the bile; it is a pyriform sac, situated in a fossa on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, and extending from the right extremity of the transverse fissure to the free margin. It is divided into a body, fundus, and neck : the fundus or broad extremity in the natural position of the liver is placed downwards, and frequently projects beyond the free margin of the liver, while the neck, small and con- stricted, is directed upwards. This sac is composed of three coats, serous, fibrous, and mucous. The serous coat is partial, is derived from the peritoneum, and covers that side only which is unattached to the liver. The middle or fibrous coat is a thin but strong fibrous632 THE PANCREAS. layer, connected on one side to tlie liver, and on the other to the peritoneum. The internal or mucous coat is but loosely attached to the fibrous layer; it is everywhere raised into minute rugse, which give it a beautifully reticulated appearance ; and it forms, at the neck of the sac, a spiral valve. It is continuous through the hepatic duct with the mucous membrane lining all the ducts of the liver, and through the ductus communis choledochus, with the mucous mem- brane of the alimentary canal. The Biliary ducts are, the hepatic, cystic, and ductus communis choledochus. The Hepatic duct, nearly two inches long, is formed in the trans- verse fissure of the liver by the junction of two ducts which proceed from the right and left lobes. It joins the cystic duct at an acute angle, and the common duct resulting from their union is the ductus communis choledochus. The Cystic duct, about an inch in length, passes inwards from the neck of the gall-bladder, and unites at an acute angle with the pre- ceding. The Ductus communis choledochus (%oX^ bilis,^£%o/zat recipio) is the common excretory duct of the liver and gall-bladder; it is about three inches in length, and is formed by the junction of the hepatic with the cystic duct. It descends through the right border of the lesser omentum, and behind the descending portion of the duodenum to the inner side of that intestine, where it terminates by passing obliquely between the muscular and mucous coat, and opening on the summit of a papilla which is common to it and the pancreatic duct. The papilla is situated near the lower part of the descending portion of the duodenum on its inner side ; and the duct is constricted in size during its passage between the coats of the intestine. The coats of the biliary ducts are an external or fibrous, and an internal or mucous coat. The external coat is composed of a con- tractile fibrous tissue, which is probably muscular ; but its muscu- larity has not yet been demonstrated in the human subject. The mucous coat is continuous on the one hand with the lining mem- brane of the hepatic ducts and gall-bladder, and on the other with that of the duodenum. Vessels and Nerves.—The gall-bladder is supplied with blood by the cystic artery, a branch of the hepatic. Its veins return their blood into the portal vein. The nerves are derived from the hepatic plexus. THE PANCREAS. The pancreas is a long, flattened, conglomerate gland, analogous to the salivary glands. It is about six inches in length, and be- tween three and four ounces in weight; is situated transversely across the posterior wall of the abdomen, behind the stomach, and rests on the aorta, vena portse, inferior vena cava, the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, and the left kidney and supra-renal633 THE SPLEEN. capsule ; opposite the first and second lumbar vertebra. It is divided into a body, a greater, and a smaller extremity ; the great end or head is placed towards the right, and is surrounded by the curve of the duodenum ; the lesser end extends to the left as far as the spleen. The anterior surface of the body of the pancreas is co- vered by the ascending posterior layer of peritoneum, and is in rela- tion with the stomach, the first portion of the duodenum, and the com- mencement of the transverse arch of the colon. The posterior sur- face is grooved for the splenic vein, and tunnelled by a complete canal for the superior mesenteric and portal vein, and superior mesenteric artery. The upper border presents a deep groove, sometimes a canal, for the splenic artery and vein, and is in relation with the oblique portion of the duodenum, the lobus Spigelii, and coeliac axis. And the lower border is separated from the transverse por- tion of the duodenum by the superior mesenteric artery and vein. Upon the posterior part of the head of the pancreas is a lobular fold of the gland which completes the canal of the superior mesenteric vessels, and is called the lesser pancreas. In structure, the pancreas is composed of reddish-yellow polyhedral lobules; these consist of smaller lobules, and the latter are made up of the arborescent ramifications of minute ducts, terminating in cgecal P9uches. ' The pancreatic duct commences at the small extremity of the organ by two branches, which converge and unite after a course of about one-third the length of the gland. The duct is then continued onwards from left to right, gradually increasing in size, and lying nearer the anterior than the posterior surface of the organ, to the lower part of the descending duodenum, where it terminates on the papilla of mucous membrane, common to it and the ductus com- munis choledochus. The duct receives numerous branches which open into it on all sides from the lobules of the gland, and at its termination is slightly dilated and passes obliquely between the muscular and mucous coat of the intestine to reach the papilla. The duct which receives the secretion from the lesser pancreas is called the ductus pancreaticus minor; it opens into the principal duct near the duodenum, and sometimes passes separately into that intestine. As a variety, two pancreatic ducts are occasionally met with. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the pancreas are branches of the splenic, hepatic, and superior mesenteric; the veins open into the splenic vein; the lymphatics terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are filaments of the splenic plexus. THE SPLEEN. The spleen is an oblong flattened organ, of a dark bluish-red colour, situated in the left hypochondriac region. It is variable in size and weight,* spongy and vascular in texture, and exceedingly * Its ordinary length is about five inches; and its weight, six ounces.THE SPLEEN. 634 friable. The external surface is convex, tlie internal slightly con- cave, indented along tlie middle line, and pierced by several large and irregular openings for the entrance and exit of vessels; this is the Jiilum lienis. The upper extremity is somewhat larger than the lower, and rounded; the inferior is flattened; the posterior border is obtuse, the anterior sharp, and marked by several notches. The spleen is in relation by its external or convex surface with the diaphragm, which separates it from the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs; by its concave surface, with the great end of the stomach, the extremity of the pancreas, the gastro-splenic omentum and. its vessels, the left kidney and supra-renal capsule, and the left crus of the diaphragm; by its upper end with the diaphragm, and some- times with the extremity of the left lobe of the liver; and, by its lower end, with the left extremity of the transverse arch of the colon. It is connected to the stomach by the gastro-splenic omentum, and to the diaphragm by a fold of the peritoneum called the sus- pensory ligament. A second spleen (lien succenturiatus) is sometimes found appended to one of the branches of the splenic artery, near the great end of the stomach; when it exists, it is round and of small size, rarely larger than a hazel-nut. There are sometimes two, and even three, of these bodies. The spleen is invested by the peritoneum and by a tunica propria of elastic tissue, which enables it to yield to the greater or less dis- tension of its vessels. The elastic tunic forms sheaths for the vessels in their ramifications through the organ, and from these sheaths small fibrous bands (trabeculse) are given off in all direc- tions, which become attached to the internal surface of the elastic tunic, and constitute the areolar framework of the spleen. The substance occupying the interspaces of this tissue is soft, granular, and of a bright red colour, interspersed with small, white, soft cor- puscles (Malpighian bodies). These corpuscles, according to the re- searches of Oesterlen and Simon, are aggregations of cytoblasts enclosed in a kind of capsule of capillary vessels. There are, besides, separate cytoblasts abundantly scattered through the red substance. Vessels and Nerves.—The Splenic artery is of a very large size in proportion to the bulk of the spleen; it is a division of the cceliac axis. The branches which enter the spleen are distributed to distinct sections of the organ, and anastomose very sparingly with each other. The veins, by their numerous dilatations, constitute the principal part of the bulk of the spleen; they pour their blood into the splenic vein, which is one of the two great formative trunks of the portal vein. The lymphatics are remarkable for their number and large size; they ter- minate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are, the splenic plexus, derived from the solar plexus.635 THE SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. The supra-renal capsules are two small yellowish and flattened bodies surmounting the kidneys, and inclining inwards towards the vertebral column. The right is somewhat three-cornered in shape, the left semilunar; they are connected to the kidneys by the common investing cellular tissue, and each capsule is marked on its anterior surface by a fissure which appears to divide it into two lobes. The right supra-renal capsule is closely adherent to the posterior and under surface of the liver, the left lies in contact with the pancreas and spleen. Both capsules rest against the crura of the diaphragm on a level with the tenth dorsal vertebra, and, by their inner border, are in relation with the great splanchnic nerve and semilunar gang- lion. They are larger in the foetus than in the adult, and appear to perform some office connected with embryonic life. The anatomy of these organs in the foetus will be found in the succeeding chapter. In structure they are composed of two substances, cortical and medullary. The cortical substance is of a yellowish colour, and con- sists of straight parallel columns placed perpendicularly side by side. Tjbie medullary substance is generally of a dark brown colour, double the quantity of the yellow substance, soft and spongy in texture, and contains within its centre the trunk of a large vein, the vena supra- renalis. It is the large size of this vein that gives to the fresh supra- renal capsule the appearance of a central cavity : the dark-coloured pulpy or fluid contents of the capsule, at a certain period after death, are produced by softening of the medullary substance. Dr. Nagel* has shown, by his injections and microscopic examinations, that the appearance of columns in the cortical substance is caused by the di- rection of a plexus of capillary vessels. Of the numerous minute arteries, supplying the supra-renal capsule, he says, the greater num- ber enter the cortical substance at every point of its surface, and, after proceeding for scarcely half a line, divide into a plexus of straight capillary vessels. Some few of the small arteries traverse the cortical layer, and give ofl", in the medullary substance, several branches which proceed in different directions, and re-enter the cor- tical layer to divide into a capillary plexus in a similar manner with the first described. From the capillary plexus, composing the cortical layer, the blood is received by numerous small veins which form a venous plexus in the medullary substance, and terminate at acute angles in the large central vein. According to the more recent researches of Oesterlen and Simon, the appearance of columns is due to groups of small corpuscles or cytoblasts associated with elementary granules and fat-cells collected together in the form of parallel cylinders or cones, each group being * Miiller's Archiv. 1836.THE KIDNEYS. 636 enclosed in a tube of delicate membrane (limitary membrane). The medullary substance and intercolumnar spaces contain cytoblasts uniformly scattered and interspersed with granules and fat-cells. Oesterlen found also, occasionally, in the medullary substance, elon- gated spaces without lining membrane, containing a thick greyish- white fluid. Vessels and Nerves.-—The supra-renal arteries are derived from the aorta, from the renal, and from the phrenic arteries; they are remarkable for the innumerable minute twigs into which they divide previously to entering the capsule. The supra-renal vein collecting the blood from the medullary venous plexus, and receiving several branches which pierce the cortical layer, opens directly into the vena cava on the right side, and into the renal vein on the left. The Lymphatics are large and very numerous; they terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are derived from the renal and from the phrenic plexus. THE KIDNEYS. The kidneys, the secreting organs of the urine, are situated in the lumbar regions, behind the peri- toneum, and on each side of the vertebral column, extending from the eleventh rib to near the crest of the ilium, and approaching the vertebral column by their upper ends. Each kidney is between four and five inches in length, about two inches and a half in breadth, somewhat more than one inch in thickness, and weighs between three and five ounces. The kidneys are usually surrounded by fat; they rest on the crura of the diaphragm, on the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle, which separates them from the quadratus lumborum, and on the psoas magnus. The. right Icidney is somewhat lower than the left, from the position of the liver; it is in relation, by its anterior surface, with the liver and descend- * A section of the kidney, surmounted by the supra-renal capsule; the Swellings on the surface mark the original constitution of the organ of distinct lobes. 1.

The left kidney, higher than the right, is covered, in front, by the great end of the stomach, by the spleen, and descending colon. The anterior surface of the kidney is convex, while the posterior is flat; the superior extremity is in relation with the supra-renal capsule; the convex border is turned outwards towards the parietes of the abdomen; the concave border looks inwards towards the vertebral column, and presents a deep notch" (/w^i^m renale), which leads to a cavity, or sinus, within the organ. In the sinus renalis are situated the vessels and nerves of the kidney and the expansion of the excretory duct called pelvis renalis. At the hilum these vessels are so placed that the renal vein is in front of the artery, and the pelvis and ureter behind. The kidney is dense and fragile in texture, and invested by a proper fibrous capsule, which is easUy torn from its surface. When divided by a longitudinal incision, carried from the convex to the concave border, it is found to present in its interior two structures, an external or vascular (cortical), and an internal or tubular (medul- lary) substance. The tubular portion is formed of pale reddish- coloured conical masses, corresponding by their bases with the vas- cular structure, and by their apices with the hilum of the organ; these bddies are named cones (pyramids of Malpighi), and are from eight to fifteen in number. The vascular portion, about two lines in thick- ness, is composed of blood-vessels and the plexiform convolutions of uriniferous tubuli, and not only constitutes the surface of the kidney, but dips between the cones and surrounds them nearly to their apices (septula renum). The cones or pyramids of the tubular portion of the kidney are composed of minute straight tubuli uriniferi, of about the diameter of a fine hair. The tubuli commence at the apices of the cones, and pursue a parallel course towards the periphery of the organ, bifurcating from point to point, and separated only by minute straight blood-vessels, and a small quantity of parenchymatous sub- stance. At the bases of the pyramids the tubuli collect into smaller conical fasciculi {pyramids of Ferrein), which are prolonged into the substance of the cortical portion of the kidney, and have inter- posed between them processes of the vascular structure. In the smaller pyramids the fasciculi separate into their component tubules, which, after a course marked by "tortuosities, plexuses, convolu- tions, and dilatations," terminate, according to Bowman,* in small round bodies, the corpora Malpighiana, or, according to Krause and Toynbee,f by anastomoses and csecal extremities. The average diameter of the tubuli uriniferi in the cortical portion of the kidney is the of an inch, of which about two-thirds are occupied by a * Ou the Structure and Use of the Malpighian Bodies of the Eadney.

According to Bowman, the epithelium is ciliated in that part of the tubule which is near the Malpighian body, the tubule itself being very much constricted. In the cortical portion of the kidney are contained a multitude of minute, red, globular bodies, the corpora Malpighiana, or glomeruli. Each Malpighian body, about of an inch in diameter, is com- posed of a plexus of capillary vessels, and, in addition, according to Toynbee, of a coil of an uriniferous tubule; the tuft of capillaries and the coil of the tubule being both enclosed in a thin, membranous capsule. According to Bowman, the capsule of the Malpighian body is the origin of the uriniferous tubule expanded into a globular form for the reception of the capillary tuft. The capillary vessels of the vascular tuft are arranged in loops closely packed together, and surrounded by an epithelium which is continuous with a similar structure lining the inner surface of the capsule. They are derived from a small artery, which, after piercing the capsule, immediately divides in a radiated manner into several branches. From the in- terior of this little vascular ball a vein proceeds, smaller than the corresponding artery, and pierces the capsule close by the artery, to communicate with the efferent vessels of other Malpighian bodies and constitute a venous plexus. The cones or mamillary processes of the interior of the kidney are invested by mucous membrane, which is continuous at their apices with the uriniferous tubuli, and is reflected from their sides so as to form around each a cup- like pouch, or calyx. The calices communicate with a common cavity of larger size, situated at each extremity, and in the middle of the organ; and these three cavities, the infundihula, constitute by their union the large membranous sac, which emerges through the hilum renale, the pelvis of the kidney. The kidney in the embryo and foetus consists of lobules. See the anatomy of the foetus in the suc- ceeding Chapter. * Plan of the renal circulation; copied from Mr. Bowman's paper, a.

The Ureter {ovqov, urine, rrjpeiv, to keep), the excretory duct of the kidney, is a memlDranous tube of about the diameter of a goose-quill, and nearly eighteen inches in length; it is continuous superiorly with the pelvis of the kidney, and is constricted inferiorly, where it lies in an oblique direction between the muscular and mucous coat of the base of the bladder, and opens upon its mucous surface. Lying along the posterior wall of the abdomen, it is situated behind the peritoneum, and is crossed by the spermatic vessels; in its course downwards it rests against the anterior surface of the psoas, and crosses the common iliac artery and vein, and then the external iliac vessels. Within the pelvis it crosses the hypogastric cord and vas deferens in the male, and runs by the side of the cervix uteri and upper part of the vagina in the female. There are sometimes two ureters to one kidney. The ureter, the pelvis, the infundibula, and the calices are composed of two coats, an external or fibro-cellular coat, the tunica propria; and an internal mucous coat, which is con- tinuous with the mucous membrane of the bladder inferiorly, and with that of the tubuli uriniferi above. The cells of the epithelium are spheroidal. Vessels and Nerves.—The renal artery is derived from the aorta; it divides into several large branches before entering the hilum, and witliin the organ ramifies in an arborescent manner, terminating in nutrient twigs, and in the small inferent vessels of the corpora Mal- pighiana. In the Malpighian bodies the inferent vessels divide into several primary twigs, which subdivide into capillaries, and the capil- laries, after forming loops, converge to the efferent vein, which is generally smaller than the corresponding artery. The efferent veins proceed to and form a capillary venous plexus, which surrounds the tortuous tubuli uriniferi, and from this venous plexus the blood is conveyed, by converging branches, into the renal vein. "Thus," remarks Bowman, "there are in the kidney two per- fectly distinct systems of capillary vessels, through both of which the blood passes in its course from the arteries into the veins; the first, that" which forms the vascular tuft in the Malpighian bodies, and is "in immediate connexion with the arteries; the second, that enveloping the convolutions of the tubes and communicating directly with the veins. The efferent vessels of the Malpighian bodies, that carry the blood between these two systems, may collectively be termed the portal system of the kidney." The inferences drawn by Bowman from his investigations are interesting; they are, that the capillary tufts of the Malpighian bodies are the part of the kidney specially acted on by diuretics; that they are the medium by which water, cer- tain salts, and other substances, pass out of the system; that they are, moreover, the means of escape of certain morbid products, such as sugar, albumen, and the red particles of the blood. Respecting the capillary venous plexus, we have proof that the principal proxi- mate constituents of urine, such as urea, lithic acid, &c., are, like the bile, derived from venous (portal) blood.640 VISCERA OP THE PELVIS. Tlie Veins of the kidney commence at the surface by minute con- verging venules, the stellated vessels, and proceed inwards, receiving in their course the veins of the cortical and tubular portion of the organ. On arriving at the pelvis, they unite to form the branches of the renal vein, which terminates in the vena cava by a single large trunk on each side; the left renal vein receiving the left spermatic vein. ■ Injections thrown into the renal artery, and returning by the tubuli uriniferi, make their way into those tubes by rupture. The lymphatic vessels terminate in the lumbar glands. The Nerves are derived from the renal plexus, which is formed partly by the solar plexus, and partly by the third splanchnic nerve. The renal plexus gives branches to the spermatic plexus, and branches which accompany the ureters : hence the morbid sympathies which exist between the kidney, the ureter, and the testicle: and by the communications with the solar plexus, with the stomach and dia- phragm, and indeed with the whole system. In the intimate structure of the kidney, the nerve-fibres are, according to Toynbee, continuous with the nucleated cells of the parenchyma of the organ. PELVIS. The cavity of the pelvis is that portion of the great abdominal cavity which is included within the bones of the pelvis, below the level of the linea-ilio-pectinea and the promontory of the sacrum. It is bounded by the cavity of the abdomen above, and by the perineum below; its internal parietes are formed, in front, below, and at the sides, by the peritoneum, pelvic fascia, levatores ani and obturator muscles; and behind, by the coccygei muscles, sacro-ischiatic liga- ments, pyriformis muscle, sacral plexus of nerves, sacrum and coccyx. The Viscera of the pelvis in the male are, the urinary bladder, prostate gland, vesiculse seminales, and rectum. The Bladder is a hollow membranous viscus, triangular and flattened against the pubes when empty, ovoid when distended, situated behind the pubes and in front of and upon the rectum. It is larger in its vertical diameter than from side to side; and its long axis is directed from above, obliquely downwards and backwards. It is divided into body, fundus, base, and neck. The hody com- prehends the middle zone of the organ ; the fundus (superior fundus) its upper segment; the base (inferior fundus), the lower broad ex- tremity which rests on the rectum ; and the necJc, the narrow con- stricted portion which is applied against the prostate gland. It is retained in position by ligaments which are divisible into true and f^lse: the true ligaments are five in number, two anterior, two lateral, and the cord of the urachus; the false ligaments are folds of the peritoneum, and are also five in number, two posterior, two lateral, and one superior.641 URINARY BLADDER. The anterior ligaments are formed by the recto-vesical fascia in its passage from the inner surface of the pubes on each side of the symphysis to the neck of the bladder and prostate gland. The lateral ligaments are also formed by the recto-vesical fascia in its passage from the levatores ani muscles to the sides of the prostate gland and neck of the bladder. The ligament of the urachus is a fibrous cord resulting from the obliteration of a tubular canal (urachus) existing in the embryo. It proceeds from the summit of the bladder, and ascends along the linea alba to the umbilicus. The 2)osterior false ligaments are the fold of peritoneum formed on each side of the pelvis by the obliterated hypogastric artery ; this fold also contains the ureter and the vessels and nerves of the bladder. The lateral false ligaments are formed by the passage of the peri- toneum from the side of the pelvis to the side of the bladder. The obliterated hypogastric artery lies along the line of reflection of the membrane. The superior or suspensory false ligament is the fold of peritoneum caused by the prominence of the cord of the urachus and the cords of the obliterated hypogastric arteries. ;The bladder is composed of four coats, an external or serous, muscular, cellular, and mucous. The serous coat is partial, and derived from the peritoneum, which invests the posterior surface and sides of the bladder, from about opposite the point of termination of the ureters to its summit, whence it is guided to the anterior wall of the abdomen by the hy- pogastric cords and urachus. The muscular coat consists of two layers, an externallayer composed of longitudinal fibres, the detrusor urinse; and an internal layer of oblique and circular fibres irregularly distributed. The longitudinal fibres arise from the anterior liga- ments of the bladder (tendons of the detrusor urinse), the neck of that organ and the base of the prostate gland, and spread out as they ascend to the fundus; here a small fasciculus follows the course of the urachus, but the greater number converge upon the posterior surface of the organ and descend to its neck, where they are inserted into the isthmus of the prostate gland, and into a ring of muscular tissue, which surrounds the commencement of the prostatic portion of the urethra. In the female they are inserted into the vagina. The lateral fibres commence at the prostate gland and muscular ring of the urethra on one side, and spread out as they ascend upon the side of the bladder to descend upon the opposite side, and be inserted into the prostate and opposite segment of the same ring. Two bands of oblique fibres are described by Sir Charles Bell, as originating at the terminations of the ureters, and converging to the neck of the bladder : the existence of these muscles is not well established. The fibres corresponding with the trigonum vesicae are transverse. T T642 VISCERA OP THE PELVIS. Guthrie* observes that there are no fibres at the neck of the bladder capable of forming a sphincter vesicae; but Lanef has de- scribed a fasciculus of muscular fibres which surround the commence- ment of the urethra, and perform such an office. These fibres form a narrow bundle above the urethra, but spread out below, behind the prostate gland; they are brought into view by dissecting off the mucous membrane from around the orifice of the urethra. Sir Astley Cooper has described around the urethra, within the * " On the Anatomy and Diseases of the Neck of the Bladder and of the Urethra." t Lancet, vol. i. 1842-43, p. 670. % A side view of the viscera of the male pelvis, in situ.

It is into this ring that the longitudinal fibres of the detrusor urinse are inserted, so that the muscle, taking a fixed point at the pubes, will not only compress the bladder, and thereby tend to force its contents along the urethra, but will at the same time, by means of its attachment to the ring, dilate the entrance of the urethra, and afford a free egress to the contents of the bladder. The Cellular or submucous coat is the thick layer of cellular tissue, which is interposed between the mucous and muscular coat, and forms the bond of union between them. The mucous coat is thin and smooth, of a pale rose colour, and exactly moulded on the muscular coat, to which it is connected by the cellular coat; its papillae are very minute, and there are a number of mucous follicles, especially near the neck of the organ. This mucous membrane is continuous, through the ureters, with the lining membrane of the uriniferous ducts, tubuli seminiferi, and Cowper's glands. The cells of the epithelium are of the spheroidal kind. Upon the internal surface of the base of the bladder is a trian- gular smooth plane of a paler colour than the rest of the mucous membrane, the trigonum vesicae, or trigone vesicale (fig. 227). This is the most sensitive part of the bladder, and the pressure of calculi upon it gives rise to great suffering. It is bounded on each side by the raised ridge^, corresponding with the muscles of the ureters, at each posterior angle by the openings of the ureters, and, in front, by a slight elevation of the mucous membrane at the entrance of the urethra, called uvula vesicce. The external surface of the base of the bladder corresponding with the trigonum is also triangular, and separated from the rectum by a thin layer of fibrous membrane, derived from the recto-vesical fascia. It is bounded behind by the recto-vesical fold of perito- neum ; and on each side by the vas deferens and vesicula seminalis, which converge almost to a point at the base of the prostate gland. It is through this space that the opening is made in the recto-vesical operation for puncture of the bladder. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the urinary bladder are the superior vesical, three or four small branches which proceed from the commencement of the hypogastric artery, previously to its com- plete obliteration; and inferior vesical, from the internal iliac. The latter is distributed to the base of the bladder, vesiculge seminales, and prostate gland. The veins are numerous and of large size, and form a plexus around the neck and at the base of the bladder; the plexus communicates with the prostatic plexus and with the hsemor* rhoidal veins. The nerves of the bladder are derived from the infe- rior hypogastric plexuses and their communications with the third and fourth sacral nerves. T T 2 -644 PROSTATE GLAND. The prostate gland {Trpo'iaTiiixi, preeponere) is situated in front of the neck of the bladder, behind the triangular ligament and pelvic fascia, and upon the rectum, through which latter it may be felt with the finger. It surrounds the commencement of the urethra for a little more than an inch of its extent, and resembles a Spanish chesnut both in size and form; the base being directed backwards towards the neck of the bladder, the apex forwards, and the convex, side towards the rectum. It is retained firmly in position by the anterior and lateral ligaments of the bladder, and by a process of the recto-vesical fascia, which forms a sheath around it. It consists of three lobes, two lateral and a middle lobe or isthmus; the lateral lobes are distinguished by an indentation on the base of the gland, and a slight furrow upon its upper and lower surface. The third lobe or isthmus is a small transverse band which passes between the two lateral lobes at the base of the organ. In structure the prostate gland is composed of ramified ducts, terminating in lobules of follicular pouches, which are so closely compressed as to give to a thin section of the gland a cellular ap- pearance. It is pale in colour and hard in texture, splits easily in the course of its ducts, and is surrounded by a proper fibrous cover- ing, and by a plexus of veins which are enclosed by the sheath derived from the recto-vesical fascia. Its secretion is poured into the prostatic portion of the urethra by fifteen or twenty excretory ducts. The ducts of the lateral lobes open into the urethra on each side of the veru montanum; those of the third lobe open upon and behind the veru. The urethra, in passing through the prostate, lies one-third nearer its upper, than its lower, surface. The arteries of the prostate gland are small and derived from the inferior vesical and middle hsemorrhoidal. The veins form a plexus around the gland, which receives from the front the veins of the penis, and terminates in the vesical plexus. On the under surface of the base of the bladder, and converging towards the base of the prostate gland, are two lobulated and some- what'pyriform bodies, about two inches in length, the vesiculse semi- nales. Their upper surface is in contact with the base of the bladder ; the under side rests on the rectum, separated only by a process derived from the recto-vesical fascia; the larger extremities are directed backwards and outwards, and the smaller ends almost meet at the base of the prostate. They enclose between them a triangular space, which is bounded posteriorly by the recto-vesical fold of peritoneum, and corresponds with the trigonum vesicse on the interior of the bladder. Each vesicula is formed by the con- VESICUL^ SEMINALES.645 VESICULA SEMINALES. Fig. 225.* volutions of a single tube, which gives off several irregular csecal branches. It is enclosed in a fibrous membrane, derived from the recto-vesical fascia, and is constricted beneath the isthmus of the prostate gland into a small excretory duct. The vas deferens, somewhat enlarged and sacculated, lies along the inner border of each vesicula, and is in- cluded in its fibrous investment. It communicates with the duct of the vesicula, beneath the isthmus of the prostate, and forms the ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory duct is about three quarters of an inch in length, and running forwards, first between the base of the prostate and the isthmus, and then through the tissue of the veru montanum, opens on the mu- cous membrane of the urethra, by the , side of or within the aperture of the »sinus pocularis. In structure the vesiculse semi- nales are composed of three coats :— external, cellular; middle, fibrous and contractile; and internal or mucous, a thin mucous membrane, presenting a delicate reti- cular marking like that of the gall-bladder, and invested by a squamous epithelium. ■ MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION.

The dotted hue, forming the base of this triangular area, marks the extent of the recto-vesical fold of the peritoneum.646 PENIS. The Penis is divisible into a body, root, and extremity. The body is surrounded by a thin integument, which is remarkable for the looseness of its cellular connexion with the deeper parts of the organ, and for containing no adipose tissue. The root is broad, and firmly adherent to the rami of the pubes andischiumby means of two strong processes, the crura, and is connected to the symphysis pubis by a fibrous membrane, the ligamentum suspensorium. The extre- mity or glans penis resembles an obtuse cone, somewhat compressed from above downwards, and of a deeper red colour than the sur- rounding skin. At its apex is a small vertical slit, the meatus urinarius, which is bounded by two, more or less protuberant, labia; and, extending backwards from the meatus, is a depressed raphe,* to which is attached a loose fold of mucous membrane, the frsenum prseputii. The base of the glans is marked by a projecting collar, the corona glandis, upon which are seen a number of small papillary elevations, the glandulse Tysoni (odoriferse). Behind the corona is a deep fossa (fossa glandis, cervix), bounded by a circular fold of integument, the prceputium, which, in the quiescent state of the organ, may be drawn over the glans, but, in its distended state, is obliterated, and serves to facilitate its enlargement. The internal surface of the prepuce is lined by mucous membrane, covered by a thin epithelium; this membrane, on reaching the base of the glans, is reflected over the glans penis, and, at the meatus urinarius, is continuous with the mucous lining of the urethra. The sup)erficial fascia of the penis is thin, and its cellular struc- ture free from fat; it is continuous with the superficial fascia of the abdomen above, and with the dartos and superficial fascia of the perineum below. The ligamentum suspensorium penis is a strong fibrous meinbrane of triangular form, attached by its apex to the symphysis pubis ; and by its base, to the body of the penis. Near its attachment it separates into two layers, between which the dorsal vessels and nerves take their course. The penis is composed of the corpus cavernosum and corpus spon- giosum, and contains in its interior the longest portion of the urethra. The Corpus cavernosum is distinguished into two lateral portions (corpora cavernosa) by an imperfect septum and a superior and in- ferior groove; and is'divided posteriorly into two crura. It is firmly adherent, by means of its crura, to the rami of the pubes and ischium; and each crus previously to its junction with its fellow presents a slight enlargement, which has been named by Kobelt, the hulb. The corpus cavernosum forms, anteriorly, a single rounded extremity, which is received into a fossa in the base of the glans ; the superior groove lodges the dorsal vessels of the penis, and the inferior receives the corpus spongiosum. Its fibrous tunic is thick,647 COKPUS SPONGIOSUM PENIS. elastic, and extremely firm, and sends a number of fibrous bands and cords (trabeculae) inwards from its inferior groove, which cross its interior in a radiating direction, and are inserted into the inner walls of the tunic. These trabeculse are most abundant on the middle line, where they are ranged vertically, side by side, some- what like the teeth of a comb, and constitute the imperfect parti- tion of the corpus cavernosum, called septum pectiniforme. The septum is more complete at its posterior than towards its anterior part. The tunic of the corpus cavernosum consists of strong longitudinal fibrous fasciculi, closely interwoven with each other. Its internal structure is composed of erectile tissue. The Corpus spongiosum is situated along the under surface of the corpus cavernosum, in its inferior groove. It commences by its pos- terior extremity between and beneath the crura penis, where it forms a considerable enlargement, the hulh, and terminates anteriorly by another expansion, the glans penis. Its middle portion, or body, is nearly cylindrical, and tapers gradually from its posterior towards its anterior extremity. The bulb is adherent to the triangular liga- ment by means of a prolongation of fibrous membrane; in the rest of its extent the corpus spongiosum is attached to the corpus caVernosum by cellular tissue, and by veins which wind around that body to reach the dorsal vein. It is composed of erectile tissue, enclosed by a dense fibrous layer much thinner than that of the corpus cavernosum, and contains in its interior the spongy portion of the urethra, which lies nearer its upper than its lower wall. The bulb exhibits a tendency to division into two lobes, an appearance which is due to the existence of a thin longitudinal septum in its internal structure. Erectile tissue is a peculiar cellulo-vascular structure, entering in considerable proportion into the composition of the organs of genera- tion. It consists essentially of a plexus of veins so closely convoluted and interwoven with each other, as to give rise to a cellular appear- ance when examined by means of a section. The veins forming this plexus are smaller in the glans penis, corpus spongiosum, and circum- ference of the corpus cavernosum, than in the central part of the latter, where they are large and dilated. They have no other coat than the internal lining prolonged from the neighbouring veins; and the interstices of the plexus are occupied by a peculiar reddish fibrous tissue. They receive their blood froiji the capillaries of the arteries in the same manner as veins in general, and not by means of vessels having a peculiar form and distribution, as described by Miiller. The helicine arteries of that physiologist have no existence. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the penis are derived from the internal pudic; they are, the arteries of the bulb, arteries of the corpus cavernosum, and dorsales penis. Its veins are superficial and deep. The deep veins run by the side of the deep arteries, and terminate in the internal pudic veins. The superficial veins escapeURETHRA. 648 in considerable number from the base of the glans, and converge on the dorsum penis, to form a large dorsal vein, which receives other veins from the corpus cavernosum and spongiosum in its course, and passes backwards between two layers of the ligamentum suspensorium, and through the triangular ligament beneath the arch of the pubes, to terminate in the prostatic plexus. The Lymphatics terminate in the inguinal glands. The nerves are derived from the pudic nerve, sacral plexus, and hypogastric plexus. URETHRA. The urethra is the membranous canal extending from the neck of the bladder to the.meatus urinarius. It is curved in its course, and composed of two layers, a mucous coat and an elastic fibrous coat. The mucous coat is thin and smooth; it is continuous, in- Fig. 226.* * A longituditial section of the bladder, prostate gland, and penis, showing the urethra. 1.

The elastic fibrous coat varies in thickness in the different parts of the course of the urethra : it is thick in the prostate gland, forms a firm in- vestment for the membranous portion of the canal, and is thin in the spongy portion, where it serves as a bond of connexion between the mucous membrane and the corpus spongiosum. The urethra is about eight inches in length, and is divided into a prostatic, mem- branous, and spongy portion. The Prostatic portion, a little more than an inch in length, is situated in the prostate gland, about one-third nearer its upper than its lower surface, and extending from its base to its apex. Upon its lower circumference or floor is a longitudinal ridge or crest, the veru montanum, or caput gallinaginis, and on each side of the veru, a depressed fossa, the prostatic sinus, in which are seen the numerous openings (15 to 20) of the prostatic ducts. The veru montanum is most prominent in the centre ; and im- mediately in front of the prominent part is the opening of a small C89cal sac, the sinus pocularis, or utriculus prostaticus. This sac is the analogue of the uterus; it is nearly half an inch in length, and extends back beneath the third lobe of the prostate. It causes, by its approach to the surface, the prominence of the veru montanum, and is composed of two coats, mucous and fibrous. The fibrous coat is thick, and contains on each side the ejaculatory duct. The mucous coat is provided with an abundance of muciparous glands. The ejaculatory ducts terminate on each side within the aperture of the sinus pocularis by slit-like openings. The prostatic portion of the urethra, when distended, is the most dilated part of the canal; but, excepting during the passage of urine, is completely closed by means of a ring of muscular tissue which encircles the urethra as far as the anterior extremity of the veru montanum. In the contracted state of the urethra, the veru montanum acts as a valve, being pressed upwards against the roof deferens is seen to be cut short off, close to its junction with the ejaculatory duct. 10.

The Bfembranous portion, the narrowest part of the canal, mea- sures about three lines in dia- meter, and is somewhat less than an inch in length. It extends from the apex of the prostate gland to the bulb of the corpus spongiosum, and passes through the triangular ligament. Its coats are the mu- cous membrane, elastic fibrous tissue, and compressor urethrse muscle. The submucous tissue is richly supplied with vessels. The spongy portion, about six inches in length, forms the rest of the extent of the canal, and is lodged in the corpus spongiosum from its commencement at the triangular ligament to the meatus urinarius. It is narrowest in the body, and becomes dilated at each extremity, posteriorly in the bulb, where it is named the bulbous por- tion, and anteriorly in the glans penis, where it forms the fossa navi- cularis. The meatus urinarius is the most constricted part of the canal; so that a catheter, which will enterthat opening, may be passed freely through the whole extent of a normal urethra. Opening into the bulbous portion are two small excretory ducts about an inch in length, which may be traced backwards, between the coats of the urethra and the bulb, to the under part of the membranous portion * The bulbous, membranous, and prostatic urethra, with part oi the bladder. 1.

These are Gowper's glands; they are situated immediately beneath the membranous portion of the urethra, and are enclosed by the lower segment of the compressor urethrse muscle, so as to be subject to muscular compression. Upon the whole of the internal surface of the spongy portion of the urethra, and especially along its lower surface, are numerous small openings of lacunas, which are the apertures of mucous glands situated in the submucous cellular tissue. The openings of these lacunse are directed forwards, and are liable occasionally to intercept the point of a small catheter in its passage into the bladder. At about an inch and a half from the opening of the meatus, in the upper wall of the urethra, one of the lacunse is generally found much larger than the rest, and is named the lacuna magna. In a preparation of this lacuna, made by Sir Astley Cooper, the extremity of the canal presents several large primary ramifications. TESTES. ' The testes are two small glandular organs suspended from the abdomen by the spermatic cords, and enclosed in an external tegu- mentary covering, the scrotum. . The Scrotum is distinguished into two lateral halves or hemi- spheres by a rajohe, which is continued anteriorly along the under surface of the penis, and posteriorly along the middle line of the perineum to the anus. Of these two lateral portions the left is some- what longer than the right, and corresponds with the greater length of the spermatic cord on the left side. The scrotum is composed of two layers, the integument and a proper covering, the dartos ; the integument is extremely thin, transparent, and abundant, and beset by a number of hairs, which issue obliquely from the skin, and have prominent roots. The dartos is a thin layer of contractile fibrous tissue, intermediate in properties between muscular fibre and elastic tissue; it forms the proper tunic of the scrotum, and sends inwards a septum (septum scroti), which divides it into two cavities for the two testes. The dartos is continuous around the base of the scrotiim with the com- mon superficial fascia of the abdomen and perineum. The Spermatic cord is the medium of communication between the testes and the interior of the abdomen; it is composed of arte- ries, veins, lymphatics, nerves, the excretory duct of the testicle, and investing tunics. It commences at the internal abdominal ring, where the vessels of which it is composed converge, and passes obliquely along the spermatic canal : the cord then escapes at the external abdominal ring, and descends through the scrotum to the posterior border of the testicle. The left cord is somewhat longerANATOMY OF THE TESTIS. 652 than the right, and permits the left testicle to reach a lower level than its fellow. The Arteries of the spermatic cord are, the spermatic artery from the aorta ; the deferential artery, accompanying the vas deferens, from the superior vesical ; and the cremasteric branch from the epigastric artery. The spermatic veins form a plexus, which consti- tutes the chief bulk of the cord; they are provided with valves at short intervals, and the smaller veins have a peculiar tendril-like arrangement, which has obtained for them the name of vasa pam- piniformia. The lymphatics are of large size,*and terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are the spermatic plexus, which is de- rived from the aortic and renal plexus, the genital branch of the genito-crural nerve, and the scrotal branch of the ilio-inguinal. The Vas deferens, the excretory duct of the testicle, is situated along the posterior border of the cord, where it may be distin- guished by the hard and cordy sensation which it communicates to the fingers. Its parietes are very thick and tough, and its canal extremely small, and lined by the mucous membrane continued from the urethra. The Coverings of the spermatic cord are, the spermatic fascia, cremaster muscle, and fascia propria. The spermatic fascia is a prolongation of the intercolumnar fascia, derived from the borders of the external abdominal ring during the descent of the testicle in the foetus. The cremasteric covering (erythroid) is the thin mus- cular expansion formed by the spreading out of the fibres of the cremaster, which is likewise carried down by the testis during its descent. The fascia propria is a continuation of the infundibuliform process from the transversalis fascia, which immediately invests the vessels of the cord, and is also obtained during the ^ descent of the testis. The Testis (testicle) is a small oblong and rounded gland, about an inch and a half in length, somewhat compressed on the sides and behind, and suspended in the cavity of the scrotum by the spermatic cord. Its position in the scrotum is oblique, so that the upper ex- tremity is directed upwa-rds and forwards, and a little outwards; the lower, downwards and backwards, and a little inwards ; the convex border looks forwards and downwards, and the flattened border, to which the cord is attached, backwards and upwards. Lying against its outer and posterior border is a flattened body which follows the course of the testicle, and extends from its upper to its lower extremity; this body is named, from its relation to the testis, epididymis {Ittl, upon, diSv/jLog, the testicle); it is divided into a central part or body, an upper extremity or globus major, and a lower extremity, globus minor (cauda) epididymis. The globus major is situated against the upper end of the testicle, to which itEPIDIDYMIS. 653 The testis is invested by Fig. 228.- is closely adherent; the globus minor is placed at its lower end, is attached to the testis by cellular tissue, and curves upwards, to become continuous with the vas deferens, three tunics, tunica vaginalis, tunica albuginea, and tunica vasculosa, and is connected to the inner sur- face of the dartos by a large quan- tity of extremely loose cellular tissue, in which fat Jis never de- posited, but which is very suscep- tible of serous infiltration. The Tunica vaginalis is a pouch of serous membrane derived from the peritoneum in the descent of the testis, and afterwards obliter- ated from the abdomen to within a short distance of the gland. Like other serous coverings, it is a shut sac, investing the organ, and thence reflected so as to form a bag around its circumference: hence it is divided into the tunica vaginalis proioria and tunica va- ginalis reflexa. The tunica vaginalis propria covers the surface of the tunica albuginea, and surrounds the epididymis, connecting it to the testis by means of a distinct duplicature. The tunica vagi- iialis reflexa is attached by its external surface, through the me- dium of a quantity of loose cellular tissue, to the inner surface of the dartos. Between the two layers is the smooth surface of the shut sac, moistened by its proper secretion. The Tunica albuginea (dura mater testis) is a thick fibrous mem- brane, of a bluish white colour, and the proper tunic of the testicle. It is adherent externally to the tunica vaginalis propria, and, from the union of a serous with a fibrous membrane, is considered to be a fibro-serous membrane, like the dura mater and pericardium. After surrounding the testicle, the tunica albuginea is reflected from its posterior border into the interior of the gland, and forms a projecting longitudinal ridge, which is called the mediastinum testis (corpus * A transverse section of the testicle. 1.

Higlimorianum*), from which numerous fibrous cords (trabeculse, septula) are given ofi, to be inserted into the inner surface of the tunic. The mediastinum serves to contain the vessels and ducts of the testicle in their passage into the substance of the organ, and the fibrous cords are admirably fitted to prevent compression of the gland. If a transverse section be made of the testis, and the surface of the mediastinum examined, it will be ob- served that the blood-vessels of the substance of the organ are situated near the posterior border of the mediastinum, while the divided ducts of the rete testis occupy a ^lace nearer the free margin. The Tunica vasculosa (pia mater testis) is the nutrient mem- brane of the testis; it is situated immediately within the tunica albuginea, and encloses the substance of the gland, sending pro- cesses inwards between the lobules, in the same manner that the pia mater is reflected between the convolutions of the brain. The substance of the testis consists of numerous conical flattened lohules (lobuli testis), the bases being directed towards the surface of the organ, and the apices towards the mediastinum. Krause found between four and five hundred of these lobules in a single testis. Each lobule is invested by a distinct sheath formed of two layers, one being derived from the tunica vasculosa, the other from the tunica albuginea. The lobule is composed of one or several minute tubuli, tubuli seniiniferi,'Y exceedingly convoluted, anastomosing frequently with each other near their extremities, terminating in loops or in free csecal ends, and of the same diameter {yj-^ of an inch, Lauth) throughout. The tubuli seminiferi are of a bright yellow colour; they become less convoluted in the apices of the lobules, and termi- nate by forming between twenty and thirty small straight ducts of about twice the diameter of the tubuli seminiferi, the vasa recta. The vasa recta enter the substance of the mediastinum, and termi- nate in from seven to thirteen ducts, smaller in diameter than the vasa recta. These ducts pursue a waving course from below up- wards through the fibrous tissue of the mediastinum ; they commu- nicate freely with each other, and constitute the rete testis. At the upper extremity of the mediastinum, the ducts of the rete testis ter- minate in from nine to thirty small ducts, the vasa efferentia^X which form by their convolutions a series of conical masses, the coni vasculosi; from the bases of these cones tubes of larger size proceed, * Nathaniel Higkmore, a physician of Oxford, in his "Corporis Humani Disquisitio Anatomica," pubHshed in 1651, considers the corpus High- morianiun as a duct formed by the convergence of the fibrous cords, which he mistakes for smaller ducts. t Lauth estimates the whole number of tubuli seminiferi in each testis at 840, and their average length at 2 feet 3 inches. According to this calcula- tion, the whole length of the tubuli semijiiferi would be 1890 feet. X Each vas elferens with its cone measures, according to Lauth, about 8 inches. The entire length of the tubes composing the epididymis, according to the same authority, is about 21 feet.VAS DEFERENS. 655 which constitute, by their complex convolutions, the body of the epididymis. The tubes become gradually larger towards the lower end of the epididymis, and ter- minate in a single large and con- voluted duct, the vas deferens. The Ejndidymis is formed by the convolutions of the excretory seminal ducts, externally to the testis, and previously' to their ter- mination in the vas deferens. The more numerous convolutions and the aggregation of the coni vasculosi at the upper end of the organ constitute the globus major; the continuation of the convolu- tions downwards is the body; and the smaller number of convolutions of the single tube atthelower extre- mity, the globus minor. The tubuli are connected together by a very delicate cellular tissue, and are enclosed by the tunica vaginalis. A small convoluted duct, of variable length, is generally con- nected with the duct of the epidi- dymis immediately before the com- niencement of the vas deferens. This is the vasculum aberrans of Haller ; it is attached to the epididymis by the cellular tissue in which that body is enveloped. Sometimes it becomes dilated to- wards its extremity, but more frequently retains the same diameter throughout. The Fas deferens may be traced upwards, from the globus minor of the epididymis along the posterior part of the spermatic cord, and along the spermatic canal to the internal abdominal ring. From the ring it is reflected inwards to the side of the fundus of the bladder, and descends along its posterior surface, crossing the direc- tion of the ureter, to the inner border of the vesicula seminalis. In this situation it becomes somewhat larger in size and sacculated, and terminates at the base of the prostate gland, by uniting with the duct of the vesicula seminalis and constituting the ejaculatory duct.

FEMALE PELVIS. The peculiarities in form of the female pelvis have already been examined with the anatomy of the bones (p. 99). Its lining boun- daries are the same as those of the male. The contents are, the bladder, vagina, uterus with its appendages, and rectum. Some Fig. 230.* * A side view of the viscera of the female pelvis. 1.

The Bladder is in relation with the pubes in front, with the uterus behind, from which it is usually separated by a convolution of small intestine, and with the neck of the uterus and vagina be- neath. The form of the female bladder corresponds with that of the pelvis, being broad from side to side, and often bulging more on one side than on the other. This is particularly evident after frequent parturition. The coats of the bladder are the same as those of the male. The Urethra, about an inch and a half in length, is lodged in the upper and anterior wall of the vagina, in its course downwards and forwards, beneath the arch of the pubes, to the meatus urinarius. It is lined by mucous membrane, disposed in longitudinal folds, and is continuous internally with that of the bladder, and externally with that of the vulva; the mucous membrane is surrounded by a proper coat of elastic tissue, to which the muscular fibres of the de- trusor urinse are attached, by a plexus of blood-vessels and by the fibres of the compressor urethrse. It is to the elastic tissue that is due the remarkable dilatability of the female urethra, and its speedy return to its original diameter. The meatus is encircled by a ring of fibrous tissue, which prevents it from distending with the same facility as the rest of the canal; hence it is sometimes advan- tageous, in performing this operation, to divide the margin of the meatus with the knife. VAGINA. The Vagina is a membranous canal, leading from the vulva to the uterus, and corresponding in direction with the axis of the outlet of the pelvis. It is constricted at its commencement, but near the uterus becomes dilated, and is closed by the contact of the anterior with the posterior wall. Its length is variable; but it is always longer upon the posterior than upon the anterior wall, the former being usually about five or six inches in length, and the latter four or five. It is attached to the cervix of the uterus, which latter projects into the upper extremity of the canal. In structure the vagina is composed of a mucous lining, a layer of erectile tissue, and an external tunic of contractile fibrous tissue, resembling the dartos of the scrotum.

On each side it gives attachment, superiorly, to the broad ligaments of the uterus; and, inferiorly, to the pelvic fascia and levatores ani. The Mucous membrane presents a number of transverse papillae or ruga; upon the upper and lower surfaces of the canal, the rug^ extending outwards on each side from a middle raphe. The trans- verse papillge and raphe are more apparent upon the upper than upon the lower surface, and the two raphe are called the columns of the vagina. The mucous membrane is covered by a thin cuticular epithelium, which is continued from the labia, and terminates by a fringed border at about the middle of the cervix uteri. The Middle or erectile layer consists of erectile tissue enclosed between two layers of fibrous membrane; this layer is thickest near the commencement of the vagina, and becomes gradually thinner as it approaches the uterus. The External, or dartoid layer of the vagina, serves to connect it to surrounding viscera. Thus, it is very closely adherent to the under surface of the bladder, and drags that organ down with it in prolapsus uteri. To the rectum it is less closely connected, and that intestine is therefore less frequently affected in prolapsus. UTERUS. The Uterus is a flattened organ of a pyriform shape, having the base directed upwards and forwards, and the apex downwards and backwards in the line of the axis of the inlet of the pelvis, and form- ing a considerable angle with the course of the vagina. It is convex on its posterior surface, and somewhat flattened upon its anterior aspect. In the unimpregnated state it is about three inches in length, two in breadth across its broadest part, and one in thickness; and is divisible into fundus, body, cervix, and os uteri. At the period of puberty the uterus weighs about one ounce and a half; after parturi- tion from two to three ounces; and at the ninth month of utero- gestation from two to four pounds. The Fundus and hody are enclosed in a duplicature of peritoneum, which is connected with the sides of the pelvis, and forms a trans- verse septum between the bladder and rectum. The folds formed by this duplicature of peritoneum on either side of the organ are the broad ligaments of the uterus. The cervix is the lowest portion of the organ; it is distinguished from the body by a well-marked con- striction ; around its circumference is attached the upper end of the vagina, and at its extremity is an opening which is nearly round in the virgin, and transverse after parturition, the os uteri (os tineas), bounded before and behind by two labia; the anterior labium being the most thick, and the posterior somewhat the longer. The openingARBOR VIT^ UTERINA. 659 of the OS uteri is of considerable size, and is named the orificium uteri externum; the canal then becomes narrowed, and at the upper end of the cervix is constricted into a smaller opening, the orificium internum.* At this point the canal of the cervix expands into the shallow triangular cavity of the uterus, the inferior angle correspond- ing with the orificium internum, and the two superior angles, which are funnel-shaped and represent the original bicornute condition of the organ, with the commencement of the Fallopian tubes. In the canal of the cervix uteri are two longitudinal folds, anterior and posterior, to which numerous oblique folds converge, so as to give Fig. 231.t the idea of branches from the stem of a tree; hence this appearance has been denominated the arbor vitce uterina. Between these folds, and around the os uteri, are numerous mucous follicles. It is the closure of the mouth of one of these follicles, and the subsequent dis- tention of the follicle with its proper secretion, that occasions those vesicular appearances, so often noticed within the mouth and cervix of the uterus, called the ovula of Naboth. * The orificium internum is not unfrequently obliterated in old persons. Indeed, this obliteration is so common, as to have induced Mayer to regard it as normal. t The uterus with its appendages viewed on their anterior aspect. 1. The body of the uterus. 2. Its fundus. 3.

In the unimpregnated state the muscular coat is exceedingly condensed in texture, offers resistance to section with the scalpel, and appears to be composed of whitish fibres inextricably interlaced and mingled with blood-vessels. In the impregnated uterus the fibres are of large size, distinct, and disposed in two layers, superficial and deep. The super- ficial layer consists of fibres which pursue a vertical direction, some being longitudinal, and others oblique. The longitudinal fibres are found principally on the middle line, forming a thin plane upon the anterior and posterior face and fundus of the organ. The oblique fibres occupy chiefly the sides and the fundus. At the angles of the uterus the fibres of the superficial layer are continued outwards upon the Fallopian tubes, and into the round ligaments and ligaments of the ovaries. The deep layer consists of two hollow cones of circular fibres having their apex at the openings of the Fallopian tubes, and intermingling with each other by their bases on the body of the organ. These fibres are continuous with the deep muscular layer of the Fallopian tubes, and indicate the primitive formation of the uterus by the blending of these two canals. Around the cervix uteri the muscular fibres assume a circular form, interlacing with and crossing each other at acute angles. The mucous memhrane presents on its surface numerous minute apertures corresponding with mucous glands, and is provided with a columnar ciliated epithelium, which extends from the middle of the cervix uteri to the extremities of the Fallopian tubes. Yessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the uterus are the uterine from the internal iliac, and the ovarian from the aorta. The veins are large and remarkable; in the impregnated uterus they are called sinuses, and consist of canals channeled through the substance of the organ, being merely lined by the internal membrane of the veins. They terminate on each side of the uterus in the uterine plexuses. The lymphatics terminate in the lumbar glands. The Nerves of the uterus are derived from the hypogastric and spermatic plexuses, and from the sacral plexus. They have been made the subject of special investigation by Dr. Robert Lee, who has successfully repaired the omission made by Dr. William Hunter, in this part of the anatomy of the organ. In his numerous dissections of the uterus, both in the unimpregnated and gravid state, Dr. Lee has made the discovery of several large nervous ganglia and plexuses. The principal of these, situated on each side of the cervix uteri immediately behind the ureter, he terms the hypogastric ganglion; it receives the greater number of the nerves from the hypogastric and661 FALLOPIAN TUBES. sacral plexus, and distributes branches to tlie uterus, vagina, bladder, and rectum. Of the branches to the uterus, a large fasciculus pro- ceeds upwards by the side of the organ towards its angle, where they communicate with branches of the spermatic plexus, and form another large ganglion, which he designates the spermatic ganglion, and which supplies the fundus uteri. Besides these, Dr. Lee describes vesical and vaginal ganglia, and anterior and posterior subperitoneal ganglia and plexuses, which communicate with the preceding, and constitute an extensive nervous network over the entire uterus. Dr. Lee concludes his observations by remarking :—" These dissec- tions prove that the human uterus possesses a great system of nerves, which enlarges with the coats, blood-vessels, and absorbents, during pregnancy, and which returns after parturition to its original con- dition before conception takes place. It is chiefly by the influence of these nerves that the uterus performs the varied functions of menstruation, conception, and parturition, and it is solely by their means that the whole fabric of the nervous system sympathises with the different morbid affections of the uterus. If these nerves of the uterus could not be demonstrated, its physiology and pathology would be completely inexplicable."* ' APPENBAaES OP THE UTERUS. The Appendages of the uterus are enclosed by the lateral dupli- catures of peritoneum, called the broad ligaments. They are the Fallopian tubes and ovaries. The FALLOPIAN+ TUBES or oviducts, the uterine trumpets of the French writers, are situated in the upper border of the broad liga- ments, and are connected with the superior angles of the uterus. They are somewhat trumpet-shaped, being smaller at the uterine than at the free extremity, and narrower in the middle than at either end. Each tube is about four or five inches in length, and more or less flexuous in its course. The canal of the Fallopian tube is exceedingly minute ; its inner extremity opens by means of the ostium uterinum into the upper angle of the cavity of the uterus, and the opposite end into the cavity of the peritoneum. The free or expanded extremity of the Fallopian tube presents a double and sometimes a triple series of small processes or fringes, which sur- round the margin of the trumpet or funnel-shaped opening, the ostium abdominale. This fringe-like appendage to the end of the tube has gained for it the appellation of the fimbriated extremity; and the remarkable manner in which this circular fringe applies * Philosophical Transactions for 1842. t G-abriel FaUopius, a nobleman of Modena, was one of the founders of modern anatomy. He was Professor at Ferrara, then at Pisa, and afterwards succeeded Vesalius at Padua. His principal observations are collected in a work, " Observationes Anatomicse," which he published in 1561.OVARIES—CORPUS LUTEUM. 662 itself to the surface of the ovary during sexual excitement, the ad- ditional title of morsus diaboli. A short ligamentous cord pro- ceeds from the fimbriated extremity to be attached to the distal end of the ovary, and serves to guide the tube in its seizure of that organ. The Fallopian tube is composed of three tunics, an external and loose investment derived from the peritoneum; a middle or mus- cular coat, consisting of circular (internal) and longitudinal (ex- ternal) fibres, continuous with those of the uterus ; and an internal or lining mucous membrane, which is continuous on the one hand with the mucous membrane of the uterus, and at the opposite extremity with the peritoneum. In the minute canal of the tube the mucous -ynembrane is thrown into longitudinal folds or rugge, which indicate the adaptation of the tube for dilatation. The Ovaries (testes muliebres) are two oblong flattened and oval bodies, of a whitish colour and uneven surface, situated in the posterior layer of peritoneum of the broad ligaments. They are connected to the upper angles of the uterus at each side by means of a rounded cord, consisting of fibrous tissue, and a few muscular fibres derived from the uterus, the ligament of the ovary. By the opposite extremity they are connected by another and a shorter liga- ment to the fimbriated aperture of the Fallopian tube. In structure the ovary is composed of a cellulo-fibrous parenchyma or stroma, traversed by blood-vessels, and enclosed in a capsule con- sisting of three layers ; a vascular layer, which is situated most internally, and sends processes inwards to the interior of the organ; a middle or fibrous layer (tunica albuginea) of considerable density ; and an external investment of peritoneum. In the cells of the stroma of the ovary the small vesicles or ovisacs of the future ova, the Graafian vesicles are developed. There are usually about fifteen fully formed Graafian vesicles in each ovary; and Dr. Martin Barry has shown that countless numbers of microscopic ovisacs exist in the parenchyma of the organ, but that very few are perfected so as to produce ova. After conception, a yellow spot, the corpus luteum, is found in one or both ovaries. The corpus luteum is a globular mass of yellow, spongy tissue, traversed by white cellular bands, and con- taining in its centre a small cavity, more or less obliterated, which was originally occupied by the ovum. The interior of the cavity is lined by a puckered membrane, the remains of the ovisac. In recent corpora lutea, the opening by which the ovum escaped from the ovisac through the capsule of the ovary is distinctly visible ; when closed, a small cicatrix may be seen on the surface of the ovary in the situation of the openings A similar appearance to the preceding, but of smaller size, and without a central cavity, is some- times met with in the ovaries of the virgin ; this is a false corpus luteum. Vessels and Nerves.—The Arteries of the ovaries are branches ofMONS VENERIS—LABIA MAJORA. 663 the uterine ; the spermatic or ovarian artery being distributed to the broad ligaments and not specially to the ovaries, according to Weber. The veins form an ovarian plexus which terminates in the uterine plexus; the nerves are derived from the spermatic plexus. The Round ligaments are two muscular and fibrous cords be- tween four and five inches long, situated within the layers of the broad ligaments, and extending from the upper angles of the uterus, and along the spermatic canals to the labia majora, in which they are lost. They are accompanied by a small artery, by several fila- ments of the spermatic plexus of nerves, by a plexus of veins, and by a process of the peritoneum which represents the serous mem- brane investing the spermatic cord in the male. In the young sub- ject, this process extends for a short distance along the spermatic canal, and is denominated the canal of Nuck; it is sometimes per- vious in the adult. The plexus of veins occasionally becomes vari- cose, and forms a small tumour at the external abdominal ring, which has been mistaken for inguinal hernia. The round ligaments serve to retain the uterus in its proper position in the pelvis, and, during utero-gestation, to draw the anterior surface of the organ against the abdominal parietes. * external organs of generation. The female organs of generation are divisible into the internal and external: the internal are contained within the pelvis, and have been already described ; they are the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and Fallopian tubes. The external organs are the mons Veneris, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, meatus urinarius, and the opening of the vagina. The Mons Veneris is the eminence of integument, situated upon the front of the pubes. Its cellular tissue is loaded with adipose substance, and the surface covered with hairs. The Labia majora are two large longitudinal folds of integument, containing cellular tissue, fat, and a tissue resembling the dartos. They enclose an elliptical fissure, the common urino-sexual opening or vulva. The vulva receives the inferior opening of the urethra and vagina, and is bounded anteriorly by the commissura superior, and posteriorly by the commissura inferior. Stretching across the posterior commissure is a small transverse fold, the frcenulvm lahiorum or fourchette, which is ruptured during parturition; and immediately within this fold is a small cavity, the fossa navicu- laris. The length of the perinseum is measured from the posterior commissure to the margin of the anus, and is usually not more than an inch. The external surface of the labia is covered with hairs; the inner surface is smooth, and lined by mucous membrane, which contains a number of sebiparous follicles, and is covered by a thin cuticular epithelium. The use of the labia majora is to favour theCLITORIS—HYMEN. 664 extension of tlie vulva during parturition ; for, in the passage of the head of the fcetus, the labia are unfolded and completely effaced. The Labia minora, or nym'pTice, are two smaller folds, situated within the labia majora. Superiorly they are divided into two pro- cesses, which surround the glans clitoridis, the superior fold form- ing the praeputium clitoridis, the inferior its frsenulum. Inferiorly, they diminish gradually in size, and are lost on the sides of the opening of the vagina. The nymphse consist of mucous membrane, covered by a thin cuticular epithelium. They are provided with a number of mucous follicles, and contain, in their interior, a plexus of blood-vessels. The Clitoris is a small elongated organ situated in front of the pubes, and supported by a suspensory ligament. It is formed by a small body, which is analogous to the corpus cavernosum penis, and, like it, arises from the ramus of the os pubis and ischium on each side, by two crura. At the extremity of the clitoris is a small accumulation of erectile tissue which is highly sensitive, and is termed the glans. The corpus cavernosum clitoridis, like that of the penis, is composed of erectile tissue enclosed in a dense layer of fibrous membrane, and is susceptible of erection. Like the penis, also, it is provided with two small muscles, the erectores clitoridis. At about an inch behind the clitoris is the entrance of the vagina, an elliptical opening, marked by a prominent margin. The entrance to the vagina is closed in the virgin by a membrane of a semilunar form, which is stretched across the opening; this is the hymen. Sometimes the membrane forms a complete septum, and gives rise to great inconvenience by preventing the escape of the menstrual effusion. It is then called an imi^erforate hymen. The hymen must not be considered a necessary accompaniment of virginity, for its existence is very uncertain. When present, it assumes a variety of appearances: it may be a membranous fringe, with a round opening in the centre, or a semilunar fold, leaving an opening in front; or a transverse septum, having 'an opening both in front and behind ; or a vertical band with an opening at each side. The rupture of the hymen, or its rudimentary existence, gives rise to the appearance of a fringe of papillae around the opening of the vagina; these are called carunculce myrtiformes. The triangular smooth surface between the clitoris and the en- trance of the vagina, which is bounded on each side by the upper portions of the nymphse, is the vestibule. At the posterior part of the vestibule and near the margin of the vagina is the opening of the urethra, the meatus urinarius; and around the meatus an elevation of the mucous membrane formed by the aggregation of numerous mucous glands. This prominence serves as a guide to finding the meatus in the operation of intro- ducing the female catheter. Beneath the vestibule on each side, and extending from the clitoris to the side of the vagina, are two oblong or pyriform bodies, consisting of erectile tissue enclosed in a thinMAMMARY GLANDS. 665 layer of fibrous membrane. These bodies are narrow above (pars intermedia), broad and rounded below, and are termed by Kobelt, wbo considers tbem analogous to the bulb of the male urethra, the hulhi vestibuli. Behind these bodies and lying against the outer wall of the vagina are two small glands analogous to Cowper's glands in the male subject; these are the glands of Bartholine. Each gland opens by means of a long duct upon the inner side of the corresponding nympha. MAMMARY GLANDS. The Mammce are situated in the pectoral region, and are sepa- rated from the pectoralis major muscle by a thin layer of superficial fascia. They exist in the male as well as in the female, but in a rudimentary state, unless excited into growth by some peculiar action, such as the loss or atrophy of the testes. Their base is somewhat elliptical, the long diameter corresponding with the direction of the fibres of the pectoralis major muscle ; and the left mamma is generally a little larger than the right. Near the centre of the convexity of each mamma is a small pro- minence of the integument, called the nipple (mamilla), which is surrounded by an areola having a coloured tint. In females of fair complexion before impregnation, the colour of the areola is a delicate pink; after impregnation, it assumes a brownish hue, which deepens in colour as pregnancy advances ; and after the birth of a child, the brownish tint continues through life. The areola is furnished with a considerable number of sehiparous glands, which secrete a peculiar fatty substance for the protection of the delicate integument around the nipple. During suckling these glands are increased in size, and have the appearance of small pim- ples, projecting from the skin. At this period they serve by their increased secretion to defend the nipple and areola from the excori- ating action of the mouth of the infant. In structure, the mamma is a conglomerate gland, and consists of lobes, which are held together by a dense and firm cellular tissue ; the lobes are composed of lobules, and the lobules of minute csecal vesicles, the ultimate terminations of the excretory ducts. The excretory ducts (tubuli lactiferi, galactophori), from fifteen to twenty-five in number, commence by small openings at the apex of the nipple, and pass inwards, parallel with each other, towards the central part of the gland, where they form dilatations (ampullse), and give ofi" numerous branches to ramify through the gland to their ultimate terminations in the minute lobules. The ducts and csecal vesicles are lined, throughout, by a mucous membrane, which is continuous at the apex of the nipple with the integument. In the nipple the excretory ducts are surrounded by a tissue ana-666 MAMMARY GLANDS. logons to the dartos of tlie scrotum, to which the power of erectility of the nipple seems cine. There is no appearance of any structure resembling erectile tissue. Vessels and Nerves.—The mammae are supplied with arteries from the thoracic branches of the axillary, from the intercostals, and from the internal mammary. The veins form an incomplete circle around the base of the nipple (circulus venosus Halleri), from which larger veins conduct the blood to the circumference of the gland, and by these communications form a plexus on its surface. They termi- nate in the axillary vein, the internal mammary, the intercostals and the jugular veins. The Lymphatics take the course of the veins, inwards, to the an- terior mediastinal glands; and outwards along the border of the pectoralis major to the axillary glands. The Nerves of the mammary gland are derived from the anterior cutaneous branches of the third, fourth, and fifth intercostal nerves; and from the lateral cutaneous branches of the same nerves.667 CHAPTER XI. ANATOMY OF THE FCETUS. The medium weight of a child of the full period, at birth, is seven pounds, and its length seventeen inches; the extremes of weight are four pounds and three quarters, and ten pounds ; and the extremes of measurement fifteen and twenty inches. The head is of large size, and lengthened from before backwards ; the face small. The upper extremities are greatly developed, and the thorax expanded and full. The upper part of the abdomen is large, from the great size of the liver; the lovfer part is small and conical. And the lower extremities are very small in proportion to the rest of the body. The external genital organs are very large, and fully deve- loped, and the attachment of the umbilicus is one inch farther from the vertex of the head than from the soles of the feet; and one inch farther from the ensiform cartilage than from the symphysis pubis. Osseous system.—The development of the osseous system has been treated of in the first chapter. The ligamentous system pre- sents no peculiarity deserving of remark. Muscular system.—The muscles of the foetus at birth are large and fully formed. They are of a lighter colour than those of the adult, and of softer texture. The transverse striae on the fibres of animal life are not distinguishable until the sixth month of foetal life. Vascular system.—The circulating system presents several pe- culiarities : Istly, In the heart; there is a communication between the two auricles by means of the foramen ovale. 2ndly, In the arterial system ; there is a communication between the pulmonary artery and arch of the aorta, by means of a large trunk, the ductus arteriosus. 3rdly, Also in the arterial system : the internal iliac arteries, under the name of hypogastric and umbilical, are continued from the foetus to the placenta, to which they return the blood which has circulated in the system of the foetus. 4thly, In the venous system ; there is a communication between the umbilical vein and the inferior vena cava, called the ductus venosus. f(etal circulation. The pure blood is brought from the placenta by the umbilical vein. The umbilical vein passes through the umbilicus, and enters the liver, where it divides into several branches, which may be ar- ranged under three heads:—Istly, Two or three, which are distri-668 F(ETAL CmCITLATION.

In the inferior cava the pure blood becomes mixed with that which is retumj.ng from the lower extremities and abdominal viscera, and is carried through the right auricle (guided by the Eustachian valve) and through the foramen ovale, into the left auricle. From the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle, and from the left ventricle into the aorta, whence it is distributed by means of the carotid and subclavian ar- teries, principally to the head and upper extremities. From the head and upper extremities, the impure blood is returned by the superior vena cava to the right auricle ; from the right auricle, it is propelled into the right ventricle ; and from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. In the adult, the blood would now be cir- culated through the lungs, and oxygenated; but in the foetus the lungs are solid, and almost impervious. Only a small quantity of the blood passes therefore into the lungs ; the greater part courses through the ductus arteriosus, into the commencement of the de- scending aorta, where it becomes mingled with that portion of the pure blood which is not sent through the carotid and subclavian arteries. Passing along the aorta, a small quantity of this mixed blood is distributed by the external iliac arteries to the lower extremities; the greater portion is conveyed by the internal iliac, hypogastric, and umbilical arteries to the placenta; the hypogastric arteries pro- ceeding from the internal iliacs, and passing by the side of the fundus of the bladder, and upwards along the anterior wall of the abdomen to the umbilicus, where they become the umbilical arteries. From a careful consideration of this circulation, we perceive—1st. That the pure blood from the placenta is distributed in considerable quantity to the liver, before entering the general circulation. Hence arises the abundant nutrition of that organ, and its enormous size in comparison with other viscera. 2ndly. That the right auricle is the scene of meeting of a double current; the one coming from the inferior cava, the other from the superior, and that they must cross each other in their respective blood from the head and upper extremities through the jugular and subcla- vian veins, to the superior vena cava (14), to the right auricle (8), and in the course of the arrow through the right ventricle (15), to the pxilmonary artery (16). 17. The ductus arteriosus, which appears to be a proper continuation of the pulmonary artery, the offsets at each side are the right and left pul- monary artery cut off; these are of extremely small size as compared with the ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus joins the descending aorta (18, 18), which divides into the common ihacs, and these into the internal ihaes, which become the hypogastric arteries (19), and return the blood along the umbihcal cord to the placenta; while the other divisions, the external ihacs (20), are continued into the lower extremities. The arrows at the termina- tions of these vessels mark the return of the venous blood by the veins to the inferior cava.FCETAL CIRCULATION. 670 course. How this crossing is effected tlie theorist will wonder; not so the practical anatomist; for a cursory examination of the foetal heart will show-—1. That the direction of entrance of the two vessels is so opposite, that they may discharge their currents through the same cavity without admixture. 2. That the inferior cava opens almost directly into the left auricle. 3. That by the aid of the Eustachian valve, the current in the inferior cava will be almost entirely excluded from the right auricle. 3rdly. That the blood which circulates through the arch of the aorta comes directly from the placenta; and, although mixed with the impure blood of the inferior cava, yet is propelled in so great abundance to the head and upper extremities, as to provide for the increased nutrition of those important parts, and prepare them, by their greater size and development, for the functions which they are required to perform at the instant of birth. 4thly. That the blood circulating in the descending aorta is very impure, being obtained principally from the returning current in the superior cava; a small quantity only being derived from the left ven- tricle. Yet it is from this impure blood that the nutrition of the lower extremities is provided. Hence we are not surprised at their insignificant development at birth ; while we admire the providence of nature, which directs the nutrient current, in abundance, to the organs of sense, prehension, and deglutition, organs so necessary, even at the instant of birth, to the safety and welfare of the creature. After birth, the foramen ovale becomes gradually closed by a mem- branous layer, which is developed from the margin of the opening from below upwards, and completely separates the two auricles. The situation of the foramen is seen in the adult heart, upon the septum auricularum, and is called the fossa ovalis; the prominent margin of the opening is the annulus ovalis. As soon as the lungs have become inflated by the first act of inspi- ration, the blood of the pulmonary artery courses through its right and left branches into the lungs, to be returned to the left auricle by the pulmonary veins. Thus the pulmonary circulation is established. Then the ductiis arteriosus contracts and degenerates into an imper- vious fibrous cord, serving in after life simply as a bond of union between the left pulmonary artery and the concavity of the arch of the aorta. The current through the umbilical cord being arrested, the hypo- gastric arteries likewise contract and become impervious. The umbilical vein and ductus venosus, also deprived of their circulating current, become reduced to fibrous cords, the former being the round ligament of the liver, and the latter a fibrous band which may be traced along the fissure of the ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava. Nervous ststem.—The brain is very soft, almost pulpy, and has a reddish tint throughout; its weight at birth, relatively to the entire body, is as one to six, and the difference between the white and grey671 THYMUS GLAND. substance is imperfectly marked. The nerves are firm and well de- veloped. ORGANS OP SENSE. Eye.-—The eyeballs are of large size and well developed at birth. The pupil is closed by a vascular membrane called the membrana pupillaris, which disappears at about the seventh month. Sometimes it remains permanently, and produces blindness. It consists of two thin membranous layers, between which the ciliary arteries are pro- longed from the edge of the iris, and form arches and loops by return- ing to it again, without anastomosing with those of the opposite side. The removal of the membrane takes place by the contraction of these arches and loops towards the edge of the pupil. The capsule of the lens is extremely vascular. Ear.—The ear is remarkable for its early development; the laby- rinth and ossicula auditus are ossified at an early period, and the latter are completely formed before birth. The only parts remaining incomplete are the mastoid cells, and the meatus auditorius. The membrana tympani in the foetal head is very oblique, occupying almost the basilar surface of the skull; hence probably arises a deficient acuteness in the perception of sound. It is also extremely vajscular. Nose.—The sense of smell is imperfect in the infant, as may be in- ferred from the small capacity of the nasal fossae, and the non-deve- lopment of the ethmoid, sphenoid, frontal, and maxillary sinuses. THYROID GLAND. The Thyroid gland is of large size in the foetus, and is developed by two lateral halves, which approach and become connected at the middle line so as to constitute a single gland. It is doubtful whether it performs any special function in foetal life. THYMUS GLAND. The Thymus gland* consists " of a thoracic and a cervical portion on each side. The former is situated in the anterior mediastinum, and the latter is placed in the neck just above the first bone of the sternum and behind the sterno-hyoidei and sterno-thyroidei muscles." It extends upwards from the fourth rib as high as the thyroid gland, resting against the pericardium, and separated from the arch of the aorta and great vessels by the thoracic fascia in the chest, and lying on each side of the trachea in the neck. Although described usually as a single gland, it consists actually of two lateral, almost symmetrical glands, connected with each other * In the description of this gland I have adhered closely to the history of it given by Sir Astley Cooper, in his beautiful monograph " On the Anatomy of the Thymus Gland," 1832.THYMUS GLAND, 672 by cellular tissue only, and having no structural communication: they may therefore be " properly called, a right and left thymus gland." Between the second and third month of embryonic existence, the thymus is so small as to be only "just perceptible;" and continues gradually increasing with the growth of the foetus until the seventh. At the eighth month it is large; but, during the ninth, it undergoes a sudden change, assumes a greatly increased size, and at birth weighs 240 grains. After birth it continues to enlarge until the expiration of the first year, when it ceases to grow, and gradually diminishes, until at puberty it has almost disappeared. The thymus is a conglomerate gland, being composed of lobules disposed in a spiral form around a central cavity. The lobules are held together by a firm cellular tissue ("reticulated"), and the entire gland is enclosed in a coarse fibro-cellular capsule. mg. 233.* The Lobules are very numerous, and vary in size from that of the head of a pin to a moderate-sized pea. Each lobule contains in its interior a small cavity, or secretory cell,'''' and several of these cells open into a small pouch" which is situated at their base, and leads to the central cavity, the ^'■reservoir of the thymus." * A section of the thymus gland at the eighth month, showing its anatomy. This figure, and the succeeding, were drawn from two of Sir Astley Cooper's beautiful preparations, with the kind permission of their possessor. The references were made by Sir Astley's own hand. 1. The cervical portions of the gland; the independence of the two lateral glands is weU marked. 2. Secretory cells seen on the cut surface of the section; these are observed in aU parts of the section. 3, 3. The pores or openings of the secretory cells and pouches; they are seen dispersed upon the whole internal surface of the great central cavity or reservoir. The continuity of the reservoir in the lower or thoracic portion of the gland, with the cervical portion, is seen in the figure.673 THYMIC FLUID. Fig, 234, The Reservoir is lined in its interior by a vascular mucous mem- brane, wbich is raised into ridges by a layer of ligamentous bands situated beneath it. The liga- mentous bands proceed in various directions, and encircle the open mouths (pores) of the secretory cells and pouches. This liga- mentous layer serves to keep the lobules together and prevents the injurious distention of the cavity. When either gland is carefully unravelled by removing the fibro- cellular capsule and vessels, and dissecting away the reticulated cellular tissue which retains the lobules in contact, the reservoir, from being folded in a serpentine manner upon itself, admits of being drawn out into a lengthened tubular cord,f around which the lobules are clustered in a spiral planner, and resemble knots upon h, cord, or a string of beads. The reservoir, pouches, and cells, contain a white fluid *' like chyle," or ^' like cream, but vsdth a small admixture of red globules." In an examination of the thymic fluid which I lately (1840) made, with a Powell microscope magni- fying 600 times linear measure, I observed that the corpuscles were very numerous, smaller than the blood particles, globular and oval in form, irregular in outline, variable in size, and provided with a small central nucleus. In the human foetus this fluid has been found by Sir Astley Cooper in too small proportion to * The course and termination of the " absorbent duets" of the thymus of the calf; from one of Sir Astley Cooper's preparations. 1.

But tbe thymic fluid of the foetal calf, which exists in great abundance, gave the following analytical' results; one hundred parts of the fluid contained sixteen parts of solid matter, which consisted of,— Incipient fibrine, Albumen, Mucous, and muco-extractive matter, Muriate and phosphate of potass. Phosphate of soda. Phosphoric acid, a trace. According to the researches of Simonf and Oesterlen the thymus is composed of polygonal and mutually flattened membranous cells, measuring from half a line to two lines in diameter and arranged in conical masses around a central cavity. Each cell is surrounded by a capillary plexus and connected to neighbouring cells by cellular tissue intermingled with elastic fibres. The corpuscles found in the fluid of the thymus are dotted nuclei measuring -g-sW inch in diameter; and are subject to conversion into nucleated cells and fat- cells. The Arteries of the thymus gland are derived from the internal mammary, and from the superior and inferior thyroid. The Veins terminate in the left vena innominata, and some small branches in the thyroid veins. The Nerves are minute, and derived chiefly, through the internal mammary plexus, from the superior thoracic ganglion of the sym- pathetic. Sir Astley Cooper has also seen a branch from the junc- tion of the pneumogastric and sympathetic pass to the side of the gland. The Lymphatics terminate in tbe general union of the lymphatic vessels at the junction of the internal jugnilar and subclavian vein. Sir Astley Cooper has injected them only once in the human foetus, but in the calf he finds two large lymphatic ducts, which commence in the upper extremities of the glands, and pass downwards to ter- minate at the junction of the jugular and subclavian vein at each side. These vessels he considers to be the '' absorbent ducts of the glands ; ' thymic ducts they are the carriers of the fluid from the thymus into the veins," Sir Astley Cooper concludes his anatomical description of this gland with the following observations :— '' As the thymus secretes all the parts of the blood, viz., albumen, fibrine, and particles, is it not probable that the gland is designed to prepare a fluid well fitted for the foetal growth and nourishment from the blood of the mother, before the birth of the foetus, and, consequently, before chyle is formed from food ?—and this process This analysis was conducted by Dr. Dowler of Kichnaond. t " A Physiological Essay on the Thymus Gland," 4to. 1845.675 FCETAL LUNGS AND HEART. bontimies for a short time after birth, the quantity of fluid secreted from the thymus gradually declining as that of chylification becomes perfectly established." FOETAL LUNGS. The Lungs^ previously to the act of inspiration, are dense and solid in structure, and of a deep red colour. Their specific gravity is greater than water, in which they sink to the bottom ; whereas lung which has respired will float upon that fluid. The specific gravity is, however, no test of the real weight of the lung, the respired lung being actually heavier than the foetal. Thus the weight of the festal lung, at about the middle period of uterine life, is to the weight of the body as 1 to 60.* But, after respiration, the relative weight of the lung to the entire body is 1 to 30. FCETAL HEART. The Heart of the foetus is large in proportion to the size of the body; it is also developed very early, representing at first a simple vessel, and undergoing various degrees of complication until it arrives at the compound character which it presents after birth. The two ventricles form, at one period, a single cavity, which is afterwards divided into two by the septum ventriculorum. The two auricles communicate up to the moment of birth, the septum being incomplete, and leaving a large opening between them, the foramen ovale (foramen of Botalf). The Ductus arteriosus is another peculiarity of the foetus con- nected with the heart; it is a communication between the left pul- monary artery and the arch of the aorta. It degenerates into a fibrous cord after birth, from the double cause, of a diversion in the current of the blood towards the lungs, and from the pressure of the left bronchus, caused by its distention with air. VISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. At an early period of uterine life, and sometimes at the period of birth, as I have twice observed in the imperfectly developed foetus, two minute fibrous threads may be seen passing from the umbilicus to the mesentery. These are the remains of the omphalo-mesenteric vessels. The Omphalo-mesenteric are the first developed vessels of the germ : they ramify upon the vesicula umbilicalls, or yolk-bag, and supply the newly formed alimentary canal of the embryo. From them, as from a centre, the general circulating system is produced. * Cruveilliier, Anatomie Descriptive, vol. ii. p. 621. t Leonard Botal, of Piedmont, was the first of the moderns who gave an account of this opening, in a Avork published in 1565. His description is very imperfect. The foramen was well known to Galen. X X 2676 FOETAL LIVEE AND KIDNEYS. After the establishment of the placental circulation they cease to carry blood, and dwindle to the size of mere threads, which may be easily demonstrated in the early periods of uterine life; but are com- pletely removed, excepting under peculiar circumstances, at a later period. The Stomach is of small size, and the great extremity but little developed. It is also more vertical in direction the earlier it is examined, a position that would seem due to the enormous magni- tude of the liver, and particularly of its left lobe. The Appendix vermiformis cceci is long and of large size, and is continued directly from the central part of the cul-de-sac of the C93cum, of which it appears to be a constricted continuation. This is the character of the appendix cseci in the higher quadrumana. The large intestines are filled with a dark green viscous secretion, called meconium ([jiriKojv, poppy), from its resemblance to the inspis- sated juice of the poppy. The Pancreas is comparatively larger in the foetus than in the adult. The Spleen is comparatively smaller in the foetus than in the adult. F(ETAL LIVEK. The Liver is the first formed organ in the embryo. It is deve- loped from the alimentary canal, and at about the third week fills the whole abdomen, and is one half the weight of the entire embryo. At the fourth month the liver is of immense size in proportion to the bulk of the foetus. At birth, it is of very large size, and occu- pies the whole upper part of the abdomen. The left lobe is as large as the right, and the falciform ligament corresponds with the middle line of the body. The liver diminishes rapidly after birth, probably from obliteration of the umbilical vein. KIDNEYS AND SUPEA-RENAL CAPSULES. The Kidneys present a lobulated appearance in the foetus, which is their permanent type among some animals, as the bear, the otter, and cetacea. The Supra-renal capsules are organs which appear, from their early and considerable development, to belong especially to the economy of the foetus. They are distinctly formed at the second month of embryonic life, and are greater in size and weight than the kidneys. At the third or fourth month, they are equalled in bulk by the kidneys; and at birth are about one-third less than those organs. VISCEEA OP THE PELVIS. The Bladder in the foetus is long and conical, and situated altogether above the upper border of the ossa pubis, which are as yet small and undeveloped. It is, indeed, an abdominal viscus, and677 URACHUS—TESTES. is connected superiorly with a fibrous cord, called the umcJms, of which it appears to be an expansion. The Urachus is continued upwards to the umbilicus, and becomes connected with the umbilical cord. In animals it is a pervious duct, and is continuous with one of the membranes of the embryo, the allantois. It has been found pervious in the human foetus; and the urine has been known to pass through the umbilicus. Calcu- lous concretions have also been found in its course. The Uterus, in the early periods of embryonic existence, appears bifid, from the large size of the Fallopian tubes, and the small de- velopment of the body of the organ. At the end of the fourth month, the body assumes a larger bulk, and the bifid appearance is lost. The cervix uteri in the foetus is larger than the body of the organ. The Ovaries are situated, like the testicles, in the lumbar region, near the kidneys, and descend from thence, gradually, into the I)elvis. TESTES. The Testicles in the embryo are situated in the lumbar regions, immediately in front of and somewhat below the kidneys. They tave, connected with them inferiorly, a peculiar structure, which assists in their descent, and is called the gubernaculum testis. The Gubernaculum is a soft and conical cord, composed of cel- lular tissue, containing in its areolse a gelatiniform fluid. In the abdomen it lies in front of the psoas muscle, and passes along the spermatic canal, which it serves to distend for the passage of the testis. It is attached by its superior and larger extremity to the lower end of the testis and epididymis, and by the inferior extremity to the bottom of the scrotum. The gubernaculum is surrounded by a thin layer of muscular fibres, the cremaster, which pass upwards upon this body to be attached to the testis. Inferiorly the muscular fibres divide into three processes, which, according to Curliag,* are thus attached : '' The external and broadest is connected to Pou- part's ligament in the inguinal canal; the middle forms a lengthened band, which escapes at the external abdominal ring, and descends to the bottom of the scrotum, where it joins the dartos; the internal passes in the direction inwards, and has a firm attachment to the OS pubis and sheath of the rectus muscle. Besides these a number of muscular fibres are reflected from the internal oblique on the front of the gubernaculum." The Descent of the testicle is gradual and progressive. Between the fifth and sixth month it has reached the lower part of the psoas muscle, and during the seventh it makes its way through the sper- matic canal, and descends into the scrotum. * " On the Structure of the Grubernaculum," &c., by Mr. Curling, Lecturer on Morbid Anatomy in the London Hospital. Lancet, vol. ii. 1840-41, p. 70.DESCENT OP THE TESTES. 678 While situated in the lumbar region, tlie testis and gubemaculum are placed behind the peritoneum by which they are invested upon their anterior surface and sides. As they descend, the investing peritoneum is carried downwards with the testis into the scrotum, forming a lengthened pouch, which by its upper extremity opens into the cavity of the peritoneum. The upper part of this pouch, being compressed by the spermatic canal, is gradually obliterated, the obliteration extending downwards along the spermatic cord nearly to the testis. That portion of the peritoneum which imme- diately surrounds the testis is, by the above process, cut off from its continuity with the peritoneum, and is termed the tunica vaginalis ; and as this membrane must be obviously a shut sac, one portion of it investing the testis, and the other being reflected so as to form a loose bag around it, its tM'-o portions have received the ap- pellations of tunica vaginalis propria, and tunica vaginalis reflexa. Fig. 235.* Fig. 236.f The descent of the testis is effected by means of the traction of the muscle of the gubernaculum, the cremaster. " The fibres," writes Mr. Curling, ' * proceeding from Poupart's ligament, and the obliquus internus, tend to guide the gland into the inguinal canal; those at- tached to the OS pubis, to draw it below the abdominal ring; and the * A diagram illustrating the descent of the testis. 1.

During the descent, "the muscle of the testis is gradually everted, until, when the transition is completed, it forms a muscular envelope external to the process of peritoneum, which surrounds the gland and the front of the cord." " The mass composing the central part of the gubernaculum, which is so soft, lax, and yielding as in every way to facilitate these changes, becomes gradually diffused, and, after the arrival of the testicle in the scrotum, contributes to form the loose cellular tissue which afterwards exists so abundantly in this part." The attachment of the gubernaculum to the bottom of the scrotum is indicated throughout life by distinct traces.INDEX.

THE SAME WORK, i Illustrated with finely-executed Engravings on Steel, accurately coloured. Octavo. Clotli, 30s. " The work is very considerably improved in the present edition. Of the plates it is impossible to speak too highly. The representations of the various forms of cutaneous disease are singularly accurate, and the colouring exceeds almost any- thiag we have met with in point of deUcacy and finish."

" The student will be dehghted to find his labours so much facihtated j and a few hours of agreeable society with a most pleasantly-written book will do more to make him acquainted with a class of obscure diseases than all that has been pre- viously written on the subject."—Lancet,Works by Erasmus Wilson, F.E.S. III. POETEAITS OF DISEASES OF THE SKIN. Folio. Fasciculi I. to XI. Containing Four highly-finished Coloured Plates. 20s. each. "May be truly designated a splendid performance, surpassing, in the artistic beauty of its delineations, and fully equalling in their fidelity to nature, any thing which has yet been brought out in this country or on the continent. We can scarcely speak too strongly of the merits of this work," British and Foreign Medical Review, " We have never before seen a work more beautifully got up, both as regaxds the typography and the execution and colouring of the plates. Even AJibert's grand work sinks into the shade when placed by the side of that of Mr. Wilson's." Lancet. IV. ON SYPHILIS, CONSTITUTIONAL AND HEEEDITAEY; Unlj on SBpi)iUtic ^Eruptions.

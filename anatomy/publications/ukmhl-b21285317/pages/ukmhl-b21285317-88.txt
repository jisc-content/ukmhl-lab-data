GENERAL ANATOMY. lxxx Fig. XLIV.—Transverse section of the grey sub- stance of the spinal cord, near the middle of the dorsal region. Magnified 13 diameters. J. L. Clarke del. The grey substance of the cord occupies its central part in the shape of two crescentic horns, joined together by a commissure. Each of these crescents has an anterior and a posterior cornu. The posterior horn consists of two parts—the caput com it, or ex- panded extremity of the horn (tig. XLV.), round which is a lighter space or lamina, of gelatinous substance; and the cervix cornu, or narrower portion, which con- nects it with the rest of the grey substance. The gelatinous substance is a peculiar accumulation of neu- roglia (Klein), and has been named by Rolando the substantia cmerea gelatinosa. The anterior horn of the grey substance in the cervical and lumbar swellings, where it gives origin to the nerves of the extremities, is much larger than in any other region, and contains several distinct groups of large and variously shaped cells. The grey commissure is situated behind the white commissure, which Fig. XLV.—Transverse section of the grey substance of the spinal cord through the middle of the lumbar enlargement.

775 THE FASCIA LATA. forms a uniform investment for the whole of this region of the limb. At the upper aird inner part of the thigh, a large oval-shaped aperture is observed in it j it transmits the internal saphenous vein and other small vessels, and is called the saphenous opening. In order the more correctly to consider the mode of formation of this aperture, the fascia lata in this part of the thigh is described as consisting of two portions, an iliac portion and a pubic portion. The iliac portion of the fascia lata is situated on the outer side of the saphenous opening covering the outer surface of the Sartorius, the Rectus, and the Psoas and Iliacus muscles. It is attached externally to the crest of the ilium and its anterior superior spin1, to the whole length of Eoupart's ligament as far internally as the 443.â€”Femoral Hernia, showing Fascia Lata and Saphenous Opening. spine of the pubes, and to the pectineal line in conjunction with Gimbernat's liga- ment, where it becomes continuous with the pubic portion. From the spine of the pubes it is reflected downwards and outwards, forming an arched margin, the outer boundary (superior cornu) of the saphenous opening. This is sometimes called the falciform process of the fascia lata (femoral ligament of Hey); it overlies, and is adherent to, the sheath of the femoral vessels beneath; to its edge is attached the cribriform fascia, and it is continuous below with the pubic portion of the fascia lata by a well-defined curved margin.* * Mr. Gay (on Femoral Rupture, p. 13) describes the iliac portion of the fascia lata as advancing to the saphenous opening, then becoming abruptly reflected on itself, so as to form two layers, the inner or lower of which is continuous with the thin fascia repeatedly alluded to by Sir A. Cooper as spread out beneath it and in front of the sheath of the vessels. This deep layer of the iliac fascia is traversed by a band of ligamentous fibres lying immediately

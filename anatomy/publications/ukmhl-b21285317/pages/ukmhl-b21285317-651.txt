483 CONVOLUTIONS OF THE BRAIN. The convolutions on the outer convex surface of the hemisphere, the general direction of which is more or less oblique, are the largest and most complicated con- volutions of the brain, frequently becoming branched like the letter Y in their course upwards and backwards, towards the longitudinal fissure : these convolutions attain their greatest development in man, and are especially characteristic of the human brain. They are seldom symmetrical on the two sides. Each hemisphere of the brain on its external surface is divided into five lobes, the division being made by the main fissures and by imaginary lines drawn to connect them (fig. 269). The fissures dividing the five lobes on the external surface of the hemispheres are three in number, and are named : fissure of Sylvius, fissure of Rolando, and parieto- occipital fissure. 269.â€”Convolutions and Fissures of the Outer Surface of the Cerebral Hemisphere. The fissure of Sylvius begins at the base of the brain at the anterior perforated space, and passing outwards to the external surface of the hemisphere, divides into two; one branch, passing upwards towards the longitudinal fissure, may be termed the ascending limb; the other, the longer one, running nearly horizontally back- wards, may be called the horizontal limb. The fissure of Rolando is situated about the middle of the outer surface of the hemisphere. It commences at or near the longitudinal fissure and runs downwards and forwards to terminate a little above the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius. In its course it runs parallel to and some distance behind the ascending limb of the Sylvian fissure. The parietooccipital fissure is only seen to a slight extent on the outer surface of the hemisphere, and is not so distinctly marked as the others. The portion on the outer surface of the hemisphere is sometimes called the external parieto-occipital 1 1 2

ARTERIES. 392 one of which ramifies on its free surface, the other between it and the substance of the liver. The Splenic Artery, in the adult, is the largest of the three branches of the cceliac axis, and is remarkable for the extreme tortuosity of its course. It passes horizontally to the left side behind the upper border of the pancreas, accompanied by the splenic vein, which lies below it; and, on arriving near the spleen, divides 228.â€”The Cceliac Axis and its Branches, the Stomach having been raised, and the Transverse Mesocolon removed. into branches, some of which enter the hilum of that organ to be distributed to its structure, whilst others are distributed to the great end of the stomach. The branches of this vessel are : Pancreaticse parva?. Gastric (Vasa brevia). Rancreatica magna. Gastro-epiploica sinistra. The pancreatic are numerous small branches derived from the splenic as it runs behind the upper border of the pancreas, supplying its middle and left parts. One of these, larger than the rest, is given off from the splenic near the left extremity of the pancreas; it runs from left to right near the posterior surface of the gland, following the course of the pancreatic duct, and is called the pancreatica magna- These vessels anastomose with the pancreatic branches of the pancreatico-duodenal arteries, derived from the hepatic on the one hand and superior mesenteric on the other. The gastric (vasa brevia) consist of from five to seven small branches, which arise either from the termination of the splenic artery, or from its terminal

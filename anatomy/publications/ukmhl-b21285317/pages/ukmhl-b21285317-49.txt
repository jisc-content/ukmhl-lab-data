Trihedral crystals from blood of guinea-pig. B. Pentagonal crystals from blood of squirrel, c. Octahedral crys- tals from blood of rat and mouse. D. Haamatin crystals from human blood. E. Hiematoidin crystals from an old apoplectic clot. F. Hseuiin crystals from blood treated with acetic acid. their importance as a means of distinguishing human from other kinds of blood. They are of three kinds:-—1. Haematin crystals, found in normal blood, particularly in the spleen. These are procured by the addition of a little water, or by agitating the blood with ether, by either of which means the blood-corpuscles are ruptured, and their contents crystallise on evapo- ration. 2. Hsematoidin crystals found in old clots. 3. Haemin crystals, formed by mixing dried blood with an equal quantity of common salt and boiling it with a few drops of glacial acetic acid till the whole has dissolved. A drop of the mixture placed on the slide will show the crystals on cooling. Fig. IV. shows these three forms of crystals from human blood, together with some from the lower animals, for comparison.

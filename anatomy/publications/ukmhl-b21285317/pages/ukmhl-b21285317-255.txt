SCAPULA. S7 The posterior surface, or dorsum (fig. 85), is arched from above downwards, alternately concave and convex from side to side. It is subdivided unequally into two parts by the spine ; the portion above the spine is called the supraspinous fossa, and that below it the infraspinous fossa. The supraspinous fossa, the smaller of the two, is concave, smooth, and broader at the vertebral than at the humeral extremity. It affords attachment by its inner two-thirds to the Supraspinatus muscle. 84.â€”Left Scapula. Anterior Surface, or Venter. The infraspinous fossa is much larger than the preceding ; towards its vertebral margin a shallow concavity is seen at its upper part; its centre presents a promi- nent convexity, whilst towards the axillary border is a deep groove, which runs from the upper towards the lower part. The inner two-thirds of this surface afford attachment to the Infraspinatus muscle ; the outer third is only covered by it, without giving origin to its fibres. This surface is separated from the axillary border by an elevated ridge, which runs from the lower part of the glenoid cavity, downwards and backwards to the posterior border, about an inch above the inferior

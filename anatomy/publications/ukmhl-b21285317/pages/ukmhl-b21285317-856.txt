THE THORAX. 688 commencement of the aorta ; they are larger than the pulmonary sinuses. The blood, in its regurgitation towards the heart, finds its way into these sinuses, and so shuts down the valve-flaps. The pulmonary valves are situated behind the junction of the left third rib with the sternum. The Left Auricle is rather smaller but thicker than the right, measuring about one line and a half; it consists, like the right, of two parts, a principal cavity or sinus, and an appendix auriculae. The sinus is cuboidal in form, and concealed in front by the pulmonary artery and aorta; internally it is separated from the right auricle by the septum auricu- larum ; behind, it receives on each side the pulmonary veins, being free in the rest of its extent. The appendix auriculae, is somewhat constricted at its junction with the auricle ; it is longer, narrower, and more curved than that of the right side, and its margins 391.â€”The Left Auricle and Ventricle laid open, the Anterior Walls of both being removed. more deeply indented, presenting a kind of foliated appearance. Its direction is forwards and towards the right side, overlapping the root of the pulmonary artery. In order to examine its interior, a horizontal incision should he made along the attached border of the auricle to the ventricle; and from the middle of this a second incision sbould be carried upwards. The following parts then present themselves for examination The openings of the four pulmonary veins. Auriculo-ventricular opening. Musculi pectinati. The pulmonary veins, four in number, open, two into the light, and two into the left side of the auricle. The two left veins frequently terminate by a common open ing. They are not provided with valves. The auriculo-ventricular opening is the large oval aperture of communication between the auricle and ventricle. It is rather smaller than the corresponding opening on the opposite side (see note, p. 686).

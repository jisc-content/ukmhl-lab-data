456 LYMPHATICS The superficial lymphatics of the head are divided into an anterior and a posterior set, which follow the course of the temporal and occipital vessels. The temporal set accompany the temporal artery in front of the ear, to the parotid lymphatic glands, from which they proceed to the lymphatic glands of the neck. The occipital set follow the coarse of the occipital artery, descend to the occipital and posterior auricular lymphatic glands, and from thence join the cervical glands. The superficial lymphatics of the face are more numerous than those of the head, and commence over its entire surface. Those from the frontal region accompany the frontal vessels ; they then pass obliquely across the face, running with the facial vein, 254.â€”The Superficial Lympkat:cs and Glands of the Head, Face, and Neck. pass through the buccal glands on the surface of the Buccinator muscle, and join the submaxillary lymphatic glands. The latter receive the lymphatic vessels from the lips, and are often found enlarged in cases of malignant disease of those parts. The deep lymphatics of the face are derived from the pituitary membrane of the nose, the mucous membrane of the mouth and pharynx, and the contents of the temporal and orbital fossae; they accompany the branches of the internal maxillary artery, and terminate in the deep parotid, and cervical lymphatic glands. The deep lymphatics of the cranium consist of two sets, the meningeal and cere- bral. The meningeal lymphatics accompany the meningeal vessels, escape through foramina at the base of the skull, and join the deep cervical lymphatic glands. The cerebral lymphatics are described by Eshmann as being situated between the arach-

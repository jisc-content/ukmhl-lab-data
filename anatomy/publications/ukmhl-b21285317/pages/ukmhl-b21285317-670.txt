NERVOUS SYSTEM. 5°2 centre, and about six lines at the circumference, which is the thinnest part. It consists of grey and white matter: the former, darker than that of the cerebrum, occupies the surface ; the latter, the interior. The surface of the cerebellum is not convoluted like the cerebrum, but traversed by numerous curved furrows or sulci, which vary in depth at different parts, and separate the laminae of which its exterior is composed. Its upper surface (fig. 279) is somewhat elevated in the median line, and depressed 279.—Upper Surface of the Cerebellum. towards its circumference ; it consists of two lateral hemispheres, connected together by an elevated median portion or lobe, the superior vermiform process. The median lobe is the fundamental part, and in some animals, as fishes and reptiles, the only part which exists; the hemispheres being additions, and attaining their maximum size in man. The hemispheres are separated, in front, by a deep notch, the incisura cerebelli anterior, which encircles the corpora quadrigemina behind ; they are also separated by a similar notch behind, the incisura cerebelli posterior, in which is received the upper part of the falx cerebelli. The superior vermiform process (upper 280.—Under Surface of the Cerebellum. that on the posterior border. It is divided into three lobes : the lobulus centralis, a small lobe, situated in the incisura anterior; the monticulus cerebelli, the central projecting part of the process; and the commissura simplex, a small lobe near the incisura posterior. The under surface of the cerebellum (fig. 280) is subdivided into two lateral hemispheres by a depression, the valley, which extends from before backwards in the

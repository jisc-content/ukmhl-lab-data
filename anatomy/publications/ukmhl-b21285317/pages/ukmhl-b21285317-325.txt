i57 SPINE WITH THE CRANIUM. of its lateral mass. As it crosses the odontoid process, a small fasciculus is derived from its upper and lower borders; the former passing upwards, to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone; the latter, downwards, to be attached to the root of the odontoid process; hence, the whole ligament has received the name of cruciform. The transverse ligament divides the ring of the atlas into two unequal parts : of these, the posterior and larger serves for the transmission of the cord and its membranes; the anterior and smaller contains the odontoid process. Since the lower border of the space between the anterior arch of the atlas and the transverse ligament is smaller than the upper (because the transverse ligament embraces firmly the narrow neck of the odontoid process) this process is retained in firm connection with the atlas when all the other ligaments have been divided. The Capsular Ligaments are two thin and loose capsules, connecting the articular surfaces of the atlas and axis, the fibres being strongest on the anterior and external part of the articulation. 120.—Occipito-Axoid and Atlo-Axoid Ligaments. Posterior View, obtained by removing the arches of the Vertebras and the posterior part of the Skull. There are four Synovial Membranes in this articulation • one lining the inner surface of each of the capsular ligaments • one between the anterior surface of the odontoid process and the anterior arch of the atlas; and one between the posterior surface of the odontoid process and the transverse ligament. The latter often communicates with those between the condyles of the occipital bone and the articular surfaces of the atlas. Actions. This joint is capable of great mobility, and allows the rotation of the atlas (and, with it, of the cranium) upon the axis, the extent of rotation being limited by the odontoid ligaments. Articulations of the Smne with the Cranium. The ligaments connecting the spine with the cranium may be divided into two sets, those connecting the occipital bone with the atlas, and those connecting the occipital bone with the axis.

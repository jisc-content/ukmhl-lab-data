SUPERFICIAL FASCIA. 765 Nerves.—The terminal branch of the ilioinguinal nerve emerges at the external abdominal ring; and the hypogastric branch of the ilio-hypogastric nerve perforates the aponeurosis of the external oblique, above and to the outer side of the external ring. The deep layer of superficial fascia should be divided across in the same direction as the external incisions, separated from the aponeurosis of the External oblique, to which it is connected by delicate areolar tissue, and reflected downwards and out- wards. It is thin, aponeurotic in structure, and of considerable strength. It is intimately adherent, in the middle line, to the linea alba, and below, to the whole length of Poupart's ligament and the upper part of the fascia lata. It forms a 438. — Inguinal Hernia. Superficial Dissection. thin tubular prolongation round the outer surface of the cord, and is continuous with the dartos of the scrotum. From the back of the scrotum - it may be traced into the perinseum, where it is continuous with the deep layer of the superficial fascia in that region, which is attached, behind, to the triangular ligament, and on each side to the ramus of the pubes and ischium. The connections of this fascia serve to explain the course taken by the urine in extravasation of that fluid from rupture of the urethra : passing forwards from the perinseum into the scrotum, it ascends on to the abdomen, but is prevented extending into the thighs by the attachment of the fascia to the ramus of the pubes and ischium on each side, and to Poupart's ligament in front, and is prevented from passing on to the buttock by the posterior connections of the perinseal fascia. The aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle is exposed on the removal of thi.x faacia. It is a thin, strong, membranous aponeurosis, the fibres of which are directed

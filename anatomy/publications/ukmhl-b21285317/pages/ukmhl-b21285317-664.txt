NERVOUS SYSTEM. 496 The fifth ventricle may be exposed by cutting through the septum, and attached portion of the corpus callosum, with scissors; after examining which, the corpus callosum should be cut across, towards its anterior part, and the two portions carefully dissected, the one forwards, the other backwards, when tbe fornix will be exposed. The fornix (figs. 274, 276, 278) is a longitudinal lamella of white fibrous matter, situated beneath the corpus callosum, with which it is continuous behind, but separated from it in front by the septum lucidum. It may be described as consisting of two symmetrical halves, one for either hemisphere. These two portions are joined together in the middle line, where they form the body, but are separated from one another in front and behind ; forming the anterior and posterior crura. The body of the fornix is triangular ; narrow in front, broad behind. Its upper 276.â€”The Fornix, Velum Interpositum, and Middle or Descending Cornu of the Lateral Ventricle. surface is connected, in the median line, to the septum lucidum in front, and the cor pus callosum behind. Its under surface rests upon tbe velum interpositum, which separates it from the third ventricle, and the inner portion of the optic thalami. Its lateral edges form, on each side, part of the floor of the lateral ventricles, and are in contact with the choroid plexuses. The anterior crura arch downwards towards the base of the brain, separated from each other by a narrow interval. They are composed of white fibres, which descend through a quantity of grey matter in the lateral walls of the third ventricle, and are placed immediately behind the anterior commissure. At the base of the brain, the white fibres of each crus form a sudden curve upon themselves, spread out and form the outer part of the corresponding corpus albicans, from which point they may be traced upwards into the substance of the corresponding optic thalamus (fig. 278).

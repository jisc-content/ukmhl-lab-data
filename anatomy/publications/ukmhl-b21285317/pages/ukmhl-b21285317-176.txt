The Tenth Dorsal has (except in the case-; just mentioned) an entire articular facet on each side above ; it has no demi-facet below. In the Elevmth Dorsal, the body approaches in its form and size to the lumbar. The articular facets for the heads of the ribs, one on each side, are of large size, 6.—Peculiar Dorsal Vertebra.

The transverse pro cesses are very short, tubercular at their extremities, and have no articular facets for the tubercles of the ribs. The spinous process is short, nearly horizontal m direction, and presents a slight tendency to bifurcation at its extremity. The Twelfth Dorsal has the same general diameters as the eleventh ; but may

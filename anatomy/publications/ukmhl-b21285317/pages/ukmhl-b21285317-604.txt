On the inner wall of each sinus is found the internal carotid artery, accompanied by filaments of the carotid plexus and by the sixth nerve; and on its outer wall, the third, fourth, and ophthalmic nerves. These parts are separated from the blood flowing along the sinus by the lining membrane, winch is continuous with the inner coat of the veins. The cavity of the sinus, which 243.—Plan showing the Relative Position of the Structures in the Right Cavernous Sinus, Viewed from Behind. is larger behind than in front, is intersected by filaments of fibrous tissue and small vessels. The cavernous sinuses receive the inferior anterior cerebral veins; they communicate with the lateral sinuses by means of the superior and inferior petrosal, and with the facial vein through the ophthalmic. The ophthalmic is a large vein, which connects the angular vein at the inner angle of the orbit with the cavernous sinus ; it pursues the same course as the ophthalmic 244.—The Sinuses at the Base of the Skull. artery, and receives branches corresponding to those derived from that vessel. Forming a short single trunk, it passes through the inner extremity of the sphenoidal fissure, and terminates in the cavernous sinus. The Circular Sinus completely surrounds the pituitary body, and communicates

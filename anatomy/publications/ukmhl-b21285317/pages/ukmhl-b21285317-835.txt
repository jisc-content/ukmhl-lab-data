THE LIVER. 667 into two parts by a deep notch (sometimes a canal), -which lodges the inferior vena cava, and into which open the hepatic veins. The round ligament (fig. 378) is a fibrous cord resulting from the obliteration of the umbilical vein. It ascends from the umbilicus, in the anterior free margin of the longitudinal ligament, to the notch in the anterior border of the liver, from 377-—The Liver. Upper Surface. which it may be traced along the longitudinal fissure on the under surface of the liver, as far back as the inferior vena cava. Fissures (fig. 378).—Five fissures are seen upon the under surface of the liver, which serve to divide it into five lobes. They are the longitudinal fissure, the fissure of the ductus venosus, the transverse fissure, the fissure for the gall-bladder, and the 378.—The Liver. Under Surface. fissure for the vena cava. They are arranged in the form of the letter A; the apex of the letter corresponding to the posterior margin of the liver, its base to the anterior free border. The connecting bar would represent the transverse fissure; the two converging limbs posterior to this would represent, the left one, the fissure.for the

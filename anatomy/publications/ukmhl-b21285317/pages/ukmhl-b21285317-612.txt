444 YETNS the foramina on their posterior surface, and join the transverse trunk connecting the anterior longitudinal spinal veins. They are contained in large tortuous channels, in the substance of the bones, similar in every respect to those found in the diploe of the cranial bones. These canals lie parallel to the upper and lower surface of the bones. They commence by small openings on the front and sides of the bodies of the vertebrae, 248.—Transverse Section of a Dorsal Vertebra, showing' the Spinal Veins. through which communicating branches from the veins external to the bone pass into its substance, and converge to the principal canal, which is sometimes double towards its posterior part. They become greatly developed in advanced age. 4. The Veins of the Spinal Cord (medulli-spinal) consist of a minute tortuous venous plexus which covers the entire surface of the cord, being situated between the pia mater and arachnoid. These vessels emerge chiefly from the posterior median 249 —Vertical Section of two Dorsal Vertebrae, showing the Spinal Veins. furrow, and are largest in the lumbar region. Near the base of the skull they unite, and form two or three small trunks, which communicate with the vertebral veins, and then terminate in the inferior cerebellar veins, or in the petrosal sinuses. Each of the spinal nerves is accompanied by a branch as far as the intervertebral foramina, where they join the other veins from the spinal canal. There are no valves in the spinal veins.

SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 774 brane. External to the vein it can scarcely be separated as a continuous layer. It is placed beneath the subcutaneous vessels and nerves, and upon the surface of the fascia lata. It is intimately adherent above to the lower margin of Poupart's liga- ment, and about one inch below this ligament covers the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, is closely united to its circumference, and is connected to the sheath of the femoral vessels corresponding to its under surface. The portion of fascia covering this aperture is perforated by the internal saphenous vein, and by numerous blood and lymphatic vessels; hence it has been termed the cribriform fascia, the openings of these vessels having been likened to the holes in a sieve. The cribriform fascia adheres closely both to the superficial fascia and the fascia lata, so that it is described 442.â€”Femoral Hernia. Superficial Dissection. by some anatomists as a part of the fascia lata, but is usually considered (as in this work) as belonging to the superficial fascia. It is not till the cribriform fascia has been cleared away that the saphenous opening is seen, so that this opening does not in ordinary cases exist naturally, but is the result of dissection. Mr. Callender, how- ever, speaks of cases in which, probably as the result of pressure from enlarged inguinal glands, the fascia has become atrophied, and a saphenous opening exists in- dependent of dissection.* A femoral hernia, in passing through the saphenous opening, receives the cribriform fascia as one of its coverings. The deep layer of superficial fascia, together with the cribriform fascia, having been removed, the fascia lata is exposed. The Fascia Lata, already described (p. 297), is a dense fibrous aponeurosis, which * Anatomy of Femoral Rupture, note on p. 18.

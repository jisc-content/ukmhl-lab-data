53i NINTH. descends almost vertically to a point corresponding with the angle of the jaw. It is at first deeply seated beneath the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and intimately connected with the pneumogastric nerve ; it then passes forwards between the vein and artery, and lower down in the neck becomes superficial below the Digastric muscle. The nerve then loops round the occipital artery, and crosses the external carotid below the tendon of the Digastric muscle. It passes beneath the Mylo-hyoid muscle, lying between it and the Hyo-glossus, and communicates at the anterior border of the latter muscle with the gustatory nerve; it is then continued forwards in the fibres of the Genio-hyo-glossus muscle as far as the tip of the tongue, distributing branches to its substance. 294.â€”Hypoglossal Nerve, Cervical Plexus, and their Branches. Branches of this nerve communicate with the Pneumogastric. Pirst and second cervical nerves. Sympathetic. Gustatory. The communication with the pneumogastric takes place close to the exit of the nerve from the skull, numerous filaments passing between the hypoglossal and lower ganglion of the pneumogastric ; sometimes the two nerves are united so as to form one mass. The communication with the sympathetic takes place opposite the atlas by branches derived from the superior cervical ganglion, and in the same situation the nerve is joined by a filament derived from the loop connecting the first two cervical nerves.

NERVOUS SYSTEM. 484 fissure, to distinguish it from the continuation of the sulcus on the internal surface of the hemisphere, which would then be termed the internal parieto-occipital fissure. It commences about midway between the posterior extremity of the brain and the fissure of Rolando, and runs downwards and forwards for a variable distance, becoming indistinct below. These three fissures divide the external surface of the hemisphere into five lobes : the frontal, the parietal, the occipital, the temporo-splienoidal, and the central or island of Reil. The frontal lobe is that portion of the brain which is situated in front of the fissure of Rolando and above the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius. Its under surface rests on the orbital plate of the frontal bone, and is termed the orbital lobe. 270.â€”Convolutions and Fissures of the Under Surface of the Anterior Lobe. The ascending limb of the fissure of Sylvius, called also the precentral fissure, tuns upwards through this lobe, dividing off a convolution, which lies between it and the fissure of Rolando, and which is called the ascending frontal convolution. The remainder of the lobe on the outer surface, namely, that part in front of the ascending limb of the fissure of Sylvius, is divided into three principal convolutions by two transverse sulci, named respectively the superior, middle, and inferior frontal convolutions. The under surface of the frontal lobe, which rests on the orbital plate of the frontal bone, is named the orbital lobe (fig. 270). It presents a well-marked groove or sulcus for the olfactory nerve. The convolution internal to this sulcus forms part of the marginal gyrus, hereafter to be described. External to the sulcus this surface of the frontal lobe is divided into three convolutions, which are named from their positions, the internal, external, and posterior orbital convolutions.

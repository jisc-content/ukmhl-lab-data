777 GIMBERNAT'S LIGAMENT. of Poupart's ligament is curved downwards towards the thigh ; its outer half being oblique, its inner half nearly horizontal. Nearly the whole of the space included between the crural arch and innominate bone is filled in by the parts which descend from the abdomen into the thigh. The outer half of the space is occupied by the Iliacus and Psoas muscles, together with the external cutaneous and anterior crural nerves. The pubic side of the space is occupied by the femoral vessels included in their sheath, a small oval-shaped interval existing between the femoral vein and the inner wail of the sheath, which is occupied merely by a little loose areolar tissue, and occasionally by a small lymphatic gland : this is the crural canal, along which the gut descends in femoral hernia. 444.—Femoral Hernia. Iliac Portion of Fascia Lata removed, and Sheath of Femoral Vessels and Femoral Canal exposed. Gimbernat's Ligament (fig. 446) is that part of the aponeurosis of the ExternaJ oblique muscle which is reflected downwards and outwards, to be inserted into the pectineal line of the os pubis. It is about an inch in length, larger in the male than in the female, almost horizontal in direction in the erect posture, and of a triangular form, the base directed outwards. Its base, or outer margin, is concave, thin and sharp, lies in contact with the crural sheath, and is blended with the pubic portion of the fascia lata. Its apex corresponds to the spine of the pubes. Its posterior margin is attached to the pectineal line. Its anterior margin is continuous with Poupart's ligament. Crural Sheath.—If Poupart's ligament is divided, the femoral or crural sheath may be demonstrated as a continuation downwards of the fasciae that line the abdomen, the transversalis fascia passing down in front of the femoral vessels, and the iliac fascia descending behind them : these fasciae are directly continuous on the

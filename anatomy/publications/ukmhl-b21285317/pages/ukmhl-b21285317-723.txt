LUMBAR PLEXUS. 555 The size of this nerve is in inverse proportion to that of the ilio-hypogastric. Occa- sionally it is very small, and ends by joining the ilio-hypogastric; in such cases, a branch from the ilio-hypogastric takes the place of the ilio inguinal, or the latter nerve may be altogether absent. The Genito-crural Nerve arises from the second lumbar, and by a few fibres from the cord of communication between it and the first. It passes obliquely through the substance of the Psoas, descends on its surface to near Poupart's ligament, and divides into a genital and a crural branch. The genital branch descends on the external iliac artery, sending a few filaments round tbat vessel; it then pierces the fascia transversalis, and, passing through the 303.â€”The Lumbal' Plexus and its Brandies * internal abdominal ring, descends along the back part of the spermatic cord to the scrotum, and supplies, in the male, the Cremaster muscle. In the female, it accom- panies the round ligament, and is lost upon it. The crural branch passes along the inner margin of the Psoas muscle, beneath Poupart's ligament, into the thigh, entering the sheath of the femoral vessels, and lying superficial and a little external to the femoral artery. It pierces the anterior layer of the sheath of the vessels, and becoming superficial by passing through the fascia lata, it supplies the skin of the anterior aspect of the thigh as far as midway between the pelvis and knee. On the front of the thigh it communicates with the outer branch of the middle cutaneous nerve, derived from the anterior crural. A few filaments from this nerve may be traced on to the femoral artery; they are derived from the nerve as it passes beneath Poupart's ligament. * The arrangement of the lumbar plexus on the right side in this woodcut is not strictly correct.

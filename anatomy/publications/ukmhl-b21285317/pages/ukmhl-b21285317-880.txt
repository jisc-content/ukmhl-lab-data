712 ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION. The weight of both lungs together is about forty-two ounces, the right lung being two ounces heavier than the left; but much variation is met with according to the amount of blood or serous fluid they may contain. The lungs are heavier in the male than in the female, their proportion to the body being, in the former, as i to 37, in the latter as 1 to 43. The specific gravity of the lung-tissue varies from 345 to 746, water being 1,000. The size of the lungs varies much according to their degree of inflation, so that no accurate measurements can be given. When fully inflated the total capacity for air at a temperature of 6o°, in an adult male of mean height (about five foot, seven inches), is believed to be on the average 282 cubic inches. The amount which can be expelled by the most forcible expiration after an extreme inspiration is, according 404.—Front View of the Heart and Lungs. to Hutchinson, 225 cubic inches. This quantity is called by Hutchinson the ' vital capacity of the lungs.' The quantity of air contained in the lungs after the most forcible expiration would be, therefore, 5 7 cubic inches. This is termed ' residual' air. The amount of air which can be expelled by an extreme expiration after a forced inspiration varies according to the height of the individual; increasing at a uniform rate of eight cubic inches for every additional inch in height above five feet.* The colour of the lungs at birth is a pinkish white ; in adult life, a dark slate- colour, mottled in patches ; and as age advances, this mottling assumes a black colour. The colouring matter consists of granules of a carbonaceous substance deposited in the areolar tissue near the surface of the organ. It increases in quan- tity as age advances, and is more abundant in males than in females. The posterior border of the lung is usually darker than the anterior. The surface of the lung is * Cyiiopccdia of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. iv. p. 1072.

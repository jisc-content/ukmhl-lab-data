CRANIAL NERVES. 526 very small size, and involves only the outer side of the trunk of the nerve, a small fasciculus passing beyond it, which is not connected directly with it. The inferior, or petrous ganglion, is situated in a de- 293—Course and Distribution of the Eighth pression in the lower border •Pair of Nerves- of the petrous portion of the temporal bone ; it is larger than the former, and involves the whole of the fibres of the nerve. From this ganglion arise those filaments which connect the glossopharyngeal with other nerves at the base of the skull. Its branches of communi- cation are with the pnenmo- gastric and sympathetic. The branches to the pneu- mogastric are two filaments, one to its auricular branch, and one to the upper ganglion of the pneumogastric. The branch to the sympa- thetic is connected with the superior cervical ganglion. There is also a branch of communication with the facial which perforates the posterior belly of the Digastric. It arises from the trunk of the nerve below the petrous gan- glion, and joins the facial just after its exit from the stylo- mastoid foramen. The branches of the glosso- pharyngeal nerve are the tympanic, carotid, pharyngeal, muscular, tonsillar, and lin- gual. The tympanic branch (Ja- cobson's nerve) arises from the petrous ganglion, and enters a small bony canal in the lower surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone; the lower opening of which is situated on the bony ridge which separates the carotid canal from the jugular fossa. Jacobson's nerve ascends to the tympanum, enters that cavity by an aperture in its floor close to the inner wall, and divides into three branches, which are contained in grooves upon the surface of the promontory, forming the tympanic plexus. Its brandies of distribution are, one to the fenestra rotunda, one to the fenestra ovalis, and one to the lining membrane of the Eustachian tube and tympanum.

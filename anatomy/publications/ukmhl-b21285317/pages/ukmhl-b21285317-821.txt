THE SMALL INTESTINES. 653 vertebra. It is covered by peritoneum only on its anterior surface. It is in relation, in front, with the right arch of the colon and the meso-colon; behind, with the front of the right kidney; at its inner side is the head of the pancreas, and the ductus communis choledochus. The common bile-duct and the pancreatic duct perforate the inner side of this portion of the intestine obliquely, a little below its middle. The third, or transverse portion, the longest and narrowest part of the duodenum, passes across the front of the spine, ascending from the third to the second lumbar 363.—Relations of the Duodenum. (A portion of the stomach has been cut away.) vertebra, and terminating in the jejunum on the left side of that bone. In front, though at some distance from it, is the descending layer of the transverse meso-colon, or the divergence of the two layers of that structure, and it is crossed by the superior mesenteric vessels; behind, it rests upon the aorta, the vena cava, and the crura of the Diaphragm ; above it is the lower border of the pancreas, the superior mesenteric vessels passing forwards between the two. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries supplying the duodenum are the pyloric and pancreatico-duodenal branches of the hepatic, and the inferior pancreatico-duodenal branch of the superior mesenteric. The veins terminate in the splenic and superior mesenteric. The nerves are derived from the solar plexus.

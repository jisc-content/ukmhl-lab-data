SEVENTH. FACIAL. 523 The Tympanic branch arises from the nerve opposite the pyramid ; it is a small filament, which supplies the Stapedius and Laxator tympani * muscles. The Chorda tympani is given off from the facial as it passes vertically downwards at the back of the tympanum, about a quarter of an inch before its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen. It passes from below upwards in a distinct canal, parallel with the aquaeductus Fallopii, and enters the cavity of the tympanum, through an opening (iter chordae posterius) between the base of the pyramid and the attachment of the meinbrana tympani, and becomes invested with mucous membrane. It passes 291.—The Nerves of the Scalp, Face, and Side of the Neck. forwards through the cavitj' of the tympanum, between the handle of the malleus and vertical ramus of the incus, to its anterior inferior angle, and emerges from that cavity through a foramen at the inner side of the Glaserian fissure which is called the iter chordae anterius, or canal of Huguier. It then descends between the two Pterygoid muscles, and meets the gustatory nerve at an acute angle, after communi- cating with which, it accompanies it to the submaxillary gland ; part of it then joins the submaxillai-y ganglion, the rest is continued onwards into the proper muscular fibres of the tongue—the Lingualis muscle. * Many anatomists regard this muscle as a ligament, and its nervous supply is doubtful.

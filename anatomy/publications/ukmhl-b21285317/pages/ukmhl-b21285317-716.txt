SPINAL NERVES. 543 Nerves. The deep palmar branch passes between the Abductor and Flexor brevis minim digiti muscles, and follows the course of the deep palmar arch beneath the flexor tendons. At its origin, it supplies the muscles of the 300.—The Suprascapular, Circumflex, and Musculo-Spiral little finger. As it crosses the deep part of the hand, it sends two branches to each interosseous space, one for the Dorsal and one for the Palmar interosseous muscle, the branches to the second and third Palmar interossei supplying fila- ments to the two inner Lumbricales muscles. At its termination between the thumb and index finger, it supplies the Adductor pol- licis and the inner head of the Flexor brevis pollicis. The Musculo-Spihal Nerve (fig. 300), the larg- est branch of the brachial plexus, supplies the mus- cles of the back part of the arm and fore-arm, and the integument of the same parts, as well as that of the back of the hand. It arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus by a common trunk with the circumflex nerve, and is afterwards joined by the posterior division of the trunk, formed by the junc- tion of the eight cervical and first dorsal nerves. Afc its commencement it is placed behind the axillary and upper part of the bra- chial arteries, passing down in front of the tendons of the Latissimus dorsi and Teres major. It winds round the humerus in the musculo-spiral groove with the superior profunda artery, passing from the inner to the outer side of the bone, between the internal and external heads of the Triceps muscle. It' pierces the external intermuscular septum and descends between the Brachialis anticus and Supinator longus to the front of the external condyle, where it divides into the radial and posterior interosseous nerves. The branches of the musculo-spiral nerve are :—■ Muscular. Radial. Cutaneous. Posterior interosseous.

537 CERVICAL PLEXUS. descend in the interval between that muscle and the Trapezius, and divide into branches, which are arranged, according to their position, into three groups. The inner or sternal branch crosses obliquely over the clavicular and sternal attachments of the Sterno-mastoid, and supplies the integument as far as the median line. The middle or clavicular branch crosses the clavicle, and supplies the integument over the Pectoral and Deltoid muscles, communicating with the cutaneous branches of the upper intercostal nerves. The clavicular branch has been known to pass through a foramen in the clavicle, at the junction of the outer with the middle third of the bone. 295.â€”Plan of the Cervical Plexus. RECT. CAP . LAT. The external or acromial branch passes obliquely across the outer surface of the Trapezius and the acromion, and supplies the integument of the upper and back part of the shoulder. Deep Branches of the Cervical Plexus. Internal Series. The comrnunicatintj branches consist of several filaments, which pass from the loop between the first and second cervical nerves in front of the atlas to the pneumo- gastric, hypoglossal, and sympathetic ; and a communicating branch between the fourth and fifth cervical. Muscular bfanches supply the Anterior recti and Rectus lateralis muscles j they proceed from the first cervical nerve, and from the loop formed between it and the second. The Communicans Noni (fig. 294) consists usually df two filaments, one being

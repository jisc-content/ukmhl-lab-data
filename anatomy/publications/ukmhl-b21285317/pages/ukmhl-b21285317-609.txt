INNOMINATE AND THEIR TRIBUTARIES. 247.â€”The Vena; Cava? and Azygos Veins, with their Formative Branches. .External Jugular "Middle Thyroid if/A the heart, where it remains pervious, and forms the coro- nary sinus ; a remnant of the obliterated vessel is seen in adult life as a fibrous hand passing along tbe back of the left auricle and iu front of the root of the left lung, called by Mr. Marshall the vestigial fold of the pericardium. The internal mammary veins, two in number to each artery, follow the course of that vessel, and receive branches corre- sponding with those de- rived from it. The two veins of each side unite into a single trunk, which terminates in the innomi- nate vein. The inferior thyroid vein!), two, frequently three or four in number, arise in the venous plexus on the thyroid body, communicat- ing with the middle and superior thyroid veins. The left one descends in front of the trachea, behind the Sterno-thyroid muscles, communicating fellow by branches, and in the left with its transverse terminates vena innomi- nata. The right one, which is placed a little to the right of the median line, opens into the right vena innominata, just at its junction with the superior cava. These veins receive tracheal and inferior laryn- geal branches, and are provided with valves at their termination in the innominate veins. The Superior Inter- costal Veins return the blood from the upper in- tercostal spaces. The right superior in- tercostal, much smaller than the left, closely corresponds with the superior inter- costal artery, receiving tho blood from the first, or first and second intercostal spaces, and terminates in the right vena innominata. Sometimes it passes down, and opens into the vena azygos major.

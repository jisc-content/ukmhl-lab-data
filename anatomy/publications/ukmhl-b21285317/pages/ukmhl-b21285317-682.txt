CRANIAL NERVES. 5*4 to enter the infra-orbital canal; they are two in number aiid pass downwards on the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone. One of them enters a canal in the sub- stance of the superior maxillary bone, passes from behind forwards, and joins oppo- site the canine fossa with the anterior dental. Numerous filaments are given off" from the lower border of this nerve, which form a minute plexus in the outer wall of the superior maxillary bone, immediately above the alveoli. From this plexus filaments are distributed to the pulp of the molar and second bicuspid teeth, the lining membrane of the antrum, and corresponding portion of the gums. The other branch is distributed to the gums and Buccinator muscle. The anterior dental, of large size, is given off from the superior maxillary nerve just before its exit from the infra-orbital foramen; it enters a special canal in the 286.â€”Distribution of the Second and Third Divisions of the Fifth Nerve and Submaxillary Ganglion. anterior wall of the antrum, and communicates with the posterior dental. From this nerve some filaments are distributed to the incisor, canine, and first bicuspid teeth] others are lost upon the lining membrane covering the fore part of the inferior meatus. In this situation it forms the communication with a nasal branch from Meckel's ganglion called the ganglion of Bochalaleh. The palpebral branches pass upwards beneath the Orbicularis palpebrarum. They supply this muscle, the integument, and conjunctiva of the lower eyelid with sensation, joining at the outer angle of the orbit with the facial nerve and malar branch of the orbital. The nasal branches pass inwards; they supply the muscles and integument of the side of the nose, and join with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic. The labial branches^ the largest and most numerous, descend beneath the Levator

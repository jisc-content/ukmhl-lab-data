xlv FIBROUS TISSUE. and in the areolar tissue, when thus treated, the yellow elastic element comes alone into view. The yellow elastic fibrous tissue (Fig. VII.) is an aggregation of curling fibres, which are considerably larger in size than the fibrillae of the white fibrous element, varying from ^ to ^ of an inch in diameter (Harley). The fibres branch and anastomose freely with one another. They are homogeneous in appearance, with dark borders, and have a tendency to curl up, especially at their broken ends. They remain unaltered by acetic acid. Cellular tissue consists then of spaces formed by these fibres, united together by a homogeneous cement or ground substance and filled by cellular Fig. VII.—Yellow elastic tissue. High power.

Achillis of a new-born elements, which contain the protoplasm out of which the whole is developed and regenerated. These cell-spaces may be brought into view by treating the tissue with nitrate of silver, and exposing it to the light. This will colour the fibres and ground substance, leaving the cell-spaces unstained. Each of these elements of the connective tissue is developed from cells. Kolliker describes the yellow elastic fibres as developed from the stellate branching corpuscles, which may sometimes be found free in the areolar tissue, and which Virchow has denominated ' connective-tissue corpuscles ' (Fig. VIII.); while the white fibrous tissue is formed from the coalescence of fusiform cells, which elongate into fibrillae, as shown by Fig. IX. The two tissues just described are very widely distributed in the body, especially the white fibrous tissue. This latter forms nearly the whole of

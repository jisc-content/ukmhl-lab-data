The urachus is obliterated before the termination of foetal life; but the cord formed by its obliteration is perceptible throughout life, passing from the upper part of the bladder to the umbilicus, and occasionally remains patent during life, constituting a well-known deformity. The permanent kidneys are almost, if not entirely, independent of the Wolffian bodies or primordial kidneys in their development, though they originate in the same mass of blastema, the intermediate cell-mass behind the Wolffian body. As their distance from the bladder increases, the ureters become developed, and the simple culs-dc-sac in which the fcetal kidneys commence divide and sub- Fig. 01.â€”Diagram of the primitive urogenital organs in the embryo previous to sexual dis- tinction.

The mode of development of the ureters is not exactly known. Some embryologists describe them as extending gradually from the allantois upwards, so that the proper tissue of the kidney would be developed upon projections, or buds, out of the upper ends of the ureters. Others describe the ureter as an offset from the upper part of the Wolffian duct. Others teach that the kidney-tissue is formed before the ureter, and that the ducts of the former are hollowed out and open into the latter. Others, again, believe that the whole organ (kidney and ureter) is laid down in the same mass of blastema, which is at first solid, and that the various ducts or hollow spaces are formed in each part simultaneously.

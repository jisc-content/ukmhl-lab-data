22 THE SKELETON. on each side of it, but nearer its anterior than its posterior part, the internal openings of the anterior condyloid foramina ; the internal openings of the posterior condyloid foramina are a little external and posterior to them, protected by a small arch of bone. At this part of the internal surface there is a very deep groove, in which the posterior condyloid foramen, when it exists, has its termination inside the skull. This groove is continuous in the complete skull with that which separates the upper from the lower fossae, and lodges the end of the same sinus, the lateral. In front of the foramen magnum is the basilar process, presenting a 23.-- Occipital Bone. Inner Surface. shallow depression, the basilar groove, which slojies from behind, upwards and forwards, and supports the medulla oblongata and part of the Pons Varolii, and on each side of the basilar process is a narrow channel, which, when united with a similar channel on the petrous portion of the temporal bone, forms a groove, which lodges the inferior petrosal sinus. Angles. The superior angle is received into the interval between the posterior superior angles of the two parietal hones: it corresponds with that part of the skull in the fcetus which is called the posterior fontaneUe. The inferior angle is represented by the square-shaped surface of the basilar process. At an early period of life, a layer of cartilage separates this part of the bone from the sphenoid ; but in the adult, the union bet ween them is osseous. The lateral angles correspond to the outer ends of the transverse grooves, and are received into the interval between the posterior inferior angles of the parietal and the mastoid portion of the temporal.

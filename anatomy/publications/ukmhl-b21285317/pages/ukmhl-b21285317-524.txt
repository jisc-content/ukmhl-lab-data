It then passes across the nerve, to the inner wall of the orbit, and thence horizontally forwards, beneath the lower border of the Superior oblique muscle to the inner angle of the eye, where it divides into two terminal branches, the frontal, and nasal. Brandies. The branches of this vessel may be divided into an orbital group, which are distributed to the orbit and surrounding parts; and an ocular group, which supply the muscles and globe of the eye. 217.—The Ophthalmic Artery and its Branches, the Roof of the Orbit having- been removed. frontal Sr,j,rir Orhital Aniemor EBimeMa ' J?ostt.rLor Ethmoidal —Ujtlith a.hm.i'O ■Internal Carotid Orbital Group.

The lachrymal is the first, and one of the largest branches, derived from the ophthalmic, arising close to the optic foramen : not unfrequently it is given off from the artery before it enters the orbit. It accompanies the lachrymal nerve along the upper border of the External rectus muscle, and is distributed to the lachrymal gland. Its terminal branches, escaping from the gland, are distributed to the upper eyelid and conjunctiva, anastomosing with the palpebral arteries. The lachrymal artery gives off one or two malar branches; one of which passes through a foramen in the malar bone, to reach the temporal fossa, and anastomoses with the deep temporal arteries. The other appears on the cheek, and anasto- moses with the transvers3 facial. A branch is also sent backwards, through the sphenoidal fissure, to the dura mater, which anastomoses with a branch of the middle meningeal artery.

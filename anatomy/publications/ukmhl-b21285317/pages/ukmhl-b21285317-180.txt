Sacral and Coccygeal Vertebr.e. The Sacral and Coccygeal Vertebra? consist, at an early period of life, of nine separate pieces, which are united in the adult, so as to form two bones, five entering into the formation of the sacrum, four into that of the coccyx. Occasionally, the coccyx consists of five bones.* The Sacrum (fig. 14) is a large triangular bone, situated at the lower part 14.—Sacrum, Anterior Surface. of the vertebral column, and at the upper and back part of the pelvic cavity, whore it is inserted like a wedge between the two ossa innominata; its upper part, or base, articulating with the last lumbar vertebra, its apex with the coccyx. The sacrum is curved upon itself, and placed very obliquely, its upper extremity projecting forwards, and forming, with the last lumbar vertebra, a very prominent * Dr. Humphry describes this as the usual composition of the Coccyx.- On the Skeleton, p. 456.

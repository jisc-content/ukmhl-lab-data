The loiver branch, at its origin, distributes filaments to the Teres minor and back part of the Deltoid muscles. Upon the filament to the former muscle a gangliform enlargement usually exists. The nerve then pierces the deep fascia, and supplies the 297.—Cutaneous Nerves of Right Upper 298.—Cutaneous Nerves of Right Upper Extremity. Anterior View. Extremity.

The circumflex nerve, before its division, gives off an articular filament, which enters the shoulder-joint below the Subscapulars. The Musculocutaneous Nerve (fig. 299) (external cutaneous) or perforans Cas- serii), supplies some of the muscles of the arm, and the integument of the fore-arm.

They have not at present been demonstrated in the dura mater, or in the substance of the brain. The Lymphatic Glands of the Neck are divided into two sets, superficial and deep. The superficial cervical glands are placed in the course of the external jugular vein, between the Platysma and Sterno-mastoid. They are most numerous at the root of the neck, in the triangular interval between the clavicle, the Sterno-mastoid, and 255.â€”The Deep Lymphatics and Glands of the Neck and Thorax. the Trapezius, where they are continuous with the axillary glands. A few small glands are also found on the front and sides of the larynx. The depp cervical glands (fig. 255) are numerous and of large size; they form an uninterrupted chain along the sheath of the cai'otid artery and internal jugular vein, lying by the side of the pharynx, oesophagus, and trachea, and extending from the base of the skull to the thorax, where they communicate with the lymphatic glands in that cavity. The superficial and deep cervical lymphatics are a continuation of those already described on the cranium and face. After traversing the glands Jin those regions, they pass through the chain of glands which lie along the sheath of the carotid

ADVERTISEMENT. It has been judged proper to place the nu- merous Engravings together in a separate Volume, as in this way they can be much more conveniently consulted. As ample Explanations of these Engrav- ings are given in the preceding Volumes, at those places where the subjects to which they refer are respectively discussed, it seems only necessary here to announce in general terms the subjects of the Plates, and to refer the Reader to the volume and page where they are more fully explained.

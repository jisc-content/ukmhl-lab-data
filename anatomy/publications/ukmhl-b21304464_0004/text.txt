ENGRAVINGS. EDINBURGH: PRINTED FOR ARCHIBALD CONSTABLE & CO EDINBURGH; AND LONGMAN, HURST, REES, ORME & BROWN, LONDON. 1813Null & Co. Printers, Edinburgh.ENGRAVINGS ILLUSTRATIVE OF DR MONRO’S OUTLINES of ANATOMY, BY HEATH, WOOLNOTH, ARCHIBALD, &c. AFTER ORIGINAL DRAWINGS OF MICHAEL ANGELO, DR F. CAMPER, MESSRS FYFE, SYME, &C.•TO JOHN FLAXMAN, Esq. PROFESSOR OF SCULPTURE TO THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF LONDON : Whose critical knowledge of the ancient languages; wnose intimate acquaintance with the elegant arts of Greece; whose unwearied application to Anatomical Studies, as connected with Sculpture ; have united in his Works the fire of the Poet, with the correct judgment of the Man of Science, and entitle Britain to hope that Antient Greece will not be unrivalled in chaste de- sign, and highly-finished execution : THIS FOURTH VOLUME IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED,\ 'ADVERTISEMENT. It has been judged proper to place the nu- merous Engravings together in a separate Volume, as in this way they can be much more conveniently consulted. As ample Explanations of these Engrav- ings are given in the preceding Volumes, at those places where the subjects to which they refer are respectively discussed, it seems only necessary here to announce in general terms the subjects of the Plates, and to refer the Reader to the volume and page where they are more fully explained.' ! i| .LIST of PLATES. Plate I. TP his plate was copied from a preparation of the human thigh-bone, which had been separated ar- tificially into its component layers; which lay- ers are composed of fibres. Vid. vol. i. p. 47. Plate II. The different figures of this plate, represent the course of the fibres of muscles ; a muscle with stiaight fibres, a semipenniform, penniform, and a compound penniform muscle are represented. In pages 105, 106 of vol. i. and the following pages, the effects of the direction of the fleshy fibres of the muscles are explained by my Father. VOL. IV. AOUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 2 Vid. vol. i. p. 177. • 1 Plate III. In this plate, there are several diagrams, in or- der to explain the effect of oblique muscles, and which are repeatedly referred to from pages 110. to 122. of vol. i. Plate IV. The several figures of this plate illustrate the ossification of the human patella ; the arteries of which, are much enlarged, and filled by arterial blood. Vid. vol. i. p. 177- Plate V. This plate points out the great number of ar- teries distributed upon a muscle, and their anas- tomoses. Vid. vol. i. p. 177. Plate VI. This plate represents the greater part of a very large exostosis, which grew from one of the me- tacarpal bones of the fingers.LIST of PLATES. O Vid. vol. i. p. 178. l ' . Plate VII. The drawing from which this engraving was taken, was copied from a case of a cancer of the tibia. Vid. vol. i. p. 178. Plate VIII. This plate represents the bones of the arm of a young boy, that were affected by the disease call- ed spina ventosa, which disease has been fully de- scribed by my Grandfather. Vid. vol. i. p. 144. Plate IX. This plate represents several bones which had been cast off in consequence of the disease called necrosis ; and in order to render the nature of it more obvious to the student, several examples have been given.OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 4 Vid. vol. i. p. 180. Plate X. This plate represents pieces of the under jaw, which had been cast off by necrosis, the places of which, were supplied by new bone. Vid. vol. i. p. 178. Plate. XI. The figure in this plate was taken from a thigh- bone, which had been very much enlarged. Vid. vol. i. p. 178. Plate XII. This plate was copied from a portion of a rickety skull, which had attained a very unusual . thickness. Vid. vol. i. p. 178. Plate XIII. This plate represents a fractured collar-bone, which had been very ill set, for the fractured ends of the bones cross each other.LIST OF PLATES. 5 Vid. vol. i. p. 376. Plate XIV. This plate represents a compound fracture of the radius and ulna, which had been ill-treated. Vid. vol. i. p. 180. Plate XV. This plate, taken from a drawing by the cele- brated Dr P. Camper, exhibits the different angles formed by the ossa pubis of an European, an Asiatic, a lame person, and of an Ethiopian. Vid. vol. i. p. 235. Plate XVI. This plate represents outlines of the skullcaps of five British skulls, in order to point out the dif- ferences in their form. Vid. vol. i. p. 353. Plate XVII. This plate is a fac simile of a drawing of a profile of a skull by that celebrated anatomist and draughtsman Dr P. Camper, and affords an ex- cellent illustration of the freedom and accuracy of the pencil of that great man.OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Plate XVlII. The figures in this engraving, were copied from a British skull, from that of a Turk, and of a Russian ; they are of the natural size, that their distinctive characters might be obvious, and they are placed in such a manner, as to exhibit the differences not only of the form of the cranium, but also those of the bones of the face. Vid. vol. i. p. 377. Plate XIX. This plate represents the skulls of a Hindoo, an Esquimaux, and a Negro. . Vid. vol. i. p. 378. Plate XX. This plate represents the skull of a Carib of the Island of St Vincent, the skull of a New Hol- lander, and that of a mummy. The first of these has been distorted in conse- quence of pressure artificially applied to the fore- head. The third figure represents the most singular skull which I have seen in point of shape; it is the skull of a mummy, which is preserved in theLIST OF PLATES. 7 Museum of Natural History of Edinburgh, and measures no less than eight inches and three quar- ters from the os frontis to the occiput: it is, at the same time, remarkably narrow, measuring across the os frontis, from side to side, only three inches and three quarters. It may not be improper to add, that since the description of the above skull was printed, I have had an opportunity, through the kindness of Mr Planta, of examining the skulls of three mum- mies, which are preserved in the British Museum : and it is a curious and interesting fact in the his- tory of mankind, that these three skulls are not only widely different from the skull I have re- presented, but also from each other. Vid. a further description of the figures of skulls, vol. i. p. 378, & 379. Plate XX. A. This Plate represents the base of the skull of a Carib of the Island of St Vincent, which was no less distorted in its base, than in its upper part. Ihe figure of the instrument for measuring skulls, is also represented in this engraving. Vid. vol. i. p. 380. Plate XXI. This figure was copied from the skull of a child that died from hydrocephalus, and shews in a very A 4OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. $ distinct manner the singular effect of that disease in altering the form of the skull. Vid. observations on hydrocephalus chronicus, vol. i. p. 365. &■ seq. Plate XXII. This plate, which is a fac simile of a beautiful drawing by Michael Angelo, represents the muscles of the chest, and superior extremities in ac- tion ; and is no less remarkable for its accuracy, than for the grandeur of the design. Vid. vol. i. p. 452. &■ p. 456. Plate XXIII. This plate represents the skull of an old man, engraved by my friend Dr Hardie of Manches- ter, which is designed to point out the differences between the skull of the old and the young, and more particularly the great prominence of the under jaw-bone of the former. Vid. vol. ii. p. 28. Plate XXIV. This plate represents the constrictors of the pharynx, and a packet of longitudinal muscu- lar fibres; which, as far as I know, has not been described by any anatomical author.LIST OF PLATES. 9 Vid. vol. ii. p. 173. The two strata of muscular fibres of the gullet, •are also represented in the same plate. Vid. vol. ii. p. 46. Plate XXV. This plate represents the internal membrane of the gullet lined by cuticle, which cuticle I could not trace farther than the cardia. This plate was originally published in my Thesis De Dysphagia; Sir Everard Home in his excellent paper on the Structure of the Sto- machs of different Animals, published in the Lon- don Phil. Transact, for 1807, has also represented the cuticle terminating at the cardia. Vid. vol. ii. p. 47. Plate XXVI. This plate represents seven salivary concre- tions. Vid. vol. ii. p. 15 8. Plate XXVII. This plate represents the effects of the camp dysentery upon the intestines. The original drawing was made under the immediate direction of my late uncle Dr D. Monro.10 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Plate XXVIII. This plate represents the disease I have named fungus of the villous coat of the stomach ; the coats of which, were very much thickened in the vicinity of the pylorus. The drawing was very faithful, having been executed by that excellent artist Mr P. Syme. Vid. vol. ii. p. 180. Plate XXIX. In this plate, a large internal hernia, which was situated immediately behind the upper abdominal aperture is represented. The colon passed into the tumour, and was so firmly fixed within, that I could not withdraw it, until I had slit up the sac. A portion of omentum was also lodged within the sac, and had attained an extraordinary bulk. This kind of hernia has not, as far as I know, been represented or described. Vid. vol. ii. p. 193. Plate XXX. This figure was taken from a preparation, in which a portion of the ileum had been strangu-LIST OF PLATES. 11 lated by passing through an unnatural aperture in the mesentery. Vid. vol. ii. P- 202. Plate XXXI. The figures of this plate are intended to illus- trate the structure of the pancreas, which is re- presented of its natural size, and also as seen un- der a glass of high magnifying powers. Vid. vol. ii. p. 239* Plate XXXII. In this plate, six biliary concretions are repre- sented. Vid. vol. ii. p. 282. Plate XXXIII. In this figure, a large true aneurism of the arch of the aorta is represented. The tumour compressed the left branch of the windpipe and also the gullet. Vid. vol. ii. p. 377. Plate XXXIV. An aneurism of a very peculiar kind is exhibit- ed in this plate.12 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY* Vid. vol. iii. Appendix.- The whole aorta was very much enlarged, and there was also a large tumour connected with the side of it, which adhered to the breast-bone. Vid. vol. ii. p. 378. Plate XXXV. This plate was copied from a case, in which there was an enlargement of the aorta, and an en- largement and ossification of the coronary arteries of the heart. Vid. vol. ii. p. 378. Plate XXXVI. This plate is intended to illustrate the structure of the kidney, and especially of its papillae. Vid. vol. iii. p. 5. Plate XXXVII. This plate represents urinary concretions, whick were taken from the kidney. Vid. vol. iii. Appendix. Plate XXXVIII. This plate represents urinary concretions.13 LIST OF PLATES.

In this plate, copied from a drawing by Hopfer, the seminiferous tubes of the testicle are repre-r sented, as also those of the epididymis. Vid. vol. iii. p. 50. Plate XL. This plate represents an unusual variety of stricture, combined with fistula in perineo. Vid. vol. iii. p. 35. Plate XLI. In this engraving, the coats of the eye are re- presented ; as also Petit’s Canal.14 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Plate XLII. The figures in this plate, give views of the dis- tribution of the smaller ramifications of the por- tio mollis upon the gyri of the cochlea of the ear. Vid. vol. iii. p. 1^3. Plate XLIII. The object of this- plate, is to exhibit a devia- tion from the usual distribution of the great ar- teries, which take their rise from the arch of the aorta. Vid. vol. iii. p. 378. Plate XLIV. In the three figures of this plate, irregularities with respect to the course of the branches of the humeral artery, are represented. Vid. vol. iii. p. 304. Plate XLV. The object of this plate, is to represent the re- lative situation of the subcutaneous nerves at the elbow-joint, in respect to the subcutaneous veins. Vi^. vol. iii. p. 318.IS LIST OF PLATES. Vid. vol. iii. p. 318. Plate XLVI. in this plate, an unusual distribution of the yeins of the elbow-joint is represented.Plate.

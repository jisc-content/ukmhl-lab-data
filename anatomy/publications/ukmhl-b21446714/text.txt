CATHCART CONSERVATOR : FELLOW OF THE COLLEGE Vol. I-THE SKELETON AND ORGANS OF MOTION PRINTED AT THE EDINBURGH PRESS, 9 & 11 YOUNG STREET PUBLISHED BY JAMES THIN, EDINBURGH 1893 PRICE SEVEN SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCEPREFACE. The Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh dates from about the end of last century. Although the specimens were only formally entered in the General Catalogue about 1807, many of those afterwards added had been collected before that time. Under the fostering care of Eobert Knox, W. M'Gillivray, John Goodsir, H. Lee, W. Sanders, J. Bell Pettigrew, and E. Blair Cunynghame, the general collection has steadily increased by donations of individual specimens and prepara- tions, but it has also been enriched from time to time by collections formed by private persons. Of these, the most important is the "Bell Collection," which will be afterwards referred to, but many others must also be mentioned. Thus there were the CoEections formed by one of the CoUege Professors of Surgery, an office now obsolete, Professor John Thomson, and those formed by Messrs James Eussell, after- wards Professor in the University of Edinburgh, and Eobert Allan; the Series of Urinary and Biliary Calculi collected by Dr William Newbigging; the admirable Dental Collection formed by Mr Nasmyth; and the preparations, casts, and instruments illustrating Ophthalmic Surgery collected by Mr William Walker. In more recent years Dr C. E. Underhill presented his Midwifery Museum to the College, and Drvi Preface. Thomas Keith, on leaving Edinburgh for London, handed over to the Conservator a Series of Tumours illustrating his work in Abdominal Surgery. Dr Bryan C. Waller has presented to the College a collection of Specimens illustrating Medical Pathology, which he purchased from Dr Eutherford Haldane. Besides these, there have been added other smaller collec- tions, to which it does not seem necessary to refer in detail. The " Bell Collection " * was purchased from Mr, afterwards * The following account of the Bell Museum was published in 1819, while it was still in Great Windmill Street, London. Although many additions were made to it in the subsequent six years, the account is valuable aa a record of the mode of formation of the Museum :— " The formation of this Museum may be divided into three periods— that formed by Mr Wilson, that formed by Mr Bell, and the addition made during the last seven years. "Mr Bell's original Collection consisted of preparations, both of Natural and Morbid Anatomy. It was particularly valuable in Quicksilver Preparations; in Preparations of the Lymphatics; in Diseased Bones; in Diseases of the Bladder and Urethra; and in Models of Diseased Viscera. "The Collection of Mr Wilson was remarkable for the exquisitely neat manner in which the preparations had been dissected and preserved. Its value was principally in the complete Series of Preparations, exhibiting the Minute Structure, and arranged so as to correspond with the Lecture?. These must always form an important part of the Present Museum from their intrinsic value, as well as from the Maker, who learned his art under the celebrated Mr Cruickshank (the fine Collection of Mr Cruickshank was bought by the Empress of Russia), the Colleague of Dr Hunter. "By the arrangement betwixt Mr Wilson and Mr Bell, Mr Wilson's Preparations became the property of the latter, and the two Collections were united. Since that period, that is, in the last seven years, great additions have been made (not less than one-third of the whole). To the pupils of that period, it is not necessary to say that this has been done principally through the labours of Mr Shaw. Mr Shaw was a pupil of Mr Bell's at a very early age, and has continued making Preparations under him for eleven years."Preface. v Sir Charles.. Bell in 1825, and is now incorporated in the general collection, of which it forms a very valuable part. Most of the specimens referred to in Sir Charles Bell's published works are thus to be found in this Museum. In this way it happens that besides the actual specimens which his keen interest in all physiological and pathological questions led him to preserve, we have in many instances the advantage of a description of their clinical history from his graphic pen, and sketches of their clinical appearances from his still more graphic pencil. The "Barclay Collection," chiefly of Human and Comparative Anatomy Specimens, forms a part of the Museum of the Koyal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, but by the deed of presentation it is kept separate from the rest and stands in a Hall by itself. It contains a few Pathological Specimens, but these unfortunately cannot be used to enrich the General Collec- tion, although in one or two instances casts of the specimens have been made for that purpose. The former printed Catalogue of the Museum was compiled by Dr M'Gillivray, afterwards Professor of Zoology in Aberdeen, and was published in 1836. It included all the Specimens, Casts, and Drawings then in the Museum illustrating Pathology, but none of those illustrating Human or Com- parative Anatomy. The present Catalogue has been very carefully drawn up with the express purpose of making the Collection practically useful to students and members of the Medical Profession. An erroneous view of pathological Museums — altogetherviii Preface. foreign to that of our Museum founders—is unfortunately common, namely, that they are collections of mere pathological curiosities, the study of which is something quite different from that of practical Medicine and Surgery. It is needless to say that this is an entire misconception, for a properly arranged Museum obviously offers an insight into the varieties and con- sequences of injury, and into the natural history of disease, which clinical study alone cannot supply. The object held in view, therefore, in classifying, arranging, and describing the specimens for the present Volume, has been to bring them into line with clinical work. This has required so much re-arrangement and re-description of the specimens in the Museum, that the present is essentially a new Catalogue rather than a second edition of the old one. Various illustrations of General Pathology form the first Series. The specimens it contains illustrate certain aspects of Hypertrophy and Atrophy, of Inflammation, Degeneration, and Repair, which could, not otherwise be so well compared. Every effort, however, has been made to limit it, and it does not include Tumours, for reasons that will be afterwards explained. In the Specimens illustrating special Pathology the larger Classes have been formed upon the usual Physiological basis, and are such as "the Skeleton and Organs of Motion," the affections of which occupy the present volume; also " the Ali- mentary Canal," "the Respiratory System," and others, which will be taken up in a subsequent volume or volumes. Within the first Class there have been formed three Divi- sions-^. (1) the Bones and Joints; (2) Muscles and Tendons,Preface,. ix Synovial Sheaths, Bursas, and Fasciae, and Connective Tissue; and (3) " the Limbs as a whole." The specimens thus included have been formed into ten Series (see general Analysis). The Series are numbered consecutively throughout the divisions of the first Class, and it is intended to carry on the numbers of the succeeding Series continuously through the Classes and Divi- sions which have yet to follow. Within each Series, however, the numbers of the individual Specimens begin anew. In the Bell Collection, a Series of specimens illustrating the normal structure of each organ preceded those illustrating its abnormal conditions. This method was discarded when the previous Catalogue was drawn up, but has now been re - adopted. The same principle has moreover been carried out among the individual Pathological specimens, where a still closer proximity of the normal and abnormal seemed advantageous. Nothing need be said about the mode of subdividing the first five Series, but of that employed in the sixth—"Diseases of Bone"—some explanation seems advisable, especially as, with certain modifications, it has been applied to the Series which follow. Under the general title " Diseases of Bone " four main groups have been recognised, i.e. I. Abnormalities in growth or development, which are chiefly, of course, congenital; II. Altera- tions due to local or general affections of Nutrition; III. Inflammatory Diseases; and IV. Tumours or New Growths. The subdivisions of the first and second of these groups may be sufficiently studied in the General Analysis; but of those of the third group—i.e., Inflammations—a short explanation may not be out of place. The view of Inflammation whichx Preface,. underlies the classification here adopted, is that enunciated by Lister* in 1858, and emphasised afterwards by Cohnheim, Burdon Sanderson, and others, namely, that Inflammation is not so much a disease in itself as a consequence of inter- ference with the vitality of the tissues. Causation of Inflammation has therefore been chosen as the basis of primary subdivision, and the modes of interference with vitality, or causes of Inflammation, are thus the distinguishing features of the larger groups. Although it is difficult to conceive how much we may still have to learn on this subject, the knowledge acquired in recent years seems sufficient to justify the plan adopted, even should it require to be afterwards modified. As it stands, this plan carries with it at least two distinct advantages. Museum specimens are by its means arranged in accordance with present clinical and pathological knowledge. This is obvious, but in addition the confusion which has so frequently arisen from a " cross classification" has been avoided. Such headings as " Necrosis," " Periostitis," and " Syphilis " are commonly used as co-ordinate yet distinct subdivisions of bone disease; but as the first indicates " result," the second " locality," and the third " causation," the groups are not mutually exclusive, and uncertainty and con- fusion is the necessary consequence. The place for " result" as a basis of subdivision of diseased bones seems to be within each of the larger;groups formed upon the basis of "causa- tion," to which it thus becomes of subsidiary importance. In the case of Syphilitic diseases of bone, those of the * Philosophical Transactions, 1858.Preface. xi Skull have been kept separate from those of the rest of the skeleton; but with this exception, " locality " has not been used as a basis of subdivision in this Series. Never- theless, an examination of the groups formed will show that " locality" has accompanied the " results " due to the various " causes " in a remarkably close way. Thus there are various forms of necrosis, caries, and enlargement, depending upon different causes, and showing corresponding differences, but also locating themselves mainly in different bones, or forms of bone tissue. " Locality " might therefore have been used as subsidiary to " result" through all the groups of bone disease had it seemed necessary. Among joints, on the other hand, "locality" has been considered of more importance, and has been used to divide and subdivide the specimens ranged under the various causes of Inflammation. In every case we must remember that "the division must be founded upon one principle or basis," i.e., " some quality or circumstance," which, in order to be taken as the basis of sub-division, "must be present with some and absent with others, or must vary with the different species comprehended in the genus."* What that basis is will depend upon the general character of the specimens, the state of knowledge at the time the classification is made, and the judgment of the classifier. It is true that some forms of cross-classification still remain, but while they seem inevitable, they are less likely to confuse than those now excluded. Thus, for example, many diseases of joints affect chiefly the bones; compound fracture may lead to * Jevons' "Elementary Lessons in Loijic," 1893, p. 105.xii Preface. disease of bone; and, again, many diseases of stumps are really only diseases of the bone. In such cases the specimens have been placed in what seemed the more important group, and representative specimens, or cross references, have been put in the other group to which they may be considered also to belong. The subdivision of the fourth group, Tumours, or New (Growths, is based upon the view that they are essentially modi- fications of growth, and not merely responses to irritation; further, that they take their type from the tissue from which they arise, and that they vary in their rate of growth and degree of malignancy. Consequently, no attempt has been made to form a general group of "Tumours," but instead, each Pathological Series has its department for "Tumours," just as it has for " Inflammations " of various kinds. The order in which the' individual specimens have been arranged within the groups has been based upon the following general principles. Among Fractures the larger groups have, as is usual, been based upon "locality," i.e., the bone, or special part of it which has been broken. Within the groups thus formed, the speci- mens have been classed as recent, and of old standing, and the latter again as united or ununited. Other groups of injuries have been similarly treated. Among Malformations, the lesser degrees have been placed before those more pronounced. In Inflammations, early stages of disease have been placed before those more advanced, in order to illustrate the successive phases of the particular malady. These have been followed,Preface. xiii when possible, by others, illustrating spontaneous cure, and lastly, by those which show the results of operations. Among Tumours a study of the clinical history and naked- eye appearances seems a better foundation for their arrangement in a Museum than their microscopical characters. Consequently, the Tumours of any particular tissue or organ will be found to range from the simple, well-developed, slow-growing forms to those which grow quickly, are undefined in structure, and are clinically malignant. The microscopical characters of any specimen have been looked upon as an adjunct to its descrip- tion rather than as an essential element in its classification. It follows, as a natural consequence from the above method of arrangement, that all the contents of the Museum which represent a certain degree of deformity, stage of disease, or kind of tumour have been grouped together. Formerly, in this as in many other Museums, spirit preparations were placed in one part of the Museum, dried preparations in another, casts in a third, and drawings in a fourth. Now, they are all classed together in the Catalogue when they belong to the same or to similar specimens. Where, owing to variations in shape and size, some of the individual members of a group could not be conveniently placed upon the shelves with the rest, every effort has been made to place them so close to the others that the student can refer to them without loss either of time, or of a sense of the general continuity. In many cases published drawings of the patients from whom the specimens were taken have been copied by photography and placed beside the specimens they illustrate.xiv Preface. Each specimen is furnished with its Series-number, fol- lowed in smaller type by its own number within the Series. These numbers are of course repeated in the Catalogue. The plan of giving to the description of each specimen a general heading in bold type has been adopted from Sir George Humphry's Catalogue of the Cambridge Museum and from the revised edition of the Catalogue of Guy's Hospital Museum. 'This heading is followed in the same paragraph by a state- ment of what the specimen is, and by an account of how it has been prepared and mounted. Next comes the clinical history in small print. Every effort has been made to obtain these histories of the specimens. The various manuscript Catalogues contain many, which were either not used at all, or only briefly abstracted in the previous Catalogue. These have now been largely drawn upon. In addition, every available clue has been followed that promised to lead to a clinical account of any of the specimens, whether in the old Infirmary records, or in the published writings of the donors of the specimens. It is to be regretted that this has been possible with only a limited number of the specimens, and it may be assumed that where no clinical history is given, none has been accessible to the present conservator.' In natural sequence after this paragraph, follow, in larger type, the descriptions of the speci- mens in their recent state (when obtainable), and as they are permanently to be seen in the Museum. Last of all are added such comments as seemed desirable. Before the donor's name, the Manuscript Catalogue number has been given to facilitate further reference if required. G.C.Preface. xv means the General Manuscript Catalogue, in which all speci- mens presented to the Museum are entered, unless they have formed part of a collection provided with a separate Catalogue. B.C. refers to the MS. Catalogue of the "Bell Collection;" and W.C. refers to the MS. Wilson Catalogue. Although the specimens in the " Wilson " Collection were transferred to the " Bell," it has been considered better in the case of important pathological specimens to refer when possible to the original source of information. A considerable number of the speci- mens described in the former printed Catalogue had not been entered in any other. This is specially true of those presented by Professor John Thomson. They are referred to now as F. P. C. (Former Printed Catalogue), followed by the corre- sponding number. When the date of the presentation of any specimen to the Museum is not stated, an approximation to the date may be obtained from the following general statement as to the entries in the General Manuscript Catalogue :•—The numbers had reached to 805 in 1826, to 1216 in 1830, to 2272 in 1842, to 2415 in 1857, to 2467 in 1865, and to 2764 in 1886. The Conservator wishes here to record his thanks to the Presidents and Council of the College and to the Members of the Museum Committee for the hearty encouragement which they have given to him throughout his work for the present volume. He would be very ungrateful, too, if he were to forget to mention another to whom his thanks are especially due. Tentative arrangements and re-arrangements of the specimens have, of course, been required : taking down and re-mountingxvj Preface. the specimens for careful examination has also been frequent. In all this the Conservator feels it but right to say that his work has been greatly facilitated by the manipulative skill and ingenuity, by the exactness and conscientious care, and perhaps, most of all, by the unfailing patience and goodwill, of his able assistant Mr George Eeid.V £kky of PRESENTED ERWEST HAhT Eeq GENERAL ANALYSIS GENEEAL PATHOLOGY.

Enlargement of Mamma in a Pregnant Woman.— Sections of two mammary glands—in spirit—to show the difference between the suckling and the non-suckling condition of that organ. The larger portion is from the breast of a woman who died after an operation for extra-uterine pregnancy at full time. The smaller and more fibrous-looking portion is from the breast of a non-pregnant woman, aged about 26 years. The enlargement in the pregnant mamma is due to the extra development of the acini forming the epithelial portion of the breast. This is perceptible not only on the surface, but also on the section, where the masses of epithelium show of an opaque yellow colour, surrounded by fibrous tissue- G. C. 3164 and 3101a.

COMPENSATORY, i.e. FROM ARTIFICIALLY INCREASED DEMAND ON FUNCTION. 1. 4. Hypertrophy of Bladder Wall associated with old- standing Stricture of the Urethra-Preparation of bladder, part of penis, and urethra. The bladder and prostatic portion of urethra are opened from above. The prostatic abscess, and the membranous and spongy parts of the urethra, are opened from below. The patient who had suffered from stricture for some years, ^d been • Z habi^ oTparsin, soft bougies on himself. Two days before his death iVhad^ "i* *«* ^ (PIObably fr°m extravasation of urine). Above the stricture, which was very narrow and plugged by a calculus, the urethral mucous membrane is dilated, ulcerated, and covered with "calculous" (phosphatic) deposit. The prostate has become an abscess cavity communicating with the urethra. A thick white rod shows where the urine had escaped into the cellular tissue of the penis and scrotum. Smaller white rods indicate the ureters. B. C. xiv. 1. M. 4i. i Hvnertrophy of Fibula from Strain.-Plaster cast of a 1 5' SK^- of ununited fracture of the tibia which is in the Barclay Collection. There has been an ununited fracture of the tibia, with a Mse joint. The fibula is much bent, and is at the same f ree „teatly thickened, especially at the concavrty and at the Convexity of the curve. These changes have evidently b en I result of an increased strain on the oivin^ tojhe ununited fracture of the tibia.Hypertrophy. 3 1. 6. Thickening of the Capsular Ligament of the Hip- joint from Strain.—Upper end of the right femur of an old person,—in spirit—showing an ununited fracture of the neck, and changes consequent thereon. The soft parts are cleared off, excepting the ligamentous attachment round the hip. The patient, a man aged 70 years, lived for fifteen months after ■receipt of an intra-capsular fracture of the neck of the femur. The neck of the bone has been greatly absorbed, and the broken surfaces are smoothed and slightly hollowed out. Bands of newly-formed fibrous tissue unite the detached head to the capsule and to the neck. The thickening of the capsule is very manifest. G. C. 1478. Presented by Prof. "W. R. Turner and Alexander Watson, F.R.C.S.E., 1834. i. 7. Thickening- of Epidermis from Pressure and Friction. —Longitudinal section of the left foot of a man,—in spirit— showing changes in the epithelium of the heel and ball of the toes. Owing to a severe compound fracture of the Tibia in his youth, the patient had for 30 years been unable to walk on his heel. He had therefore borne his weight on the fore part of his foot. The thickness of the epidermis below the balls of the toes is much greater than that below the heel. This condition is the reverse of what is found when the tread is normal. G. C. 3130. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E., 1889. 1. 8. Hypertrophy of Kidney.—This preparation consists of bladder, a sound kidney on one side, and a shrivelled one on the other, from an adult man,—in spirit. The bladder is laid open from above. The patient died of some complaint unconnected with the kidneys, and their condition was only accidentally observed at the post-mortem examination. The right kidney is not much larger than the prostate gland, and is calcareous and shrivelled, this most probably beingGeneral Pathology. 4 the result of tubercular disease, spontaneously cured. The left kidney is about twice the size of an ordinary one, but seems to be normal in structure. JSTo doubt the enlargement has followed the increased demand upon its functions from the destruction of the other kidney. G. C. 3229. Presented by Harvey Littlejohn, F.R.C.S.E., 1890. FROM IRRITATION OF VARIOUS KINDS. 1.9. Periostitic Bone Formation near Septic Necrosis.— Lower portion of the stump of a femur, in which there has been necrosis—macerated and dried. The patient, a girl set. 15 years, had suffered amputation through the thigh some time before the specimen was obtained. The lower end of the bone shows one distinct necrosis, with a smaller spicule of necrosis near it. The end of the medullary cavity has been closed in Avith bone, and a complete shell of periosteal bone surrounds the original shaft. This shell is thick at its lower end and along the anterior aspect of the femur. G. C. 313S. 1. 10. Thickening- of Ribs from Empyema.—Section of two ribs, with a portion of a greatly thickened pleura, showing the above changes. In consequence of prolonged empyema the pleura has been greatly thickeued, and along with this a considerable growth of bone has taken place on the surface of the ribs next the , pleura. G. C. 3074.

Millee, F.R.C.S.E., 1892. 1. 12. Hypertrophy of Bone due to Mechanical Irritation. —Bones of the fore-limb of a fox, in which a wire loop has been embedded by the formation of new bone round it. The specimen was obtained from the leg of an adult fox, which had been recently killed. '' The skin was perfectly healed up, and there was no mark exter- nally, except a narrow line of yellow hair round the black part of the paw, showing where the skin had been cut by the wire. It is evident that the animal had got his foot entangled in a snare set for rabbits, that he had first drawn it so tight as to cut through the flesh to the bone, and then had succeeded in breaking the wire" (letter from donor). From the comparative smoothness of the new bone, the condition must have been one of long standing. No doubt at first there must have been much inflammation, and that probably septic. G.

Hypertrophy of Subcutaneous Fat on Anterior Abdominal Wall.—Section of the anterior abdominal wall of an elderly woman, near the linea alba. The specimen shows a very large hypertrophy of subcu- taneous fat, and slightly, also, of subperitoneal fat, while the skin and fascial structures remain quite thin. G. C. 3077.

Congenital Hypertrophy of Finger.—Cast in glycerine6 General Pathology. and gelatine, of a case of congenital hypertrophy of the hand and fore-arm of an infant girl aged 20 months showing enlarge- ment of the middle finger. The finger had been unusually large at birth, and had afterwards increased still more out of proportion to the others. It was amputated by Dr Joseph Bell the day after the cast was made. The finger is about one-third longer and three or four times thicker than the others. The end of the finger is about the same girth as the infant's wrist. G. C. 2731. Presented by Charles W. Cathoart, F.R.C.S.E., 1884. 1.15. Congenital Hypertrophy of Finger.—The amputated finger, of which the foregoing specimen is a cast.

The animal when shot was eating a leaf with its back teeth, and was well nourished. ~ The right lower incisor has been accidentally broken on after death. The left lower incisor projects forwards and curves7 Atrophy. slightly upwards. Its upper and outer surface is worn by the inner surface of the upper incisor of the same side. The right upper incisor has curved round upon itself, and by pressure has caused absorption of the left upper jaw, which it has in this way penetrated. An additional ill-developed incisor lies behind it. The left upper incisor—though also overgrown—is shorter than its fellow, and has rubbed against the side of the left lower incisor. An additional incisor lies behind this tooth, and is shorter than the additional incisor of the right side. The first right lower molar has had no exactly opposing tooth, and has, in its overgrowth, penetrated into the upper jaw. A certain amount of overgrowth is also seen in the first and second right upper molars, and in the first left lower molar. G. C. 3115. Presented by A. Allen, L.R.C.S., 1889. ATROPHY.

The muscles, of the foot are all more or less atrophied. The extensor brevis digitorum, when fresh, was especially pale in colour. It is also diminished in hulk, and its tendons are reduced almost to threads. G. C. 3135. Presented by A. G. Millee, F.E.C.S.E., 1890. 1. 25. Atrophy of Optic Nerve following" Destruction of the Eyeball.—Preparation—in spirit—consisting of optic tracts, commissure, and nerves, with the eyeballs, one shrunken, show- ing changes in the nerve of the affected eyeball. The appearance of the shrunken eyeball indicates long- standing destruction, and the optic nerve on the same side is much smaller than its fellow. The sheath of the nerve, in each case, has been dissected off at a corresponding point. G. C. 3193. 1. 26. Atrophy from Excessive Use. Specimen required. 1. 27.

Absorption of Vertebrae from Aneurismal Pressure. —Section of the bodies of three dorsal vertebra;, from a case of aneurism,—in spirit.10 General Pathology. There is considerable hollowing out on the front of the vertebra?, and, as is usual in such cases, the bones have suffered more than the intervertebral discs, which stand out still com- paratively unchanged. The substance of the bones seems quite normal beyond the absorbed portion. G. C. 3103. 1. 30. Absorption of Vertebra from Pressure in Lateral Curvature.—Lower four cervical and upper nine dorsal vertebra, from a case of lateral curvature—macerated. In the concavity of the arch formed by the seventh, eighth, and ninth vertebras on the left side, the bodies have been compressed, and are in consequence much less in depth there than on the other side, where there is a convexity. This is due to the greater compression which always exists upon the concavity of an arch, as when a piece of wood is bent upon itself. G- C- 1637' Presented bij P.

Increased Vascularity of an Inflamed Part-Cast in gelatine and glycerine of a left hand, showing a condition of onychia-probably septic and tubercnlar-in a child aged 9 or 10 years. . Several months before the cast was taken the nail had been Wed in a gate, and the finger had remained inflamed.11 Inflammation. The redness and swelling round the end of the finger may be taken as illustrating an acute inflammation. It was, however, an acute exacerbation rather than a simple acute inflammation. The increased size of the nail indicates the previously congested condition of the parts, and may be taken as an instance of overgrowth from increased vascularity. G. C. 3125. Presented by Charles W.

Specimen required. 1. 39. Organization of Effused Lymph.—Loop of bowel and mesentery, with organising lymph on the surface—injected. Nine months before death (from strangulated hernia) patient had suffered from an attack of localised peritonitis from which he seemed to have completely recovered. It is easy to see on the surface of the mesentery, and extending from that on to the intestine on both sides, strands of developing connective tissue, which have been injected at places, and which must have begun in recent lymph effused during the previous attack of peritonitis.

Wound of Skin and of Peritoneum healed by First Intention.—Portion of the anterior abdominal wall, at and near the middle line, about 14 days after an abdominal operation. The patient was a young man, upon whom laparotomy was performed for intestinal obstruction, caused by a band. The band was divided, and the obstruction successfully relieved. Two weeks afterwards, however, the obstruction returned, owing to adhesions forming at the seat of the previous obstruction. A second operation was performed, but the patient died a few hours afterwards. The peritoneal wound has so completely healed that it is now impossible to say that any such wound had existed. The skin wound is also healed, but the recent epidermis has somewhat peeled off, and by its puckering shows where the wound was. Q, Q. 3320. Presented by Charles "W.

Repair in Artery.—Portion of a large artery, probably the femoral, laid open some days after a ligature,—in spirit. The artery had been ligatured with silk, the ends of which are shown hanging down. At and near the point of ligature lymph has been effused, and extending up from the ligature there is a long narrow clot. The interior of the artery is marked by ridges, caused by changes in the middle coat. G. C. 3152. 1. 47. Repair in Viscera.— Specimen required. HEALING BY . SECOND INTENTION. 1. 48. Granulating Ulcer.—Gelatine and glycerine cast of an ulcer of the leg, healing by granulation. The ulcer had been caused by an extensive burn. The healing process went on rapidly up to a point, but at the time the cast was taken the process had become sluggish, although still progressing. The granulations are somewhat oedematous and raised above the level of the surrounding skin. The characteristics are otherwise those of a healing ulcer. G. C. 2883. Presented by Charles "W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1889. 1. 49. Granulating Ulcer.-Finger and part of hand covered by granulations after a burn, artificially injected with gum and vermilion,—in spirit. The patient, when drunk, had fallen into the fire. His hands had been so severely burned that both required to be amputated. The irregular, granular appearance of the surface and its great vascularity are well brought out. The end of the finger has become gangrenous, and the necrosed end of the second phalanx is seen projecting through the soft parts. The last two joints of the fingers had been quite gangrenous,15 Repair of Injuries. but over the first phalanx and metacarpal bone the subcutaneous tissue had been exposed, and has become covered with granu- lations. These are seen to be small irregular swellings, containing numerous blood-vessels, which have been freely injected. The section shows that the vascularity is much greater in the outer than in the inner parts. G. C. 3075. Presented by John Duncan, F.R.C.S.E., 1889. 1. 50. Sear after Healing* by Granulation.—Portion of skin which has formed the face of a stump, which had healed up by granulation,—in spirit.

The patient had been burned in childhood. The chin is brought down upon the sternum, and the lower lip has been pulled away from the mouth. Owing to the loss of support usually given by the lower lip to the lower incisor teeth, these have been pushed forward by the pressure of the tongue from within. G. 0. 3166.

FEACTUEES OF THE SKULL. FISSURED FRACTURES. 3. 1. Fissured Fracture of both Parietal Bones. — Calvarium of an elderly person—macerated—showing the above fracture, and two trephine openings on the right side. The patient had fallen from a great height. When taken to the surgeon he was insensible, and had an extensive effusion of blood over the right parietal bone. "When the bone was exposed by an incision a fissure was seen, and first the posterior, then the anterior trephine hole was made in the hope of relieving pressure from blood clot. However, '' the patient continued to snort in a state of complete insensibility, and died." On the right side the fissures radiate in three directions from about the centre of the parietal eminence. The widest fissure runs down to the centre of the squamous suture. Another fissure, more on the outer than on the inner table, runs forward to the coronal suture, while the third, running back- wards over the trephine openings, does not extend beyond the posterior one. On the left side a fissure runs from above the parietal eminence towards the posterior inferior angle of the bone. B. C. 1. 2. M. 1. 3.2. Fissured Fracture of the Frontal and Parietal40 Injuries of Bone. Bones.—Calvarium of an elderly person—macerated—to show the fissured fracture as above. The injury was inflicted on the upper part of the cranium. On the right side the fissure has traversed the coronal suture and has then passed into the parietal bone. On the left side on the posterior part of the frontal bone there is a fissure more extensive on the inner than on the outer table. B- C- L 2" M- 3- 3. 3. Fracture of Calvarium with Sub-dural Haemorrhage.— ' Calvarium of an old person—macerated—with dura mater and blood clot between it and the bone modelled in position, in wax. The bone was trephined and the greater part of the coagulum removed with a teaspoon, but the patient died of concussion. Several fissures cross the course of the right middle meningeal artery. It must have been ruptured. B. C. 1. 2.

The patient was working at the Forth Bridge, and fell from a height, striking his left temple. He was brought to the Infirmary, where he shortly afterwards died. . . At the post-mortem examination there was scarcely any injury to the brain on the left side, but on the right side there was great lacera- tion by contre-coup, of the temporo-sphenoidal and frontal lobes, and from this he must have died.

As noted in the previous specimen, the injury was received on the left side. This is therefore an illustration of injury to the brain by contre-coup. The under and lateral surfaces of the temporo-sphenoidal and frontal lobes are severely lacerated on the right side, while on the left side they are apparently unharmed, except for slight superficial haemorrhages on the frontal lobe, below the points where the bone was broken. G-. C. 2831. Presented by Professor T. Annandale. 3. 6. Longitudinal Fissure of Calvarium.— Calvarium — macerated—from an elderly person, showing longitudinal fracture through the right parietal and frontal bones. The symptoms were obscure, and the fracture was not recognised during life. Apparently another fracture below the fissure has been present, but the loose piece has not been preserved. G. C. 1130. Presented by Sir Geobge Ballingall. 3. 7. Fracture of the Base of the Skull.—Skull—macerated —with a quadrant removed from the vault to show the above. The fissure, beginning in the left parietal bone, meets the lambdoidal suture, and then continues into the articulation between the occipital and temporal bones on its way to the base. The body of the sphenoid bas been fissured right across, and the sutures at the base of the skull generally are loosened. G. C. 3392. 3. 8. Fracture of the Base of the Skull.—Skull of an oldInjuries of Bone. 42 person, in which a fissure beginning on each side near the vertex extends downwards into the base, where the two meet. The fissure on the right side after splitting the parietal bone has loosened the squamous portion of the temporal bone from its articulations, and then has passed across the great wing and body of the sphenoid. The joint between the zygoma and the malar bone has been forced open. The main fissure on the left side, after running through the front of the parietal bone, has opened up the suture between the great wing of the sphenoid and squamous part of the temporal bone before passing to the base. A second fissure on this side extends through the squamous portion of the temporal bone, and after passing through the root of the zygoma meets the first one in the glasserian fissure. The left condyle of the occipital bone has been broken off. G- C- 3393- 3. 9. Fracture of the Base of the Skull.—Skull of a very old person—macerated—A quadrant has been removed from the vault to show the above. The fracture begins at the squamous suture on the right side as a fissure which passes through the roof of the tympanum, crosses irregularly the body of the sphenoid, and ends in the left foramen lacerum medium. The left mastoid process has been broken off. The left zygomatic arch has been broken. The upper jaw is edentulous, and the walls of the antrum are as thin as paper, and in some places wanting. It should be noted that the roof of the naso-pharynx has been involved in this and the last two specimens. G. C. 3312. 3.10. Longitudinal Fissure of the Right Parietal and Frontal Bones.—Calvarium of an old man—in which the sutures on the outer side are for the most part obliterated— showing the above fissure. The patient, having fallen about ten feet, had landed on his head on the stone causeway at Granton Breakwater. He lived in a comatose43 Fractures of the Skull. condition for about twelve hours after his admission into the Royal Infirmary. At the post-mortem examination, the fissure was found to have extended through the anterior fossa of the skull into the hard palate. The fissure begins about two inches from the lambdoidal suture near the middle on the right side, and runs forward, keeping nearly parallel to the middle line. G. C. 3113. Presented by P. H. Maclarek, F.R.C.S.E. 3.11. Fracture of the Base of the Skull.—Portion of the left half of the base of a skull—macerated—showing a fissure running from the vault into the base. The patient had fallen down a stair, and struck the right occiput as well as the left parietal bone. A slight scalp wound, not down to the bone, was all that was seen at the occiput. He was treated as an out- patient at first, but upon his becoming dull, sluggish, and comatose, and showing some blood in his left ear, he was taken into the wards, where he died four days afterwards. The fissure began on the parietal bone, and is seen extend- ing downwards into the squamous portion of the temporal bone. One part passes forwards and another continues into the foramen spinosum. This latter is more visible on the inner than on the outer aspect. There was also some injury to the roof of the tympanum, and the membrana tympani was ruptured, but there is no part of the fissure traceable into the petrous part of the temporal bone. It is of great interest to note that the membrana tympani was ruptured, and that there was bleeding from the ear, although there is no fissure to be detected in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, eyeu after maceration.

There has been injury of the parietal lobe under the rupture in the dura mater, but there is still more extensive laceration at the base. The under surfaces of the left temporo- sphenoidal and of both frontal lobes have been severely lacerated. Possibly the injury to the frontal lobes may have been associated with injury of the right occipital region, but the injury to the left temporo-sphenoidal lobe is not what would have been expected from an injury to the parietal bone on the same side. See No. 3.5. G. C. 2846. Presented by P. H. Maclaren, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 14. Fracture of the Base of the Skull.—Posterior part of the base of a skull—macerated—showing a longitudinal fracture at the base. The left petrous portion of the temporal bone has been broken off, and there are extensive fissures in the posterior fossa, especially on the left side. On the right side a fissure running along the upper surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone has entered the roof of the tympanum. P. P. C. 29. 3. 15.

Post-mortem punctured Fractures of the Skull.— Macerated calvarium, which has been struck from the outside with the small end of a hammer after death. On the outer aspect of the left parietal bone there are two small apertures with indented edges. On the inner aspect the edges of these apertures are splintered off all round, and from the posterior one fissures radiate in various directions. B. C. 1. 2. M. 8. 3.17. Depressed Fracture of the Frontal Bone.—Frontal bone—macerated—showing a depression above the right frontal eminence. Where the bone has been struck, it has been comminuted and driven in, and there is extensive splintering of the inner table. A fissure passes backwards from the injured spot to the coronal suture. The more extensive involvment of the inner table, in such cases, is due to the direction of the injury, i.e. from without inwards, as illustrated in the previous specimen. F. P. C. 28. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 3.18. Depressed Fracture of the Left Parietal Bone.— Triangular portion of the left parietal bone of a soldier, showing an oval depression on the outside with extensive splintering of the inner table. " Lance-Corporal P was admitted to Hospital on 31st July 1892, suffering from a wound of the scalp, three inches long, exposing tho bone,Injuries of Bone. 46 with a distinct depression in the centre of the wound. The injury was caused by a quoit, thrown from a distance of about 20 yards before it struck the skull. There was a rise of temperature and threatening of erysipelas on the fourth day after admission, but absolutely no other symptoms. On August 15th the wound had healed, except for about an eighth of an inch. On the evening of the 16th he made up his own bed and said good-night to the men in the ward. At about 8 a.m. the next morning he was found to be insensible, with stertorous breathing, and died in about an hour. At the post-mortem examination, recent lymph was found all over the surface of the left hemisphere, and about two drachms of pus below the fracture of the inner table. The dura mater was intact, and the brain substance beneath the fracture was not affected. The fissure from the depression to the edge of the bone was caused when removing the skull-cap. The curious part of the case is the absence of all symptoms. There were no eye or pulse symptoms and no pain. The treatment was local, with rest in bed and low diet." This resembles what has been called " pond " fracture, with, in addition, the dint produced by the quoit. The more extensive splintering of the inner table is characteristic. G. C. 3435.

A limited fissure below and in front of the seat of fracture indicates that the bone had been forced in by the injury. The calvarium is interesting anatomically in its having a permanent frontal suture and in its presenting several wormian bones at the lambdoidal suture. B. C. 1. 2. M. 7. 3. 21. Compound depressed Fracture of Skull—Inter- eranial Suppuration—Death.—Skull-cap of a boy, show- ing a localised fracture at the junction of the sagittal and coronal sutures. " The boy from whom this skull-cap was taken received a kick from a horse. Four fissures radiated from the point where the sagittal suture joins the coronal, and there was slight depression in one part. In eight days he had no bad symptoms. The wound was dressed with a dossil of oiled linb. After that time he began to have sickness, and vomiting, and severe headache. For four more days his breathing was stertorous, the left side of his body was paralysed, and he had convulsive twitchings of the right side. Pus oozed through the fissures in the skull; the operation of trepanning was performed. The external layer of bone separated before the internal layer was sawed through ; a quantity of pus was washed away from the dura mater. The symptoms were not improved, and the boy died next clay. "Dissection.—There was extensive ulceration of the dura mater over the longitudinal sinus, and on each side of it; around the ulcer there were blotches of red inflamed parts. The dura mater was greatly thick- ened, and the ulcer had a shreddy surface, which was covered with pus of a bright yellow colour. The veins which entered into the longitudinal sinus were filled with dark coagulated blood, which could not be drawn out from the vessels. Anterior to the ulcer the longitudinal siuus was choked with a firm and light-coloured coagulum ; posteriorly a quantity of pus was squeezed out from the sinus. Under the ulcer of the dura mater, there was also ulceration of the surface of the brain in both the hemi- spheres. The pia mater was turgid with blood. There was inflamma- tion of the substance of the brain in the neighbourhood of the ulcer, but the rest of the brain appeared healthy. There was no fluid in the ventricles." The fissures on the surface indicate that the bone was driven in at the moment of impact. The case has been one of compound depressed fracture, followed by death from sepsis. B. C. 1. 2.

Trephining- for Fracture and Meningeal Haemor- rhage.—Portions cut out by the trephine from the skull of a boy 14 years old, by Mr Wilson. "He had been thrown from a horse about two hours before I saw him. He was taken home insensible, and remained so until the operation. Finding the bone fractured, and a very copious haemorrhage flowing from the fractured part, I immediately applied the trephine, and having thus made an opening and scooped out the coagulated blood, I found that the bleeding came from the principal artery of the dura mater, nearer the basis of the skull than could be got at without destroying life. I was obliged to apply the crown of the trephine seven times before I could remove all that pressed upon the brain. An hour after the operation the boy rallied and recovered without experiencing a single bad symptom in the cure. The operation was performed in 1792. In 1807 I saw him quite well, but the whole of the bone had not regenerated." The under surface of the pieces removed by the trephine show impressions of the middle meningeal artery. As several of the circles are broken, the fracture must have traversed this region. B. C. 1. 2. M. 13. 3. 24.

Compound depressed Fracture of the Skull- Portions of the frontal bone removed in a case of fracture.Fractures of the Skull. 49 " On the evening of the 17th inst. (February 1828) William Murray was admitted with a compound fracture of the skull, attended with very considerable depression of the bone. The patient was quite irrational, ■and very violent when any attempt was made to examine the wound in the forehead. This was enlarged in the course of the fracture, and a small portion of the bone which was completely detached from the con- tiguous parts was then removed. This gave room for the introduction of the levator, by which the remainder of the depressed portions lying transversely across the forehead were first elevated, and subsequently removed with a pair of tooth forceps, leaving an oblong aperture of about two inches in length by three-fourths of an inch in its greatest breadth. A small portion of the brain also made its escape through the wound, although the breach in the dura mater was not perceived at the time of the operation. "This patient instantly recovered his senses, and answered questions rationally ; he soon, however, lapsed into a state bordering on coma, was ■extremely averse to being disturbed, his pulse 126 and thready, his •extremities cold, and his respiration tranquil until the morning of the 18th, when it suddenly became stertorous. You saw him at the usual hour of visit evidently moribund, and he sank immediately afterwards, having survived the receipt of the injury not quite forty-eight hours. '' On the same evening you saw the head opened in the theatre. The fracture was found extending backwards from the two extreme points of the opening through both orbitar plates of the frontal bone, and passing transversely across the ethmoid behind the crista galli. Opposite to the fissures in the roof of either orbit the dura mater was found lacerated to a considerable extent, and portions of the brain protruding; its anterior lobes were found completely disorganised and broken down, and, what was remarkable, a distinct appearance of purulent matter was seen upon the tunica arachnoides covering each hemisphere of the brain, although the patient had survived the accident for so short a time, had lost a very considerable quantity of blood from the wound, and had manifested no inflammatory symptoms."

There has been a depressed fracture at the lower and anterior part of the left parietal bone, and the trephine has been applied, evidently to permit elevation of the fragments. Longitudinal fissures more extensive on the inside pass back- wards and forwards from the seat of injury. The coronal suture has been forced apart for about two inches on either side of the middle line, and beyond that point on the right side, the line of separation has been continued as a fracture passing through the right parietal bone.

" This boy was brought into the hospital in a state of death-like insensibility, and his head misshapen. An effusion upon the temple- tempted me to make an incision through the scalp, and there I found the bone shattered. I applied a small trephine, and afterwards the cranium saw, and took away the pieces of broken bone, and washed out the coagulum from under, but there, followed no amelioration of symptoms. The boy died, and now it is seen that a fracture extended round the fore- head to the base of the skull, and that the injury was too great to allow of the expectation that the patient could live." From the depression behind the seat of fracture, and from the horizontal fissure in the frontal bone, the injury must have been very severe. B. C. 1. 2. M. 2. 3. 32.

Comminution of the Skull resulting- from a Fall. —Calvariurn of a man—macerated—showing a very great comminution of the right side and fissures on the left. The patient was leaning out of a window in a court in the High Street. He lost his balance, and, after falling about thirty feet, landed on his head on the stone pavement below. He was brought at once to- the Infirmary, but when admitted seemed to be dying. His head was flattened on the right side, and his right eye protruded from the orbit. There was no bleeding from ears, nose, or pharynx. A prominence in the back of the pharynx was taken to be a dislocation of the cervical vertebra, and an unsuccessful attempt was made to reduce it. His pulse was slow and weak, and his breathing shallow and irregular. He died in about half an hour after the accident. The amount of comminution is indicated by the number of wires necessary to hold the fragments together, after the soft parts were removed. The following specimen is the other part of this skull. G.

This specimen is important as showing that extensive comminu- tion of the vault and of the base, extending also into the bones of the face, may result from a fall upon the head.

On 27th July 1815 the patient was admitted to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, with the history of having fallen a height of 30 feet on to his head. He had a scalp wound over the seat of fracture, and another above the left eye-brow. There was no bleeding from the nose or ears, and the patient was quite sensible. Pulse 66. He had slight vomiting at times, and his face had an anxious look. In the evening, as his pulse was 74, and as he complained of headache and restlessness, he was bled to 16 ounces, with little benefit. Next day four leeches were applied to each temple. On the third day the patient seemed wonderfully well, but some inflammation had begun round the temple wound. On the seventh day this wound was suppurating, and the bone below was bare. Five leeches were applied to each temple. The wound was poulticed, and antimony and saline mixture were given internally. From this time in spite of repeated leeching and bleeding, he grew gradually worse with headache, rapid pulse, and at first restlessness. Afterwards he became drowsy, and before death comatose. Rigors and vomiting .occurred on the seventeenth and eighteenth days. On the nineteenth day he was trepanned, and the diploe was found to be purulent. On the twentieth day after the accident he died. And on August 16th, at the post-mortem ■examination, about four ounces of blood was found lying over the left orbit The dura mater below the seat of operation was sloughy externally, and internally was covered by purulent matter for some distance round The fracture on the frontal bone was traced down to the base of the skull.55 Fractures of the Skull. Evidently this was _ a case of pyaemia and septicaemia following a compound fracture of the skull. On the outside the bone is slightly roughened by inflamma- tion below and behind the trephine opening, and internally new bone has been thrown out in the main groove for the middle meningeal artery. G. Q. 1010. 3.39. Compound Fracture of the Skull—Consecutive Abscess—Death.—Calvarium of a boy—macerated— showing a hole in the right half of the frontal bone. Two portions of the bone which were removed from the hole immediately after the accident are wired in position near it. "The boy was kicked by a horse, and for four weeks was treated in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. At the end of that time he left, apparently quite well, and with the wound healed. About five weeks after his dis- missal he was twice seized with fits, and was re-admitted into the Hospital. The wound was now tumid and painful. A small speck of bone was removed from it. He lay in bed, listless and without complaining until he became suddenly blind ; he remained sensible, and could recognise his dresser's voice ; by his mother's account, his appetite was good. He died in strong convulsions. " Dissection.— The scalp and dura mater adhered firmly together at the place of the cicatrix; the edges of the bone and dura mater were separate. A very extensive abscess was found to occupy almost the whole of the right hemisphere of the brain. The thinnest parts of the walls of this abscess were opposite to the wound and at the base of the brain near the optic nerves. It was calculated that about eight ounces of pus were evacuated from the abscess. There was no dead bone found on dissection." The margins of the hole in the bone are rounded by the vital processes following the injury, whereas the margins of the loose fragments, removed at the time of the accident, are sharp. There are marks of increased vascularity all over the calvarium, especially on the inner side. B. C. 1. 2. M. 14 c. ».

He was attacked with symptoms which were attributed for a time to the formation of matter under the skull, hut which might he more correctly attributed to typhus fever, since after death no signs of affection of the brain could be discovered'* (Sir Charles Bell). The surface of the greater part of the frontal bone is roughened by the opening out of vascular pores, and the smooth dead portion of bone is surrounded by a groove formed by granulation tissue. There are two slight fissures in the frontal bone, one near the necrosed piece, and another at a corresponding place on the other side, but these may have been made in removing the calvarium. B.

Bullet Wound of the Skull, from the Battlefield Of Culloden.— Calvarium of an adult — macerated — which has been perforated by a musket ball from front to back. "The skull was found on tliat part of the field of Culloden where the Highlanders, wrapping their plaids about their left arms, and stooping low, made their attack on the King's troops." In the upper part of the frontal bone, to the left of the middle line, there is an oval aperture measuring \\ inch by 1 inch. Its margin is regular on the outer surface, but on theGunshot fractures of the Skull. 59 cranial surface the bone is chipped off irregularly round. At the back, in the right side of the occipital bone, between the superior curved line and the lambdoidal suture, there is a larger and more irregular aperture measuring by 1^ inch. In this case the greater irregularity and chipping off is seen on the outer surface, while the cranial margin is smooth, a condition the reverse of what is present at the anterior aperture. As it is known that with the musket ball, at least, the entrance wound in the skull was smaller than the exit wound, and that the bevelling is with any bullet always on the margins of the apertures towards which the bullet is travelling, the condition of the apertures in this skull entirely corroborate the historical account of the action on that part of the battle- field on which it was found.

The man, who was a servant, had shot himself. He lived for forty- eight hours afterwards. The bullet split in two. One part was found beneath the scalp, three inches from the wound, and the other part passed inwards, and was found beside the falciform process of the dura mater. The hole is larger in its vertical than in its transverse measurement, probably from the upward direction of the shot, and the chipping is greater upon the cranial than upon the outer margin of the aperture. It may be noted that the bevelling is greater on the inner and upper surfaces, than upon the posterior and lower surfaces, probably indicating the direction of the bullet. At the upper part of the outer margin some lead has been impacted. This probably points to where the ball was 8Plifc- B. C. xvu. 2. . 50.

An incision was made ever the left temple. After raising the bone, the ball was found flattened and was extracted. The patient survived for four days after this. There is an aperture, 3J inches hy ± inch, at the anterior inferior angle of the right parietal hone. The chipping off within shows that the hall had entered there. On the left side, above the outer end of the left supraciliary ridge, the hone is extensively broken and splintered, and more so externally than internally, indicating that the shot had struck that part from within.

Fracture of the Cranium by a Musket Shot.—62 Injuries of Bone. Skull of a young adult—macerated—to show a bullet wound and trephine opening in the left frontal region. 1' The hall struck this soldier on the sphenoidal angle of the frontal bone. It fractured the bone into small pieces. These were picked away, and a question arose whether or not the ball had entered. The dura mater was entire. It had not, then, entered the cavity, and an examina- tion being made with the probe under the skull, the ball was discovered lodged above the left eye. Calculation being made of its exact distance from the place of the fracture, the trephine was applied there, and the ball extracted. The portion of the bone cut out by the trephine is attached to the skull, and the ball is replaced. The ball is flattened in that manner to give the idea of its only being half a ball. The man died of suppuration in the brain." The piece of bone and the ball alluded to in Sir Charles Bell's account of the case have been mislaid or lost. The upper left canine tooth is retained within the alveolus in this skull. B. C. xvn. 1. 3. 57.

The ball penetrated just above the right supraciliary ridge, and destroyed part of the roof of the orbit, where it seems to have been lodged. For two weeks the man suffered from paroxysms of intense pain. The bullet was then spontan- eously discharged, along with much pus, and he soon recovered. For the next seven years until his death he acted as a shepherd, and was very intelligent for a native. During three years he suffered from a dull headache more or less constant. He was killed in a quarrel with another native." The skull is very heavy and thick, and the bony ridges are strongly marked. C. 2531. Presented by Forbes, Esq. 3. 58.

From first to last there was no evidence of affection of either motion or sensation. (See Medico- Chirwrgical Transactions, London, vol. xx. p. 78.) The remarkable escape of the spinal cord, is explained by the fact that the posterior part of the arch of the atlas remained in position while the rest of the bone was dislocated forwards, carrying with it the odontoid process, which was at the same time snapped off. This accident seems to be unique. G. C. 2782. 3. 66.

The spinous processes of the fourth and fifth cervical vertebra are broken off at their roots, the bodies of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae have been dislocated, and the upper part of the sixth vertebra has been fractured. The fifth transverse process has been broken on the right side, and the sixth and seventh on the left side. "It is clearly proved both by the symptoms and the dissection of the bones, that the fracture must have affected the roots of the phrenic nerves; and we are at liberty to conclude that the difference of symptoms, in comparing it with the first case (3. 71) as well as the shorter period of his sufferings, was due to this cause."

His convulsions returned, and he was relieved by bleeding. In a few hours his jaw began to move with great rapidity, and continued moving in an extraordinary manner for nearly five minutes, when all at once he exclaimed that he could speak. He was maniacal. He proved he was not at all paralytic, for it required two men to hold him., and he almost sprung out of bed to be revenged on the nurse. He passed a great deal of feces and flatus with singular force. In twelve hours he became again rational. On the third day after the attack of convulsions he complained of difficulty in using his arm, and two days after he had total palsy of the lower extremities, which was more remarkable as at this time he regained the use of his arm. He lived for a week after this, but continued sinking, and still retained about him much of the character of typhus fever. The day before his death he was perfectly sensible, and had recovered sensation in his legs, for he could feel the rubbing of a finger upon them. At this time, although he appeared to pass his faeces involuntarily, still he passed them with great force, and he was able to eject an enema which was given contrary to his desire. Dissection.—The brain was examined carefully, and nothing was remarked except a little effusion between the pia mater and tunica arachnoides. On cutting the muscles by the side of the last cervical vertebra, a little pus oozed out. It was found to come from between the vertebra?. On dissecting up the muscles, there was found to be an evident loosening of the last cervical from the first dorsal vertebras. The inter- ventral substance was completely destroyed, and an immense quantity of pus surrounded them. On the back part the pus had extended under the scapula, and on the fore part was bounded by the oesophagus. On examining the spinal canal, the pus was found to have dropped down the whole length of the sheath to the cauda-equina." (See Bell's "Surgical Observations," 1816, p. 145.)

The crushing of the fifth body has probably been caused by the forcible forward bending of the spine, while the injury to the spinous processes and ribs may have been the result of direct violence.

"Thomas Wills, eet. 30, while trying to extinguish a fire, fell from the roof of a house for a distance of two stories, and landed with his back upon the pavement. (He seems to have been doubled forwards, and perhaps turned a somersault as he struck the ground.) " No injury to the spine was to be felt, but he had lost sensation of and motion in all the lower part of his body and lower extremities. The bladder and intestines were insensible to their natural stimuli; ho complained of a pain in his back, and referred it to the middle dorsal vertebra?. "Respiration was performed by a heaving of his chest, the abdomen being full and flaccid. There was a catch in his breath from pain running round his ribs on a line with the injury of the spine. "For six days he remained in this state, the catheter being used twice daily.Injuries of Bone. 72 " At the end of this time his breathing became more affected. Ob the twelfth day after the injury his breathing became more rapid—60 per minute. It afterwards became slower, and he died. He was frequently bled and cupped, but without relief. " At the post-mortem examination much coagulated blood lay over the sixth and seventh dorsal vertebra;, and the spinous processes of these vertebra; were broken. The tube of the spine was forced in upon the spinal marrow, and a sharp portion of bone belonging to the body of the vertebra had pierced and lay pressing on the spinal marrow. A rib was fractured on the left side, the broken extremity of which pressed against the pleura. This side of the chest showed marks of inflammation." The body of the sixth dorsal vertebra is severely crushed and comminuted, as in the previous specimen, and the upper part of the seventh body has been broken off on the right side. The heads of the fifth and sixth ribs have been broken off on the left side. The lamina? and spine of the sixth vertebra has been fractured horizontally, and the left lamina of the seventh vertebra vertically. One of the pieces of the body of the sixth vertebra was driven back upon the spinal cord. B. C. 1. 4. M. 8. 3. 79. Healed Fracture of the Dorsal Spine, after Severe Crushing.—Dorsal vertebrae, from the sixth to the eleventh in- clusive, with the corresponding ribs—macerated and dried. The laminae are removed to expose the spinal canal from the back. The spinal cord was torn across, and the patient survived the injury nearly two months. The condition seen is the result of extensive crushing and comminution of the bodies of the seventh, eighth, and ninth vertebrae, with subsequent healing. The spinal canal is entirely obliterated by crushing back of the bodies upon it. The crushing has been so complete that, except for the presence of the ribs, it would have been almost impossible to have said how many vertebrae were involved. On the left side, the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs are packed as closely as they will go. It may be noted that, as is com-Fractures of the Spine. 73 monly the case, the upper part of the spinal column is displaced in front of the lower. G. C. 1473.

Fracture of the Spine in the Mid-Dorsal Region.— Fifth to ninth dorsal vertebrae—macerated and dried—showing the above injury. The seventh vertebra has suffered most of all. Its body is comminuted, its transverse processes broken off, and its laminse fractured near the pedicles. The front of the eighth body has been broken off; also the following transverse processes, the right of the fifth vertebra, both of the sixth, and the left of the eighth and ninth. The fracture has evidently been pro- duced by bending forward the spine, with the usual tendency to forward displacement of the upper fractured portion of the column. G. C. 3309. 81.

He had complete loss of motion and sensation in his lower limbs. He could not make water, but the bladder emptied itself after a catheter had been inserted. A plaster jacket was applied. On the third day he had septic cystitis, very foetid urine, and considerable pain across the abdomen. On the ninth day he died of collapse, with vomiting, belcbing, and abdominal symptoms. At the post-mortem examination the bladder was found to have sloughed into the peritoneum, and his death had been due to septic peritonitis.

Fracture through the tenth Dorsal Vertebra in an Old Man.—Portion of the ninth and the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae—the muscles cleaned off, dried and partly varnished, to show the above condition. The spine had previously been anchylosed, and therefore would not bend. The fracture has passed irregularly through the body, lamina, and spinous processes. The bony masses which had produced the previous anchylosis are seen on either side of the front of the bodies (Arthritis deformans).

The muscles are dissected off—in spirit. The body of the tenth vertebra has been displaced for- wards and downwards, and has crushed a fragment from the upper and back part of the eleventh vertebra back upon the spinal cord, so as to bruise and compress it. An irregular fracture is seen running through the body of the eleventh vertebra. This specimen was used by Sir Charles Bell as an argument for the uselessness of trephining the spine after injury.

Forward Dislocation and Fracture of the Body of the eleventh, and Fracture of that of the twelfth Dorsal VertebraB.—Eleventh and twelfth dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae-—cleaned, dried, and varnished, to show the above condition. The patient, John Cameron, was admitted to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on 12th October 1807, with loss of motion and sensation below the thorax, as the result of an injury. About a week before death it was noted that his water continued to be mixed with purulent matter, and also that the catheter was introduced with difficulty, apparently from its point getting into a false passage. There was a very extensive slough over the os sacrum, as well as over the injured part of the spine, the latter being on the increase. At this time the patient was incoherent, and took little food. On the morning of 2nd November he was attacked with spontaneous vomiting of a greenish-coloured matter, and on the following day his pulse could hardly be felt at the wrist, while the vomiting had been continuous. On 4th November—i.e., twenty-three days after the accident—he died. The spinal canal must have been completely obliterated and the lower end of the cord crushed. G. C. 173 b.

A. M., set. 31, a fireman, on 26th February 1891 fell through a hatchway into the forepeak, a distance of ten feet, and must have landed across an iron wheel, but cannot say how he struck it, as he was rendered unconscious. He was pulled up by the sailors, by means of a rope under his arm-pits, carried to his berth, and next day taken to Hamburg Hospital. There he lay for two months till he was brought to Leith, and admitted to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on 29th April 1891. On admission he was very white, weak, and prostrate. He had no feeling below the iliac crests, and neither movement nor sensation in the lower limbs. There was tactile sensation in the lumbar region, but it was delayed. Some hyperesthesia existed above the twelfth rib. There was a depression below the twelfth dorsal spine. There were bedsores on the sacrum, the calves, and at the malleoli of both legs. Sphincters were relaxed, and fteces and the urine came away involuntarily. The urineInjuries of Bone. 76 was turbid and ammoniacal. The patient's bladder was washed out, and his bedsores attended to. In spito of all treatment, he got gradually weaker, and died, partly of exhaustion, and partly of septic absorption, about two months after his admission. The portion suspended above shows well the compression and crushing of the anterior part of the body of the twelfth, with the forward displacement of the eleventh dorsal vertebra, so as to diminish the spinal canal by drawing the laminae of the eleventh towards the upper part of the body of the twelfth. The portion of the specimen suspended below shows the effect of this displacement upon the lower end of the cord, and the nerves accompanying it. G-. C. 3316. Presented by A. G.

The right halves of the bodies have been removed, so as to dis- play the canal from the front. The patient lived for about six weeks after the accident. The crushing backwards of the last dorsal body has been so great that at their anterior margins, the lower border of the eleventh dorsal and the upper border of the first lumbar verte- bra? almost touch, and the body of the twelfth dorsal vertebra has been crushed back upon the canal, so as to com- pletely obliterate it.

His bladder was paralysed, and in two days hematuria began and continued. In spite of every care in cleansing the catheter used to draw off his water, septic cystitis appeared in a few days, and carried him off about a week after the accident. At the post-mortem examination the mucous membrane of the bladder was found greatly congested, and at places sloughing. The con- gestion extended up both ureters. The left kidney was bruised. The end of the spinal cord and beginning of the cauda equina have been crushed between the laminae of the twelfth dorsal and the body of the first lumbar vertebrae. The anterior part of the first lumbar vertebra has been so much crushed that the anterior margins of the last dorsal and second lumbar vertebrae nearly meet. G. C. 2799.

Fracture of the Spinal Column at the Level of the second Lumbar Vertebra.—Lower part of the last dorsal and first three lumbar vertebrae—muscles cleaned off—in spirit, showing the above injury. '' A young man, named Auton, 25 years of age, a plasterer, fell from a height of 40 feet, and in his descent his back struck against the corner of a stone stair, about 18 feet from the ground. "When brought to the Hospital, a swelling was to be felt over the lower dorsal vertebra. On pressing the finger deep, a depression or interval betwixt the spinous processes could be distinguished. He complained of great pain in the part, and all over the abdomen. He breathed naturally, and was perfectly sensible; there was no defect of motion or of feeling in the lower extremities. He was bled to sixteen ounces, twelve leeches were applied to his back, and he had a dose of the house physic. He was admitted September 12th, 1816. " 13th.— He has passed a restless night.

His breathing is very quick and laboured; his pulse hurried ; his countenance is sunk, and his tongue is covered with a brown fur About an hour before death a change took place from that happy delirium, and groaning as in much pain, he fell insensible and died. The eleventh dorsal vertebra (sic) was fractured in its body. The spinous process of the same vertebra was crushed. The spinal marrow did not appear to have suffered mechanically, or to have been crushed. Pus, thick in consistence and of a greenish colour, lay betwixt the sheath and the spinal marrow. There was an effusion of serum betwixt the membranes of the brain." It is evident, on carefully examining the specimen, that the injury has been to the second lumbar, and not to the eleventh dorsal vertebra. The description of the injury, more- over, quite tallies with the condition of the specimen, so that this discrepancy cannot be accounted for by any mistake m its identity It is important to note that this injury has been pro- duced in a different way to that of the previous specimens. From the nature of the accident, the spinal column has pro- bably been injured directly where the man struck his back, also indirectly by its having been bent backwards (not forwards, as , \ B C. 1. 4.

The patient, Mary Kidd, set. 55, fell down some stone steps on Saturday night, December 29, 1827. When admitted to the Eoyal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on January 2, 1828, the following report was made :—"The whole of the left upper extremity is ecchymosed and much swollen ; there is a distinct crepitus near the upper end of the humerus, and during the rotation of the bone the head remains motionless, the lower end of the bone is drawn in towards the chest, pulse 100 and feeble, belly costive, tongue furred, the pain at the upper part of the limb has been constantly upon the increase." On the 4th of January the patient was observed to be labouring under the symptoms of delirium tremens; she had been constantly talking during the preceding night, and did not answer questions ration- ally ; had much tremor of the hands, pulse 90, skin cool, tongue moist. These symptoms continued with considerable variation and with occasional intermissions until about the 18th, when a considerable slough was observed on the sacrum and right buttock. This increased pro- gressively notwithstanding the use of every means to protect the parts from pressure, and she expired on the 28th January. The head of the hone has been separated along nearly the line of the anatomical neck, and the tuberosities and upper part of the shaft have been severely comminuted. This has probably been the result of a blow directly upon the shoulder. G. C. 1100. Presented by Sir George Ballingalt,. 105.

The arm was amputated at the shoulder joint a few hours after the accident by Sir George Ballingall, and the patient recovered without a bad symptom. The fracture has passed between the anatomical and sur- gical necks on the outer side, and through the anatomical neck on the inner side of the bone, i.e. in a line corresponding to that of the epiphysial junction in a young subject. The rari- fication of bone round the seat of fracture makes it appear as if the patient had survived the injury for some weeks, and as if this piece had had a vascular supply. G. C. 744.

The patient, aged 40, after having been treated in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, for fractured humerus was discharged. On August 24, 1825, she was re-admitted for pain and a fluctuating swelling in the region of the fracture. Next day the swelling was incised, and a great .quantity of thin, glairy fluid was discharged. On the 10th of September, symptoms of septictemia appeared, the wound inflamed and suppurated, and on the 16th September she died suddenly, apparently much exhausted. The adjacent surfaces of hone are smooth, hut the provisional callous on the inner and front part seems to have united round the hone hefore death. The surface of the bone ahove and below the fracture is roughened and covered by new periosteal outgrowth in a way common in septic irritation. This seems to have been a case of ununited fracture with serous exudation round the broken ends, and septicaemia following the incision. The small part of callous union pro- bably occurred after the second admission to the Infirmary. G. C. 1011. 2. 125.

The bones have been united at a considerable angle, and there is callous thickening round the seat of fracture, especially on the radius. The epiphyseal lines are apparent at the lower end of both bones on the dorsal aspect. This has probably been a fracture of the radius and a green- stick fracture of the ulna. F- P. C. 74.

The ulna, fractured a little below the middle, is united in bad position. The lower fragment is displaced inwards from the tipper, and is somewhat rotated inwards on its own axis. The head and styloid processes are greatly altered, apparently by arthritis deformans. The radius has an ununited fracture about the middle. The broken ends are enlarged and irregular, and their contiguous surfaces are rough. At the lower end the radius has been broken about half an inch above the articular surface, and the lower fragment has been displaced outwards and backwards, but without much rotation backwards. The styloid process has, however, thus been raised above the level of that of the ulna.. This iniurv might be called a form of Colles' fracture. J G. C. 3449.

United fracture of the Radius between the attach- ments of the Pronator Radii Teres and Supinator Brevis.—Plaster of Paris cast of a right radius showing the above. The fracture has united in a bad position in two ways. Besides a distinct angular deformity there has been a relative rotation of the two fragments ; the upper is in supination, and the lower in pronation. This latter deformity can only be prevented by treating the fractured limb in the supine position. G. C. 3089. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 130.

United Fracture of the Radius near its Lower End.—Skeleton of a left forearm—cleaned and dried, showing the above. The radius at the seat of fracture, i.e. about two inches92 Injuries of Bone. above the lower end, is brought near the ulna. The articular surface for the carpus looks slightly backwards, and the styloid process has been displaced upwards. These alterations resemble those found in Colles' fracture, which, however, is usually at a lower level. The ulna at its lower end is bent away from the radius, and its styloid process projects unduly. G. C. 2785. Presented by Johnson Symington, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 132a.

The radius has been fractured about half an inch above its lower end; the carpal articular surface has been forced back- wards and upwards, and looks obliquely backwards. Its styloid process is now on a level with that of the ulna. The carpus and lower fragment of the radius thus project93 Fractures of the Radius and Ulna. backwards and towards the radial side; the lower end of the upper fragment projects forwards. Owing to this and to the backward rotation of the lower fragment of the radius the usual hollow on the front of the lower end of the bone has disappeared. The styloid process of the ulna relatively projects. The head is altered. The olecranon process has been broken and is partially united. G. C. 2786. Presented by Johnson Symington, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 135. United Colles' Fracture.—Skeleton of the left hand and forearm of an old woman—cleaned and dried, showing the above. The patient was an old woman, the most of whose bones were in a condition of senile osteo-malacia. The lower end of the radius has been rotated backwards, and has been forced to the radial side. The styloid process of the radius is on the level of that of the ulna. There were no adhesions either in the joints or in the synovial sheaths of the wrist. The flexor carpi ulnaris tendon is in its usual place. G. C. 3220. Presented by Charles "VV. Cathcart, Esq., F.R.C.S.E. 3. 136.

In consequence the radius was broken. The fracture was at first enclosed in splints, without being reduced, and the patient was sent by the surgeon of the works to a surgeon in Edinburgh. The latter, on the supposition that the fracture had been set, left it in the splints, and lastly, the patient, by some mistake, did not return for six weeks to have the splints removed. In consequence the hand became practically useless. Refracture was found impossible, and massage did no good. It will be observed that there is little or no lateral displacement. This confirms the view that the usual presence of lateral displacement is due to the direction of the breaking strain- G. C. 3100. Presented by Charles "W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 141.

United "Smith's" Fracture.—Eight radius and ulna, carpus, and part of metacarpus—macerated, showing the above.' There has been a fracture through the lower end of the radius, just above the articular surface, with a displacement similar to that seen in Colles' fracture, only forwards instead of backwards. The styloid process of the radius is at a higher level than that of the ulna. The articular surface of the radius looks now very obliquely forwards. The normal hollow, just above the articular surface in front, is increased, while there is a marked projection at a corresponding place at the back. There are deep grooves on the back of the radius for the tendons of the extensor secundi internodil pollicis and the extensor indicis. This fracture is produced by a forcible bending of the hand forwards, i.e. in a direction the reverse of that in which Colles' fracture is produced. q. q 355j Presented by Charles W.

United Intra-eapsular Fracture of the Neck.— Posterior half of the upper end of a right femur, muscles dissected off—in spirit, showing the above. "An enfeebled lady, aged 77 (November 1821), in attempting to walk from her bedroom to an adjoining apartment, slipped her foot suddenly and unexpectedly over the ledge of a landing of a flight of stairs, and immediately fell on the right hip. She attempted to rise, but found that she had completely lost the power of motion in the limb of that side. Her servants, on ooming to her assistance, found her sitting on the landing-place, her feet resting on the step below. She was immediately conveyed to bed, but being in comparatively little pain, and it being late in the evening, no medical assistance was required till next morning. I found her in the position in which she had remained during the night, resting upon her back, the right limb a little bent and apparently shortened about an inch and a half, the knee and toes con- siderably everted, the heel resting in the hollow between the ankle and the tendo-achilles of the left leg. She made no complaint, but of inability to move the leg, but all attempts to rotate the thigh occasioned consider- able pain in the situation of the trochanter major, as did also the extension of the limb to bring the malleoli-interni together, which was readily accomplished, but retraction immediately took place, and the leg returned to its original position. No crepitus could be distinguished. Judging from the history and appearances of the case, fracture of the neck of the femur had taken place, and her friends were apprised of the helpless state to which, in all probability, she would be reduced, from no complete re-union being expected. The treatment was therefore very simple. The upper part of the thigh was frequently fomented ; a broad firm bandage was constantly worn from the knee along the thigh and encircling the body. The limb was supported with pillows, and every attempt made to keep it extended, and the heel in apposition. Under this plan, she remained about five months, occasionally changing from her bed to a sofa. She then began to make some partial use of the leg, and, with the assistance of crutches and gently resting on the toes, she was enabled to move through the room. She ultimately laid aside the crutches, and walked with the assistance of a stout stick. She also, by and by, relinquished the use of the stick, and with the aid of a very high-heeled shoe she was enabled in the course of a year to walk with great facility through her house, and for more than a twelvemonth before her last illness to descend and ascend daily from one flat of her house to another to and from dinner, the knee and foot continuing considerably turned out, and the leg shortened upwards of an inch. In November 1823 she was seized with an affection of the brain, which proved fatal in April 1824." This would seem to have been an impacted intra-capsular fracture of the neck of the femur, for the following reasons, 1. The injury was apparently calculated to produce. viz.Injuries of Bone. 106 impaction. 2. Crepitus, although looked for, was absent immediately after the accident, although against this it is right to set the shortening, which could apparently he overcome. 3. The great shortening of the neck and its impaction into the head are distinctly seen, especially above, while there is no appearance of impaction of the neck into the great trochanter. As is usual in impaction near the head, the outer fragment has been driven into the inner one. The capsule seems thickened. The lower fragment has been everted, and the trochanter is almost on a level with the head. The bone is condensed in the head and at the line of fracture. G. C. 746.

The case was considered by some surgeons to be one of unreduced dislocation of the femur. Sir Charles Bell in consultation confirmed the diagnosis of fracture of the neck of the femur, and this was afterwards verified by post-mortem examination. The patient lived for two years after the accident. The capsule of the hip joint has been greatly thickened, and the neck of the bone has been almost entirely absorbed. Fibrous tissue unites the broken surfaces which are flattened. The cartilage covering the head of the bone shows the changes usually found in arthritis deformans.

Somewhat recent Extra-capsular Fracture of the Neck, without splitting- of the Great Trochanter.— Upper end of a right femur—macerated, showing the above. The specimen was taken from a subject in the dissecting-rooms. The patient had probably survived the injury for several weeks. The line of fracture is just within the capsule in front, but is outside of it behind. The lesser trochanter is wanting. New periosteal bony growth is seen on the front of the neck, especially on the lower fragment, and other evidences of periostitis can be traced for several inches down the shaft. Some absorption has taken place in the interior. The fracture has apparently been produced by a fall on the trochanter, with a force sufficient to detach the neck from the rest of the bone, and to break off the lesser trochanter, but not sufficient to split the greater trochanter by crushing it in upon the root of the neck.

From the periosteal new bone thrown out at the upper end of the shaft of the femur, the patient has evidently survived the accident for several weeks. The neck has given way at its junction with the great trochanter, and the latter has been comminuted by the impaction of the neck into it. The locking of the neck into the fragments of the trochanter has been undone, probably in the preparation of the specimen. In the printed Catalogue published in 1836 this specimen was taken to be that numbered in the Bell Catalogue, i. 1.

The bone shows the usual appearances produced by a slight amount of impaction of the neck upon the trochanters. The shortening and eversion must have been very slight.

Four years before death, the patient, an old lady aged 71, fell on the carpet in her room, and immediately afterwards suffered from pain and powerlessness of her right limb. She was seen by Drs John Duncan and R. A. Lundie, who recognised "the usual symptoms of unimpacted extra-capsular fracture of the femur. It had none of the symptoms of HH4 Injuries of Bone. an impacted fracture." After six weeks of treatment by long splint and extension, the bone seemed united, but a starch bandage was applied and kept on for some time afterwards as an extra security. In a year or so she had as good use of her limb as she had had before. The bone shows the usual appearances produced by a slight amount of impaction of the neck upon the trochanters, i.e. some thickening at the front of the neck and some splitting at the back of the great trochanter. The eversion must have been very slight, and there seems to have been no shortening at all, possibly owing to the extension used in the treatment. The anterior half shows that the cancellous tissue has been reformed with even less indication of fracture than in the previous G. C. 2905. specimen. Presented by R. A.

Ununited Extra-eapsular Fracture of the Neck.— Upper end of a left femur—macerated, showing the ahove. The neck of the bone has apparently given way nearer to the head than usual, but there has been the characteristic splitting of the great trochanter by impaction of the neck into it. Much new bone has been thrown out from the upper part of the shaft behind, below, and especially in front. The majority of the smaller fragments have united to one another and to the main piece only by fibrous tissue. The upper fragment, consisting of the head and part of the neck, has no new bone formed upon it, and its broken margin is quite sharp, except where it has been mechanically worn against the upper part of the shaft. Above this worn part the surface of the bone shows some superficial erosions, as if granulation tissue had been absorbing it. The want of formative power in this upper fragment is probably due to insufficient vascular supply, a condition which so often leads to non-union in the intra- capsular variety of fracture.

The patient survived the injury several years. During the patient's life there was difference of opinion among several surgeons as to the exact nature of the injury. The case was originally treated as one of fracture of the neck, but some afterwards held that it was an unreduced dislocation. Sir Charles Bell in consultation confirmed the diagnosis of fracture, and this view was verified at the post-mortem examination. The fracture has the usual characters as to the giving way of the neck and splitting of the trochanters. The fragments are united by firm fibrous tissue, and the leg has been considerably shortened and everted. B. C. r. 1. M. 20. .203.

The bones on the fractured side are placed in the position in which they were found on dissection. The fracture is of the impacted extra-capsular variety.

The appearances presented by this specimen are remarkable and unusual. The lower fragment at its upper end has all the appearance of a healed impacted extra-capsular fracture of the type seen in Nos. 3.199 and 3.200, to the latter of winch it has a considerable resemblance. But there is also an ununited fracture of the neck, as well as changes in the upper fragment such as are produced by arthritis deformans. It is highh probable that arthritis deformans followed the impacted extra-119 Fractures of the Femur. capsular fracture, and that, last of all, the neck was broken close to the head.

The specimen was taken from a subject in the Dissecting Rooms. The head, neck, and great trochanter have been split off from the small trochanter and shaft. The upper fragment has been tilted outwards, but not forwards. This displacement is probably dependent upon the direction of the obliquity of the fracture, which has run from within outwards and downwards, leaving the psoas and iliacus muscles upon the lower fragment. The spaces seen in the interior of the bone were filled by a brown, jelly-like material. Bony union has been complete. G. C. 3255. Presented by Johnson Symington, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 207.

There has been much inflammation, and the surfaces above and below the fracture are crusted with newly-formed periosteal bone. The fracture has therefore probably been compound. F. P. C. 126. 3. 221. Badly united Fracture a little way below the Small Trochanter.—Upper end of a left femur—macerated, and divided vertically, showing the above.

United Fracture a little below the Lesser Tro- chanter.—Left femur—macerated, showing the above. The upper end is tilted outwards and slightly forwards.. The lower part of the shaft has lost its usual forward bendr and has received a slight bend backwards as well as one' distinctly outwards. The outer condyle is thus relatively raised, and some knock-knee must have existed. Although in some respects the shape of this bone resembles that found in rickets, its similarity to the specimens which pre-125 Fractures of the Femur. cede and follow it renders more probable the theory of old- standing fracture. The lower part of the shaft shows signs of a slight perios- titis. B. C. i. 1. M. 32. a. 3. 223. United Fracture a little below the Lesser Tro- chanter.—Left femur of an aged man—macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment has been tilted outwards and slightly forwards, and the level of the head is below that of the great trochanter. There is much thickening round the fracture, extending downwards in the shaft. The broken ends have been hidden in front by the callus, but are still distinct behind. The lower end of the shaft preserves its normal forward bend, but, as in the former case, the inner condyle is prolonged downwards, and there has probably been knock-knee. The whole bone is lightened, probably, however, from advanced age. The articular surfaces show changes indicative of arthritis deformans. B. C. i. 1. M. 32. b. 3. 224. Badly united Fracture a little below the Lesser Trochanter.—Eight femur of an adult—macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment is tilted greatly outwards, and is displaced behind the lower one. The head of the bone is on a level with the great trochanter, and the whole shaft has had an outward bend at the seat of fracture, which is only partially compensated for by a slight bend inwards at the lower end. The inner condyle is prolonged downwards, and there has evidently been knock-knee. The bone, although not thickened, is unusually heavy. From the rounding off of the prominences at the seat of fracture, and from the evidently secondary changes in the lower end of the shaft, the fracture, may be considered one of long standing. B.

The medullary cavity of each fragment has been closed in by bone, and a spur of bone has grown from the side of the upper fragment. Between this and the lower fragment a false joint (adventitious bursa) has formed. This has been laid open and a fibrous band crossing it is indicated by a bristle.

The knee was crushed between a cart-wheel and a wall. The patient was about 60 years of age, and lived six weeks after the accident, when she died from diseased aorta producing hydro-thorax. The condylar portion of the bone has been broken off from the shaft, and an oblique fissure has separated the inner and a small piece of the outer condyle from the rest of the condylar fragment. There has been an extensive formation of new periosteal bone upon the lower end of the shaft, but only a slight amount upon the lower fragments. The appearance of this new periosteal bone indicates septic irritation. It is probable, therefore, that the fracture has been compound. F. P. C. 137. Presented by Professor J. W. Turner and A.

Separation of the Lower Epiphysis of the Femur,134 Injuries of Bone. —Eight femur of a boy aged 13—macerated, showing the above. The lower epiphysis is quite separate from the shaft. The patient fell from the joisting of a house on the floor below, and his right leg went through the flooring. When brought into the Hospital, the house surgeon reported to Mr J. a case of common fracture of the thigh-bone. He lay with the usual securities upon the limb for about a fortnight before I was called to consult upon it. The boy was hectic, much reduced, a dry tongue, irritable pulse, and upon the inside of the knee there were deep sloughy spots. Next day, in consequence of the restlessness of the boy during the night, I found the bone sticking through the integuments, and saw from the appearance of the bone that the case had been mistaken, and that, instead of a fracture communicating with the joint, it was a diastasis, or separation of the epiphysis. Even now I thought it nof too late to amputate, with some chance of the boy's surviving, but it was thought he had somewhat rallied from the day preceding, and that he might be still better on the morrow. On that day he died The dissection exhibited great suppuration within the knee- joint an immense abscess or cavity communicating with the knee-joint, and extending up the bone nearly to the hip. The periosteum could be torn with the fingers from half the length of the bone. Such, then are the consequence of a diastasis of the lower head of the femur, and by this we see that the case classes itself with the worst kinds of fractures communicating with the knee-joint. Apparently a small portion has been broken off the lower end of the shaft. The surface of the shaft at the lower end has at some places a considerable crust of new periosteal bone, while at others the vascular pores are opened out. A similar opening out is seen all the way up the shaft. At the front of the neck a patch of the surface is eroded. These changes have evidently been due to septic osteo-myelitis, an accidental consequent of the injury. B. C. I. 1. M. 8. a. 3. 249.

It was found necessary finally to amputate the limb. (For the remainder of the case, see the series illustrating arterial disease.) The epiphysis has been united to the lower end of the shaft, with its back part projecting downwards, and its inferior parts looking forwards. The lower end of the shaft projects behind the epiphysis, and is rough and irregular. Although the epiphysis and the shaft are in bad position, the union between them has been exceedingly solid.

There has been great periostitic enlargement of both bones. The lower fragment of the tibia near the fracture is greatly eroded, and was probably necrotic, but no fragments are loose. The upper fragment of the tibia is enlarged, and its broken surface is hollowed out and very irregular. The upper frag- ment of the fibula is enlarged and condensed. A mass of new bone unites the lower end of the tibia to that of the fibula, but there has been no union between any of the other fragments. F. P. C. 158. 3 276.

He attempted to walk at first, but being unable to do so was afterwards driven home. Next day the fracture was reduced. In twenty-four hours afterwards great swelling came on, "the skin presenting a dark blush and numerous large dark-coloured phylctense." The splints were removed and leeches were applied. Eight hours after- wards the displacement was renewed by an involuntary muscular movement. The redness extended to the thigh, and over the inner malleolus a elough formed 3 x 2\ inches. On the 21st January an attack of delirium tremens came on and lasted for three days, during which the leg was much tossed about. Eventually the ankle-joint was opened into, and an abscess formed on the outer side. On the 1st of February the limb was amputated below the knee and the patient did well. There is a fracture of the fibula about two inches above the malleolus, also rupture of the internal lateral ligament, and dislocation of the whole foot outwards.

The greater part of the os calcis seems to have been crushed up behind and to the outer side of the astragalus.

The knee had been completely detached by grape-shot at Waterloo. "This poor wretch was not relieved by amputation for fifteen days after the battle." The line of fracture is irregular, and two fissures run upwards for about three inches. At the seat of fracture, the bone is smooth. Eound this there is a shallow groove of separation, while beyond that the surface is rough, partly from a slight crust of new periosteal bone, and partly from the opening up of vascular pores. It is important to note the extent to which these changes have been carried in a fortnight. B. C. xvii. 41. 343. Gunshot Fracture of the Lower End of a Femur. —Lower end of a left femur—macerated, to show the above. One or two fragments have been driven into the interior. The patient was wounded at Waterloo. The marks of periostitis indicate that the patient must have waited many days before amputation was performed.

Severe Gunshot Fracture of the Lower End of the Femur.—The lower end of the shaft of a right femur- macerated. Several pieces are missing, and the remaining fragments are wired together. The wound was received at Waterloo. The condylar portion of the bone has been split in several directions. The joint has been opened into, and, from the erosion of the articular surface, must have been the seat of suppuration. The lower end of the upper fragment shows changes similar to those noted in No. 3. 342 and others. F. P. C. 239. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 3. 346. Gunshot Injury of the Inner Condyle of the Femur. —Lower half of a right femur—macerated, to show the above. This wound was received at Corunna. Suppuration of the limb followed the injury, and extended among the muscles of the calf. The patient was exhausted by hectic fever when amputation was performed. In Sir Charles Bell's drawing of this specimen ("Operative Surgery," plate ii. fig. 1) the ball is seen lodged in the depression, in front of the inner condyle. The walls of the cavity have some necrotic fragments still adhering to them, but at other places the bony lining has been somewhat condensed. The outer shell of bone is splintered. B.

A musket ball had lodged in the back of the outer condyle at the battle of Waterloo.Gunshot Fractures of the Femur. 167 The back of the inner condyle is wanting, and a circular depression above it indicates where the bullet lay. Portions of the bone which formed the bed of the bullet have necrosed, and have been in process of separation. The joint had evidently been acutely inflamed, and the articular surfaces have been eroded. There is a small crust of new periosteal bone above and behind the condyles. F. P. C. 240. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 3. 348. Bullet lodged in the Condyles of the Femur.— Lower end of a femur—with the patella and adjacent parts of tibia and fibula dissected, and a section removed from the outer condyle to illustrate the above—in spirit. A Russian General, Baron Driesen, was struck by a musket-ball on the inner condyle of the left femur at the battle of Borodino on the 6th of September 1812. The ball lodged near the outer condyle. Inflammation and suppuration followed, causing great pain. Various attempts were made to remove the ball by dilating the wound with sponge tents but without success. During 1815 and until March 1816 the wound remained closed. At this time the parts became greatly swollen and very painful, the old wound reopened, and an abscess on the outer side was evacuated. Some improvement followed, and a German surgeon poured large quan- tities of mercury into the sinus in the hope of dissolving the bullet. This was followed by intense pain and numerous abscesses round the knee- joint. As these symptoms continued, the limb was amputated above the knee by Sir Charles Bell on the 7th of January 1817. For a time considerable pain and swelling remained in the stump, but these gradually subsided, and the Baron left London for St Petersburg in May of the same year. Sir Charles Bell found mercury lodged in different abscesses round the joint and inflammatory thickening round the popliteal nerves. Tho patella, femur, and tibia were anchylosed by bone. An encrustation round the bullet has obscured its metallic character, but indicates its position. (See Bell's "Surgical Observations," p. 431.) B. C. xvu. 38. . 349.

Bayonet Wound of the Lower End of a Femur.— Lower end of a right femur—macerated, showing the above. The bayonet wound was received at Waterloo. The leg was shattered, and required amputation above the knee. " Although, in this case, the question of amputation was decided by the shattered condition of the bones of the leg, the wound in the head of the femur (sic) is interesting to us, as being that which, although apparently slight, is attended with the most serious consequences. The wound is on that part of the bone, which implies that the point of the bayonet has penetrated the capsule of the joint. It was, in short, a punctured wound, which, if inflammation be not prevented, may be followed, as in the present instance, by suppuration within the joint" (Sir Charles Bell). [Instead of " inflammation," we would now say "sepsis."— C. W. C] There is an indentation by the bayonet on the side of the inner condyle. B- C- xvn" 37" 3. 352. Bullet Wound of the Head of the Tibia.-Upper half of a right tibia—macerated, showing the above. The round bullet which lodged at the back has been wired in position. The wound was received at Corunna.169 Gunshot Fractures of the Tibia. " There was here, of course, a breach of the capsule of the joint. The consequences were great swelling of the whole extremity, matter in a cavity of the knee-joint, and a diffused abscess under the gastro-cnemii. The limb was properly amputated. This was from Corunna. It led me to expect what I saw afterwards at Waterloo " (Sir Charles Bell). * It should be noted that the wound of entrance is smaller than the bullet, also that the wound of exit is the larger and more irregular of the two. Some splinters of bone have been loosened at the wound of exit, and a fissure extends down- wards for about four inches. See Sir C. Bell's "Operative Surgery," pi. ii. fig. 2, and pi. xi. B.

The inner tuberosity, which had been shot off, is wired in position. The specimen was taken from a soldier who fought at Waterloo. The ball has apparently penetrated from within outwards, and has also split off the inner tuberosity. The bone in the track of the bullet has been necrotic, and evidently inflammation and suppuration have attacked the knee-joint. The articular- surface is rough and opened out, and the surface of the bone generally is in a similar condition. F. P. C. 244 Presented by Professor John Thomson. •3.355.

" The ball passed through the head of the tibia, and must have broken upon the continuity of the capsular membrane; but this man got so well as to have been brought up to Yoik Hospital for the purpose of being examined for a pension* when irritation and inflammation commenced, which made it neces- sary to amputate " (Sir Charles Bell). The bullet has perforated, without splitting, the front of the head. New bone has been formed round the openings, especially on the outer side, and also on the front of the tibia for about three inches below the injured spot. There is a slight deposit on the head of the fibula. B. C. xvn. 30i 3. 356.

The wound was received at the battle of Waterloo. Abscess and caries made amputation necessary. The bullet, which is a round one, is lodged intact m a large cavity in the cancellous tissue at the back of the upper end of the bone. On the front of the shaft a large part of the compact tissue has necrosed. This dead piece has been partially separated above, while below its surface has- been partly absorbed by granulations, and is in consequence very rough. A piece cut out of it shows that the separation was also" proceeding from below. The rest of the shaft, especially at the back, is encrusted with new periosteal bone. Apparently,, therefore, an acute osteo-myelitis following the injury produced by the bullet has ended in necrosis. B. C. xvn. 32.. 3. 357.

Bullet lodged in the Knee, followed by Tuberculosis. Upper end of a right tibia—macerated, showing the above. A bullet is wired in position on the top of the outer tuberosity. The articular surface is very irregular, being occupied by excavations. The walls of these are opened out, although one at the back shows signs of healing. On the outer condyle an island of necrotic bone remains, with its articular surface unchanged, and surrounded by a deep trench. At one or two other places similar though smaller islands are seen. These appearances are identical with those seen in advanced tuber- cular disease. The surface of the bone below the articulation is much roughened by newly formed periosteal bone. This indicates that sepsis has accompanied the tubercular process. F. P. C. 245. 359. Gunshot Fracture of the Tibia and Fibula.— Right tibia and fibula—macerated, showing the above.

It may be noted that while the part of the tibia struck by the ball has been comminuted into small pieces, the remaining portions of the shaft are unaffected, with the exception of one fissure on the lower piece. A slight crust of new periosteal bone has formed on the main portions of the shaft, as in the previous case. C. xvn. 45. 3. 361.

Indeed, if the majority of these cases of gunshot fracture had been treated early, and free incisions made down to the bone, many of them might have done well, without amputation. It was the circumstances in which they were found that made amputation necessary, and at the same time almost a hopeless measure" (Sir Charles Bell). The fibula is broken irregularly, and the tibia comminuted. The comminution of the tibia, however, is less than in the previous specimens, but the splitting of the remaining portions of the shaft is somewhat more extensive. A layer of newly formed periosteal bone, slightly thicker than in the preceding specimens, is seen above and below the seat of injury. B. C. xvn. 47. 364.

No union whatever seemed to have taken place, which opinion was confirmed on the 22nd by making an examination while the patient ■was under chloroform. As the patient was getting every day weaker, the limb was amputated on the 23rd, above the seat of fracture. Although still weak, he continued to improve for two weeks, and hopes were entertained that he would do well. Unfortunately, hectic fever came on, and he sank about a month after the amputation." (Vide "Edinburgh Medical Journal," January 1857.) The fracture has been about the middle of the shaft, and the bone has been severely comminuted. Upon two of the fragments, at the outer side, there is the appearance of a circular aperture, possibly where the bone was struck. These two fragments, as well as others near, have necrosed, and have been separated from the surrounding bone by granulation. Upon the main piece of the shaft, near the seat of fracture, a few spicules of necrosis in process of separation are seen, and also an irregular crust of periosteal bone, which in some places is heaped up to a considerable height. q. q 2415 Presented by David Greig, F.R.C.S.E., Dundee.

The front aperture is the larger, but pieces of bone split off near the back aperture have been reuniting in their original position, thus making it seem unduly small. The bone is fissured into the knee-joint, and for about six inches down the shaft. There is new periosteal bone round the seat of injury and partly filling up the fissures. These changes must have occupied several weeks. G- Presented by Surgeon-General Billings, U.S.A. 3 386 Gunshot Fracture through the Tuberosity of the T^bia -UPP- end of a left tibia-macerated. The injury is similar to the last. The bullet has struck the tout of the outer tuberosffy and has emerged at the back of the iuuer tuberosity at a higher level.

The fibula is broken a little above the point where the bullet struck the tibia, and may have been secondary to the fracture of the tibia. Some new periosteal bone has formed at and near the injured places. The bullet evidently struck the tibia from the outer side, and carried away bone before it on the inside. Gr. C. 3431.

There is an irregular aperture in front of the tibia two inches above the articular surface. The margins are bevelled towards the inside. At the back of the bone opposite there is another aperture, somewhat smaller and more irregular than that in front, with its margins bevelled externally. The inner malleolus and half of the articular surface is split off from the rest of the bone, and the fissures extend upwards into the shaft for some inches above the seat of injury. The bullet has evidently struck the leg from the front and outer side, and has passed backwards and slightly downwards. G. C. 3432. Presented by Surgeon-General Billings, U.S.A. 3.389.

The neck of the bone has entirely disappeared, but at the seat of fracture much irregular new bone has been thrown out, and partly fills the hollow of the great trochanter. The adjacent surfaces of the remains of the head and of the root of the neck have been eburnated by friction. The remains of the head, which was loose, and is now attached to the bone by a wire, shows great irregularity of the articular surface. These changes resemble those found in arthritis deformans. G.

The inner margin of the glenoid cavity of the scapula is worn away, and the adjacent bone on the ventral surface is flat and smooth. The greater part of the articular surface of the humerus is irregular, °and covered by fibrous material. At the back of the neater tuberosity, the bone has been smoothed down by friction against the scapula, and near it there is a projecting spur of bone. Portion of a strong fibrous capsule is seen on the inner side of the head of the humerus. The bone forming the infra-spinatus fossa has been fractured, and has united with B C ii M 44 great irregularity. 5 4 Unreduced Sub-coracoid Dislocation of the Shoulder. -Eight scapula and humerus-macerated, showing the above. The specimen is from the same patient as the last. Evidently on this side also there has been an unreduced dislocation. The original glenoid cavity is partly filled up by newly formed bone, and a new cavity has been formed inside, and below the level of the first one. The head of the humerus shows many alterations. The greater and lesser tuberosities have atrophied, and their surfaces pass insensibly into those of the shaft and head respectively. The articular surface of the head is irregular, and a mass of new bone has been thrown out at the outer and back part of the surgical neck. The surface of this new piece is porous, and the intervals between the sma holes are at places eburnated. This ^^ J^^Jf often produced by arthritis deformans upon^e head of fl» femur. 5 5 Old-standing Sub-coracoid Dislocation of the 5- Shoulder.-^ scapula, *ith adjacent perils of the humerus aud clavicle, from a person aged 76 years.Dislocations of the Shoulder. 193 There is an unreduced sub-coracoid dislocation of the humerus, and the edge of the glenoid cavity has caused a ■depression upon the back of the anatomical neck. This part of the bone is elongated, so that the neck of this humerus almost resembles that of a femur. These changes may have been pro- duced by a splitting of the great tuberosity against the edge of the glenoid cavity at the time of the accident, and afterwards by absorption from pressure and some new formation. (See paper by Caird, "Edinburgh Medical Journal," 1886.) The original glenoid cavity is partially filled up, and an imperfect new one has been formed below the coracoid process. G. C. 3468.

The deltoid has been thrown down to expose the region of the shoulder. The head of the humerus was displaced backwards into the infraspinatus fossa, and is seen lying on the infraspinatus muscle. The capsule of the shoulder-joint and the attachment of all the muscles to the two tuberosities, except a small portion of the teres minor, were completely torn off. The surrounding muscles and areolar tissue were infiltrated with blood. Prepared by G. Hardyman, M.B. G. C. 3580. Presented by H. P. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 5. 9.

Four years before, the patient, a young man, then aged 20, had struck his knee in trying to jump into a cart. Several ineffectual attempts had been made to reduce the deformity. The joint subsequently became aflected with tubercular disease, and shortly after the cast was taken the joint was successfully excised by Mr A. G. Culter. (See Series 7.) The cast shows a slight outward dislocation of the tibia, but the relation of the parts was masked by swelling of the synovial membrane. q. q 2891 Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E.

Abnormal Development of Skeleton.—Skeleton of an Anencephalic male foetus—macerated, showing the ahove. The cranial bones are imperfectly developed, and the vault of the skull is very shallow and quite deficient at the vertex. The parietal bones are feebly developed, while there is a large gap corresponding to the foramen magnum. There are six digits on each hand and foot, the extra one being super- numerary to the fifth in each case. In both hands the extra digit arises from the fifth metacarpal bone, which is unduly broad. A similar arrangement is seen on the left foot, but on the right foot the fifth metatarsal bone is double. The radius on each side is somewhat bent and flattened, and the tibiee are broad and somewhat bent. In other respects the skeleton seems well developed. q. q 3494 Presented by Alexis Thomson, F.E.C.S.E, 1893. • Abnormal Development of Skeleton—Three photo- graphs of the above foetus, showing the appearances presented before dissection. The relative shortness of the lower limbs and their some- what inverted position should be noted. The bloated appear- ance of the features in the front and side views is clearly demon- strated, and in the profile view the relative smallness of the cranium and the protrusion of brain and membranes through the vertex is well shown.

The extra rib has a well-marked head, neck, and tubercule, with about one inch of a body, before it blends with the first rib. The place of junction is much flattened, and on the inner side is prolonged into a flattened spike, directed forwards and inwards. G. C. 35 II. CHANGES PRODUCED BY CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE NUTKITION OF BONE. A. Changes in old age. 6. 5 Change in the Humerus from Old Age-Upper end of a right humerus, in section-macerated, to show the above. The bone was very greasy, and was with difficulty cleaned of fat and oil. The compact tissue of the shaft is diminished in thickness. There is considerable atrophy of the cancellous tissue at the upper end, and the whole texture of the bone is lighter and more friable than in the adult condition The changes in this bone may be taken as characteristic of those found in the long bones of old people, when semle^ias appeared. Presented by Macdonald Brown, F.R.C.S.E.201 Senile Changes in Bone, 6. 6. Senile Osteo-malaeia of the Femur.—Longitudinal sections of the left femur of an old woman, showing the above. The patient was bed-ridden in the workhouse, and all her bones showed a similar change. The bone is much lighter and more fragile than usual, and in places at either end could easily be marked with the finger- nail. The outer wall of bone has been reduced to a mere shell, except at the upper end of the shaft, and there the bone tissue, although thicker than elsewhere, is opened out almost into cancellated tissue. The cancellated tissue at the extremities is extremely light and delicate, and in places has disappeared. On the surface the marks of muscular attachments are less prominent than usual, and in places the surface is porous. When fresh, the interior of the bone was filled by a reddish- brown jelly-like material which had replaced the marrow, except at the middle of the shaft. It was not greasy. The bone was easily macerated, and is quite dry, except at the lower end, where it is slightly oily. The angle which the neck forms with the shaft does not seem altered, possibly because the patient was bed-ridden some time before her death. G. C. 3222. Presented by Charles W.

A portion has been removed from the head of the tibia to show the condition of the cancellous tissue. The bones are very greasy, and were made only tolerably clean after having been several times boiled in soda solution. The patient had suffered from knee-joint disease, and many years before amputation the limb had become anchylosed in a flexed position. It was removed because it was in the way. The shafts of both bones are diminished in size, and are bent slightly backwards. The compact tissue, however, is strong, and the bones are apparently not lightened in proportion to their diminished size. The section through the cancellous tissue shows it to be stronger and firmer in the epiphyses than in the upper part of the shaft. The patella has been anchylosed by bone to the femur. The articular surfaces of the femur and tibia are irregular, but without any sign of existing active disease. The changes in these bones may be attributed partly to disuse and partly to other results of the previous knee-joint disease. Q q 3554 Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 13.

Atrophy of the Bones of Leg- and Foot from Disuse,204 Diseases of Bone. following- Anchylosis from Rheumatism.—Bones of a right leg and foot, soft parts cleaned off—dried, to show the above. D. W., aged 18 years, was troubled with pains in the joints of his right foot at the age of 10. Shortly after this he was confined to bed for three months with a "fever" (probably rheumatic), which affected all the joints of his body. Two years later he had a relapse of the same fever, with implication of most of his joints, especially those of the right foot. Since then he has had several similar attacks, and, with the exception of the sterno-clavicular and temporo-maxillary, all the joints of his body have become deformed and more or less rigid. He has thus been completely crippled and helpless, even in bed. The right knee was excised on 10th May, but as the operation was unsuccessful, Professor Annandale performed amputation above the kuee on 24th July. The muscles of the leg, although greatly diminished in bulk, were of a fairly good colour. The periosteum stripped off very easily. The shafts of the tibia and fibula are much reduced in thickness, and the muscular markings are slight. The compact tissue is hard, but the cancellous tissue at the articular ends of the long bones and in the tarsal bones is extremely soft and fatty, and is surrounded by a scale of bone so thin and soft that it yields to the slightest pressure, and can be cut with the finger-nail. The joints of the ankle and tarsus are all anchylosed by bone, as are also those of the metatarsus, except that of the first metatarsal bone. The joint between the first and second phalanges of the great toe is anchy- losed, but all the other phalangeal joints have a certain amount of movement. G- C- 3581 • Presented by Professor T.

Early in life his foot had been injured, and great distortion resulted (see G. C. 2818). The skin had been greatly destroyed, and an ulcer which appeared on the heel broke out from time to time, and caused so much inconvenience that on account of it the foot was at last amputated.205 Atrophy of Bone. The metatarsals are extremely thin, and are ossified together at their bases. The three cuneiforms and the scaphoid are also ossified together. The os calcis and the cuboid are widely separated. The cancellated tissue is very light, and in many places has disappeared. The bones were fairly easily cleared of fat. q q 2820 Presented by P. H. Maclaren, F.R.C.S.E.

The following description has been kindly furnished by the donor. , 1 /1ThiSIPeCim<5n °btained fr0m tlle body °f a woman aged 30 who d:ed m. the Norfolk County Asylum in 1891. Of a neurotic Lily' she was apparently healthy and well-formed at birth.

S "The skull is typically micro-cephalic; it is also asymme- trical, the right half of the cranial box being greater in its dimensions and more convexly arched than the left. This assymmetry is the result of a lesion in early life of the left cerebral hemisphere of the brain, whereby the growth of the latter was interfered with." The bones of the trunk and extremities present features which are to be etiologically associated with a right-sided206 Diseases of Bone. hemiplegia occurring in infancy, together with uninterrupted recumbency in bed for nearly thirty years. Those features specially connected with the hemiplegia show themselves, especially in the bones of the right arm and leg, and to a very much less extent in the trunk; those features resulting from the recumbency and disuse are superadded to the former on the right side, but are also present in those of the left. In the trunk there is no apparent asymmetry apart from the scoliosis. Those on the paralysed side do not suffer by comparison with those on the side which retained the power of movement. The spinal column exhibits a type of curvature seldom met with, and in all probability only developed under condi- tions present in this case, i.e. paralysis of one side plus recum- bency. That little movement took place during life is evidenced by the bony union of certain of the laminae. The thorax has altered during the preparation of the specimen; it was scarcely, if at all, involved in the scoliosis; it was well formed, beyond a moderate flattening from before backwards. The pelvis, of the female type, is most notably wasted and thinned; its diameters considerably altered. The bones of the extremities are on both sides small, thin, and light, deficient in ridges and marks for muscular attachment, present a fairly developed cortical layer in the shafts of the long bones; the medulla and spongiosa very small m amount. The articular ends of the long bones and the short bones (e.g. tarsus) have but a thin and imperfect cortex, capable of being indented with the finger-nail. The ends of the long bones also present alterations resulting from the deformities to be presently described. Those on the right (or paralysed) side not only present the above features in a greater degree, but show evidences of the nerve lesion. They are distinctly shorter. This, as shown by measurement, varies in the different bones. It is most pro- nounced in the following bones, and in the order given humerus, femur, fibula, radius, ulna, tibia, clavicle. ItAtrophy of Bone. 207 absent in the scapula, metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges. The bones on the right side are also less in girth than those on the left. The changes in the ends of the bones, resulting from the deformities acquired in early life, are met with both on the right and on the left side, though much more pronounced in these of the former or paralysed side. They reach their acme in the lower extremities. The right hip-joint presents a complete dorsal dislocation of the head of the femur, with corresponding changes in the articular surfaces; at the left side the dislocation is only partial. The right knee-joint is flexed to such a degree that the articular surf aces of the condyles are not in contact with the tibia; the facets of the latter are in contact with the superior aspect of the posterior extremities of either condyle. On the left side the flexion is less pronounced and the leg is rotated outwards. The right ankle-joint was acutely;flexed, remarkable—seeing that the toes of paralysed limbs are usually pointed: the superior surface of the neck of the astragalus articulated with the anterior aspect of the shaft of the tibia. On the left side the toes were pointed. In the upper extremities there are no evidences in the articular ends of the bones of the large joints of the contracture deformities on the right side, corresponding to those in the lower extremity. The articular surfaces remain in contact with each other, and are covered with hyaline cartilage. The hand, however, on the right side, preserved in its original conditions, presents the usual features of hemiplegic contracture. The brain.—See nervous system.

The limb was soaked in Mullet's fluid, which has turned the bones green. The patient had been affected by infantile paralysis. In conse- quence, this leg and foot did not grow in proportion to the other one, and became useless. It was therefore amputated. The bones are both somewhat bent outwards, as m fco. 6 12. The shafts of the tibia and fibula are thin, and the usual ridges are wanting. The compact tissue, however, is not atrophied in proportion to the diminished size.

The thickened bone is210 Diseases of Bone. spongy in character, and seems to occupy chiefly the middle and outer tahles. Upper Limbs.—The clavicles are thin, and their curves are somewhat exaggerated. Scapulaa.-The left scapula is small and thin, but otherwise normal in shape. The right is bent, so as to be concave forwards, but is otherwise unchanged. Own* to spinal curvature, it is placed higher than the left one. Humeri.—The humeri are each 8£ inches in length, and have an outward bend at the deltoid attachment, where also a special rid-e is developed. The outer lip of the bicepital groove is very prominent. The heads of the bones are flattened from above downwards. The condyles at the elbow are unusually prominent. Forearms—The bones of the forearms are thm and somewhat irregular in shape, with prominent ridges and enlarge- ment of the lower ends of radii. The bones of the hands show no particular change. Spinal Column.-The spinal column presents an exaggerated degree of lateral curvature, convex to the right in the dorsal region, and to the left in the lumbar, with the usual rotation of the bodies of the vertebra* towards the convexity. Thorax—The thorax presents the usua characters following upon lateral curvature, viz. on the right or convex side the angles of the ribs are exaggerated behind, and the ribs themselves seem unusually broad, while the curve is somewhat flattened in front; on the left or concave side the ribs are compressed together and narrowed at the concavity, their angles being flattened at the back and their curvature increased in front. Sternum.-The body of the sternum is oblique to the manubrium sterni. Pelvis-The pelvis is altered partly by rickets and partly by lateral curvature. The bones are thin and light. The al» of the ilium are iU developed and bent forward, somewhat like the osteo-malacian pelvis. The brim 0f the pelvis is contracted chiefly on the left side, where the acetabulum has been crushed up towards the sacrum. Lower LiMBS-Femora—The femora are very short, measuring from the top of the great trochanters to their lower end only about 9 inches. They are curved forwards and211 Richets. outwards, are rotated outwards, and are flattened and enlarged at their lower ends. Tibse and Fibulae.—The tibia? and fibulas are bent almost completely double, so that the knees must have touched the outside of the foot during life. The bones of the feet are comparatively unaltered. B. C. i. 3. M. 24. 26. Skeleton affected by Rickets.—Skeleton of a rickety woman (Christie Moore) showing alterations, chiefly in the limbs and pelvis. "She was the little woman, with rather a good face, and a great deal of impudence, who generally stood at the Infirmary gate to talk to the students. She went with great velocity on her crutches. She had no motion in her legs separately, they being twisted together curiously. This made it the more extraordinary that she ever suffered as she did in child-bed. She was pregnant twice, and the first child was brought away at the eight months entire, but flattened. In her second labour I saw her. She had gone the full time. When I examined the head of the child, I found it perforated, and one of the parietal bones brought away. After this, the other parietal bone was brought away by the use of the crochet. The hook was then put into the foramen magnum and the base of the skull brought down obliquely, but the operator with all his force could not bring it through. This was on the second day of her labour She was much exhausted. Her voice, however, was hale and strong, and she would talk in her usual style of impudence. She sank rather rapidly an d died undelivered. A model represents the appearance which presented on dissection." (See '1 Obstetrical Collection.") The pelvis is greatly flattened. "It measures, between the sacrum and pubis, two fingers' breadth only, or an inch and a half, the transverse diameter four inches and a quarter. The linea pectinia forms here a very sharp spine, as sharp as a paper-folder. This was the cause of death, for in attempting to bring the head through the pelvis, the womb was forced against the ridge, and being pressed continually, gave way, so that part of the child escaped through the rent in the womb. As in the following specimen, the arm-bone is shaped by the action of the deltoid muscle. The muscles of the shoulder were very powerful, and she took great pride in the rapidity of her progress."Discuses of Bone. 212 The skull is well shaped, with the hones somewhat irregularly thickened, although to a less degree than in the pre- vious specimen. The spine and thorax, as well as the scapula? and clavicles, show no marked change. The humeri are very irregular and short, with great development of the ridges, especially that of the deltoid, and marked prominence of the inner condyles. The hones of the fore-arm are small and some- what bent forward, especially on the right side, with an exaggeration of most of the bony ridges, and an enlargement of the lower ends of the radii. The pelvis, as already noted, Ls markedly flattened and rickety. The lower limbs are crossed. The femora are short, and have an outward bend at the upper end. The great trochanters are above the level of the head. The lower ends are enlarged, and the linea aspera are unusually prominent. The tibiae and fibulas are in their crossed position, bent upon themselves, with the convexity directed forwards and outwards relatively to the trunk, but really forwards and inwards in the usual anatomical sense of the word. When the legs are much crossed the soles of the feet look downwards, the insides being, of course, to the outside. The tibiae and fibula? are, as usual, laterally flattened at the bend, considerable bone being thrown out in the concavity of the curve. The bones of the feet are soft and light, B. C. i. 3. M. 23. 6. 27. Skeleton affected by Rickets.—Skeleton of an adult woman, showing changes chiefly in the spine, pelvis, and lower limbs. Thorax and spine show changes characteristic of lateral curvature, with convexity to the right in the mid-dorsal region. The bodies of the vertebrae are, as usual, rotated towards the convexity, and the right side of the chest is raised, carrying the scapula with it. In the concavity of the curve the bodies of the vertebrae are greatly compressed and fused together, the corresponding libs being also compressed and anchylosed [to the vertebrae, ar.d their angles flattened. On the convex sideRickets. 213 the angles of the ribs are as usual unduly prominent. The lumbar spine is comparatively unaltered. The pelvis is flattened from before backwards, and the lower end of the sacrum and coccyx project into the outlet. Lower Limbs.—The bones of the right leg are longer and better developed than those of the left. The femora on both sides are curved forward near the upper end. The tibiae and fibula? are bent forwards and inwards, this change being specially seen on the left side, where the shape of the fibula reminds one of an Australian boomerang, and has been firmly pressed against the tibia. There is a very marked projection on the outer side of the os calcis on either side. The bones of the upper limbs are not so much distorted as those of the lower. They show a certain degree, especially in the humeri, of the alteration noted in the previous skeleton, but the changes are much less than in the lower limbs. The right radius seems to have sustained a Colles' fracture. B. C. i. 3. M. 28. ft. 28. Skeleton affected by Rickets.—Skeleton of an adult woman—macerated, showing rickety changes in the lower limbs and pelvis. There is a very slight lateral dorsal curve, not sufficient to have distinctly altered the thorax. The pelvis is somewhat flattened from before backwards. In the lower limbs the femora are curved forwards and outwards at the upper ends, and the linea aspera in each case is remarkably prominent. The tibia? and fibuke are bent inwards about the middle, with the usual ridges on the concavity.

(Note in Dr P. H. Handyside's handwritten the back of the Painting.) ° The following particulars as to the "Black Dwarf" are taken from Dr Craig's letter to Dr John Brown, which forms part of the article "The Black Dwarf's Bones," in the Hora) Subsecivce (1882 ; second series, p. 344).

"He had never a shoe on his feet; the parts on which he walked were rolled in rags, old stockings, etc., but the toes always bare, even in the most severe weather. His mode of progressing was as extraordinary as his shape. He carried a long pole, or 'kent,' like the alpenstock, tolerably polished, with a turned top on it, on which he rested, placed it before him, he then lifted one leg, something in the manner that the oar of a boat is worked, and then the other, next advanced his staff, and repeated the operation, by diligently doing which he was able to make not very slow progress.-He frequently walked to Peebles, four miles, and back again, in one day. : His arms had no motion at the elbow-joints, but were active enough otherwise.

"A skeleton of great value. In procuring this skeleton I lost my- self for two hours, and found myself at two o'clock in the morning in the court before Peunycuick House. "This skeleton differs from the others, being distorted by the disease called mollities ossium. In this woman the disease continued for many years. It was attended with incessant pain in the bones, and a deposition of the phosphate of lime from the urine ; but what was most remarkable in the case, was the many children she had, with increasing difficulties in the labours, until at length the bones of the pelvis were so closed that it was necessary to perform the Ctesarean section upon her. '' She had a cross-birth, the belly of the child protruding. She had a child with a dangerous flooding. She had a child brought away by embryulcio and the crotchet. The disease proceeded, and the distortion of the pelvis increased. She became pregnant again, and it was necessary to bring the child away piecemeal. In this operation the surgeon seems to have conducted himself with great good sense, dexterity, and persever- ance. His strength was exhausted by the exertion, so that for two days after the operation his hands and arms were benumbed. She suffered also in this painful operation, and was left for dead, and was long insensible, so that they were about to prepare her death-clothes. " She recovered and became a seventh time pregnant. The surgeon who had previously attended her now refused to attempt the extraction of the child by the crotchet. The disease in the meantime had made progress, and the pelvis was much more distorted. When I examined her on the approach of labour, the womb hung forward, so that the integuments of the belly made a tumour like a great scrotal hernia betwixt the thighs. On examination per vaginam, the promontory of the sacrum presented in the middle of the passage, and only one finger could be passed through the pelvis, with which nothing could be felt. As for the child, it lay in a manner out of the pelvis. (For a full account of the case and operation, see the fourth volume of the Medico-Chirur-ical Transactions.) The mother died, but the child lived, being the only one out of seven that was born alive. "Dissection.— Two large masses of coagula lay in the belly The cavity of the womb was filled with blood. Strings of coagula reached from the mouths of the sinuses of the womb to these coagula, as if the streaming blood had been arrested and coagulated while flowing The uterus was not contracted and the edge of the incision into it was everted as if paralytic, with the mouths of the vessels open upon it. She died of hajmorrhage. " Descriptio7i of the Skeleton.—The bones were all soft,222 Diseases of Bone. covered with, their periosteum, which was not easily separated, and in endeavouring to separate it the knife went into the bone. She had lain in bed for the last two or three years, and therefore the spine, the thorax, and the pelvis are the parts most distorted. The arms and legs are those of a tall woman. From the occiput to the edge of the ilium is less than ten inches. The femur measures sixteen inches, yet on each side it is a little shortened by the neck being at right angles with the rest of the bone, so as to make the lesser trochanter almost touch the ilium. The lower vertebrae of the neck and upper vertebras of the back protrude backwards almost at right angles, and the lower vertebras of the back and loins make a great protrusion forwards. There is a remarkable indentation in the middle of the ribs on the right side, and those on the outer side are very much compressed and irregular. This was evidently caused by the muscles of respiration on the softened ribs. « Measurement of the Pelvis.— That which at first appears as the projection of the sacrum is the bodies of the three lower lumbar vertebrae fallen forward so as to occupy the cavity of the pelvis The sacrum has receded. From the promontory of the sacrum to that part of the brim of the pelvis opposite to the left acetabulum is something less than a quarter of an inch. From the right side of the promontory of the sacrum to the linea innominata is half an inch. The foreBnger can here with difficulty be introduced between the bones; from the sacrum to the symphysis of the os pubis is two and a fifth inches. There is one part, and only one part of the brim, which admits a ball of an inch in diameter to rest in it. The ball will nowhere pass through. Where it lies it rests against these points-the fourth vertebrae of the loins, and the bodies of the two ossa pubes The sacrum has suffered severely by her continually resting upon it. It is so bent that the base and angle of the bone approach within half an inch of each other The outlet of the pelvis would also be considered remarkably _ distorted ™ not the attention fixed upon the uni^to^oHhe brim."Osteo-Malacia. 223 53. Osteo-malacian Pelvis.—Plaster cast of a pelvis, along with the lumbar vertebra? and upper ends of the femora, showing the above. "Elizabeth Thomson, aged 32, was the mother of three children. Her first labour was natural, and the child born alive. She soon became affected with symptoms of malacosteon, and two years from this labour, required, in her second confinement, the use of the crotchet. In her third labour, which happened in June 1779, she submitted to the Caesarean section, which was performed by Thomas Wood, Manchester. The child was alive, and the mother survived the operation seventy-six hours." (For the case see Mem. Medical Society of London, vol. v.) The spine has been bent to the left, and the vertebra are rotated in the usual way. The pelvis is compressed laterally in front, and the lumbar vertebra? project into its brim. The alse of the ilium are crushed forward. The pubic arch is greatly compressed, and the lower piece of the sacrum and the coccyx are flattened towards the upper part of the sacrum. This is a good example of the " beaked " or osteo-malacian pelvis. G. C. 1475. Presented by T. Kadford, Esq., through W. Campbell, F.R.C.S.E. 54.

The pains continued, and the right thigh and leg became more and more distorted, followed by a similar change in the left thigh and leg. His appetite remained good. His urine, for about two years, " deposited a whitish sediment, which, upon evaporation, became like mortar." He became gradually weaker, and died on 18th February 1775. At the post-mortem examination all the bones of the body were quite soft, and easily cut with a knife. "All these originally bony parts consisted of a mere cortical or outside osseous covering of the thickness of rind of cheese, and of an inside flesh-coloured mass." (See "Medical Observations and Enquiries" by a Society of Physicians in London: Taper by Mr Henry Thomson ; vol. v. p. 259.)

Both bones, but especially the fibula, show considerable thickening and new periosteal formation. The surface of the fibula is covered with irregular stalactite processes, which to a certain extent follow the line of attachment of the interosseous membrane and of the inter-muscular septa; but there is also considerable thickening on the subcutaneous area above, the outer malleolus.

The patient, a middle-aged man, had suffered from ulcer of the leg for many years. Owing to the intractable character of the ulcer, the leg was amputated by Mr John Duncan. The development of bone here also takes the form chiefly of irregular processes, following the inter-muscular septa. On the tibia there is, however, a considerable development on that part which lay beneath the ulcer, especially upon the front and on the outer surface, while smaller irregular patches can be seen at other places, even down to the inner malleolus. On the fibula the bony outgrowths are more prominent, the greater part, however, being toward the lower end of the bone. As in the previous case, the bony outgrowths are by no means limited to the part which lay immediately beneath the ulcer. G. C. 3186. Presented by John Duncan, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 64.

There is great periosteal development on the surface of both bones, especially at their lower ends. On the outer side of the lower end of the fibula the surface is porous, and has evidently formed part of the floor of an extensive ulcer. This surface presents a striking contrast to that of the other portions of both bones. At other places the character of the outgrowths and the condition of the surface is similar to that seen in jSTos. 6. 61 and 6. 63. It should be noted that at the lower end of the fibula, besides the thickening of the bone and the porous character of the surface, there are at one or two places distinct depressions or erosions. It would appear, therefore, that the ulcer as it progressed and deepened had first induced the bony outgrowth, then opened out its surface, and finally had begun to attack it. jr p q 433 Presented by Professor John Thomson. * 68.

This bone, especially near its lower end, is greatly thickened, and its surface is covered by irregular foliacious masses. The tibia shows, about five inches from its lower end, a very marked node, with a portion pro- jecting shelf-like towards the fibula. The surface of this node, as well as the surfaces of some of the irregular projections on the fibula at a lower level, are porous, and probably formed the base of an extensive ulcer.

The tibia is also enlarged towards its lower end, but to a less extent. From the point of anchylosis downwards, the axis of each bone inclines slightly forwards. Possibly, therefore, this has been a case of fracture, followed afterwards by ulceration of the soft parts, and consequent periostitic development on the surface. B. C. i. 5. M. 67. 74.

Portions of five ribs—macerated, to show the above. T. W., a sailor, 26 years of age, was admitted to Ward 18, Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on 3rd April 1890. He had good health till 8} months previously, when he had measles, followed by cold with rigors and pleurisy. " The left side of the chest swelled up." Breathing was very difficult, and the patient very weak. Three weeks later the pleura was incised, and three pints of what seems to have been pus evacuated. When he was admitted, there were several septic sinuses near the inferior angle of the scapula leading down to bare bone on the fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs, and communicating with the pleural cavity. Mr Cathcart removed portions of five ribs, and the patient made a good recovery. The sections show the original outline of the ribs, with new bone on their inner surfaces. In some places the new bone is compact; in others it is cancellous, with a compact lining. G. C. 3175. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E. 2.

As the boy's pulse and temperature continued high, the leg was amputated above the knee, one week after his admission. The knee-joint was found to be suppurating. The specimen shows almost complete separation of the periosteum, except at the lower and slightly at the upper ends of the tibia. It also illustrates the very free incision required for such cases.

Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis of the Tibia— Amputation.—Section of the injected right tibia of a girl—in spirit, showing the above. About Christmas 1889, Agnes R., aged 12 years, blistered a part of her heel, which soon became inflamed and irritable. This was poulticed and then improved. About the 8th of January 1890, her ankle "gave way ' while she was skating, and became afterwards swollen and painful. The swelling, which was at [first near the ankle, afterwards extended to the knee. Shortly afterwards an abscess was opened over the inner malleolus, and speedily others formed, and were opened higher up the leg. Eventually the ankle-joint communicated with one of the abscesses, and the tissues of the leg generally became inflamed. She was admitted to Ward 17, Royal Infirmary, on January 30th, 1890, and shortly afterwards the leg was amputated, just above the knee. A few days later an abscess formed on each shoulder, and that on the left was followed by considerable necrosis of the upper end of the humerus. Similar abscesses formed over each olecranon process. She was greatly emaciated, and after remaining in Hospital for many weeks, was sent to the Incurable Hospital, where she died some weeks afterwards. The specimen shows purulent infiltration through nearly the whole of the medullary cavity of the tibia.

In a few days the pain subsided, and a large abscess formed round the hip, and projected at the back. It was opened and drained, but the child died suddenly next day, apparently from a clot in the heart. No post-mortem examination could be obtained. The specimen shows that the bone has been opened out and softened on the front of the neck within the capsule. This accounts for the synovitis, which must have been suppura- tive. Had the child lived, necrosis of the part below the upper epiphysis might have followed. G. C. 3319. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1891.Caries from Pus-forming Organisms. 235 6. 83. Acute Suppurative Inflammation in the Lower Epiphysis of the Femur (Acute Epiphysitis).—Outer half of the right knee of a boy aged four—injected, aud in spirit, showing the effects of the above. J. G. was admitted to "Ward 18 on the 12th February 1890. He had a satisfactory family history and good previous health. About the beginning of January he had been suddenly seized with a severe pain in the right knee when asleep, and the leg became firmly flexed. This subsided, but was followed by frequent muscular spasms, producing complete flexion and great pain. These increased in severity, and became worse at night. A swelling then appeared in the region of the knee, and these attacks ceased. On admission, he was very weak and thin. The limb was flexed, but could be straightened, and there was considerable swelling in the region of the knee, with pain and tenderness limited to the lower parts of the femur. The knee was treated by extension, afterwards by Scott's dressing and a plaster case. On removing these there were pains on the inner side over the epiphysis, and thickening of the synovial membrane. On the 11th March the painful spot was incised and pus escaped. No bare bone. Uth March.— The temperature, pain, and swelling were worse, and the wound was 1' septic." 20th March.— Explored and a necrosis of the femur diagnosed. Part of the epiphyseal cartilage was diseased. The joint was opened into and drained. April 1.—The patient has been going down-hill, suffering from septicemia, so Mr Cathcart amputated through the thigh. The patient recovered. The softening and destruction of the epiphysis and adjacent portion of the shaft is distinct. An abscess had started to burrow up into the popliteal space. G. C. 3179. Presented bij Charles W.

Acute Suppurative Inflammation of the Lower End of the Femur, with Erosion and Rarefaction.— Lower end of the shaft of a right femur (epiphysis wanting) —macerated, showing the above. "The patient, G. Y., aged 16, stated that, seven weeks ago, while walking, he was tripped, and his knee came in contact with a small stone. This caused no visible injury. He continued walking for two days after, when his knee swelled and became extremely painful. These symptoms, accompanied with much febrile irritation, continued for a month, during which time leeches and cold applications were first em- ployed, and afterwards poultices and fomentations.

From this opening matter continued to flow in large quantities, till Monday last, when it had healed. His state of health had been gradually getting worse. " The knee, especially on its anterior part, is much swollen, and its surface somewhat red and exquisitely painful. The patella is anchylosed. In the cavity of the joint there is a collection of fluid, affording a very distinct sense of fluctuation. The knee is preserved in a semi-bent position, and its motions are altogether lost. At its upper and inner part there is a small cicatrix. The inferior part of the thigh is also swollen, and the foot frequently cedematous. Several glands in the right groin are enlarged and painful on pressure. His general health is much impaired. There is much emaciation and debility—pulse 125, small—appetite bad—frequent night sweats—tongue clean—bowels slow. 11 On examination, Dr Hunter found that the femur was enlarged and diseased about three inches below the trochanter major. On 25th inst. he slept some—pulse 132, small—some sweating during night—tongue clean—some thirst. The cicatrix was opened up to-day, and about ten ounces of sero-purulent matter was discharged from the course {sic) of the femur. " After admission the patient showed symptoms of septic poisoning. There was a very extensive discharge, and as he was getting weaker, it was thought better to amputate below the small trochanter, from which he made a good recovery." The lower half of the specimen is very irregular, showing small patches of necrosed bone, with depressions and erosions round about them and numerous holes. There is also some deposit of new periosteal bone in the neighbourhood. This seems to have been a case of advancing septic inflam- mation in the bone. G. C. 1004.

Acute Suppurative Inflammation of the Cranium.— Lower half of a cranium, lower jaw and first three cervical vertebras—macerated, showing the above. The patient, an old lady aged 75 years, had suffered from a most severe attack of erysipelas of the face and head, accompanied by very great oedema and swelling of the soft parts, and followed by their destruc- tion. Caries soon occurred on the mastoid process, and rapidly spread to the neighbouring bone. Ere long the carotid artery was laid bare, and was seen pulsating against a sharp portion of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It ruptured in a day or two, and fearful hemorrhage occurred. Dr Foulis at once stuffed up the large hole which had been formed in the side of the head by the destruction of the soft parts and bone with a lump of cotton wadding. This stopped the bleeding, and the lady lived for four days afterwards. The squamous and mastoid portions of the temporal bone, with the great wing and outer ptergyoid plate of the sphenoid as well as the condyle of the lower jaw, have disappeared. The surfaces of bone which lay next to the missing parts are rarefied and absorbed. The vertebras have evidently been injured in being removed, but parts of their surface have also been attacked by the disease. q q 2647 Presented by James Foulis, M.D. 87.

The specimen was obtained from a patient who died in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, in 1824, after a head injury, for which trephining had been performed. The cause of death was therefore probably pytemia in the course of which an abscess had formed in the sternum233 Diseases of Bone.

A portion of the new shell has been removed, to expose the condition of the original surface. The periosteal crust is about a quarter of an inch thick, while the original compact tissue is opened out and partly absorbed.

The medullary cavity is partially filled up by newly-formed cancellous tissue. Opposite this place,- on the outer side, the compact tissue has been opened out. On the surface much new bone has been formed, so as to produce a considerable thicken- in- which gradually fades off into a thin periosteal crust upon the'other parts of the shaft.

The bone is much curved forwards near its lower end, and is correspondingly flattened from side to side. The posterior aspect of the bone is very rough and irregular, but the surface elsewhere is smooth, except where there are impressions left by blood-vessels. This seems to have been a case where chronic ostitis had led to softening and yielding of the bone, with sub- sequent solidification. "W. C. G. 34 6. 91.

There is great thickening of the bone and extraordinary irregularity of its surface. Along the back, and on all aspects of the upper third, the surface is thrown out into large irregular pro- cesses and plates, a condition which is also seen, to a less extent, along the front, The medullary cavity is completely filled up by cancellated tissue, except for about an inch near the upper end. At the junction of the upper and middle thirds the new bone shows several irregular cavities communicating posterially with the surface. These have probably been due to localised suppuration or minute necroses. One or two similar cavities are seen scattered throughout the bones.

The lower end of the tibia is much enlarged, and there is a cavity in the interior extending half-way up the bone, but partially interrupted by cancellous tissue. The enlarged part of the bone has been trephined, and the upper end of the cavity has been reached, but drainage has evidently been incomplete, for the lower portion of the cavity communicates by only a narrow aperture with the trephine hole, and is enlarged. The periosteal thickening of the tibia corresponds to the cavity inside. The fibula is enlarged about its middle, and especially on the inner aspect. Q 3212 Fresentecl by A. G.

The surface of the tibia on the lower two-thirds shows- considerable alteration. A large node-like swelling is seen in front, about the middle. Below this there is a considerable deficiency, with an aperture leading from it into a cavity situated above the lower articular surface. The walls of the cavity are lined by cancellated tissue, with only slight thicken- ing round the sides. The bone tissue however, above and below the cavity, is condensed. The upper end of the bone seems normal. The fibula is thickened near the affected part of the tibia. The appearances are not typical of an ordinary bone abscess, and the condition may have been tubercular. F. P. C. 423. 98.

"A little iu front of the right malleolus externus there is the orifice of a sinus which runs underneath the extensor tendons, and terminates by .another opening a little below the inner malleolus. From both of these orifices the probe may be passed into the articulation of the astragalus and tibia, the articulating surfaces of which bones are felt rough ; discharge copious but healthy ; the motions of the joint are very confined and the surrounding parts much swelled and slightly inflamed. General health pretty good ; pulse 100 ; tongue a little furred ; slight sweating ; bowels rather costive.' The leg was amputated by the single flap operation two or three ■days after his admission, and he made a good recovery. When fresh, "the tibia was dry, of a deadly whiteness, and not a particle of blood or of marrow oozing from its cut surface." " The tibia appears to have been the seat of long-standing and inveterate disease. This bone is enlarged throughout its whole length, but more particularly at its extremities, and on laying it open by a longitudinal section you observe its whole medullary cavity occupied by osseous depositions. ' This internal structure has been in several places the seat of caries, or, perhaps, I should rather say, of internal abscesses. A small one is observable just at the point where the bone was cut across in removing the limb, another immediately below this point, a third towards the middle of the bone, and a fourth very large cavity is situated in the distal extremity of the tibia immediately above its junction with the astragalus. This cavity, in the recent state, contained a quantity of purulent matter. It opens in front by a circular aperture immediately over the ankle joint, and it was, I suspect, into this opening that the probe passed when I conceived it to be going into the cavity of the joint. On the posterior surface of the bone, nearly opposite to the seat of this abscess, you will find some adventitious deposition of ossific matter in a stalactitic form. The fibula scarcely presents anything worthy of notice. Its lower extremity is divested of its articular cartilage, and apparently roughened, but whether this is the effect of disease or maceration is not very easily determined." (Sir George Ballingall's Clinical Lectures, No. 4, p. 18.) The pockets on the wall of the lowest abscess cavity m the tibia resemble somewhat the results of tubercular invasion, butBone Abscess. 243 the history of the case seems to point sufficiently clearly to the agency of pus-forming organisms.

The articular surface of the astragalus seems to have been affected more from the anchylosis than from the actual dis- ease. Some of the roughness on it may have been caused in process of preparation. q. q ^ 119 Presented by Sir George Ballingall. 6.100.

The integu- ments were everywhere sound. On the anterior and somewhat inner aspect of the limb a circular opening, rather more than an inch in diameter, led into the interior of the bony case. The integuments passed into the opening for a short way, passing insensibly into a soft mucous-looking membrane lining the whole interior of the osseous case, and seemingly occupying the centre of the tibia. These facts were observed before any dissection, on merely removing the plug mentioned in the case above, which the patient used to insert and withdraw at pleasure, so as to allow of the escape of matter and the washing out of the cavity. On dissecting the limb, these conjectures, as far as they regarded the nature of the tumour, were found to be correct. A section of the tibia in its long axis showed the upper part of the tibia dilated into an enormous cavity, capacious enough to contain sixteen and a half ounces of fluid,' lined throughout by the membrane already spoken of, and communicating externally by means of the aperture, which the patient was in the habit of plugging up. The lower portion of •the tibia was quite sound, and scarcely, if at all, altered from its natural appearance. The medullary cavity of this sound portion did not communicate with the diseased cavity above *or do the walls of the cavity itself present any very remarkable or diseased appearance, and they are of considerable thickness Of the surrounding soft parts-muscles, nerves, arteries, etc -it may be said that they were perfectly healthy. The muscles which ran over the tumour were put greatly on the stretch, but in all respects quite healthy. Indeed, the change affecting the tibia was limited entirely to itself, nor did the periosteum covering it show any diseased appearance or change of structure." The following points may be noted on this macerated portion. The inner wall of the cavity presents a surface formed of opened-out, carious-looking bone, showing at some places necrotic and almost loose portions, and at others irregu- ar pockets, probably resulting from the separation of necrosed fragments. The wall of the cavity, which varies from one-246 Diseases of Bone. quarter inch to one inch and a quarter in thickness, is chiefly formed of porous bone, but it is more condensed externally, and is densely compact where it joins the shaft. At the upper end the wall itself has been the seat of one or two- small abscesses. The outer surface of the expanded portion and of the shaft below is thrown into the irregular plates characteristic of chronic periosteal irritation. The fibula has a few bony spicules upon its inner surface, but it is chiefly remarkable in having been gradually flattened out, and bent so as to fit on to the adjacent surface of the expanded tibia. The cavity has evidently been formed by new growth on the outer surface, with absorption from within. G. C. 1219. Presented by Professor James Russell. 6. 102.

Some of these have never healed, and he has had two subsequent attacks of erysipelas. Was in the House from March 23rd to April 16th. Dismissed by desire." On his second admission, "the whole of the right fore-arm is swelled and particularly tender, especially at the elbow and wrist, where the enlargement is equable and very hard, and where there are sinous openings leading down to the bone. The granulations at the mouths of these are prominent, and there is a fungus forming over the carpus a large irregular unhealthy ulcer. The joints appear anchylosed ; motions of the hand, which is distorted inwards, lost. The attempt to move the hand in any direction attended with great pain.

There is a fracture about the middle of the bone, which may have been a compound one, and therefore possibly the starting-point of the disease. A large portion of the whole thickness of the shaft below the fracture is smooth, and evidently has necrosed. It has been in process of separation from the bone below. Above the fracture, for some distance, there has been some periosteal new growth. Just below the level of the small trochanter the bone has been entirely destroyed. Loose fragments of necrosed bone are seen here and there at the upper end of the shaft. The substance of the bone above this- point has been softened and partially absorbed, and has been separated into distinct pieces, some evidently necrotic. The whole bone, with the exception of the lower epiphysis, seem* to have been affected. This specimen, like the last, illustrates what might be called septic caries and septic necrosis. If it were certain that the disease in this case had resulted from a compound fracture, this specimen would have been placed in group B, i.e. among those in which pus-forming, organisms have attacked the bones through wounds.

Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis of the Femur- Necrosis, Fracture.—Lower half of the right femur of a lad, aged 18—macerated, to show the above. Three years before amputation a large abscess formed in the patient's right thigh. This was opened, but had continued to discharge for six months, when he fell and fractured the affected femur. Union took place, but at an obtuse angle, and the previous discharge of matter continued. A probe when passed into the opening came in contact with bone, but no loose portion could be discovered previous to the amputation. This difficulty was afterwards explained when it was found that the sequestrum had been covered posteriorly by a mass of semi-cartilaginous substance fully an inch in depth, which occupied the popliteal space, and was distinctly continuous with the thickened periosteum. At the back of the preparation there is a large sequestrum, loose, but partially surrounded by the neighbouring new shell. The lower end of the shaft, which is for the most part of new formation, is curved forwards just in front of the sequestrum. The latter has evidently been pressing against the bone above and below the bend, and thus must have acted mechanically in preventing the bend from increasing. The surface of the new shell blends with the original bone at the knee and towards the middle of the shaft. G. C. 2111. Presented by Benjamin Bell, F.R.C.S.E., 1840. 6. 116. Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis of the Femur- Necrosis, Anchylosis of the Knee, and Atrophy of the Tibia.—Section of the lower end of a femur and upper end of a tibia—macerated, to show the above. The patient, a young person, suffered about two years before amputa- tion from acute suppuration and inflammation of the femur, which ended n necrosis. He had not been treated, and had lain with his knee very irflexed. Amputation was performed through the thigh by Pro- fessor Annandale. The specimen shows a sequestrum in the femur, lying now loose in a cavity, with considerable development of new bone near and partially surrounding it.

The bone forming the upper end of the tibia is reduced to a shell with numerous apertures in it. The shaft of the tibia is also reduced to a hollow and fragile shell, which in many places is perforated by apertures. The contrast between the atrophy of the tibia and the new bone development round the sequestrum in the femur is very striking. G. C. 3499. Presented bij Alexis Thomson, F.E.C.S.E., 1893. 6.117.

Near the lower end of the shaft of the femur the new bone is shown opened out in texture and the epiphysis and adjacent part of the shaft entirely occupied by a brown fatty material. The same substance is seen in the section of the patella and tibia. The cancellated tissue in the tibia is entirely absorbed and the bony shell is very thin.

At one part the new case is deficient and the sequestrum exposed. At other places cloacae are seen. On the side opposite the deficiency an attempt was made to destroy the new bone by the actual cautery, in order to remove the sequestrum.

Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis—Necrosis, Chronic Enlargement.—Section of a part of a femur— macerated, illustrating the above. The new bone in most places is as dense as ivory, while at other parts it is cancellous. Several cloacal apertures communi- cate between the surface and the cavities within. In one of these cavities a loose fragment of dead bone is seen. The others have probably contained similar fragments, which have dropped out. The walls of the cavities are porous, and might be called carious. They have been covered with granulations, from which suppuration has come. The outer surface of the bone presents the usual irregular character seen in such cases due to the active development of new periosteal bone. This specimen shows by the density of the new bone how extremely difficult it is in some cases to remove enclosed sequestra. B. C. i. 5- M. 40.Necrosis from Pus-forming Organisms. 255 6. 121. Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis of the Tibia- Necrosis, great periosteal Enlargement, Amputa- tion.—Left tibia, showing an enormously thickened case of new bone round necrosed fragments. "James B., aged 20, labourer, admitted to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, November 1825. '' Three years before amputation the disease commenced without auy cause, and with a very severe pain. Inflammation, swelling, and suppura- tion ensued a year after this. A piece of bone was discharged. The sinuses have gradually increased in number, from which a great quantity of small bones have been discharged. His general health began to suffer about three months before amputation. " On 20th November 1825 the following was observed. Upon the anterior part of his left leg are numerous small ulcerations, all of which lead down to the tibia, which can be felt to be in a state of caries. The limb, particularly at its lower part, is swollen and altered in form. From the sinuses there is a great discharge of pus, of a very foetid odour. He experiences a constant dull pain. His general health is very much im- paired, and his strength much reduced. Pulse 100. Frequent shivering and flushing of the countenance. Incessant thirst, tongue red, bowels loose. " The limb was amputated through the thigh, but the patient died of septicemia and secondary hfemorrhage." This is a beautiful example of a new periosteal shell formed round necrosed fragments. Numerous cloacal apertures may be observed, especially along the inner surface of the bone, and sequestra can be seen through these apertures, lying loose, but imprisoned within the new shell. G.

Upon the front of the preparation there is a considerable excavation, and in a crevice at its lower end there is a small loose scale of necrosed bone. The appearance of excavation is evidently due to irregular development of new bone round a superficial necrosis, which has now disappeared. Tbis was formerly described as an ulcer of the tibia. If an ulcer of the skin had been present over the affected part of the tibia, as is probable, the ulcer in this case will have been secondary to the bone disease. B. C. r. 5.

A portion, nearly three inches in length, is wanting from the lower end of the shaft of the tibia. The upper fragment of the tibia is for the most part irregular, but the surfaces are smoothed over. The upper end of the lower fragment is much rarefied. The fibula is much thickened, especially near the middle, by irregular deposits of bone on the surface. Opposite the deficiency in the tibia, however, the surface of the fibula is rarefied and has been partly absorbed. Probably in this case there has originally been septic osteo- myelitis and necrosis, followed by a foul-spreading ulcer.

The new tibia is curved forward, and is thickened, especially on its inner surface and behind. There is a well-marked medullary cavity, partially occupied by cancellated tissue, and with compact walls, which are thick and dense, especially about the middle. The thick part is the seat also of the bend, and this was doubtless the place from which the sequestrum came. Probably the bone yielded by being used before it was solid. The thickening may have followed afterwards from strain. Compare the rickety tibia, No. 6. 38. G. C. 1143. Presented by Professor James Russell. 6. 157.

The specimen was obtained eighteen years after the removal of the sequestrum. The sequestrum, which has consisted of the entire thickness of the shaft, over the greater part of its extent shows the usual characteristics. The new tibia is somewhat bent, but in addition is very irregular. New bone has been thrown out on all sides, but especially over the shin, where there is also a shelf- like projection towards the outer side. The medullary canal has been filled in, if a new one was ever formed. At each end there is a cavity in the cancellous tissue, but these may have been made in preparing the specimen. A large ulcer has probably remained after the sequestrum was removed, and having become chronic, has produced secondary changes upon the newly formed tibia. G. C. 1142.

Mary A., set. 26, Shetlander, had a tubercular appearance and family history.' Six months before coming to Hospital she had "acute rheumatism" (tuberculosis?) which did not affect the joints of the right wrist, although it attacked almost all her other joints. She believed she had twisted this wrist while turning in bed when suffering from the "rheumatism." The wrist and hand gradually became swollen, painful, and unnaturally movable. Fluctuation ensued. Amputation was performed above the wrist. A week later she had severe pain in her head. There was no phthisis, but death occurred shortly afterwards from general tuberculosis. No post-mortem examination was obtained. There are caseous deposits in many of the carpal bones and in the bases of the metacarpals. Some of these centres are surrounded by a vascular area, and in some cases the caseation has spread from one adjacent bone to another. At some places the bones are softened, vascular, and broken down. In many places the cartilage has disappeared, having been chiefly attacked from within. The non-vascular portion of the radial side of the unciform consists of hard dense bone, in the others the non-vascular PC 3072 portion is caseous and soft. Presented by A. G.

The specimen shows a combination of erosion with new bone formation. The erosion is seen partly in the interior, where the cancellous tissue is destroyed, and partly on the surface, near the lower end, where there are pits and irregular excavations.

He had very considerable power in moving the great toe, and in a healthy subject little, or, indeed, no deformity, would have followed the operation." On the inner side of the base there is a deep excavation, the wall of which is formed of rarefied bone. The disease was considered to be syphilitic, but the diagnosis at that time (1828) may not have discriminated between syphilis and tuberculosis. G.

The upper half is very irregular, partly from new bone formation on the surface, especially at the back and on the sides lower down, and partly from erosion and opening out of the bone. The latter change is best seen on the inner tuberosity and at the back of the articular surface. This may have begun as tubercular disease of the head of the tibia which became septic. B. C. i. 5.

The femur is greatly thickened, and its surface is irregular. The lower articular surfaces are eroded and absorbed in front, and posteriorly are covered by irregular deposits of bone. The cancellated tissue above the articular surface is irregularly hollowed out, and what remains has been rarefied. The shaft of the bone is considerably thickened, and near the upper end shows a periosteal crust, like that due to septic inflammation. Below this, however, the new bone is irregularly absorbed and eaten into, as if by tubercular granulations. The articular surface of the tibia is more complete, although in front it shows considerable depression and excavation as if from tuber- culosis.

On the outside the parietal bones near the vertex are roughened, chiefly by the enlargement of the vascular pores. On the frontal bone there is also rough- ening, not only by enlargement of vascular pores, but by numerous small grooves on the surface, probably for blood- vessels. On the inside the roughness is chiefly due to new bone formation round small vascular channels, although the pores for entering vessels are enlarged also. The roughness is most marked on the frontal bone, and especially near the middle line. At two places the surface of the inner table is left exposed, and is surrounded by ragged bony spicules of newly-formed bone. Possibly at these places there have been gummatous deposits between the bone and dura mater. B. C. r. 7. M. 8. 239.

Ihe outside shows remains of its original smoothness at one or two places only, i.e. near the right frontal eminence, at the temporal ridges, and near the anterior and inferior angle of the nght parietal bone. The roughness is due partly to the opening out of vascular channels and partly to shallow depressions of he surface, which are most marked at the back and on the eft sxde of the vertex.

Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.—Skull-cap of an elderly person—macerated, illustrating the above. The changes are best seen at and behind the vertex. The bone is unchanged below the temporal ridges, but elsewhere it is more or less porous. At the back and to the left side of the sagittal suture there are numerous irregular apertures, due apparently to enlargement of vascular channels. At places near the vertex areas of bone are mapped out by pores and erosions, and the surface of the upper part of the occipital bone is similarly roughened. The interior of the skull-cap, especially near places most affected on the outside, shows marks of con- siderable vascularity, but there is practically no bone formation. There are two small bony projections near the front, one on either side of the longitudinal sinus—apparently, by their smoothness, of long standing. The skull-cap is apparently not thickened, but is increased in weight from condensation of the diploe. B. C. i. 7. M. 9. 6. 241. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.—Portion of left parietal bone—macerated, illustrating the above. There is great roughness on the outside, and sclerosis and thickening of the substance. The roughness on the outside is due to erosion, and the opening out and running together of vascular channels. The interior shows somewhat similar changes, only less marked. On the lower portion of the sawn surface the superficial openings are seen to penetrate well into the bone, and at some places to pass quite through it, while the bone on the section at the upper side is almost uniformly white and dense, like ivory.

Changes are present on the frontal, parietal, occipital, superiorSyphilitic ' Caries.' 295 maxillary, and left malar bones. The frontal bone is the most affected. Between the frontal eminences there is a large patch where the surface is roughened and in places eaten away. The roughness is due to the opening out of vascular channels. From this patch extensions pass down to the external angular processes, and some tissue is lost at a corresponding part above each orbit. The rest of the vault of the skull shows changes similar to those seen on the frontal bone, only less marked. The bones of the skull are not thickened but the diploe is con- densed. The left malar and superior maxillary bones are roughened on their facial aspect, partly by new periosteal bone, and partly by the opening out of vascular channels. A slight degree of the same change is seen on the right superior maxillary and malar bones. B. C. i. 7. M. 22. 6. 243. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.—Skull and lower jaw of a negro—macerated, illustrating the above. At the right frontal eminence and below the left one there is considerable loss of the surface from erosion, and possibly from superficial necrosis. On the left side the skull is also perforated. Round these places there are the usual pores due to increased vascularity, which have been opened out into irregular pits here and there. A somewhat similar condition is seen on the lower jaw, below and behind each mental foramen. Some roughness is seen on the malar and superior maxillary bones. In the interior of the skull there are marks of increased vascularity at various places, but especially on the frontal bone. The skull, as a whole, seems thick, and the sutures are distinct. B.

A certain amount of symmetry in the diseased patches is seen on the frontal bone, and on the front of the parietal; but the most advanced patch, which is on the right of the vertex, has no corresponding patch on the left side. At some places the bone is quite smooth, and at others the vascular channels are opened out, sometimes into fine pores, sometimes into pits and erosions, as noticed in previous specimens. On the patch to the right of the vertex these excavations have nearly encircled a piece of bone, which is itself porous. These excavations, or bone ulcers, seem to have been advancing on the right side, while others on the left have been healing over. The interior of the skull over the vault is roughened by enlargement of vascular channels. The diploe is almost entirely filled up by sclerosed bone, and the skull is somewhat increased in weight.

On the corre- ponding part on the left side and in front there are also similar tubercles, but their margins are sharper and the bone round is more porous. The whole of the top of the skull is porous, and at places the apertures are opened out into irregular erosions. There is, in fact, scarcely any part of the external surface of the cranial bones which is not changed by an early or receding stage of the opening-out process. Most of the facial bones show similar changes. On the left eminentia articularis- there is a smooth undermined and partially separated scale of bone, as if a layer of the articular surface had been necrosed.

The surface of this piece is porous and rough, as in other cases of syphilitic necrosis. Below the right temporal ridge the parietal bone has been trephined for reasons unknown. On the inside, below the mark near the right frontal eminence, there is a distinct thickening of bone, with marks of increased vascularity.

Some smoothing over is per- ceptible, even on the necrosed part itself, from which it would appear that the necrosis had resulted from a recrudence of the disease after the subsidence of a former attack. About the level of the frontal eminences a mass of very irregular, apparently necrosed bone is in process of separation. It measures two and a half inches by one and three-quarter inches and lies obliquely across the forehead.

There has been extensive destruction of the frontal and nasal bones. On the outer surface the parts not necrosed are roughened from increased vascularity. Almost the whole of the frontal region is occupied by a roughened seques- trum, which seems to have been detached and only held in place during life by the soft parts, for it is now glued into position. Its surface is roughened by apparently recent and old-standing changes, similar to those already described, and part of the surface seems to have been detached as a superficial necrosis. All round it there is a groove, which, however,' has not penetrated through the inner table, and the margins of which for the most part overhang. The frontal sinuses are exposed, but their mesial septum remains. The bones forming the bridge and sides of the nose are wanting, and the ethmoidal and maxillary sinuses are freely exposed. The vomer is deficient, and.there is a large gap near the front of the hard palate The interior of the roof of the skull is roughened by marks of dilated blood-vessels, but to a less extent than might have been expected from the changes on the outside. Only at one spot- near the middle line in front-has the process of necrosis penetrated into the interior. On the base of the skull the bony ridges are sharp and strongly marked, both inside and outside.

" He was now, I found, using the decoction of sarsaparilla under the direction of Dr Kennedy, which I desired him to continue ; and after consulting with Dr Kennedy we agreed to prescribe the Plummer's Pills, of which he was directed to take three daily along with the decoction. Under this course a rapid amendment took place ; the incrustations- dropped off from his skin ; he recovered his looks and flesh, and in short complained of nothing but an offensive discharge from the nostrils. His- spirits got up, and he seemed to entertain sanguine hopes of recovery. In this state he came over from the Old Town to my house late one evening in the month of July, during the prevalence of a cold easterly wind; he complained of having caught cold, was exceedingly hoarse, and upon inspection the palate and fauces were found considerably inflamed. On enquiry I ascertained that of late he had been repeatedly out at night, and had been living altogether in a very irregular and dissipated manner! I ordered him home instantly, desired him to confine himself entirely to the house, to lay aside the use of the Plummer's Pills, to take a dose of salts, and to go into the warm bath ; which directions, with the exception of the confinement, I have reason to believe he complied with. "Soon after this an ulcer broke out in the palate immediately behind the incisors-the velum palate and tonsils also became ulcerated—the offensive discharge from the nostrils increased—pieces of the inferior spongy bone exfoliated-the teeth dropped from their sockets-and though mercury in every form had for some time been kid aside a. copious salivation now commenced, owing to the irritation from the diseased state of his mouth affecting the salivary ducts and glands He was unable to take almost anything in the shape either of food or medi- cine. Of the latter nothing was recommended to him but bark laudanum, laxations, and an alum gargle. He continued to linger for several weeks, and expired about the beginning of November, greatly emaciated, and exhausted by hectic fever. "On examining the exterior surface of the cranium, a circular portion of the right parietal bone, about the size of a shilling, may be observed flattened and somewhat rough; from this an exfoliation had taken place previous to the patient's coming under my care. On the interior surface of the bone opposite to this spot the impressions of numerous small vessels are to be seen deeply indented into the bone, and giving it a rough scabrous feel. "On the internal aspect of the frontal bone two circular U306 Diseases of Bone. portions are to be seen marked by the impressions of numerous .small vessels similar to what is observed on the parietal bone. " Large portions of the superior maxillary bones, including the alveolar process of the front teeth, are in the process of ■exfoliation. « On examining the base of the skull, the condyloid and cuneiform processes of the occipital bone and the posterior ■clinoid processes of the sphenoidal bone may be observed partially diseased" (Edin.

I could see into the throat, so as to observe the motion of the velum palate, while he was speaking. Some time after the disease was stopped in its progress, the cranium became affected. It did not, strictly speakmg, exfoliate, but the whole substance came away. The pnlsation of the brain forcing the dura mater against the edge of the bone, it was destroyed by nlcera- tion and fungus cerebri followed, when the man died. ' There is an aperture just behind the centre of the coronal suture, extending backwards for two and a half inches. It is widest about half an inch from the front, where it measures two inches across, and becomes narrower towards the back The edges are sharp and jagged, and the margin is bevelled from the outside. The bevelled portion on the front and left side is mostly smoothed over, as if the process had ceased there, but on the right side it is irregular, as if still m process. The greater part of the frontal bone shows numerous vascular markings, producing a mosaic-like pattern, the result apparently of horizontally running blood-vessels. At one or two places there are patches of opened-out vascular pores. Below the right frontal eminence is a patch of necrotic bone irregularly circular in outline, and measuring one and a half307 Syphilitic Necrosis. Incites across. This piece is surrounded by a distinct trench, which below has penetrated through the skull. The sides and back of the calvarium are comparatively unchanged, but the bone is increased in thickness and the diploe is partially filled up. The vomer, nasal, lachrymal, inferior turbinated, and greater part of the ethmoid and nasal portion of superior maxillary bones have entirely disappeared. The ethmoidal sinuses and the antrum of Highmore on each side are completely exposed from the nose. The back of the palate is gone, and only a trace of the nasal septum is seen at the roof. Marks of increased vascularity are seen on the malar bones below each orbit. The back of the skull shows at various places patches of roughness owing to increased vascularity. B. C. r. 7.

In front there is an aperture with rounded margins, as if necrosis had separated and the part healed. Behind that, and separated from it by a bridge of bone, is another aperture, more irregular and with sharper margins, as if a sequestrum had only recently separated from it. On the inside there are marks of increased vascularity, old-standing in front and recent behind. Near the apertures the bone is irregular and eroded in both aspects, but this surrounding irregularity does not correspond on the two aspects. W. C. G. 46. 265.

The largest, which measures four by three and a halt inches at its greatest diameters, shows marks of old-standing and recent irregularity on both sides, but mostly on the inner side. Apparently the inner palate has only been involved in necrosis here and there, for its surface is very irregular. The other pieces, although smaller in size, seem to have more completely involved the whole thickness of the skull. In one, the outer table is comparatively unchanged, while the irregularity is very great on the inner side.

Syphilitic Disease of the Skull after Separation of Sequestrum.—Frontal portion of a calvarium, with scalp—in spirit, illustrating the above. Just below the roots of the hair, to the right of the middle line, there is a small healed ulcer of the skin, with a small fv&e- O ment of necrosed bone on its base. The margins of the ulcer are smooth, and, though somewhat overhanging, seem completely covered with epithelium. On the floor below the necrosed fragment the bone is covered by a thin layer of fibrous-looking material, possibly epithelium. The interior of the bone lias dura mater clinging to it in many places, and where bare shows marks of increased vascularity. The skull itself is thickened and condensed. B.

On the frontal bone, to the right of the middle line, and extending downwards from about one and a half inches below the coronal suture, there is a rough irregular depression. It shows a perforation above, and ends in a deep branching groove below. The margins are bevelled off, and in some places the irregularities are rounded as if there the disease had been healing, while at others they are sharp as if it had been extending. The interior of the bone shows marks of increased vascularity, especially on the frontal bone, which is thickened on the right side; and shows irregular depressions on the left.

Syphilitic Disease of the Skull-Healing- after Extensive Destruction.-Skull of an adult-macerated, illustrating the above. The disease has been most advanced on the frontal bone and on those of the face, round the nose and mouth. On the outside there is considerable roughness and porosity near the external occipital protuberance. The diploe, where exposed, seems for the most part normal. The whole of the lower part of the frontal bone is also roughened and irregular. Above, the irregularities are shallow, and the surface is smoothed over, but below they are deeper and the bone surface is porous. At one spot the frontal sinus has been opened into. The margins of the anterior nares have been attacked, and the bone is porous. The alveolar border shows similar changes, and many of the teeth must have fallen out shortly before death. The hard palate is roughened, and on the left side is perforated by a small aperture. The interior of the skull shows marks of increased vascularity, especially in the frontal region, but this is less marked than might have been expected fromthe condition of the outside.Healing after Syphilitic Necrosis. 311 6. 274.

On the right parietal bone, near the vertex, is a circular depression, one and a half inches in diameter, with a sinuous rounded margin and irregular base, which has been smoothed over. This is as if a superficial sequestrum had been separated some time before, and the part had healed over. In front of the left parietal eminence is a shallow depression, with a base, which is at one place smooth and at others rough, as if the disease have been in process of cure.

Syphilitic Disease of the Skull—healed after Loss of Bone about the Nose and Left Orbit.—Anterior half of a skull—macerated, illustrating the above. The bridge of the nose, nasal septum, and margins of the nasal cavity have been lost, and a single rounded aperture represents the anterior nares. There is a small aperture in the hard palate. The ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses are no longer traceable. Their position is now occupied by roughened bone. The antrum of Highmore on each side is nearly filled in by similar roughened bone, but an opening into the frontal sinuses is still present. The outer wall of the left orbit is for the most part wanting, and the disease here seems to have been in progress at the patient's death, although at other places it must have subsided. The interior of the skull is irregular, apparently from development of bone round the blood-vessels!

The vertebra show an increased vascularity on the bodies and laminae. The ribs are not appreciably altered. The clavicles show enlarged pores for blood-vessels, but nothing that is characteristic. On the scapulae the posterior part of the spines, especially the left, is somewhat thick and irregular, but otherwise there is no appreciable change. The right humerus is considerably thickened at its lower end by periosteal new bone formation, most marked in front. There the surface, besides being irregular, is in places eroded as if the new material were being absorbed again. The periosteal crust diminishes from below upwards, and does not quite reach the deltoid attachment on the outer side, although it can be traced further up on the back. The rest of the bone shows only an enlargement of vascular pores. The left humerus has only a very slight periosteal crust, about the middle of the posterior surface. Elsewhere the surface of the bone is rough from enlargement of the vascular pores. The right ulna shows only some periosteal crusts on the outer side of the upper end, and enlargement of vascular pores at other places, but the left ulna shows a very distinct thickening all round the shaft, about the middle. The changes at the upper end correspond to those on the ri-ht side. The radii show an increased size of vascular apertures and some periosteal new bone formation on the upper part of the outer surface. On the right side, in addition, thereSyphilitic Affections of the Skeleton. 315 is a slight deposit of periosteal bone, just above the front of the lower articular surfaces. The bones of the hand show no definite change. The pelvis shows no characteristic change. On both sides the vascular channels seem unusually well marked, and on the right side, the outer surface of the ilium is slightly roughened by periosteal formation. The right femur is thickened from the lower end up to about the middle, but more behind than in front. The surface of the thickening has all the appearance of new periosteal formation, and is more irregular on the back than in front. One vascular channel on the back is enlarged into a distinct aperture. The shaft of the left femur is thickened about the middle, mostly on the inner side, but also slightly all round. A periosteal crust can be traced downwards to the knee-joint, especially on the inner side. On both tibia? the vascular pores are enlarged, and some new bone has been formed on the shin surface and at the attachment of the tibialis anticus muscle. Both fibulae show slight periosteal rough- ness at the muscular attachments, and an enlargement of vascular pores. The bones of the foot show no appreciable change- G. C. 3391. 6. 283.

About the middle the anterior and upper parts have been attacked, and an excavation has been formed, in the base of which are fragments of necrotic-looking bone partially separated. This excavation is surrounded by new periosteal bone, which passes round to the under surface, and fades off at either side. The outer end of the bone is irregular and partially absorbed, and near it new periosteal bone has been formed. G. C. 993. 6.284.

MacLaren's care, suffering from necrosis of the bones of the forearm, diagnosed to be syphilitic in character. For this condition the iorearm was amputated through the upper third on 19th April 1S87 The wound healed well. Shortly afterwards at the upper part of the tibia a gumma formed, which softened and burst, leaving an ulcer with bare bone at its base. Another similar ulcer soon formed at the lower end of the tibia. For these the patient was again admitted to the Royal Infirmary in June 1887. Both ulcers continued discharging, in spite of treatment, and without any indication of the separation of the necrosis. As the co^nuc d,Sckrge waS weakening the patient, the leg was amputated through the lower third of the thigh by Dr MacLaren on 8th November330 Diseases of Bone. 1S87. Although no history of syphilis, congenital or acquired, could be obtained, the syphilitic nature of the disease was diagnosed from the course of the symptoms, and it was considered to be probably congenital." The whole of the bone is enlarged by the formation of cancellated tissue. At the upper end there is a section of the necrosis, and its white, non-vascular character is brought out in contrast with the surrounding injected bone. Round the surface of the necrosis there Avas an ulcer of the skin, part of which has been left. Part, however, has been removed, to show patches of caseous material, which had been present in the periosteum outside the base of the ulcer. A certain amount of separation of the necrosis had occurred, but not enough to loosen it. Several white caseous deposits are seen in the interior of the bone, above the necrosis, and one or two are seen near the anterior surface at the lower end. On the soft parts, near the lower end, a large gumma is shown, caseous and non-vascular, and surrounded by an area of increased vascularity. In front of this a small sinus in the skin has been left, and the soft parts removed near it, to show that it led down to a gummatous deposit in the periosteum. G. C. 2770. Presented by P. H.

Its surface is rough and porous, as if it had formed the base of an extending ulcer. One or two smaller nodes may be seen above the large one. The bone is unusually light. The grounds for believing this to be a case of syphilis are the presence of the nodes, and of so large an ulcer in so comparatively young a person. (See No. 6. 339.) G. C. 1179.

The upper of these two is the smaller and has a porous surface. The other larger one has its surface partly smooth and partly porous. The outer and posterior surfaces of the bone are rough and irregular. The medullary cavity is occupied by cancellous bone beneath the upper node, and at other places shows irregular dilations. These in old syphilitic bones usually contain fat, not pus or caseous matter, as might possibly be supposed. The tissue of the bone is on the whole lightened, and the compact outer layer has for the most part been replaced by cancellous tissue. J B. C. i. 5. M. 78, 79. 6. 343. Syphilitic (Mercurial?)

"The foot is now enormously swollen, especially in its posterior two-thirds. The anterior part is narrow and contracted, due to the three last toes being turned upwards, their plantar surfaces looking directly outwards and forwards, caused by his resting the foot on the outer border, and the pressure gradually raising the toes upward. There is a largish tumour on the sole, at the base of the great toe, the under surface of which is ulcerated. Characteristic tubercles are formed all over the foot, and even up the leg as far as the upper third. The leg is slightly swollen. There is a good deal of pain, attended with a burning sensation in the affected limb. The tubercles discharge sago-like granules of a black kind. His health is fair." The interior of the bones, as well as the soft parts, are occupied by characteristic black granules of varying size.

It gradually enlarged, and suddenly one day he found a small opening on its upper surface, which, on being squeezed, discharged blood and matter, and reddish grains like granules of soda Soon after, others of the same character appeared all over the dorsal aspect of the sole of the foot. When these button-like tubercles • were enlarging, pain was severe, and as soon as they burst and discharged their contents he obtained relief, which was absent so long as the tubercles were empty ; but as they began to enlarge, the pain also appeared, and gradually increased in severity with the enlargement Never worked in black cotton soil, was never pricked with a thorn, and has not suffered from guinea-worm." The foot, especially towards the front, has been enormously swollen, and the surface, especially of the dorsum, is studded over with rounded tubercles of varying size. The interior of the front of the foot has been converted into a large cavity which contained a clear fluid, and in which the metatarsal bones are lying macerated and loose, their substance being rarefied and more or less absorbed. The soft parts are tunnelled in various directions by channels leading from the interior to the tubercles on the surface, and containing in many places characteristic yellow granules. G- C. 2509.

After the discharge of the granules, the pain, which increases until then, becomes less, and he gets relief until the tubercles are again ready to discharge. " He is anxious to have the foot removed. "Has never been in black cotton soil; has never had guinea worm. Some ten years previous to the appearance of the white patch, he was pricked by a thorn in the sole, near the middle of the bases of the toes. After that he was laid up for a month. Through the opening a slough was discharged, and the granulations were exulcerant, which were ■destroyed by some caustic application. "He was only able to walk three months after the receipt of the injury." In this specimen the front of the foot has been distended even more than in the previous case, and the bones have been more extensively affected. The tubercles on the surface are fewer and smaller.

The circumference of the tumour at the widest part was twenty-eight inches. Its consistence was firm and elastic, except at one or two spots, where it had become cystic. The outline was nodular, and several large veins were seen on the surface. In cutting the tumour calcareous nodules were met with, so that the knife and saw had to be used alternately. The tumour consists of nodules of cartilage varying from the size of a pea to that of a walnut. The smaller nodules, when fresh, were translucent and firm like the substance of the crystalline lens. The large ones were yellowish and some- what opaque, and in some cases had softened at the centre Bound the nodules there was a delicate stroma of connective tissue, carrying blood-vessels. From these, in some places, lime salts have been deposited, so as to form a calcareous shell round ' the nodules. Here and there, where several calcareous nodules have united, the interior is transformed into cancellous bone The outer part of the shaft of the humerus is thickened and sclerosed at the upper end, but the interior is unaffected The tumour seems to have started from the thickened part, and to have partially surrounded the humerus. Microscopically, the tumour was found to consist of hyaline cartilage without special features.

Chondro-sareoma of the Thumb.—Section of a thumb—in spirit—showing a chondro-sarcomatous tumour growing from the first phalanx. The man, aged 51, was admitted to the Koyal Infirmary, Edin- burgh, in December 1891. His family history was good, and he had previously been quite healthy and temperate. "Seven years ago," while holding a horse with a rope, the rope got twisted round his thumb and hurt it. The thumb was sore for several days after this, but did not swell. This was in spring ; during the 'summer it felt stiff, and in the following winter the first phalanx swelled up from what was considered to be rheumatism. During the following winter it again became at times sore and swollen. The swelling was red, and the veins over it were distended. It came and went more frequently, and seemed to be worse on exposure to cold. It soon continued to be painful even when there was no swelling. This intermittent swelling continued for four years, when he noticed a small lump attached to the outer side of the first phalanx. The lump was bluish and soft; it was very painful, and he thought it was going to form matter, 'it, however, continued to grow without coming to a head. Eighteen months ago it was opened, and only blood came out, and last August it was opened again, with the same result. The thumb was amputated and the patient shortly afterwards went home. After section the tumour was found to have originated in the front of the first phalanx, and to have expanded the bone for a short distance laterally, but there was no shell of the bone over the main piece of the tumour. The joints at each end of the phalanx were not affected. The tumour mass was of firm consistence, except towards the margins, where it was soft and reddish, hemorrhages having taken place into the tissue at these parts. The main mass of the tumour presented a gelatinous appearance, with a network of dense white material, apparently cartilage of firmer consistence than the rest, and with calcareous nodules interspersed. Microscopic examination showed it to be chondro-sareoma (round-celled) with some myxomatous degeneration. G. C. 3358. Presented hj John Duncan, F.R.C.S.E., December 1891.344 Diseases of Bone. 6. 366.

Chondro sarcoma of Scapula and Chondromata of Fingers and Humerus.—Eight arm, with scapula and part of clavicle amputated for enormous chondrosarcoma of the scapula—in spirit. The patient was a gentleman, aged 33. From infancy the joints- of both arms were noted as "peculiar." The shoulder, elbow, and finger joints of his right arm were supposed to have heen "put out" by some injury, of which, however, no history was obtainable from his mother. During childhood and boyhood the finger-joints steadily got more "peculiar," enlarging gradually till, when he was 18 years of age, the growths formed a decided inconvenience, particularly those on the right hand, all the fingers of which were affected. On the left hand, the middle, ring, and little fingers only had growths. As the tumour of the right middle finger hindered him from writing, the finger was removed by Professor Syme. The patient was at this time fully engaged in hard office work. In 1870, when about 20 years of age, he went to Southern India, and remained there for thirteen years, enjoying, until the growth of the great tumour, perfect health. He was able to write, ride, and play lawn tennis. The growths on his fingers had meanwhile only slightly increased up to about January 1883 (the year of the operation) He then be-an to feel pain in the right shoulder, and was treated for neuralgia. The nam got worse ; the shoulder began to swell; his clothes required altering, and finally he had to keep his arm in a sling outside of his clothes altogether The pain centred over the bicipital groove and was very much aggravated by the least pressure. _ By April 1883 he had gradually become invalided, the pain getting steadily worse. He walked with difficulty, till in July he was forced to lie up. After a month in hed he could only stand with help. In August he was carried to Madras for further advice. At this time lie could straighten his legs, but the growth was increasing rapidly At Madras he was advised to return home, and did so, being earned into Ins bunk in October, and never leaving it during a voyage of thirty days. Being a tall man, his legs were kept permanently bent up, ^J^Zl the position described in " present condition." On arriving m Edin laugh he saw Dr Gillespie. Dr Patrick Heron Watson was shortly afterwards called in consultation, but thought that any operation was madvis- able, because the patient's general health was m such an unsatisfactory condition.345 Sarcoviatous Cartilaginous Tumours. By 17th December his general condition and blood had consider- ably improved under treatment, and Dr Watson decided to remove the arm, scapula, outer third of the clavicle along with the tumour, as the only possible means of affording relief to the patient's intense sufferings. He was in a state of constant acute suffering, and could not retain the arm for five minutes in one position. The pain prevented the possibility of sleep for more than three minutes at a time, and he had not slept an hour for many weeks. He had quite a cachetic appearance. At this time the tumour of the right scapula rose as a great hump above the line of his shoulder. It was incorporated with the scapula and adjacent parts. It was firm in consistence in some places, and soft and almost fluctuating in others. There were also multiple growths, like small apples and firm in consistence, on the metacarpal and phalangeal bones of both hands. The knees were rigidly semi-flexed, and the patient had scarcely any power over his lower limbs, the muscles of which were much atro- phied. The thighs and calves felt brawny. Dr Watson operated on 17th December 1883, and the wound healed without a bad symptom. Although he made a capital recovery as to wound, he only slowly recovered the use of his legs, by the use of rubbing, the "battery'' and extension at night to straighten the knees. On 6th April 1884 his general health was good, but as he was still unable to use his legs, much the same treatment was continued. On 20th June 1884 a photograph of the cicatrix was taken. He could then walk with help and his health was good. During July and August he walked fairly well and went to the country. In September, on his return, he did not look so well his colour being dusky. In November 1884 Dr Bum Murdoch was called to attend him for pains in his chest on the right side, with short- ness of breath and cough. Some pleuritic rubbing was heard, and a copious effusion into both right and left pleural cavities was detected He died shortly afterwards, in November 1884, from obstruction to respira- tion ana increasing weakness. ^^.-The chest (both sides) was full of fluid, and both lungs were studded over with hard and semi-hard nodular masses. One or two nodules of a similar nature were found on the internal surface of the ribs. (Permission had been given to examine the chest only.) The fingers are disfigured by numerous simple cartilaginous tumours of the usual character. A section of one has been made to show its structure. The firm lobulated cartilaginous substance mterspersed with calcareous and osseous nodules, is characteristic of the slow-growing simple chondroma. A somewhat similar tumour can be seen growing from the outer condyle of the humerus, as well as from the adjacent portions of the bone The tumour on the scapula has been sliced in one or two places346 Diseases of Bone. to show its character. It is formed of large masses, surrounded by fibrous tissue. The interior of these masses is broken up into small portions, apparently by the softening of the matrix, so that the tumour has an irregular, honeycombed appearance, which is a great contrast to the firm texture of the chondroma of the fingers, placed in juxtaposition to it. Microscopically this tumour consists of a substance resembling embryonic cartilage, showing numerous spindle cells, with a relatively small proportion of inter-cellular substance. G. C. 2726.

John Bell called it an " osteo-sarcoma arising from the humerus."Sarcomatous Cartilaginous Tumours. 347 The following history of the case is taken from John Bell's "Principles of Surgery," vol. iii. part i. page 82 :— "Alexander Macdonald, a Highlander, from Fort Augustus—a tall and handsome lad, passing six feet in height, and uncommonly athletic— was put to the Perth Academy for his education in writing, book-keeping, and such other parts of learning as might qualify him for a counting- house. It was intended to send him to America, a clerk to the North- West Company, in the fur trade. In running violently at tennis, in the ' Academy green, he fell and hurt his shoulder. It was such a bruise as often happens from a fall, without<entailing the slightest ill consequence beyond the first pain and swelling ; the skin was blackened by the bruise and the joint was sprained ; he had excessive pains along the Whole arm for twenty-four hours ; but it vanished gradually. He imagined himself well; he had recovered everything but the strength of his arm ; but after the violence of the pain (which lasted no more than twenty-four hours) was gone, such weakness remained, that though from his great strength he could lift perpendicularly such weights as others could not move, vet he could never raise his arm to his head. "I was at pains to question his father, a respectable old man concerning the part which received the injury, and he clearly and decidedly affirmed that it was not the shoulder-joint, but the middle of the bone of the arm that received the shock. It was along the whole of the arm that he felt the pain, and could distinguish the marks of the bruise ?aln had> after its violence, totally ceased, as if the part had sustained no permanent injury, and he believed himself well It was exactly at the end of a month that the pain returned and fixed in the jomt,_ with a very distressing sense of weakness, so that he could not at all raise his arm ; if he meant to put on his hat with it, he had to raise it with the other hand, and when thus raised, if he lowered it a»ain without support, the moment it fell unsupported below the levef it descended like lead. Still, he could lift perpendicularly a very great we,ght but from this second period of pain we must date the disease. The wholearm swelled, but especially about the shoulder. His cries and shrieks were wild and melancholy. Living in a remote part of the High- lands, it is natural for the father to express himself in the following words which he invariably uses when I question him in regard to the degree of pain : Sir, there was no hour of the night nor day in which you could not hear his wild cries miles off.' He represented the particular pain by saying it seemed as if he had been bored with hot irons ; and his cries were so unceasing, as well as so piercing, that ' though they lived in a very long house they had no sleep from this time forward.' That sucn had been his condition no one could doubt who saw him ™ZL i?flY?r SWdling kept e1Ual Tace with these dreadful '< rad X « i , 6 Seemed dlMy t0 Swe11 from the Moulder-joint; gradually the whole arm swelled, and the forearm and hand dwindled. re t V lStlStl'0ng) WaS WaSt°d With the aS™y and wa*t of before it ^ t \ ^ **** tllG al'm WaS "o^rously swelled, and before it was entity oppressed, or the forearm wasted, he couldDiseases of Bone. lift as heavy a weight with the left arm as with the right, and even to the last stage, that in which I saw him, his hand was strong to grasp. In the first four months the upper part of the arm had so increased in size that the prominent part exceeded the size of his head, hut now, at the end of nine months, it greatly exceeds in size Ins emaciated body. '< When I went to receive this poor lad, I found him lying deep m the hold of a small sloop, in which he had been transported from Inverness, laid on a coarse mattress, and bolstered up against the shelving side of the vessel • and when the clothes were lifted I solemnly declare that I hardly knew It first what it was that I saw—which was the tumour and which his body or how to connect in imagination the one with the other. He lay in an inclined and irregular posture, extremely languid, and hardly able to articulate, his head inclining to one side. The tumour, when first exposed by lifting the clothes, might be mistaken for his body in respect of size it was of a suitable bulk, and when the lean, yellow, emaciated thorax was next exposed, the tumour seemed so much to exceed it in size, with a shining surface and brilliant colour, that at first I was more confounded than shocked, so impossible was it, in the first moments, to consider of it as a tumour, or to see its relation to the arm. The forearm was dwindled and shrunk, and projected from the tumour at a strange and unnatural distance from the shoulder. The veins were swelled, like these of a horse's belly ; large fungous tumours, as big as oranges, projected m a -roup from the outside of the arm at the place where, about two months before, a large abscess had burst; and such was the fcetor of the matter running from under these fungi and the languor of this poor emaciated creature, that I had no thought for the present but how to get him conveyed alive to town. After a few days, when he was somewhat recovered from the fatigues of the voyage, I proceeded to write down the history, and examine the actual state of this tumour. I found it through- out solid, consisting chiefly of bone, little cartilaginous, hardly m any part elaskc or yielding, and discharging matter, not from any superficia abscess but apparently from the centre of this enormous mass. I had every reason to believe that the bone and the joint, which certamly were neither broken nor dislocated, had been generally injured, not merely by the shock but by the bruise ; that the parts nearest the bone, and connected with it by the periosteum, had been bruised and inflamed ; that the extreme pain for the first twenty-four hours indicated only the llence oTth'e immediate injury, but the slow vascular action which Tcceeded at the distance of a month proved how deeply the circulation of the bone -as affected, and caused that osseous secretion which generated Ms prodigious shell of bone, while the shaft of the shoulder-bone, from he periosteum of which this callus had been secreted was in part destioyed by an ulcerating process within. That the ulceration, deep] Jeat d not oynly in the bone but in the joint, occasioned those excruciat- Z ortures which were announced by wild and desperate cries night and day U L matter, bursting at last through every obstacle, had made it,Sarcomatous Cartilaginous Tumours. 349 way through that ulcerated part of the surface which is studded with the fungous excrescences represented in the drawing. "This bursting out of the matter brought relief from the pain, and he now lay in a state of extreme languor, moaning and slumbering. You found it painful even to question him, he was so feeble ; he fell, after a few broken answers, into a slumber of mere debility, and closed'his eyes as exhausted ; and while I took the sketch of his posture, and of the proportions of this prodigious tumour, he slumbered continually. His extreme weakness precluded every practical experiment, and left for our discussion the speculative question only: 'In a case so deplorable and hopeless, what should we have done at an earlier stage, when the patient's strength was more entire, and youth and vigour (for he was but 21 years of age) on his side ?' "Here, for the first time, I felt that a bony tumour might, by advancing to the trunk of the body, preclude amputation as entirely as aneunsni of the subclavian artery !

"The cells of this bony tumour were everywhere filled with a matter resembling thick cheese ; the tumour itself, from its great size, and the entire appearance of the os humeri, seemed only to be attached to that bone ; but upon a more minute examination was plainly a produc- tion from its substance. The shoulder-bone could be traced through the whole tumour ; but enlarged, spongy, and ulcerated. The upper part of the scapula, the acromion process, and the outer end of the clavicle could during life, be plainly distinguished to be enlarged, and to form part of the tumour ; and upon dissection, all the bones forming the shoulder- ioint were found to be deeply diseased. The upper and most bulky part of the tumour seemed to proceed as much from these as from the os humeri, and the joint was completely anchylosed." This portion of the tumour is evidently cartilaginous. The nodules in most places are distinct, but over extensive areas they have been softened and broken down. Calcareous deposits are scattered throughout the substance. John Bell's description of the tumour does not correspond exactly to that of a cartilaginous tumour, when he speaks of matter « resembling thick cheese," unless he means << of the consistence of thick cheese." The reference, however, in the Catalogue description of this specimen to the above case could be to no other than that quoted.

From the margin of the obdurator membrane a sharp spicule of bone, one and a half inches in length, points directly to the insertion of the obturator externus muscle, and has evidently developed the ossification of some of its fibres. Below it, attached to the ascending ramus of the ischium, is a large irregular mass of bone which must have occupied the position of part of the obturator externus and adductor magnus muscles. The outer side of the tuber ischii is nodular. The spine of the ischium is irregular and jagged. The remaining portions of the ischium and as much of the ilium as is present are rough on the surface. On the back of the upper end of the femur there is a mass of rough spongy bone corresponding to the position of the quad- ratus femoris muscle; and below the small trochanter an irregular mass of similarly spongy bone arises from the inner surface of the shaft, and occupies a space from above downwards of about four inches, representing, apparently, ossification in the vastus internus and adjacent adductor muscles. This mass of bone is perforated by large sinuses, apparently the position of blood-352 Diseases of Bone. vessels. It may be noted that the position of the tendinous attachments about the great trochanter shows little or no tendency to ossification, and, while the new masses of bone seem to have run into the substance of some of the muscles, other muscles in the neighbourhood—for instance, the iliacus— seem to have escaped entirely. The whole bone is very heavy. G. C. 3414. Presented by T. M. Burn Murdoch, M.D. 6. 374.

Distortion of Bones by Multiple Exostosis.—Femur, tibia, and fibula of a right leg; with part of femur, tibia, and fibula of the opposite side—macerated, illustrating the above. The articular ends of the shafts are greatly distorted by exostoses, and the bones of the legs are fused. On the right side the femur has large irregular exostoses projecting all round the neck, especially behind and below, where they have obliterated the small trochanter. The great trochanter is not much changed, but below it a large irregular mass of bone projects outwards, and while gradually tailing off into thelineaaspera below, runs into the mass at the lesser trochanter in front. These masses of bone are composed of cancellated tissue, with more or less enlarged spaces. The articular surface of the head is rough and nodular below the impression for the ligamentum teres, and the hip-joint has ap- parently been anchylosed. The lower end shows numerous projecting spines and ridges, which are largest on the outside They do not follow the direction of any muscular fibres, and the tip in most cases is exposed, probably from having been covered with cartilage in the recent state. The tibia show, at he inner and posterior parts of the head numerous knobby and spinous projections similar to those on the lower end of the femur A bridge of bone unites the tibia with the fibula about an inch below the level of the tubercle. The lower end of the tibia shows several projecting spines and knobs, and is fused with the lower end of the fibula. The shaft of the tibia show, scarcely any change. There is no ossification in the interosseous membrane, except one small spine on the tibia. The fibula is wanting at its upper end, where it should have articulated with the tibia, but below that place it is fused with it. Except at one or two spots at either extremity, where there are spinous projections, the shaft of the fibula is normal. _ On the left side the lower end of the femur has irregular spinous projections similar to those on the right side The tibia and fibula are affected similarly, but more extensively than those of the right side. The upper end of the tibia is354 Diseases of Bone. bent towards the fibula, and is fused with it at a place corre- sponding to the fusion on the right side. The connecting bridge ■of bone is thrown out into numerous large irregular processes, the tips of which are deficient, as if they had been covered by •cartilage when recent. At one spot, on the outer side, what seems to be the remains of an articulation between the tibia and fibula is perceptible. The rest of the upper end of the tibia is little altered, except at the posterior and inner sides, where the same spinous processes are seen. The lower ends ■of both bones are fused into one common mass, and the bone seems to have been broadened out. A few spinous projections are seen at the lower end of both bones. As on the other side, ossification has not occurred in the interosseous membrane. (For an account of this condition, see "Arch, fur Kim. Chir.," Band 41, p. 420.) B. C. i. 6. M. 20 to 23. 6. 378.

Another irregular piece projects inwards about three inches below the head, and several smaller projections are seen on the back of the bone just below the surgical neck. The deltoid impression is also somewhat prominent. The head of the bone and the tuberosities are small and ill-formed, and the muscular impressions are comparatively faint. The articular surface has lost its smoothness. This appearance of the head and tuber- osities makes it probable that the shoulder-joint had been disused for many years. The lower end of the bone seems normal. This bone may have belonged to the same patient as the previous scapula, but there is no history to that effect. B, C. 1. 6. M. 17. 6. 382.

The shaft of the radius is flattened laterally and curved forwards, and its'lower end is fused with the expanded part of the ulna. The lower articular surface of the radius looks obliquely backwards and inwards. At the upper end of both bones the bony ridges are exaggerated, and the insertions of the brachial anticus and biceps are unusually prominent.

Ivory Exostosis of Nasal Cavity.—Section of an irregular mass of exceedingly dense bone, from the right nasal cavity of a man aged about 40. For many years the patient had suffered from inconvenience and discharge from his right nostril. Some polypi had been removed, and about a year before this mass was taken away it had been recognised as. probably a rinolith. After one or two unsuccessful attempts to remove it while the patient was under chloroform, this mass was finally extracted, but not until the anterior nares had been freely exposed, and their margms enlarged with gouge forceps. During this operation an attempt was- made to divide this mass, and the marks of the saw are shown m the specimen. Had the saw-cut been completed, the removal would have been easier. , The patient died of septic meningitis about a week after tile- operation, and at the post-mortem examination it was found that the mass- had pressed through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and had entered the cranial cavity. On this account the operation had the more easily set up the fatal meningitis. The section shows the dense ivory-like character of the growth. On microscopic examination it was found to be com- posed of very dense bone. It had no doubt originally grown from the ethmoid, but it must have afterwards necrosed, for it was quite loose within its cavity at the time of the operation. G- C. 3273. Presented by A. G.

The patient has never and only had difficulty in walking for the first time two months befoie359 Fibro-Osscous Tumour. admission. About that time one lump appeared in the popliteal space, and another over the inner tuberosity of the tibia. These two have grown rapidly, but painlessly, the one over the femur the more slowly. On admission the patient had no pain in the swellings, and could walk with the aid of a stick. She had some numbness and pain in the toes an foot, and the leg was rather cold. The right knee measured twenty- three inches in circumference at the popliteal space. There were thre special swellings—the largest and uppermost, surrounding the lower third of the femur, seemed to grow from the epiphyseal line. The middle one filled up the popliteal space, and the lowest was on the anterior and inner aspect of the leg. These swellings were smooth and rounded ; the skin was drawn tightly round them, but not involved. After removal by amputation, on 15th October, the tumour was sawn up, and found to be capsulated, smooth, and lobulated. The lower tumour had a watered silk appear- ance, like the section of a fibrous tumour. Two separate nodules of tumour substance were found in the gastrocnemius, and both contained bone. The main mass was found fused with the femur, aud was fibrous externally and osseous inter- nally. The popliteal portion was cartilaginous, and showed a transition between fibrous tissue and cartilage. The tumour was considered an « osteo-chondro-fibroma," as it was composed chiefly of bone, fibrous tissue, and a little cartilage. The specimen on one side has been stained with logwood, which shows the difference between the osseous and the fibrous parts. The cancellated tissue at the lower end of the femur is replaced by condensed bone, like that in the substance of the femur, but the outline of the shaft is still at places perceptible. Some of the new bone forming the tumour is extremely hard and dense. q q 337-3 Presented by Professor John Cuiene. 394.

This upper growth is beyond the tumour, and is almost certainly due to the irritation of its presence. It closely resembles the growth due to pus-forming organisms, and may be considered as " irritative." It may be seen near most specimens of periosteal sarcoma.

Amputation below the trochanterOsteo-Sarcomata. 365 was performed by Dr John Duncan, nearly a year after the symptoms first began. The patient made an excellent recovery, and had returned to business, when the disease appeared in the brain, and, after a few weeks' illness, carried him off. The section shows the tumour to be growing round the outside of the bone, which is, however, also partly affected in the interior. The substance of the tumour is vascular, soft, and friable, with a few bony spicules. Under the microscope it is a large spindle-celled sarcoma. G. C. 3463.

Osteo-Sarcoma of Leg and Foot.—Section of the lower part of a right leg and foot—in spirit, illustrating the above. "1828.—Mr B., aged 57, healthy and active, formerly of habits unmarked by any peculiarity, about eight years ago, while travelling by night on the outside of a stage-coach, had his legs and feet extremely benumbed with cold, and in a few days they were affected with severe pain 1 be left leg soon grew permanently well; the right leg never did. The pain was seated m the shin-bone, varying according to the season and state of the weather. About two years since, the anterior angle of the tibia had become serrated (sic); in a few months afterwards a swelling of the perios- teum appeared on the middle of the bone. This was reduced by a blister and issue. In February 1827 the lower two-thirds of the bone were become enlarged. Numerous processes from the anterior and posterior angles distended the neighbouring muscles ; much thickening of the soft parts round the lower end of the bone, and oedema of the foot. At the end of three months, during which the treatment consisted of repeated applications of leeches and blisters, mercurial alteratives, sarsaparilla and regulated diet, there was a considerable diminution of the pain and of the swelling of the soft parts, but little or no reduction of the size of the366 Diseases of Bone. bone Amputation was now advised, bat Mr B. was induced to place himself in the hands of a quack, who applied stimulating plasters to the lee with a view, he said, of bringing on suppuration, and salivated Mr B with mercury. At the end of three months this person was dismissed, and the former medical attendant again requested to see the patient. A great change had taken place-emaciation, pale complexion, bad appetite, constipation of the bowels, a quick, weak, and irregular pulse ; the leg areatly increased in bulk and deformity, hard all over, and exquisitely painful Its surface was irregular in consequence of several large tubercles, round, firm, and elastic, and somewhat yielding to pressure.. The colour of the leg is livid and dark purple, and the tubercles of a dusky yellow, some of them superficially excoriated. The tibia, up^ to its tubercle is swelled. The knee and thigh are apparently sound, but the inguinal glands are enlarged and indurated, though not painful. ° In a consultation with Professor Russell and Dr Thomson, amputa- tion was again judged proper. This was performed, above the knee, on the 4th September last (1827). The le«r was injected with minute-size injection, and a vertical section made. The tibia nearly in its whole length appeared enlarged and degenerated into a texture more like the carcinomatous than any other The tibia at its middle seemed a little bent, as if it had yielded to the weight of the body. All the soft parts, with slight exceptions, had the same marked appearance as the tibia. ^^.i The stump healed in good time. The swelling of the inguinal .lands entirely subsided, and the patient, with occasional slight attacks of Ldisposition, recovered his former health and vigour, ff^™^ of the pulse remains, which, previous to the removal of the limb was conjectured to depend on a thickened state of the card.c valve, and was considered as no objection to the operation. _ _ The tumour, which is blanched by the spirit, has sur- rounded the tibia, and in its growth outwards has apparently partly infiltrated the muscles, partly pushed them and the tendons before it. 6.412.

The patient was a man, aged 68. The swelling appeared at the back of the arm one year before the operation, and was taken at first for an enlargement of the bursa over the olecranon. The rapid growth, however,°soon made its nature apparent, and the arm was amputated. The tumour was soft, with small calcareous and osseous deposits scattered throughout it, especially at the margins. It has invaded the bone, and seems to have pushed the muscles and fascia aside rather than infiltrated them. G. C. 2837. Presented by Joseph Bell, F.R.C.S.E.

"John Wright, aged 13, was admitted into the Royal Infirmary under Dr Handyside on 13th June 1843, with an extensive tumour of the left thigh-bone. '< Six years since he had an attack of scarlatina, on recovering from which the left thigh remained weaker than the other, and appeared also to be smaller in size. For this the part had been rubbed frequently with various ointments. He continued to go about, otherwise quite well till about six months ago, when, during the night, he was suddenly seized with violent pain in the thigh. Poultices were next applied to the affected part, and afterwards sinapisms and a few leeches ; but under the treatment the thigh increased rapidly in size. Since then the tumour has gradually increased, and of late he has experienced considerable uneasiness from the frequent pain in it, and the deprivation of sleep thus occasioned. «On examination, the thigh was found to be much enlarged especially at its middle, whence it tapered gradually towards each T \nitv The tumour was hard and inelastic, connected evidently S th^os femori Id it occupied about the three middle fifths of that In t av nl its extremities of nearly the normal size.

"The lymphatic glands of the groin and of the rest of the body were carefully examined, and found not to be enlarged or otherwise affected. The motions of the hip-joint were perfect, and were performed without giving rise to pain. The limb below the knee was much emaciated. The countenance of the patient was sallow, and had an emaciated appearance, and his tongue was of a bright red colour. His body generally was not much emaciated, and his health appeared on the whole to be good." (The London and Edinburgh Monthly Journal of Medical Science. -Report of Case by John Struthers, Esq., House Surgeon, Royal Infirmary, vol. v., 1845.) On 13th June the thigh was amputated at the hip-joint by Dr Handyside by the transfixion method, and the patient made a «0od. recovery ; and six weeks after the operation, i.e. 5th August, he left the Royal Infirmary, with the ligatures still discharging, but the stump other- wise doing well. Soon afterwards he complained of occasional frontal headache fol- owed by pain in the left orbit and eyeball, with increased sensibility to light and lachrymation. About the middle of August a small chronic- abscess formed over the occiput. These pains subsided for a time, but by the end of September had returned with such severity as to confine him to the house By the end of October Dr Handyside drew up the following repor :-« The left eyeball was very prominent and discoloured ; almost complete loss of vision. The eyelids were so much tumefied as almost to conceal he eyeba Is, and the veins of the eyelids were very conspicuous being enlarged and tortuous.

The latter however was finally decided upon, and on the 10th of September amputation was performed at the hip-joint. Two days afterwards he died. The disease seems to have begun in the periosteum, just above the epiphyseal line, and to have spread in all directions, i.e., along the surface of the bone and into the medulla, into the soft textures of the joint, and outwards into the thigh. The disease has extended higher under the periosteum than it has in the medulla. The specimen was injected first with carmine and gelatine, and afterwards with tallow and vermilion, and the latter injection mass can be seen in numerous medium-sized arteries at the margin of the tumour, and also in many places within its substance. q q 2g07 Presented by James Hodsdon, F.E.C.S.E. 6. 422.

The following account is taken from Sir Charles Bell's "Surgical Observations of Cases in the Middlesex Hospital," etc., 1816, p. 390 :- "French Ward (Middlesex Hospital). James Lewsley, aged 17.— I observed this young man in the waiting-room, as an Out-patient. He said his friends alarmed him by saying that he was going to have a white swelling in his knee. I found a disease, not in his knee, but in the head of the tibia, a tumour which to the eye appeared like a swelling over the bone; but which, on examining it more particularly was obviously attended with an enlargement of the bone. Three months before this he bad experienced a slight pain on the inside of the knee and head of the tibia and it has continued till the present. ' " From the moment I saw this patient I felt anxiety for him and pointed out to the pupils that this was a tumour forming within the bone and not a scrofulous enlargement, and desired that they^should ,z ch it as in all probability it would prove another example of the fungus hffimat°?F0; some weeks this patient was treated as for inflammation of a bone by repeated application of leeches and blisters on alternate sides of the head f the bones; for presently it appeared that the heads of both he tibia and fibula were affected.

He is very sick and cannot retain anything on his ■stomach, and his countenance is sunk. " Observations at evening lecture.—You have seen that I examined this patient very particularly to-day, and indeed his situation is very interesting; you may have seen that the stump looks well, the ligatures long since removed, and the wound contracted. There does not seem, therefore, any source of irritation in the stump. Whence then arises his present condition ? He daily wastes away, and is very thin : he has shivermgs followed with flushes ; his tongue is white, and he is covered with perspiration, and there is a slight yellow tinge on his skin. Such an attack will sometimes precede the opening and disorder of a stump about the ninth day after the operation ; or the patients in Hospital will be affected by the crowded state of the house. I wish I could so consider the present attack, but I fear it is from another cause-from the irritation of internal disease." These symptoms increased, with the addition of pains in the right side and heaviness in the stomach. The patient gradually sank and died on the 24th. "Post-mortem.-^ right side of the liver was much enlarged, and the surface was like variegated marble. There were spots of a bright yellow colour, from the size of a pin's head to that of the point of the linger. These spots were in clusters, and such parts of the liver felt soft and around these spots there was a vascular structure, deeply stained with blood Similar spots of disease were seen on the lungs, and some of these ^ere of a vascular, soft texture, having the peculiar substance of the soft cancer intervening." Although the tumour is stated to have begun within, it seems more probably to have begun in the periosteum, 'in contrast to the healthy texture of the lower end of the femur, the tibia has a condensed appearance, from its cancelli bein* filled with tumour substance. This has been observed in almost all the preceding periosteal tumours, and is quite different from the destructive changes produced by a central tumour growing at an equal rate with this one. The surface of the tibia has been attacked by the tumour. Without maceration, it cannot be said what amount of new bone, if any has been formed; but even if there were little or none, this would still be in keeping with a periosteal tumour which had crown very rapidly. £• C 1. 6 M. 25.Diseases of Bone. 374 *6. 425.

She, though never very strong, had always had fair health until eight years ago, when she fell and hurt her left knee. It was sprained, according to her doctor, and was "put in" by a bone-setter, after which she could walk. The knee remained swollen, but was not painful. She used a crutch till three years ago. In July 1888 "rheumatism" and swelling all round the knee-joint set in, and this has gradually increased, until it has reached its present size. It is not painful. The tumour, which is in the neighbourhood of the knee, measures twenty-four inches and a half in circumference, and fifteen inches in length. The patient can walk, but the knee is somewhat flexed. The leg was amputated by a postero-internal flap, and the patient did well, except for occasional attacks of gastritis, to which she was. previously subject. She was discharged cured on 14th January 1889. The tumour is composed partly of bone, partly of fibrous tissue, and partly of a soft substance, which has been breaking ' down. The bony part, consisting of both cancellous and compact tissue, forms walls and septa for the softer portions. The soft tumour substance has apparently grown through the lower end of the femur, and stretched the soft parts beyond it. Part of the cartilaginous surface of the condyle still remains apparently normal. The soft substance is composed of round and spindle ceUs, with numerous giant cells. This slow-growing central tumour of the lower end of the femur may be compared with the similarly slow-growing peri- osteal tumour of the same part (No. 6. 393). & C. 2838. Presented by Professor T.

In most parts the marginal bone lias been reduced to a mere shell. Below and near the outer tuberosity the tumour substance is invading the healthy-looking bone, but with very little infiltration. When fresh, the tumour had the characteristic appearance of a myeloid sarcoma. At one spot, i.e. below the crucial liga- ments, there was some greyish sarcomatous-looking substance, but all the rest was like blood-clot, crimson, orange, and yellow in colour, as if in varying stages of decolorisation. These appearances are now much altered by the action of the spirit. The blow had evidently broken the fibula, and seems to have splintered the tibia.

Mrs T aged 62, was admitted to Chalmers Hospital in October 1890 She had been healthy until the present tumour began, about ten years before. The first symptom was pain over the head of the right fibula This was followed by swelling in the neighbourhood winch increased gradually at first, but rapidly for the last twelve months. On admission the tumour surrounded the leg completely m its upper two- thirds. Tbe maximum circumference of the tumour was twenty-two inches. The skin over it was tense, and the veins were dilated. To the touch it felt mostly firm and fibrous; it was fluctuating and apparently cystic in places, with a few calcareous masses perceptible in the walls of the cysts. Amputation was performed through the lower third of the thigh in October 1890, and the patient made a good recovery.377 Central Sarcomata. The tumour, when fresh, appeared to the naked eye to be a sarcoma infiltrating the muscles and tissues of the leg, with large areas of degeneration and blood extravasation. Micro- scopically, it was found to be a "fibro-sarcoma." The greater part of the interior of the tumour was so soft and diffluent that it was washed out from what is now seen as an empty space. The upper end of the fibula is completely destroyed, but there are some plates of bone still remaining in the wall of the tumour. The tumour has, therefore, evidently burst through the fibula, after having partially expanded it. The muscles are stretched over the tumour, and partly involved in ifc- G. C. 3233. Presented by P.

SaPCOma Of Rib.—Portions of the fifth, sixth, and seventh right ribs, with a small portion of lung and liver—in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient, aged 44, was a strong and healthy man, though rather addicted to alcohol. There had been no injury^ so far as was known, and no instance of malignant disease in the family history. The tumour grew first on the sixth rib, and when first noticed was about the size of a small bean. He consulted Dr Craig, who became suspicious of malignancy, from the fact of the man's losing flesh rapidly, without any other apparent cause. In six months after Dr Craig was first called, the man died. At t\z post-mortem examination, the tumour was found to be about the size of a small orange, and projected not quite so far into the pleural cavity as outwards. It was not adherent to the pleura. Secondary deposits occurred throughout the liver, and the lungs also showed traces of being affected. (See the ' 'Edinburgh Medical Journal," February 1885, p. 735.) The muscles lying over the primary tumour have been partly pushed aside, and there is an appearance of a capsule. This, it should be noted, is often misleading, and should not in practice be allowed to contra-indicate malignancy. G. C. 2716. Presented by W. Craig, F.R.C.S.E. 6 441.

It, however, passed out of his hands into those of a female bone-setter, who did not improve matters by her attempt to set the so- called dislocation. The patient then returned to his first attendant, who sent him to the Infirmary, to be under Dr Joseph Bell's care. It was at once evident that nothing short of amputation of the arm, scapula, and greater part of the clavicle, would be of the slightest use. The tumour involved both supra- and sub-scapular regions, and pressed on the axilla. It was also adherent to the skin of the back. The operation was performed, and the boy made a good recovery from it, but died some months after from a return of the disease. The tumour, which seems to have grown from the scapula near the neck, has spread in all directions, and has infiltrated the adjacent muscles. q q 9^9g Presented by Joseph Bell, F.E.C.S.E., P.R.C.S. 442.

The patient, aged 22, a butcher, tall (six feet), and thin, and seems to have rather overgrown himself. Still, he has been always healthy enough, though rather subject to colds. His family history is good. In this end of February 1891 patient had "sciatica-like" pains m the left thigh, chiefly in the knee, and occasionally running up to the thigh He rubbed in a strong embrocation, and poulticed the painful places at times. On the 6th July the pain became much worse, and Dr. M was summoned. He gave him some medicine internally, and a lini- ment for the leg, which eased the pain during severe attacks. The pain was intermittent, worse at nights, and at times very severe. It prevented him from attending to his work. On 13th July he had improved and went back to work. The leg felt stiff, and he limped a little, but the pain was gone as long as the leg was kept quiet. But a slight jerk would cause intense pain, running down the front and inner side of the thigh On the 13th and 14th July he continued at his work, which required him to be on his feet for nearly the whole day. On the 1hjh. went to work, but the pain came on in the thigh so severe y that he had to go home. Dr. M. ordered rest, and he has remained m bed ever since, rarely sitting up for an hour or two at a time. The pain continued pretty "^"on 16th July a little lump appeared on the side of the thigh about . 3 inches below the great trochanter. This soon disappeared vnth rubbing. But at this time the pain was severe up and down he thigh and leg, sometimes into the foot, but always most severe at the knee.Central Sarcomata. 383 On the 29th July (at 11.30 a.m.) patient was lying on his back in bed, with his left leg drawn up. He was in the act of turning on his side, when he felt the thigh give a great crack in its upper third. The pain was intense, causing him to 1' roar out " at the time, and it remained severe for some time afterwards. On the morning before the crack, the patient had noticed a slight diffuse swelling of the thigh. After the crack the swelling quickly increased, till in three' days it had reached its full size. At this time several injections of morphia were given, and the thigh was rubbed well with a liniment. The pain gradually decreased, and on 13th August he was free from pain, except when he gave the leg a jerk. On the 18th and 19th August he had slight sciatica pains in his foot. On 21st August au exploratory incision was made, and the previous diagnosis of sarcoma of bone was confirmed. On 25th August Mr Cathcart amputated at the hip-joint. The patient bore chloroform badly, and had to be stimulated several times with ether. Comparatively little blood was lost, and the patient did fairly well until 7.30 p.m., when he began to collapse, and died at 11 p.m. The section shows that the tumour must have hegun in the centre, just below the level of the great trochanter, where the bone is destroyed. It has extended down the medulla, and upwards into the cancellous tissue, but its chief growth has been outside the bone, entirely surrounding it, and infiltrating the adjacent muscles, although at places there is an appearance of a capsule. The upper fracture must have been the spon- taneous one recorded in the history. The lower fracture was accidentally produced in sawing the specimen, but the bone was greatly weakened there by the disease. The substance of the tumour, when fresh, had a consistence and appearance like the white substance of the brain, except that at certain places it was more vascular. Microscopically, this is a large round-celled sarcoma; formerly it would have been called an "encephaloid Cancer-" G. C. 3322. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E. 1.6.

"There are here some peculiar circumstances, and a distressing alternate is offered to us. The tumour has all the appearance of fungus nematodes, or soft cancer. To the feeling it conveys the notion of a soft spongy mass, distending the fascia of the thigh. It is evidently under the muscles, and the vasti rectus and sartorius muscles bind it so as to give it a peculiarly irregular surface. The pain is very great, an incessant dull pain. While he describes his pain as a dull sensation, and in this expression distinguishes it from the occasional sharp and shooting pain of some tumours, yet his sufferings must be great in degree, since he expresses a desire to lose the limb. He is a steady man, and although not obtrusive nor loud m his complainings, he expressly wishes to lose his limb although he sees that in order to do this it must be cut off close to his body.

There is little doubt that a small part of the tumour had been left, or that the muscles, tainted by the contact, bad propagated the diseased action. The diseased portion, increasing with that rapidity which characterises this sort of tumour, had destroyed the coats of the vessel, and from this sprung the haemorrhage which proved fatal. Had the tumour been entire, the blood would only have run into the interstices of its texture, but being open and upon the face of the stump, the blood had free egress. The cavity on the stump was in all respects similar to that found in the centre of the tumour. " On dissecting out the head of the femur, and sawing it through and macerating it, the disease was seen to have propagated itself to the head of the bone and through the whole cancelli." The broken ends of the bone are seen over-lapping, and apparently at one or two places united by bone. The greater part of the interval between the broken ends, however, has been occupied by the tumour substance j some of it has fallen away, but what remains is soft, grey, and somewhat translucent. This material can also be seen occupying the medullary cavity above and below the seat of fracture. (See case of Phineas in Bell's "Surgical Observations and Reports," p. 376.) B. C. i. 1.

"This young man was a sailor, and three months before the appearance of the tumour of the leg, he received a blow on the upper part of the shin by the recoil of a gun. He does not attribute the growth of the tumour to this hurt, and it was only by questioning him as to all probable causes that this circumstance was brought to his recollection. The tumour extends from the middle of the tibia to the tendinous insertion of the patella into that bone. It surrounds the tibia and the head of the fibula, and evidently goes round to the back of the bones, for it has distended the gastro-cnemius and the soleus muscles. Its surface is distinguished by seven or eight distinct knobs or tubercles which are soft or yielding, and give no indication of solidity or ot scirrhous hardness. The tubercles on the lower part of the tumour have more firmness and solidity than these above. The surface is of a dark reddish colour ; the centre of the tubercles being of a yellowish colour, but crossed with numerous small veins, which give a venous or purplish- tinge. The tumour has been two months of acquiring its present magni- tude, and is not accompanied with pain. . . , " When this young man had been a few days in the Hospital, and when I had ascertained the disease to be that most mortal of tumours, the fungus tumour, called soft cancer, I informed him of his danger He was surprised that I should consider it so seriously, but threw himself entirely ■ into n v hands. In these circumstances such confidence only adds to the391 Sarcoma invading Bone. oppressive feelings which the anticipation gives rise to. At this time he had neither pain nor lameness. "Consultation.—Notwithstanding the frequent application of leeches and blisters to the base of the tumour, and rolling the limb and keeping the roller wet, the disease has made progress. There is now pain in the tumour; a new lobe or convexity has formed, presenting the' appearance of a suppuration pointing. Two spots on the old knobs have1 ulcerated and discharged a limpid fluid. The glands of the groin have enlarged very considerably, and they are tender. Do these circumstances, warrant amputation, and what is the chance of saving the life ? My colleagues look less despairingly on this case than I confess I do. It may be possible that the glands of the groin are inflamed only in consequence' of the leech bites and blisters ; but independent of this circumstance, I fear we shall see the disease take an unfavourable turn at the end of three months from its commencement. Amputation is determined upon as^ affording the only hope of saving his life. "4th day after amputation.—The glands of the thigh and groin have subsided in a very remarkable manner. During the operation the muscles of the thigh were unusually pale. On the first dressing the surface was pale, although there was partial adhesion. On the second! dressing the stump looked well, and the patient's health and spirits were' observed to be very good. But about the ninth day the stump looked ill : there came a profuse gleety discharge, and the granulations were pale. "March 10th.— The report is 'He looks ill, and has had rigours ;; here is the commencement of mischief.' " 12th.— For some days he has been looking ill, and falling low • he vomits everything he swallows. He has got some relief by the effer- vescing mixture with laudanum. His pulse is scarcely to be distin- guished. " 14th.—' The stump is much changed : it is dry, for there is very little secretion ; the soft parts have retracted, so as to expose the bone. His countenance has a dirty or dull gray colour. He is low and sick, and complains of a pain in his right side.' " 15th.—' He is sinking exactly as the former patient did. It is melancholy to see a young man, having no idea of a mortal disease, thus quickly cut off, and shocking to find this formidable disease so frequent, without affording any useful information to guide our future practice.'

"The amputated limb was injected, and it is preserved in the Museum. The veins injected from the saphena exhibited an extraordinary392 Diseases of Done. and rich network running on the face of the tumour. The tumour is split, and forcibly torn asunder, so as to show the tibia within it. The periosteum has separated from the bone and remains attached to the tumour. The surface of the bone is left rough and indented by the pressure of the tumour. The structure of this tumour is the same with those we have seen, only that it retains a great deal more of the cartilaginous firmness." B. C. I. 6. M. 26. CANCER (SECONDARY) OF BONE. 6. 464. Epithelioma invading- the Tibia.—Section of a tibia and adjacent soft parts, injected with carmine and gelatine—in spirit, illustrating the above. About thirty years before the amputation, the patient, a man aged 50, had sustained a compound fracture of the leg below the knee. Dr Gillespie, under whose care he then -was at the Old Royal Infirmary, advised amputation, but the patient declined. After a long illness, he recovered, but ever since had suffered from chronic pains in his tibia, and his ankle remained fixed in the extended position. The scar which had resulted from the injury alternately healed and broke out from time to time until lately, when it began to spread persistently, and became exuberant. Epithelioma of the scar was diagnosed, and the leg was amputated. The glands in his groin were found enlarged, and were excised at the same time. "When seen about a year after the operation, he was free from any return in the stump or groin, and was in excellent health. The preparation illustrates the warty character of gran- ulations which have become epitheliomatous, while the section shows how the epithelioma has been spreading downwards to the bone and eating into it.

Epithelioma and Chronic Suppuration eroding- and destroying the Tibia.—Lower three-fourths of a left tibia and fibula—macerated, illustrating the above. The leg was amputated for " spontaneous" fracture. As a boy, the patient, a man aged 45, had suffered from suppurative osteo-myelitis and periostitis ending in necrosis. The original wound had healed after some dead bone had been removed, but after an interval of several years had broken out again. More bone then came away, and the wound healed,Cancers invading Bone. 393 only to open again in a similar way after another interval. Three years hefore admission to the Royal Infirmary, the nicer had again broken out. Numerous pieces of bone had come away, and the tibia suddenly snapped one day as he was trying to walk. The sore had a most foetid odour, and was covered by masses of thickened epithelium, with here and there florid granulations which microscopically showed the characters of epithelioma. The tibia, opposite where the ulcer was, is irregularly eroded and destroyed, a result probably due partly to the old-standing osteo-myelitis, as well as partly to the more recent epithelioma. The fibula is greatly thickened near the site of the ulcer, as usually occurs in such cases, but both bones are somewhat lightened in texture, possibly owing to the comparative disuse of the limb. G.

This specimen shows that the tibia and fibula have been enlarged, as is usual, from their being in the neighbourhood of a chronic ulcer, but the destruction of the tibia is special, and is due to the inroads of epithelioma.

The lines of the incisions used at the operation were marked in when the cast was presented. The following note is by Professor Syme:—"Between eight and nine years ago, Eobert Penman, from Coldstream, then sixteen years old, noticed a hard swelling of the gum on the outer side of the grinding teeth of the lower jaw. The swelling was not painful, but gradually increased. When it attained the size of an egg he applied to a surgeon of the neigh- bourhood, who extracted three of the adjoining teeth. It then grew more rapidly, and having at length become as large as an orange, induced him to repair to the Royal Infirmary of this city, where it was removed, i.e., cut off from the bone. The wound did not heal, and the actual cautery- was repeatedly applied in vain to make it do so. After remaining eight months in the Infirmary, he returned home; but finding the tumour rapidly and regularly increasing, he two years afterwards came again to Edinburgh, and consulted a distinguished operating surgeon (now in London), who declined to make any attempt towards his relief. He went home with the fearful prospect of a certain lingering and painful dissolu- tion ; and it was after three years and a half spent in this miserable stale tbat Dr Sibbald of this city happened to see him. Though the tumour was then nearly three times larger than it was when the patient last quitted Edinburgh, Dr Sibbald felt persuaded that it was still within the reach of surgery, and therefore encouraged the young man to come once more to town, which he accordingly did.398 D iseases of Bone. "Though prepared for something very extraordinary, I certainly was astonished at first sight of the patient. " The mouth was placed diagonally across the face, and had suffered such a monstrous distension as to measure 15 inches in circumference. The throat of the patient was almost obliterated in appearance, there being only about two inches of it visible above the sternum, so that the cricoid cartilage of the larynx was on a level with that bone. When the tumour was viewed iu profile, it extended eight inches from the front of the neck. It completely filled the mouth, and occupied all the space below it from jaw to jaw. The tongue was thrust out of its place, and lay between the teeth and cheek of the right side. The only portion of the . jaw not implicated in the disease was the right ramus and base of the same side, from the bicuspid teeth backwards. The tumour, where covered by the integuments, was uniformly very firm, and for the most part distinctly osseous. The part which appeared through the mouth was a florid, irregular, fungous-looking mass of firm consistence, from which an alarming haemorrhage had occasionally, and for the last three or four weeks there had been almost daily a discharge of blood to the extent of one or two ounces. Notwithstanding the great bulk of the tumour, the patient could move his jaw pretty freely in all directions. "With the exception of the disease now described, Penman enjoyed good health. He was a tall, well- made, though much emaciated, intelligent young man, and possessed uncommon fortitude." The tumour, along with more than half the lower jaw, was removed by Mr Syme on 7th July 1828, and the patient made a good recovery. In 1848 Mr Syme added to the above:—" About two years ago, and consequently seventeen years after this operation, I was stopped in the street by a well-dressed, respectable-looking man, who- introduced him- self as Penman. He told me that after working for several years at home as a bootmaker, he had gone in quest of better wages to New York : that he had spent ten years in America, whence he had ju?t arrived ; and that he proposed to return there after a short visit to his native country. I was no less surprised than pleased to see how little the operation had injured either his appearance or articulation. Careful inspection, indeed, was required to enable an ordinary observer to detect anything peculiar in either of these respects."

William D., aged 10, was admitted into the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on 23rd July 1890. About three months ago patient noticed a small lump growing on his gum. The patient had some bad teeth extracted, which were supposed to have caused the swelling. He thinks it was less for a time, but shortly afterwards began to enlarge rapidly. Since that time it has remained much the same as it is now. Growing from the inferior maxilla, in the position of the two middle and left lateral incisor teeth, there was a rounded swelling projecting into the mouth, and dusky red in colour, except at the top, where it was pigmented. It was soft to the touch and bled easily. After the patient had been in Hospital for some time the swelling became firmer. He felt no pain from it, but could not masticate his food properly, and his mouth had a nasty taste and a foetid odour. The general health and family history are good. On 12th August 1890 the patient was put under chloroform, and Mr Cathcart freely excised the tumour, with the adjacent bone, and removed one or two large glands below the angle of the jaw. In August 1892 the boy was brought to the Infirmary to report himself. There was no return of the tumour, and he was in good health. There were some slight enlargements of the lymphatic glands below the lower jaw, but they were in all probability not connected with the tumour. The section of the tumour shows that it has grown out from the centre, and has caused absorption of the greater part of the bone, except along the lower border. G. C. 3207. 6. 485.

"Mrs Fraser, aged 40, from Banchoiy-Ternan, Aberdeenshire, was admitted into the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh on the 13th of October 1834, under the care of Mr Liston. "About six years ago she received a blow over the antrum, from the head of a child, immediately after which she perceived a slight hard- ness in the part which had been struck. This did not increase for some time after, but at the end of two years a distinct tumour was felt on the cheek. It grew very rapidly during the two following years. At this time she became pregnant, when, she says, it increased very much, especially after the quickening of the child. She had never suffered very much pain in it. About a year ago she had another child, since which time the catamenia have never appeared. The tumour seemed to her to grow more vascular after she had passed the menstrual period, and since then bleeding to a slight extent has occurred from the unbroken surface of the gums and inner surface of the tumour at these times when she should have been unwell. " On her admission the tumour presented the following appearance : —The left side of the face is completely occupied by an immense growth, which obstructs the eye of that side, rising to a level with the forehead, extending back to the ear, and bulging down below the inferior maxilla, but not attached to it. From the part of the tumour next to the ear to that part in front of the face, it measures about nine inches. The mouth is •completely drawn to the left side, and there is a constant discharge of saliva from it. She keeps a handkerchief constantly applied to it by the hand, to concentrate the sound of her voice when speaking, and to collect the saliva. She is unable to open her mouth above three-fourths of an inch. The tumour bulges considerably into the cavity of the mouth, but there is no difficulty of swallowing. The nose is also twisted to the left side but she can breathe through it pretty easily. From these distortions the face has a truly frightful appearance. Numerous large veins are seen beneath the integuments of the tumour, and arteries of considerable size are felt beating in it. Her general health is good, and she has firmly made up her mind to undergo the operation for removal of the tumour, on account of its inconvenience and unsightliness." (From "Observations on some Tumours of the Mouth and Jaw," by Robert Liston, Esq., mthe 20th vol 1837, of the Medico-Chirurgicai Transactions, London.) About two years afterwards the following note was given by the patient's local medical attendant, and is appended to Mr Liston's observa- tions previously quoted from.

In a word, she is one of the most happy women I am acquainted with." The following is the description of the original tumour, 'No. 2441, in the Catalogue of the Museum of the Koyal College of Surgeons, England, page 47 :—" The tumour is of irregular form, superficially lobeel, and smoothly rounded in every part. Its diameters are—vertically seven inches, transversely seven inches, and from before backwards nearly six inches; the portion of integument removed with it measures about twelve inches in length and ten in breadth. Towards the mouth the tumour presents a circular concave surface, projecting on every side beyond the palate.

The following is an excerpt from a " clinical lecture on the case of Hugh Morrison, aged 51, delivered by Sir George Ballingall to the- students of Surgery in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, at the conclusion of the summer course for 1827." " Four months ago (before admission to Infirmary), after exposure to cold, he was affected with pain in the molars. One of them was- extracted with a little relief, the alveolus was punctured, and about a gill of clotted blood evacuated. Complaint is attended with gnawing, lan- cinating pain, which becomes worse in the night, and he is much subject- to headache. General health good. "There is an extensive tumour in the region of the superior right maxillary and malar bones, bounded above by the tarsal edge of the lower eyelid, by the extremity of the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, and by the external angle of the frontal bone. Inferiorly, it extends- to below the level of the teeth of the upper jaw ; posteriorly, it is bounded by the zygomatic process and by the anterior edge of the ramus of the lower jaw : internally it has driven the inner wall of the antrum into the nostril, so that a probe is not easily passed through the inferior meatus ; the palatine process of the superior maxilla is softened, and also very much inclined inwards. Two of the bicuspid teeth are quite loose ; the remain- der of the teeth placed behind the above have been removed. Two or three glands upon the parotid are enlarged. The surface of the swelling is irregular—in some places soft, in others hard and cartilaginous. Vision, hearing, and smell on the affected side are all impaired ; the eye, however, is not protruded from the socket; deglutition is attended with some difficulty." The tumour was removed with considerable loss of blood ; but the patient recovered from the operation. The disease, however, returned, and on March 28th Mr Macpherson, his medical attendant at home, described " the appearance of the tumour to be truly appalling ; nearly the whole surface being in a state of active ulceration and occasional discharges of blood from the ulcerated vessels. The patient's appetite had completely failed. He was harassed with diarrhoja, and could not be expected to survive many days." The surface of the tumour is smooth at one part and wartyTumours of Upper Jaw. 405 and irregular at another.

Malignant Disease of the Antrum.—Eyeball and part of the right half of the bones of a face and skull—in spirit, showing extensive invasion. 1' Mr M., an elderly gentleman, of a broad brawny figure, and having a healthy constitution, came to town to-day (Aug. 1813), afflicted with this loathsome disease. It began early in June by slight pains affecting one of the upper frontal teeth of the left side—the side opposite to that in which the disease was situated. The pains resemble toothache, and excited some swelling of the gum, which, however, soon abated. Shortly after this, acute stinging pains attacked the gums of the upper jaw of theTumours of Uj^per Jcav. 407 right side, shooting to the crown of the head. These soon became so severe that he was unable to tell whether they originated in the gums or in the head. They were augmented in the night, but fortunately some times were relieved by perspiration, to which he was somewhat subject. The right side of the face, from the eye downwards to the mouth, now began to swell, attended by a degree of numbness, affecting chiefly the wing of the nose and the upper lip. The patient, conceiving the numbness to depend on languid circulation, used friction, which, having no effect, he tried bathing the neighbouring parts with rum. This, however, aggravated the pain. He then put himself upon low diet, bathed his feet now and then at bed-time, and took occasionally laxatives, but all to no purpose. His eyes now became tender and sore, but showed little tendency to inflame. The eye of the affected side soon became weaker and the vision to be so much impaired that he dreaded he would lose the sight of it. It shortly afterwards became swollen and protruded. " On the day of his arrival in town he had a robust constitution, had a firm step, a hale voice, and a round full face. But the right eye was swollen and protruded, the eyelid tumid and oedematous, with tunica conjunctiva bulging out from beneath them, thus completely shutting up the eye. He complained of the same toothache-like pains affecting the jaw and darting to the crown of the head ; the benumbed sense of feeling in the ala nasi and mouth. These parts hung loosely, and quivered when he spoke, indicating paralysis. On opening the eyelids, the eye itself was sound and of its natural form and size, but evidently raised from its socket. There was no swelling in the cheek, no obstruction in the nostril, no disease of the teeth, no tumour in the throat. But by introducing the finger within the mouth, there could be felt a small tumour immediately above the first grinding tooth'of the affected side; and on the outside this felt soft. By pressing this tumour a yellow serum flowed out at the nostril. The gum covering the bulbous process of the superior maxillary bone, and where the three backmost grinders had been, felt soft and spongy,' resembling softened bend-leather. These teeth had gradually decayed. They had not been forced out by the disease. He was able to eat pretty heartily, and take a walk around the town." The tumour increased rapidly, and the patient's system sunk accordingly. On 6th September, Mr Bell, under whose care he was, attempted partial operation, but the tumour was not removed, and the patient got rapidly worse, and died on the 28th. "Dissection.— The ball of the eye had suppurated and burst. The cheek was one great abscess. The cheek bone and walls of the antrum were completely carious. The tumour was now seen arising from the fatty substance at the bottom of the eye, and the upper and part of the antrum, and from these running obliquely outwards to the cheek, where it was bound down to the alveolar processes by adhesions. In some places the tumour was lobular, and resembled in form and colour a salivary gland, while in others it was granular and gristly. Around the membranousDiseases of Bone. 408 surface of the antrum there were many little granular tubercles. These likewise studded the palate and throat, the membranes of which were soft and swollen. The septa of the nostrils were thickened." The tumour has invaded and replaced the hones forming the floor and inner wall of the orhit, as well as those forming the wall of the antrum. G.

"About four years ago the woman, Susanna Todd, aged 39, had a small tumour of the size of half a hazel-nut on the gum over the first molaris of the upper jaw. It continued to increase for two years. At this time a medical gentleman thrust his lance into it, but nothing but blood flowed from it. The wound did not heal, and from that time the tumour rapidly increased for the space of a year, bleeding from time to time. She observes that these bleedings always relieved her, so that she was at this time suffering pain. The tumour had now enlarged the alveolar process, and appeared as a tumour on the cheek. She went into Hospital, and they drew two of the molares, and cut away a portion of the gum ; but she derived no further advantage from this than that for a time she was freed from the portion of the tumour which projected into the mouth and plagued her in eating. She was eight months in the Hospital. While she was attending there, they thrust a probe into her nostrils, to which she attributes the blindness of the left eye; but this is evidently a fancy of hers. "From the Hospital she was carried to the workhouse, and nothing further took place but the gradual increase of the tumour, which about three weeks ago produced a dimness of vision in the left eye, and in three days the sight was totally lost. " She has now a large tumour of the whole left cheek, which appears like an irregular swelling of all the bones of the face. The alveolar processes are much enlarged, and project so that the upper jaw shoots far outbefore the range of the lower jaw. The tumour extends from the base of the lower jaw to the inner canthns of the right eye : it presses in upon the orbit, and has, in some degree, displaced the left eye. It has thrust the nose aside also; a fungous irregular tumour occupies the whole of the left side of the mouth and affects all the palate : it has shot back into the fauces, and presses upon the mouth of the Eustachian tube of the left side. " March 15.—The tumour has considerably increased, for although it be flatter at the lower part of the cheek towards the eye, it is enlarged,410 Diseases of Bone. smoother, and more discoloured; the fungus in the mouth is more luxuriant." The patient shortly afterwards died. The specimen shows that the bones forming the anterior and middle fossa? of the skull on the left side and most of those on the right have been replaced by the tumour, which seems to have crept along their substance. The bones of the face on the left side, and greater part of those on the right, have been similarly involved. The left eyeball has been pushed out by the tumour from behind. B. C. I. 6.

Sarcomatous "Polypus" of Turbinate Bones and Upper Jaw.—Part of a right half of the skull of a young man, showing a large tumour growing into the nasal cavity and antrum, and causing absorption of bone by its pressure—in spirit. "Mr W., a tall young man of a delicate form and sickly com- plexion, came to town in July 1813, to consult Mr J. Bell about a polypus m Ins right nostril. He was a farmer in East Lothian. He was attacked about eight months before with profuse bleeding from the nose, so pro- fuse as to endanger life. Alarmed by this bleeding, he sent for assistance but the surgeon assured him on this, as on several other occasions, that it was merely a bleeding from the nose, not connected with any other disease. As the bleeding each time increased, he was, by the time of his yellow hue which mdicates great weakness from hemorrhage, and is most notrced in the hemorrhage during pregnancy and childhood A large polypus could be felt occupying the left nostril Tt in some degree affected his voice. Although the danger of his disoL, walDiseases of Bone. 412 strongly pointed out to him, he could not be persuaded to remain in town until he had seen his harvest got in. With this view he set out for his farm, where he remained for nearly two months, scarcely a day of which passed without his losing an alarming quantity of blood. "On the 20th of September, when he returned, he looked an emaciated creature, his face ghastly and bloodless, his frame languid and exhausted, scarcely able to drag one limb after another. "The tumour was now making its way in every direction through the carious bones. The right nostril was so occupied by the tumour that not a breath of air could be forced through it. The cheek was not swollen, but a small knobby tumour occupied the space between the ala nasi, infra- orbitary hole and canine tooth of the right side. It had forced its way through the walls of the antrum. A portion of the tumour had made its appearance in the form of a small papilla at the alveolar socket of the third grinder. This tooth had been pulled by a dentist, who imagined the disease to be toothache. The tumour likewise passed down behind the palate, obstructing in some degree his swallowing, and affecting a little his voice. '' Mr Bell first tried the caustic by passing it high into the nostrils ; but finding that its roots were so protected by the walls of the antrum that there was no chance of reaching them, he made an oblique incision in the cheek, about three inches long, and found the tumour projecting through a hole in the antrum, the bones of which were completely carious. A probe could be passed through this hole across the cavity into the nostril, and down the throat. Mr Bell now tried to reach its roots by holding down the projecting lobe of the tumour, and directing the caustic towards the angle of the eye, inclining it a little towards the throat. In this, however, Mr Bell confesses to have entirely failed, for there inter- vened between this hole in the cheek and the roots so large a portion of the tumour, that, instead of passing over it, he transfixed it. By frequent applications of the caustic this portion was converted into a sac or bag, with a round mouth sufficient to admit the point of the thumb. A happy effect resulted from the applications, for, from the time that the caustic was first applied, the hemorrhage never recurred. "The pains which he suffered from the tumour were of the most rending and distracting kind, frequently darting through the head. He had frequent accessions of fever and diarrhoea. At each attack of fever he was confined to bed, and for some days tortured with sickness and retching. During the intervals of these paroxysms he was wont to sit cheerless and moaning over the fire, holding his head in his hands, resting on his knees. His countenance was now more pallid and death-like ; his eyes heavy, sunk, and languid ; his hearing much impaired, and his brain beginning to suffer. Stupor had already taken place. "By slightly astringent injections thrown into the antrum, by occasional opiates and astringent mixtures, by soft nourishing diet, with wine and other cordials, a melancholy existence was dragged out, with many intervening scenes of great distress, until February 1814, whenTumours of Facial Bones. 413 suddenly the haemorrhage which had heen so long suppressed burst forth with great violence. It was immediately stemmed by wedging a sponge into the opening of the cheek. However, at midnight it again burst forth, and before any assistance could be rendered he was found extended, pale, and almost lifeless ; the whole face enormously swollen ; the opening in the cheek and the projecting tumour black, like gangrene, and exhaling an intolerable fcetor. For the two following days he lay in a state of stupor, and then expired. "Dissection.—The walls of the antrum were completely carious. The tumour was seen arising in a fiat membranous expansion from the upper spongy bones, becoming bulky and fleshy in the nostril, where it adhered to its floor, and occupied the top of the" {sic) " equally bulky and bag-like, where it extended across the antrum to the alveolar aperture, where the tooth had been drawn, and to the foramen which it had made near the infra-orbitary hole." The tumour has apparently had its origin from the back of the ethmoid and the tissues in the neighbourhood of the spheno- maxillary fissure. From this point it has grown downwards into the naso-pharynx, and forwards through the antrum on to the cheek. Its surface is shreddy and irregular towards the nose, but more uniform towards the cheek. The tumour substance is for the most part soft and diffluent. The tumour has caused absorption by its mechanical presence, but it does not seem to have infiltrated the surrounding parts. G. C. 968. 6. 514.

The sagittal suture is continued forwards as a permanent frontal suture to the nasal bones. There is no trace whatever of the coronal suture.

The vault of the skull is unsymmetrical, slanting more obliquely on the right side, while it is rounded a little more than usual on the left, as if the skull, in a plastic state, had been flattened towards the left from pressure on the right side.

This skull is from the same subject from whom No. 6. 6 and others were taken, and which illustrated an unusual form of senile decay. The changes in the skull, however, may be taken as illustrating those of ordinary senile decay. The sutures on the vault are more or less obliterated. The bones are light, and in many places are atrophied. The outer walls of the orbits, for instance, are in great measure deficient, and the walls of the antrum are as thin as paper. The alveolar borders of the upper and lower jaws are greatly atrophied. The lower jaw is completely cedentulous; its angle is obtuse, and the narrowed mental foramen on each side opens at or near its upper border. On the upper jaw there are sockets for the roots or stumps of two incisors, and the bone near the sockets is less atrophied than it is elsewhere. The under surface of the skull is somewhat porous. The thickness of theDiseases of Bone. 416 vault does not seem to have been altered. The " diploe " is for the most part unduly porous, although here and there it has been obliterated. G. C. 3225.

The change is well seen in the frontal bones, where the orbital plates having been pulled upwards, and the frontal bones thrust outwards, the two- have come to form part of a continuous sweep. The upper part of the child's head has been entirely membranous, and large spaces intervene between the parietal bones and those with which they should articulate, as well as between the upperHydrocephalic Skulls. 419 halves of the frontal bones. The ossification of the frontal bones is very imperfect; numerous patches of membrane show themselves in the course of the bone.

ABNORMALITIES IN GROWTH OR DEVELOPMENT. 7. 1. Congenital Anchylosis of the Superior Radio-ulnar Joint.—Eight radius and ulna—macerated, illustrating the above. The bones are in the position of complete pronation. The upper end of the radius is fused with the adjacent part of the ulna, the head of the radius being represented by a small knot projecting from the outer side of the greater sigmoid cavity. There has therefore been no capitellar surface, and probably no capitellum. The bones are separated below. The shaft of the ulna is thin, and its bony ridges are sharp and not in their usual position. This specimen is stated to have been taken from a child. From this fact, as well as from the absence of indication of previous disease, it has been considered a congenital mal- formation. B. C. n. M. 52. II.

Acute Suppurative Inflammation of the Shoulder.— Eight shoulder-joint of a woman, opened from above—in spirit, illustrating the above. Six weeks before admission to the Royal Infirmary, the patient, Betty Cacldell, received a fall, which injured the right shoulder. It continued painful and much swollen until the period of her admission, when the whole extremity was oedematous. When the swelling of the shoulder was pressed, a gurgling sound was produced, as of air passing through aDiseases of Joints. 426 fluid. On making a small incision into the abscess, much gas, smelling of sulphuretted hydrogen, came away, with a thin, foetid, greenish-coloured pus. Two days after admission two incisions were made into the abscess in the shoulder. The joint could be felt exposed, by a large ulcerated opening through the capsular ligament. A very large abscess was opened soon after in the lower part of the arm, and greenish matter, thin and foetid, was discharged. The opening into the upper part of the joint has heen artificially enlarged. The cartilage at the margin of the arti- cular surface has disappeared, leaving the hone exposed helow. An early stage of the same process is seen at the middle of the head of the humerus. G. C. 1199. Presented by Adam Hunter, F.R.C.S.E., 1828. 7. 5. Suppurative Osteo-myelitis of the Head of the Humerus, involving- the Shoulder-joint.—Upper end of the left humerus of a child—in spirit, illustrating the above. '1 The patient was a fine little boy of two years. While amusing itself at its mother's foot about two months previously, it stumbled, and was falling forward, when the mother caught hold of the left arm, by which indeed she prevented the fall, but unfortunately injured the shoulder-joint severely. The joint soon after swelled and became inflamed, and an abscess forming, considerable discharge took place. The donor of the preparation, when first consulted, probed the sore, and found the bone carious, but made a free incision in the hopes that nature would effect a cure. This did not take place, and the child's health appearing to be rapidly suffering, the removal of the bone was determined on. The case seemed doing well for a few days, but a violent attack of erysipelas supervened, from which he never recovered, but died in about a fortnight after the removal of the carious bone. '' The internal structure of the bone was found nearly destroyed. A few small pieces were found floating in the cavity. The cartilages of the joint were found during the operation to have been partially anchylosed. An exceedingly small quantity of blood was lost by the patient during the operation." The specimen shows a large cavity in the head of the hone, containing a loose, necrosed fragment. G. C. 1199. Presented by Adam Hunter, F.R.C.S.E., 1828. 7. 6. Suppurative Osteo-myelitis of the Femur, involving*427 Suppurative Arthritis. the Knee-joint.—Lower end of a right femur, with the articular end of tibia—in spirit, illustrating the above. "From a patient in the Royal Infirmary, 26 years of age. Seven years previously an abscess formed and discharged at the outside of the thigh, when several portions of the bone came away. Two months before amputation the bone became affected with severe pain. After his admission to the Hospital, which was five weeks after the commencement of this attack, several ounces of purulent matter were discharged from the outer and upper part of the knee. His general health was much affected. He had a quick pulse, flushings, diarrhoea, and morning sweats. Ampu- tation was performed ; these subsided, and he recovered, so that he left the Hospital well in four weeks." The specimen shows considerable thickening on the surface of the lower end of the femur, with, in addition, on the back and outer sides, apertures leading into the bone, and on the outside a small necrosed fragment in process of separation. The articular surface of the femur shows several patches of bare necrosed bone, like islands in the cartilage; these, though unchanged on the surface, seem loosened from below. The changes on the patella are superficial. This seems to have been primarily a case of osteo-myelitis, extending afterwards to the joint. G. C. 2232. Presented by Alexander Watson, F.R.C.S.E., 1838. 7. Suppurative Osteo-Myelitis of the Femur, involving" the Knee-joint.—Lower end of the right femur of a young person—macerated, showing changes similar to those in the previous specimen. This one was originally entered in the Catalogue as a case of white swelling, but it is more like the above. On the popliteal surface of the femur, white necrotic fragments of bone are seen, and below them the original bone is rarefied, while higher up, and extending round to the front, there is a considerable development of new periosteal bone. The articular surface on the inner condyle of the femur shows a bare necrotic patch, surrounded by rarefied, partially absorbed bone tissue. One or two roughened patches are seen on othor parts of the articular surface. G. C. 372.Diseases of Joints. 8. Suppurative Osteo-Myelitis of the Femur, involving- Hip-joint.—Left innominate bone and upper end of femur of a young person—macerated, illustrating the above. The angle which the neck of the femur forms with the shaft is very obtuse. At and below the level of the small trochanter the bone is irregular in shape and condensed, while, on the front of the head and neck and great trochanter, the bone is greatly rarefied (carious), and the articular surface of the femur in many places is rough and bare. Below the outside of the great trochanter a sinus runs upwards into the bone. This condition has all the appearance of having begun as an acute osteo-myelitis of the upper end of the shaft. The disease has evidently involved the hip-joint, producing rare- factive ostitis in the head and neck, and has led to new bone formation below the level of the trochanter. G. C. 631. b.

Septic Inflammation of the Hip-joint.—Upper end of a left femur, with the soft parts outside the joint dissected off —in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient, a young man, had been treated in the Koyal Infirmary, Edinburgh, for a large abscess in the left inguinal region, above the situation of the inguinal ring. This was opened, and much matter was discharged. He was beginning to improve, when seized with sudden pain in the inside of his thigh and knee. Symptoms of septic absorption, indicated by fever, sweating, and afterwards delirium, came on, and he died exhausted in about a fortnight. ■ This was probably a psoas abscess, which had pointed in the abdominal wall, and after having been opened, had turned septic and communicated with the hip-joint. "The ligamentum teres was absorbed, and the cartilage covering the head of the bone, and also that lining the acetabulum, could scarcely be said to exist." The greater part of the bone is bare of cartilage, and the bone below is rarefied. G. C. 1101. Presented by Sir George Ballingall.Suppurative Arthritis. 429 7. 10. Septic Inflammation of Knee-joint.—Eight knee- joint laid open—in spirit, illustrating the effects of the ahove. The patient, a man aged 35, was admitted to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on account of extensive abscesses of the leg and thigh from erysipelas. Purulent effusion afterwards took place into the knee-joint; hectic fever and diarrhoea supervened. Amputation was performed, and he recovered. The cartilage has disappeared round the edges of the articular surface of the lower end of the femur. The bone from which the cartilage has disappeared is smooth in some places, while at others, e.g. at the inner condyle, it is rarefied. G. C. 2233. Presented by Alexander Watson, F.R.C.S.E., 1838. 7.11. Septic Inflammation in the Knee-joint.—Section of an injected knee-joint—in spirit, illustrating the ahove. The patient was an elderly man, who had suffered from what seemed to be hydrops-articuli, i.e. a chronic distension of the knee, the nature of which, however, was obscure—perhaps rheumatic, possibly tubercular. The joint was aspirated, and a clear fluid drawn off. Soon afterwards the joint inflamed and the fluid then drawn off was purulent. Suppuration extended into the thigh and calf, and amputation became necessary. The patient developed phthisis, and lingered for many weeks with a chronic suppuration in the thigh. He eventually sank from exhaustion. The articular surface of the femur is bared of cartilage and rarefied (carious) where it was in contact with the tibia. At other places the cartilage is loosened, and has been falling off, while at others it is vascular and has been injected. The articular surface of the tibia is quite bare, and the exposed bone is soft and inflamed. The articular surface of the patella is injected. The synovial membrane is thrown out into soft vascular processes. Caseous glands are seen in section in the popliteal space. Probably the joint in this case became septic after the aspiration. q q 3375 Presented by A. G. Miller, F.K.C.S.E., 1892. 2.

Lower end of a left tibia—macerated, illustrating the above. The patient had fallen from a great height and so alighted on the ground as to injure his ankle-joint. The leg was amputated some time after the accident for what was supposed to be a scrofulous affection of the ankle-joint, but which has probably been suppuration owing to the septic disease of the bone. The lower end of the tibia has evidently been split vertically into an anterior and posterior portion. The latter, carrying the malleolus, is on a higher level than the former, and there is a fissure between them. A portion of the original articular surface remaining on the anterior fragment has evidently necrosed, and has been in process of separation, for it only remains attached now by a small stem on the inner side. The rest of the articular surface is carious. The surface of the lower end, especially at the back, is covered with irregular newly- formed nodules. B. C. n. M. 38. 7. 14.

Similar characteristics are seen round the upper end of the tibia, where the two semi-lunar cartilages were covered by gelatinous material. On the femur the growth of the vascular synovial membrane between the surface for the patella and that for the tibia has separated the joint into two, one cavity above and one below the ligamentum mucosum and the ligamentum alaria.

An encroachment of the diseased synovial membrane has taken place upon the cartilage of the femur, especially opposite the ligamentum mucosum and the ligamenta alaria, and round the patella, whose cartilage is also at one place ulcerated through. The interior of the synovial membrane has numerous delicate fringed processes hanging from it. G. C. 541. 7. 18. Tubercular Synovitis.—Right knee-joint, laid open from the front—in spirit, illustrating the above. There has been an encroachment of the diseased synovial membrane upon the trochlear surface from above and laterally, and also, as in the previous specimens, in the position of the ligamentum mucosum and the ligamenta alaria. Similar to the last also, but more advanced, is the affection round the patellar cartilage. It should be remembered that what now appear to be layers of lymph covering the cartilage have been in the recent condition vascular granulations (see 7. 16 and the next specimens). 2449. Presented by J. Bell Pettigbew, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 19. Tubercular Synovitis.—Section of an injected knee-joint —in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient, a lad of 15, had first felt pain in the joint in November 1886. This was followed by a swelling, which began on the outside, and spread all over the joint. An abscess was opened in March 1887, and healed in four months, after which he went about quite well, except that a little swelling still remained. In March 1888 the disease again broke out; an abscess formed, and continued to discharge after having been opened. The joint gradually grew worse, and the limb was amputated in October 1888. At no time were there starting pains at night. The pain was never great. The chief complaint was swelling and stiffness. The injected synovial membrane is seen encroaching on433 Tubercular Synovitis of Knee-joint. the articular surface of the femur at the margins, and opposite the ligamentum mucosum and the ligamenta alaria. The interior of the epiphyseal end of the shafts of the femur and tibia is in each case fatty, and when fresh was of a brown chocolate colour. The interior of the epiphyses themselves seems healthy. Much fibrous tissue has been formed around the joint, and had anchylosed it, thus accounting for the absence of starting pains. The skin on the side shows marks of a previous ulcer formed after one of the abscesses had burst. G. C. 2812. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 20. Tubercular Synovitis.—Section of an injected knee-joint —in spirit, illustrating the above. Tor some months the patient had heen treated with rest by splints, and also for a time in bed. As the disease was not checked, tbe joint was opened and scraped. Improvement was only temporary. The resulting sinuses refused to heal, and as the patient's general health began to fail, amputation was performed. When the section was first made, the shafts of the tibia and femur next to the knee-joint epiphyses were congested, and of a deep chocolate colour, and the bone was softened and fatty. The texture of the epiphyses seemed healthy. The cartilaginous surfaces are being attacked in the usual way. The periosteum was easily stripped off, and was detached in making the section. G.

The injection has passed well into the tibia, but imper- fectly into the femur and synovial membrane. The cartilaginous surface of the femur on the upper (inner) section is entirely covered by granulations, very few of which 2 E434 Diseases of Joints. •are seen on the other half (below). The fatty condition of the epiphyseal end of the shaft of the femur is very marked, and the same may be seen on the tibia, but to a less extent. As in the previous specimens, the condition of the epiphyses seems healthy, while that of the adjacent ends of the shaft is fatty and of a dark brown colour. G. C. 3182. Presented by A. G.

Parts of a knee-joint removed by excision—in spirit, showing slight outward dislocation of the tibia, with extensive destruction of the cartilaginous surfaces. Four years before admission to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, the patient, a lad aged 20, in jumping into a cart, had struck his knee ■on the tram. Displacement occurred at once, and remained in spite of repeated attempts to restore it. Before operation the joint was swollen, slightly flexed, tender to the touch, and painful when moved. The tibia was displaced outwards and slightly rotated backwards. At the operation the articular surfaces were found to have adhesions in process of formation. These had to be broken down to allow of the excision. In this case tubercular synovitis distinctly followed the injury. The articular cartilages of the joint have been entirely replaced by irregular granulations, now blanched and shrivelled by the spirit. G. C. 2890. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 23.

At the margins of the trochlear surface, and at the site of the ligamenta alaria, the cartilage is replaced by the encroaching synovial membrane, which has spread over it. Upon the front of the trochlear surface, and upon the under surface of the inner and slightly also of the outer condyle, the cartilage has been undermined, and lies in loose flakes and tags. The cartilaginous surface of the patella has also suffered both from the encroachment and the undermining forms of invasion. G. C. 2843. Presented by Professor T. Annandale. 7. 25.

The upper and inner part of the trochlear surface of the femur shows the gradual growth upon it of the vascular synovial membrane, but the rest of the articular surface of the femur is comparatively unchanged, except for a narrow band of vascularity between the outer condyle and the trochlear surface. The upper part of the synovial membrane has been much affected. It has been caseous, and at the inner side has broken down, to form a tubercular abscess, which has burrowed under the vastus internus, and is now seen to contain the curdy and flocculent material, characteristic of tubercular abscesses.

The articular cartilages have been attacked round the margins here and there, especially upon the inner condyle, the outer part of the trochlear surface of the femur, and on the patella. The bone in these places is exposed, and the cartilage either removed entirely or partly detached. The synovial membrane is involved all round, and two sinuses, one above either condyle, communicate between the joint and the skin. The femur is thickened by a deposit of new periosteal bone round the shaft. F. P. C. 2965. 7. 27.

The articular cartilage of the femur has been entirely destroyed, except upon a narrow area round the edge. The trochlear surface and that of the inner condyle is covered with granulations, and the under surface of the outer condyle is irregularly hollowed out. On the outer aspect of the femur the walls of an abscess cavity are shown communicating in two places with the interior of the joint, as well as with another abscess beneath the subcrureus muscle. This illustrates the mode of formation of these abscesses. Portions of the thickened, gelatinous, synovial membrane caseate, soften, and run together to form an abscess.

The patient, Mary W., aged 25, had complained first of her knee, six years before. She was then a field worker. Under rest and blistering the symptoms subsided, but reappeared when work was renewed. This occurred several times, the longest interval of health being for a year in 1884, and again in 1886. In December 1887 pain and swelling became much worse. A Thomas splint then tried was found of no use, and in April 1888 she came to Dr John Duncan's wards with the knee in the condition indicated by the cast. A puffy swelling was present also at the outer part of the ankle-joint. This, together with the patient's wish, determined Dr Duncan to amputate rather than to excise. The cast shows the uniform globular swelling of the joint characteristic of tubercular synovitis. Gr. C. 2789. Presented by Chakles W. Cathcaet, F.R.C.S.E. 7.30.

The patella is thrown down over the tibia. There had been recent suppuration within the joint. The only portions of articular cartilage remaining are seen on the outer condyle and the outer half of the trochlea of the femur. The rest of the articular cartilage is replaced partly by recent granulations, indicated by the strong colour, partly by fully formed fibrous tissue, which covers the articular surface of the patella and the upper part of the trochlear surface of the femur.

The cast therefore illustrates removal of articular cartilage, and substitution of vascular granulations in its place. These may (1) develop on into bone (osseous anchylosis); or (2) into fibrous tissue (as in this case at certain parts, where it formed a fibrous covering for the articular surface) • (3) break down into- suppuration; or (4) continue to invade the bone. In this case the fibrous tissue covering part of the condyles was the effect of the organisation of granulations formed at- previous attacks. In places the granulations were recent. G. C. 2789. a.

M. 15. 7. 34. Tubercular Synovitis, involving the Cartilage and Bone.—Cast—in gelatine and glycerine—rof the articular surfaces of a knee-joint, laid open, after amputation, for the above. David H., aged 42, at the age of 16, was attacked with excessive vomiting and sickness, followed by pain and swelling of the knee. This ended in an abscess near the knee, which was opened. It closed and re-opened, when it discharged some pieces of bone. This opening and closing went on for about fourteen years, when a large piece of bone was removed, probably from the tibia. He then remained apparently well for about twelve years. Two and a half months ago he had pains in his leg, which were considered rheumatic. This was followed by swelling of the knee, and he was admitted to the Koyal Infirmary. An abscess over the near condyle of the femur was opened but soon turned septic, and other abscesses formed round about and burrowed in the calf of the leg. As his constitution was suffering and his knee getting worse, the leg was amputated. The cast shows that the articular cartilage is left only at one place, viz., on the outer half of the trochlear surface. The greater part of the rest is covered by vascular granulations, but upon the inner condyle are seen two patches of what was bare, smooth, necrotic bone. The articular surface of the tibia is covered by vascular granulations. The cicatrix of the former abscess is seen round the head of the tibia.Diseases of Joints. 440 The early history of this case is more like that of acute suppurative osteo-myelitis, but the later condition is evidently tubercidar, although complicated by sepsis.

Mrs L., aged 41, was admitted to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh,441 Ttibercular Synovitis of Knee-joint. on 26th October 1891, complaining of a jumping pain in her left knee, when going to sleep. She had no pain when sitting with her leg hanging, but when lying down had pain. She first felt a pain in her knee fourteen years ago, without any apparent cause. It has gradually increased, especially during the last two years. The knee has been blistered with but little effect. The knee is now bent at an angle of 130°, and the leg is everted. There is a wasting of muscles above and below the joint, and the circumference of the joint is two inches greater than on the sound side. The knee was excised on 30th October. The wound healed slowly, leaving a sinus, which was gouged out on 5th January 1892. The necrosed piece was denser than the rest, and on section, when fresh, showed the following points, viz., near the articular surface a layer which was of an opaque yellow colour; next to that one of a more clear, bluish, translucent colour; then the line of demarcation, with soft granulation tissue, and beyond that the cancellous bone. The lower piece of the specimen has been macerated to illustrate the rarefied condition of the bone. The tipper part of the articular surface is covered by shrivelled granulations and has been irregularly eroded. G. C. 3341. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 38.

The following account is from a clinical lecture by Siri 442 Diseases of Joints. George Ballingall, delivered to the Students of Surgery in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, at the conclusion of the winter course for 1828-1829. "This poor girl," Helen Coghill, " was admitted on 8th October, and the following report entered in the Journal: 'The left knee is swelled, hot and painful ; the patella is movable, but the slightest movement or pressure upon the bone is attended with very severe pain in the condyles of the femur. The limb is kept constantly in the extended posture. Pulse natural, tongue clean, belly regular.

Eighteen months ago, after a similar accident, the inflammation was much aggravated, and has been more severe than ever during the last seven weeks. Applic. Herucl. xx. genu.' " Subsequent to this various remedies were employed, but without any very obvious or permanent relief, and on the 3rd November I find the following report entered in the Journal:— " 1 Took three grains of opium and slept a little ; pulse 124 ; tongue slightly furred ; no sweating; bowels regular ; appetite rather worse. Previous to her admission she had been cupped, and leeches had been applied with benefit. Since her admission she had been leeched three times, and cupped three times to a large amount, and has also had a blister applied, but the disease has certainly become worse.' " Leeches were again applied, and were followed at a short interval by the use of the moxus on either side of the patella; but none of the remedies seemed to check the progress of the disease. The pain was so exquisite, upon any attempt to move the limb, as to preclude any satis- factory examination of the joint. Her appetite failed ; she was occasionally distressed with nausea and retching, and her bowels became greatly disordered. In short, her sufferings were so severe as to induce her to seek relief by the removal of the limb ; but when this was seriously proposed to her, she requested permission to consult her friends on the subject; and it was not until the 5th of December that she made up her mind to the operation, which was immediately performed. She seemed relieved, even before the operation was completed. She took seventy drops of laudanum, and slept a little on the following night. She left the Hospital on the 3rd of January. "On laying open the joint, after the amputation of the limb, the disease in this poor girl's knee was found to have made very extensive ravages. The preparation, which I now again exhibit to you, shows that the cartilages covering all the bones of the joint, with the exception of that on the inner condyle of the femur, were either entirely destroyed or floating loose, being completely detached from the bones." In most places the articular surfaces are covered by granu- lations, now blanched and shrivelled by spirit, but detached pieces of cartilage are seen here and there, and on the innerTubercular Synovitis of Knee-joint. 443 condyle there is a piece of the smooth necrotic hone so often seen in advanced cases of tubercular arthritis.

' The patient, a boy T.M., aged 14, had been troubled for three years .before admission to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, with his knee. For the last two years there had been swelling, but very little pain. When admitted, seven weeks before the amputation, the joint was uniformly enlarged with a large peri-articular abscess on the inner side. For a time after this abscess was opened, the patient did well, but the wound became septic. The temperature then rose to 103° F. and kept there. Intense pain accompanied any attempt at movement, and there were starting pains at night. Hematuria set in. Before the amputation these symptoms had somewhat subsided under free drainage, and daily syringing out the knee-joint with 1 -1000 corrosive sublimate lotion. When laid open after the amputation the joint was found to contain pus. The articular surfaces were eroded, leaving the hone bare, hut not soft. At places numerous necrosed fragments lay loose on the surface of the bone, and a cavity existed in the head of the tibia. The cast shows the narrow rim of cartilage which was left in the femur and the patella, and the irregularity of the rest of the surface covered by granulations. G. C. 2801. Presented by Charles W.

He, however, died some days after the removal of the limb, in which no healing process ever took place. . . . The joint after removal showed incurable disease, viz., deep-seated abscesses filled with scrofulous-looking matter occupying the bone and extending a considerable way down the leg. The articular cartilages covering the condyles of the femur, the patella, and surface of the tibia were almost entirely destroyed. Finally, the bones were deeply affected with caries, the tibia to a great extent." Besides a general rarefaction of the articular surfaces, the specimen shows deep erosions similar to those in former specimens, on the outer articular surface of the tibia, and on the outer condyle of the femur. (In the recent state such erosions are occupied by tubercular caseous granulations with or without fragments of necrotic bone.) Towards the back of the outer condyle of the femur there is a small patch of smooth bone surrounded by a trench in the bone texture, and beyond that by the general surface of rarefied cancellous bone. This is a necrosed fragment in process of separation, like that seen in 7. 34. It is to be noted that, as in several previous specimens, there is very little new periosteal formation round the articular surfaces. The whole of the bones are lightened. G-. C. 864.

The cartilage has been under- mined, as if tubercular foci in the epiphysis had gradually extended themselves into the bone as well as towards the joint.. The cartilage upon the outer tuberosity of the tibia, and upon the back of the inner one, is not much affected, but some absorption of the cartilage has occurred on the front of the inner tuberosity, possibly by extension from the femur.

The surface left where the bone has disappeared is rarefied, and shows numerous necrotic fragments in process of separation. There is also a scale of necrotic bone in process of separation, on the outer side of the shaft above the gap.

In the femur a portion of the articular surface below each condyle exactly fits the articular surfaces on the tibia, and is comparatively unchanged. In front of this the arti- cular surface on each condyle is deficient, and on the outside it is deeply eroded. Above the articular surface there is a circular aperture about an inch in diameter, leading to a large cavity within the bone, opening posteriorly. A thin crust of new periosteal bone has been formed on the surface for three or four inches above the lower end. On the outer tuberosity of the tibia the articular surface is unusually concave, and projects above the surrounding bone, but it is not eroded. The articular surface on the inner tuberosity is of a similar shape, but in addition both it and the surrounding bone have been eroded and excavated by tubercular granulations. There is also a roughening by periosteal deposit of the sides of the inner tuberosity. This has been a case where the interior of the lower end of the femur has been greatly affected although there has also been anchylosis of the joint in the straight position. G. C. 374. 7.76.

The joint was from a patient in the Royal Infirmary, 50 years of age, who recovered after amputation of the limb. He had fallen into the hold of a ship 38 years previously, by which he received a severe injury of the knee—swelling, pain, stiffness, and abscesses about the joint followed. These abated, but left the joint quite stiff and bent at a right angle. Four months before he came to the hospital, abscesses again formed, attended with considerable constitutional disturbance. One of these left an external opening into the joint. The joint has evidently been flexed, and the patella is anchylosed to the under surface of the outer condyle. The posterior part of the outer condyle is wanting, and the place of the bone in the neighbourhood is taken by fibrous tissue. The articular surfaces on the back of the inner condyle and the inner tuberosity of the tibia are comparatively unchanged, but the articular surface of the outer tuberosity of the tibia is represented partly by a large necrosed fragment, and partly by fibrous tissue.

Tubercular Arthritis with Developing- Anchylosis. —Bones forming a right knee-joint—partially macerated and in spirit. The bone has apparently been accidentally broken in the process of preparation, and the broken pieces are held together by threads. The bones have been fixed in the flexed position. The interior of both femur and tibia has been greatly absorbed, and the bone has been soft and fatty. The patella is united, apparently by bone, to the front of the articular surface of the outer condyle, and the inner condyle and inner tuberosity of the tibia are united partly by bone and partly by fibrous tissue. The inner condyle and inner tuberosity of the tibia are not in contact. qDiseases of Joints. 458 7. 81.

The specimen shows numerous scars on the skin, the result of previous abscesses, also partial dislocation of the tibia backwards, as well as development of fat in the bones and of fibrous tissue round the joint. The anchylosis is fibrous and osseous between the femur and tibia, and fibrous between the patella and the femur. G. C. 3144. Presented by Macdonald Brown, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 82. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Outer half of the previous knee-joint—macerated, illustrating the above. The front of the outer articular surface of the tibia articulates with the back of the outer condyle. The upper part of the shaft of the tibia has had a slight concavity looking forwards. The femur and tibia are seen to be anchylosed, partly by bone, but apparently mainly by fibrous tissue. The cancellous texture of the femur, tibia, and fibula is opened out into large spaces, and the trabecular are delicate and thin. G. C. 3145. Presented by Macdonald Brown, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 83.

The inferior aspect of the condylar surfaces is flattened, and the articular surface is rarefied, remains of cartilage being only seen at the back. The patella has been partially anchylosed to the trochlear surface of the femur. No new bone has been thrown out round the femur, and its texture is lightened and greasy. G. C. 373. 7. 84. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Lower end of a left femur, upper half of tibia and patella — macerated, showing partial anchylosis and unusual distortion.Anchylosis after Tuberculosis of Knee. 45 The knee-joint has been fixed at a right angle. The patella is anchylosed to the front of the outer condyle, the back of which is sunk into and partially anchylosed to the outer tuberosity of the tibia. The inner condyle is separated from the inner tuberosity by about half an inch. No new periosteal bone has been formed. The substance of the bones is very greasy. Sir Charles Bell states that "this kind of distortion is owing to the patient's twisting his leg round the crutch." B. C. ii. M. 28. 7. 85. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Bones of a left knee-joint—macerated, and showing anchylosis in the flexed position. Tbe patella, which is anchylosed to the under surface of the outer condyle, has had an imperfect false joint between its lower edge and the front of the inner tuberosity of the tibia. The back of the inner condyle of the femur is adherent to the inner tuberosity of the tibia, the line of junction being irregular, and having been formed chiefly of fibrous tissue, now for the most part macerated away. The outer condyle of the femur has not been in contact with the corresponding tuberosity of the tibia, which, however, has been greatly absorbed. The tibia has been pulled backwards and rotated out- wards upon its inner tuberosity, so that the outer tuberosity is proportionately more dislocated than the inner. The bones are light and greasy. Active disease seems to have entirely ceased. G. C. 1003. 7. 86. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Bones of a left knee-joint—macerated, showing anchylosis in the flexed position and distortion.

The back of each condyle has been anchylosed to the corresponding tuberosity of the tibia; but the tibia is partially dislocated backwards and rotated outwards. In this specimen, however, the rotation has chiefly occurred by the bending outwards of the shaft of the femur, just above the condyles, possibly from twisting round a crutch. The bones are light and greasy. F. P. C. 817. Presented by Professor James Russell. 7. 87. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Bones of a left knee-joint—macerated, illustrating the above. The joint has been in the semi-flexed position. The patella is united by bone to the lower part of the outer condyle. The inner condyle is also firmly united by bone to the inner tuberosity of the tibia, while the back of the outer condyle has been anchylosed by fibrous tissue to the front of the outer tuberosity of the tibia. The tibia has been dislocated back- wards and rotated outwards upon the articulation between the inner tuberosity and the inner condyle. The bones are better developed and less greasy than in the three foregoing specimens. W. C. H. 47. 7. 88. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Bones of a left knee-joint—macerated, illustrating the above. The joint has been only slightly flexed. The patella is united by bone to the outer condyle. The inner condyle is united by bone to the inner tuberosity. In this, as in the previous specimen, the tibia is dislocated backwards and rotated outwards round the inner part of the articulation. There is a tendency of the femur and tibia to be curved backwards above and below the joint, thus partially undoing the flexion there. The bones are light and greasy. F. P. C. S16.

The specimen shows, however, that the soft parts rather than the bone have been involved by the return of tuberculosis. The ends of the bones are fatty, but not tubercular. Two caseous centres may be seen behind the lower end of the femur. A line of fibrous tissue indicates the junction of the two bones. G. C. 3071. . Presented by A. G. Millee, F.B.C.S.E. 7. 91. Return of Tubercular Disease after Excision of the Knee.—Section of the knee-joint of a child after excision—in spirit, showing the position of a tubercular sinus. The child was aged 10.years, and the joint had been excised two years previously in another town for tubercular disease. The limb was amputated by Dr P. H. MacLaren, partly for the persistence of the discharge from a sinus, partly for the fibrous union, and partly for the deficient growth of the limb. There is a wide fibrous union between the bones. The epiphysis has been removed at the excision from both femur and tibia, thus accounting for the want of growth. A blue rodDiseases of Joints. 462 indicates the direction of the sinus which has evidently heen due to some tubercular synovial membrane left above the patella at the time of the excision. G.

The knee-joint was excised for tubercular disease, but owing to the persistence of discharging sinuses, amputation was performed. The destruction of part of the adjacent portions of the femur and tibia by tubercular granulations is well shown. The line of union is fibrous, and has been progressing well. G. C. 3299.

About two years before amputation, the child had suffered from tubercular knee-joint disease, for which erasion had been performed. The femur had afterwards been the seat of acute osteomyelitis, ending in necrosis, for which amputation became necessary. The section shows a large sequestrum of the shaft of the femur, surrounded by a very thick shell of new bone. The epiphysis of the femur is seen beneath the patella. It is separated from the shaft by a layer of fibrous tissue behind, and by a large gap in front, which communicated with the sequestrum. The original cavity of the knee-joint is now occupied by fibrous tissue. G. C. 3458. Presented by John Duncan, F.R.C.S.E. Sacro-iliac joint. 7. 96.

Synovitis, involving- the Bone.—Part of a left innominate bone and thigh bone—macerated, illustrating the above. From a patient who died of hip-joint disease. " The capsular ligament was much relaxed, the ligamentum teres was entirely destroyed, the cartilages much eroded, the acetabulum nearly filled with coagulable lymph, and the head of the femur dislodged." The articular surface of the acetabulum is rarefied and rougb, and the normal smooth layers which lie below the cartilage remains only in some places. On the upper and lateral parts of the head of the femur the bone is similarly rarefied, and also partially absorbed at the front. Above and behind the attachment of the ligamentum teres there is some eburnation of the surface, such as is seen in arthritis deformans. Round the acetabulum there has been a considerable deposit of new bone. A small deposit of new periosteal bone is seen on the under side of the neck of the femur. The eburnation on the head of the femur points to arthritis deformans, while the new growth round the acetabulum resembles that due to septic irritation; the rarefaction and "flakesof coagulable lymph "may have been tubercular. Possibly, therefore, arthritis deformans has been followed by tuberculosis, and this has led to an abscess, which, after bursting, has become 7. 99. Tubercular Synovitis, involving* the Acetabulum.

There is a large cavity in the neck and great trochanter, and it extends also into the head. The walls of the cavity are partly formed by fibrous tissue, but at the lower, and upper and inner ends there are remains of a caseous extension. At the latter place the disease has penetrated into the upper part of the head. The cartilaginous surface is apparently unchanged. This has probably been a case where the bone disease has led chiefly to external abscesses, with secondary and late implication of the joint. G- C. 2014. 7. 103. Tubercular Arthritis, chiefly involving the Aceta- bulum.—Bones forming the left hip-joint of a growing person —macerated, illustrating the above. The cavity of the acetabulum is enlarged, and in several places is perforated. Two portions of bone have been necrotic and in process of separation — one at the junction of the iliac and pubic, and the other, a larger piece, at the junction of the iliac and ischial portions of the acetabulum. The rest of the acetabular surface is rarefied and eroded where it is not perforated. The articular surface of the head of the femur is also rarefied and rough, and the texture of the neck is lightened.

Tubercular Synovitis involving the Articular Surface.—Portions of a left elbow-joint removed by excision —macerated, illustrating the above. When fresh, the articular surfaces were in many parts covered with pulpy gelatinous material. At other places, soft gelatinous material (granulation tissue) had spread between the bone and the cartilage, and was absorbing it from below. The cartilage, however, was not loose, as it still adhered to the gelatinous material. On the articular surface of the humerus, two hard white nodules of bone stood out from the surrounding granulations. At the outer side there was a cavity entirely filled with gray gelatinous material, becoming caseous at various points. The articular surface of the ulna presented a similar appearance. The articular surfaces are rarefied, and show the deep holes which were filled with the gelatinous granulation material.Diseases of Joints. 478 On the front of the humerus, the two small portions of necrotic bone are seen, partially separated by the surrounding granulations.

The disease was of many years standing, and the limb was am- putated by Professor Ballingall by the double flap method. The patient was dismissed within a fortnight, with the wound healed by first intention. The articular surface of the humerus is rarefied and eroded at places. The articular surface of the ulna is rarefied and irregular, being excavated in many places. Tbe changes, how- ever, are most advanced in the radius. The interior of the head of that bone is for the most part absorbed. Tbe upper articular surface has necrosed, and, although still in position, is separate from the surrounding bone. These changes seem to be advanced stages of those seen in previous specimens. G- C. 905. b. Changes primarily or chiefly in the Bone. 7. 138.

About three years before his admission to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, he had sprained his right arm, and it had never been quite the same again. Some months before his admission, a swelling had appeared just below the front of the right elbow, and had gradually increased, till it burst and dis- charged. On admission, there was still swelling there, and an open sore with tough white sloughs lying in its centre. After poultices and blisters, the sloughs separated and the sore closed, but about the same time a chronic swelling appeared at the back of the elbow, and after being opened, turned septic. As the patient's health began to suffer, amputation was performed, and he made a good recovery. The section of the arm shows a mass of cicatricial tissue in the site of the former swelling on the front of the arm. It is not connected with the joint. The cartilage of the elbow joint is almost entirely replaced by granulations. A caseous cavity, which opened into the elbow-joint, is seen on the ulna, and non-vascular deposits between this cavity and the joint. G. C. 2810. Presented by P. H. MacLaeen, F.R.C.S.E. 139. Tubercular Arthritis, with Destruction of the Articular Surface of the Humerus. — Bones of a left elbow—macerated, illustrating the above. The central portion of the lower articular surface of the humerus is wanting, and the bone round it is greatly opened out, as if in process of absorption. A portion of the smooth articular surface of the capitellum remains, but on what is left of the trochlear surface the bone is rarefied. Corresponding- changes are present on the articular surfaces of the ulna and radius. Some new periosteal bone has been formed on all the bones near their articular surfaces. There has evidently been a septic complication in the later stages of the disease, but that the primary mischief was in the bone is only a conjecture based upon the comparatively localised destruction of the bone.

" From a boy, aged 8, who had received a slight injury on the elbow. He got into the hands of an ignorant person, calling himself a bone-setter. The violence which this person at repeated intervals used, in order to reduce a supposed dislocation of the joint, no doubt gave rise to the scrofulous caries in the bone, and which is finely displayed in this pre- paration." The upper end of the ulna is much enlarged by new growth on the surface, and a piece of bone, forming apparently the original articular surface, has necrosed, and has been in process of separation, for the adjoining bone is separated from it by a groove. The upper end of the radius is slightly enlarged by new bone growth on the surface, and the epiphysis has disappeared. The humerus is likewise enlarged above the articular end by new periosteal bone formation. The epiphysis on the radial side alone remains. G. C. 735.

The upper end of the ulna is greatly enlarged, while that of the radius is less so. The lower portion of the shaft of both bones is greatly atrophied. The lower end of the humerus is enlarged, but the most noteworthy change is the absorption on the inner side, so that the ulna is displaced upwards. The two necrotic fragments at the lower end of the humerus are apparently the remains of its lower epiphyses.

This specimen is from the same arm as jSTo. 7.137, which see for full history. The preparation consists of a longitudinal section through the radius, ulna, and first row of carpal bones, and a transverse section through the second row of carpal bones. He had noticed his wrist enlarged for some months, but never had any pain in it. He could move it freely, and complained only of the disfiguration from the swelling. Non-vascular areas like that in the radius are seen in various stages of progress in the carpal bones. There are also caseous masses within the joints, especially between the radius scaphoid, and in the lower radio-ulnar joint, which is distended with them. In many places the articular cartilage is entirely removed. The well-authenticated absence of pain on movement is there- fore remarkable, but it may possibly be explained by the non-vascular caseous condition of the bone below the eroded cartilage. G.

The bones, as now macerated and put up, show the extent of the disease. The phalanges of the fingers were even altered in structure, being so soft as to admit of a delicate soft wire being thrust through them in all directions."

The hip-joint has been fixed in a strongly adducted position. The margin of the acetabulum is deepened, and has grown inwards so as to envelop the head of the femur. A slight range of movement is possible between the femur and the acetabulum, but it is doubtful whether this existed before maceration. There is a small semi-detached scale of bone, with a depression near it in the cavity of the ilium, the nature of which is obscure.492 Diseases of Joints.

"This disease took place eight years before the patient's death, but with what symptoms I could not learn. He had acquired, however, by throwing back the pelvis, the power of walking, although the anchylosis had formed in the complete bent state of the joint. There is still a cartilaginous crust between the bones ; but very little alteration in the form of either bone has taken place, nor has the anchylosis been attended with much adhesive ossific inflammation." "Presented to me" (Mr G. Wilson) " by Mr Daw, house-surgeon to St. George's Hospital" (1808). The lower side of the neck of the bone, near the head, is enlarged, and there is also some enlargement of the head itself within the acetabulum, as well as of the margins of the aceta- bulum. These alterations remind one of the changes in arthritis deformans. Possibly the patient with the disease advancing had been confined to bed, and had kept the knee flexed for some time, after which it would perhaps be impossible to straighten it. W. C. H. 59. 7. 173.

The capsular ligament was much relaxed, and much coagulable lymph was thrown out in the cellular membrane round it. The ligamentum teres was entirely destroyed. The cartilaginous surfaces of both bones were much eroded. The acetabulum was nearly filled up with coagulable lymph. The head of the femur was dislodged from this cavity, and placed on the upper and posterior of it. The head of the bone has, from ulceration, become less, and the size of the cavity greater from the same cause. Some deposition of fresh bony matter has taken place in the innominatum in the neighbour- hood of the acetabulum. (This preparation, and the history of the case, I had from Mr Brodie, 1807.) " The head of the bone is enlarged at its circumference by- new bone, which is also present on the neck in front. At the same time the upper and inner part of the head has been absorbed, but the surface of the remaining bone, though some- what porous, is eburnated. The rest of the head of the bone, especially on the front, is rarefied and irregular. Some new bone has been thrown out at the attachment of the gluteus maximus, on the small trochanter and along the spiral line. The alterations in the cavity of the acetabulum correspond to those of the femur; the usual gap at the bottom is filled up with rough and porous bone, and the articular surface at the upper part is eburnated. The cavity of the acetabulum is shallow, but the margin of the bone is irregularly prolonged, especially at the upper part. The above appearances are typical of "arthritis deformans." W.

While there has been enlargement round the margin of the head of the femur, especially in front, there has been great absorption of the upper part, which thus is now below the level of the top of the great trochanter. This upper surface is fairly smooth, but has little or no eburnation, probably because locking prevented movement. The rest of the articular surface is irregular. The small trochanter has been partly absorbed. This specimen was formerly described as a united fracture of the neck of the femur. F. p- & 95- 177. Symmetrical Alterations in the Head and Neck of Femora, probably from Arthritis Deformans.—Upper portions of a right and left femur, with a vertical section of the head and neck of the left—macerated, illustrating the above. " The man, aged 50, had had several attacks of acute rheumatism. On admission to the hospital, he complained of a gnawing pain in the hip and shoulder-joints, and the motions of the hip-joint were considerably impaired. He died from exhaustion from a large lumbar abscess. He had been a shoemaker." » The shaft and trochanters were unaffected, but the neck was extremely short, and the head flattened and expanded. The acetabula were correspondingly large, shallow, and irregular. Instead of being an inch higher than the trochanter major, the highest part of the head was three-quarters of an inch lower than the trochanter. The neck was only half an inch in length, and was planted lower down on the bone, especially near the great trochanter. The margin was extended so as to form an overhanging ledge below, behind, and before. The outline of the head was flat below and arched above,Arthritis Deformans of Sip-joint. 495 7. 179.

The absorption of the top of the heads, the irregularity of the articular surfaces, and the prolongation of their margins are changes found in arthritis deformans. The shape of the altered head is not quite characteristic, hut a constant cross- legged position at his work might perhaps account for the peculiarity in this case. The symmetry is remarkable. G.

Advanced Arthritis Deformans of the Hip-joint, with Enlargement, Absorption, and Locking-.—Bones forming a left hip-joint—macerated, illustrating the above. There has been so much enlargement round the lower part of the articular margin of the femur, and so much absorption of the upper part of the head, that the tissue of the head seems as if it had been moulded roughly downwards, while the great trochanter has been proportionately raised. The new bone at the articular margin is very craggy and irregular, and the portion of bone which was in contact with the acetabulum is porous, and but very slightly eburnated, probably because the irregularity of the surfaces locked the joint, and permitted none but a very slight movement. The anchylosis has been in the flexed position. The acetabulum is enlarged round the margin, and the interior is rough and porous, with only a very slight degree of eburnation here and there. The muscular attachments on the ischium are rough. G. C. 2775. Presented by Macdonald Brown, F.R.C.S.E.Diseases of Joints. 496 vertical transverse section of a left femur and adjacent part of pelvis—macerated, illustrating the above. The limb has evidently been fixed in a strongly adducted position, for the lesser trochanter has been atrophied by pressure against the lower part of the acetabulum. This is evident when the bones are placed in situ. They have, however, been mounted separately, to show the condition of the articular surfaces. There is some enlargement round the head of the bone, and considerable absorption on its top and inner sides. The surfaces of the femur and acetabulum which were in close contact are very porous, and have little or no eburnation, pro- bably because only limited movement was permitted by the altered shape of the bones. There is considerable roughening at the point of attachment of the quadratus femoris to the femur. The acetabulum shows the usual irregular enlargement round the margin, with a facette at the front of the cotyloid notch, where it was pressed upon by the lesser trochanter. The section shows some condensation of the head and neck of the femur, with a small cavity near the articular margin above. G. C. 921 a. Presented by Adam Huntek, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 180. Advanced Arthritis Deformans.—Anterior half of the vertical transverse section of the previous specimen—in spirit. It will be noted that there is a distinct thick layer of cartilage on what, in the macerated specimen, seems to be an enlargement downwards of the head. The presence of cartilage upon this piece of bone, so far removed in position from that of any part of the original head, can only be accounted for in one or other of two ways. Either this is a new layer of cartilage which has formed upon new bone, or it is some of the original cartilage adhering to a portion of the original head of the bone, which has been displaced bodily downwards. As articular cartilage is seldom,Arthritis Deformans and Fracture of Hip. 497 if ever, formed anew, far less in this disease where it is largely absorbed, the alternative of downward displacement of the bone seems inevitable. q q 921 J. 181. Arthritis Deformans, following Fracture of the Neck Of the Femur.—Upper end of a right femur and acetabulum—macerated, illustrating the above. " The man was aged about 60 years. Ten years previous to his death the patient slipped his foot upon a stone, but did not fall. Next day he felt swelling in his groin, and became lame ever after. A new joint had been formed. The capsular ligament was thickened, and its cavity was much increased in size. The parts had become curiously adapted to each other by absorption and new deposition of bone, so as to admit of some use of the limb." The head and neck of the femur are entirely wanting, and the surface of the bone where the neck was attached is now quite smoothed over, there being only some irregularity round its margin. The acetabulum is greatly altered. A new surface has been hollowed out at its upper and back part by friction, evidently against the femur at the side of the neck. The remains of the original acetabulum shows irregularity of the former cartilaginous srrrface, with enlargement round about. Apparently there had been an intra-capsular fracture of the neck, with an after absorption of the ununited head. G. C. 1479. Presented by Professor J. W. Turner and A. Watson, Esq. 182. Arthritis Deformans, following- Fracture of the Neck of the Femur.—Upper end of a right femur with the innominate bone—macerated, illustrating the above. This specimen was originally entered as a fracture in which union of the fibro-cartilage had taken place. There is considerable irregularity all over the innominate bone and femur, especially at the muscular attachments. The acetabulum is filled in, but this on examination of the section proves to be due to an anchylosis of the head of the femur within the acetabulum. On the other hand, the head498 Diseases of Joints. •and neck of the femur are wanting at their normal place, and ;a flat surface on the femur indicates where the neck should have joined it. The outer surface of the bone which fills the acetabulum has evidently rubbed against the site of the neck, for although the opposite surfaces are for the most part porous, they each have patches of eburnation. There are no appearances at the line of junction of the head and acetabulum which would indicate anchylosis from arthritis deformans before the fracture.

The following is Dr Knox's description of the specimen :— "Altered condition of that portion of the tendon of the biceps flexor cubiti which passes into the shoulder-joint. On the cavity of the joint being exposed, the donor remarked that the tendon passing through the joint did not follow the usualDiseases of Joints. 500 course. It adhered along its whole course to the internal surface of the capsule, and was indeed reduced to a few fibrous and cellular-looking threads, which could he traced with diffi- culty. The tendon of the biceps as high as its passage into the groove of the humerus, and as high as that point where the synovial capsule is reflected upon it from off the fibrous capsular ligament could be readily traced; but here the tendon disappeared; a few of its fibres, assuming a cellular appearance, adhered to the margins of the groove in the bone, and a certain nuniher might also be traced from the termination of the groove closely adhering to the synovial membrane, and almost identified with it, as far as the usual insertion of this tendon into the upper portion of the fibro-cartilaginous ring of the- glenoid cavity. Since the occurrence of this case the donor has met with three others, closely resembling each other. (See a paper on the subject in the London Medical Gazette, No. 14, Saturday, March 8, 1828.) E. Stanley, Esq., in the same periodical for December 6, 1828, states that he has since remarked three similar cases. He seems to he of opinion, and gives some interesting cases to show, that the tendon of the biceps can be ruptured hy certain forcible movements of the arm, without being accompanied with the dislocation of the humerus. The symptoms are severe, and the time required for the reparation of the injury much more considerable than in the case of a common bruise. Mr Stanley further states that in two cases of dislocation of the humerus, which he had an opportunity of examining, he found the tendon of the biceps entire." It is now known, as the previous four specimens illustrate, that these are not cases of rupture of the biceps tendon, but of its absorption in the progress of arthritis deformans. The central portion of cartilage on the head of the humerus is worn away, and round the margin there is some enlargement and irregular outgrowth of bone. There is some irregularity of the cartilage at the lower part of the glenoid cavity. G. C. 1121. Presented by K. Knox, F.R.C.S.E.Arthritis Deformans of Shoulder-joint. 501 7. 188. Advanced Arthritis Deformans, with Alteration of the Articular Surfaces.—Right humerus and scapula of an elderly person—macerated, illustrating the above. The articular surfaces are both flattened out, and the globular character of the head of the humerus has been quite lost. Round the articular margins of both bones there are numerous irregular outgrowths of bone. The bicipital groove is lost, there being only a shallow depression at the upper end to mark its former site. The shaft of the humerus is curved outwards at the attachment of the deltoid. The upper part of the greater tuberosity has been in contact with the acromion process, and the bony outgrowths on the glenoid cavity reach to the top of the coracoid process, There is little or no alteration on the lower articular surface of the humerus. There must have been considerable shortening of this arm. These appearances of the shoulder-joint are such as might have been artificially produced had the bones been softened to a putty-like consistence and then pressed together. G. C. 1193. a.

As in the previous preparation, the head and glenoid cavities have apparently been compressed and flattened against one another, and irregular masses of new bone formed round the articular surfaces fit more or less accurately into one another. The greater tuberosity, in this specimen also, reaches to the acromion process, and the upper part of the shaft of the humerus is very much altered. There is much irregular thickening at the level of the attachment of the deltoid, and at the lower part of the usual position of the bicipital groove there is an aperture leading into the bone which communicates inter- nally with the lower edge of the altered articular surface. ThereDiseases of Joints. 502 Presented by Professor James Russell. is also a smaller aperture with a blind extremity a little- below the first one. The remains of the bicipital groove is seen between the upper parts of the altered tuberosities. The glenoid cavity is flattened and enlarged by growth of bone at the margins. The lower portion of the surface is rarefied. At the lower end of the bone there is considerable prominence of the muscular attachments and some irregularity of the cartilage on the capitellum. "W. C. H. 39. 7. 190. Advanced Arthritis Deformans, with great Atrophy of the Humerus.—Left humerus and scapula- macerated, to illustrate the above. The shaft of the humerus from the attachment of th& deltoid upwards is curved outwards, and is flattened from within outwards, i.e. the reverse direction to the flattening in a rickety curve. (There is, however, one ridge in this concavity which partly corresponds to the usual development of bone in the con- cavity of the arch.) The outer lip of the bicipital groove is prominent below, but the inner lip can hardly be recognised anywhere. The head of the bone is wanting, having apparently been absorbed, and what represents the articular surface is irregular and at places eburnated. At the upper margin of what represents the head, there is an irregular projection of bone, as in the two previous specimens. The glenoid cavity of the scapula has been absorbed at its central parts and towards the- back, Avhile a thick ridge of bone has been thrown out all round the margins, especially above and below. The cavity thus deepened and enlarged resembles an imperfect acetabulum, The surface is irregular, being at places both porous and eburnated. When the bones are articulated, the upper part of the humerus, as in the previous specimen, comes close under- neath the acromion process. G.

The articular surface on the lower part of the capitellum is bared of cartilage and smooth. There is also some bony outgrowth at the margins of the trochlear surface.

There is considerable atrophy on the inner side of the . trochlea, and the articular surface has thus the appearance of being tilted up, so as to bring the inner side higher than the outer. The cartilage has been worn off the articular surfaces, and the trochlear surface, now covered by smooth bone, is marked by deep grooves. The head of the radius is greatly enlarged all round, while its cartilage is partially eroded. The coronoid and olecranon fossae are shallow, but a new depres- sion has been formed above the capitellum for the enlarged head of the radius. The articular margins of the humerus and ulna are enlarged, and one adimentary bone is seen on the coronoid process of the ulna, and another on the back of the trochlear surface. G. C. 3246.

The joint has been opened, and the humerus rotated504 Diseases of Joints. upwards from its articulation with the bones of the forearm, so as to display the articular surfaces. The lower end of the humerus is so greatly atrophied that its original shape is not recognisable. The whole of the outer condyle, with some of the bone above it, is now wanting. Large adimentary bones have formed in the synovial membrane. There is a large one above the olecranon process, another at the inner condyle of the humerus, and other smaller ones are scattered round the joint. The articular surfaces of the joint show smooth exposed bone at some places. At others they are covered with a shreddy, fibrous material, but nowhere with cartilage. The synovial mem- brane, where it has been left, shows numerous processes —some pendulous and thick, and others fine and shreddy. This specimen was formerly described as one of fracture and dislocation, involving the elbow-joint, not, however, from a history of the case, but from an interpretation of the appear- ances. The view now taken, however, seems the more correct one, as the specimen quite corresponds with an extreme degree of the changes seen in other examples of arthritis deformans. G. C. 784.

There has been firm anchylosis of the elbow. The lower end of the humerus is enlarged, and the ulna even more so, and the irregularities have interlocked. Fibrous tissue intervenes between the articular surfaces at most places. What was formerly the capitellum is now an irregular hollow on the outer side of the humerus, with a margin of new bone round it. The head of the radius is greatly enlarged, and has the appearance of having been shifted bodily outwards. Its articular surface, like that of the humerus, is smooth and eburnated, while round about it shows the usual irregularity. The broken ends of the ulna are surrounded by a capsule, and there is the cavity of a false joint between them. A quantity of fibrous tissue at the back unites the fragments to one another and to the adjacent part of the radius. q q 3069 Presented by William Kussell, M.D. 196.

Lower down on the ulna is seen a small hollow facet, which has evidently also been for the radius at the tubercle. Judging from the position of the anterior ridge of the ulna, the bones of the forearm have been fixed in pronation. The alternatives in deciding as to the nature of this con- dition lay between the above and a congenital malformation which indeed it in many ways resembles. B. C. 2. M. 51.

The upper end of the fibula is bent out- wards from the tibia, and there is a space between it and the tibia, which has evidently been occupied by a mass of the tumour. Plates of new bone appear to grow from the fibula at the front of the head, but it is more probable that they are part of the original tibial tumour here pressed against the fibula, and dried in situ.

A curve to the left in the upper dorsal region has its maximum about the third vertebra, and one to the right in the lower dorsal region has its maximum about the tenth vertebra. Apparently there has been another curve to the left in the lumbar region. There is a slight rotation of the vertebras towards the convexity, with corresponding changes in the ribs, as noted in the previous specimens. The first rib is not as much elevated as might have been expected. This may have been due to faulty mounting. B. C. 1. 3. M. 15. 7. 214.

There are also compensating curves to the right in the upper dorsal and lumbar regions respectively. The rotation of the bodies of the vertebras towards the convexity is well shown, and in the main curve to the left the corresponding changes in the ribs are also well marked. Thus there is a projection of the angles backwards at the convexities, i.e. below on the left and above on the right; and a flattening of the angles at the concave portions, i.e. below on the right and above on the left. It should be noted, however, that the ribs at the convexity or left side below are not separated, but are rather thrown together. This may be due to the effect of the pressure of the ribs from above.

Advanced Lateral Curvature of the Spine.—Spinal column, from third cervical vertebra downwards, with pelvis —partly macerated, illustrating the above. There is a series of alternating lateral curves, i.e. to the left in the upper dorsal and in the lumbar region, and to the right in the mid-dorsal and in the cervical region. The spine, as a whole, is bent forwards, and the normal curves are as usual diminished. The usual rotation of the bodies towards the con- vexity is best seen in the strong curve to the right in the mid- dorsal region. A development of bone at the inter-vertebral borders from arthritis deformans is well seen on the left side of the eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth dorsal, and first lumbal' vertebras ; and on the right side of the second and third lumbal' vertebras.

The spine, as a whole, is bent forward. The head has probably been thrust to the left. There is a marked curve to the right extending over the cervical and dorsal regions, with its maximum convexity at the sixth dorsal vertebra. Slight com- pensating curves to the left are present in the cervical and lower dorsal regions respectively. The vertebras in the main curve are rotated towards the convexity as usual. The angles of the ribs on the right side are consequently projected backwards, and those on the concave or left side are flattened ; but the upper- most and lowermost ribs on each side are altered in the reverse way to those about the middle of their own side in accord- ance with the compensating curves. The ribs on the concave or left side are compressed, especially about the middle, while those on the right side, although closely approximated at their angles, are elsewhere widely separated. W. C.

Advanced Lateral Curvature.—Spinal column, with the pelvis, portions of ribs, and part of skull attached—partly macerated, illustrating the above. The specimen shows in a marked degree alternating lateral curves, with loss of the. usual anteroposterior curves. There is a strong curve to the left in the lumbar region, another to the right in the mid-dorsal, and a third slight one to the left in the upper dorsal region. There is the usual rotation of the bodies of the vertebra towards the convexity, with corresponding alterations in the ribs, i.e. a projection backwards of the angles on the right side in the mid-dorsal region, and to the left side in the upper dorsal region, with flattening of the angles of the opposite ribs in each case. Owing to the obliquity of the bodies of the vertebra, the projecting angle of the fifth rib on the right side is opposite the slightly projecting angle of the fourth rib on the left side, but examination will show the real relation of the ribs. As is usual in such cases, the articular and transverse processes, as well as the heads of the ribs, are compressed in the concavity of the curve, and the articular processes and lamina in many515 Lateral Curvature of the Spine. places are partially anchylosed.

Advanced Lateral Curvature of the Spine.— Dorsal and lumbar portion of the spine with pelvis—partly macerated, illustrating the above. A section was originally made of the preparation, but as the bone was found to be friable, it was considered best to replace the parts. There is a very extreme curve to the right in the mid- dorsal region, possibly due to tilting of the pelvis. The usual rotation of the bodies of the vertebra? to the convex side, with compression and anchylosis of parts iu the concavity, is well seen. The natural curves are obliterated. The pelvis is roomy and fairly natural, except that the iliac crests are flattened. 33. C. r. 3. M. 11 and 12. 7.219. Advanced Lateral Curvature, with Excessive Distortion.—Spinal column, thorax, and pelvis—macerated, illustrating the above. The patient, a man who lived to nearly the age of 50, died of apoplexy. There is an extremely acute lateral curve to the left in the lower dorsal region, with a compensating curve to the right in the upper dorsal region. The rotation of the vertebral bodies is so complete in the lower dorsal region that the front of some of them looks obliquely backwards. The usual increased projection of the angles of the ribs at the convexity, and flattening at the concavity, is so marked that the lower ribs on the left side are like flattened plates rolled round the bodies of the vertebra; while on the right side, they are nearly straight. The compressed parts in the concavity are in many cases anchylosed. Figured by Shaw « on Distortion," plate 4. 33. C. i. 3. M. 17. 7. 220.

The vertebrse have evidently been portions of a lateral curve with its convexity to the right, and show advanced changes in the bone. At the concavity the bodies are greatly compressed, and the upper two have lost more than half their vertical diameter. The intervertebral space is narrowed. The articular processes and laminae are compressed and firmly anchy- losed together, and the adjacent parts are atrophied. It is interesting to notice that the pedicles have diminished in size along with the other parts, although the nerves on the inter- vertebral foramina must have fended off direct bony pressure from them. Possibly the pressure upon the articular processes at one end, and upon the bodies at the other end of the- pedicles, may have led to atrophy of the intervening pedicles- themselves.

An abscess is shown on the right side, with its walls laid •open. It was found on dissection to communicate by narrow •passages with the caseating centres in the lumbar vertebrae. This specimen teaches the following important points :— ((1) That centres of caseation may exist, and give rise to .abscesses, without any displacement of the vertebrae; (2) that the communication between such centres and an abscess cavity or cavities may be very small and tortuous, and inaccessible from any wound that could be made during life; (3) that •there may be separate centres of tuberculosis in the spinal column, causing displacement at one place and an abscess at another, and that the different centres need not in any way •communicate; and (4) that the different centres may be in different phases of advance or subsidence.

The second and third lumbar vertebra? are comparatively unchanged, but upon the right side and hack of the fourth lumbar vertebra the bone is rarefied and absorbed. Whatever may have been the state of the column above the eleventh dorsal vertebra, the part below it shows a con- dition similar to that seen in the last specimen, namely,, separate seats of tubercular disease, which have as yet not led to much absorption or alteration in the spinal column as a whole.

The following is Sir Charles Bell's description :— " This is a specimen of the diseased state of the vertebra?, which precedes the destruction of their bodies, and the con- sequent yielding to the superincumbent weight. There was, in this case, paralysis of the legs, probably in consequence of inflammation of the bone attacking the spinal marrow; as there is here no compression of the spinal marrow to account for the paralysis, on mechanical principles, we must suppose it is the- influence of the contiguous inflammation, and not the curvature of the spine and pressure of the spinal marrow, which produces- paralysis." It is now recognised, as succeeding specimens will show, that paralysis in "Potts' Curvature" is very often, if not invariably, caused by mechanical pressure upon the cord or nerves. B. C. 1. 3.

There was no spinal curvature, nor any history of definite pain, pointing to spinal disease, but by exclusion this was considered the most probable cause or* the abscess. Owing to the woman's weak state of health, any operation was postponed, and she meanwhile died of rapidly advancing phthisis. At the post-mortem examination an abscess was found running along the iliac fascia to the spine, and extending also under the thigh in a line with the psoas muscle. The intervertebral disc between the last two lumbar vertebrae has been destroyed. The front of the last vertebra is eroded, while some nodules of new bone have been formed on the left side of the fourth vertebra. G. C. 3452. Presented by Charles "W.

The intervertebral cartilages were found softened, and the ligaments loose and spongy, as if macerated by the pus which was round the diseased part. The bodies of the vertebrae have partly been consumed, and one vertebra is seen to be sinking down, and, as it were, dove-tailing itself into the one below. There are numerous spots of rarefaction on the sides of the bodies, and some form apertures, showing necrotic bone within. Some of the ribs on the left side were " diseased a similar way." B.

The inner aspect of the left lateral mass at the attachment of the transverse ligament is also somewhat rarefied, and the body of the axis and its odontoid process have been dis- eased, and the substance is light and opened out. The cause of death is unknown, but this is one of those cases in which there is great danger of a falling forward of the head. This causes death by drawing the medulla against the odontoid process. G. C. 823. Presented by Sir Georce Ballingall. 7. 228. Tubercular Disease, with Destruction of Bone — Upper four cervical vertebrae—macerated, illustrating the above. The patient, a girl aged sixteen years, had been affected with extensive abscesses in the neck. " She died suddenly after being attacked with difficult breathing and symptoms resembling the common catarrhal fever." The lateral masses and posterior arch of the atlas are rarefied and partially absorbed, and similar changes are seen in the body, odontoid, and upper articular processes and left half of the ring of the axis, as well as slightly on portions of the third vertebra. In all probability death has been caused by the pressure of tubercular ddbris upon the medulla oblongata. G. C. 1075. Presented by Adam Hunter, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 229. Tubercular Disease, with Destruction of Bone.— First five cervical vertebrae—macerated, illustrating the above. The greater part of the body of the axis has been destroyed, leaving only a bridge of bone, thinner on the left side, between the odontoid process and the lateral masses. There has been some new bone formation on the other vertebras, and more or less anchylosis has taken place between the second, third, fourth, and fifth vertebras. The axis has settled down in front upon the third vertebra, so that the head must have projectedTubercular Disease of the Spine. 521 forward, and the spine of the axis been rendered prominent. This has probably been a case where an abscess connected with the axis has been opened, and turned septic, and having dis- charged for some time before death, has led by its irritation to the new bone formation.

Caseous-looking material occupies the intervals between the pedicles, and has formed a thick layer on the outer surface of the dura mater. This condition is not very common. When such an accumulation increases, it may cause paralysis by pressure upon the spinal cord. It then constitutes the form of "pressure paralysis " in Potts' Disease, which is most amenable to surgical interference. G. C. 3503. 7. 231. Tubercular Disease—Destruction of Bodies—Para- plegia.—Upper three dorsal and lower six cervical vertebras of a child—macerated, illustrating the above. "Isabella Rennie, aged ten, died 30th November 1831. She was considered a healthy child till about two years before, when she began to have glandular swellings in different parts of the body. In March a small swelling appeared in the upper part of her back. This gradually enlarged, and at the same time her power of moving her legs diminished. At length she lost this power entirely, and also the sensibility of the whole lower part of the body. She had, however, occasional attacks of convulsions in the legs, which caused much pain. She could not retain her urine, but her bowels had always to be assisted by purgations. She gradually declined in health, was subject to violent catarrhal attacks, and gangrene of the hip from pressure became very deep and extensive. The exterior surface of the joint was thus laid bare.Diseases of Joints, 522 On dissection, the body was found to be much emaciated. There was serum in both pleura, and in the pericardium, but the lungs were healthy. A tumour of the size of an egg projected from the spine into the left pleura. It consisted of a very soft sac, ('died with curd-like matter. On examining the spine more minutely, it appeared that the last cervical vertebra was slightly carious, and that the bodies of the three uppermost dorsal vertebra? had been almost wholly absorbed." Almost the whole of the bodies of the first two dorsal vertebra have disappeared. The debris of caseous material and bone— removed by maceration—has no doubt been pressed back upon the spinal cord by the weight of the head and neck. The right pedicle and lamina of the first dorsal vertebra have disappeared. Parts of the next two vertebrae on the same side are rarefied. Elsewhere the laminse, as well as the spines, do not seem to have been affected. Gr. C. 1288. Presented by William Brown, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 232. Tubercular Disease, with Destruction of Bodies,. Abscess, Paraplegia.— Left half of the lower cervical and upper dorsal vertebrae of a boy—in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient, aged 12 years, was admitted to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on 17th October 1892. He had been treated for disease of the spine, with jackets, etc., since the age of four. He was admitted on account of partial paralysis of motion and sensation of the lower limbs, occasional involuntary passage of urine, exaggerated knee-jerk and ankle clonus, but with no fever. There was a marked angular curvature in the- eervico-dorsal segment of the spine. Double extension was applied to the head and lower limbs for six weeks without improvement. In December 1892 Professor Annandale removed the lamina? and spines of the seventh cervical and first and second dorsal vertebra?. Pus in abundance, welled up between the dura and the canal, evidently coming from the situation of the bodies in front. The patient, however, died on the same night from respiratory embarrassment and shock. At the post-mortem examination firm adhesions were found at the right apex of the lung, but no tubercular or waxy disease of any of the organs. A large caseous abscess lay in front of the bodies, corresponding to the curvature. The diseased segment was removed, and after being frozen was sawn in sagittal mesial section. The specimen shows great destruction and absorption of the bodies of the lower cervical vertebrae, with a correspond-Tubercular Disease of the Spine. 523 ing falling forward of the upper parts of the canal, so as to drag the spinal cord against a projecting fragment of one of the lower vertebra?. This form of " pressure paralysis " due to spinal disease is not amenable to operative treatment unless indeed the upper part of the column could be replaced. It is sometimes, however, difficult, if not impossible, to recognise it before- hand. G. C. 3481. Presented by Professor T. Annandale, 1893. 7.233.

The bodies of the vertebras from the lower cervical to the tenth dorsal inclusive have been almost entirely destroyed. The spine has consequently been bent upon itself so much that the lower cervical vertebras must have been close down, upon the eleventh dorsal. The spinal canal has evidently been almost obliterated, and extensive paraplegia must have been the consequence. B. C. 1. 3. M. 57. 7.235.

The spine has thus been so bent upon itself that the head of the first rib is close to that of the sixth, and the bodies of the sixth cervical and sixth dorsal vertebrae nearly touch. The spine of the third dorsal vertebra is greatly atrophied, and there is a distinct space between its laminae and those of the vertebrae above and below it. Some of the articular processes seem to be anchylosed. This must have been a case of paraplegia, and probably also of abscess. G. C. 596. a. 7. 236.

Some of the debris of the affected vertebrae seems to have been crushed backwards upon the spinal cord, and no doubt compressed it. The bodies of the adjacent vertebrae have been eroded on the surface, and opaque patches of caseation can be seen here and there in their interior, although there has not been much alteration of their general shape. Part of the wall of an abscess cavity is shown attached to the sides of all the bodies in the preparation.

The patient had suffered from spinal disease, with paraplegia, for some years, and died of phthisis in the Hospital for Incurables. At the post-mortem examination a large abscess was found surrounding the bodies of the affected vertebrae. This abscess contained, besides curdy pus, several loose fragments of hard necrosed bone, which had been driven back, by the pressure of the adjacent vertebrae, upon the spinal canal. These fragments, found at the post-mortem examination, are shown in situ, having been embedded in dark paraffin before the section was made, in order that their relative position might be maintained. It may be noted that the curvature, which corresponds to what existed at the time of deatb, is comparatively sb>ht. This is important as showing that a minor degree of curvature may co-exist with involvement of the spinal cord. G. C. 3475. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.K.C.S.E., 1893. 7. 239. Tuberculosis, with Destruction of Bodies—A trophy of Ribs and Spines, and Paraplegia.—Eight half of a spine representing the lower seven dorsal vertebrae (sixth to twelfth inclusive), with portions of the lower seven ribs attached. Soft parts partially dissected—in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient, a young man aged 20, about two years before ad- mission to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, first noticed a pain in the lower dorsal region of his spine, when he stooped or straightened his back. The pain was dull and aching, and extended along the ribs on the left side, which corresponded to the painful part of the spine. It gradually increased, and in about six months had become constant,526 Diseases of Joints. whether he was sitting or standing. A month later it had extended along the ribs on the right side. These symptoms gradually increased until December 1888, when he was admitted into the Infirmary. At that time he had no pain or weakness in his legs, and as soon as a Plaster-of-Paris jacket had been applied he returned home. The pain in his spine was not relieved, but that in his ribs disappeared. Soon, however, he felt a loss of sensation in his legs, beginning first in the left thigh, and extending to other parts of the lower limbs. About a month after the jacket had been applied, the pain in the back increased, and he had difficulty in walking. On January 10th, 1889, he returned to Mr Miller's ward, and was then able to walk into the waiting room with the aid of an umbrella. His legs were weak, and the pain in his back worse, and at his own request the jacket was removed, He made an effort to get up, hut found that he had entirely lost the power of his legs, and so had to be carried from the waiting room to the ward. After ten days he was taken to the Medical House. At that time a projection of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth dorsal spines was noted, and both lower limbs were completely paralysed. The plantar reflex was present on the left side, but not on the right. Ankle clonus was obtained on both sides, and also patellar reflex, but not exagger- ated. No cremasteric reflex was obtained, but the anterior abdominal and thoracic reflexes were lively. The patient could tell when his bladder was full, but had difficulty in starting micturition. His bowels sometimes moved without his knowledge. The muscles of the paralysed limbs were firm and not wasted. No trophic lesion was visible. There was a con- stant dull pain in his back near the prominence, with occasional sharp pains, followed by drawing up of his legs. The pain was sometimes felt when he moved his trunk. "When he coughed there were occasional sharp pains following the line of the ribs attached to the diseased portion of the spine. Over the eighth dorsal spine even a light pressure caused pain. There was no marked tenderness over the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth dorsal spines. The other systems were normal. On May 4th the sensation was perfect in both feet, and the area of insensitive skin less. He could flex his knees occasionally, and had better control over his rectum and bladder than formerly. The spine was trephined on May 31st by Mr Miller. After removing the soft parts, the tenth dorsal spine, which was softened and inflamed, was removed with bone pliers. The spinous process above it was next looked for, but was absent, and the corresponding lamina was atrophied to the thickness of ordinary letter paper, and could easily be broken with the finger nail. The dura mater was opened, and much cerebro- spinal fluid welled out. Excepting that the spinal cord was thinner and smaller than normal, nothing wrong was detected. The wound was then closed. Shortly after the operation, symptoms of spinal meningitis appeared, but by July 4th they were rapidly disappearing. It was noted on August 5th for the first time that at each in- spiration there was a sinking in of the wall of the chest near the affected part of the column. On palpation, the vertebral ends of the tenthTubercular Disease of the Spine. 527 and eleventh ribs were found wanting for a distance of from two inches to two and three-quarter inches from the middle line. At the same time, the patient could localise the touch of a finger or the point of a pin all over the back and lower extremities, being in this respect much better than before. On October 7th it was noted that the disappearance of the ribs was progressing. On October 11th Mr Miller cut down upon the affected ribs on the right side to discover the cause, if possible, of the atrophy. The ribs when traced, he observed, became suddenly rough and nodular, and smaller in bulk. Portions were removed, placed in absolute alcohol, and sent to Drs Woodhead and Bruce for examination. The wound turned septic, and on October 23rd secondary htemorrhage occurred, and despite all efforts to stop it, returned repeatedly, until the patient died on November 10th from exhaustion. The specimen shows many points of great interest. The lower part of the hody of the eighth, the whole of the ninth, and the upper part of that of the tenth dorsal vertebrae are wanting, and a bridge of new bone unites the eighth and tenth dorsal bodies in front, preventing the one from sinking down upon the other. The spinous processes seen in the preparation are those of the sixth, eighth, eleventh, and twelfth dorsal vertebras. The spinous process of the seventh vertebra has practically dis- appeared, so that the projection below the sixth is really the remains of the eighth spine. The ninth spine was wanting when the spine was trefined, and what remained of the tenth spine was then removed. The great part of the lamina of the tenth dorsal vertebra has also disappeared. The vertebral ends of the ninth and tenth ribs are also wanting. The intervertebral foramen for the eighth dorsal nerve has been displaced backwards, so that the nerve emerges below the lamina near the spine. The ninth nerve crosses the space in which no bone is present at all, and the tenth nerve comes through a small aperture in what seems to be the remains of the tenth lamina. The remains of the soft parts in the neighbourhood of the diseased portion are covered by recent lymph and discoloured blood-clot, the result of the abscess following the second opera- tion.Diseases of Joints. 528 The cause of the absorption of the lamina? is still obscure. A possible clue may be found in the pressure which must have been present at one time upon the intervertebral nerves. The portion examined by Dr. Woodhead was found to show no sign of tubercular disease. G. C. 3105. Presented by A. G. Millek, F.R.C.S.E., 1889. 7. 240.

Tubercular Disease, with great Destruction of the Bodies.—Left half of a spinal column, pelvis, and part of skull —partially cleaned and dried, illustrating the above. Margaret M'N., about thirty, was known by the inspector of poor for about ten years as a prostitute of the very lowest type. Some defor- mity was supposed to have been present since childhood, and she had gone about " doubled-up " certainly for ten years before death. She went into the workhouse in an exhausted condition, and died there from increase of the exhaustion, without symptom of any definite disease, probably the result of a debauched life and ill health. She was able, however, to "move about" until a month or two before her death. There had been a sinus discharging for some time, beside the projecting spines. On each side a chronic abscess was found extending about half-way to the groin, and filled with caseous material, becoming calcareous. The bodies of the vertebra? from the ninth dorsal to the second lumbar inclusive, as well as portions of those of the seventh and eighth dorsal and third lumbar, have disappeared. The corresponding spinous processes have been fused into a single piece, which has been accidentally broken after death. The dorsal spine above the disease has been curved forwards, i.e. with the convexity towards the thorax, and in consequence the ribs from the fourth to the tenth have been curved markedly upwards and forced together. There is considerable calcareous debris now in some parts of the canal, but this must have been loose during life, and probably has not pressed against the nerves. The narrowing of the outlet of the pelvis, and the tilting back of the promontory of the sacrum, are characteristic of Kyphosis. The absence of paraplegia is remarkable, and is probably to be explained by the gradual escape of the debris through the sinus and the slow formation of the curves. G.

The bodies from the third to the eighth vertebrae have been affected. The inter-vertebral foramina just at the bend have been obliterated by the pressure of debris into them. The laminae of the affected vertebrae are ossified together, and the fourth and fifth spinous processes and laminae are greatly atrophied. The coincidence of the blocking of the inter-vertebral foramina with the atrophy of the spinous process should be noted in connection with No. 7. 238; but whether there is any relation between them, as cause and effect is uncertain. W. C. H. 53. 248. Tubercular Disease in Process of Cure.—Eight half of the spinal column, thorax, and pelvis of a child—macerated, illustrating the above. There is an acute curvature in the lower dorsal region, and the lower six vertebrae are fused into a common wedge-shaped mass, with its apex projecting backwards. There are cavities in its interior. The spinous processes at the angle are somewhat atrophied, and thus the apparent acuteness of the curve is diminished. B. C. i. 3. M. 10. 249.

The specimen shows the effects of tubercular disease which involved the whole of the dorsal vertebra?, except the first and the last. The bodies have fallen together, and the lower eight affected ones are anchylosed into a wedge-shaped mass of cancellous tissue, with its apex projecting backwards. The upper two affected vertebra? are anchylosed to one another, but not to the lower mass. The spinal canal is diminished slightly at the bend, but less so than would at first appear, because the section just at the bend is not quite mesial. To compensate for the marked backward projection in the upper dorsal region, the normal forward curves in the cervical and lumbar regions are greatly increased, so that the head still remains over the pelvis and the face looks upwards. The ribs are, as usual, greatly compressed, and the cavity of the thorax diminished. The pelvis is kyphotic, and the bones generally are very light. W. C. H. 71. 7. 255.

The vertebra? affected are the last three dorsal and first three lumbar, which are now fused into an irregular mass. The spine is bent acutely forward in the upper dorsal regionr but the spinal canal has not been appreciably encroached upon, at least by bony matter. The portion of spine above the- disease, and what remains of it below the disease, has been curved with the convexity forwards, thus exaggerating the normal curves in the cervical and lumbar regions. By these- compensating curves the skull remains over the pelvis, and the face looks forwards. The ribs are greatly compressed, and the cavity of the thorax is diminished. The pelvis is kyphotic, and the angle between the neck of the femur and the shaft is very obtuse. B. C. I. 3. M. 64. and 65. 7. 256.

Sarcoma affecting* the Spine.—Section of the lumbar portion of the spine of a young person—in spirit, illustrating the above. William A., a weakly-looking boy, aged 10 years, was admitted to Ward 10 in December 1892 under the care of Mr Duncan, complaining of loss of power in both lower extremities. His lower limbs were almost entirely paralysed, but he could turn himself on to his face. Sensation in his legs was dulled, but not entirely lost; he could localise touches with the fingers, but could not say with how many fingers he was touched. A rounded swelling apparently connected with the bone could be felt over the head and upper part of the left fibula. There was a slight deformity of the spine in the lower dorsal and upper lumbar regions. Patient showed great tendency to the formation of bedsores, and required constant change of position. His feet became very cedematous, and large blebs formed on them, which were prevented from breaking by the application of wool and collodion. His prepuce was also very cedematous, and rendered the passage of a catheter difficult. The patient had been sent into the Infirmary as a case of Potts' disease. From the anomalous character of some of the symptoms, this diagnosis was considered doubtful, but a plaster jacket was applied, and he was kept in bed. Not long afterwards, however, the jacket had to be removed on account of a swelling of his abdomen. Towards the end of December he had retention of urine, and this was shortly followed by incontinence of both urine and feces. About the beginning of January a hard swelling appeared above the pubes, and rapidly increased in size. On 10th January there was ptosis of the left eyelid, and shortly after that ptosis of the right also,'with internal strabismus as well. The patient got gradually weaker, and died on 24th January, having suffered very little pain from first to last. At the post-mortem examination, within the thorax there was found a large tumour about the size of a hen's egg in the upper dorsal region, and also a "warty" tumour all along the right side of the vertebral column. A tumour was present on the posterior surface of the right lung.538 Diseases of Joints. There was a large growth in front of the pelvis reaching to one and a half inches from the umbilicus. The growth was chiefly on the left side, and had most likely proceeded from another tumour on the left iliac bone. The whole pelvis was a mass of soft tumour. The ureter on the left side was greatly dilated. The dura mater was extremely adherent to the skull cap. In the posterior part of the superior longitudinal sinus there was a small pale tumour. Also on the left side, near the middle line, there was another tumour under the dura mater. The convolutions were somewhat pale. Vessels at base of brain were normal. The brain substance was extremely anaemic, and somewhat cedematous. From the second to sixth dorsal vertebra the cord was decidedly thinner (sic). It was quite firm in its whole extent, except at the upper part of the lumbar enlargement. The section shows the tumour to be composed of soft material, arranged in lobulated portions of slightly different colour and consistence, which are separated by a very delicate connective tissue. The'part most affected is the periosteum. There is apparently neither ossification nor invasion of bone. It was not possible to say where the primary tumour ha(L been situated in this case.

On both sides a strong spur of bone about half an inch in diameter and about two inches long projects from the front of the symphysis pubis just below the crest, and follows the direction of the adductor longus muscle. On the right side the muscles have been dissected off, and the bone on this side has been separated from the pelvis by a fibrous intersection which has been wrenched open. The mode of union is thus seen to have been an irregular form of synchondrosis. On the left side the origins of the muscles have been left, and it can be seen that besides the adductor longus, the greater part of the adductor bxevis, and portions of the pectineus, the gracilis, and the obturator externus take origin from the new spur of bone.

Degeneration of Muscles of Arm.—Transverse section of a forearm—in spirit, illustrating the above. "The integuments were indurated and tuberculated from the middle of the arm to that of the forearm, and the elbow and muscles of the forearm rigid. The hand and lower part of the extremity were much swollen and cedematous. On the forearm was a considerable ulcer, with abrupt ragged edges and foul surface. "The arm was amputated close to the shoulder joint, where the parts appear sound, but after some months a similar disease attacked the cicatrix of the stump, and gradually extended till the patient died." " The section exhibits the skin much thickened and having the appearance of scirrhus; the muscles appear for the most part converted into a white substance like cartilage, retaining to a certain degree the fibrous form of muscle; in other parts the muscle is seen pale, as if gradually passing into the cartilaginous state. The adipose and cellular membrane have disappeared, so that the muscles appear to be matted to each other, and to the diseased skin. The larger nerves and blood-vessels are seen passing through the parts unchanged." This may have been a general tuberculosis of the skin, with degeneration of muscle following disuse. G. C. 221.

Tubercular Affection of Synovial Sheath, "Compound Ganglion."—Cast in gelatine and glycerine of the front of a left wrist of a woman, illustrating the above. " Mrs. W., aged 41, was admitted to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, in January 1891, complaining of pain and swelling in the palm of the left hand and wrist. Two years ago there appeared a swelling on the front of the wrist, unattended with pain, except under strong exertion. This remained unchanged until five weeks ago, when a swelling on the palm of the hand appeared also. The fingers became stiffer, and now she cannot grasp anything. Three years ago her foot was amputated for tubercular disease of the ankle. No other history of tubercle. Her- family history is good. Incisions were made in the wrist and palm, and gelatinous and melon seed-like bodies scraped out." There is a distinct swelling of the front of the wrist and adjacent part of the palm, with a slight constriction opposite the position of the anterior annular ligament. G. C. 3371.

Mrs M., aged 38 years, was admitted to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, in May 1892, complaining of a solid swelling in the front of both knees, limited to the region of the bursa. For three years the swelling on both knees, but especially that on the left, had gradually increased, apparently from the patient's having had an unusual amount of kneeling to do. Three months before admission a small abscess formed in the swelling on the left side, and after bursting formed a sinus, which continued to discharge. A fortnight before admission another abscess formed in front of the left swelling, but it had not discharged itself. The patient had had good health previous to the swelling, and had noSyphilitic Gfimma of Bursa. 549 -personal tubercular history, although one uncle had died of consumption.

The section shows the tumour to be composed of masses of fat bound together by layers of connective tissue into a uniform whole, which has no out-lying lobules. The centre of the tumour, where there is now a hollow, was filled with broken-down fat and oil, and many of the lobules near that part are softer in texture and darker in colour than those at the- periphery. This has been a degenerative change, associated with the great growth of the tumour. G. C. 3287. Presented by Johnson Symington, F.R.C.S.E., 1891. 9. 24.

Fibro-Sareomatous Tumour.—Sections of two large tumours removed from the right inguinal region—in spirit. The patient was a healthy man, about forty. Two and a-half years before the operation a small lump had appeared in the groin. It had grown slowly in the line of the groin, extending both towards and away from the middle line. In about six months from its first appear- ance it had passed into the scrotum, and for about four months after that it had not altered much. In its later growth it had projected more and more forwards. The patient worked up to within a few days of the operation without his fellow-workers knowing that there was anything wrong with him, although the bulk of the tumour had somewhat inter- fered with his stooping. There were no abnormal sensations in left leg ; he could move it as well as the other. The tumour surface was smooth, but could be recognised to be made up of four or five masses. On the summit there were several small reddened elevations. The main mass below felt quite firm and hard, but the smaller upper portions were softer. There was no pain on pressure.Diseases of Connective Tissue. 554 At the operation, Dr Joseph Bell easily dissected out the lower scrotal part along with the testicle. The upper part, however, had penetrated into the ahdomen and involved the peritoneum, part of which was cut in removing the intra-abdominal mass. Besides the portions removed, there were other parts which passed so deeply into the pelvis that they could not be interfered with. The patient made a good recovery from the operation, but his after history was not traced. The larger part, to which the testicle and a piece of the skin is adherent, has the appearance in section of a well- formed, firm, fibrous tumour. The smaller part, while originally a continuation of the larger piece, is partially separated from it, and shows a much softer and more uniform structure, with a fibrous tissue less well developed. The portions which had to be abandoned seemed at the time to be softer still. The specimen is an illustration of a tumour which, although firm, fibrous, and slow-growing in the main, has certain parts more rapidly growing and infiltrating in character, and corres- pondingly softer and more embryonic in structure.

Sarcomatous Tumour.—A large tumour with overlying skin laid open—in spirit. " The tumour had been growing for eight years. The patient stated that it had followed a brain fever, during which ' he had several tumours on the back, all of which broke and dispersed excepting this one.' The tumour, about the size of two hands, lay between the shoulders. It was nodular on the surface, and had discharged blood and matter, so- as to weaken his health." At the operation, which was performed by Mr. Allen, haemorrhage was profuse. Eleven arteries were tied, and the actual cautery applied in two places. The patient died a fortnight after the operation apparently of pyaemia. The tumour has involved the skin and protruded through it.

A tumour, composed of two masses "about the size of a fist," had originally been removed from her abdominal wall, and had been pronounced at the time of the operation to be sarcomatous. This tumour had returned, and had grown for two years before the patient consulted Dr. Thomas Keith, who removed it. Some years after the second removal, the patient was seen by Dr. Skene Keith. She was then in good health, without any indication of a return of the tumour. The masses posteriorly have an imperfect form of capsule round them. Anteriorly they involve the skin. G. C. 2922.

It increased gradually and uniformly from that time, impeding as it became larger the motion of the joint ; and although at all times uneasy, yet it did not give her any great pain. Five weeks before she came to Edin- burgh the tumour became suddenly more painful, acquiring at the same time a considerable increase of bulk. The gentleman who attended her, suspecting that suppuration was about to take place, applied emollient557 Sarcomata. Presented by W. Brown, F.K.C.S.E. poultices, and at the end of a fortnight the most prominent part of the tumour burst, and discharged a quantity of thin, bloody, ichorous matter. The discharge continued, and became very offensive to the smell; the pain increased, the swelling enlarged, and a fungous excrescence appeared at the opening from which the matter had been discharged. She became feverish, restless, and uneasy, and the case being considered cancerous, she came to Edinburgh. The amputation of the arm being thought necessary, the operation was performed. The tumour on dissection presented a structure in every respect similar to that described in page 107 (9. 50b), and delineated in plate v. Nothing particular occurred during the progress of the cure, excepting that the ligature on the brachial artery did not come away till about three months after the operation. Soon afterwards she was attacked by violent pains in the leg and thigh, which were supposed to be rheumatic, and several swellings appeared in the breast, and one near the spine, which, from what'l could learn, probably resembled the original swelling of the arm. I never saw her after this time; but I was informed that she died in great agony, in seven months from the time the arm was amputated.

It increased gradually to the size of a hen's egg, in which state it remained for two years. After this period it increased rapidly, and she was advised to get it removed. The operation was performed and the wound healed up, excepting a spot about the size of a shilling, which was suddenly affected with a violent stinging pain. The surface of this ulcer began to be elevated above the surface of the adjacent skin, and increased after that time, so as to attain the size of the tumour represented in the plate " (see Cast, No. 9. 54). . . . " The whole mass resembled, in a very remarkable degree, a portion of brain—in colour, consistence, and every external character ; and as the arm was injected with coloured size, many vessels could be traced through the substance of the tumour, being a strong proof of its organisa- tion.

Recurrent Fibroid Tumour of the Loin.—Section of a tumour with a cicatrix in the overlying skin, removed from the loin of a young woman for the third time—in spirit. The following notes of the case are taken from Professor Spence's- Snrgery, vol. i. 2nd edition, page 186. "Jane Easton first consulted the late Dr Maclagan in the year 1832. At that time she was 22 years of age, and applied for advice in consequence of a tumour of some three years' growth, situated in the left lumbar region, about one inch from the spine. It was about the size of a jargonelle° pear, firm, but elastic in consistence, and freely movable. Below the tumour the skin for some little distance was indurated. The- tumour, and also the adjoining diseased skin, were removed, and the growth was on examination found to present the ordinary characters of a simple fibrous tumour. About a year afterwards, however, a recurrence of the- growth took place, in the form of three small tumours, situated in the cicatrix, resulting from the former operation. These tumours, together with the scar, were thoroughly removed by Dr Douglas Maclagan in 1S34 ;. but again, 18 months later, the growth for the third time appeared in the same situation as before. After increasing in bulk for a year and a half, this was also removed by Dr D. Maclagan, and was found to posses* the same firmness and elasticity, and to present the same semi-transparent pinkish-grey colour as was noticed in the original tumour." About twenty years afterwards, i.e. March 1857, she was seen by . Professor Spence, on account of another tumour, 2J in. long, li broad,, and H in. at its thickest part. This tumour had grown for a year in the old cicatrix. It was of an elastic nature, and had a pinkish translucent appearance at the surface. It was freely removed, along with the adjacent lumbar fascise and surrounding scar, and there was no return. In 1S6S the patient again came under Professor Spence's care for a firm, fibrous tumour of the right mamma, of about the size of a small half melon. This and the mamma were removed, and she made a good recovery. OdRecurrent Fibroid Tumours. 563 27th August 1870 she .applied to Professor Spence again on account of a second growth in her breast near the cicatrix of the last operation. It had been growing for some months, and had reached the size of a small melon. This was also removed successfully. On 2nd June 1871 Professor Spence was called to see her. She was then in a moribund condition from broncho- pneumonia and pericarditis, with inability to swallow even fluids. There was a discharging ulcer in her right arm-pit. This had been due to a. swelling which formed near the cicatrix of the last operation, and had then burst and discharged matter. At the post-mortem examination numerous small white nodules were found in the left pleural sac, varying from the size of a millet seed to that of a pea. There was a fibrous structure of the oesophagus near the stomach, and three fibroid tumours attached to the uterus. It is difficult to say whether the axillary ulcer was due to a softening tumour or not. Possibly a recurrent tumour had given rise to the nodules in the pleura. This case is referred to by Sir James Paget in his lectures on Pathology. The specimen shows a somewhat uniform texture without any capsule separating it from the fascia? round about. On the skin are well seen the cicatrices due to former operations G. C. 1831 Presented by A. D. Maclagan, F.R.C.S.E., 21st October 1836. 59. Recurrent Fibroid Tumour.—Portion of a left arm after amputation, showing several sarcomatous tumours laid open—in spirit. James D., aged 78, was admitted to the Royal Infirmary on 13th August 1892, complaining of lumps in his forearm, which were sometimes painful. About 18 months before admission, the patient's daughter had drawn his attention to a swelling on his left forearm, almost as big as the present one. He had been quite unaware of its presence up to that time. It was situated on the inner aspect of the forearm on its upper third. The mass grew much larger in a short time, and was removed by Dr Dickson Carnoustie, on 26th July 1891. The wound had just healed, when a second lump made its appearance, and this, he thinks, did not grow so quickly as the first, and did not attain the same size. It was also removed by Dr Dickson in November 1891. Another growth appeared, and was removed m March 1892. These fresh growths appeared in the region of the first, close to the wound of operation. About a month or six weeks after the last operation another lump appeared, this being rather higher up the forearm, according to the patient, than the previous ones. The growtli was not very rapid at first, but during the last month had grown very rapidly. The patient was recommended by Dr Dickson to go to the Edinburgh Infirmary, which he did.564 Diseases of Connective Tissue. The patient on admission was a healthy-looking man, very vigorous for his years. There were extensive scars on the upper and outer parts of his left forearm and lower part of the upper arm. Just above the elbow, below a portion of the scar, a large mass of new growth projected on the outside, and reached over the front to the inside. The skin over it was thin, very vascular, and of a purple plum-colour. On the forearm, "beneath the cicatrices, were two separate nodules about the size of a bantam's egg, which did not involve the skin. The hand was useless, and the fingers were stiff. The arm was amputated on August 9th, and the patient made a good recovery. On section the substance of the large mass was like that, •of an inflamed lymphatic gland, grey in colour, soft, juicy, and vascular in texture, and at one or two places it showed a softening like mucoid degeneration. It seemed encapsuled at most places, hut at one spot the muscles were infiltrated. The substance of the smaller nodules was firmer and less vascular, but similar to that of the large mass. Microscopically the tumour is composed of round and spindle cells. G. C. 3447. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1892. '9. 60.

In three years it had grown to be the size of a hen's egg. At that time he fell and struck it, when it inflamed, became painful, and soon was as large as two fists. It got still larger, and was dissected oat by Mr Newbigging on 29th May 1810, at which time it hadRecurrent Fibroid Tumours. 565 leached the dimensions of a child's head. The wound healed up, and the- patient remained well for nine months, when the tumour reappeared, and had reached the size of two fists by 29th October 1811, when Mr Russell excised it. The cicatrix healed up, but in nine months again it grew and increased gradually to the size of the head of a child seven or eight years old, with the skin over it inflamed, and a dark fungus protruding. It was dissected out by Mr Allan from among the muscles of the back. It again healed ; but in seven months the tumour reappeared and grew very quickly, so that in two months more it was as big as at the last operation. It had a spongy elastic feeling. The skin at some places was congested over it. It was removed by Mr John Bell, and the patient made a good recovery. He went home till March 1815, when he found the tumour beginning for the fifth time. It grew quickly, and by June 13, 1816, it formed a large pedunculated mass. His health was now impaired. The tumour was removed by Mr Allan by a ligature gradually tightened, but it returned again early in 1817, and by the 9th of September, when he returned to Edinburgh, the disease formed a mass as follows:— "The tumour was lobulated, and in three divisions; the largest, the size of a quartern loaf; the second, the size of the head of a full-grown foetus, and the third smaller ; in all, three feet across at the base. From the surface of these there sprung three fungi respectively of the size of a full-sized cauliflower, a fist, and a small apple. He died about the 22nd January 1818 from exhaustion, but without visceral affection. Thus he lived about thirteen years from the first appearance of the tumour, and seven years eight months after the first removal." See Allan's Surgery, vol. i. p. 264. Maclachlan & Stewart, 1821. The tumour is somewhat lobulated, of a soft uniform texture, with very little fibrous tissue in the interior. It is- tending to degenerate at numerous points so as to form small cysts- G.

Cathcatvt, F.K.C.S.E., 1891. This is most probably the cast from the patient from whom the previous two specimens were obtained. It must have been taken not long before his death, and after the tumour had recurred for the fifth and last time. A cause of uncertainty, however, is that this tumour is on the right side, whereas the previous specimens were described originally as having been above the left haunch. Possibly, however, the tumour in its recurrence had attacked chiefly the right side, or there may have been a misprint. G. C. 3502. 9. 64. Recurrent Fibroid Tumour, which became dissem- inated.—Papier-mache cast of a tumour in the groin before its removal for the third time from the same place. Mrs B., aged 55, received a blow above the right knee. Five months afterwards (June 1879) a tumour of the size of an orange was removed from the injured place ; another tumour was removed from the same place in June 1881 ; another in January 1883 ; and a fourth in May 1883. There was no return above the knee, but from the groin a similar tumour was removed in June 1883, a second from the groin was removed in November 1883, and a third (of which this is a cast) in June 1884. While the wound from the last (seventh) operation was healing, numerous nodules appeared in the subcutaneous tissue at various parts of the body, and some could be felt within the abdomen. The patient died shortly afterwards, and at the post-mortem examination nodules of sarcoma we're found in the liver, lungs, and heart, and in many parts of the subcutaneous tissue. G. C. 2738.

Secondary Sarcoma in the Heart.—Preparation of the heart of an elderly man, with both ventricles laid open to show sarcoma in the wall—in spirit. Several years before death the patient had undergone amputation of the leg for a round-celled sarcomatous growth, which had developed in an old ulcer. The stump {vide 11.84) remained sound, but the disease returned in the brain as well as in the heart and lungs. The heart is attacked by secondary deposits of sarcoma which have caused pericarditis, and in consequence adhesion of the surfaces of the pericardium. Near the apex of the right ventricle the invasion of the muscular substance by the disease is especially well seen. A portion of the adherent pericardium has been dissected away from the front and upper parts of the beart. G. C. 2815. Presented by Charles "W. Cathcart, F.E.C.S.E., 1888. 67.

Contraction of the Fingers from a Burn.—Gelatine and glycerine cast of the right hand of a woman—illustrating the above. The skin of the hack of the hand has been destroyed by a burn, and the three inner fingers are in consequence drawn together, and partly dislocated backwards. The deformity was afterwards improved by a plastic operation by Mr J. Shaw M'Laren. G. C. 3203. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1890. 11. 5. Hand deformed by a Burn.—Plaster of Paris cast of • the hand and forearm of an old man—illustrating the above. In childhood his hand had been severely burned. Some of the fingers had evidently been destroyed, and as the skin contracted during the healing of the burn, the fingers were drawn in, and the hand distorted. The forearm ends in a club-shaped extremity, bent over towards the flexor aspect of the forearm, and furnished with three nobs, which having nails, are recognisable as fingers. G. C. 3523. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1893. 11. 6. Distortion of the Foot from Injury.—Inner half of a left foot—in spirit, illustrating the above.

Distortions from Injury. entirely on the balls of his toes. An ulcer, which formed below the heel, had given him so much trouble, that he wished the foot amputated. " The bones were atrophied and fatty, see No. 6. 15. The skin over the forepart of the foot and toes is coarse. The papillae are enlarged, especially on the second toe, which has a club-shaped extremity, and a very warty surface. G. C. 2818. Presented by P. H. MacLaren, F.R.C.S.E., 1888. 11. 7. Distortion of Foot by Compression.—Plaster cast of the right foot of a Chinese lady, showing distortion, artificially produced. The four outer toes are doubled under the sole. The metatarsal and central tarsal bones are forced upwards, so that the ball of the great toe nearly touches the heel, and the usual arch of the foot is now represented by a narrow cleft in front of the heel. The bones generally, but especially the tarsal bones, have evidently been stunted in their growth. G. C. 3534. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1893. 11. 8. Hand distorted from Injury to the Ulnar Nerve. —Plaster of Paris cast of a right hand, illustrating the above. By a machinery accident, 5£ years before the cast was taken, the hand and forearm of the patient, a woman, had been severely lacerated, and the thumb destroyed. Her hand remained from that time stiff, powerless, and very painful, and gradually assumed this shape. The exaggerated extension of the first phalanges, with flexion of the last two, is, as Duchenne pointed out, due to atrophy of the intrinsic muscles of the palm, following paralysis of the ulnar nerve. The deformity is known as "main au Griffon," or "Claw hand." G. C. 3111.The Limbs as a Whole. 574 DEFORMITIES OF THE LIMBS. Upper Limb, a. From Deficiency in Development. 11. 9.

The tibia is apparently well formed at the knee-joint, but half-way down it tapers to a fine point, which had partly pro- jected through the skin. The fibula is unusually strong, and is bent inwards near its lower end. The foot is displaced inwards, as in talipes varus, and the astragalus articulates with the side of the lower end of the fibula. The muscles are fairly well developed. G. C. 2504.

There was no family history of deformity. At birth both the first and second toes were unusually large, and they grew much more rapidly than the others. The second toe, being the larger, was amputated in infancy. Some years before the cast was taken the great toe had ceased to grow ; but as the projection of the nail caused inconvenience, it was excised by Mr A. G. Miller. The enlargement seemed to be chiefly in the soft parts. The three outer toes arid the outer parts of the foot are apparently normal. The enlargement of the great toe extends backwards over the dorsum to about opposite the base of the first metatarsal bone. ' G. C. 2856. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1888. 11. 23.

Flat Foot, from Injury.—Plaster of Paris cast of a, right foot, illustrating the above. The patient, a healthy man of 28 years, stated that when 10 years- of age he fell from a height of twenty feet, and landed on his feet. For nine months after the accident he had been a patient in the Dundee- Infirmary, and for nine months more he had been unable to walk properly. After that, however, he quite recovered the use of his feet, although they remained deformed. He was under treatment in the Royal Infirmaiy,.

On the left side the shaft from the junction of the middle and lower thirds downwards has the appearance of having been bent outwards, and the inner condyle has projected markedly downwards. Part of the surface of the inner condyle has been injured in the process of maceration, but enough remains to show that its contour has been rounded. The contour of the outer condyle, on the other hand, is flat, as if the bone had been compressed. The articular surface of the outer condyle is irregular, and the margins show an overgrowth of bone, such as is seen in arthritis deformans. This latter change is seen also on the lower end of the right femur, which, however, may otherwise be considered as normal. The tibiee, and especially the left, are both altered towards the upper end by a twisting of the head of the bone inwards upon the shaft. In addition, on the left side the outer tuberosity has sunk markedly down, and the articular margins have irregular projections, The upper part of the shaft is distorted by an apparent flattening from before backwards. The fibulae have been bent forward at the lower end, and twisted with the tibia at the upper. The margins of the outer maleoli are irregular, and the grooves for the585 Knock-knee. peroneus longus tendons are filled up. Both feet, but especially the left, have been in a condition of talipes varus. On the outer side of the os calcis the groove for the peroneus longus is unduly prominent, especially on the right side, where new bone has been formed round it. The whole of the bones, but especially those of the left side, are light, soft, and greasy. G. C. 3489. Presented by A. Miles, F.R.C.S.E., 1893. . 48. Genu-Valgum.—Left femur of an adult—macerated, illus- trating the above. The bone has been mounted in a nearly vertical position. The inner condyle is relatively much lower than the outer. The increased quantity of bone on the inside is apparently just above the condyle. The centre of the articular surface of the condyle is similar. The upper end of the shaft is flattened from before backwards, and a strong ridge leads down from the neck along the inner side of the shaft. The neck itself is unusually horizontal. B. C. i. i.

No number was attached to this specimen, but it is evidently the one from which the foregoing cast has been taken. The papillae of the skin of the foot are much exaggerated. The swelling has in many places been apparently due to oedema, for the skin can be pressed down upon the deeper parts as if it were an indiarubber ball. The papilla? of the skin of the foot, except on that part of the sole which has borne pressure, are much exaggerated, and stand out individually as on a carnivorous animal's tongue. The bones of the leg where sawn across seem quite natural, without any appearance of enlarge- ment. The substance of the muscles is opened out, as if traversed by numerous channels. G. C. 1821a.

Dry Senile Gangrene of Leg and Foot-Spontane-590 The Limbs as a Whole. OUS Separation.—Lower portion of a left leg and foot—in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient was a very stout old woman, aged 78. She had shown premonitory symptoms in both legs, i.e. cramps, pain and coldness, which were thought, at first, to be due to gout. The gangrene began in the great toe, and gradually spread up the leg until it came just below the head of the fibula, where a line of demarcation was found. Amputation was not performed owing to the patient having advanced heart and kidney disease. The dead soft tissues were therefore cut through just below the line of demarcation, and an ineffectual attempt was made to destroy the bone by nitric and hydro-chloric acids. However, a month afterwards, the leg separated spontaneously. The stump healed over after a small fragment of dead bone had separated, and she went about on crutches and died 18 months afterwards of apoplexy. The soft parts are shrivelled and discoloured. The upper ends of the bones are irregular and rough, owing to the natural mode of separation by granulations. G. C. 3167. Presented by Dickinson Leigh, M.D., 1890. 11. 65.

Advancing Moist Senile Gangrene of Foot.—A left leg and foot—dissected, and in spirit, iUustrating the above. The patient, a woman aged 62, was admitted to Mr Miller's Ward Eoyal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on 4th November 1889, suffering from moist gangrene of the left great toe which was advancing up the foot. A month before while paring the great toe nail of the left foot, she had accidentally cut the toe. ■ The wound inflamed and suppurated. She had severe pain in the foot, which was treated without benefit by poultices After three weeks the pain gradually diminished and disappeared The foot however, got cold and black. On November 7th the leg was amputated above the knee, and on the 9th she died.The Limbs as a Whole. 592 The discoloured and sloughy condition of the great toe is well seen, but the discolouration which existed upon the other toes and on the dorsum of the foot has been removed by the spirit. The arteries were injected with vermilion and tallow. The injection has run down the anterior tibial artery as far as the dorsum of the foot, but beyond that only a little has been able to penetrate. The coat of the anterior tibial artery is atheromatous and filled with calcareous plates the whole way. On the posterior aspect, the injection has penetrated only to the level of the upper third of the leg, in the posterior tibial artery, and to about the middle of the leg in the peroneal artery. Beyond these points both vessels are so much con- tracted that the injection could not flow in them. Their coats- are studded with calcareous plates in a manner very similar to that found in the anterior tibial artery. It may be noted, more- over, that the parts near the anterior tibial artery have received the injection down to, although not beyond, the ankle, whereas the injection posteriorly has only reached as far as the middle of the calf.

Advancing- Moist Senile Gangrene of Foot.—Left foot and greater part of a leg, blood-vessels dissected—in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient was a man, aged 70. The condition began in the great toe, and it was amputated. The mischief returned, and he had a slowly increasing septic absorption from inflammation and suppuration of the foot, with great pain and sleeplessness. The leg was amputated below the knee, but the patient died three or four days afterwards. There was little or no bleeding from the vessels at the operation, probably because they were blocked near the bifurcation of the popliteal artery. On dissecting out the arteries, the posterior tibial was found to be obliterated at its upper end by what seems to have been an old-standing clot, now apparently incorporated with the walls of the vessel. Below that point the vessel hasMoist Senile Gangrene. 593 shrunk, but its lumen is still recognisable. The vessel wall throughout its whole extent is infiltrated with calcareous particles. The peroneal artery is likewise obliterated at its upper part, but the clot seems more recent. Lower down the condition of this vessel is similar to that of the posterior tibial artery. The veins were found empty and are nowhere throm- bosed. The anterior tibial artery is obliterated at its upper part, while lower down its lumen is contracted and is in places obliterated. The gangrenous and sloughing state of the fore- part of the foot is well shown. The great toe was amputated at a previous operation. G. C. 3377. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1892. 72. Moist Senile Gangrene of the Foot and Leg-.—Lower part of a left leg and part of foot, blood-vessels dissected—in spirit, illustrating the above. The forepart of the foot was removed for convenience in mounting the specimen. The patient, a woman aged 68, had a history of gradually increasing debility for a year, but with no premonitory symptoms of gangrene in the limb. A severe pain in the left foot and lower half of the left leg occurred suddenly, four months before her admission to the infirmary. Three days later the foot grew cold. The pain increased, and discolouration of the parts began. The latter gradually increased, but the pain subsided There was no known cause for the onset of the disease. The le<r was amputated, and the patient made a good recovery. The posterior tibial artery is completely blocked at its upper part by a firm clot, which has apparently become adherent to the walls. The blocking continues down to about where the peroneal artery is given off. The continuation of the posterior tibial artery was accidentally removed in dissecting the. specimen, but a small portion left at the upper end shows the vessel to have been greatly contracted. Its coat is thin, and only a few particles of lime salts can be felt upon it. The peroneal artery, although the larger of the two, is small and contracted, and its interior is occupied by a fine clot. Its coat also is only slightly thickened, and contains but few calcareous particles 2 p594 The Limls as a Whole. The posterior tibial vein at its upper part seems to have been thrombosed during life. The anterior tibial artery is somewhat contracted; its coat thickened, and contains a few calcareous particles. In the interior there was a loose clot in many places. The discoloured gangrenous portion is separated from the rest of the leg by a line of demarcation. The tissues in the gangrenous part are soft and oily from degeneration, while those in the upper part are dry and free from oil and fat. This seems to have been a case of embolus of the artery rather than of thrombosis. Gr. C. 3147. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.K.C.S.E., 1890. 11. 73.

Moist Senile Gangrene of Hand and Forearm.—Left hand and forearm—in spirit, partially dissected to illustrate the above. The patient, a woman aged 79 years, was an inmate of a workhouse. The medical attendant's report was as follows :— "She had fatty degeneration of the heart's muscle, and extensive atheromatous disease of blood-vessels, and occasionally had fits of an epileptic character, due, I think, to localised brain softening. Her last illness dated from July 23rd, when she fell over the bed while asleep, and sustained an injury to the left arm. The trouble began in the fingers, and spread gradually to the hand and arm, assuming all the appearances of moist gangrene. She was comatose two or three days before death, which took place on 13th August 1888." The arm was decomposing and putrid during life. The tissues in the gangrenous part are oily and soft from decomposition.595 Moist Senile Gangrene. The brachial artery, when laid open, was found to be atheromatous, and at its bifurcation had fibrinous clots, which partly obstructed its lumen. The upper part of the ulnar artery was patent, though atheromatous, but in the upper end of the radial artery a firm clot completely occluded about an inch of the lumen. On the radial side of the limb the gangrene extends higher than in the ulnar side. Moreover, on the radial side, and posteriorly, the line of demarcation is complete ; while on the ulnar side, and anteriorly, it is incomplete. These differences on the two sides may be associated with the differ- ence in the patency of the respective arteries. Attention is directed to the important parts of the arteries by means of blue rods. This specimen may be taken as an illustration of what is probably always the case in moist senile gangrene, i.e., that besides a greatly impaired condition of the local circulation, there is a septic fermentation in the tissues. On this account, so long as any circulation remains, it is in a condition of inflam- mation. The tissues, moreover, which from their impaired nutrition were unable to resist the entrance of sepsis, soon die after it has been established. Thus an area of septic inflam- mation once begun rapidly advances and soon ends in gangrene. By the time the process has passed through the region whose circulation has primarily been impaired, the patient may have sunk from septic absorption, or the even previously well- nourished tissues may have become hopelessly saturated with decomposing fluids from the part beyond. The general symptoms of moist senile gangrene may be traced to septic absorption and pain. q. q 2790 Presented by G. M. Johnston, M.D., 1888. Other Forms of Gangrene. 75.

Traumatic Gangrene, complicated by Sepsis.— Gelatine and glycerine cast of a right leg and foot, illustrating the above. The patient, a strong labourer, had his foot crushed by the fall of a heavy stone, and he was admitted to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on the same night. The next morning the foot was cold, and gangrene was feared. By the fourth morning after the accident, gangrene of the foot had become pronounced, and as it seemed to be spreading up the leg, ampu- tation was performed above the knee. The patient made a good recovery. The tissues in the foot were decomposing. The posterior tibial artery was found to be ruptured, the soft parts much bruised, and the os calcis crushed, while there was a severe Pott's fracture of the fibula with wrenching off of the inner malleolus. See No. 3, 313. The cast shows the discolouration of the foot, the blebs which appeared, and the peeling off of the epidermis. Above the ankle there were several blebs and much discolouration. Tnis, it was feared, showed advancing gangrene, but it may have been due only to extensive extravasation. G. C. 2850. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E.597 Gangrene. 11. 78.

George M , aged 26, had his arm crushed by a stone weighing about 30 cwt., which was lowered too rapidly while he was smoothing the mortar for its bed. The forearm and elbow-joint were severely injured. A local doctor bandaged the arm, and the patient arrived at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, at about 7 p.m. on 19th August 1890. Mr Cathcart amputated the limb 3£ or 4 inches above the condyles. About 1st September, when the wound was nearly healed, the patient showed signs of tetanus. On the morning of September 3rd Mr Cathcart performed Spence's amputation at the shoulder-joint. The tetanic spasms, which had been very severe, improved for a time, and the patient fell asleep at 1 p.m. He woke, however, at 1.45 p.m., and after three spasms, died in a fourth, which was prolonged. The end of the median nerve is slightly enlarged, the end of the brachial artery has been filled by a clot, and its termination has been surrounded by organising lymph. The wound had almost entirely healed, and the section shows how the skin had covered in the cut end of the muscle. G. C. 3204. Presented by Chaiiles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1890. 11. 83.

This amputation was performed for epithelioma of the hand and forearm. A second amputation, which was at the shoulder-joint, was performed nine weeks after the first, for a recurrence of the disease in the axillary glands. The man died soon after the second operation. The brachial artery, which is injected, is seen to tail off into fibrous tissue (green rod) below its last branch. The calibre of the vessel is not much altered in the greater part of its course. The main nerves have apparently been shortened at the operation. The cut end of the median nerve is -slightly bulbous, and a filament from it passes in front of the artery. The end of the ulnar nerve is only slightly enlarged. A rod is passed below the ends of both the ulnar and median nerves. The end of the musculo-spiral nerve is not enlarged. A thick pad of subcutaneous tissue covers the end of the bone, which has been sawn up. The fibres of the supinator radii longus muscle are seen to run into fibrous tissue below. G. C. 2793.

"Whether a secondary amputation was required, or whether the patient died from other causes, is uncertain, but from the appearance of the stump the latter seems more probable. The end of the bone is somewhat rounded off, but the extremity has not been covered in. F. P. C. 229. 11. 91. Stump of a Femur long after Amputation.—Small piece of bone—macerated, illustrating the above. The secondary amputation was performed on account of "irritable stump " (i.e. enlargement and painful condition of the ends of the nerves). The bone is greatly atrophied, and its extremity roundedThe Limbs as a Whole. 602 and tapered off. The linea aspera projects at the back, and its prominence is probably due to its having had muscles attached to it, which remained in use. B. C. i. 5. M. 48. 11. 92. Stump of Radius long" after Amputation. — Upper two-thirds of a radius—macerated, illustrating the above. The bone is light, and the muscular ridges are feebly de- veloped. The extremity is rounded off, but covered with a slight crust of new periosteal bone, which extends a little way up the shaft. B. C. 1. 5. M. 45. 11. 93. Stump of a Phalanx after Amputation.—First and part of second phalanx of a finger—macerated, illustrating the above. The piece of bone at the end of the phalanx seems to be the atrophied stump of the second phalanx, after amputation. G. C. 3313. b. Diseases in Stumps—Septic Changes. 11. 94. Stump of a Fibula which has been Inflamed.— Section of portion of a fibula—macerated, illustrating the above. The distal end of the bone has evidently been sawn across. New periosteal bone has formed for some distance above the lower end. The interior of the inflamed part is now filled with adipocere. B. C. 1. 5. M. 21. 11. 95. Stump of the Bones of a Leg after Amputation Thickened.—Portion of a right tibia and fibula—macerated, illustrating the above. Both bones are considerably thickened, and some new peri- osteal bone has been formed for some distance up the shaft of603 Pathology of Stumps. each, especially upon the tibia. A firm mass of bone unites their distal ends together. Possibly this condition has been due to a chronic ulcer on face of the stump. B. C. 1. 5. M. 43. 11. 96. Stump of a Femup, with Necrosis and Thicken- ing".—Section of the injected stump of a femur—macerated, illustrating the above. A small necrosed fragment at the end has been in process of separation, and a strong crust of new bone has been formed round the sawn extremity. W. C. G. 22. 11. 97. Stump of a Femur after Amputation. — Section of the injected stump of a femur—in spirit, illustrating the above. Eound the sawn extremity there is a considerable crust of bone, which extends for some distance up the shaft, while new bone has been forming across the end of the medullary cavity. The vascularity of the new bone is well shown by the injection. The large amount of new bone has, no doubt, been due to septic inflammation of the soft parts over the bone. B. C. 1. 5. M. 44. 11.98. Stump of a Femur, altered by Chronic Septic Osteo-myelitis.—Enlarged end of a femur after amputation— macerated, illustrating the above. The lower end is rounded in shape, but its surface is irregular and is covered by a spongy carious bone. The whole shaft is greatly thickened. The original compact tissue cannot be traced. The wall of the medullary cavity is formed of bone, which is intermediate in character between cancellous and compact tissue. It is of irregular thickness. W. C. G. 23.604 The Limbs as a Whole. 11.99. Stump of a Syme's Amputation, affected by Tuberculosis.—Section of the tibia and soft parts of a left leg—injected with carmine, and in spirit, illustrating the above. The foot was amputated for tubercular disease of the ankle-joint. A re-amputation became necessary on account of return of the disease in the bone and soft parts. In the heel flap is seen a large abscess cavity, lined by Granulations. In the interior of the tibia a condition of chronic tubercular osteo-myelitis tending to caseation is seen to have spread upwards from the sawn surface. G. C. 2872. Presented by P. H.

Stump of an Amputation through the First Phalanx Of the Finger.—Gelatine and glycerine cast of a right hand—illustrating the above. The patient was an old woman, whose third finger had been ampu- tated through the first joint in early life. The cast was taken in the extended position to show that the stump of the first phalanx extended equally with the other fingers. G. C. 289S. Presented by Charles W.

This cast shows that the stump of the first phalanx flexed equally with the other fingers. G. C. 2897. Presented by Chakles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1888. 104. Stump after Chopart's Amputation.—Plaster of Paris cast of a stump of a right foot, after the above operation. The cast shows that the heel has not been drawn up, and that the sole has been planted well on the ground. The arch of the foot has necessarily given way, but an admirable basis of support has been left, much better than that afforded by Syme's amputation. G. C. 3527. Presented by Chakles W.

INFLAMMATORY CHANGES IN BONE. 1. Changes in Bone due to Inflammation in the neighbouring soft parts. 6. 59. Development of Bone under an Ulcer—Sections of tibia and fibula—injected, and in spirit, showing the above. The patient was a lad 18 years of age, suffering from paraplegia. His foot had been amputated, and a bandage applied too firmly in the- after-dressing caused sloughing of the skin. While the resulting ulcer was in process of healing, secondary hemorrhage occurred, and necessitated a second amputation. The tibia is markedly vascular at the posterior and outer parts. The fibula is more uniformly vascular. The vascular part of the tibia shows a crust of bone on the surface, while the compact layer is somewhat opened out. Similar changes are shown on the fibula, especially at its outer side. G. C. 3170. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 60.

533 Tubercular Disease of the Spine. •cervical and upper nine dorsal vertebra;. The fused bodies form a single piece of cancellous bone, which is bent acutely upon itself. Opposite the centre of the bend there is a trace -of some of the intervertebral discs. Above and below that, however, the fusion is so perfect as to show no trace of the original separate bodies. The two unchanged vertebra? occupy a space nearly equal in length to that of the ten fused vertebra3 .above it. The intervertebral foramina? on the fused portion are •quite distinct, but the intervals between them have been greatly jeduced. The laminae of the fused vertebra? are likewise welded into a common piece. G. C. 3482. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1893. 7. 254.

The specimen shows the effects of tubercular disease which involved the whole of the dorsal vertebra?, except the first and the last. The bodies have fallen together, and the lower eight affected ones are anchylosed into a wedge-shaped mass of cancellous tissue, with its apex projecting backwards. The upper two affected vertebra? are anchylosed to one another, but not to the lower mass. The spinal canal is diminished slightly at the bend, but less so than would at first appear, because the section just at the bend is not quite mesial. To compensate for the marked backward projection in the upper dorsal region, the normal forward curves in the cervical and lumbar regions are greatly increased, so that the head still remains over the pelvis and the face looks upwards. The ribs are, as usual, greatly compressed, and the cavity of the thorax diminished. The pelvis is kyphotic, and the bones generally are very light. W. C. H. 71. 7. 255.

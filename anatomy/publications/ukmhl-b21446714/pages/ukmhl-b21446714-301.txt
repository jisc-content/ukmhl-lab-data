269 Caries from Septic Wounds. 6. 165. Rarefaction of Femur after Compound Fracture. —Lower end of a right femur—macerated, to illustrate the above. The broken surface is opened out, and some new bone has been developed near. At the back, near the upper end, there are two distinctly punched-out holes, possibly due to absorption by granulations. j? p q 397 6.166. Rarefaction of the Tibia after Compound Fracture. —Section of the distal end of a left tibia—macerated, to illustrate the above. There has been absorption of the upper end, with develop- ment of new bone on the adjacent surface, This has probably been a case of compound fracture, with prolonged suppuration. B. C. 1. 5. M. 81. 6. 167. Rarefaction of the Shaft of a Tibia, with some new Periosteal Growth from some Septic Condition. —Right tibia—macerated, illustrating the above. Over nearly the whole of the shin surface the bone is rarefied and rough. New bone has been thrown out on the posterior surface, with appearances very suggestive of septic inflammation. The anterior and posterior parts of the articular surface have apparently been attacked. B. C. 1. 5. M. 66. 6. 168. Rarefaction of the Shaft of the Femur from Sepsis after Amputation.-Portion of the shaft of a femur- macerated, illustrating the above. Septic inflammation must have followed the amputation Some periosteal bone has been thrown out for several inches above the lower end. The surface of the bone all over is opened out, evidently from absorption round the blood-vessel Uns is a good example of septic rarefactive ostitis, or what may be called a septic form of caries. B.

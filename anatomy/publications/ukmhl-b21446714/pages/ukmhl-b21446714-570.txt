538 Diseases of Joints. There was a large growth in front of the pelvis reaching to one and a half inches from the umbilicus. The growth was chiefly on the left side, and had most likely proceeded from another tumour on the left iliac bone. The whole pelvis was a mass of soft tumour. The ureter on the left side was greatly dilated. The dura mater was extremely adherent to the skull cap. In the posterior part of the superior longitudinal sinus there was a small pale tumour. Also on the left side, near the middle line, there was another tumour under the dura mater. The convolutions were somewhat pale. Vessels at base of brain were normal. The brain substance was extremely anaemic, and somewhat cedematous. From the second to sixth dorsal vertebra the cord was decidedly thinner (sic). It was quite firm in its whole extent, except at the upper part of the lumbar enlargement. The section shows the tumour to be composed of soft material, arranged in lobulated portions of slightly different colour and consistence, which are separated by a very delicate connective tissue. The'part most affected is the periosteum. There is apparently neither ossification nor invasion of bone. It was not possible to say where the primary tumour ha(L been situated in this case.

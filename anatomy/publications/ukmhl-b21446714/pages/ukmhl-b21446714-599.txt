567 Secondary Deposits of Sarcoma. Dissemination of Sarcoma. 66. Secondary Sarcoma in the Heart.—Preparation of the heart of an elderly man, with both ventricles laid open to show sarcoma in the wall—in spirit. Several years before death the patient had undergone amputation of the leg for a round-celled sarcomatous growth, which had developed in an old ulcer. The stump {vide 11.84) remained sound, but the disease returned in the brain as well as in the heart and lungs. The heart is attacked by secondary deposits of sarcoma which have caused pericarditis, and in consequence adhesion of the surfaces of the pericardium. Near the apex of the right ventricle the invasion of the muscular substance by the disease is especially well seen. A portion of the adherent pericardium has been dissected away from the front and upper parts of the beart. G. C. 2815. Presented by Charles "W. Cathcart, F.E.C.S.E., 1888. 67. Secondary Sarcoma in the Lung-.—Portion of a lung, imperfectly injected with vermilion, from the same patient as the last—in spirit. One large and several smaller nodules of tumour substance are shown in the interior of the lung. G. C. 2816. 68. Secondary Sarcoma in the Lung-.—Section of a lung, studded with nodules of sarcoma of varying size—in spirit. The patient, a young person, had suffered from a large sarcoma of the thigh, which was removed after ligature of the deep and superficial femoral artery as well as of the vein. The patient recovered from the opera- tion, but died from return of the disease in the lung. The lung is studded with rounded nodules of sarcomatous substance. G. C. 3270.

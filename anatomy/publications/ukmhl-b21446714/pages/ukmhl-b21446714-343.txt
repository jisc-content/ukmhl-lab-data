Healing after Syphilitic Necrosis. 311 6. 274. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull—healed after Loss Of Substance.—Portion of the right frontal and parietal bones of an old person—macerated, illustrating the above. On the outer surface there are numerous smooth excava- tions and tubercles, and at one place a small perforation, with rounded margins. On the inside the changes are very slight, merely some irregularity near the perforation. Tbe coronal suture is obliterated except at a small place near its lower end. This seems to be a case where the disease had completely subsided. Formerly described as " a caries of the left parietal W-" G. C. 370. 6. 275. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull—healed after Loss Of Substance—Skull-cap of an adult, with permanent frontal suture—macerated, illustrating the above. On the right parietal bone, near the vertex, is a circular depression, one and a half inches in diameter, with a sinuous rounded margin and irregular base, which has been smoothed over. This is as if a superficial sequestrum had been separated some time before, and the part had healed over. In front of the left parietal eminence is a shallow depression, with a base, which is at one place smooth and at others rough, as if the disease have been in process of cure. The interior of the skull shows some marks of increased vascularity. W. C. G. 18. 6. 276. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull—healed after Loss Of Substance.—Portion of the front of a calvarium, with permanent frontal suture—macerated, illustrating the above. There is a depression, one and a half inches long by one inch broad, between the frontal eminences. Its margins are bevelled off and smoothed over, and its base, which is also smoothed

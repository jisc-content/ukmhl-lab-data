Hypertrophy of Bladder Wall associated with old- standing Stricture of the Urethra-Preparation of bladder, part of penis, and urethra. The bladder and prostatic portion of urethra are opened from above. The prostatic abscess, and the membranous and spongy parts of the urethra, are opened from below.

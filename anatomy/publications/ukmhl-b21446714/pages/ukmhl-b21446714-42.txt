10 General Pathology. There is considerable hollowing out on the front of the vertebra?, and, as is usual in such cases, the bones have suffered more than the intervertebral discs, which stand out still com- paratively unchanged. The substance of the bones seems quite normal beyond the absorbed portion. G. C. 3103. 1. 30. Absorption of Vertebra from Pressure in Lateral Curvature.—Lower four cervical and upper nine dorsal vertebra, from a case of lateral curvature—macerated. In the concavity of the arch formed by the seventh, eighth, and ninth vertebras on the left side, the bodies have been compressed, and are in consequence much less in depth there than on the other side, where there is a convexity. This is due to the greater compression which always exists upon the concavity of an arch, as when a piece of wood is bent upon itself. G- C- 1637' Presented bij P.

Increased Vascularity of an Inflamed Part-Cast in gelatine and glycerine of a left hand, showing a condition of onychia-probably septic and tubercnlar-in a child aged 9 or 10 years. . Several months before the cast was taken the nail had been Wed in a gate, and the finger had remained inflamed.

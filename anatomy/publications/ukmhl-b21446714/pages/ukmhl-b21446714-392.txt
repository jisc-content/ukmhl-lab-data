Fibro-Osseous Tumour of Lower End of Femur.â€” Portions of bone from the previous specimen, which were developed in the fibrous tissue, but separate from the main mass. Their characteristics are similar. The tumour illustrated by this and the two preceding specimens may be classed as simple in the slowness of its growth and high development of most of its tissue, including a large proportion of bone, but as "malignant" in the steady increase of its size, in having disconnected centres of ossification, as well as in the arrangement of its bony plates. It should be stated also that while most of the fibrous tissue which formed it was fully developed, there were more rapidly growing parts which were softer in consistence and more embryonic in , . G.

She was admitted to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on 5th August 1859, under the care of Dr. Gillespie. The tumour had grown for four years, " gradually encroach- ing on the tibia and towards the ankle." -The exostosis was broadest at its attachment to the bone ' It had caused the absorption for a considerable portion of the anterior and outer portion of the tibia."

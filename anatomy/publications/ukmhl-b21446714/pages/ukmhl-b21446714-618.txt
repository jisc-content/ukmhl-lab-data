The Limbs as a Whole. 586 Presented by T. Burn Murdoch, M.B., 1892. is lost; and the aptness of the term " elephantiasis " is at once felt. The cast resembles the foot of an elephant much more than that of a man. G. C. 1821. Presented by Dr Robertson, August 1836. 11. 51. Elephantiasis of Leg".—Foot from which the previous cast was taken—in spirit. No number was attached to this specimen, but it is evidently the one from which the foregoing cast has been taken. The papillae of the skin of the foot are much exaggerated. The swelling has in many places been apparently due to oedema, for the skin can be pressed down upon the deeper parts as if it were an indiarubber ball. The papilla? of the skin of the foot, except on that part of the sole which has borne pressure, are much exaggerated, and stand out individually as on a carnivorous animal's tongue. The bones of the leg where sawn across seem quite natural, without any appearance of enlarge- ment. The substance of the muscles is opened out, as if traversed by numerous channels. G. C. 1821a. Bupuytren's Contraction of the Palmar Fascia. 11. 52. Dupuytren's Contraction.—Plaster of Paris cast of a right hand—illustrating the above. The subject was a man 65 years of age, alcoholic and gouty, but without having had any acute attack of gout. The condition was present for thirty or forty years, and was supposed to have been caused by hard delving in Ceylon. He declined any operation. The cast shows a drawing down, especially of the middle finger, and a ridge formed by the thickened fascia?, where it has- been stretched. The thumb is also partly drawn down. G. C. 3403.

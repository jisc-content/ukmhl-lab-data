Gunshot fractures of the Skull. 59 cranial surface the bone is chipped off irregularly round. At the back, in the right side of the occipital bone, between the superior curved line and the lambdoidal suture, there is a larger and more irregular aperture measuring by 1^ inch. In this case the greater irregularity and chipping off is seen on the outer surface, while the cranial margin is smooth, a condition the reverse of what is present at the anterior aperture. As it is known that with the musket ball, at least, the entrance wound in the skull was smaller than the exit wound, and that the bevelling is with any bullet always on the margins of the apertures towards which the bullet is travelling, the condition of the apertures in this skull entirely corroborate the historical account of the action on that part of the battle- field on which it was found.

The man, who was a servant, had shot himself. He lived for forty- eight hours afterwards. The bullet split in two. One part was found beneath the scalp, three inches from the wound, and the other part passed inwards, and was found beside the falciform process of the dura mater. The hole is larger in its vertical than in its transverse measurement, probably from the upward direction of the shot, and the chipping is greater upon the cranial than upon the outer margin of the aperture. It may be noted that the bevelling is greater on the inner and upper surfaces, than upon the posterior and lower surfaces, probably indicating the direction of the bullet. At the upper part of the outer margin some lead has been impacted. This probably points to where the ball was 8Plifc- B. C. xvu. 2. . 50.

215 Rickets. spine. The humerus has an outward and forward curve at the insertion of the deltoid, and the internal condyle is unusually prominent. The radius and ulna are bent towards the ulnar side, having thus a curve with its convexity forwards and outwards. B. C. i. 3. M. 31. 6. 33. Distortion of the Upper Limb from Rickets.—Bones of the left arm and shoulder girdle—macerated, to show the above. This specimen was taken from the same person as the foregoing, and shows changes similar in kind but varying in degree- B. C. I. 3. M. 32. 6. 34. Distortion of the Radius from Rickets.—Radii from the same case as that from which No. 6. 31 was taken. The bones are bent forward about the middle, and there is a great hollow on the anterior surface, at the junction of the upper and middle thirds, caused by an undue prominence of the ridges on either side, and by the bending forward of the bone at this spot. The upper ends of the bone are rotated out- wards, hence the bicipital tubercle looks directly forwards. The lower end of the bone is relatively enlarged, but the bones are otherwise stunted. B. C. i. 3. M. 30. . 35. Distortion of the Ulna from Rickets.—Left ulna (head wanting) from the same case as the preceding—macerated, showing the above. The bone is stunted in length and thickness ; the upper end is relatively enlarged, and is bent inwards from the rest of the shaft. The articular surfaces are diminished in size and altered in shape, as if movement at the elbow had been limited. B. C. i. 3. M. 30.

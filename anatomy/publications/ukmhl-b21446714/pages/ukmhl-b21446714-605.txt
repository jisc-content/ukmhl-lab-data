573 Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1889. Distortions from Injury. entirely on the balls of his toes. An ulcer, which formed below the heel, had given him so much trouble, that he wished the foot amputated. " The bones were atrophied and fatty, see No. 6. 15. The skin over the forepart of the foot and toes is coarse. The papillae are enlarged, especially on the second toe, which has a club-shaped extremity, and a very warty surface. G. C. 2818. Presented by P. H. MacLaren, F.R.C.S.E., 1888. 11. 7. Distortion of Foot by Compression.—Plaster cast of the right foot of a Chinese lady, showing distortion, artificially produced. The four outer toes are doubled under the sole. The metatarsal and central tarsal bones are forced upwards, so that the ball of the great toe nearly touches the heel, and the usual arch of the foot is now represented by a narrow cleft in front of the heel. The bones generally, but especially the tarsal bones, have evidently been stunted in their growth. G. C. 3534. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1893. 11. 8. Hand distorted from Injury to the Ulnar Nerve. —Plaster of Paris cast of a right hand, illustrating the above. By a machinery accident, 5£ years before the cast was taken, the hand and forearm of the patient, a woman, had been severely lacerated, and the thumb destroyed. Her hand remained from that time stiff, powerless, and very painful, and gradually assumed this shape. The exaggerated extension of the first phalanges, with flexion of the last two, is, as Duchenne pointed out, due to atrophy of the intrinsic muscles of the palm, following paralysis of the ulnar nerve. The deformity is known as "main au Griffon," or "Claw hand." G. C. 3111.

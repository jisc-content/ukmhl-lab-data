K". 7. 2. 4. Cancellous and Compact Tissue.—A small section of a bone—macerated and dried—to show the compact shell and cancelli in the interior. B. C. 1. N. 9. 2. 5. Cancellous Tissue.—A section of the lower end of the tibia—macerated and in spirit—to show the arrangement of the cancelli. "W". C. F. 107. 2. 6. Arrangement of Cancellous Plates in the Head and Neck of Femur and Os Innominatum.—Section of the upper part of the femur and os innominatum—macerated and dried—to show the cancelli. It will be seen that at the upper end the lamella? form the figure of a Gothic arch, and that they radiate from the head towards the great trochanter on the one hand and towards the under surface of the neck on the other. W. C. F. 9. 2. 7. Arrangement of Cancelli in the Head of a Tibia.- Section of a tibia—macerated and dried to show the cancelli. A line of bone running across the section shows the point of union of the epiphysis. W. C. F. 11. 2.8. Cancellous and Compact Tissue of Humerus.— Vertical section of a right humerus, apparently of an elderly person—macerated and dried—to show the internal structure of the W- G. C. 2135.

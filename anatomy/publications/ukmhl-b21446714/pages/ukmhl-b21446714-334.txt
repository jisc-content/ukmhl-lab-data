302 Diseases of Bone. and roughened by marks of numerous blood-vessels. Corre- sponding to the deficiency on the outside, there is a smooth necrosed portion of the inner table perforated by the trephine, and surrounded by a raised margin of thickened bone. It is triangular in shape, and leading from the apex of the triangle, and parallel with the coronal suture, is a deep groove upon a raised ridge of bone. In the absence of any clinical history the explanation of those appearances, which differ from those of most of the ordinary specimens of syphilitic disease of the cranium, is difficult.

From the vertex forwards the changes are more and more marked. Except on the necrosed part in front, and on the margins round it, the irregularities of the roughened surface have all been smoothed over. Some smoothing over is per- ceptible, even on the necrosed part itself, from which it would appear that the necrosis had resulted from a recrudence of the disease after the subsidence of a former attack. About the level of the frontal eminences a mass of very irregular, apparently necrosed bone is in process of separation. It measures two and a half inches by one and three-quarter inches and lies obliquely across the forehead. The groove round'it penetrates the thickness of the skull completely at the upper and left parts, and in places below, but on the right side the groove does not go deeper than the diploe. For the most part the edges of the grooves overhang the dead part. On the inside there is likewise a groove round the dead part and this aspect of it is as rough and irregular as the outer one' There are marks of increased vascularity all over the interior of the vault, but especially in front.

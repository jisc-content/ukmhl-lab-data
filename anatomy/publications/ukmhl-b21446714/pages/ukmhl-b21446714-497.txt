Tubercular Ostitis involving Hip-joint. 465 The whole bone is light and soft, and the channels for blood-vessels are enlarged. The articular surface of the aceta- bulum is rarefied and partially absorbed, and the interior of the bone is filled with adipocere. G. C. 3642. 7. 100. Tubercular Synovitis, involving- the Head of the Femur.—Vertical transverse section of the head and neck of a left femur—macerated. The patient, a young man, had suffered from symptoms of hip- joint disease for some time, and the head and the great trochanter were excised. The articular surface is rarefied and rough all over. In addition, the upper part of the head is greatly absorbed, pro- bably from the disease there being aided by pressure. G. C. 3462. Presented by John Duncan, F.K.C.S.E. b. Changes primarily or chiefly in the bone. 7. 101. Tubercular Arthritis, with Destruction of the Head Of the Femur.—Upper end of the right femur of a child —in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient was a girl, aged four, who died in the Eoyal Hospital for Sick Children, from disease of the hip-joint. The great and smaU trochanters were completely separated from the shaft during life. The bone was therefore presumed to be dislocated, from the amount of displacement which was observed on moving the limb. The head has disappeared. G. C. 2663 Presented by R.

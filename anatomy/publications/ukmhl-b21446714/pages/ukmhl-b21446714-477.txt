445 Tubercular Synovitis of Knee-joint. 7. 45. Invasion of Articular Surfaces from Tubercular Synovitis.—Articular end of a right femur. The cartilaginous surface is bare and rough, except at one place in front of the inner condyle. Some new periosteal bone has formed above the articular surfaces, and tbere has been a small erosion at the attachment of the popliteus muscle. B. C. ii. M. 32. 7. 46. Invasion of Articular Surfaces from Tubercular Synovitis.—Lower third of a left femur. There is roughness from rarefaction on the greater part of the articular surface. New periosteal bone has been formed above the articular end. Y. P. C. 766. 7.47. Invasion of Articular Surfaces from Tubercular Synovitis.—Lower end of a left femur. The articular surface is almost entirely rough from rare- faction and erosion. New periosteal bone has been formed in the neighbourhood. Y. p, c. 767. 7. 48. Invasion of Articular Surfaces from Tubercular Synovitis.—Articular ends of a left femur and tibia. The articular surfaces of both bones are everywhere rough from rarefaction, and, at many places, are eroded. Very little new periosteal bone has been formed in the neighbourhood. F. P. C. 773. 7. 49. Invasion of Articular Surfaces from Tubercular Synovitis.—Upper third of a left tibia. The articular surface, especially of the inner tuberosity is * 5

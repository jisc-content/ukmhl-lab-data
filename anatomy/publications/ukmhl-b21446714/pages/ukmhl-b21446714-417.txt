Leeches, blisters, yeast cataplasms with sweet oil, were applied before her admission, without any effect. "On the 17th the limb was amputated about the middle of the thigh the limb being removed, and the vessels secured by ligatures. The edfies* of the stump were brought together and secured in apposition by adhesive strap and bandage. "The patient did well at first after the operation, but about 20th October the surface of the stump gradually opened, and a fungus of a greenish colour and foul character protruded. The inguinal glands bein^ diseased, she was considered incurable, and dismissed accordingly. "On dividing the tumour longitudinally, by sawing through the lower end of the femur, patella, and head of the tibia, the end of the femur appeared softened and somewhat enlarged, with a fungoid excrescence on its fore part The surrounding muscles are altered in appearance. The cavity of the joint was but little affected, and the cartilages entire within."

The soft parts are infiltrated behind, but there is- a semblance of a capsule in front. G. C 773 Presented by Sir George Ballingall. 6.451. Central (?)

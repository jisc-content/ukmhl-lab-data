Diseases of Joints. 438 inner condyle a thin layer of gray granulations just covered the bone. The cast therefore illustrates removal of articular cartilage, and substitution of vascular granulations in its place. These may (1) develop on into bone (osseous anchylosis); or (2) into fibrous tissue (as in this case at certain parts, where it formed a fibrous covering for the articular surface) • (3) break down into- suppuration; or (4) continue to invade the bone. In this case the fibrous tissue covering part of the condyles was the effect of the organisation of granulations formed at- previous attacks. In places the granulations were recent. G. C. 2789. a. Presented by John Duncan, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 31. Tubercular Synovitis of the Knee-joint, with. Destruction of the Articular Surfaces.—Inner half of the knee from which the foregoing casts were taken—in spirit. The destruction of cartilage and its replacement by gran- ulation and fibrous tissue—now indistinguishable from the blanching and shrivelling of the spirit—are well shown. The- bone on the line of section is quite sound. G. C. 2789. b. Presented by Sous Duncan, F.R.C.S.E. 7.32. Tubercular Synovitis of the Knee-joint, with Destruction of the Articular Surfaces.—Outer half of the same knee-joint—macerated, to show the condition of the bone. The articular surface of the femur has at several places lost its firm, bony shell, and the cancellous tissue is exposed. A similar change is seen on the articular surface of the patella and femur. The adjacent texture of the bone is atrophied and

40 Injuries of Bone. Bones.—Calvarium of an elderly person—macerated—to show the fissured fracture as above. The injury was inflicted on the upper part of the cranium. On the right side the fissure has traversed the coronal suture and has then passed into the parietal bone. On the left side on the posterior part of the frontal bone there is a fissure more extensive on the inner than on the outer table. B- C- L 2" M- 3- 3. 3. Fracture of Calvarium with Sub-dural Haemorrhage.— ' Calvarium of an old person—macerated—with dura mater and blood clot between it and the bone modelled in position, in wax. The bone was trephined and the greater part of the coagulum removed with a teaspoon, but the patient died of concussion. Several fissures cross the course of the right middle meningeal artery. It must have been ruptured. B. C. 1. 2. M. 5. 3 4 Fissured Fracture of the Skull, associated with Contre-COUp.-Skull-cap-macerated-in which portions of the frontal and left parietal bones have been split. They are wired in position. The patient was working at the Forth Bridge, and fell from a height, striking his left temple. He was brought to the Infirmary, where he shortly afterwards died. . . At the post-mortem examination there was scarcely any injury to the brain on the left side, but on the right side there was great lacera- tion by contre-coup, of the temporo-sphenoidal and frontal lobes, and from this he must have died. The fractures were merely fissures until the calvarium was G.C. 2832. sawn on. Presented by Professor T. Annandale. 3. 5. Brain injured by Contre-coup.-Lower portion of the

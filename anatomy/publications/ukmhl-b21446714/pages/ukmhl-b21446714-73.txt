Fractures of the Skull. 41 brain from the foregoing case—in spirit—showing extensive laceration of the right temporo-sphenoidal and frontal lobes. As noted in the previous specimen, the injury was received on the left side. This is therefore an illustration of injury to the brain by contre-coup. The under and lateral surfaces of the temporo-sphenoidal and frontal lobes are severely lacerated on the right side, while on the left side they are apparently unharmed, except for slight superficial haemorrhages on the frontal lobe, below the points where the bone was broken. G-. C. 2831. Presented by Professor T. Annandale. 3. 6. Longitudinal Fissure of Calvarium.— Calvarium — macerated—from an elderly person, showing longitudinal fracture through the right parietal and frontal bones. The symptoms were obscure, and the fracture was not recognised during life. Apparently another fracture below the fissure has been present, but the loose piece has not been preserved. G. C. 1130. Presented by Sir Geobge Ballingall. 3. 7. Fracture of the Base of the Skull.—Skull—macerated —with a quadrant removed from the vault to show the above. The fissure, beginning in the left parietal bone, meets the lambdoidal suture, and then continues into the articulation between the occipital and temporal bones on its way to the base. The body of the sphenoid bas been fissured right across, and the sutures at the base of the skull generally are loosened. G. C. 3392. 3. 8. Fracture of the Base of the Skull.—Skull of an old

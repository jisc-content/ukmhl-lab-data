43 Fractures of the Skull. condition for about twelve hours after his admission into the Royal Infirmary. At the post-mortem examination, the fissure was found to have extended through the anterior fossa of the skull into the hard palate. The fissure begins about two inches from the lambdoidal suture near the middle on the right side, and runs forward, keeping nearly parallel to the middle line. G. C. 3113. Presented by P. H. Maclarek, F.R.C.S.E. 3.11. Fracture of the Base of the Skull.—Portion of the left half of the base of a skull—macerated—showing a fissure running from the vault into the base. The patient had fallen down a stair, and struck the right occiput as well as the left parietal bone. A slight scalp wound, not down to the bone, was all that was seen at the occiput. He was treated as an out- patient at first, but upon his becoming dull, sluggish, and comatose, and showing some blood in his left ear, he was taken into the wards, where he died four days afterwards. The fissure began on the parietal bone, and is seen extend- ing downwards into the squamous portion of the temporal bone. One part passes forwards and another continues into the foramen spinosum. This latter is more visible on the inner than on the outer aspect. There was also some injury to the roof of the tympanum, and the membrana tympani was ruptured, but there is no part of the fissure traceable into the petrous part of the temporal bone. It is of great interest to note that the membrana tympani was ruptured, and that there was bleeding from the ear, although there is no fissure to be detected in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, eyeu after maceration.

Advanced Arthritis Deformans.—Upper end of a left femur—macerated, illustrating the above. While there has been enlargement round the margin of the head of the femur, especially in front, there has been great absorption of the upper part, which thus is now below the level of the top of the great trochanter. This upper surface is fairly smooth, but has little or no eburnation, probably because locking prevented movement. The rest of the articular surface is irregular. The small trochanter has been partly absorbed. This specimen was formerly described as a united fracture of the neck of the femur. F. p- & 95- 177. Symmetrical Alterations in the Head and Neck of Femora, probably from Arthritis Deformans.—Upper portions of a right and left femur, with a vertical section of the head and neck of the left—macerated, illustrating the above. " The man, aged 50, had had several attacks of acute rheumatism. On admission to the hospital, he complained of a gnawing pain in the hip and shoulder-joints, and the motions of the hip-joint were considerably impaired. He died from exhaustion from a large lumbar abscess. He had been a shoemaker." » The shaft and trochanters were unaffected, but the neck was extremely short, and the head flattened and expanded. The acetabula were correspondingly large, shallow, and irregular. Instead of being an inch higher than the trochanter major, the highest part of the head was three-quarters of an inch lower than the trochanter. The neck was only half an inch in length, and was planted lower down on the bone, especially near the great trochanter. The margin was extended so as to form an overhanging ledge below, behind, and before. The outline of the head was flat below and arched above,

Dry Senile Gangrene. 589 11.61. Dry Senile Gangrene of Foot—Early Stage.—Foot and leg of the previous case dissected, so as to show the state of the hlood-vessels—in spirit. Both the anterior and posterior tibial arteries are atheromatous. Their coats are thickened and infiltrated with calcareous matter. Their lumen is diminished, especially that of the posterior tibial and its peroneal branch, and a portion of the posterior tibial artery is completely blocked with clot. The veins accompanying the peroneal artery are completely thrombosed, and patches of thrombosis can be seen in the posterior tibial veins. G. C. 2851. Presented by Alexander Bruce, M.D., 1888. 11. 62. Dry Senile Gangrene of Leg and Foot.—Left foot and part of the bones of the leg of an adult, dried, showing the results of dry gangrene. The man died of gangrene of the feet. The foot is shrivelled and black, and the posterior tibial vessels are by their irregularity evidently atheromatous and studded with calcareous particles. The bones have been sawn across- G. C. 354. Presented by Professor J. W. Turner. 11. 63. Blocked Vessels, which caused Dry Senile Gangrene. —The femoral artery, with its deep branch, from the same patient as the last was obtained from. The arteries have been slit up—in spirit. The coats are thickened all over, and deposits of blood clot here and there have obstructed the lumen. The cross section of the profunda shows a complete blockage. G. C. 351. 11. 64.

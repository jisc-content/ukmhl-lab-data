110 Injuries of Bone. 3. 185. Somewhat recent Extra-capsular Fracture of the Neck, without splitting- of the Great Trochanter.— Upper end of a right femur—macerated, showing the above. The specimen was taken from a subject in the dissecting-rooms. The patient had probably survived the injury for several weeks. The line of fracture is just within the capsule in front, but is outside of it behind. The lesser trochanter is wanting. New periosteal bony growth is seen on the front of the neck, especially on the lower fragment, and other evidences of periostitis can be traced for several inches down the shaft. Some absorption has taken place in the interior. The fracture has apparently been produced by a fall on the trochanter, with a force sufficient to detach the neck from the rest of the bone, and to break off the lesser trochanter, but not sufficient to split the greater trochanter by crushing it in upon the root of the neck. G. C. 2774. Presented by M'Donald Brown, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 186. Somewhat recent Impacted Extra-capsular Frac- ture Of the Neck.—Upper end of a right femur—macerated, showing the above. From the periosteal new bone thrown out at the upper end of the shaft of the femur, the patient has evidently survived the accident for several weeks. The neck has given way at its junction with the great trochanter, and the latter has been comminuted by the impaction of the neck into it. The locking of the neck into the fragments of the trochanter has been undone, probably in the preparation of the specimen. In the printed Catalogue published in 1836 this specimen was taken to be that numbered in the Bell Catalogue, i. 1. M. 18, and figured in Bell's "Observ. on the Spine and Thigh Bone," pi. viii. fig. 4. It does not however correspond to the descrip- tion of that specimen, and has been entered afresh in the G. C. as 3275.

Injuries of Bone. 50 3. 27. Fracture Of the Skull.—Fragments of bone removed in a recent case of fracture of the cranium—macerated. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 3. 28. Irregularity in the Thickness of the Skull.—"Portion cut out by the trephine "—macerated—" showing the necessity of inclining the instrument during the operation, owing to the variable thickness of the bones." B. C. 1. 2. M. 14. 3. 29. Irregularities in the Thickness of the Skull.—Skull-cap, macerated—showing fracture in the left temporal region, for which trephining had been performed. The irregularities in the thickness of the skull at the seat of operation and elsewhere are especially noteworthy. The saw, in removing the calvarium, has taken away more of the left than of the right side. B. C. 1. 2. M. 4. COMMINUTED ERACTUEES OF THE SKULL, WITH EISSUKES LEADING EEOM THEM. 3. 30. Depressed Fracture, with Fissures and Separation Of Sutures.—Skull-cap, apparently of a young subject- macerated—showing the above. There has been a depressed fracture at the lower and anterior part of the left parietal bone, and the trephine has been applied, evidently to permit elevation of the fragments. Longitudinal fissures more extensive on the inside pass back- wards and forwards from the seat of injury. The coronal suture has been forced apart for about two inches on either side of the middle line, and beyond that point on the right side, the line of separation has been continued as a fracture passing through the right parietal bone. F. P. C, 23. Presented by Professor James Russell.

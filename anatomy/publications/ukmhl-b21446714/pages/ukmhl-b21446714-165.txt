Fractures of the Femur. 133 irregular, and has left more of the bone above the outer than above the inner condyle. G. C. 2475. Presented by W. A. Finlay, F.R.C.S.E., 1876. 3. 246. Compound Comminuted Fracture of the Lower Ends Of the Condyles.—Lower end of the right femur of an old woman—macerated, showing the above. The knee was crushed between a cart-wheel and a wall. The patient was about 60 years of age, and lived six weeks after the accident, when she died from diseased aorta producing hydro-thorax. The condylar portion of the bone has been broken off from the shaft, and an oblique fissure has separated the inner and a small piece of the outer condyle from the rest of the condylar fragment. There has been an extensive formation of new periosteal bone upon the lower end of the shaft, but only a slight amount upon the lower fragments. The appearance of this new periosteal bone indicates septic irritation. It is probable, therefore, that the fracture has been compound. F. P. C. 137. Presented by Professor J. W. Turner and A. Watson, Esq. . 247. Fracture through the Condyles, followed by Sar- coma.—Inner half of the bones forming the right knee-joint —muscles dissected off, in spirit, showing the above. The fracture has been oblique from behind downwards and forwards. The lower end of the upper fragment has protruded into the front of the knee-joint. Between the fragments soft material is seen which in some places is fibrous, and in others is "fungus haematodes" (sarcoma). B. C. i. 1. M. 33. b. . Separation of the Lower Epiphysis of the Femur,

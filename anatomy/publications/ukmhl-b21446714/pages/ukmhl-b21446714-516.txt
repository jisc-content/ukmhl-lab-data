484 Diseases of Joints. 7. 151. Tubercular Disease of the Wrist, involving' the Carpus. Lower ends of the radius and ulna, and bones of the wrist—macerated, showing extensive changes. " Case where an incurable caries affecting all the bones forming the wrist-joint rendered the removal of the limb necessary, in order to save the life of the patient. The disease was most extensive, and had lasted for a very con- siderable period, the patient availing himself of all sorts of advice. The bones, as now macerated and put up, show the extent of the disease. The phalanges of the fingers were even altered in structure, being so soft as to admit of a delicate soft wire being thrust through them in all directions." Much new bone has been thrown out on the dorsal and palmar aspects of the carpus and radius, with rarefaction and absorption of the articular surfaces. G. C. 1196. 7. 152. Tubercular Disease of the Wrist, destroying- the Carpus.—Lower ends of a right radius and ulna and bones of the wrist—macerated, illustrating the above. The patient was an elderly gentleman, whose arm was amputated. Most of the carpal bones have disappeared, and those that remain are irregular, owing to new periosteal bone formation on their dorsal and palmar surfaces, and to erosion of their articular surfaces. The lower end of the radius is similarly affected and so is that of the ulna, but to a less extent. B. C. ii. M. 57. c. Spontaneous cure after tubercular disease of the wrist. 7. 153. Anchylosis after Tubercular Disease of the Wrist- Lower end of a left radius with adjacent carpal and three inner metacarpal bones, anchylosed into a common mass-macerated. There has evidently been absorption of parts of the bones, and the case has no doubt therefore been one of cured tubercular W. C. H. 46. disease.

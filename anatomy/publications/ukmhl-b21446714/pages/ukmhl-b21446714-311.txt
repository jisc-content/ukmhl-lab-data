Seqiicstrct after Necrosis from Septic Wounds. 279 "A very considerable portion more came away, but it was so soft and pliable that it would not preserve." This specimen shows characters similar to the last. G. C. 1157. 6.198. Sequestrum formed by a First Phalanx from Septie Osteo-myelitis due to Whitlow. It was from a left index finger, and was "removed by operation in a case of paronychia." The specimen is partly eroded on the anterior surface, and has a slight crust of new bone upon the back. G.

Sequestrum of Lower Jaw due to Septic Osteo- myelitis following' Injury.â€”Greater portion of the right half of the body of the lower jaw of a boy, and a piece of clay pipe stem, to illustrate the above. The boy was smoking a cutty pipe. His father in trying to knock it out of his mouth drove the stem into the jaw, where a portion broke oflf and remained unobserved. Inflammation and suppuration supervened and eventually the large sequestrum shown became loose. Professor James Miller removed it, and found within it the piece of pipe stem which is now mounted along with it. The specimen shows at many places the irregularities associated with the process of separation. G. C. 3187. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 200. Sequestrum from the Skull due to Septic Osteo- myelitis following- Fracture (Compound ?). The bone shows the mark of a trephine. Both tables are smooth on the inner surface, but the one has been more ex- tensively absorbed than the outer. The margins of both plates are very irregular, and the diploe has been absorbed for some way between them. jr P. C 482 * Presented by John Thomson, F.R.C.S.E.

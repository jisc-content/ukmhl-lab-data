135 Fractures of the Patella. on his head, his foot slipped, and in the attempt to recover himself the actions of the muscles of the thigh pressed the popliteal artery against the projecting point of bone, and the artery was ruptured, and an aneurism was formed. It was found necessary finally to amputate the limb. (For the remainder of the case, see the series illustrating arterial disease.) The epiphysis has been united to the lower end of the shaft, with its back part projecting downwards, and its inferior parts looking forwards. The lower end of the shaft projects behind the epiphysis, and is rough and irregular. Although the epiphysis and the shaft are in bad position, the union between them has been exceedingly solid. (Figured in Bell's "Observations on Injuries of the Spine and Thigh-Bone," plate iv. fig. 3.) B. C. i. 1. M. 9. FEACTUEES OF THE PATELLA. 3.250. United Transverse Fracture of the Patella.— Patella—macerated, showing the above. There has been a longitudinal break on the inner side, and another extending transversely from the middle of the first. No new bone has been formed on the joint surface, and only a little on the outer surface. This fracture has probably been caused by direct violence.

United Irregular Fracture of the Patella.— Patella—macerated, showing the above. There is a deep longitudinal fissure on the articular surface, and considerable irregularity on the anterior surface. This has probably been a fracture by direct violence. B. C. i. 1. M. 62. 3. 252. Ununited Transverse Fracture of the Patella.— Patella—muscles cleaned off and in spirit, showing the above.

258 Diseases of Bone. case of new bone. This is deficient along the front, and not well formed anywhere. The surface of the sequestrum has been blackened. B. C. i. 5. M. 38. 6. 130. Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis of the Tibia- Necrosis.—Eight tibia—macerated, illustrating the above. There has been more or less complete necrosis of the shaft from end to end. The sequestrum has been separated from the remains of the original bone, and new periosteal bone has been developed round it. The new shell, however, is so imperfect that the greater part of the sequestrum is exposed. There is an oval aperture with rounded margins low down on the inner side of the new case, the nature of which is obscure; possibly it was made by a surgeon. B. C. i. 5. M. 42. 6. 131. Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis of the Tibia- Necrosis, Imperfect Regeneration, Enlargement of the Fibula.—Right fibula and portions of tibia of a young person —macerated, illustrating the above. "The disease had affected the leg for nine years." Amputation was performed with success. " The lower part of the tibia had become soft and spongy ; the periosteum was much thickened at the diseased parts ; there was extensive ulceration of the soft parts." A portion, nearly three inches in length, is wanting from the lower end of the shaft of the tibia. The upper fragment of the tibia is for the most part irregular, but the surfaces are smoothed over. The upper end of the lower fragment is much rarefied. The fibula is much thickened, especially near the middle, by irregular deposits of bone on the surface. Opposite the deficiency in the tibia, however, the surface of the fibula is rarefied and has been partly absorbed. Probably in this case there has originally been septic osteo- myelitis and necrosis, followed by a foul-spreading ulcer. This

Fracture of the Pelvis. 103 FRACTURE OF THE PELVIS. 3. 165. United Fracture through the Ala of the Ilium.— Pelvis of an adult man—macerated, showing the above. The ala of the left ilium has been broken across, and there has been a great deposit of new bone along the line of fracture. B. C. i. 1. M. 1. FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. 3. 166. Attachment of the Capsule of the Hip Joint to the Femur.—Upper end of a femur—muscles dissected off— in spirit, showing the above. The reflected portions of ligament which run along the neck towards the head are well shown. They carry blood- vessels, hence, when they are torn through in intra-capsular fracture, the nutrition of the upper fragment is seriously impaired. G. C. 3552. Presented by Johnson Symington, F.R.C.S.E., 1893. 3.167. Structure of the Upper End of the Femur- Transverse section through the upper end of a femur—macerated, showing the above. This view shows the relations of the neck as bearing upon impaction. G. C. 3553. Presented by Johnson Symington, F.R.C.S.E., 1893. 3.168. Recent Intra capsular Fracture of the Neck.— Upper part of the left femur of an adult—macerated, showing the above. The line of fracture is very irregular, and several pieces of bone are wanting along its anterior and upper part. The outer fragment seems to. have been impacted into the inner or head

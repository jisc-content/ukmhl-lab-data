Diseases of Bone. 260 At the upper end the necrosis has extended to the epi- physes, hut at the lower end the line of separation has been a little above the epiphysis. G. C. 3308. Presented by A. Neve, F.R.C.S.E., Cashmir. 6.135. Sequestrum, after Acute Suppurative Osteo- myelitis of the Humerus.—Upper end of the shaft of the humerus of a boy, illustrating the above. The boy was a coinb-maker, and one of the combs which he made after his recovery is mounted along with the specimen. The necrosis has involved the entire thickness of the upper end. The line of separation is somewhat oblique. G. C. 3355. 6. 136. Sequestrum, after Acute Suppurative Osteo- myelitis Of the Femur.—Portion of the lower end of the shaft of a young person's femur, illustrating the above. The flat popliteal area, and almost the entire circumference above it, has become detached. The greater part of the surface is eroded, except at the lower end. The separation has been partly from within and partly from without. G. C. 223. 6. 137. Sequestrum, after Acute Suppurative Osteo- myelitis Of the Tibia.—Portion of the upper end of the shaft of a tibia, illustrating the above. The sequestrum comprises cancellated as well as compact tissue. The separation has taken place chiefly from within. G. C. 202. 6.138. Sequestrum, after Acute Suppurative Osteo- myelitis Of the Tibia.—Portion of the upper end of the shaft of a young child's tibia, illustrating the above. The sequestrum is irregular at the point of separation below, but higher up it is smooth, and has comprised the entire thickness of the bone, G. C. 283.

United Extra-capsular Fracture of the Neck.— Upper end of a left femur—muscles dissected off, in spirit, sh owing the above. A portion has been sawn out from the head and neck, to show the bony union. As in the previous specimen, the anterior part of the neck has been thrust in front of the upper part of the shaft. The great trochanter is splintered much in the usual way. There has been shortening and eversion. G. C. 3280. 3. 193.

United Extra-capsular Fracture of the Neck.- Anterior half of the upper end of a right femur—macerated, with a plaster cast of the posterior half of the same specimen. Four years before death, the patient, an old lady aged 71, fell on the carpet in her room, and immediately afterwards suffered from pain and powerlessness of her right limb. She was seen by Drs John Duncan and R. A. Lundie, who recognised "the usual symptoms of unimpacted extra-capsular fracture of the femur. It had none of the symptoms of H

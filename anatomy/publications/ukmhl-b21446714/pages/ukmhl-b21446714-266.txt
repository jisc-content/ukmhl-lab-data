234 Diseases of Bone. Amputation.—The outer half of the previous specimen, with the fibula—macerated, showing the above. New bone is seen to have been developing on tho surface of the shaft of both bones, but especially of the tibia. From the history of the case, it is evident that this new bone must have developed in about three weeks. There is no perceptible change in the bony texture of the medullary cavity. G. C. 3261.

Kelly, of Nos. 6.80 when fresh, to show the distribution of the pus in the medullary cavity. G- c- 35S5- l>. Where the chief changes are in the form of rarefaction and absorption, i.e. a septic form of " Caries." 6. 82. Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis of the Neck of the Femur.—Section of the upper end of the right femur of a child, showing the effects of a recent case of the above. The patient was a girl aged about eleven years, who had been brought up in the workhouse, and was delicate and ill-nourished. She developed symptoms of very acute synovitis of the hip, with great pain, following a slight injury. In a few days the pain subsided, and a large abscess formed round the hip, and projected at the back. It was opened and drained, but the child died suddenly next day, apparently from a clot in the heart. No post-mortem examination could be obtained. The specimen shows that the bone has been opened out and softened on the front of the neck within the capsule. This accounts for the synovitis, which must have been suppura- tive. Had the child lived, necrosis of the part below the upper epiphysis might have followed. G. C. 3319. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1891.

Gunshot Fractures of the Femur. 165 Femur.— Lower portion of the shaft of a femur—macerated, to illustrate the above. The knee had been completely detached by grape-shot at Waterloo. "This poor wretch was not relieved by amputation for fifteen days after the battle." The line of fracture is irregular, and two fissures run upwards for about three inches. At the seat of fracture, the bone is smooth. Eound this there is a shallow groove of separation, while beyond that the surface is rough, partly from a slight crust of new periosteal bone, and partly from the opening up of vascular pores. It is important to note the extent to which these changes have been carried in a fortnight. B. C. xvii. 41. 343. Gunshot Fracture of the Lower End of a Femur. —Lower end of a left femur—macerated, to show the above. One or two fragments have been driven into the interior. The patient was wounded at Waterloo. The marks of periostitis indicate that the patient must have waited many days before amputation was performed. The irregular growth of bone round the articular surface has been due to arthritis deformans previous to the injury. F. P. C. 237.

Fractures of the Tibia anal Fibula. 145 of bone unites the tibia and fibula at the seat of fracture. This form of mal-union is apt to occur if the heel be too much supported during treatment. W. C. G. 5. 3. 283. Badly united Fracture of both Bones near their Lower Ends.â€”Plaster cast of a right tibia and fibula, showing the above. The fracture in the fibula was four inches from the lower end, while in the tibia the fracture began about the same level, and ran obliquely backwards and downwards. The lower fragments were tilted backwards and inwards. A large amount of callus had formed round the broken tibia. The cast is taken from one in the Barclay Collection by James Richardson. G. C. 3332. 3. 284. United Fracture of both Bones near their Lower Ends.-Lower ends of a left tibia and fibula-macerated, show- ing the above. The fracture has been oblique, and the break has occurred a little higher in the tibia than in the fibula. The union has been good, except that the tibia and fibula are united together close to the ankle. B Q L j M ^ 3. 285. Ununited Comminuted Fracture of both Bones near the Lower End.-Lower third of a tibia-macerated showing the above. The lower fragment of the fibula corresponding to that of the tibia adheres to it, but the upper part of the fibula is wanting. The upper fragment of the tibia has been split by the lower one, which has been driven into it. The broken surfaces are encrusted with newly formed bone round the fracture. The bones are eroded where they have been in contact, but have been mounted slightly separate to show the relationship The fracture has probably been compound. G. C. 2780

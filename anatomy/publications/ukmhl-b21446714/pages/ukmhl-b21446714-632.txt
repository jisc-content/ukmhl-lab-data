600 The Limbs as a Whole. An amputation through the leg was required for secondary haemorrhage some weeks after the first one; the limb had been a paralysed one (see No. 6. 59.) The stump has healed well. The excellent covering for the bone afforded by the heel pad may be contrasted with that formed by the skin of the leg at the seat of election (previous specimen). G. C. 3173. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E., 1890. 11. 86. Stump after Syme's Amputation. — Parts from a recent case of Syme's Amputation—in spirit. Reampntation was required on account of sloughing of the heel flap. The posterior tibial artery was represented by only a very fine twig, and its place was taken by a large branch growing outwards from the posterior peroneal artery. Granulation tissue covers the end of both bones ; and the periosteum above the section is thickened and has been forming bone. The end of the tendo-Achillis is seen to be covered with lymph. The cut end of the posterior tibial nerve is enlarged. G. C. 2802. Presented by P. H. MacLaken, F.R.C.S.E., 1888. 11. 87. End of Bones after Syme's Amputation—Portions of the tibia and fibula from the above case—macerated. New bone is seen to be forming on the cut surface of the- tibia and on the surface of the shaft of both bones. G. C. 2802. a. Presented by P. H. MacLaiien, F.R.C.S.E., 1888. 11. 88.

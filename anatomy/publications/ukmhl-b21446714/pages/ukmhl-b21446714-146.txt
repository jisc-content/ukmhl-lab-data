The bone shows the usual appearances produced by a slight amount of impaction of the neck upon the trochanters, i.e. some thickening at the front of the neck and some splitting at the back of the great trochanter. The eversion must have been very slight, and there seems to have been no shortening at all, possibly owing to the extension used in the treatment.

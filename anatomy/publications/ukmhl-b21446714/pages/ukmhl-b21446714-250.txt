The bone is slightly stunted, and has at its upper end a curve which projects outwards. There is the usual lateral flat- tening of the curve, with development of bone in its concavity. The inner condyle projects unduly downwards as if from knock-knee. B. C. I. 3. M. 35. 6. 44. Distortion of the Femur from Rickets.—Right femur of an adult—macerated, showing the above. The shaft is stunted, and has a forward and outward curve at its upper part. The angle which the neck forms with the shaft is obtuse, and the head has been on the same level as the top of the great trochanter. The inner condyle projects downwards unduly as if from knock-knee. W. C. G. 23. 45. Distortion of the Femur from Rickets.—Right femur of an adult—macerated, to show the above. There is a somewhat S-shaped curve of the shaft. The projection is outwards and forwards above, and inwards below, with the usual lateral flattening at the point of curvature. The inner condyle projects markedly downwards as if from knock- G. C. 361. knee. 6. 46. Distortion of the Femur from Rickets—Left femur macerated, to show above. There is a decided bend of the shaft directed inwards and forwards, and with the usual lateral flattening of the curve. The lower end of the bone is rotated outwards, and the inner condyle projects greatly downwards, as if from knock-knee The bone is soft, probably owing to senile changes. G. U dot.

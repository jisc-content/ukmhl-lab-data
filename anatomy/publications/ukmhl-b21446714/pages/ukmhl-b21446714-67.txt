35 Development of the Bones of the Lower Limb. cartilage, to deposit the bone in the centre, are beautifully seen. There is a small centre of ossification at the head, but the lower part of the bone is as yet entirely cartilaginous. The bony centre in the upper epiphysis, as well as the epiphysial end of the shaft, are seen to be extremely vascular. B. C. 1. N. 22. 2. 90.

Diseases of Bone. 38a ing this cavity was of a nature similar to the great mass of the tumour. There is little doubt that a small part of the tumour had been left, or that the muscles, tainted by the contact, bad propagated the diseased action. The diseased portion, increasing with that rapidity which characterises this sort of tumour, had destroyed the coats of the vessel, and from this sprung the haemorrhage which proved fatal. Had the tumour been entire, the blood would only have run into the interstices of its texture, but being open and upon the face of the stump, the blood had free egress. The cavity on the stump was in all respects similar to that found in the centre of the tumour. " On dissecting out the head of the femur, and sawing it through and macerating it, the disease was seen to have propagated itself to the head of the bone and through the whole cancelli." The broken ends of the bone are seen over-lapping, and apparently at one or two places united by bone. The greater part of the interval between the broken ends, however, has been occupied by the tumour substance j some of it has fallen away, but what remains is soft, grey, and somewhat translucent. This material can also be seen occupying the medullary cavity above and below the seat of fracture. (See case of Phineas in Bell's "Surgical Observations and Reports," p. 376.) B. C. i. 1.

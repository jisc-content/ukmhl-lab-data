Diseases of Joints. 458 7. 81. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Inner half of the left knee of a young person—in spirit, illustrating the ahove. The specimen shows numerous scars on the skin, the result of previous abscesses, also partial dislocation of the tibia backwards, as well as development of fat in the bones and of fibrous tissue round the joint. The anchylosis is fibrous and osseous between the femur and tibia, and fibrous between the patella and the femur. G. C. 3144. Presented by Macdonald Brown, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 82. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Outer half of the previous knee-joint—macerated, illustrating the above. The front of the outer articular surface of the tibia articulates with the back of the outer condyle. The upper part of the shaft of the tibia has had a slight concavity looking forwards. The femur and tibia are seen to be anchylosed, partly by bone, but apparently mainly by fibrous tissue. The cancellous texture of the femur, tibia, and fibula is opened out into large spaces, and the trabecular are delicate and thin. G. C. 3145. Presented by Macdonald Brown, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 83. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Lower end of a left femur and patella—macerated, illustrating the above. The inferior aspect of the condylar surfaces is flattened, and the articular surface is rarefied, remains of cartilage being only seen at the back. The patella has been partially anchylosed to the trochlear surface of the femur. No new bone has been thrown out round the femur, and its texture is lightened and greasy. G. C. 373. 7. 84. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Lower end of a left femur, upper half of tibia and patella — macerated, showing partial anchylosis and unusual distortion.

307 Syphilitic Necrosis. Incites across. This piece is surrounded by a distinct trench, which below has penetrated through the skull. The sides and back of the calvarium are comparatively unchanged, but the bone is increased in thickness and the diploe is partially filled up. The vomer, nasal, lachrymal, inferior turbinated, and greater part of the ethmoid and nasal portion of superior maxillary bones have entirely disappeared. The ethmoidal sinuses and the antrum of Highmore on each side are completely exposed from the nose. The back of the palate is gone, and only a trace of the nasal septum is seen at the roof. Marks of increased vascularity are seen on the malar bones below each orbit. The back of the skull shows at various places patches of roughness owing to increased vascularity. B. C. r. 7. M. 18. . 264. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull after Separation Of a Sequestrum.—Portion of right frontal and parietal bones—macerated, illustrating the above. In front there is an aperture with rounded margins, as if necrosis had separated and the part healed. Behind that, and separated from it by a bridge of bone, is another aperture, more irregular and with sharper margins, as if a sequestrum had only recently separated from it. On the inside there are marks of increased vascularity, old-standing in front and recent behind. Near the apertures the bone is irregular and eroded in both aspects, but this surrounding irregularity does not correspond on the two aspects. W. C. G. 46. 265. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull after Separation Of a Sequestrum.—Portion of the left half of a calvarium— macerated, illustrating the above. There is an irregular aperture in the parietal bone, about three inches in diameter each way. The margins of this aperture are sharp, and a large sequestrum must have only recently separated from it.

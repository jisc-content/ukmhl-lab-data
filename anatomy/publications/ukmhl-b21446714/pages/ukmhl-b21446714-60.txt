Development of the Bones. 28 2. 53. Ossification at ElbOW—Preparation of both elbows of a child at birth—injected with vermilion and in spirit. Ossifica- tion has not yet begun in the cartilaginous epiphyses. B. C. 1. N. 37. 2, 54. Ossification Of Humerus.—Humerus—injected with ver- milion and in turpentine—from a child 2 or 3 years old. In the upper epiphyses two centres of ossification are seen; in the lower epiphyses as yet only one. The cartilaginous portions of the epiphyses at either end are shrunken, but they are translucent and show the blood-vessels penetrating into them. B. C. 1. N. 36. 2. 55. Ossification Of Humerus-—Humerus of a child—macerated and dried—showing the position of the various epiphyses. The epiphyses at the upper end have united into one, which, however, has not yet united to the shaft. At the lower end, there is a separate epiphysis for the outer condyle, for the capitellum and adjacent part of the trochlea, and for the remainder of the trochlea, but that for the inner condyle has been lost in the process of maceration. G. C. 3528. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1893. 2. 56. Ossification at the Head of Humerus.—Sections of the upper end of the right humerus of a patient aged 20 years- cleaned and in spirit—showing the epiphysial ossification nearly completed. The line of the epiphysial junction is seen to run irregularly between the anatomical and surgical necks. In this specimen the union is complete below the head, but incomplete at the tuberosities.

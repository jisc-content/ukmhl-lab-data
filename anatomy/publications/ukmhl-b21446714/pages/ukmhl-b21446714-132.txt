Injuries of Bone. 100 3. 156. Gunshot Fracture of the Shaft of the Humerus.— Lower half of a left humerus—macerated, showing the effects of septic osteo-myelitis following the above. The patient was a soldier who was wounded at Waterloo. The bone at the seat of fracture has necrosed, and has been in process of separation. Lower down the opening up of the vascular channels shows that there has been inflammation of the periosteum, although not with the formation of any new F. P. C. 205. bone. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 3 157. Gunshot Fracture of the Shaft of the Humerus.- Portion of a humerus-macerated, showing the effects of the above. The patient was a soldier who fought at Waterloo. There has evidently been septic osteo-myelitis. A portion of the bone, smoother and whiter than the rest, has necrosed. At other places new bone has been thrown out from the broken surface of the bone, from the periosteum, and in the medullary F. P. C. 204. cavity. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 3 158. Old-standing Gunshot Fracture of the Lower End ' of the Humerus.-Lower end of a left humerus-macerated, showing the effects of the above. The wound was received at Waterloo by a soldier who fought there. He sank exhausted by hectic fever and diarrhoea thirteen months after the "^This specimen was figured in Hennen's " Military Surgery," 2nd edition, plate i. fig. 3, as an illustration of the bad effects of the impaction of a fragment of bone into the medulla; also of Nature's attempt to bridge over the injured part by new bone formation. The features of the specimen would, however, be now explained by septic inflammation of the bone and soft parts, with subsequent reparative changes.

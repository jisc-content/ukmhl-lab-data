The lower end of the humerus is so greatly atrophied that its original shape is not recognisable. The whole of the outer condyle, with some of the bone above it, is now wanting. Large adimentary bones have formed in the synovial membrane. There is a large one above the olecranon process, another at the inner condyle of the humerus, and other smaller ones are scattered round the joint. The articular surfaces of the joint show smooth exposed bone at some places. At others they are covered with a shreddy, fibrous material, but nowhere with cartilage. The synovial mem- brane, where it has been left, shows numerous processes —some pendulous and thick, and others fine and shreddy. This specimen was formerly described as one of fracture and dislocation, involving the elbow-joint, not, however, from a history of the case, but from an interpretation of the appear- ances. The view now taken, however, seems the more correct one, as the specimen quite corresponds with an extreme degree of the changes seen in other examples of arthritis deformans. G. C. 784.

The bones of the forearm have been drawn up on the out- side, past the lower end of the humerus. Although there is no history to that effect, this might have been a cast of the previous elbow-joint before dissection. It was entered as a cast of a dislocation. F- P. C. 702. 7. 195.

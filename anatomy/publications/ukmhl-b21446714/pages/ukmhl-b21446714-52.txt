Development of Bone. 20 2. 9. Cancellous Tissue in the Lower End of a Femur- Vertical sections of the lower end of a right femur—macerated and dried—to show the arrangement of the cancelli. W. C. F. 14. PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT IN GENERAL. 2. 10. Ossification in Cartilage.—A portion of the cartilage of a young elephant, beginning to ossify (apparently injected with mercury to show the blood-vessels). B. C. 1. N, 18. 2. 11. Ossification at Knee Joint—Section of the bones form- ing the knee-joint of an infant at birth—injected and in spirit— showing the process of ossification. The central nuclei of bone in the epiphysial cartilage of the femur and tibia are well seen. The patella remains quite cartilaginous. B. C. 1. 2T. 23. 2. 12. Ossification of the Lower End of Femur.—Sections of the lower end of the femur of a child—injected with vermilion and in spirit—to show the cartilage that remains between the shaft and the epiphysis until the ossification is complete. The channels for blood-vessels are seen in the ossifying cartilage. B- C. 1. K 28. 2.13. Ossification of Astragalus.—Right astragalus of a child—minutely injected and in spirit. The ossification is now complete, and the cartilage, which is now only articular, has not been at all penetrated by the injection. B- c- L N« 26-

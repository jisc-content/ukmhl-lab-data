Diseases of Joints. 464 the acetabulum a few flakes of cartilage remain, but the most of the articular surface shows bare bone. The synovial mem- brane round the acetabulum is thickened, and is shreddy on the surface. G-. C. 172. 7. 98. Tubercular (?) Synovitis, involving- the Bone.—Part of a left innominate bone and thigh bone—macerated, illustrating the above. From a patient who died of hip-joint disease. " The capsular ligament was much relaxed, the ligamentum teres was entirely destroyed, the cartilages much eroded, the acetabulum nearly filled with coagulable lymph, and the head of the femur dislodged." The articular surface of the acetabulum is rarefied and rougb, and the normal smooth layers which lie below the cartilage remains only in some places. On the upper and lateral parts of the head of the femur the bone is similarly rarefied, and also partially absorbed at the front. Above and behind the attachment of the ligamentum teres there is some eburnation of the surface, such as is seen in arthritis deformans. Round the acetabulum there has been a considerable deposit of new bone. A small deposit of new periosteal bone is seen on the under side of the neck of the femur. The eburnation on the head of the femur points to arthritis deformans, while the new growth round the acetabulum resembles that due to septic irritation; the rarefaction and "flakesof coagulable lymph "may have been tubercular. Possibly, therefore, arthritis deformans has been followed by tuberculosis, and this has led to an abscess, which, after bursting, has become 7. 99. Tubercular Synovitis, involving* the Acetabulum.

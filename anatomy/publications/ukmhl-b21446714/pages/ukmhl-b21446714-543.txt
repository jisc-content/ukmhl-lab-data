Lateral Curvature of the Spine. 511 of the angles of the rihs on the concave side is masked by the compression of the ribs together. The compression of the left side of the chest, and opening out of the right side, must have produced a corresponding depression of the left shoulder, and elevation of the right one. B. C. i. 3.

The first curve, beginning from above, is towards the right side, and has its maximum about the fourth dorsal vertebra. The second curve is towards the left side, and reaches its maximum at the tenth dorsal vertebra. When viewed from behind, the curvature seems to begin about the third dorsal vertebra, and extends from that part downwards towards the left. B. C. I. 3. M. 5.

Advancing1 Lateral Curvature.—Cervical, dorsal, and upper lumbar portion of a spine, with the ribs attached— macerated, illustrating the above. There is a curve to the left in the cervical and upper dorsal region, having its maximum at the third dorsal vertebra. There is also a very slight curve to the right in the lower dorsal vertebra?, reaching its maximum about the ninth vertebra. There is a slight rotation of the vertebra? towards the con- vexity of the upper curve, and, in consequence, the upper ribs on the left side are raised and separated, and have their angles projected backwards, while the corresponding ribs on the opposite side have their angles flattened, and their shafts thrown together and depressed. In the lower ribs the angles are somewhat increased on the right side, and flattened on the left, corresponding to the alternating convexity of the curve. B. C. i. 3. M. 19.

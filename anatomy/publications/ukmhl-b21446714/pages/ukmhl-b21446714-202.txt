Injuries of Bone. 170 —macerated, to show the above. The epiphyseal line is stilt visible. " The ball passed through the head of the tibia, and must have broken upon the continuity of the capsular membrane; but this man got so well as to have been brought up to Yoik Hospital for the purpose of being examined for a pension* when irritation and inflammation commenced, which made it neces- sary to amputate " (Sir Charles Bell). The bullet has perforated, without splitting, the front of the head. New bone has been formed round the openings, especially on the outer side, and also on the front of the tibia for about three inches below the injured spot. There is a slight deposit on the head of the fibula. B. C. xvn. 30i 3. 356. Bullet lodged in the Upper End of the Tibia,, fol- lowed by acute Osteo-myelitis and Necrosis of the Shaft.—Upper two-thirds of the right tibia of a young adult (epiphyseal line still visible)—macerated, to show the above-. The wound was received at the battle of Waterloo. Abscess and caries made amputation necessary. The bullet, which is a round one, is lodged intact m a large cavity in the cancellous tissue at the back of the upper end of the bone. On the front of the shaft a large part of the compact tissue has necrosed. This dead piece has been partially separated above, while below its surface has- been partly absorbed by granulations, and is in consequence very rough. A piece cut out of it shows that the separation was also" proceeding from below. The rest of the shaft, especially at the back, is encrusted with new periosteal bone. Apparently,, therefore, an acute osteo-myelitis following the injury produced by the bullet has ended in necrosis. B. C. xvn. 32.. 3. 357.

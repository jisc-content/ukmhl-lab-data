138 Injuries of Bone. the femur—injected and in spirit. The soft parts are cleaned off. There is an oblique fracture extending from before back- wards through the upper part of the shaft of the tibia, and a split has extended upwards through the outer tuberosity into the articular surface. The knee-joint shoAvs signs of an early stage of arthritis deformans. F. P. C. 2966. 3.262. Comminuted and Impacted Fracture of the Tibia, involving- the Knee-joint —comparatively recent.—-Upper end of a right tibia and fibula—macerated, showing the above, which resembles the previous specimen. The patient died of erysipelas six weeks after the accident. The outer tuberosity has apparently been forced down- wards, and has been partly detached from the rest of the bone. The shaft has given way obliquely from without downwards and inwards at the level of the tubercle. The lower fragment has evidently been forced upwards, for several pieces of bone are embedded in the upper fragment behind, while on the outer side of both fragments small pieces of bone have been everted. These injuries seem as if they might have been produced either by a fall on to the foot with the leg extended and the main pressure directed upon the outer side of the knee-joint, or by a severe wrench tending to bend the knee-joint inwards, i.e. as if to produce knock-knee.

Lower portions of a left tibia and fibula—macerated, showing the above, with the fragments wired together. "The injury was compound. The knee-joint was in this case pre- served to the patient, although the fracture involved nearly the whole of the tibia ; indeed, the fibula was entirely removed." The bones have been severely comminuted. G. C. 1129, Presented by James PlTOAiRtf, F.R.C.S.E.

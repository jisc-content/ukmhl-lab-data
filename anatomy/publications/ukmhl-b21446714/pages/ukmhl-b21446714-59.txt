Development of the Bones of the Upper Limb. 27 2. 48. Development of Upper Limb.—Skeleton of the arm of a foetus between third and fourth month—in spirit. B. C. 1. 1ST. 91. 2. 49. Development of Upper Limb.—Skeleton of right upper limb of an infant at birth—macerated—showing the relative amount of each bone developed at this stage. Prepared by Yasseur, Paris. G. C. 3545. Presented by Chakles "W. Cathcakt, F.R.C.S.E., 1893. 2. 50. Development Of Scapula.—Scapula of an infant—injected and in turpentine—showing the bony and cartilaginous portions. There is an epiphysis in the coracoid process, but no bone is as yet deposited in the cartilaginous epiphysis at the glenoid cavity, the acromion process, and the vertebral border. B. C. 1. N. 55. 2. 51. Development Of Scapula.—Scapula of a young person, said to have been 15 years of age—macerated and dried. The coracoid process has not yet united, and the cartilagin- ous extremities of the acromion process, glenoid cavity, and vertebral border have disappeared in the process of maceration. G. C. 3543. Presented by Charles "W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1893. 2. 52. Ossification of Humerus.—A section of the humerus in early life—injected and in turpentine—to show the process of ossification in it. The cartilage has shrivelled, but one small centre of ossification is shown for the head and another for the greater tuberosity. The lower end of the bone is as yet entirely cartilaginous. B. C. 1.

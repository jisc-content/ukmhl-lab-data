Fracture through the tenth Dorsal Vertebra in an Old Man.—Portion of the ninth and the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae—the muscles cleaned off, dried and partly varnished, to show the above condition. The spine had previously been anchylosed, and therefore would not bend. The fracture has passed irregularly through the body, lamina, and spinous processes. The bony masses which had produced the previous anchylosis are seen on either side of the front of the bodies (Arthritis deformans). See Bell's "Observ. on Injury of the Spine and Thigh Bone," plate fig- L B. C. 1. 4. M. 14. 3 83. Dislocation forwards of the tenth, and Fracture of the Body of the eleventh Dorsal Vertebrae.-Section through the bodies and lamina? of the lower part of the sixth and of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, and part of the eleventh dorsal vertebras, to show the canal from the front. The muscles are dissected off—in spirit. The body of the tenth vertebra has been displaced for- wards and downwards, and has crushed a fragment from the upper and back part of the eleventh vertebra back upon the spinal cord, so as to bruise and compress it. An irregular fracture is seen running through the body of the eleventh vertebra. This specimen was used by Sir Charles Bell as an argument for the uselessness of trephining the spine after injury.

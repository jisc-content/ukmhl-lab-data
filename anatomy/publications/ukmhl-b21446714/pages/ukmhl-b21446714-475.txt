Tubercular Synovitis of Knee-joint. 443 condyle there is a piece of the smooth necrotic hone so often seen in advanced cases of tubercular arthritis. G. C. 1231. Presented by Sir George Ballingall. 7. 40. Tubercular Synovitis involving" the Bone.—Cast in glue and glycerine of a knee-joint laid open after amputation for the above. ' The patient, a boy T.M., aged 14, had been troubled for three years .before admission to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, with his knee. For the last two years there had been swelling, but very little pain. When admitted, seven weeks before the amputation, the joint was uniformly enlarged with a large peri-articular abscess on the inner side. For a time after this abscess was opened, the patient did well, but the wound became septic. The temperature then rose to 103° F. and kept there. Intense pain accompanied any attempt at movement, and there were starting pains at night. Hematuria set in. Before the amputation these symptoms had somewhat subsided under free drainage, and daily syringing out the knee-joint with 1 -1000 corrosive sublimate lotion. When laid open after the amputation the joint was found to contain pus. The articular surfaces were eroded, leaving the hone bare, hut not soft. At places numerous necrosed fragments lay loose on the surface of the bone, and a cavity existed in the head of the tibia. The cast shows the narrow rim of cartilage which was left in the femur and the patella, and the irregularity of the rest of the surface covered by granulations. G. C. 2801. Presented by Charles W. Catiicart, F.R.C.S.E. 7.41. Tubercular Synovitis involving" the Bone.—Sections in spirit of parts of the knee of which the foregoing specimen is a cast. The now shrivelled and blanched (by the spirit) granula- tions on the end of the femur are well seen, also erosions by granulation tissue into the head and shaft of the tibia. An external opening into a large posterior abscess is indicated by a

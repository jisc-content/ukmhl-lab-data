Fractures of the Femur. 109 surfaces, which are alternately slightly concave and convex, are united by fibrous bands. Some new bone has been thrown out round the broken margin of the lower fragment, and a small nodule is seen at the top, attached by fibrous tissue. There is a slight amount of bony enlargement on the lower portion of the head, which constitutes the upper fragment. B. C. i. 1. M. 15. 3. 183. Ununited Intracapsular Fracture of the Neck.— Posterior half of the upper end of the left femur of an old man, muscles cleaned off—in spirit, showing the above. The case was considered by some surgeons to be one of unreduced dislocation of the femur. Sir Charles Bell in consultation confirmed the diagnosis of fracture of the neck of the femur, and this was afterwards verified by post-mortem examination. The patient lived for two years after the accident. The capsule of the hip joint has been greatly thickened, and the neck of the bone has been almost entirely absorbed. Fibrous tissue unites the broken surfaces which are flattened. The cartilage covering the head of the bone shows the changes usually found in arthritis deformans. Figured in Bell's " Observations on Injuries of Spine and Thigh Bone," plate viii. fig. 1. B. C, i. 1. M. 19. 3. 184. Ununited Intra-capsular Fracture of the Neck.— Left half of the pelvis of an adult, with the head of the femur fixed in the acetabulum—macerated, to show the above. The portion of the femur remaining includes only part of the head, but possibly the bone was absorbed after the fracture. The exposed surface, somewhat irregular in outline, is for the most part smooth and condensed. Around the acetabulum new bone has been formed at one or two places. There are fissures on the ilium, but these may have been made post mortem. Q, qm 1013.

MacLaren, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 42. Tubercular Synovitis involving- the Bone.—Portion of the head of the tibia from the previous case—macerated. It shows the eroded spaces on the head of the tibia. There is no periosteal new bone. G. C. 2801. b. Presented by P. H. MacLaren, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 43. Advanced Tubercular Synovitis in a Child.—Section of the knee-joint of a child—in spirit, to illustrate the above. The bones were softened and the knee flexed. The speci- men, however, does not show much now. G. C. 2168. Presented by Benjamin Bell, jun., F.R.C.S.E.

Invasion of Articular Surfaces from Tubercular Synovitis.—-Bones of a left knee-joint from a case of tuber- cular synovitis. The articular surface has been attacked in the neighbour- hood of the inter-condyloid notch, and at the back of both condyles, the outer especially. The bone is somewhat roughened on the side of the inner condyle, and slightly eroded upon the front of the outer condyle, but there is little change in the substance of the bone itself, which is very dense and heavy. The articular surface of the tibia is scarcely altered, but at places the bone is somewhat roughened. G. C. 733. Presented by Sir George Ballingall.

351 Osseotcs Tumours. an enormous fungating tumour of the upper part of the humerus. Although this is described in the Bell Catalogue merely as the cast of a fungus tumour of the humerus, it has probably been taken from the previous case. It resembles the drawing by John Bell very closely, and corresponds to his description. B. C. i. 6. M. 3. B. Osseous and Connective-Tissue Tumours—ranging from the slowly-growing simple forms whose tissues are well devel- oped, to the rapidly-growing malignant forms whose tissues are more or less embryonic. (a.) From the Periosteum and Bone. 6.373. Ossification of Muscles of the Thigh ("Myositis Ossificans").—Upper end of a right femur and adjacent portion of pelvis—macerated, illustrating the above. From the margin of the obdurator membrane a sharp spicule of bone, one and a half inches in length, points directly to the insertion of the obturator externus muscle, and has evidently developed the ossification of some of its fibres. Below it, attached to the ascending ramus of the ischium, is a large irregular mass of bone which must have occupied the position of part of the obturator externus and adductor magnus muscles. The outer side of the tuber ischii is nodular. The spine of the ischium is irregular and jagged. The remaining portions of the ischium and as much of the ilium as is present are rough on the surface. On the back of the upper end of the femur there is a mass of rough spongy bone corresponding to the position of the quad- ratus femoris muscle; and below the small trochanter an irregular mass of similarly spongy bone arises from the inner surface of the shaft, and occupies a space from above downwards of about four inches, representing, apparently, ossification in the vastus internus and adjacent adductor muscles. This mass of bone is perforated by large sinuses, apparently the position of blood-

Preface. xiii when possible, by others, illustrating spontaneous cure, and lastly, by those which show the results of operations. Among Tumours a study of the clinical history and naked- eye appearances seems a better foundation for their arrangement in a Museum than their microscopical characters. Consequently, the Tumours of any particular tissue or organ will be found to range from the simple, well-developed, slow-growing forms to those which grow quickly, are undefined in structure, and are clinically malignant. The microscopical characters of any specimen have been looked upon as an adjunct to its descrip- tion rather than as an essential element in its classification. It follows, as a natural consequence from the above method of arrangement, that all the contents of the Museum which represent a certain degree of deformity, stage of disease, or kind of tumour have been grouped together. Formerly, in this as in many other Museums, spirit preparations were placed in one part of the Museum, dried preparations in another, casts in a third, and drawings in a fourth. Now, they are all classed together in the Catalogue when they belong to the same or to similar specimens. Where, owing to variations in shape and size, some of the individual members of a group could not be conveniently placed upon the shelves with the rest, every effort has been made to place them so close to the others that the student can refer to them without loss either of time, or of a sense of the general continuity. In many cases published drawings of the patients from whom the specimens were taken have been copied by photography and placed beside the specimens they illustrate.

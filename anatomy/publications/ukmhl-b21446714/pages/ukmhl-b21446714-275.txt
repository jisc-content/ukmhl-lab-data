Bone Abscess. 243 the history of the case seems to point sufficiently clearly to the agency of pus-forming organisms. G. C. 1119. Presented by Sir George Ballingall. 6. 9?_Disease of the Astragalus and Fatty Degeneration of the other Tarsal Bones, secondary to the above Condition of the Tibia.—Bones of the right foot from the same patient as the last specimen—macerated, to show the above. "The whole bones of the foot, although not showing much disease, were so extremely soft and pulpy as scarcely to admit of articulation. They could have been cut across in all directions with a common scalpel without turning its edge." The articular surface of the astragalus seems to have been affected more from the anchylosis than from the actual dis- ease. Some of the roughness on it may have been caused in process of preparation. q. q ^ 119 Presented by Sir George Ballingall. 6.100. Abscess and Chronic Ostitis in the Lower End of the Tibia.-Lower part of a right tibia in section-macerated, illustrating the above. The bone is greatly thickened, owing to new formation of cancellated tissue. The large cavity at the upper part is contmuous with the medullary canal. A small cavity seen below on the front section has its walls formed of condensed bone. This condition has apparently been the result of chronic septic osteo-myelitis in the lower end of the bone, ending in suppuration in one or two places.

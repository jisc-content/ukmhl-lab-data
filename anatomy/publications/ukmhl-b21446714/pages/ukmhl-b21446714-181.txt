United Fracture of the Shaft near its Lower End. —Lower two-thirds of a left tibia—macerated, showing the above. The line of fracture runs downwards and inwards. The ends overlap, but the union is otherwise good, except that there is an interval between the fragments at the back. Some marks of chronic periostitis are seen near the fracture. B. C. l 1. M, 46. f. 3. 297. United Fracture of the Shaft, which had an Ulcer over it.—Lower three-fourths of a right tibia—macerated, showing the above. The fragments are set at an angle, which projects slightly forwards. At the seat of fracture, at the inner side, the surface of the bone is opened out and rough, as if there had been an ulcer over it. At other places the surface shows signs of pen0Stitis- B. C. i. 1.

The fragment of the tibia has a conical lower end and is united externally to the fibula by a thick mass of new bone The lower fragment of the tibia is wanting. Note that the fibula, below its union with the tibia, is thickened, as if taking on the function of the missing fragment of the latter. B. C. r. 1. M. 46. a.

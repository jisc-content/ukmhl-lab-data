520 Diseases of Joints. rarefied. The inner aspect of the left lateral mass at the attachment of the transverse ligament is also somewhat rarefied, and the body of the axis and its odontoid process have been dis- eased, and the substance is light and opened out. The cause of death is unknown, but this is one of those cases in which there is great danger of a falling forward of the head. This causes death by drawing the medulla against the odontoid process. G. C. 823. Presented by Sir Georce Ballingall. 7. 228. Tubercular Disease, with Destruction of Bone — Upper four cervical vertebrae—macerated, illustrating the above. The patient, a girl aged sixteen years, had been affected with extensive abscesses in the neck. " She died suddenly after being attacked with difficult breathing and symptoms resembling the common catarrhal fever." The lateral masses and posterior arch of the atlas are rarefied and partially absorbed, and similar changes are seen in the body, odontoid, and upper articular processes and left half of the ring of the axis, as well as slightly on portions of the third vertebra. In all probability death has been caused by the pressure of tubercular ddbris upon the medulla oblongata. G. C. 1075. Presented by Adam Hunter, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 229. Tubercular Disease, with Destruction of Bone.— First five cervical vertebrae—macerated, illustrating the above. The greater part of the body of the axis has been destroyed, leaving only a bridge of bone, thinner on the left side, between the odontoid process and the lateral masses. There has been some new bone formation on the other vertebras, and more or less anchylosis has taken place between the second, third, fourth, and fifth vertebras. The axis has settled down in front upon the third vertebra, so that the head must have projected

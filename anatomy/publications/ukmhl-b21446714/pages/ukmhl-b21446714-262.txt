230 Diseases of Bone, 6. 73. Bony Outgrowths on the Tibia and Fibula, associated On the subcutaneous surface there is a sharply defined elevated node, the surface of which, as well as of some of the bone near it, is opened out and porous. At a little distance from the node there are some periosteal outgrowths which have a smooth surface. Probably an ulcer of the soft parts has been present over the porous surface. This specimen was formerly classified as a venereal node. B. C. I. 5. M. 15. 6. 70. Bony Outgrowths on the Tibia, associated with Chrome Ulcer Of the Legâ€”Section of a tibia, injected, and the soft parts, except the periosteum, cleaned off and dried, to shoAV the above. The surface of the bone is irregular, and has probably lain beneath an old-standing ulcer. The section shows that the com- pact tissue has been dense and even ivory-like in consistence. W. C. G. 23a. 6.71. Bony Outgrowth on the Tibia, associated with Chronic Ulcer Of the Leg.-Portion of a left tibia- macerated, to show the above. The bone is thickened on the surface, this being probably due to an ulcer of the soft parts over it. B. C. i. 5. M. 77. 6 72 Bony Outgrowths on the Tibia, associated with Chronic Ulcer of the Leg.-Upper end of a left tibia- macerated, to show the above. The bone is very light. There is considerable penostitic outgrowth on the surface corresponding to the origin of the soleus muscle. This condition was probably due to an ulcer on the soft parts, lower clown on the leg.

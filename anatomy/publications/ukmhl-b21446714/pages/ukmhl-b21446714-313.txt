Tubercular Caries. 281 negro, with portion of overlying skin—in spirit, to illustrate the above. A sinus shown in the skin communicated " with a vomica of the lungs."

Tubercular Disease of the Sternum.—Manubrium and part of the body of a sternum—macerated, illustrating the above. An abscess, probably tubercular, "had formed beneath the ■sternum."

There is a large irregular erosion on the upper surface about the middle. The walls of this excavation are rarefied! and the bone in front is reduced to a mere perforated shell.' There is comparatively little new bone formation round this eaten-out part, but at the outer end of the clavicle some may be observed. Probably this has been a case of tubercular dis- 'ea9e' W. C.

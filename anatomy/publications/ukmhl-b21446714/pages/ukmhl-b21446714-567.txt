Tubercular Disease of the Spine. 535 4. Arthritis Deformans ad'ecting the spine. 7. 258. Arthritis Deformans, causing- Anchylosis.—Last four dorsal vertebrae—macerated, illustrating the above. There is considerable irregularity of the front of the bodies, and an outgrowth of bone at their upper and lower margins, especially on the sides, where in several places the overgrown margins have met, and bridged over the interverte bral discs. B. C. i. 3. M. 73. 7. 259. Arthritis Deformans, with Anchylosis and a Forward Bend.—Cervical, dorsal, and lumbar portions 'of a spine—partially macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The spine, as a whole, is bent forward. There has been irregular outgrowth at the margins of the bodies, and in many places they have been united by arches of bone, thrown across the intervertebral discs. This is especially noticeable on the right side of the dorsal region. On the left side the heads of the seventh and eighth ribs are fused to the bodies of the vertebrae with which they articulate. B.

Arthritis Deformans, with Anchylosis and Lateral Curvature.—Left half of a pelvis, with lumbar and lower three dorsal vertebra?—macerated, illustrating the above. The front of the sacro-iliac sychondrosis is ossified. There is considerable bony outgrowth at the margins of the inter- vertebral discs, but a special outgrowth of bone formed on the left side of the lumbar bodies has completely united them. The bones all over are somewhat irregular, and the muscular and tendinous impressions are unusually prominent. There has been a slight amount of lateral curvature. B. C. i. 3. M. 7.

Tubercular Ostitis involving Knce-jomt. 451 7. 65. Tubercular Arthritis beginning- in the Tibia.- Lower end of the left femur of a young adult, with the upper ends of the tibia and fibula—macerated, showing changes chiefly in the tibia. The upper end of the tibia is much lighter than normal. In front its texture is opened out, and its shape is considerably altered owing to rough excavations near the tubercle. The cartilaginous surfaces are comparative^ unchanged, although the bone between them in front is rarefied. There has appar- ently been a tubercular ostitis of the upper end of the tibia, which would probably affect the synovial membrane. The cancellous tissue of the lower end of the femur has been atrophied in the neighbourhood of the joint. F. P. C. 775. 7. 66. Tubercular Arthritis beginning in the Head of the Tibia.—Bones of a left knee-joint—macerated, illustrating the above. A fragment of dead cancellous bone lies loose in a cavity on the front of the inner tuberosity. This cavity communicates above by a round hole with the front of the articular surface, on the outer tuberosity. Some periosteal bone has been formed round the upper end of the tibia, and the articular surfaces are rarefied at the margins. The articular surfaces of the femur are rarefied at various places, but there is little or no new bone formed on the condyles. F. P. C. 782. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 7. 67. Tubercular Arthritis beginning in the Head of the Tibia.—Eight knee-joint, laid open from the front—in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient was a man aged 28. The disease had existed for twelve months, and was accompanied with much pain. "Bursa inflamed thickened, and suppurated, with abscesses in the vicinity of the joint.

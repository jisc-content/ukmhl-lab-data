The interior of the epiphyseal end of the shafts of the femur and tibia is in each case fatty, and when fresh was of a brown chocolate colour. The interior of the epiphyses themselves seems healthy. Much fibrous tissue has been formed around the joint, and had anchylosed it, thus accounting for the absence of starting pains. The skin on the side shows marks of a previous ulcer formed after one of the abscesses had burst. G. C. 2812. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 20. Tubercular Synovitis.—Section of an injected knee-joint —in spirit, illustrating the above. Tor some months the patient had heen treated with rest by splints, and also for a time in bed. As the disease was not checked, tbe joint was opened and scraped. Improvement was only temporary. The resulting sinuses refused to heal, and as the patient's general health began to fail, amputation was performed. When the section was first made, the shafts of the tibia and femur next to the knee-joint epiphyses were congested, and of a deep chocolate colour, and the bone was softened and fatty. The texture of the epiphyses seemed healthy. The cartilaginous surfaces are being attacked in the usual way. The periosteum was easily stripped off, and was detached in making the section. G. C. 3108, Presented by P. H. Maclaeen, F.E.C.S.E. 7. 21. Tubercular Synovitis.—Sections of an injected right knee-joint—in spirit, illustrating the above. The injection has passed well into the tibia, but imper- fectly into the femur and synovial membrane. The cartilaginous surface of the femur on the upper (inner) section is entirely covered by granulations, very few of which 2 E

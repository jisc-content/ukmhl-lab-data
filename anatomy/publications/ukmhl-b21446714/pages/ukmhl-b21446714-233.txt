201 Senile Changes in Bone, 6. 6. Senile Osteo-malaeia of the Femur.—Longitudinal sections of the left femur of an old woman, showing the above. The patient was bed-ridden in the workhouse, and all her bones showed a similar change. The bone is much lighter and more fragile than usual, and in places at either end could easily be marked with the finger- nail. The outer wall of bone has been reduced to a mere shell, except at the upper end of the shaft, and there the bone tissue, although thicker than elsewhere, is opened out almost into cancellated tissue. The cancellated tissue at the extremities is extremely light and delicate, and in places has disappeared. On the surface the marks of muscular attachments are less prominent than usual, and in places the surface is porous. When fresh, the interior of the bone was filled by a reddish- brown jelly-like material which had replaced the marrow, except at the middle of the shaft. It was not greasy. The bone was easily macerated, and is quite dry, except at the lower end, where it is slightly oily. The angle which the neck forms with the shaft does not seem altered, possibly because the patient was bed-ridden some time before her death. G. C. 3222. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1891. ^Senile Osteo-malaeia of the Tibia.—Sections of the left tibia from the same patient—macerated, to show the above. ^ The bone shows characteristic changes, in all respects similar to those seen in the previous specimen. G. C. 3223. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1891. Senile Osteo-malaeia of the Sacrum and Coccyx.— Sacrum, coccyx, and last two lumbar vertebrae, from the same patient—macerated, to show the above. The lower part of the sacrum is bent sharply forwards, at about a right angle to the rest of the bone.

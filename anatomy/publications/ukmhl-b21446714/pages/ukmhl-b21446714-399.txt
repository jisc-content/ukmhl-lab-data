Osteo-Sarcomata. 3Q7 of a transverse section of the tibia from the previous case, to illustrate the above. An irregular outgrowth of bone surrounds the tibia, and has evidently been part of the tumour. G. C. 1035. 6. 414. Osteo-Sareoma of the Tibia.—Plaster cast of the leg and foot from the previous case, before amputation. The cast shows well the characters described in the history of the case 6. 411. q.q 6. 415. Osteo-Sarcoma of Tibia—Upper parts of a tibia and fibula of a young person (epiphysis not yet united)—macerated, illustrating the above. There has been considerable loss of substance of the tibia at one place with development of new bone in the form of delicate spicules and plates at other places near. This has probably been a case of rapidly growing periosteal sarcoma, which has worked inwards as well as outwards. G. C. 376 6.416. Osteo-Sapcoma of Innominate Bone.-Portion of au innominate bone—macerated, illustrating the above. A very large fungus tumour enveloped this bone. The outer surface is covered with beautifully delicate spicules and plates, running outwards in various degrees of obliquity, the original bone below being greatly opened out. A cast of the os innominatum, showing the tumour, and also a specimen of the tumour, were entered in the General Catalogue, but cannot now be traced (1893). G. C. 815. 6. 417. Osteo-Sarcoma of Humerus.-Section of the lower

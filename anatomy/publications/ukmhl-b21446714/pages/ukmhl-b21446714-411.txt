Central Sarcomata. 379 —Section of the lower end of an injected left femur and adjacent part of tibia, soft parts partially dissected—in spirit, illustrating the above. A large tumour growing from the lower end of the femur has almost entirely replaced it. The tumour is composed of lobules of soft substance, separated by firmer and more vascular tissue, anibreaking down in the centre. The tumour has invaded the knee-joint, and has grown through the femur all round, especially behind. The bone is eroded but not expanded, and is not apparently infiltrated. A distinct capsule has been formed by the soft parts round the tumour. Described formerly as a "cancer of the lower end of the femur." G. C. 2446 Presented by Bell Pettigkew, F.K.C.S.E. 6. 438. Central Sarcoma of the Humerus.-Eight humerus, muscles dissected off—in spirit, illustrating the above. A firm mass is seen continuous with the bone, and entirely replacing it between the upper third and the condyles. Various sections have been made, and a hole has been cut through the interior. The soft parts round the tumour have been pushed aside and an appearance of a capsule has been f0rmed" G. C. 1054. Presented by Professor James Russell. 6. 439. Sarcomatous Tumour of a Rib.-Portions of two ribs of the left side—in spirit, illustrating the above. The interior of the lower of the two ribs is entirely re- placed by a tumour. The substance of the tumour is some- what spongy and spicular, and seems to have been breaking down. The upper of the two ribs is partly absorbed by the pressure of the tumour, which seems fairly well encapsuled on the outer and inner aspects. "The section of a tumour formed on a rib, supposed by

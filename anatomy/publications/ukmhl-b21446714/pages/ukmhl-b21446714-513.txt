Anchylosis after Tuberculosis of Elbow-joint. 481 less advanced. The bone is enlarged and roughened on its surface, especially in front. The articular surface formed by the lower epiphyses has for the most part disappeared. The upper end of the radius is not much altered. G. C. 3465. c.

Tubercular Arthritis, subsiding- after involvement Of Bone.—Bones of the right elbow-joint of a child—mace- rated, to illustrate the above. The upper end of the ulna is greatly enlarged, while that of the radius is less so. The lower portion of the shaft of both bones is greatly atrophied. The lower end of the humerus is enlarged, but the most noteworthy change is the absorption on the inner side, so that the ulna is displaced upwards. The two necrotic fragments at the lower end of the humerus are apparently the remains of its lower epiphyses. The shaft of the humerus is atrophied, but to a less extent than those of the radius and ulna. B. C. n. M. 50. 7. 144. Bony Anchylosis of the Elbow after Disease.— Lower end of a right humerus and adjacent parts of the radius and ulna—macerated, illustrating the above. On the front of the humerus, above the ulna, there is a small cavity. This, as well as the indications of former alterations of the articular surfaces, point to a healed tubercular disease of the elbow. W. C. H. 45. d.

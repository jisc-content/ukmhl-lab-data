Excision for Tubercular Knee-joint. 461 7. 89. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Bones of a left knee-joint—macerated, showing bony anchylosis in the straight position. There is a considerable gap between the condyles of the femur, chiefly at the expense of the outer, but the walls of the gap seem to have healed. The osseous anchylosis between the condyles of the femur and tuberosities of the tibia is formed by well-developed cancellous tissue. The texture of the bones is firm and free from grease. "W. C.

Return of Tubercular Disease after Excision of the Knee.—Section of an injected knee of a lad aged 16 years in spirit, illustrating the above. , The limb was amputated two months after excision on account of the continuation of discharge from several sinuses. The specimen shows, however, that the soft parts rather than the bone have been involved by the return of tuberculosis. The ends of the bones are fatty, but not tubercular. Two caseous centres may be seen behind the lower end of the femur. A line of fibrous tissue indicates the junction of the two bones. G. C. 3071. . Presented by A. G. Millee, F.B.C.S.E. 7. 91. Return of Tubercular Disease after Excision of the Knee.—Section of the knee-joint of a child after excision—in spirit, showing the position of a tubercular sinus. The child was aged 10.years, and the joint had been excised two years previously in another town for tubercular disease. The limb was amputated by Dr P. H. MacLaren, partly for the persistence of the discharge from a sinus, partly for the fibrous union, and partly for the deficient growth of the limb. There is a wide fibrous union between the bones. The epiphysis has been removed at the excision from both femur and tibia, thus accounting for the want of growth. A blue rod

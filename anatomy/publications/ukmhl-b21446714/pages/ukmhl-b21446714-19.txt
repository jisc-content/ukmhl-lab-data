Preface. xv means the General Manuscript Catalogue, in which all speci- mens presented to the Museum are entered, unless they have formed part of a collection provided with a separate Catalogue. B.C. refers to the MS. Catalogue of the "Bell Collection;" and W.C. refers to the MS. Wilson Catalogue.

He would be very ungrateful, too, if he were to forget to mention another to whom his thanks are especially due. Tentative arrangements and re-arrangements of the specimens have, of course, been required : taking down and re-mounting

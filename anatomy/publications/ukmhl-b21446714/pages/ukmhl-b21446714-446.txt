414 Diseases of Bone. THE SKULL. I. Abnormalities in Growth or Development. Abnormalities in the Sutures. 6. 516. Absence of the Coronal Suture —Skull of an adult— macerated, illustrating the above. The sagittal suture is continued forwards as a permanent frontal suture to the nasal bones. There is no trace whatever of the coronal suture. The other sutures are quite distinct, and, from the appearance of the teeth, the person must have been about middle age. The skull is very round, and there is unusual breadth in the frontal region. The occipital bone projects backwards from the contour of the rest of the skull. On holding the skull to the light, it is seen to be very thin in many places, especially near the sagittal suture. G. C. 3483. 6. 517. Partial Obliteration of the Coronal Suture—Skull —macerated, illustrating the above. The sagittal suture is continued forwards into the frontal suture, which, however, is nearly obliterated for about one inch from the nasal bones, although it is distinct elsewhere. The end of the coronal suture has been obliterated from below the level of the temporal ridge on the right side, and from a little below the same ridge on the left side. The vault of the skull is unsymmetrical, slanting more obliquely on the right side, while it is rounded a little more than usual on the left, as if the skull, in a plastic state, had been flattened towards the left from pressure on the right side. The bridge of the nose is peculiarly wide and flat.° G. C. 3484. 6. 518. Permanence of the Frontal Suture.—Skull—macer- ated, illustrating the above. The skull is peculiarly heavy and massive, and the bony ridges are strongly marked. The frontal suture has persisted. The other sutures seem normal. G. C. 34S5.

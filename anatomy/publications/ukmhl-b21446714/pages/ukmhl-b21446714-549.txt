Tubercular Disease of the Spine. 517 to the fourth lumhar vertebra, partly dissected—in spirit, illustrating the above. The man died after the opening of a psoas-abscess. One was •present on either side. Between the seventh and eighth dorsal vertebrae there has been some absorption and sinking together of the bodies. Between the eleventh and twelfth there is a fibrous-looking nodule. Between the first and second lumbar vertebras there is an area of caseation softening and absorption, and a similar but smaller area between the second and third lumbar vertebrae. An abscess is shown on the right side, with its walls laid •open. It was found on dissection to communicate by narrow •passages with the caseating centres in the lumbar vertebrae. This specimen teaches the following important points :— ((1) That centres of caseation may exist, and give rise to .abscesses, without any displacement of the vertebrae; (2) that the communication between such centres and an abscess cavity or cavities may be very small and tortuous, and inaccessible from any wound that could be made during life; (3) that •there may be separate centres of tuberculosis in the spinal column, causing displacement at one place and an abscess at another, and that the different centres need not in any way •communicate; and (4) that the different centres may be in different phases of advance or subsidence.

Tubercular Deposits in Several Vertebrae.—Part of the eleventh and twelfth dorsal and first four lumbar vertebra—macerated, to show the effects of tubercular disease in several places. The upper part of the eleventh dorsal vertebra has been absorbed. Upon the twelfth dorsal vertebra, what seems to be a healed cavity is seen at the front, with new bone formation on either side. The first lumbar vertebra shows one or two partially healed apertures in front, with advancing

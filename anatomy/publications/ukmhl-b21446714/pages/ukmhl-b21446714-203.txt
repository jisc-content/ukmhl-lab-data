Gunshot Fractures of the Tibia. 171 Cancellous Tissue.—Upper end of the left tibia of a young adult—macerated, to show the above. A bullet is wired in a cavity in the head. The injury was sustained at Waterloo. The extensive suppuration made amputation necessary. The space round' the ball contains a large fragment of cancellous bone, and some new periosteal bone has formed down the front of the shaft, but for a short distance only. B. C. xvii. 31. . 358. Bullet lodged in the Knee, followed by Tuberculosis. Upper end of a right tibia—macerated, showing the above. A bullet is wired in position on the top of the outer tuberosity. The articular surface is very irregular, being occupied by excavations. The walls of these are opened out, although one at the back shows signs of healing. On the outer condyle an island of necrotic bone remains, with its articular surface unchanged, and surrounded by a deep trench. At one or two other places similar though smaller islands are seen. These appearances are identical with those seen in advanced tuber- cular disease. The surface of the bone below the articulation is much roughened by newly formed periosteal bone. This indicates that sepsis has accompanied the tubercular process. F. P. C. 245. 359. Gunshot Fracture of the Tibia and Fibula.— Right tibia and fibula—macerated, showing the above. The fragments are wired together. /w * "^f TJ giVe a Picture 0f the statG of the French wounded (Waterloo), who were brought into Brussels upon waggons, fourteen days after the battle, and were never dressed before that time" (Sir Charles The part of the tibia struck has been comminuted into many pieces, most of which are loose. Fissures, however, do not run beyond the shaft. The fibula has been broken across.

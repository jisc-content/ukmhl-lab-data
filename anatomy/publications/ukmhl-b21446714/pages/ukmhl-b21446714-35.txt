Hypertrophy. 3 1. 6. Thickening of the Capsular Ligament of the Hip- joint from Strain.—Upper end of the right femur of an old person,—in spirit—showing an ununited fracture of the neck, and changes consequent thereon. The soft parts are cleared off, excepting the ligamentous attachment round the hip. The patient, a man aged 70 years, lived for fifteen months after ■receipt of an intra-capsular fracture of the neck of the femur. The neck of the bone has been greatly absorbed, and the broken surfaces are smoothed and slightly hollowed out. Bands of newly-formed fibrous tissue unite the detached head to the capsule and to the neck. The thickening of the capsule is very manifest. G. C. 1478. Presented by Prof. "W. R. Turner and Alexander Watson, F.R.C.S.E., 1834. i. 7. Thickening- of Epidermis from Pressure and Friction. —Longitudinal section of the left foot of a man,—in spirit— showing changes in the epithelium of the heel and ball of the toes. Owing to a severe compound fracture of the Tibia in his youth, the patient had for 30 years been unable to walk on his heel. He had therefore borne his weight on the fore part of his foot. The thickness of the epidermis below the balls of the toes is much greater than that below the heel. This condition is the reverse of what is found when the tread is normal. G. C. 3130. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E., 1889. 1. 8. Hypertrophy of Kidney.—This preparation consists of bladder, a sound kidney on one side, and a shrivelled one on the other, from an adult man,—in spirit. The bladder is laid open from above. The patient died of some complaint unconnected with the kidneys, and their condition was only accidentally observed at the post-mortem examination. The right kidney is not much larger than the prostate gland, and is calcareous and shrivelled, this most probably being

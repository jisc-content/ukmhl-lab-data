Hip-Joint.—Dissection of the hip-joint—injected, showing the ligamentum teres and the ligaments on the back and upper parts, the front of the capsule having been removed—in spirit. B. C. n. N. 13. 4. 17. Hip-Joint.—Preparation of the ilium and adjacent part" of the femur. The bones are macerated, and the ligaments dried and painted. These ligaments are, particularly, the "ischio-femoral band," described by Dr Struthers (" Edinburgh Medical Journal," 1858), passing spirally at the back from the ischium to the fore-part of the great trochanter, and so placed as to check rotation inwards during flexion. The ligamentum teres, exposed by Dr Struthers' method, is seen not to be tense, and to lie out of its functional groove, in the erect posture. G. C. 3467. Presented by Professor Struthers. 4. 18.

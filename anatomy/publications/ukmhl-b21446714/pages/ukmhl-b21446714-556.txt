Diseases of Joints. 524 The bodies of the last cervical and first six dorsal verte- brae have been destroyed, and have disappeared. The spine has thus been so bent upon itself that the head of the first rib is close to that of the sixth, and the bodies of the sixth cervical and sixth dorsal vertebrae nearly touch. The spine of the third dorsal vertebra is greatly atrophied, and there is a distinct space between its laminae and those of the vertebrae above and below it. Some of the articular processes seem to be anchylosed. This must have been a case of paraplegia, and probably also of abscess. G. C. 596. a. 7. 236. Tubercular Disease, with Destruction of the Bodies.—Portion of a dorsal and lumbar spine—in spirit, showing extensive destruction of the bodies of two of the lower dorsal vertebrae. Some of the debris of the affected vertebrae seems to have been crushed backwards upon the spinal cord, and no doubt compressed it. The bodies of the adjacent vertebrae have been eroded on the surface, and opaque patches of caseation can be seen here and there in their interior, although there has not been much alteration of their general shape. Part of the wall of an abscess cavity is shown attached to the sides of all the bodies in the preparation. It seems to have opened backwards past the transverse processes, as well as communicated with the canal at the place where the bodies have disappeared. B. C. 1. 3. M. 52. 7. 237. Tubercular Disease, with Destruction of the Bodies —Paraplegia.—Lower cervical and dorsal spine, apparently of a young person—in spirit, showing great destruction of the bodies in the mid-dorsal region. '' The vertebrae of the back carious, seen as they appear in a fresh state. The bodies of several have been completely destroyed, and their places filled up with a curdy scrophulous matter contained in a thick

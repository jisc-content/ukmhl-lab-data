597 Gangrene. 11. 78. Gangrene from Frost Bite. — Forepart of foot in which the toes have been killed by exposure to cold—in spirit. The line of separation, formed by ulceration, is complete in the skin, and is in progress in the deeper tissues. Some portions of the extensor tendons still remain on the dorsum. The metatarso-phalangeal joint of the great toe is exposed, and the head of the first metatarsal bone is bare, and has probably been in process of separation. The toes are apparently but little changed. They had probably been killed outright, and had not had time to shrivel and dry up. G. C. 225. 11. 79.

It became shrivelled and dry before it was removed. The ligaments at the meta-carpo phalangeal joint had been destroyed. Granulations have eroded the surface of the proximal end of the first phalanx.

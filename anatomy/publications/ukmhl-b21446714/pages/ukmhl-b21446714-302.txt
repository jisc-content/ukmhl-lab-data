270 Diseases of Bone. 6 169. Rarefaction of Fragments of the Fibula after Compound Fracture.-Lower half of a fibula, portions wanting-muscles cleaned off-dried, to illustrate the above. About three inches of the bone have disappeared. The margins of the remaining fragments are rarefied, and a crust of new periosteal bone has been developed near. These changes have probably been caused by a severe compound fracture. 1 G. C. 1144. Presented by Professor James Russell. 6 170 Absorption and Irregular Outgrowth of the Tibia after Compound Fracture.-Lower end of a right tibia- macerated, illustrating the above. The upper end of the fragment is atrophied and smoothed off at some places, while at others it shows irregular outgrowths. The case has apparently been one of compound fracture m process of healing by fibrous tissue. B. 0. i. 5. M. 80. c. Where the chief changes are in the form of enlargement. 6 171 Periosteal Thickening following Compound Frac- ' ture.-Upper portion of a right fibula, after fracture- macerated, showing the above. At the broken part there is some irregularity from absorp- tion, and beyond that a crust of new periosteal bone has developed. This is probably the result of a compound f racture. B. C. i. 5.

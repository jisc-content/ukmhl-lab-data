342 Diseases of Bone. first phalanx of the little finger of a left hand—macerated, illustrating the above. An expanded shell attached to each bone is evidently the remains of a cartilaginous tumour. That on the metacarpal bone is the more complete, and has arisen from the back of the bone, at its phalangeal end. It forms nearly a complete shell, but is perforated and deficient here and there. The interior has, attached to the wall, numerous irregular processes or septa, which before maceration must have separated cartilaginous nodules. The expanded part on the phalanx has been partly sawn away, but it has originally been less complete than that on the metacarpal bone. The interior of the phalanx is quite exposed. This specimen was formerly described as a case of " spina ventosa." <>. C- 205' 6. 363. Chondroma of Little Finger.-Phalanges of what seems to be a little finger, apparently of a young person, with chondroma arising from the first phalanx—in spirit. Amputated at St. George's Hospital, and presented to Mr Wilson by Mr Brodie in 1806. An extension from the back of the first phalanx passes for a short distance on to the surface of the tumour, the interior: of which is composed of small lobules of hyaline cartilage, now rendered very opaque by the spirit. Formerly described as tumour of first phalanx of thumb. W. C. G. 32. a. 6. 364. Chondroma of Fingers.-Plaster cast of a left hand, apparently of a woman, illustrating the above. There are tumours upon all the phalanges and upon some of the metacarpal bones. The largest one, which is on the middle finger, has attained the size of a small orange. Those on the index finger are next in size, and extend nearly to the tip The third finger is least affected, but shows distinct

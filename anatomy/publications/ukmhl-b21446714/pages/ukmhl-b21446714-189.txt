Fractures of the Tarsal Bones. 157 3. 320. Fracture of the Os Calais.—Lower end of a left tibia and fibula, with the astragalus and remains of a broken os calcis —muscles dissected off and in spirit. A young woman, 19 years of age, leaped from a window two floors from the street, and fractured the os calcis into six or eight fragments, one of which projects into the back part of the ankle-joint. Several weeks after the injury, in consequence of disease of the joint and abscesses about the foot, associated with necrosis, amputation of the leg was performed. The patient recovered. The greater part of the os calcis seems to have been crushed up behind and to the outer side of the astragalus. Some new bone has been formed on the sides of the original os calcis, while at the back a cavity extends into its substance, near the orifice of which there is a piece of dead bone. G. C. 1981. Presented by Alexander Watson, Esq., March 1839. 3. 321. Fracture Of the OS Calcis.-The lower end of a right tibia, fibula, astragalus, and portion of the os calcis—cleaned, and in spirit. The upper portion of the os calcis has been comminuted and 1S separate from the lower. The broken surfaces are apparently covered by lymph. The articular cartilage upon the astragalus and outer malleolus is roughened and partially removed. This has probably been a case of compound fracture of the os calcis, followed by inflammation and suppuration. G. C. 3504. GUNSHOT FEACTTJEES OF THE LOWEE LIMB. (a.) Chiefly from Waterloo. 3. 322.

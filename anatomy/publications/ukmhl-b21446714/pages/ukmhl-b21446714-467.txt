Tubercular Synovitis of Knee-joint. 435 7. 24. Tubercular Synovitis destroying- Cartilage.—Lower ■ end of a right femur and patella removed by excision—in spirit. The articular surface of the femur is greatly altered. At the margins of the trochlear surface, and at the site of the ligamenta alaria, the cartilage is replaced by the encroaching synovial membrane, which has spread over it. Upon the front of the trochlear surface, and upon the under surface of the inner and slightly also of the outer condyle, the cartilage has been undermined, and lies in loose flakes and tags. The cartilaginous surface of the patella has also suffered both from the encroachment and the undermining forms of invasion. G. C. 2843. Presented by Professor T. Annandale. 7. 25. Tubercular Synovitis, with Peri-articular Abscess.— Eight knee-joint injected with vermilion, and laid open—in spirit, illustrating changes chiefly in the outlying portions of the synovial membrane. The upper and inner part of the trochlear surface of the femur shows the gradual growth upon it of the vascular synovial membrane, but the rest of the articular surface of the femur is comparatively unchanged, except for a narrow band of vascularity between the outer condyle and the trochlear surface. The upper part of the synovial membrane has been much affected. It has been caseous, and at the inner side has broken down, to form a tubercular abscess, which has burrowed under the vastus internus, and is now seen to contain the curdy and flocculent material, characteristic of tubercular abscesses.

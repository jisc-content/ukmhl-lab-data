52 Injuries of Bone. maceratedâ€”Bhowing the above injury, with a trephine opening and the mark of a Hoy's saw. The seat of injury has evidently been at the right parietal eminence, where comminution exists, and whence some com- minuted fragments have apparently been removed by trephin- ing From the seat of injury at the right parietal bone one lar-e fissure extends to the left beyond the middle of the left parietal bone. Another fissure passes forward into the coronal suture, and another descends through the back of the squamous portion of the temporal bone to end in the Glenoid fossa. Another irregular fissure unites this with the coronal suture, and a small vertical split is seen m the mastoid process. The injury is one which might have been produced by a heavy blow upon the right parietal 3 35 Severe Comminution and Fissuring of the Skull.- " Eight half of a skull-macerated-showing an extensive ^Tr'om a patient in Middlesex Hospital.

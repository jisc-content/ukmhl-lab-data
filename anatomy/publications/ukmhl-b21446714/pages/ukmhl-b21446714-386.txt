The connecting bridge ■of bone is thrown out into numerous large irregular processes, the tips of which are deficient, as if they had been covered by •cartilage when recent. At one spot, on the outer side, what seems to be the remains of an articulation between the tibia and fibula is perceptible. The rest of the upper end of the tibia is little altered, except at the posterior and inner sides, where the same spinous processes are seen. The lower ends ■of both bones are fused into one common mass, and the bone seems to have been broadened out. A few spinous projections are seen at the lower end of both bones. As on the other side, ossification has not occurred in the interosseous membrane. (For an account of this condition, see "Arch, fur Kim. Chir.," Band 41, p. 420.) B. C. i. 6. M. 20 to 23. 6. 378. Exostosis of the Tibia and Fibula.-UPPer end of a right tibia and fibula—macerated, illustrating the above. There is an anchylosis of the two bones a little below their usual place of joining, which is very like the condition found in the previous specimens. It may be considered to be due to a bonv outgrowth from each bone towards the other. B. C. H. M. 34. 6. 379. Exostosis Of Clavicle.-Left clavicle of an adult- macerated, illustrating the above. The bone is stunted in growth. A large irregular mass projecting downwards from the outer end is continuous with the articular surface, which is thus much enlarged. Some irregular nodules project downwards from near the inner end, and seem in the recent state to have been capped with cartilage. The normal curves of the bone have been straightened B. C. i. 6.

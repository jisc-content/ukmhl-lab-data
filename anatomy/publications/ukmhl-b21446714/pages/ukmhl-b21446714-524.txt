492 Diseases of Joints. This specimen was formerly described as one of " scrofulous disease," but arthritis deformans seems a more probable cause of the condition. B. C. n. M. 10. 7. 172. Advanced Arthritis Deformans (?) with Anchy- losis.—Posterior half of a vertical transverse section of a right hip-joint—soft parts cleaned off—in spirit, illustrating the above. "This disease took place eight years before the patient's death, but with what symptoms I could not learn. He had acquired, however, by throwing back the pelvis, the power of walking, although the anchylosis had formed in the complete bent state of the joint. There is still a cartilaginous crust between the bones ; but very little alteration in the form of either bone has taken place, nor has the anchylosis been attended with much adhesive ossific inflammation." "Presented to me" (Mr G. Wilson) " by Mr Daw, house-surgeon to St. George's Hospital" (1808). The lower side of the neck of the bone, near the head, is enlarged, and there is also some enlargement of the head itself within the acetabulum, as well as of the margins of the aceta- bulum. These alterations remind one of the changes in arthritis deformans. Possibly the patient with the disease advancing had been confined to bed, and had kept the knee flexed for some time, after which it would perhaps be impossible to straighten it. W. C. H. 59. 7. 173. Advanced Arthritis Deformans, with Anchylosis.— Anterior half of the previous specimen—macerated. There are bony outgrowths at the articular margins of the bones, and the previously noted enlargements of the head and neck of the femur are well shown. The former position of the cartilage is still recognisable. The cancellous and compact tissue of the femur remain well developed. W. C. H. 70.

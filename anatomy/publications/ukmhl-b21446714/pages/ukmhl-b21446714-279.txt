The specimen shows an area of bare dead bone, with a great thickening and vascularity of the periosteum on what had been living. The dead bone has been pitted on the surface by the vascular granulations, which have been lifted up in many places to show this. Other vascular granulations can be seen here and there coming through the bone from below. At one place there is a narrow grey strip of new periosteal bone. This has evidently not been a case of erysipelas, but of the above, a disease of ten mistaken for it. These cases often die, as this one probably did, of septic poisoning, with or without pysemic complications. q q 2228 Presented by Alexander Watson, F.R.C.S.E., February 1837. 04.

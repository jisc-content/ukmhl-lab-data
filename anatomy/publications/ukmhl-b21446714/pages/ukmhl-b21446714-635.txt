603 Pathology of Stumps. each, especially upon the tibia. A firm mass of bone unites their distal ends together. Possibly this condition has been due to a chronic ulcer on face of the stump. B. C. 1. 5. M. 43. 11. 96. Stump of a Femup, with Necrosis and Thicken- ing".—Section of the injected stump of a femur—macerated, illustrating the above. A small necrosed fragment at the end has been in process of separation, and a strong crust of new bone has been formed round the sawn extremity. W. C. G. 22. 11. 97. Stump of a Femur after Amputation. — Section of the injected stump of a femur—in spirit, illustrating the above. Eound the sawn extremity there is a considerable crust of bone, which extends for some distance up the shaft, while new bone has been forming across the end of the medullary cavity. The vascularity of the new bone is well shown by the injection. The large amount of new bone has, no doubt, been due to septic inflammation of the soft parts over the bone. B. C. 1. 5. M. 44. 11.98. Stump of a Femur, altered by Chronic Septic Osteo-myelitis.—Enlarged end of a femur after amputation— macerated, illustrating the above. The lower end is rounded in shape, but its surface is irregular and is covered by a spongy carious bone. The whole shaft is greatly thickened. The original compact tissue cannot be traced. The wall of the medullary cavity is formed of bone, which is intermediate in character between cancellous and compact tissue. It is of irregular thickness. W. C. G. 23.

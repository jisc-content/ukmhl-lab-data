Rickets. 213 the angles of the ribs are as usual unduly prominent. The lumbar spine is comparatively unaltered. The pelvis is flattened from before backwards, and the lower end of the sacrum and coccyx project into the outlet. Lower Limbs.—The bones of the right leg are longer and better developed than those of the left. The femora on both sides are curved forward near the upper end. The tibiae and fibula? are bent forwards and inwards, this change being specially seen on the left side, where the shape of the fibula reminds one of an Australian boomerang, and has been firmly pressed against the tibia. There is a very marked projection on the outer side of the os calcis on either side. The bones of the upper limbs are not so much distorted as those of the lower. They show a certain degree, especially in the humeri, of the alteration noted in the previous skeleton, but the changes are much less than in the lower limbs. The right radius seems to have sustained a Colles' fracture. B. C. i. 3. M. 28. ft. 28. Skeleton affected by Rickets.—Skeleton of an adult woman—macerated, showing rickety changes in the lower limbs and pelvis. There is a very slight lateral dorsal curve, not sufficient to have distinctly altered the thorax. The pelvis is somewhat flattened from before backwards. In the lower limbs the femora are curved forwards and outwards at the upper ends, and the linea aspera in each case is remarkably prominent. The tibia? and fibuke are bent inwards about the middle, with the usual ridges on the concavity. The bones of the feet show scarcely any alteration, except for the prominence of the tubercle on the outer side of the os calcis. P,. C. i. 3. M. 22. • 29.

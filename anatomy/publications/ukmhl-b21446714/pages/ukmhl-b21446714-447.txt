415 Abnormalities of the Skull. 6. 519. Absence of the Sagittal Suture.—Skull-cap, apparently of a young person—macerated, illustrating the above. The coronal suture is well marked, and is not yet com- pletely ossified. There is, however, no trace of the sagittal suture upon the outside, and only a faint indication of its presence on the inside, a little behind the coronal suture. There are numerous dimples corresponding to the convolutions upon the inner surface. The whole bone is very thin, and is not distinguishable into plates. B. C. i. 3. M. 43. 6. 520. Absence Of the Sagittal Suture.—Cast in glycerine and gelatine of the interior of the foregoing skull-cap, showing the form of the convolutions which must thus have fitted closely into the depressions on the bone.

Senile Atrophy.—Skull and lower jaw of an old woman- macerated, illustrating the above. This skull is from the same subject from whom No. 6. 6 and others were taken, and which illustrated an unusual form of senile decay. The changes in the skull, however, may be taken as illustrating those of ordinary senile decay. The sutures on the vault are more or less obliterated. The bones are light, and in many places are atrophied. The outer walls of the orbits, for instance, are in great measure deficient, and the walls of the antrum are as thin as paper. The alveolar borders of the upper and lower jaws are greatly atrophied. The lower jaw is completely cedentulous; its angle is obtuse, and the narrowed mental foramen on each side opens at or near its upper border. On the upper jaw there are sockets for the roots or stumps of two incisors, and the bone near the sockets is less atrophied than it is elsewhere. The under surface of the skull is somewhat porous. The thickness of the

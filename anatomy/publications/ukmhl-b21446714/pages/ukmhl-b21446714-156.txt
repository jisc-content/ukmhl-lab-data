Injuries of Bone. 124 3. 219. {Contd.)— The fracture has been nearly transverse. A part of the bone at the seat of fracture has necrosed, and has been in process of separation. Beyond the commencing groove of separation, irregular, newly-formed bone has been thrown out. The fracture has probably been compound and septic. F. P. C. 125. 3. 220. United Compound Fracture of the Shaft.—Eight femur of a young person—macerated, showing the above. All the epiphyses, except that for the small trochanter, have been lost during maceration. The lower fragment is internal to the upper, and its lower end has been tilted forwards and outwards. There has been much inflammation, and the surfaces above and below the fracture are crusted with newly-formed periosteal bone. The fracture has therefore probably been compound. F. P. C. 126. 3. 221. Badly united Fracture a little way below the Small Trochanter.—Upper end of a left femur—macerated, and divided vertically, showing the above. The line of fracture has begun below the small trochanter, and has run obliquely downwards and outwards. The upper fragment is tilted outwards, and over-riding has occurred. The medullary cavity is interrupted by cancellous tissue. The union has been very solid. P- p- c- 10°- 3. 222. United Fracture a little below the Lesser Tro- chanter.—Left femur—macerated, showing the above. The upper end is tilted outwards and slightly forwards.. The lower part of the shaft has lost its usual forward bendr and has received a slight bend backwards as well as one' distinctly outwards. The outer condyle is thus relatively raised, and some knock-knee must have existed. Although in some respects the shape of this bone resembles that found in rickets, its similarity to the specimens which pre-

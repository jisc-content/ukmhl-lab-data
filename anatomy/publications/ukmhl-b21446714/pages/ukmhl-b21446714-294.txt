2G2 Diseases of Bone. 6. 143. Sequestrum, after Acute Suppurative Osteo- myelitis Of the Tibia.—Portion of the shaft of the tibia of a child, illustrating the above.

Sequestrum, after Acute Suppurative Osteo- myelitis Of the Tibia.—Large portion of the shaft of a tibia, illustrating the above. The specimen represents nearly the entire thickness of the shaft at one place, with a varying proportion, mostly of the front at other places; the bone is greatly eroded and pitted, not only at the margins and on the internal surface, but over the greater part of the outer surface as well. G. C. 1170. Presented by Professor James Russell. <8. 145. Sequestra, after Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis. —Two portions of the shafts of long bones, illustrating the above. The longer piece shows the usual characters of a sequestrum, after suppurative inflammation. The other is very irregular, and has some new bone growth upon it. These specimens are described in the M.S. Catalogue as "sequestrum, removed from tibia of a boy, aged 12 years." This probably refers to the longer piece only. G. C. 796. Presented by Sir George Ballingall. 6. 146. Sequestrum, after Acute Suppurative Osteo- myelitis Of the Tibia.—Portion of the shaft of a tibia, illustrating the above.

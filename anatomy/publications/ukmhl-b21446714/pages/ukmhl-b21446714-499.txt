Tubercular Ostitis involving Hip-joint. 467 upper end of the femur is rough and opened out, and the hone is absorbed, especially upon its anterior and upper aspects. B. C. n. M. 3. 7. 105. Tubercular Arthritis involving the Acetabulum.— Plaster cast, coated with wax, of the pelvis and thighs of the patient from whom the previous specimen was obtained. There is marked adduction of the diseased hip-joint, with tilting of that side of the pelvis, and swelling round the troch- anter. The ulcers on the outer side of the thigh have a characteristically tubercular appearance, and have, no doubt, com- municated with the joint. j>. q ii< 2 7. 106. Tubercular Arthritis destroying- the Aceta- bulum.—Left ilium and upper end of femur — macerated, illustrating the above. "The neck of the thigh bone was in the pelvis. The patient was ■exhausted by irritation and suppuration." The bottom of the acetabulum is wanting, and a circular- aperture of one and a half inches in diameter thus leads into the pelvis. The remains of the walls of the acetabulum are rarefied and rough. There is a considerable development of new bone round the outer surface of the acetabulum. The head of the femur is wasted down to a pointed extremity. Hew periosteal bone has been formed on the under and front aspects of the neck. This has evidently been a case where septic abscess has complicated the original disease. B. C. n. M. 5. 7. 107.

The bottom of the acetabulum is wanting, and an irregular cavity one and a quarter inches by two inches in diameter thus

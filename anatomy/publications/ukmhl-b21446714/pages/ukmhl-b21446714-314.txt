282 Diseases of Bone. The upper end of the radius shows patches of absorption passing into the interior and through to the other side without any deposit of new bone on the surface. The ulna shows a similar condition at two places, one at the upper end on the inner side, and another at the back of the shaft. Tubercular disease seems the most probable cause of this condition. G. C. 994. 6. 208. Tubercular Disease of the Femur.-Upper end of a ri^ht femur—macerated, illustrating the above. There are large patches, of absorption and rarefaction on the back of the shaft and below the lesser trochanter. The surface of the bone is also somewhat rarefied, especially to- wards the lower end of the specimen. Possibly this has been a case of tubercular disease. F- P. C. 38 <. h. Where the chief changes are in the form of ahsorption and enlargement. 6 209. Tubercular Enlargement of the Humerus.-Lower end of the shaft of a humerus, portion cut out to show the interior—macerated, illustrating the above. The interior of the bone is rarefied and hollowed out, and there is a shell of variable thickness on the surface, giving the appearance of expansion. The shaft of the bone above the diseased part has an exceedingly thin shell, and the medullary canal communicates with the hollow below. ^is condition was formerly called " spina-ventosa." **• ^ - Presented by Professor James Russell. 6 210 Tubercular Enlargement of the Lower End of the Femur.-Lower end of a left femur, with anchyiosed patella-macerated, illustrating the above. The articular surfaces are very irregular, and one is par tially deficient. The interior is rarefied and partially absorbed,

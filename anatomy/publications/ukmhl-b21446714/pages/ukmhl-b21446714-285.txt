Necrosis from Pus-forming Organisms. 253 knee becomes very delicate, and at the knee there is practically no bone at all. The bone forming the upper end of the tibia is reduced to a shell with numerous apertures in it. The shaft of the tibia is also reduced to a hollow and fragile shell, which in many places is perforated by apertures. The contrast between the atrophy of the tibia and the new bone development round the sequestrum in the femur is very striking. G. C. 3499. Presented bij Alexis Thomson, F.E.C.S.E., 1893. 6.117. Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis of the Femur— Necrosis, Anchylosis of the Knee, and Atrophy of the Tibia.—Water-colour drawing by John T. Kelly of the previous specimen, when fresh. The drawing shows the enlargement of the femur, and the sequestrum lying in its cavity surrounded by grey gelatinous material. Near the lower end of the shaft of the femur the new bone is shown opened out in texture and the epiphysis and adjacent part of the shaft entirely occupied by a brown fatty material. The same substance is seen in the section of the patella and tibia. The cancellated tissue in the tibia is entirely absorbed and the bony shell is very thin. The muscles round the bone were very soft and fatty. G. C. 3500 6. 118.

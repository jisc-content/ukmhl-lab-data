120 Injuries of Bone, 3. 208. Comminuted Fracture of the Upper End of the Shaft and Great Trochanter.—Upper end of a right femur—macerated, showing the above. A portion of the head has been sawn off, for convenience in mounting. The patient was a coachman. " He was in the act of pulling up his horses, when the foot-board broke, and he was precipitated, with his weight falling in the line of the thigh-bone. The urethra was burst." He lived for six weeks all but two days. The head, neck, and front portion of the upper end of the- shaft form one fragment, which projects forwards. The trochanters, and a splinter of about four inches of the back of the shaft, form another fragment, which in its turn is some- what comminuted above, while the remainder of the shaft forms the lower fragment. Much new bone has been formed from the upper end of the shaft, some from the trochanteric fragment, and only a very little from the head and neck fragment. This specimen is figured in Bell's "Observations on Injuries of the Spine and Thigh Bone," plate vii. fig. 1. B. C. i. 1. M. 20. c. 3. 209. United Fracture below the Small Trochanter. - Plaster of Paris cast of the upper end of a right femur in the- Barclay Collection, showing the above. There had been firm, osseous union. The upper fragment has been tilted much forwards. The lower fragment has been drawn up, but neither fragment has been rotated. G. C. 3281. 3 210. Structure of the Shaft of the Femur.-Longitudmal section of a right femur—macerated, to illustrate the above. The specimen shows the relative proportion of cancellous and compact tissue in the shaft and at the extremities. G. C. 3559.

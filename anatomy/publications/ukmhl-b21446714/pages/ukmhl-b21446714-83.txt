Fractures of the Skull. 51 3. 31. Depressed Fracture of the Vault of the Skull, with a Fissure passing" into the Base,—Calvarium of a boy —macerated—showing a fracture of the frontal and right parietal bones. " This boy was brought into the hospital in a state of death-like insensibility, and his head misshapen. An effusion upon the temple- tempted me to make an incision through the scalp, and there I found the bone shattered. I applied a small trephine, and afterwards the cranium saw, and took away the pieces of broken bone, and washed out the coagulum from under, but there, followed no amelioration of symptoms. The boy died, and now it is seen that a fracture extended round the fore- head to the base of the skull, and that the injury was too great to allow of the expectation that the patient could live." From the depression behind the seat of fracture, and from the horizontal fissure in the frontal bone, the injury must have been very severe. B. C. 1. 2. M. 2. 3. 32.

The fragments were depressed, and so tightly wedged down that the trephine had to be twice applied before they could be elevated. The dura mater was torn, and the brain lacerated by the uy ury. Some brain matter escaped. The patient remained insensible, had convulsions, and died in five days after the accident." B. C. 1. 2. M. 14 b. 33.

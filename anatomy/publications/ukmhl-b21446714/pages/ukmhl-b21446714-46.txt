14 General Pathology. 1. 46. Repair in Artery.—Portion of a large artery, probably the femoral, laid open some days after a ligature,—in spirit. The artery had been ligatured with silk, the ends of which are shown hanging down. At and near the point of ligature lymph has been effused, and extending up from the ligature there is a long narrow clot. The interior of the artery is marked by ridges, caused by changes in the middle coat. G. C. 3152. 1. 47. Repair in Viscera.— Specimen required. HEALING BY . SECOND INTENTION. 1. 48.

The healing process went on rapidly up to a point, but at the time the cast was taken the process had become sluggish, although still progressing. The granulations are somewhat oedematous and raised above the level of the surrounding skin. The characteristics are otherwise those of a healing ulcer. G. C. 2883. Presented by Charles "W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1889. 1. 49. Granulating Ulcer.-Finger and part of hand covered by granulations after a burn, artificially injected with gum and vermilion,—in spirit. The patient, when drunk, had fallen into the fire. His hands had been so severely burned that both required to be amputated. The irregular, granular appearance of the surface and its great vascularity are well brought out. The end of the finger has become gangrenous, and the necrosed end of the second phalanx is seen projecting through the soft parts. The last two joints of the fingers had been quite gangrenous,

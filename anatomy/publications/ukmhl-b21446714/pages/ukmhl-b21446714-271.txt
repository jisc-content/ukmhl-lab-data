Enlargement from Pus-forming Organisms. 239 6. 90. Thickening- of the Femur from Chronic Suppura- tive Ostitis.—Eight femur—macerated, showing the above. The bone is much curved forwards near its lower end, and is correspondingly flattened from side to side. The posterior aspect of the bone is very rough and irregular, but the surface elsewhere is smooth, except where there are impressions left by blood-vessels. This seems to have been a case where chronic ostitis had led to softening and yielding of the bone, with sub- sequent solidification. "W. C. G. 34 6. 91. Great Thickening- and Irregularity of the Surface of the Femur, from Chronic Suppurative Osteo- myelitis.—Eight femur, in section, showing the above. There is great thickening of the bone and extraordinary irregularity of its surface. Along the back, and on all aspects of the upper third, the surface is thrown out into large irregular pro- cesses and plates, a condition which is also seen, to a less extent, along the front, The medullary cavity is completely filled up by cancellated tissue, except for about an inch near the upper end. At the junction of the upper and middle thirds the new bone shows several irregular cavities communicating posterially with the surface. These have probably been due to localised suppuration or minute necroses. One or two similar cavities are seen scattered throughout the bones. (J. & 1000. 6.92^ Great Thickening of the Femur from Chronic Suppurative Osteo-myelitis.-Eigkt femur in section- macerated, showing the above. There is very great enlargement of the shaft of the bone with some dilatation of the medullary cavity near the lower end. The surface of the bone along the back and at the muscular attachments of the trochanters is irregular, and the vascular channels are greatly enlarged all over. The wall of the shaft is almost entirely composed of cancellated tissue. B. C. i. 5. M. 26.

A sequestrum removed from the tibia is fixed by a thread to the fibula. A bridge of bone formerly lay over the large newly formed bone cavity, in which the necrosis was lodged. This bridge was cut across by the surgeon in order to extract the necrosis The vascularity of the new bone is shown by the injection.

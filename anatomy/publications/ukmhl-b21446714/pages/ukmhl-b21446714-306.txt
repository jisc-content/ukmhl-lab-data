274 Diseases of Bone. Presented by Professor James Russell. infiltrated with pus, and the head has necrosed and formed several separate fragments. This specimen illustrates septic caries and necrosis of the cancellated tissue, with necrosis also of the compact tissue. G. C. 982. 6. 182. Septic Osteo-myelitis and commencing" Necrosis after Scalp Wound.—Calvarium (with permanent frontal suture)—macerated, illustrating the above. A large, smooth area of what seems to have been necrosed bone in an early stage of separation is seen on the front, chiefly on the left side. There is a shallow line of demarcation marked off round it. G. C. 912. 6. 183. Septic Osteo-myelitis and commencing'Necrosis of the Skull after severe Scalp Wound.—Skull-cap- macerated, illustrating the above. "This man had his scalp torn off the skull. It was replaced. Suppuration under the scalp followed, and he died finally of suppura- tion of the membranes of the brain." The dead portion is smooth, and round it the bone is porous from the enlargement of vascular channels. On the interior, especially along the middle line, marks of increased vascularity are visible. B. C. i. 2. M. 14. e. 6.184. Septic Osteo myelitis and Necrosis of the Skull, following- a Scalp Wound.—Left half of a calvarium— macerated, illustrating the above. There is a small scale of necrosed bone in process of separation upon the front of the parietal bone below the temporal ridge. F. P. C. 477.

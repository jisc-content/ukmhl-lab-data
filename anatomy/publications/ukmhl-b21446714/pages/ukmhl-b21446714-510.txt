Diseases of Joints. 478 On the front of the humerus, the two small portions of necrotic bone are seen, partially separated by the surrounding granulations. G. C. 3237. Presented by J. M. Cotteiull, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 136. Tubercular Synovitis, involving- the Bone.—Lower end of a left humerus—macerated, illustrating the above. The articular surface is rarefied and much wasted, and shows an excavation on the outer side. Some new bone has been thrown out on the condyles. B. C. n. M. 54. 7. 137. Tubercular Synovitis, involving- chiefly the Radius and Ulna.—Adjacent halves of a left bumerus, radius, and ulna—macerated, illustrating the above. The disease was of many years standing, and the limb was am- putated by Professor Ballingall by the double flap method. The patient was dismissed within a fortnight, with the wound healed by first intention. The articular surface of the humerus is rarefied and eroded at places. The articular surface of the ulna is rarefied and irregular, being excavated in many places. Tbe changes, how- ever, are most advanced in the radius. The interior of the head of that bone is for the most part absorbed. Tbe upper articular surface has necrosed, and, although still in position, is separate from the surrounding bone. These changes seem to be advanced stages of those seen in previous specimens. G- C. 905. b. Changes primarily or chiefly in the Bone. 7. 138. Senile Tuberculosis affecting the Bones of the ElbOW.—Section of the right elbow of an old man—injected, and in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient, although aged 81, was wiry and strong.

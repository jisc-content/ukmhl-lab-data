x Preface,. underlies the classification here adopted, is that enunciated by Lister* in 1858, and emphasised afterwards by Cohnheim, Burdon Sanderson, and others, namely, that Inflammation is not so much a disease in itself as a consequence of inter- ference with the vitality of the tissues. Causation of Inflammation has therefore been chosen as the basis of primary subdivision, and the modes of interference with vitality, or causes of Inflammation, are thus the distinguishing features of the larger groups. Although it is difficult to conceive how much we may still have to learn on this subject, the knowledge acquired in recent years seems sufficient to justify the plan adopted, even should it require to be afterwards modified. As it stands, this plan carries with it at least two distinct advantages. Museum specimens are by its means arranged in accordance with present clinical and pathological knowledge. This is obvious, but in addition the confusion which has so frequently arisen from a " cross classification" has been avoided. Such headings as " Necrosis," " Periostitis," and " Syphilis " are commonly used as co-ordinate yet distinct subdivisions of bone disease; but as the first indicates " result," the second " locality," and the third " causation," the groups are not mutually exclusive, and uncertainty and con- fusion is the necessary consequence. The place for " result" as a basis of subdivision of diseased bones seems to be within each of the larger;groups formed upon the basis of "causa- tion," to which it thus becomes of subsidiary importance. In the case of Syphilitic diseases of bone, those of the * Philosophical Transactions, 1858.

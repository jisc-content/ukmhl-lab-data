Septic Osteo-myelitis of the Skull, following Injury. —Part of the frontal bone of a " scrofulous boy "—macerated —showing a trephine opening and an irregular aperture from disease-. In consequence of a blow the bone became inflamed and carious, and the trephine was applied "to evacuate the matter." On the outside the irregular, worm-eaten appearance resembles the effect of tuberculosis, but the new bone thrown out on the inside round the apertures more resembles the effect of septic irritation. Gr. C. 990. 3. 45. Septic Osteo-myelitis of the Skull, following Injury. —Portion of a right parietal bone, with the adjacent part of the occipital bone—macerated—showing the effect which followed an injury to the head. There has evidently been septic osteo-myelitis, followed by necrosis. Most of the dead bone has been separated, but a small piece in process of separation still remains. The results of inflammation are much more numerous on the outer than on the inner aspect of the bone. The patient has been trephined as in the cases from which several of the previous specimens were taken. G. C. 595. 3. 46. Healed Fracture of the Skull.—Vault and part of the base of a skull, with an extensive old-standing fracture which had healed. The marks of a fissure healed by bone are seen in the left half of the frontal bone and in the right parietal bone. In the line of the fissure, at the right side of the coronal suture, there

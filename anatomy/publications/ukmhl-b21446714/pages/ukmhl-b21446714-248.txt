216 Diseases of Bone. 6. 36. Distortion of the Pelvis from Rickets.—Pelvis of a rickety person—macerated, to show the above. The pelvis is flattened from before backwards, especially on the right side. This want of symmetry has probably been due to lateral curvature. The sacrum is straight at the upper part, and bends acutely forwards at the junction of its third and fourth pieces. "Interesting as connected with the operations of Midwifery." The bones are small, but ossification is complete. B. C. i. 3. M. 26. 6. 37. Distortion of the Lower Limb from Rickets.—Skeleton of the left leg of the same rickety person from whom the speci- mens 6. 32 and 6. 33 were taken—macerated, to show the above. The bones are stunted in growth, bent, and relatively enlarged at the ankle and knee. The neck of the femur is bent so that the great trochanter is higher than the head. The shaft is curved, with the convexity of the bend directed forwards and outwards, and flattened as usual from side to side. The tibia and fibula towards their lower ends are markedly bent. The curvature is also directed forwards, and has, besides lateral flattening, a development of bone in the concavity of the arch. Kelative to the lower end of the tibia, the foot is in the position of extreme flexion. B- C- L 3- M> 3L 6. 38. Distortion of the Lower Limb from Rickets.-Skeleton of the right lower limb, from the same patient as the preceding —macerated, showing corresponding changes. B. C. i. 3. M. 33. 6. 39. Distortion of the Leg from Rickets.-Plaster cast of a right leg, showing the above. The patient was a boy aged about 14 years.

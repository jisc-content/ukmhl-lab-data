Tuberculosis of Sacro-iliac Joint. 463 7. 95. Tubercular Disease of the Knee-joint—Erasion.— Suppurative Osteomyelitis of the Femur.—Section of the lower end of the femur and knee-joint of a child—in spirit, illustrating the above. About two years before amputation, the child had suffered from tubercular knee-joint disease, for which erasion had been performed. The femur had afterwards been the seat of acute osteomyelitis, ending in necrosis, for which amputation became necessary. The section shows a large sequestrum of the shaft of the femur, surrounded by a very thick shell of new bone. The epiphysis of the femur is seen beneath the patella. It is separated from the shaft by a layer of fibrous tissue behind, and by a large gap in front, which communicated with the sequestrum. The original cavity of the knee-joint is now occupied by fibrous tissue. G. C. 3458. Presented by John Duncan, F.R.C.S.E. Sacro-iliac joint. 7. 96. Tubercular and Septic Disease of the Sacro-iliac Joint.—Pelvis of an adult, macerated—showing extensive destruction of the right sacro-iliac joint. The case is said to have been one of psoas abscess. The sacrum and ilium in the neighbourhood of the joint are much eroded, and very irregular. The acetabula are very shallow, and all round the pelvis, but especially on the right ilium, there are numerous irregular outgrowths of bone. W. C. H. 61. Hip-joint. a. Changes primarily or chiefly in the synovial membrane. 7. 97. Tubercular Synovitis.— A left hip-joint laid open —in spirit, illustrating the above. On the head of the femur shreddy granulations" replace the cartilage over the central portion, and at the margins. In

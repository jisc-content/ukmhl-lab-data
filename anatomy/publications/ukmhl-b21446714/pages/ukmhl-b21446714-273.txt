241 Bone Abscess. The lower end of the tibia is much enlarged, and there is a cavity in the interior extending half-way up the bone, but partially interrupted by cancellous tissue. The enlarged part of the bone has been trephined, and the upper end of the cavity has been reached, but drainage has evidently been incomplete, for the lower portion of the cavity communicates by only a narrow aperture with the trephine hole, and is enlarged. The periosteal thickening of the tibia corresponds to the cavity inside. The fibula is enlarged about its middle, and especially on the inner aspect. Q 3212 Fresentecl by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. . 97. Abscess in the Lower End of the Tibia.—Left tibia, in section, and fibula—macerated, showing the above. The surface of the tibia on the lower two-thirds shows- considerable alteration. A large node-like swelling is seen in front, about the middle. Below this there is a considerable deficiency, with an aperture leading from it into a cavity situated above the lower articular surface. The walls of the cavity are lined by cancellated tissue, with only slight thicken- ing round the sides. The bone tissue however, above and below the cavity, is condensed. The upper end of the bone seems normal. The fibula is thickened near the affected part of the tibia. The appearances are not typical of an ordinary bone abscess, and the condition may have been tubercular. F. P. C. 423. 98.

See Sir Charles Bell on " Spine and Thigh Bone," plate v. fig. 2. 6. 119. Acute Suppurative Osteo myelitis of the Femur- Necrosis.—Portion of a femur—macerated, to show the above. A rough piece of necrosed bone is surrounded by a nearly complete case of irregular new bone. At one part the new case is deficient and the sequestrum exposed. At other places cloacae are seen. On the side opposite the deficiency an attempt was made to destroy the new bone by the actual cautery, in order to remove the sequestrum. The black burned part has no doubt been killed, and has been in process of separation from the rest as is indicated by the sulcus round it. B. C. i. 5. M. 33. 6. 120. Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis—Necrosis, Chronic Enlargement.—Section of a part of a femur— macerated, illustrating the above. The new bone in most places is as dense as ivory, while at other parts it is cancellous. Several cloacal apertures communi- cate between the surface and the cavities within. In one of these cavities a loose fragment of dead bone is seen. The others have probably contained similar fragments, which have dropped out. The walls of the cavities are porous, and might be called carious. They have been covered with granulations, from which suppuration has come. The outer surface of the bone presents the usual irregular character seen in such cases due to the active development of new periosteal bone. This specimen shows by the density of the new bone how extremely difficult it is in some cases to remove enclosed sequestra. B. C. i. 5- M. 40.

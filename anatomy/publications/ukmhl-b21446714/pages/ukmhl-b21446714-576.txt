Diseases of Muscles, Tendons, etc. 544 phragni, formerly described as "a peculiar condensed state of the diaphragm "—in spirit. The condition seems to be one of great thickening—possibly tubercular—on the peritoneal aspect of the diaphragm, while the muscular fibre seems pale and firm. Possibly the peritoneal thickening may have interfered with the movements of the muscle, and so led to its degeneration. G. C. 611. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 9. 6. Degeneration of Muscles of Arm.—Transverse section of a forearm—in spirit, illustrating the above. "The integuments were indurated and tuberculated from the middle of the arm to that of the forearm, and the elbow and muscles of the forearm rigid. The hand and lower part of the extremity were much swollen and cedematous. On the forearm was a considerable ulcer, with abrupt ragged edges and foul surface. "The arm was amputated close to the shoulder joint, where the parts appear sound, but after some months a similar disease attacked the cicatrix of the stump, and gradually extended till the patient died." " The section exhibits the skin much thickened and having the appearance of scirrhus; the muscles appear for the most part converted into a white substance like cartilage, retaining to a certain degree the fibrous form of muscle; in other parts the muscle is seen pale, as if gradually passing into the cartilaginous state. The adipose and cellular membrane have disappeared, so that the muscles appear to be matted to each other, and to the diseased skin. The larger nerves and blood-vessels are seen passing through the parts unchanged." This may have been a general tuberculosis of the skin, with degeneration of muscle following disuse. G. C. 221.

Syphilitic Necrosis. 299 c. Where the chief changes are in the form of necrosis. 6. 252. Syphilitic ("Mercurial") Disease of the Skull.— Portion of the left half of the skull-cap—macerated, illustrat- ing the above. An irregular smooth patch in front of the parietal eminence is almost entirely surrounded by irregular depressions, which seem to be enlargements from dilated vascular channels. Similar but less advanced stages of the same process are seen behind this large patch. On the inside a certain amount of increased vascularity is traceable. The diploe is partially filled up, and the bone as a whole is increased in weight. The cranial sutures are nearly obliterated. jr p. c. 317 Presented by Professor John Thomson. 6.253. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull, advancing- to Necrosis.—Skull-cap of an old person—macerated, illustrating the above. There are patches of roughened surface on the frontal and parietal bones, but most marked on the right side, where the opened-out vascular channels have been in many places enlarged into irregular pits. Near the right parietal eminence irregular trenches are marked out round portions of the bone. At one -place below, the trench communicates with the interior. On the inside of the skull the bone shows enlarged vascular channels all over, but most marked opposite the patches affected on the outside. Near the inner aspect of the right parietal eminence the bone is almost entirely eaten through over an area smaller than, but similar in shape to, that on the outside. B. C. i. 7. M. 12. 6. 254.

Diseases of Joints. 440 The early history of this case is more like that of acute suppurative osteo-myelitis, but the later condition is evidently tubercidar, although complicated by sepsis. G. C. 3239. 7. 35. Tubercular Synovitis, involving' the Cartilage and Bone.—Articular ends of the femur and tibia—in spirit—from which the previous cast was taken. The specimen shows the granulations—now shrivelled and blanched—covering the greater part of the articular surfaces; also pockets in the synovial membrane of the femur, containing tubercular granulations, and extending upwards towards the thigh. The section has been carried through the necrosed fragments of the inner condyle, and through the inner head of the tibia. There is no evidence of former disease in the head of the tibia. G. C. 3240. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 36. Tubercular Synovitis, involving the Cartilage and Bone. Portions of the inner condyle and head of the tibia of the previous specimen—sawn off and macerated. The saw has been carried through the smooth, bare bone on the inner condyle of the femur. The underlying interior of the bone shows little or no change. In the tibia the section has passed through the part formerly affected, but, as in the non-macerated part, there is no sign of previous disease. G- G- 33^1- Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 37. Tubercular Synovitis of the Knee, with Patch of Necrosis on the Inner Condyle.-Lower end of a left femur —in spirit—section sawn out, to illustrate the above.

169 Gunshot Fractures of the Tibia. " There was here, of course, a breach of the capsule of the joint. The consequences were great swelling of the whole extremity, matter in a cavity of the knee-joint, and a diffused abscess under the gastro-cnemii. The limb was properly amputated. This was from Corunna. It led me to expect what I saw afterwards at Waterloo " (Sir Charles Bell). * It should be noted that the wound of entrance is smaller than the bullet, also that the wound of exit is the larger and more irregular of the two. Some splinters of bone have been loosened at the wound of exit, and a fissure extends down- wards for about four inches. See Sir C. Bell's "Operative Surgery," pi. ii. fig. 2, and pi. xi. B.

The inner tuberosity, which had been shot off, is wired in position. The specimen was taken from a soldier who fought at Waterloo. The ball has apparently penetrated from within outwards, and has also split off the inner tuberosity. The bone in the track of the bullet has been necrotic, and evidently inflammation and suppuration have attacked the knee-joint. The articular- surface is rough and opened out, and the surface of the bone generally is in a similar condition. F. P. C. 244 Presented by Professor John Thomson. •3.355.

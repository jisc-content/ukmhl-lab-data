xii Preface. disease of bone; and, again, many diseases of stumps are really only diseases of the bone. In such cases the specimens have been placed in what seemed the more important group, and representative specimens, or cross references, have been put in the other group to which they may be considered also to belong. The subdivision of the fourth group, Tumours, or New (Growths, is based upon the view that they are essentially modi- fications of growth, and not merely responses to irritation; further, that they take their type from the tissue from which they arise, and that they vary in their rate of growth and degree of malignancy. Consequently, no attempt has been made to form a general group of "Tumours," but instead, each Pathological Series has its department for "Tumours," just as it has for " Inflammations " of various kinds. The order in which the' individual specimens have been arranged within the groups has been based upon the following general principles. Among Fractures the larger groups have, as is usual, been based upon "locality," i.e., the bone, or special part of it which has been broken. Within the groups thus formed, the speci- mens have been classed as recent, and of old standing, and the latter again as united or ununited. Other groups of injuries have been similarly treated. Among Malformations, the lesser degrees have been placed before those more pronounced. In Inflammations, early stages of disease have been placed before those more advanced, in order to illustrate the successive phases of the particular malady. These have been followed,

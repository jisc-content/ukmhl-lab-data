It was hanging by a thread at birth, and was separated by a snip with scissors, without bleeding. No cause for the condition could be traced in the arrangement of the umbilical cord or otherwise. The infant was one of triplets. A process of intra-uterine mummification seems to have extended nearly to the elbow. G. C. 2833. Presented by G. M. Johnston, M.D., 1888. Stumps after Amputation. a.

George M , aged 26, had his arm crushed by a stone weighing about 30 cwt., which was lowered too rapidly while he was smoothing the mortar for its bed. The forearm and elbow-joint were severely injured. A local doctor bandaged the arm, and the patient arrived at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, at about 7 p.m. on 19th August 1890. Mr Cathcart amputated the limb 3£ or 4 inches above the condyles. About 1st September, when the wound was nearly healed, the patient showed signs of tetanus. On the morning of September 3rd Mr Cathcart performed Spence's amputation at the shoulder-joint. The tetanic spasms, which had been very severe, improved for a time, and the patient fell asleep at 1 p.m. He woke, however, at 1.45 p.m., and after three spasms, died in a fourth, which was prolonged. The end of the median nerve is slightly enlarged, the end of the brachial artery has been filled by a clot, and its termination has been surrounded by organising lymph. The wound had almost entirely healed, and the section shows how the skin had covered in the cut end of the muscle. G. C. 3204. Presented by Chaiiles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1890. 11. 83.

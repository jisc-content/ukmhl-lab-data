Six months before coming to Hospital she had "acute rheumatism" (tuberculosis?) which did not affect the joints of the right wrist, although it attacked almost all her other joints. She believed she had twisted this wrist while turning in bed when suffering from the "rheumatism." The wrist and hand gradually became swollen, painful, and unnaturally movable. Fluctuation ensued. Amputation was performed above the wrist. A week later she had severe pain in her head. There was no phthisis, but death occurred shortly afterwards from general tuberculosis. No post-mortem examination was obtained. There are caseous deposits in many of the carpal bones and in the bases of the metacarpals. Some of these centres are surrounded by a vascular area, and in some cases the caseation has spread from one adjacent bone to another. At some places the bones are softened, vascular, and broken down. In many places the cartilage has disappeared, having been chiefly attacked from within. The non-vascular portion of the radial side of the unciform consists of hard dense bone, in the others the non-vascular PC 3072 portion is caseous and soft. Presented by A. G.

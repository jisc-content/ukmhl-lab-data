Syphilitic Necrosis. 303 6. 260. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull, ending- in Necrosis. —Portion of skull, upper and back parts wanting—macerated, illustrating the above. There has been extensive destruction of the frontal and nasal bones. On the outer surface the parts not necrosed are roughened from increased vascularity. Almost the whole of the frontal region is occupied by a roughened seques- trum, which seems to have been detached and only held in place during life by the soft parts, for it is now glued into position. Its surface is roughened by apparently recent and old-standing changes, similar to those already described, and part of the surface seems to have been detached as a superficial necrosis. All round it there is a groove, which, however,' has not penetrated through the inner table, and the margins of which for the most part overhang. The frontal sinuses are exposed, but their mesial septum remains. The bones forming the bridge and sides of the nose are wanting, and the ethmoidal and maxillary sinuses are freely exposed. The vomer is deficient, and.there is a large gap near the front of the hard palate The interior of the roof of the skull is roughened by marks of dilated blood-vessels, but to a less extent than might have been expected from the changes on the outside. Only at one spot- near the middle line in front-has the process of necrosis penetrated into the interior. On the base of the skull the bony ridges are sharp and strongly marked, both inside and outside. The section of the skull in the parietal and occipital region* is extremely thick, and the diploe is everywhere replaced by compact bone.

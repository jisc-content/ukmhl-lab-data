Thickening- of the Surface of, the Tibia with Absorption of the Interior, probably from Chronic Suppurative Osteo-myelitiS.-Lowei end of a right tibia —macerated, showing the above. There has been a considerable crust of new periosteal bone on the surface, which has been, however, partly broken off. The original surface of the bone is porous, and at places has r C 1147 been opened into small holes. yj- Presented by Professor James Russell. d. Where the changes in the bone tissue have resulted in an abscess. 6. 94. Abscess in the Lower End of the Radius.-Lower end of a left radius-macerated, showing the above. Above the articular surface there is considerable enlarge- ment and hollowing out of the interior, probably due to chronic suppuration. Three cloacal apertures communicate with the inside, and through them pieces of rarefied and apparently necrotic bone can be seen. The surface has h ^1, character of newly-formed bone when due to the irritation of suppurative organisms. *>• U °- ■ ' 6. 95. Abscess in the Lower End of the Femur.-Left femur macerated, to show the above. The lower half of the bone is greatly enlarged by new and irregular formation on the surface. The interior is hollowed out and formerly contained fragments of necrosed bone.

Development of Bone. 21 2. 14. Ossification Of Bone.—Section of the femur and tibia— in spirit—from a young pig which had been fed on madder for six weeks before it was killed. The last-formed portions of bone are stained pink. Thus the new deposit is seen at the epiphysial end of shafts, slightly under the periosteum, and just perceptibly below the articular cartilage of the femur and tibia at the knee. B. C. 1. 1ST. 29. 2. 15. Growth of Bone.—Section of the femur of a young pig which had been fed on madder—macerated and dried. On the outer aspect a faint pinkish stain is seen over the whole bone. In the interior the centre of the shaft is white, but the epiphysial ends are slightly stained, as are also the interior of the epiphyses, only less so. G. C. 2659. 2. 16. Growth of Bone.—Section of head of a young pig which had been fed on madder. The soft parts are cleared away, except near the nose. The madder colouring has faded, but a pinkish tint is still seen in many places. G. C. 2749. 2. 17. Ossification in Membrane.—Parietal bone of an infant— injected with vermilion and in spirit—showing the bony spicules and blood-vessels radiating out from a centre of ossification. "\y. C. F. 18. DEVELOPMENT IN PARTICULAR. 2.18. Development Of Skeleton.—Skeleton of human foetus, between the third and fourth month—dried—to show the amount of bone-laid down at this period. B. C. 1. 1ST. 86.

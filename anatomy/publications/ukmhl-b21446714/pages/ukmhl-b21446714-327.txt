Syphilitic ' Caries.' 295 maxillary, and left malar bones. The frontal bone is the most affected. Between the frontal eminences there is a large patch where the surface is roughened and in places eaten away. The roughness is due to the opening out of vascular channels. From this patch extensions pass down to the external angular processes, and some tissue is lost at a corresponding part above each orbit. The rest of the vault of the skull shows changes similar to those seen on the frontal bone, only less marked. The bones of the skull are not thickened but the diploe is con- densed. The left malar and superior maxillary bones are roughened on their facial aspect, partly by new periosteal bone, and partly by the opening out of vascular channels. A slight degree of the same change is seen on the right superior maxillary and malar bones. B. C. i. 7. M. 22. 6. 243. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.—Skull and lower jaw of a negro—macerated, illustrating the above. At the right frontal eminence and below the left one there is considerable loss of the surface from erosion, and possibly from superficial necrosis. On the left side the skull is also perforated. Round these places there are the usual pores due to increased vascularity, which have been opened out into irregular pits here and there. A somewhat similar condition is seen on the lower jaw, below and behind each mental foramen. Some roughness is seen on the malar and superior maxillary bones. In the interior of the skull there are marks of increased vascularity at various places, but especially on the frontal bone. The skull, as a whole, seems thick, and the sutures are distinct. B.

125 Fractures of the Femur. cede and follow it renders more probable the theory of old- standing fracture. The lower part of the shaft shows signs of a slight perios- titis. B. C. i. 1. M. 32. a. 3. 223. United Fracture a little below the Lesser Tro- chanter.—Left femur of an aged man—macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment has been tilted outwards and slightly forwards, and the level of the head is below that of the great trochanter. There is much thickening round the fracture, extending downwards in the shaft. The broken ends have been hidden in front by the callus, but are still distinct behind. The lower end of the shaft preserves its normal forward bend, but, as in the former case, the inner condyle is prolonged downwards, and there has probably been knock-knee. The whole bone is lightened, probably, however, from advanced age. The articular surfaces show changes indicative of arthritis deformans. B. C. i. 1. M. 32. b. 3. 224. Badly united Fracture a little below the Lesser Trochanter.—Eight femur of an adult—macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment is tilted greatly outwards, and is displaced behind the lower one. The head of the bone is on a level with the great trochanter, and the whole shaft has had an outward bend at the seat of fracture, which is only partially compensated for by a slight bend inwards at the lower end. The inner condyle is prolonged downwards, and there has evidently been knock-knee. The bone, although not thickened, is unusually heavy. From the rounding off of the prominences at the seat of fracture, and from the evidently secondary changes in the lower end of the shaft, the fracture, may be considered one of long standing. B.

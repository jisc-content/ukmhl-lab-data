Fibrous Tumours. 553 9. 31. Soft FibPOUS Tumour.—Section of a small subcutaneous tumour, similar to the last—in spirit. This was also formerly described as "simple sarcoma." Its structure, as altered by the spirit, seems fairlyjiniform. G. C. 105. rrcscnUd by Professor Joiin Thomson. 9. 32. Firm Fibrous Tumour.—Section of a large lobulated and seemingly encapsulated tumour—in spirit. It was removed from below the right pectoralis minor, from a patient in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. The section has a somewhat "• watered-silk" appearance by interlacing of firmer and laxer portions of fibrous tissue. Although for the most part encapsuled, it seems, at places above, to involve the adjacent muscular fibre. G. C. 201. Presented by A. Gillespie, F.R.C.S.E. Fibro-Sarcomatous Tumours. 9. 33. Fibro-Sareomatous Tumour.—Sections of two large tumours removed from the right inguinal region—in spirit. The patient was a healthy man, about forty. Two and a-half years before the operation a small lump had appeared in the groin. It had grown slowly in the line of the groin, extending both towards and away from the middle line. In about six months from its first appear- ance it had passed into the scrotum, and for about four months after that it had not altered much. In its later growth it had projected more and more forwards. The patient worked up to within a few days of the operation without his fellow-workers knowing that there was anything wrong with him, although the bulk of the tumour had somewhat inter- fered with his stooping. There were no abnormal sensations in left leg ; he could move it as well as the other. The tumour surface was smooth, but could be recognised to be made up of four or five masses. On the summit there were several small reddened elevations. The main mass below felt quite firm and hard, but the smaller upper portions were softer. There was no pain on pressure.

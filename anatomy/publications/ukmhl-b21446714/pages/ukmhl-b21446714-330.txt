298 Diseases of Bone. the skull shows marks of increased vascularity, especially in the frontal hone, where there has also heen some thickening. The frontal bone where sawn is considerably thickened and condensed. B. C. i. 7. M. 7. 6. 250. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.—Skull of an adult man—macerated, illustrating the above. The whole of the outside of the skull is roughened and irregular. On the right side the changes seem to have been of long standing and are partially healed. The lower part of the parietal bone has irregular tubercles smoothed over, and the surrounding bone has few vascular channels. On the corre- ponding part on the left side and in front there are also similar tubercles, but their margins are sharper and the bone round is more porous. The whole of the top of the skull is porous, and at places the apertures are opened out into irregular erosions. There is, in fact, scarcely any part of the external surface of the cranial bones which is not changed by an early or receding stage of the opening-out process. Most of the facial bones show similar changes. On the left eminentia articularis- there is a smooth undermined and partially separated scale of bone, as if a layer of the articular surface had been necrosed. On the inside of the skull, except on the anterior and middle fossa?, the surface is roughened by the development of new bone and by the enlargement of vascular channels. B. C. i. 7. M. 21. b. Where the chief changes are in the form of enlargement. 6. 251. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.—Portion of a left frontal bone—macerated, illustrating the above. The outer surface shows several eminences, the surfaces of which are porous. The section shows the bone to be thickened, the texture being at some places rarefied and at others sclerosed W 0 (? 39 in irregular patches. vv • '

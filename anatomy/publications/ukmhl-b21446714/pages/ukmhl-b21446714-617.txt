585 Knock-knee. peroneus longus tendons are filled up. Both feet, but especially the left, have been in a condition of talipes varus. On the outer side of the os calcis the groove for the peroneus longus is unduly prominent, especially on the right side, where new bone has been formed round it. The whole of the bones, but especially those of the left side, are light, soft, and greasy. G. C. 3489. Presented by A. Miles, F.R.C.S.E., 1893. . 48. Genu-Valgum.—Left femur of an adult—macerated, illus- trating the above. The bone has been mounted in a nearly vertical position. The inner condyle is relatively much lower than the outer. The increased quantity of bone on the inside is apparently just above the condyle. The centre of the articular surface of the condyle is similar. The upper end of the shaft is flattened from before backwards, and a strong ridge leads down from the neck along the inner side of the shaft. The neck itself is unusually horizontal. B. C. i. i. M. 21. 49. Hammer Toe.—Toe and section of a toe—in spirit, illustrating the above. Both are in the condition known as hammer toe. The first inter-phalangeal joint is strongly flexed, and the other is extended. The head of the first phalanx is exposed, and the skin over it has been irritated by the pressure of the boot. The distal end of the soft parts of the toe is greatly enlarged in each case. G. C. 3243. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E., 1891. 50. Elephantiasis of Leg.—Plaster cast of the left foot and part of leg of a negro, affected with elephantiasis. The limb has been so enormously swollen, and the skin has become so thick and rough, that the appearance of a human foot

17 Degenerations and Infiltrations. Portion of a testicle in which a caseating syphilitic deposit had formed—injected and in spirit. The yellow caseating substance is shown in strong relief from the injected tissue round about it, and it may be noted that the vascularity is greatest in the neighbourhood of the caseation. 6. C. 3154. 1. 58. Calcareous Infiltration.—Portion of two large arteries in which the middle coats have been infiltrated with lime salts —cleaned and dried. The calcareous plates stand out from the surrounding parts, and it may be seen in many places that the calcareous deposit follows the direction of the circular fibres of the middle coat. G. C. 3155. 1. 59. Pigmentary Infiltration.—Portion of lung from a case of anthracosis. The excessive deposit of carbon in the lung has caused many parts of it to be as black as soot. Pleurisy has been set up, and the costal and pulmonary surfaces of the pleura are closely matted together. G. C. 3153. 1. 60. Pigmentation from Chronic Congestion.—Portion of skin from the front of a tubercular knee, which had been frequently blistered. The skin was removed in excision of the joint, and shows a deep pigmentation, such as results from frequent congestions from any cause. G. C. 3340. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E., 1892.

Congenital Malformations. 577 The specimen shows the relation of parts in a case where the tibia was congenially absent. The lower end of the femur is rounded, and had no articulation except with the patella. The fibula is well formed and straight. The astragalus is altered in shape, and articulates with the lower end of the fibula. The foot is twisted inwards, and the heel is drawn up as in talipes equino-varus. The muscles and tendons are fairly well developed. q q 3369_ Presented by John Thomson, M.D., 1891. 11. 19.

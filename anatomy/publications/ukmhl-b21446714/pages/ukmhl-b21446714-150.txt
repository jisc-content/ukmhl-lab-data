118 Injuries of Bone. vertebra, pelvis, and femora—macerated, showing the above. The bones on the fractured side are placed in the position in which they were found on dissection. The fracture is of the impacted extra-capsular variety. It will be seen that the great trochanter has been split, and that one of the fragments, along with the shaft of the bone, has been drawn up to the crest of the ilium. The head and neck remain in their normal position. B. C. I. 1. M. 17. 3. 204. Ununited Impacted Extracapsular Fracture of the Neck, with great Displacement.—Plaster of Paris cast of a left innominate bone, and the upper end of the corresponding femur, showing the above. As in the last specimen, the great trochanter has been drawn up to the crest of the ilium. The connection between the upper end of the shaft and the ilium was not composed of bone, as it seems to be in the cast. The appearance of bony union is due to a fault in the cast.

United Extra-capsular Fracture and Ununited Intracapsular Fracture of the Neck, with Arthritis DeformanS-Upper end of a right femur-macerated, show- ing the above. The appearances presented by this specimen are remarkable and unusual. The lower fragment at its upper end has all the appearance of a healed impacted extra-capsular fracture of the type seen in Nos. 3.199 and 3.200, to the latter of winch it has a considerable resemblance. But there is also an ununited fracture of the neck, as well as changes in the upper fragment such as are produced by arthritis deformans. It is highh probable that arthritis deformans followed the impacted extra-

Diseases of Connective Tissue. 566 Presented by Charles W. Cathcatvt, F.K.C.S.E., 1891. This is most probably the cast from the patient from whom the previous two specimens were obtained. It must have been taken not long before his death, and after the tumour had recurred for the fifth and last time. A cause of uncertainty, however, is that this tumour is on the right side, whereas the previous specimens were described originally as having been above the left haunch. Possibly, however, the tumour in its recurrence had attacked chiefly the right side, or there may have been a misprint. G. C. 3502. 9. 64. Recurrent Fibroid Tumour, which became dissem- inated.—Papier-mache cast of a tumour in the groin before its removal for the third time from the same place. Mrs B., aged 55, received a blow above the right knee. Five months afterwards (June 1879) a tumour of the size of an orange was removed from the injured place ; another tumour was removed from the same place in June 1881 ; another in January 1883 ; and a fourth in May 1883. There was no return above the knee, but from the groin a similar tumour was removed in June 1883, a second from the groin was removed in November 1883, and a third (of which this is a cast) in June 1884. While the wound from the last (seventh) operation was healing, numerous nodules appeared in the subcutaneous tissue at various parts of the body, and some could be felt within the abdomen. The patient died shortly afterwards, and at the post-mortem examination nodules of sarcoma we're found in the liver, lungs, and heart, and in many parts of the subcutaneous tissue. G. C. 2738.

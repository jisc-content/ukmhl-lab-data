334 Diseases of Bone. A large mass of rough and irregular bone near the middle of the shin surface has apparently been a sequestrum in process of separation, and has no doubt lain exposed on the floor of an ulcer. Below this the bone is porous, as if it had formed the base of an extending ulcer, and below this again there is a raised mass of periosteal bone, which is penetrated here and there by roughened apertures. The rest of the surface of the tibia is rough from new periosteal bone formation. The section of the bone shows a small central necrosis near the upper end. Above this piece there is an excavation of the head of the tibia, and below it the greater part of the medullary cavity is occupied by cancellated tissue. G- C. 1179. a.

The specimen shows a rickety bend, with syphilitic nodes on the surface. The bend is chiefly seen at the upper end, and is an exaggeration of the normal curve, such as is usually seen in rickets. The nodes occupy the front and outer part of the shaft, and bear a close resemblance to the syphilitic nodes seen in previous specimens. B- c- *< 5- M- 5L 6. 347. Syphilis and Rickets of the Femur.-Bight femur- macerated, illustrating the above. The normal bend of the shaft is exaggerated above, and a node, has apparently been developed about the same place. This somewhat resembles the previous specimen, and may be considered to have been a slight case of rickets to which TT P. C. 603. syphilis has been superadded. Presented by Professor Joun Thomson.

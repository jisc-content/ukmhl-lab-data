The Limbs as a Whole. 578 From a young woman, aged 18. There was no family history of deformity. At birth both the first and second toes were unusually large, and they grew much more rapidly than the others. The second toe, being the larger, was amputated in infancy. Some years before the cast was taken the great toe had ceased to grow ; but as the projection of the nail caused inconvenience, it was excised by Mr A. G. Miller. The enlargement seemed to be chiefly in the soft parts. The three outer toes arid the outer parts of the foot are apparently normal. The enlargement of the great toe extends backwards over the dorsum to about opposite the base of the first metatarsal bone. ' G. C. 2856. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1888. 11. 23.

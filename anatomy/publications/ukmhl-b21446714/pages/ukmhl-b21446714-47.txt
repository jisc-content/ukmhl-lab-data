These are seen to be small irregular swellings, containing numerous blood-vessels, which have been freely injected. The section shows that the vascularity is much greater in the outer than in the inner parts. G. C. 3075. Presented by John Duncan, F.R.C.S.E., 1889. 1. 50. Sear after Healing* by Granulation.—Portion of skin which has formed the face of a stump, which had healed up by granulation,—in spirit. The surface shows great puckering round the central scar and considerable condensation of the tissues in the deeper aspect, illustrating the large amount of fibrous tissue formed in healing by granulation as well as the contraction which ac- companies the process. W. C. Q. 52. 1. 51. Contraction from Healing by Granulation.—Plaster cast of neck and face of a man (Broggan), showing the contraction which attended the healing of an extensive burn, by granulation. The patient had been burned in childhood. The chin is brought down upon the sternum, and the lower lip has been pulled away from the mouth. Owing to the loss of support usually given by the lower lip to the lower incisor teeth, these have been pushed forward by the pressure of the tongue from within. G. 0. 3166.

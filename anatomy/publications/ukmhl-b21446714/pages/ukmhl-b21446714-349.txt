317 Syphilitic Enlargement. 6. 288. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Humerus.—Eight humerus—macerated, illustrating the above. The bone is increased in weight and thickened at its lower end. The surface of the thickened part is extremely rough from projecting processes of periosteal bone. The parts most affected correspond to the places of attachment of the triceps and brachialis anticus muscles. B. C. i. 5. M. 88. 6. 289. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Humerus.—Eight humerus—macerated, illustrating the above. The lower end is thickened, especially upon the posterior and outer surfaces. In several places an erosion of the new bone penetrates also into the old, as if an ulcer or sinus in the soft parts had extended downwards into the bone. B. C. I. 5. M. 91. 6. 290. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Radius and Ulna.— Eight radius and ulna, from the same patient as No. 6. 285— injected with vermilion, surface cleaned, and in spirit, illustrat- ing the above. Considerable irregular periosteal growth is seen on the radius, especially on the back near the two ends. On the upper end of the ulna, especially at the outer and back parts, there are patches of vascularity and crusts of new periosteal bone. B. C I 5 M 1 .291. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Ulna.—Eight ulna- macerated, illustrating the above. The upper end is greatly enlarged and irregular. Its posterior surface is also eroded and rarified, as if it had formed the base of an ulcer. The lower end of the bone and the articular surfaces are unchanged. £. q_ x ^ j£ 92

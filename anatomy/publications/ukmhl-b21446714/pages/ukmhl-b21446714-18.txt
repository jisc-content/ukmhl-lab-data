xiv Preface. Each specimen is furnished with its Series-number, fol- lowed in smaller type by its own number within the Series. These numbers are of course repeated in the Catalogue. The plan of giving to the description of each specimen a general heading in bold type has been adopted from Sir George Humphry's Catalogue of the Cambridge Museum and from the revised edition of the Catalogue of Guy's Hospital Museum. 'This heading is followed in the same paragraph by a state- ment of what the specimen is, and by an account of how it has been prepared and mounted. Next comes the clinical history in small print. Every effort has been made to obtain these histories of the specimens. The various manuscript Catalogues contain many, which were either not used at all, or only briefly abstracted in the previous Catalogue. These have now been largely drawn upon. In addition, every available clue has been followed that promised to lead to a clinical account of any of the specimens, whether in the old Infirmary records, or in the published writings of the donors of the specimens. It is to be regretted that this has been possible with only a limited number of the specimens, and it may be assumed that where no clinical history is given, none has been accessible to the present conservator.' In natural sequence after this paragraph, follow, in larger type, the descriptions of the speci- mens in their recent state (when obtainable), and as they are permanently to be seen in the Museum. Last of all are added such comments as seemed desirable. Before the donor's name, the Manuscript Catalogue number has been given to facilitate further reference if required. G.C.

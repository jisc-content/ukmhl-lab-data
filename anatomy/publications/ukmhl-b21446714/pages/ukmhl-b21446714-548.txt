516 Diseases of Joints. The vertebrse have evidently been portions of a lateral curve with its convexity to the right, and show advanced changes in the bone. At the concavity the bodies are greatly compressed, and the upper two have lost more than half their vertical diameter. The intervertebral space is narrowed. The articular processes and laminae are compressed and firmly anchy- losed together, and the adjacent parts are atrophied. It is interesting to notice that the pedicles have diminished in size along with the other parts, although the nerves on the inter- vertebral foramina must have fended off direct bony pressure from them. Possibly the pressure upon the articular processes at one end, and upon the bodies at the other end of the- pedicles, may have led to atrophy of the intervening pedicles- themselves. G- C- 986- 7. 221. Lateral Curvature—Bone Changes— Section of part of a dorsal region of the spinal column—macerated, illustrating: the above. All parts are anchylosed. The bones are greatly absorbed,, and have evidently been injured in preparation. G. C. 986. C. Changes from affections of the nervous system. See No. 6. 17. D. Changes due to conditions apparently constitutional, but more or less obscure. See Series 6 under the headings of Rickets & Osteo-Malacia. III. INFLAMMATORY DISEASES. 1. Where the inflammation is due to the action of pus-forming organisms. 2. Where the inflammation is due to the action of the tubercle bacillus— i.e. "Potts' Disease," "Angular Curvature," or "Caries of the Spine." A. Tubercular Deposits without altered curvature or loss of substance. 7. 222. Tubercular Deposits in Several Vertebrae.— Eight hid of the spinal .column, from the sixth dorsal vertebra

Injuries of Bone. 154 3. 312. Recent Severe Form of Pott's Fracture from a Crush.—Part of a right leg and foot, dissected to show the relation of parts in the above—in spirit. The patient was a mason whose foot was severely crushed by a stone. Gangrene set in, and a few days after the accident amputation of the limb became necessary. There is a comminuted fracture of the fibula just above the ankle. The inner malleolus has been broken off and comminuted. The peroneal tendons are displaced forward. Besides the above injuries, the posterior tibial artery was torn across, and the soft parts were greatly bruised. G. C. 2849. Presented by P. H. Maolaeen, Esq. 3. 313.

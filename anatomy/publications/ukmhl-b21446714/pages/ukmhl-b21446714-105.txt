Fractures of the Spine. 73 monly the case, the upper part of the spinal column is displaced in front of the lower. G. C. 1473. Presented through Sir George Ballingall by Drs Biuggs, Mudie, and Thomson of St Andrews, 1833. . 80. Fracture of the Spine in the Mid-Dorsal Region.— Fifth to ninth dorsal vertebrae—macerated and dried—showing the above injury. The seventh vertebra has suffered most of all. Its body is comminuted, its transverse processes broken off, and its laminse fractured near the pedicles. The front of the eighth body has been broken off; also the following transverse processes, the right of the fifth vertebra, both of the sixth, and the left of the eighth and ninth. The fracture has evidently been pro- duced by bending forward the spine, with the usual tendency to forward displacement of the upper fractured portion of the column. G. C. 3309. 81. Displacement forward of the ninth Dorsal Vertebra and partial Fracture of the tenth, with Crushing- of the Cord.—Section of the lower half of the ninth and of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth dorsal vertebras. The muscles are dissected off, and the preparation is mounted in spirit, to show the above injury. The patient, a miner, set. 29, was doubled forwards by a mass of earth falling upon his shoulders. He had complete loss of motion and sensation in his lower limbs. He could not make water, but the bladder emptied itself after a catheter had been inserted. A plaster jacket was applied. On the third day he had septic cystitis, very foetid urine, and considerable pain across the abdomen. On the ninth day he died of collapse, with vomiting, belcbing, and abdominal symptoms. At the post-mortem examination the bladder was found to have sloughed into the peritoneum, and his death had been due to septic peritonitis. The body of the ninth dorsal vertebra has been crushed

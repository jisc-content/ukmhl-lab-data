Diseases of Bone. 272 Presented by Professor James Russell, The small necrosed piece is in process of separation as in the previous case. Beyond the area of rarefaction there is a slight crust of new periosteal bone. F. P. C. 219. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 6. 176. Septic Osteo-myelitis following Gunshot (Com- pound) Fracture.—Portion of the upper part of a right femur, illustrating the above. The wound was received at the battle of Waterloo. This specimen shows essentially the same features as the last, but with more new periosteal bone above the line of demarcation. F. P. C. 220. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 6. 177. Septic Osteo-myelitis and Necrosis following- Com- pound Fracture.—Sections of part of a femur—macerated, illustrating the above. The smooth dead bone at the seat of fracture has been in process of separation. The rarefaction involved thereby has occurred mostly on the outer surface, but it is visible also on the medullary aspect. G. C. 1159. Presented by Professor James Russell. 6. 178. Septic Osteo-myelitis and Necrosis following- Amputation.—Portion of the shaft of a femur after amputa- tion—macerated, illustrating the above. The sawn end has necrosed, and has been in process of separation. Immediately above the necrosed piece an imper- fect collar of new periosteal bone has been formed, and the surface of the rest of the shaft shows the effects of rarefactive ostitis, combined with a limited amount of new periosteal bone growth.

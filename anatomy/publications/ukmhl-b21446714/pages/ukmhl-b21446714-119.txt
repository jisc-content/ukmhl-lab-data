Fractures of the Hiimcrus. 87 inches and a half. The upper fragment is tilted slightly forwards, and is rotated inwards. B. C. I. 1. M. 50. 3. 117. Badly united Fracture through the upper part of the Shaft.—Right humerus—macerated—showing the above. The upper fragment is rotated inwards, and is tilted forwards and outwards. The axis of the lower fragment has also been altered, so that the two pieces meet at an obtuse angle, directed outwards. They have united, but with considerable callous thickening between the broken ends. B. 0. L 1. M. 48. 3. 118. Badly United Comminuted Fracture through the Upper End.—Left humerus—macerated—showing the above. The upper portion has been split and comminuted, and of the fragments thus formed there are three main pieces, viz.— an anterior, bearing chiefly the bicipital groove; a posterior, bearing the head; and jambed between these two a smaller fragment on the inner side. The lower portion of the bone has a pointed upper extremity, and the appearances are such as might have been produced by the impaction of the lower portion into the upper, thus splitting and comminuting it. The bone has been in process of healing, but as the new bone is still porous, it has evidently not had time to consolidate. G. C. 2784. 3. 119. United Fracture above the Insertion of the Deltoid.—Anterior half of the upper end of a left humerus —macerated—showing the above. The broken ends of the bone have been displaced, so as to form with one another an obtuse angle, pointing forwards. There is very little thickening at the seat of fracture, and the medullary cavity has been restored. B. C. I. 1. M. 51a.

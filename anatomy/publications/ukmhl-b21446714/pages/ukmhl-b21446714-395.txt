Osteo-Sarcomata. 363 Presented by Geokoe Bell, F.R.C.S.E. surface of the tumour. This upper growth is beyond the tumour, and is almost certainly due to the irritation of its presence. It closely resembles the growth due to pus-forming organisms, and may be considered as " irritative." It may be seen near most specimens of periosteal sarcoma. This specimen is essentially similar to the last, except that there is less bone. 'W. C. G. 32. 6. 404. Osteo-Sarcoma of Femur and Knee-joint.—Lower end of a left femur—macerated, illustrating the above. There is an extensive formation of new bone round the lower end down to the articular surface, and filling up the inter- condyloid notch. The" bone is composed of delicate plates and processes, extending outwards from the surface of the shaft, and more or less closely packed together at different places. Above the new growth for some distance the surface of the bone is rarefied, and beyond that there is the crust of new periosteal bone noted in the previous specimen. G. C. 320. Presented by Dr Stenhouse and Professor W. R. Turner. 6. 405. Cystic Osteo-Sarcoma of Femur. — Sections of the anterior part of the lower end of a right femur — macerated, illustrating the above. The tumour occupied the whole of the thigh from the knee to the . nip-jomt, and was cystic in places. This specimen shows the characteristic development of delicate plates of bone running outwards from the surface with various degrees of obliquity. The disease does not seem to have reached the synovial cavity of the knee-joint. G. C. 314. b.

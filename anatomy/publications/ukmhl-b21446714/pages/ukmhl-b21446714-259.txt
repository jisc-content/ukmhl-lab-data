Bone affected by Neighbouring Congestion. 227 eiated with Chronic Ulcer of the Leg.—Lower three- fourths of a left tibia and fibula—macerated, to show the above. The patient, a middle-aged man, had suffered from ulcer of the leg for many years. Owing to the intractable character of the ulcer, the leg was amputated by Mr John Duncan. The development of bone here also takes the form chiefly of irregular processes, following the inter-muscular septa. On the tibia there is, however, a considerable development on that part which lay beneath the ulcer, especially upon the front and on the outer surface, while smaller irregular patches can be seen at other places, even down to the inner malleolus. On the fibula the bony outgrowths are more prominent, the greater part, however, being toward the lower end of the bone. As in the previous case, the bony outgrowths are by no means limited to the part which lay immediately beneath the ulcer. G. C. 3186. Presented by John Duncan, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 64. Chronic Ulcer of the Leg-, which caused the Bony Outgrowths in the foregroing- Specimen.—Cast—in glue and glycerine—after amputation of the leg from which the previous specimen was obtained. The cast shows an unhealthy ulcer of the callous type, which had considerable induration and fibrous matting round \L The position of the ulcer should be compared with the out- growths on the previous specimen.

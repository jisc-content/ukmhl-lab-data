Diseases of Joints. 454 The inner condyle is atrophied, and shows only a small patch of cartilaginous surface near the back. The outer condyle and the greater part of the trochlear surface are wanting,, and the exposed cancellous bone is irregular. This also has probably been a chronic case with anchylosis. B. C. ii. M. 31. 7. 73. Tubercular Arthritis, with great Loss of Bone, subsiding".—Lower end of a left femur—macerated, illus- trating the above. The front of the trochlear surface and of the outer condyle has disappeared, exposing the interior. The scanty remains of the outer condyle has circular tubercular erosions upon it, and the back of the inner condyle is altered in shape and porous on the surface. Apparently this has been an old-standing case in which there has been anchylosis of the joint, with much distortion. G. C. 753, 7. 74. Tubercular Arthritis, tending to cure—Sepsis.- Lower end of a right femur—macerated, illustrating the above. The trochlear surface and the outer condyle, except a small spur of it at the back, have disappeared, and the articular- surface of the inner condyle is scooped out and rarefied. The surface left where the bone has disappeared is rarefied, and shows numerous necrotic fragments in process of separation. There is also a scale of necrotic bone in process of separation, on the outer side of the shaft above the gap. The great loss of substance on the outer condyle has probably been from tuberculosis, but the necrotic appearances noted have almost certainly been due to septic inflammation. G. C. 375.

Arthritis Deformans of Elbow-joint. 505 Ulna.—Left elbow-joint, with the muscles cleaned off—in spirit, section removed from the inner side, illustrating the above. There has been firm anchylosis of the elbow. The lower end of the humerus is enlarged, and the ulna even more so, and the irregularities have interlocked. Fibrous tissue intervenes between the articular surfaces at most places. What was formerly the capitellum is now an irregular hollow on the outer side of the humerus, with a margin of new bone round it. The head of the radius is greatly enlarged, and has the appearance of having been shifted bodily outwards. Its articular surface, like that of the humerus, is smooth and eburnated, while round about it shows the usual irregularity. The broken ends of the ulna are surrounded by a capsule, and there is the cavity of a false joint between them. A quantity of fibrous tissue at the back unites the fragments to one another and to the adjacent part of the radius. q q 3069 Presented by William Kussell, M.D. 196. Arthritis Deformans of the Elbow with an Ununited Fracture of the Upper End of the Ulna.— Macerated section of the humerus and ulna from the fore- going specimen, showing the interlocking of the altered articular surfaces. G. C. 3069. Presented by William Russell, M.D. 197. Anchylosis after Old-standing- Arthritis De- formans.—Adjacent portions of a right humerus and ulna— macerated, illustrating the above. While the anchylosis is osseous and complete at the back, there is a furrow of separation on the front. The lower end of the humerus seems to have been partially absorbed, while the upper end of the ulna has become enlarged on the front and

328 Diseases of Bone, The leg was amputated. The fibula is for the most part covered with a nodular crust of new bone, the surface of which is rough, especially near the lower end. The tibia, several inches above its lower end, shows a similar crust, especially at the back, but towards the middle of the shaft the changes are comparatively slight. F. P. C. 449. Presented by John Campbell, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 328. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Bones of the Leg.— Left tibia and fibula—macerated, illustrating the above. The tibia has a periosteal crust over nearly the whole of its surface, especially towards the lower end, where the bone is manifestly thickened. The surface of the thickening is smooth on the inner aspect and rough on the outer. The fibula shows irregular periosteal deposits over the greater part of its surfaces. The bones are increased in weight. B. C. i. 5. M. 73. 6. 329. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Fibula—Portion of a fibula—macerated, illustrating the above. The shaft is thickened for about three inches by a fusiform node-like development of bone upon its surface. F. P. C. 459. 6. 330. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Fibula.-Right fibula —macerated, illustrating the above. The lower half of the bone is uniformly thickened all round, and its surface is rough and porous, with patches of rarefaction and erosion here and there. B. C. i. 5. M. 83. 6. 331. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Fibula.-Sb.aft of a left fibula—macerated, illustrating the above.

423 Abnormal Thickness of Sktdl. 6. 545. Great Irregularity in the Thickness of the Skull. —Skull-cap—macerated and trefined, illustrating the above. The specimen is very irregular in thickness, the irregu- larity being especially noticeable on the inner aspect. "Near the longitudinal sinus there are several deep depressions resem- bling those produced by Paccionian bodies. On each side, a little behind the coronal suture, there is an elevation, due partly to thickening and partly to depression on the outer aspect. There is a small exostosis on the inside of the frontal bone near the front. B. C. i. 2. M. 49. 6. 546. Abnormally thin Skull-cap.—Skull-cap—macerated, illustrating the above. The whole bone is remarkably thin. The digital impres- sions are well marked, especially on the inside of the frontal and lower part of the parietal bones. On the outer surface near the junction of the sagittal and coronal sutures there are two elongated areas where the surface is remarkably porous. B. C. i. 3. M. 44. 6.547. Deep Depression over the Sagittal Suture,— Skull-cap—macerated, illustrating the above. The coronal and sagittal sutures are nearly obliterated, but a sulcus marks their position. This sulcus, which is deep on the sides of the coronal suture, is remarkably so at the vertex, where the bone is reduced to a thin shell, and is perforated at one spot. The bone is also thin, and transmits light in several other places, especially near the parietal eminences, and at the junction of the coronal and sagittal sutures. B. C. I. 3. M. 42.

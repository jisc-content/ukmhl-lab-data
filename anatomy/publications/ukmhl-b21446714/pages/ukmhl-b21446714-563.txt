531 'Tubercular Disease of the Spine. The bodies from the third to the eighth vertebrae have been affected. The inter-vertebral foramina just at the bend have been obliterated by the pressure of debris into them. The laminae of the affected vertebrae are ossified together, and the fourth and fifth spinous processes and laminae are greatly atrophied. The coincidence of the blocking of the inter-vertebral foramina with the atrophy of the spinous process should be noted in connection with No. 7. 238; but whether there is any relation between them, as cause and effect is uncertain. W. C. H. 53. 248. Tubercular Disease in Process of Cure.—Eight half of the spinal column, thorax, and pelvis of a child—macerated, illustrating the above. There is an acute curvature in the lower dorsal region, and the lower six vertebrae are fused into a common wedge-shaped mass, with its apex projecting backwards. There are cavities in its interior. The spinous processes at the angle are somewhat atrophied, and thus the apparent acuteness of the curve is diminished. B. C. i. 3. M. 10. 249. Tubercular Disease cured by Anchylosis.—Spinal column, thorax, and pelvis of a young person—macerated, illustrating the above. " This is a fine example of the curve, which is the consequence of caries and anchylosis. The oesophagus reached directly from the neck to the diaphragm, so that it was not more than three inches in length, while the aorta measured between the same points nearly nine inches." The bodies of the vertebrae from the seventh dorsal to the second lumbar inclusive have been greatly absorbed, and their remains fused into a common mass, in which the seventh dorsal vertebra above touches the second lumbar below. The spinous processes at the projecting angle are somewhat absorbed. The upper portion of the dorsal spine has a compensating

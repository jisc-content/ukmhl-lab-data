Diseases of Joints. 512 7. 212. Lateral Curvature, with Anchylosis.—Cervical and dorsal vertebrae, with the ribs attached—macerated, illustrat- ing the above. The patient died of consumption. The spine, as a whole, is bent forward. There is a lateral curve to the left, in the upper dorsal region, having its maxi- mum about the fourth dorsal vertebra; and one slightly to the right in the lower dorsal region. The upper ribs on the left or convex side are raised and opened out, the angles projecting backwards, while those on the concave or right side are com- pressed, and the angles flattened. The bodies of the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth dorsal vertebras are fused together, and some anchylosis has occurred between the eighth, ninth, and tenth dorsal vertebra?. B. C. I. 3. M. 20. 7.213. Old-standing- Lateral Curvature.—Last cervical, dorsal, and two upper lumbar vertebra, with the ribs attached— partially dissected and dried, showing alternating lateral curves. A curve to the left in the upper dorsal region has its maximum about the third vertebra, and one to the right in the lower dorsal region has its maximum about the tenth vertebra. Apparently there has been another curve to the left in the lumbar region. There is a slight rotation of the vertebras towards the convexity, with corresponding changes in the ribs, as noted in the previous specimens. The first rib is not as much elevated as might have been expected. This may have been due to faulty mounting. B. C. 1. 3. M. 15. 7. 214. Advanced Lateral Curvature.—Cervical, dorsal, and lumbar regions of a spine, Avith portions of ribs attached— macerated, illustrating the above. From an adult who died of disease of the lungs. There is an alternating series of lateral curves. The principal curve is in the lower dorsal region. Its convexity

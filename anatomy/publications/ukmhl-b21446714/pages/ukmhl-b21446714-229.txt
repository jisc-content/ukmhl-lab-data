Dislocations of the Lower Limb. 197 DISLOCATION OF THE KNEE. 5.18. Partial Outward Dislocation of the Knee.—Plaster cast of a right knee, showing the above. The skin was drawn very tightly over the inner condyle, and would have sloughed had reduction not been effected. The tibia and fibula have been displaced outwards and backwards. G. C. 3112. Presented by Alexis Thomson, F.R.C.S.E. 5.19. Compound Dislocation of the Knee.—Plaster cast of a right knee, showing the above. The ligament was torn, and the skin on the inner side ruptured so as to expose the interior of the knee-joint. The tibia and fibula have been displaced inwards and backwards. 5.20. Partial Outward Dislocation of the Tibia and Fibula.—Glue and glycerine cast of a left knee, showing the above. Four years before, the patient, a young man, then aged 20, had struck his knee in trying to jump into a cart. Several ineffectual attempts had been made to reduce the deformity. The joint subsequently became aflected with tubercular disease, and shortly after the cast was taken the joint was successfully excised by Mr A. G. Culter. (See Series 7.) The cast shows a slight outward dislocation of the tibia, but the relation of the parts was masked by swelling of the synovial membrane. q. q 2891 Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E.

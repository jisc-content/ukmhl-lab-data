143 Fractures of the Tibia and Fibula. This fracture has probably been compound. Some of the bone at the fractured spot has necrosed, and has been in process of separation. The bone near has been stimulated, and shows a crust of new periosteal bone. F. p. c. 2955 Presented by Professor John Thomson. 3. 277. Compound Fracture of the Tibia and Fibula.— Upper three-fourths of a left tibia and fibula, with a small portion of the outer malleolus—macerated, to show the above. Newly formed cancellous bone fills the lower broken end of the tibia, and periosteal bone has been formed on both bones near the seat of fracture, while the rest of their surfaces shows opening out of the pores for blood-vessels.

Badly united Fracture of the Tibia and Fibula, about the Middle.-Plaster cast of a right tibia and fibula' showing the above. The bones are united at an angle directed forwards, and are thickened in their whole extent, but especially at the seat °f fracture- G. C. 3331. From a Specimen in the Barclay Collection by James Biohabdson. 3. 279. Badly united Fracture of both Bones-Portion of a right tibia and fibula-macerated, showing the above. The fractured bones are united in a common mass. The lower fragment of the fibula is greatly thickened and runs into the upper end of the tibia. With the exception of the upper part of the fibula, the bones are greatly thickened and irregular on the surface, and a shelf of bone on the upper end of the

Syphilitic Enlargement. 325 6.316. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia.—Left tibia— macerated, illustrating the above. The anterior and lateral parts of the bone are diffusely thick- ened, except near the upper and lower ends. There are also one or two thickenings on the posterior surface. The surface of the main thickening is rough and porous, except over an area on the inner side, about five inches from the lower end, where it is smooth. B. C. i. 5. M. 74. 6. 317. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia.—Left tibia- macerated, illustrating the above. There is one periosteal node on the outer and inner surfaces about the middle and another smaller one on the posterior surface higher up. The surfaces of the nodes are smooth as if the active process had long ceased. The inner surface at the lower end shows marks of increased vascularity, and the bone as a whole is increased in weight. B. C. i. 5. M. 68. 6. 318. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia.—Eight tibia of a strong man—macerated, illustrating the above. This specimen was from the same skeleton as No. 6. 293,-which see. There are nodes on the posterior surface, and a smaller one on the crest, as well as a periosteal crust on the shin. . There are several marks of pick and spade on the bone, which were produced when it was being dug up. G. C. 3276. Presented by W. K. Martine, M.B., CM. 6. 319. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia.—Left tibia from the same skeleton as the last—macerated, illustrating the .above.

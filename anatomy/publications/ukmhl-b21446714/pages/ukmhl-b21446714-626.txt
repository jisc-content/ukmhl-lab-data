594 The Limls as a Whole. The posterior tibial vein at its upper part seems to have been thrombosed during life. The anterior tibial artery is somewhat contracted; its coat thickened, and contains a few calcareous particles. In the interior there was a loose clot in many places. The discoloured gangrenous portion is separated from the rest of the leg by a line of demarcation. The tissues in the gangrenous part are soft and oily from degeneration, while those in the upper part are dry and free from oil and fat. This seems to have been a case of embolus of the artery rather than of thrombosis. Gr. C. 3147. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.K.C.S.E., 1890. 11. 73. Moist Senile Gangrene of Foot — Separated.— Gangrenous foot of an adult—in spirit, illustrating the above. The sloughy condition of the specimen is well shown. It is still discoloured, although much of the colour must have been bleached by the spirit. The foot has separated at the ankle joint. G- C- 2712> Presented by William Newbigging, F.R.C.S.E. 11. 74. Moist Senile Gangrene of Hand and Forearm.—Left hand and forearm—in spirit, partially dissected to illustrate the above. The patient, a woman aged 79 years, was an inmate of a workhouse. The medical attendant's report was as follows :— "She had fatty degeneration of the heart's muscle, and extensive atheromatous disease of blood-vessels, and occasionally had fits of an epileptic character, due, I think, to localised brain softening. Her last illness dated from July 23rd, when she fell over the bed while asleep, and sustained an injury to the left arm. The trouble began in the fingers, and spread gradually to the hand and arm, assuming all the appearances of moist gangrene. She was comatose two or three days before death, which took place on 13th August 1888." The arm was decomposing and putrid during life. The tissues in the gangrenous part are oily and soft from decomposition.

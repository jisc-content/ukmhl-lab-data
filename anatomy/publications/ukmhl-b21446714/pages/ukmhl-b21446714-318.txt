Diseases of Bone. 286 6. 221. Tubercular Necrosis and Enlargement of the There has been advanced tubercular disease of the articular surfaces. The position previously occupied by articular cartilage is opened out and deeply excavated at three places. On the inner articular surface, near the back, there is a piece of necrotic bone in process of separation, and with part of its surface smooth. Round the head of the tibia some new periosteal bone has been thrown out, probably from sepsis. F. P. C. 767. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 6. 219. Tubercular Disease of the Clavicle.—Eight clavicle —macerated, illustrating the above. The bone is very irregular. Portions have been eaten out as if by the burrowing of tubercular granulations, or after the separation of sequestra, and numerous bridges have been left, connecting outstanding spicules with the rest of the bone. The sternal end is the part most affected; the outer end is scarcely changed. Comparatively little new bone has been formed. G. C. 3396. 6. 220. Tubercular Necrosis and Enlargement of the First Metacarpal Bone.—Metacarpal bone of a thumb- macerated, illustrating the above. A shell of new periosteal bone, with numerous cloacal apertures, has formed round the remains of the original shaft. These remains can be seen through the apertures, with the tissue partially opened out, and for the most part absorbed. Described and figured in Mr Benjamin Bell's work on the Bones, plate i. fig. 7.

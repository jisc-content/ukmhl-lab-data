123 Fractures of the Femur. This . . . demonstrates that splinters in fracture are sometimes broken off, and again adhere even to other surfaces than those from which they were broken, and that splinters do not necessarily lose their principle of life." W. C. G. 4. 3. 217. United Fracture of the Shaft.—Lower portion of the shaft of a femur—macerated. A section is removed from the fractured portion, to more clearly illustrate the mode of union. The section shows that the ends of the medullary cavity have been closed by a thin plate of bone, and that the interval between the broken ends is occupied by cancellous tissue, which has a thin, compact plate on the outside continuous with the adjacent surfaces of each fragment of the shaft. The upper fragment over-rides in front of the lower, and is set at an angle to it. B. C i. 1. M. 32. c. 3. 218. Somewhat recent Compound Fracture of the Shaft. —Portion of the shaft of a femur—muscles removed, to illus- trate the above—in spirit. From a patient 65 years 'of age, in the Royal Infirmary, who received a compound fracture near the middle of the bone. Several of his ribs were also broken, and he suffered considerably from inflammation of his lungs. He was affected with jaundice, and erysipelas of the injured leg came on five days after the injury. Extensive abscesses took place, his pulse intermitted, his limbs became cedematous, diarrhoea came on, and he died six weeks after the injury. The broken extremities of the bone seem to be dead, but have not had time to become loose. There has been no attempt at union. G q 2225. Presented by Alexander Watson, Esq., 1839. 3.219. Comparatively recent Compound Fracture of the Shaft.—Lower end of a left femur—macerated, showing the changes dependent upon the above.

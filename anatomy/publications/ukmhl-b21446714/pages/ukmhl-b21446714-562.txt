Diseases of Joints. 530 7.244. Tubercular Disease, with Destruction of the Bodies. Right half of the previous specimen, similarly prepared. The piece of hone representing the fused spines is well Shown. <*. C 3244. Presented by Johnson Symington, F.R.C.S.E., 1891. c. Specimens illustrating spontaneous cure, more or less complete. 7. 245. Tubercular Disease, partially cured by Anchylosis. Four lower dorsal and two upper lumhar vertebrae—macerated, illustrating the above. The spine is bent forward, and the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth dorsal bodies are anchylosed into a common mass. This mass has been in turn attacked, and its surface shows large rounded depressions and excavations. The body of the first lumbar vertebra, and slightly also that of the second, is similarly eroded. The articular processes are all more or less anchylosed. B. 0. i. 3. M. 53. 7. 246. Tubercular Disease, partially cured by Anchylosis.— Last cervical, dorsal, and upper three lumbar vertebra- macerated. " A great abscess covered these bones, and the patient died of hectic as it appeared." " Some of the vertebras are united together by bone, a small part of the third vertebra remains, the sixth and seventh are much destroyed, the ninth and tenth also, and the heads of the ribs have partaken of the disease, some of them being carious, others united together." The spine is uniformly bent forward. A bridge of bone unites partially the eleventh and twelfth dorsal, also the twelfth dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae. The anchylosis represents an attempt at cure. B. C. I. 3. M. 51. 7. 247. Tubercular Disease in Process of Cure.—Upper dorsal vertebrse—macerated, illustrating the above.

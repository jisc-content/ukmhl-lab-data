Injuries of Bone. 128 3. 231. (Contd.)—Upper end of a right femur—macerated—with section through the seat of fracture, to show the above. The upper fragment has been tilted forwards, and over- rides the lower one. A longitudinal splinter seems to have been broken from the inner side of the shaft. The medullary cavity has been closed in by bone, and the broken ends have been united by bone, which in some places is extremely dense. W. C. G. 7. 3. 232. United Fracture about the Middle of the Shaft. Left femur—macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment over-laps behind the lower one, which is rotated outwards. The broken ends of the bone have been united by a dense callus, and the exposed medullary cavity has been closed in in each fragment. It should be noted that in fractures at this level the upper fragment is usually displaced in front of, not behind, the lower one. B. C. i. 1. M. 30. 3. 233. United Fracture at the Middle.-Left femur- macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment over-rides in front of the lower, and both are tilted outwards. There is considerable callus between the broken ends. The closing of the medullary cavity of the broken ends, and the smoothing over of the strong intervening callus are similar to that seen in previous specimens. B. C. i. 1. M. 33. c. 3. 234. United Fracture about the Middle of the Shaft. —Ricrht femur—macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment is tilted forwards and over-rides m front of the lower. The medullary cavity is closed in, and the callus between the fractured ends is just sufficient to unite them.

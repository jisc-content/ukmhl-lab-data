Diseases of Joints. 528 The cause of the absorption of the lamina? is still obscure. A possible clue may be found in the pressure which must have been present at one time upon the intervertebral nerves. The portion examined by Dr. Woodhead was found to show no sign of tubercular disease. G. C. 3105. Presented by A. G. Millek, F.R.C.S.E., 1889. 7. 240. Tuberculosis, with Atrophy of Ribs and Spines, and Paraplegia.—Left half of the previous specimen—in spirit, illustrating the above. Atrophy of the vertebral ends of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs is well shown. The pleura is greatly thickened and adherent, and the remains of the cavity similar to that on the other side is seen. G. C. 3106. Presented by A. G. Millee, F.R.C.S.E., 1889. 7. 241. Tubercular Disease, with Destruction of Bodies.— Lower cervical, dorsal, and lumbar portion of the spine of a child, with ribs attached—partly macerated, illustrating the above. There has been extensive destruction of the bodies of the last two dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae. The front of the vertebra? that remain from the fourth dorsal to the second lumbar inclusive have evidently been bared of periosteum and ligament, and their surfaces are rarefied and eroded. The spine is acutely bent where the vertebrae have been destroyed, so that the body of the eleventh dorsal touches that of the first lumbar. B. C. r. 3. M. 60. 7.242. Tubercular Disease, with Destruction of the Bodies.—Lumbar vertebrae of a child—in spirit, illustrating the above. "From a child affected with lumbar abscess, which projected, and was evacuated at the groin."

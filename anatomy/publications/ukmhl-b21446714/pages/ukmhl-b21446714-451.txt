Hydrocephalic Skulls. 419 halves of the frontal bones. The ossification of the frontal bones is very imperfect; numerous patches of membrane show themselves in the course of the bone. The spinal canal, from the fourth Dorsal Vertebra down- wards to the upper part of the sacrum, is quite open, corres- ponding to a condition of extensive spina bifida. B. C. v. 1. M. 20. 6. 532. Chronic Hydrocephalus.—Skull-cap of a boy, aged 5 years, cleaned, dried, and varnished, illustrating the above. The sagittal suture and a large area at the position of the anterior fontanelle are occupied by membrane. The lower extremities of the coronal suture are close together, but are occupied by membrane. The lower part of the frontal suture is united by bone. G. C. 3063. Presented by Betan C. Wallee, M.D. 6. 533.

From The Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, vol. xxxviii., 1832. Account of a case of Chronic Hydrocephalus, by David Craigic, M.D., page 41.

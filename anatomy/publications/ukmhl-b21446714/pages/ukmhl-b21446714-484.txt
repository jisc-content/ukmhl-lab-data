452 Diseases of Joints. Pus and lymph in the cavity of the joint, Semi-lunar cartilages and' articular cartilages of the femur and patella eroded, with caries of the- bones." The trochlear surface of the femur is bare, while the surface of the condyles is covered with granulations blanched and shrivelled by the spirit. An aperture in the inner tuber- osity of the tibia (indicated by a rod) passes downwards and forwards from the joint. G. C. 1485. Presented by John Campbell, F.R.C.S.E., 1832. 7. 68. Tubercular Arthritis beginning- in the Epiphysis of the Femur.—Lower epiphysis of a right femur, with upper end of the tibia and fibula, and the patella—macerated, to illustrate the above. The femoral epiphysis is excavated and eroded chiefly upon the articular surface of the inner condyle, but partly also- upon that of the outer condyle. The cartilage has been under- mined, as if tubercular foci in the epiphysis had gradually extended themselves into the bone as well as towards the joint.. The cartilage upon the outer tuberosity of the tibia, and upon the back of the inner one, is not much affected, but some absorption of the cartilage has occurred on the front of the inner tuberosity, possibly by extension from the femur. The articular surface of the patella has been superficially eroded. G. C. 1250. c. Where there are indications, more or less obvious, of a tendency to cure. 7. 69. Tubercular Arthritis subsiding.—Bones of a left knee- joint—macerated, showing great atrophy of the shafts and alteration of the articular surfaces. The epiphyseal end of the shaft of femur is reduced to a light shell. The epiphysis which has been detached is lightened, but to a less extent. The articular surfaces of both bones are rarefied in many places, while the cartilage has remained at others. The tibia is very

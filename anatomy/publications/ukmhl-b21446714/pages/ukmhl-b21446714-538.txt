Diseases of Joints. 506 Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E. outer side, where a piece of new bone occupies the position usually taken up by the head of the radius. There is an irregular facet upon this piece of new bone which extends on to the humerus, and must have been for articulation with the radius. Lower down on the ulna is seen a small hollow facet, which has evidently also been for the radius at the tubercle. Judging from the position of the anterior ridge of the ulna, the bones of the forearm have been fixed in pronation. The alternatives in deciding as to the nature of this con- dition lay between the above and a congenital malformation which indeed it in many ways resembles. B. C. 2. M. 51. JOINTS OF THE HAND. 7. 198. Arthritis Deformans affecting- Inter-phalangeal Joints.—Plaster cast of a right hand, illustrating the above. There is comparatively little change in the thumb, but there is distinct enlargement at the inter-phalangeal joints of the fingers, especially between the last two phalanges of the middle and ring fingers, which are crooked as well.

Rheumatic Changes in the Metacarpophalangeal Joints.—Cast in glue and glycerine of the back of the right hand of a young woman—illustrating the above. She had suffered from several attacks of acute rheumatism, leaving alterations in several joints, of which this hand was perhaps the worst. There is enlargement at all the metacarpophalangeal joints, and the fingers are flexed to the ulnar side, the thumb being bent acutely forward. G. C. 2899.

Arthritis Deformans of Knee-joint, 487 nation. The greater part of the cartilage on the patella is in the pile-of-velvet condition. G. C. 3157. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 7.159. Early Stage of Arthritis Deformans.—Eight knee- joint of an adult, laid open from the front by turning down the patella. The specimen is in spirit, showing changes in the synovial membrane and cartilage. The patient was a healthy man of 50, whose leg was amputated on account of a bad railway smash. His only symptom of trouble in the knee had been occasional stiffness. There is a fibrous shreddy condition, and a wearing away of the cartilaginous surfaces of the trochlea, and similar but less advanced changes on the patella. There is also a slight overgrowth of bone at the articular margin of the trochlear surface. The synovial membrane round the patella is markedly fringed. G. C. 2884. 7, 160. Early Stage of Arthritis Deformans.—Lower end of a right femur and patella—in spirit, showing changes in the cartilage. The patient was aged about 50, and his leg was amputated above the knee for a railway smash. As in the previous case, he had had occasional slight stiffness in the knee, to which, however, he had paid no attention. At the time of the accident he was not aware that there was anything the matter with the joint. The cartilaginous surface of the patella is irregular, especi- ally at its lower part. There is also some roughening and wearing down of cartilage on the trochlear surface of the femur, while along the articular margin of the inner condyle a narrow band of cartilage has disappeared. Bound the patella the synovial membrane is slightly fringed. G. C. 3129. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E.

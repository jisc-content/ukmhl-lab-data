181 Gunshot Fractures of the Tibia. Presented by Surgeon-General Billings, U.S.A. tures is greatly comminuted, especially at the back and outer side, but there is comparatively little splitting upwards, and none down-wards beyond the fragments. The fibula is broken a little above the point where the bullet struck the tibia, and may have been secondary to the fracture of the tibia. Some new periosteal bone has formed at and near the injured places. The bullet evidently struck the tibia from the outer side, and carried away bone before it on the inside. Gr. C. 3431. Presented by Surgeon-General Billings, U.S.A. 3. 388. Gunshot Fracture of the Lower End of the Tibia. —Lower end of a left tibia and fibula—macerated, with the fragments wired together. There is an irregular aperture in front of the tibia two inches above the articular surface. The margins are bevelled towards the inside. At the back of the bone opposite there is another aperture, somewhat smaller and more irregular than that in front, with its margins bevelled externally. The inner malleolus and half of the articular surface is split off from the rest of the bone, and the fissures extend upwards into the shaft for some inches above the seat of injury. The bullet has evidently struck the leg from the front and outer side, and has passed backwards and slightly downwards. G. C. 3432. Presented by Surgeon-General Billings, U.S.A. 3.389. Gunshot Fracture of the Bones forming the Ankle-Joint.—Lower ends of a right tibia and fibula, with the astragalus and os calcis-macerated, showing the effects of gunshot injury at the back of the ankle. The outer malleolus has been carried entirely away, and the adjacent parts of the astragalus and tibia are ploughed up. The ball has apparently passed obliquely from before back- Wards- G. C. 3433.

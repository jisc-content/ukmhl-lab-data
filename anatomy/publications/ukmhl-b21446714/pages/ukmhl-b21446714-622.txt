590 The Limbs as a Whole. OUS Separation.—Lower portion of a left leg and foot—in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient was a very stout old woman, aged 78. She had shown premonitory symptoms in both legs, i.e. cramps, pain and coldness, which were thought, at first, to be due to gout. The gangrene began in the great toe, and gradually spread up the leg until it came just below the head of the fibula, where a line of demarcation was found. Amputation was not performed owing to the patient having advanced heart and kidney disease. The dead soft tissues were therefore cut through just below the line of demarcation, and an ineffectual attempt was made to destroy the bone by nitric and hydro-chloric acids. However, a month afterwards, the leg separated spontaneously. The stump healed over after a small fragment of dead bone had separated, and she went about on crutches and died 18 months afterwards of apoplexy. The soft parts are shrivelled and discoloured. The upper ends of the bones are irregular and rough, owing to the natural mode of separation by granulations. G. C. 3167. Presented by Dickinson Leigh, M.D., 1890. 11. 65. Dry Senile Gangrene of Leg and Foot.—Lower portion of a left leg and foot—dried, illustrating the above. The soft parts separated spontaneously, but the bones were sawn through. The patient recovered. The specimen has the characteristic black and shrivelled appearance. The bones have been sawn across. Presented by Professor J. W. Tubner. 11. 66. Dry Senile Gangrene of Foot.—Greater part of a right foot—dried, illustrating the above. The separation has evidently taken place through the tarsus. The specimen has the characteristic black and shrivelled appearance. F. P. C. 1207. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 11. 67.

450 Diseases of Joints. Synovitis.—Patella, showing, along with considerable rarefac- tion of the articular surface, some new bone formation on the anterior surface. G. C. 1175. Presented by Professor James Russell. 7. 62. Invasion of Articular Surfaces from Tubercular Synovitis.—Patella, showing rarefaction of the articular surface, with some development of new bone on the anterior surface and lightening of the original bone texture. G. C. 1175. Presented by Professor James Russell. 7.63. Tubercular Synovitis with Abscess.—Plaster cast illustrating the above. The cast shows a general globular swelling of the joint, with a projection at one spot which must have been due to an abscess. The adjacent parts of the limb have been atrophied. P. P. C. 2889. b. Changes primarily in bone, or apparently so. 7. 64. Tubercular Arthritis beginning" in the Femur.— Sections of the knee-joint of a child—injected and in spirit. One-half has had a slice removed from the front, to display more completely the interior of the epiphyses, and the articular ends of the other half have been wrenched apart. The interior of the joint has been occupied by pus and curdy matter, and the cartilaginous surfaces have been irregu- larly eroded. Caseous centres may be seen on the cross section of the lower epiphysis of the femur. The epiphysis of the tibia is apparently intact. This appears to have been a case where the disease has begun in the bone, for the synovial membrane has not been much affected. G- C- 3192- Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E.

Atrophy of Bone. 203 6- 12, Atrophy of the Tibia and Fibula, following- Anchylosis of the Knee-joint from Disease.—Left tihia and fibula and lower end of corresponding femur and patella—macerated, to show the above. A portion has been removed from the head of the tibia to show the condition of the cancellous tissue. The bones are very greasy, and were made only tolerably clean after having been several times boiled in soda solution. The patient had suffered from knee-joint disease, and many years before amputation the limb had become anchylosed in a flexed position. It was removed because it was in the way. The shafts of both bones are diminished in size, and are bent slightly backwards. The compact tissue, however, is strong, and the bones are apparently not lightened in proportion to their diminished size. The section through the cancellous tissue shows it to be stronger and firmer in the epiphyses than in the upper part of the shaft. The patella has been anchylosed by bone to the femur. The articular surfaces of the femur and tibia are irregular, but without any sign of existing active disease. The changes in these bones may be attributed partly to disuse and partly to other results of the previous knee-joint disease. Q q 3554 Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 13. Atrophy of the Bones of the Foot from Disuse.— Section of the bones of a right foot—macerated, to show the above. The patient had been unable to walk properly for some years, owin^ to the gradual enlargement of a central sarcoma of the fibula, for which the leg was eventually amputated. The texture of the bones is light and greasy. G. C. 3235. Presented by P. H. Watson, F.E.C.S.E. '6. 14. Atrophy of the Bones of Leg- and Foot from Disuse,

He was attacked with symptoms which were attributed for a time to the formation of matter under the skull, hut which might he more correctly attributed to typhus fever, since after death no signs of affection of the brain could be discovered'* (Sir Charles Bell). The surface of the greater part of the frontal bone is roughened by the opening out of vascular pores, and the smooth dead portion of bone is surrounded by a groove formed by granulation tissue. There are two slight fissures in the frontal bone, one near the necrosed piece, and another at a corresponding place on the other side, but these may have been made in removing the calvarium. B.

The dead piece is smooth and polished. The granulations have begun to cut a groove round it, and the adjacent bone is roughened bY inflammation. The trephine has been applied. G. C. 1165.

Part of the bone is in process of separation. The trephine has been twice applied. The cause of death has probably been septicaemia or pyssmia. Presented by Professor James Russell. 3. 43. Compound Fracture of the Skull-Septic Osteo- myelitiS-Death.-Portion of the right frontal and parietal bones—macerated-from a case of compound fracture. There has been extensive ulceration and necrosis, and

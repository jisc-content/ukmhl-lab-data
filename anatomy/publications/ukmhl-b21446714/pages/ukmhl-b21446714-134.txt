102 Injuries of Bone. humerus—macerated, showing expansion of bone near the lower end. Some years before the preparation was obtained the bone had been fractured by gunshot. The hone is expanded, and the cavity, ahout three inches from the lower end, is smooth, probahly the result of a slowly forming abscess. B- C- xvn- 28, 3. 163. Shattering- of the Hand from the Explosion of a Gun.—Skeleton of the left hand and lower part of the fore-arm of a young man—macerated, showing the above. In consequence of the bursting of a fowling-piece, his hand was shattered, and a primary amputation through the fore-arm was performed. From this the patient made a good recovery. The first phalanx of the thumb has been injured; the last and part of the second phalanx of the third finger, as well as the whole of the little finger, except the base of its metacarpal bone, have been lost (perhaps blown away). Every carpal bone except the trapezium and semi-lunar has been fractured. G. C. 917. Presented by Sir Geoege Ballingall. 3. 164. Shattering of the Hand from the Explosion of a Gun.—Lower ends of a left radius and ulna, with remains of carpus and metacarpus, showing the above. The subject, William Gardner, aged 19, received the injury by the bursting of a fowling-piece on 8th May 1828. The metacarpal bones of the left hand were fractured near their carpal extremities; their heads, with the exception of that of the thumb, were dislocated at their articulation with the bones of the carpus, the anterior row of which was very much exposed and loosened from its connections with the other; the soft parts on the back, but particularly on the palm of the hand, were extensively lacerated; haemorrhage trifling.

Syphilitic Affections of the Skeleton. 315 is a slight deposit of periosteal bone, just above the front of the lower articular surfaces. The bones of the hand show no definite change. The pelvis shows no characteristic change. On both sides the vascular channels seem unusually well marked, and on the right side, the outer surface of the ilium is slightly roughened by periosteal formation. The right femur is thickened from the lower end up to about the middle, but more behind than in front. The surface of the thickening has all the appearance of new periosteal formation, and is more irregular on the back than in front. One vascular channel on the back is enlarged into a distinct aperture. The shaft of the left femur is thickened about the middle, mostly on the inner side, but also slightly all round. A periosteal crust can be traced downwards to the knee-joint, especially on the inner side. On both tibia? the vascular pores are enlarged, and some new bone has been formed on the shin surface and at the attachment of the tibialis anticus muscle. Both fibulae show slight periosteal rough- ness at the muscular attachments, and an enlargement of vascular pores. The bones of the foot show no appreciable change- G. C. 3391. 6. 283. Syphilitic Disease of the Clavicle.â€”A left clavicle- macerated, illustrating the above. The greater part of the bone has been affected. About the middle the anterior and upper parts have been attacked, and an excavation has been formed, in the base of which are fragments of necrotic-looking bone partially separated. This excavation is surrounded by new periosteal bone, which passes round to the under surface, and fades off at either side. The outer end of the bone is irregular and partially absorbed, and near it new periosteal bone has been formed. G. C. 993. 6.284.

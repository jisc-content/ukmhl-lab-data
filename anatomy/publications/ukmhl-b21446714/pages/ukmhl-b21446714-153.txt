121 Fractures of the Femur. 3. 211. Recent Fracture at the Lower End of the Shaft.— Lower end of a right femur—macerated, showing the above. The line of fracture is irregularly transverse, and there has been some comminution at the inner side. The periosteum indicates some previous inflammation. The compact tissue of the shaft is extremely dense, and is increased in thickness at the expense of the medullary cavity. The weight of the bone is abnormally great. G. C. 762. MODE OF UNION IN FEACTUEES OF THE SHAFT. 3.212. Recent Oblique Fracture of the Shaft in a previously Diseased Femur.—Right femur — macerated, showing the above. The fracture has occurred at the junction of the middle and lower thirds, and is somewhat spirally oblique from behind downwards and forwards. The edges are sharp, as if sufficient time had not elapsed for union. The whole shaft is irregularly thickened, as by syphilitic nodes, and the lower articular surface has been altered in a manner similar to that seen in tubercular disease with spontaneous cure. Remark—"When the thigh-bone is fractured by a person dropping from a height it is in general fractured obliquely, as in the present instance ; and the extremities of the bones are thrust past each other, both in consequence of the direction of the force, and from the points penetrating easily into the flesh." (Sir Charles Bell's M.S. Catalogue.) B. 0.1.1. M. 10. .213. Comparatively Recent Oblique Fracture of the Shaft.—Section of the shaft of a femur, near the lower end injected and in spirit. " The young man was seized with erysipelas, which carried him off. This affords us an opportunity of observing the progress of re-union." The interval between the broken ends of the bone is occupied by soft material, an early stage of fibrous tissue, which would have eventually developed into bone. B. C. i. 1. M. 42.

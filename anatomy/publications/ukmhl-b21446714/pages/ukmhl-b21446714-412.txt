380 Diseases of Bone. some to be cancerous, by others to be scrofulous. I suspect the latter, as it wants those hard membranous septa so char- acteristic of schirrhus. When the fleshy parts are removed by putrefaction, the bone of this tumour puts on the same appear- ance as is seen in G. 38," i.e. 6.401. W. C. G. 43. 6. 440. SaPCOma Of Rib.—Portions of the fifth, sixth, and seventh right ribs, with a small portion of lung and liver—in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient, aged 44, was a strong and healthy man, though rather addicted to alcohol. There had been no injury^ so far as was known, and no instance of malignant disease in the family history. The tumour grew first on the sixth rib, and when first noticed was about the size of a small bean. He consulted Dr Craig, who became suspicious of malignancy, from the fact of the man's losing flesh rapidly, without any other apparent cause. In six months after Dr Craig was first called, the man died.

Secondary deposits occurred throughout the liver, and the lungs also showed traces of being affected. (See the ' 'Edinburgh Medical Journal," February 1885, p. 735.) The muscles lying over the primary tumour have been partly pushed aside, and there is an appearance of a capsule. This, it should be noted, is often misleading, and should not in practice be allowed to contra-indicate malignancy. G. C. 2716. Presented by W. Craig, F.R.C.S.E. 6 441.

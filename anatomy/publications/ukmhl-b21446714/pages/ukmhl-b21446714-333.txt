Syphilitic Necrosis. 301 for the most part, replaced by dense bone. This was formerly described as "mercurial caries, with commencing exfoliation of the outer portion of the skull." p p q 31g Presented by Professor John Thomson. 6. 257. Syphilitic Disease of the jSkull, with Neerosis.- Portion of the vault of a skull-macerated, illustrating the above. A large necrosed fragment in process of separation. The outside shows the disease less advanced on the right of the middle line. The roughness is in various stages from opened- out vascular channels to irregular erosions, and one of these is at one place nearly healed over. On the left side, a lar^e fragment, whose surface is for the most part destroyed, has bee°n partially separated, and a groove has been formed round it From the inside it can be seen that the necrosis, except over a united area, had not been complete all through, the deeper- layers of the bone having furnished granulations for the process of separation. The general inner surface shows marks of increased vascularity. The bone, except at the necrosed part has been thickened and condensed. W c G ^ 6. 258. Syphilitic (?)

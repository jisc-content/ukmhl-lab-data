341 Cartilaginous Tumours. acromion and coracoicl processes of the scapula and part of the clavicle. The patient made an excellent recovery. The tumour weighed twelve pounds. It was macerated, but all the parts fell to pieces. This has probably been a case like the previous one, and the nodular character of the cast still further confirms this view. G. C. 1789. Presented by James Syme, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 359. Chondroma of the Humerus.—Photograph of Mr Syme's illustration of the patient from whom the above tumour was removed. G. C. 3400. 6. 360. Chondroma (?) of the Humerus.—Plaster cast of a large tumour, apparently of the upper end of a left humerus, to illustrate the above. Prom its nodular character and position, it has probably been a tumour similar to the two previous ones. F. P. C. 2920. 6. 361. Chondroma of Thumb and Forefinger.—Sections of cartilaginous tumours growing from the metacarpal bone of a thumb and the first phalanx of a forefinger—in spirit. The patient, when a boy, had his hand crushed, and afterwards the tumours formed gradually. The sections show that the tumours are composed of numerous small lobules of hyaline cartilage, each apparently surrounded by a very delicate stroma. Some of the nodules seem to have been softening. The surface of each tumour is formed by a thin layer of bone continuous with the bone from which the tumour has grown. Imperfect and irregular- appearances of septa are seen here and there passing inwards from the interior of the bony shell. B. C. i. 6. M. 32. 6. 362. Chondroma of Little Finger.-Metacarpal bone and

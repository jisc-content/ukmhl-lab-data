Diseases of Joints. 476 7. 130. Tubercular (?) Disease of the First Metatarso- phalangeal Joint.—Head of metatarsal bone and phalanges of a great toe—macerated, illustrating the above. " From a man about 60 years of age. The disease originated about twenty years ago in frost-bite. The toe was dislocated at the proximal phalanx, and turned inwards at a right angle. In amputating it the metatarsal bone was cut across." The joint between the metatarsal bone and first phalanx is partly absorbed and roughened by erosions. G. C. 1486. Presented by John Campbell, 17th April 1833. SHOULDER-JOINT. Primarily and chiefly in the Synovial Membrane. 7. 131. Tubercular Synovitis, involving- the Bone.—Bones forming a left shoulder joint—macerated, illustrating the above. " The effect of scrofulous inflammation." The articular surface of the humerus is bared of its smooth plate of bone, and is rarefied and rough. The glenoid cavity is partly affected in the same way, and tbe greater part of the acromion process is deficient; the remaining bone being greatly opened out and in process of absorption. Some new bone has been thrown out round the glenoid cavity and upon the spine. B. C. ii. M. 48. ELBOW-JOINT. a. Changes primarily or chiefly in the Synovial Membrane. 7. 132. Tubercular Synovitis involving" the Articular Surfaces.—Bones forming a right elbow-joint, soft parts re- moved—in spirit, illustrating the above. The arm was amputated, and the patient did well. The articular surface of the humerus is bared of cartilage at some places, and at others the cartilage is undermined, and hangs in loose flakes and tags. Similar changes are seen on the head of the radius, and to a less extent upon the ulna. W. C. H. 38.

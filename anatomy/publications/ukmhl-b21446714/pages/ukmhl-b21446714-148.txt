-Qg Injuries of Bone. The fractured specimen shows the impaction of the neck upon the trochanter. The neck has given way at.Jb* usual place, hut its anterior broken margin, instead of, as m Nos. 5. lÂ» l and 192, being forced in front of the corresponding margin of the lower fragment, has been forced behind it, so as to be embedded in the upper end of the bone. These two modes of union thus each leave a ledge at the line of junction m front It is more usual, however, to find an angle there-see *os.3.193 t0l9The section of the bone shows the restoration of the cancellous tissue except at two points, above and below, where the bone is condensed. The tip of the trochanter is on a some- what higher level than that of the head. The section o the sound siae shows a certain amount of absorption of the cancellous tissue due to old age, but the angle of the neck seemsin^no way alteredpresented by H.

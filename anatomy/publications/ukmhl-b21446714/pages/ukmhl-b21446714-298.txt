Diseases of Bone. 266 The sequestrum shows the usual characteristics. The new tibia is curved forward, and is thickened, especially on its inner surface and behind. There is a well-marked medullary cavity, partially occupied by cancellated tissue, and with compact walls, which are thick and dense, especially about the middle. The thick part is the seat also of the bend, and this was doubtless the place from which the sequestrum came. Probably the bone yielded by being used before it was solid. The thickening may have followed afterwards from strain. Compare the rickety tibia, No. 6. 38. G. C. 1143. Presented by Professor James Russell. 6. 157. Reparation of Tibia after Removal of a Seques- trum. Sequestrum and left tibia in sectionâ€”macerated, illus- trating the above. The specimen was obtained eighteen years after the removal of the sequestrum. The sequestrum, which has consisted of the entire thickness of the shaft, over the greater part of its extent shows the usual characteristics. The new tibia is somewhat bent, but in addition is very irregular. New bone has been thrown out on all sides, but especially over the shin, where there is also a shelf- like projection towards the outer side. The medullary canal has been filled in, if a new one was ever formed. At each end there is a cavity in the cancellous tissue, but these may have been made in preparing the specimen. A large ulcer has probably remained after the sequestrum was removed, and having become chronic, has produced secondary changes upon the newly formed tibia. G. C. 1142.

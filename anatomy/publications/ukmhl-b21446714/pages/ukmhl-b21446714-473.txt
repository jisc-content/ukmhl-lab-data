441 Ttibercular Synovitis of Knee-joint. on 26th October 1891, complaining of a jumping pain in her left knee, when going to sleep. She had no pain when sitting with her leg hanging, but when lying down had pain. She first felt a pain in her knee fourteen years ago, without any apparent cause. It has gradually increased, especially during the last two years. The knee has been blistered with but little effect. The knee is now bent at an angle of 130°, and the leg is everted. There is a wasting of muscles above and below the joint, and the circumference of the joint is two inches greater than on the sound side. The knee was excised on 30th October. The wound healed slowly, leaving a sinus, which was gouged out on 5th January 1892. The necrosed piece was denser than the rest, and on section, when fresh, showed the following points, viz., near the articular surface a layer which was of an opaque yellow colour; next to that one of a more clear, bluish, translucent colour; then the line of demarcation, with soft granulation tissue, and beyond that the cancellous bone. The lower piece of the specimen has been macerated to illustrate the rarefied condition of the bone. The tipper part of the articular surface is covered by shrivelled granulations and has been irregularly eroded. G. C. 3341. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 38. Tubercular Synovitis of the Knee, with Necrosed Patch on the Inner Condyle.—Macerated section of the portion of the inner condyle which contained the necrosed portion in the previous case. The condensed character of the necrosed piece, the line of demarcation round it, and the more open character of the cancellous tissue beyond, can be recog- nised. G. C. 3342. Presented by A. G.

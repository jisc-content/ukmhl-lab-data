Diseases of Joints. 486 margins of the furrow being irregular. Round the articular margin the cartilage has been slightly absorbed by the synovial membrane, and the affected surface as well as the margins of the furrow have been vascular and are injected. One or two patches of the injection are seen upon the cartilage of the femur. The depression on the cartilaginous surface of the trochlea was probably done accidentally while preparing the specimen. The joint otherwise may be considered normal. G. C. 3201. Presented by Charles W. Cathcakt, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 157. Early Stage of Arthritis Deformans(?).—Left knee- joint of an adult—injected and laid open from the front—in spirit, showing changes in the cartilage and synovial membrane. The patient had many chalk stones in different parts of his body. The cartilage on the trochlear surface of the femur is deficient at the centre, and over the condylar surface on both sides it shows numerous small nodules. The cartilaginous surface of the patella is irregularly eroded round the margin, and has lost its smoothness over the rest of the surface. The synovial membrane round the patella and on the femur presents numerous finely fringed processes: B. C. II. M, 14. 7.158. Early Stage of Arthritis Deformans.—A left knee- joint laid open by throwing down the patella —in spirit, showing changes chiefly in the cartilage. The specimen is from a woman aged 62, whose limb was amputated for senile gangrene. The articular margin of the'femur has begun to enlarge, and forms an irregular shelf projecting beyond the surface of the condyle. There is a small patch of eburnated bone at the upper and outer part of the trochlear surface, and below it the cartilage is shreddy, i.e., is in the stage which precedes ebur-

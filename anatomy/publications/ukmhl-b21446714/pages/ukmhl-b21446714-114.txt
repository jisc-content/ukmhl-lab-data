FRACTURES OF THE SCAPULA. 3 102 Ununited Fracture of the Acromion Process and United Fracture of the Vertebral Border.-Left scapula of an adult—macerated—showing the ahove. The acromion process has been separated from the spine, and the margins of the bone are thickened where the pieces meet The fracture at the inferior angle has extended to the vertebral border, and the pieces have united with considerable displacement. The injury to the acromion might, from the position and direction of the line of separation, have been an ununited epiphysis, but the raised margins of bone and the presence of a fracture at another part of the bone render ^the theory of fracture more probable.

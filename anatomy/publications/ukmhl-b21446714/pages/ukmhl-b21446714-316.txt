Diseases of Bone. 284 vascular) bone, higher up vascular granulations are seen, and still higher caseous material lines these granulations. The disease had spread high up in the tibia near to the upper thread, i.e. in the second section of tibia which is attached to the chief specimen. G. C. 2834. Presented by P. H. Maclaken, P.R.C.S.E. 6. 213. Tubercular Abscess and Enlargement of the Lower End of the Tibia.—Lower end of fibula and section of tibia from the previous case—macerated, to illustrate the above. The cavity in the tibia is lined by rarefied bone. On the outside there is much new bone formation. The fibula also shows new periosteal bone on the surface, but the cancellated tissue exposed below is not the result of disease, but from an accident during maceration. G. C. 2835. 6. 214. Tubercular Enlargement of Shaft of the Femur. —Section of a right knee-joint and adjacent bones—injected and in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient was an elderly man. His leg was amputated for chronic ostitis. The femur has been condensed, and the surrounding tissues thickened. The two cavities in the femur were occupied in the recent condition by a semi-transparent gelatinous material, which has been shrivelled and rendered opaque by the spirit. The structure of the tibia is practically normal, and may be compared with that of the femur. A caseous gland is seen in the popliteal space. G. C. 3215. Presented by A. G. Millek, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 215. Tubercular Enlargement of the Shaft of the Femur.—The other half of the bones from the previous preparation—macerated.

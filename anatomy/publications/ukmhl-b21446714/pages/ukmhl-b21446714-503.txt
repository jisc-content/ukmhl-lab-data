Changes primarily or chiefly in the bone. 7. 116. Tubercular Arthritis, involving- the Tibia and Fibula.—Half of the lower end of a right tibia and corre- sponding part of fibula—macerated, illustrating the above. The changes were said to be clue to " scrofulous caries." Both bones are enlarged, and their articular surfaces are irregular. The interior of the tibia is partly occupied by adipocere. (A left astragalus was formerly mounted along with the above bones, but as it shows nothing of importance, it has- been discarded.) F. P. C. 803. Presented by Professor James Russell. 7. 117. Tubercular Arthritis, involving the Bones at the Ankle-Joint and the Os Caleis.—Lower ends of the tibia and fibula of a boy, with remains of the os calcis and astragalus —macerated and in spirit. Amputation was performed. The bones are lightened and considerably altered in shape, but the adipocere formed during maceration masks their condition. q q_ 2169. Presented by Benjamin Bell, Junr., F.R.C.S.E., 1840. 7. 118. Tubercular Arthritis, involving- the Tibia.—Lower end of a right tibia—macerated, illustrating the above. Except at one small place on the outer side, the articular plate of the bone is removed, leaving the surface below rough and irregular. At the back, above the articular surface, but extending downwards into it, there is a large cavity, with

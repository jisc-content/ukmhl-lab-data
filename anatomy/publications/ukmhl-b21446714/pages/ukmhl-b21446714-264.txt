Breathing was very difficult, and the patient very weak. Three weeks later the pleura was incised, and three pints of what seems to have been pus evacuated. When he was admitted, there were several septic sinuses near the inferior angle of the scapula leading down to bare bone on the fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs, and communicating with the pleural cavity.

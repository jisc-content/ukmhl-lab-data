559 Sarcomata. sections. This specimen was formerly numbered G. C. 857, but the description of that number does not at all apply to this specimen. G. C. 857. Presented by Adam Hunter, F.R.C.S.E. 9. 48. Large Sarcoma.—Section of a large sarcomatous tumour— in spirit. " It was removed from the back." The cut surface shows it to consist of an interlacement of strong fibrous bands, forming compartments of variable size, which contain a soft, friable-looking substance, in many places breaking down. G. C. 187. 9. 49. Large Sarcoma.—Section of a large tumour, with adherent skin—in spirit. '1 It was successfully removed from the neck by Sir Everard Home. The patient recovered so well as to leave the hospital, but was then lost sight of." The tumour consists, like the previous specimen, of an inter- lacement of fibrous bands, forming large and smaller subdivisions, the latter of which contain a soft material, in many places breaking down. The spaces, however, in this specimen are larger, and the tumour is more definitely separated into lobules by the connective tissue. The other portion is in the Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons of England. B. C. s. i. M. 4. 9. 50. Large Sarcoma.—Section of a large sarcomatous tumour from the arm, with a portion of the thinned skin which lay over it. This tumour, like the last, is seen on section to be composed of several large masses, separated by fibrous septa, each mass being subdivided by septa into small lobules of soft material. The lobules of several of the masses are softening and breaking down. G. C. 577. Presented by Joseph Bell, F.R.C.S.E.

Syphilitic ' Caries.' 297 6. 247. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.—Skull -cap, with ununited frontal suture—macerated, illustrating the above. Between the temporal ridges the parietal bones have been roughened on the surface, partly by vascular pores, and partly by irregular excavations, which, as in the previous specimen, have been smoothed over. The interior of the bone shows an increased number of channels for the branches of the middle meningeal artery. The sutures are unusually distinct. B. C. i. 7. M. 6. 6. 248. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.—Skull—macerated, illustrating the above. There are marks of previous disease on the frontal, malar, superior maxillary, and sphenoid bones. The frontal bone shows irregular rounded depressions and marks of increased vascularity on its anterior and lateral parts. Both malar bones, but especially the right, are roughened by enlargement of the pores for blood-vessels. A similar condition is seen below the nasal aperture and on the roof of the hard palate. The under surface of the body of the sphenoid behind the nasal septum is absorbed, and Jias an aperture into the sphenoidal sinuses. The interior of the skull shows numerous markings due to increased vascularity, not only on the frontal but also on the parietal bone, on which there are very few marks on the °Utside- B. C. i. 7. M. 20. 6. 249. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.-Skull-cap of an elderly person—macerated, illustrating the above. There are marks of former disease on the frontal and left parietal bones. Several irregular excavations are seen near the frontal eminences, especially on the left side, and there is another above the left parietal eminence. The margins of these am smoothed over as if the disease had subsided. The interior of

Injuries of Bone. 106 impaction. 2. Crepitus, although looked for, was absent immediately after the accident, although against this it is right to set the shortening, which could apparently he overcome. 3. The great shortening of the neck and its impaction into the head are distinctly seen, especially above, while there is no appearance of impaction of the neck into the great trochanter. As is usual in impaction near the head, the outer fragment has been driven into the inner one. The capsule seems thickened. The lower fragment has been everted, and the trochanter is almost on a level with the head. The bone is condensed in the head and at the line of fracture. G. C. 746. Presented by James Begbie, F.R.C.S.E., 1825. 3.173. United Intra-capsular Fracture of the Neck.— Anterior half of the preceding specimen, muscles dissected off —in spirit, showing the above. In addition to indications of impaction seen also in the previous specimen, this one shows in another way the ©version which was present. The head has been pushed back from the front of the neck, thus allowing the upper end of the lower fragment to project in front. The front of the capsule seems also thickened. In both specimens the cartilage covering the head is seen to be eroded as in arthritis deformans. G. C. 746. a. Presented by James Begbie, F.R.C.S.E., 1825. 3. 174. United Intra-capsular Fracture of the Neck.— Anterior half of the upper end of a right femur—muscles cleaned off, and in spirit, showing the above. The line of fracture within the capsule is quite distinct. There has been shortening and eversion, but not impaction. The cancellated tissue has been re-formed, except at the lower part of the neck, where the new bone is condensed. G. C. 2461. Presented by Wm. Sandeus, F.R.C.S.E.

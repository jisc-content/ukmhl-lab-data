93 Fractures of the Radius and Ulna. backwards and towards the radial side; the lower end of the upper fragment projects forwards. Owing to this and to the backward rotation of the lower fragment of the radius the usual hollow on the front of the lower end of the bone has disappeared. The styloid process of the ulna relatively projects. The head is altered. The olecranon process has been broken and is partially united. G. C. 2786. Presented by Johnson Symington, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 135. United Colles' Fracture.—Skeleton of the left hand and forearm of an old woman—cleaned and dried, showing the above. The patient was an old woman, the most of whose bones were in a condition of senile osteo-malacia. The lower end of the radius has been rotated backwards, and has been forced to the radial side. The styloid process of the radius is on the level of that of the ulna. There were no adhesions either in the joints or in the synovial sheaths of the wrist. The flexor carpi ulnaris tendon is in its usual place. G. C. 3220. Presented by Charles "VV. Cathcart, Esq., F.R.C.S.E. 3. 136. United Colles' Fracture.— Bones of a left forearm- macerated—to show the above. The lower end of the radius is displaced outwards and backwards, but with less rotation backwards than is usual. The lower fragment has probably been comminuted. The appear- ances are those of an imperfectly reduced Colles' fracture. Sir Charles Bell describes this specimen as "a fracture of the radius near the wrist. This is a very common accident, and is apt to be mistaken for a dislocation or sprain." B. C. I. 1. M. 53.

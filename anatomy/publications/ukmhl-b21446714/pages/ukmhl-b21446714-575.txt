543 Degeneration of Muscle. supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, and sub-scapularius muscles seem completely degenerated into fibrous and fatty tissue, the triceps, however, being still fairly well developed, and presenting in colour and arrangement a striking contrast to the others. B. C. 4. l M. 1. 3. Atrophy of Muscle from Paralysis,—Portion of the soleus muscle—in spirit, illustrating the above. The muscle has apparently been transformed completely into fat and fibrous tissue. The tendon, however, retains more of its natural appearance. B. C. 4. i. M. 2. C. Changes from Constitutional or other Conditions more or less obscure. 4. Rider's Bone.—Anterior portion of a man's pelvis—dissected, and painted over with glycerine and corrosive sublimate, to illustrate the above. On both sides a strong spur of bone about half an inch in diameter and about two inches long projects from the front of the symphysis pubis just below the crest, and follows the direction of the adductor longus muscle. On the right side the muscles have been dissected off, and the bone on this side has been separated from the pelvis by a fibrous intersection which has been wrenched open. The mode of union is thus seen to have been an irregular form of synchondrosis. On the left side the origins of the muscles have been left, and it can be seen that besides the adductor longus, the greater part of the adductor bxevis, and portions of the pectineus, the gracilis, and the obturator externus take origin from the new spur of bone.

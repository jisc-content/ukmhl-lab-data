Diseases of Synovial Sheaths. 546 9. 9. " Melon Seed " Bodies from Tubercular Affection of Synovial Sheath, "Compound Gang-lion."—Numerous " melon-seed " bodies—in spirit. From a ganglion over the tendon of the extensor communis digitorum muscle. These bodies, often found in enlarged and thickened synovial sheaths, have been proved to be associated with the tubercle bacillus. B. C. n. M. 36. 9. 10. "Melon Seed" Bodies from Tubercular Affection of Synovial Sheath, "Compound Gang-lion."—Numerous melon-seed bodies—in spirit. "These were evacuated by incision from the sheath of the flexor tendons of the middle finger. The patient, a man over 50 years of age, had suffered from this enlargement for six or seven years. Incision was made nearly over the heads of the metacarpal hones. The patient, at first, was greatly relieved." Besides well-formed loose bodies, others were found smaller, and in process of formation, showing the gradual development as enlargements from the inner surface of the synovial sheath, often in the form of fringes.

Large Ganglion near the Wrist.—Plaster of Paris cast of the back of a left hand and wrist, showing an enlargement near the lower end of the ulna. The cast was originally entered as one of a diseased bursa, but from its lobulated character and position over the region of the synovial sheaths at the lower end of the ulna, it has no doubt been a ganglion, possibly associated with arthritis deformans.

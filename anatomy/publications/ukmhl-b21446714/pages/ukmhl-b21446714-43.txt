11 Inflammation. The redness and swelling round the end of the finger may be taken as illustrating an acute inflammation. It was, however, an acute exacerbation rather than a simple acute inflammation. The increased size of the nail indicates the previously congested condition of the parts, and may be taken as an instance of overgrowth from increased vascularity. G. C. 3125. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1889. 1. 33. Increased Vascularity of an Inflamed Part; injected preparation. Specimen required. 1. 34. Effusion of Lymph in Connective Tissues. Specimen required. 1. 35. Effusion of Lymph on a Serous Surface.—Section of the heart of an elderly woman, who died of Pericarditis. The surface of the heart is covered by a layer of soft recent lymph, which at places is peeled off, showing the smooth surface of the pericardium beneath. The surface of the lymph has the characteristic "bread-and-butter" appearance seen in recent cases of pericarditis. G. C. 3183. Presented by T. Burn Murdoch, M.B., CM., 1890. 1. 36. Effusion of Lymph on a Synovial Surface. Specimen required. 1. 37. Effusion of Lymph on a Mucous Surface.—Trachea and part of larynx of a child, laid open from the back—in spirit—showing a false membrane. The child died of croup.

Diseases of Done. 310 6. 272. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull after Separation of Sequestrum.â€”Skull-cap of an old person, probably a woman macerated, illustrating the above. On the frontal bone, to the right of the middle line, and extending downwards from about one and a half inches below the coronal suture, there is a rough irregular depression. It shows a perforation above, and ends in a deep branching groove below. The margins are bevelled off, and in some places the irregularities are rounded as if there the disease had been healing, while at others they are sharp as if it had been extending. The interior of the bone shows marks of increased vascularity, especially on the frontal bone, which is thickened on the right side; and shows irregular depressions on the left. The bone, as a whole, is thin, but the diploe' is condensed. G- C- 367' 6 273. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull-Healing- after Extensive Destruction.-Skull of an adult-macerated, illustrating the above. The disease has been most advanced on the frontal bone and on those of the face, round the nose and mouth. On the outside there is considerable roughness and porosity near the external occipital protuberance. The diploe, where exposed, seems for the most part normal. The whole of the lower part of the frontal bone is also roughened and irregular. Above, the irregularities are shallow, and the surface is smoothed over, but below they are deeper and the bone surface is porous. At one spot the frontal sinus has been opened into. The margins of the anterior nares have been attacked, and the bone is porous. The alveolar border shows similar changes, and many of the teeth must have fallen out shortly before death. The hard palate is roughened, and on the left side is perforated by a small aperture. The interior of the skull shows marks of increased vascularity, especially in the frontal region, but this is less marked than might have been expected fromthe condition of the outside.

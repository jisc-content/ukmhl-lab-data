Arthritis Deformans of Elbow-joint. 503 ELBOW JOINT. 191. Advancing- Arthritis Deformans.—Lower end of a right humerus, with the muscles dissected off—in spirit, illus- trating the above. The articular surface on the lower part of the capitellum is bared of cartilage and smooth. There is also some bony outgrowth at the margins of the trochlear surface. An adimentary bone about the size of a large pea is seen in the olecranon fossa, and must have interfered with the extension of the joint. G. C. 1194. Presented by Adam Hunter, F.E.C.S.E. 192. Advanced Arthritis Deformans.—Bones of a left elbow-joint, with the muscles and synovial membrane dissected away—in spirit, illustrating the above. There is considerable atrophy on the inner side of the . trochlea, and the articular surface has thus the appearance of being tilted up, so as to bring the inner side higher than the outer. The cartilage has been worn off the articular surfaces, and the trochlear surface, now covered by smooth bone, is marked by deep grooves. The head of the radius is greatly enlarged all round, while its cartilage is partially eroded. The coronoid and olecranon fossae are shallow, but a new depres- sion has been formed above the capitellum for the enlarged head of the radius. The articular margins of the humerus and ulna are enlarged, and one adimentary bone is seen on the coronoid process of the ulna, and another on the back of the trochlear surface. G. C. 3246.

The joint has been opened, and the humerus rotated

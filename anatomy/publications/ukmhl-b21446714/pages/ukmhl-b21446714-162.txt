Injuries of Bone. 130 3. 238. Badly united Fracture about the Middle of the Shaft— Eight femur—macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment, sharply pointed, over-rides in front of the lower, and at a distance from it of about 1| inches, and yet the interval is partly filled up by dense callus. The lower fragment is tilted outwards below, and is rotated slightly out- wards. Figured in Bell's "Observations on Injuries of Spine and Thigb Bone," pi. vi. fig. 2. B. C. i. 1. M. 25. 3. 239. Badly united Fracture, a little below the Middle Of the Shaft.—Eight femur—macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment over-rides in front of the lower, and at a distance from it of about 1J inches, and yet the interval is completely filled up by dense callus. The medullary cavity of each fragment has been closed over, and, as in many of the previous specimens, the callus has a smooth outer shell, con- tinuous with the adjacent portions of the shaft. The fragments are in line, and the lower one is rotated slightly outwards. B. C. i. 1. M. 33. k. 3 240. Badly united Fracture at the Junction of the Middle and Lower Thirds of the Shaft-Left femur- macerated, showing the above. The bones are united in a manner similar to that seen m the foregoing specimen, but with less interval between the fractured ends. The upper fragment is in front of the lower. Above the seat of fracture it is curved outwards and forwards, and its diameter, increased in the direction of the curve is flattened from side to side. The lower fragment is rotated outwards, but is very little changed in appearance.

182 Injuries of Bone. 3. 390. Gunshot Shattering of Foot.—Bones of a left foot- partially macerated and dried, and showing great laceration of the tarsus and lower end of the tibia. The internal cuneiform hone, scaphoid, and astragalus are broken up into unrecognisable fragments, while the lower end of the tibia and sustentaculum tali of the os calcis have been severely comminuted. The other bones of the foot and the fibula have escaped. G. C. 3434. Presented by Surgeon-General Billings, U.S.A. COMPARATIVE PATHOLOGY OF FEACTURES. 3. 391. Process of Union after Fracture in the Bones of Birds.—Two humeri, also portions of a metatarsal bone and of the tibia and fibula of two chickens—macerated, after experi- mental fracture. No account is given of the details of the experiments, but the specimens all show development of callus round the broken ends. The uppermost specimen shows enlargement of the lower half of the bone. Both the humeri exhibit a closing of the medullary cavity in the upper fragment, and the three lower broken bones show necrosis at the seat of fracture, with much new bone formed round it. G. C. 206. 3. 392. United Fractures in the Bones of Birds—Series of sections through united fractures of three bones, apparently femora, of fowls—macerated. The bones have united in bad position in each case, but the overlapping ends have been covered in, and the interval between the bones filled up by cancellous tissue. In the sections of the two lower fractures the original shell is distinguishable at the point of fracture, but in the uppermost fracture its two sections show the original shell to have become blended with the intervening cancellous tissue.

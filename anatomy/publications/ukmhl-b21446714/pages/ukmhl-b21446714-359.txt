Syphilitic Enlargement. 327 6. 323. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia.—Left tibia- macerated, illustrating the above. About the middle there is a considerable thickening, the surface of which is smooth behind, but irregular and porous on the inner side. B. C. i. 5. M. 70. 6. 324. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia.—Middle third of a left tibia—macerated, illustrating the above. There is a considerable periosteal thickening on the inner and posterior aspects, and its surface is rough and porous all over. G. C. 1006. 6. 325. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia.—Left tibia- macerated, illustrating the above. A churchyard specimen. The shaft is encrusted with periosteal bone all over, but especially along the back, and near the lower end of the inner surface, where a node has been developed. The surface of the new bone is partially destroyed, probably from its having been buried. B. C. I. 5. M. 49. 6. 326. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia. —Left tibia- macerated, illustrating the above. The whole of the bone from the upper third to within an inch of the lower articular surface is thickened by periosteal deposit, especially on the anterior and lateral aspects. The surface of the enlargement is unusually irregular, and at places has been rarefied and eroded. The bone is increased in weight. G. C. 1005. . 327. Syphilitic Enlargement of Tibia and Fibula.— Lower halves of a right tibia and fibula—macerated, illustrating the above.

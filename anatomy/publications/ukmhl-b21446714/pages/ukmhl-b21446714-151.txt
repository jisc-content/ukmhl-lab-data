119 Fractures of the Femur. capsular fracture, and that, last of all, the neck was broken close to the head. The adjacent surfaces of both fragments are very irregular, but have been rounded off by vital processes. This specimen is figured in Bell's "Observations on Injuries of the Spine and Thigh Bone," plate viii. fig. 3. B. C. r. 1. M. 16. 3. 206. United Oblique Fracture above the Small Troch- anter.—Upper end of the shaft of a right femur, with a section through the head and neck, to illustrate the above—macerated. The specimen was taken from a subject in the Dissecting Rooms. The head, neck, and great trochanter have been split off from the small trochanter and shaft. The upper fragment has been tilted outwards, but not forwards. This displacement is probably dependent upon the direction of the obliquity of the fracture, which has run from within outwards and downwards, leaving the psoas and iliacus muscles upon the lower fragment. The spaces seen in the interior of the bone were filled by a brown, jelly-like material. Bony union has been complete. G. C. 3255. Presented by Johnson Symington, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 207. United Oblique Fracture above the Small Tro- chanter.—Upper end of a right femur, head and neck wanting —macerated, to illustrate the above. The line of fracture has begun at the back, about one inch above the small trochanter, and has thence passed obliquely downwards and forwards for three or four inches. In this specimen also the direction of the obliquity has apparently determined the displacement. The head, neck, and great trochanter have been obliquely split off from the shaft and small trochanter. The upper fragment is tilted forwards, and the two over-ride. G. C. 2276.

79 Fractures of the Thorax. 3. 90. Old-standing- Lateral Dislocation of the last Dorsal from the first Lumbar Vertebrae.—Lower six dorsal and upper four lumbar vertebrae, from a boy. The specimen is in spirit, and the muscles are cleaned off, and the spinal canal laid open from behind to show the results of the above condition. He was knocked down by a stage-coach, and survived the accident eleven months, although quite paralysed in his lower limbs. He died of croup. The vertebrae are completely dislocated laterally. The spinal cord is torn through, and its ends—indicated by bristles— are seen about lh inch apart, embedded in fibrous tissue. Along the front of the preparation a mass of new fibrous tissue unites the bones. Figured in Bell's "Observations on Injuries of the Spine and Thigh Bone," plate ii. figs. 2 and 3. B. C. 1. 4. M. 9. 3. 91. Gunshot Injury Of the Spine.—Bodies of two dorsal ver- tebrae—macerated and dried—showing a round bullet embedded at the back of one of them. The injury was received in an encounter with smugglers. The ball perforated the lateral part of the bone, and was stopped by the longitudinal ligament, which it pushed out so as to destroy the spinal cord. The bullet had evidently entered on the right side of the body, and passed backwards. It has penetrated, without fractur- ing, the cancellous tissue. B. C. xvn. 11. FEACTUEES OF THE THOEAX. FRACTURE OF THE STERNUM. 3. 92. Fracture Of the Sternum.—Sternum and costal cartilages of an adult, partially cleaned—in spirit—showing a fracture near the lower end. A stone fell and crushed the man's chest, breaking several ribs, about half-way round. The lung was compressed and bruised between

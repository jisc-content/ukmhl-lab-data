434 Diseases of Joints. •are seen on the other half (below). The fatty condition of the epiphyseal end of the shaft of the femur is very marked, and the same may be seen on the tibia, but to a less extent. As in the previous specimens, the condition of the epiphyses seems healthy, while that of the adjacent ends of the shaft is fatty and of a dark brown colour. G. C. 3182. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 22. Tubercular Synovitis, following- Partial Dislocation. Parts of a knee-joint removed by excision—in spirit, showing slight outward dislocation of the tibia, with extensive destruction of the cartilaginous surfaces. Four years before admission to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, the patient, a lad aged 20, in jumping into a cart, had struck his knee ■on the tram. Displacement occurred at once, and remained in spite of repeated attempts to restore it. Before operation the joint was swollen, slightly flexed, tender to the touch, and painful when moved. The tibia was displaced outwards and slightly rotated backwards. At the operation the articular surfaces were found to have adhesions in process of formation. These had to be broken down to allow of the excision. In this case tubercular synovitis distinctly followed the injury. The articular cartilages of the joint have been entirely replaced by irregular granulations, now blanched and shrivelled by the spirit. G. C. 2890. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 23. Tubercular Synovitis, following- Partial Dislocation. —Papier-mache cast of knee before operation, from which the foregoing specimen was taken, to show the swelling of the joint and the lateral displacement of the tibia.

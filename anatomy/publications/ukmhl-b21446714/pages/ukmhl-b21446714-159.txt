127 Fractures of tlie Femur. amount of dense new bone has been thrown out round the seat of fracture. On the surface of the callus there are numerous apertures for the entrance of blood-vessels. B. C. i. 1. M. 33. e. 229. Badly united Fracture about the Middle of the Shaft.—Left femur—macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment has been tilted"forwards and inwards ; the lower end is rotated slightly outwards. The broken ends over-ride, and are separated by a considerable interval which is filled up by dense new bone formation. The broken ends of the bone must at one time have exposed the medullary cavity, but this is now covered in by new bone. Figured in Bell's "Observ. on Injuries of Spine and Thigh Bone," plate vi. fig. 3. B. C. i. 1. M. 26. 230. Double Fracture of the Shaft united in Bad Posi- tion.—Shaft and upper end of the left femur of an adult macerated, to show the above. This was the thigh-bone of a madman, who threw himself out of the window, and kicked and struggled so that they could by no means secure the position of the limb. The thigh-bone in its natural state was 18 inches in length ; it is now only 13 inches. It lost 5 inches in length, yet to that diminution had the muscles adapted themselves. There has been over-riding at both fractures, and great distortion at the upper one. The medullary cavity has been partially covered in, and the uniting bone at both fractures is still cancellous. Figured in Bell's "Observ. on Injuries of Spine and Thigh Bone," plate vi. fig. 6. B. C. i. 1. M. 23. 231. United Fracture about the Middle of the Shaft.

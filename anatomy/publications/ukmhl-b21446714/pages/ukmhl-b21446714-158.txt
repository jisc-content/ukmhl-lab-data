126 Injuries of Bone. 3. 225. Badly united Fracture a little below the Lesser Trochanter.—Plaster cast of the pelvis and thighs of the patient from whom the previous specimen was taken. The cast shows the distortion of the injured thigh, con- sequent upon the irregular union of the fractured femur. B. C. i. 1. M. 32. 3. 226. Badly united Fracture through the Upper Third Of the Shaft.—Inner section of the upper end of a right femur—macerated, showing the ahove. The head is wanting. There has been a fracture about three inches below the lesser trochanter, and the upper fragment has over-ridden in front of the lower. The ends of the bones have been encased in an irregular mass of cancellous tissue, which has also interrupted the medullary cavity. The upper fragment is tilted forwards and slightly outwards. B. C. i. 1. M. 33. i. 3. 227. United Fracture at the Junction of the Upper and Middle Thirds.—Left femur of a strong man-macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment is tilted slightly forwards, but the union is otherwise good. There is not much callus at the seat of fracture, yet the whole bone is heavier than it should be. The difference between the weight of the bone in this and in No 3. 223 may have been due to the difference in age of the individuals. This specimen has probably been taken from a middle-aged, the other from an old person. B. C. i. 1. M. 27. 3 228. United Fracture about the Middle of the Shaft.- ' Inner half of the central portion of the shaft of a left femur —macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment has been tilted forwards, and a large

Burn Murdoch, M.B., 1892. 11. 54. Dupuytren's Contraction.—Photograph of a right hand, showing a marked contraction of the third and little fingers, before operation. The patient was an alcoholic man, aged 48. The condition, which had grown gradually worse, had existed for fifteen or twenty years, and was supposed to have been due to lilting 56 lbs. weights in a sugar refinery. At first there was acute pain during the beginning of the flexion, but this passed away, and latterly there was no pain. The hands, however, were useless for manual work. G. C. 3405. Presented by T. Burn Murdoch, M.B., 1892. 11. 55. Dupuytren's Contraction.—Plaster of Paris cast of the hand shown in the previous case after the operation by division of the bands and stretching. It shows a marked improvement in both the affected fingers. G. C. 3406. Presented by T. Burn Murdoch, M.B., 1892. 11. 56. Dupuytren's Contraction.—Plaster of Paris cast of the left hand of the same patient, illustrating the above. There has been a slight contraction of the middle finger, and marked contraction of the ring and little fingers. There is a slight formation of a band on the palm, due to contraction of the fascia.

285 Tuhermlar Enlargement. The sclerosed condition of the femur is a striking contrast to that of the tibia, which is, if anything, atrophied. The cavities in this half of the femur correspond to those previously noticed in the other half. The periosteal surface of the femur shows irregularity from a deposit of new bone. G. C. 3216. 6.216. Tubercular Enlargement of the Shaft of the Femur.—Section of the lower end of a right femur—macerated, illustrating the above. " The patient was a woman aged 40. She had long complained of a deep-seated pain in and near the knee-joint, for which she had been blistered, but without much benefit. She died of phthisis pulmonalis." The specimen shows a combination of erosion with new bone formation. The erosion is seen partly in the interior, where the cancellous tissue is destroyed, and partly on the surface, near the lower end, where there are pits and irregular excavations. The new bone formation is seen as an irregular crust on the surface of the lower end of the shaft, resembling the crust due to the irritation of pus-forming organisms. G. C. 858. Presented by Sir George Ballingall. 6.217. Tubercular Enlargement of the Shaft of the Femur.-Other half of the previous preparation-in spirit, illustrating the above. The spaces in the interior of the bone are occupied by granulation tissue, shrivelled up by the spirit. On the surface similar material has been left in one or two places. G. C. 858 a. Presented by Sir John Ballingall. c Where the chief changes are in the form of necrosis, combined with absorption or enlargement, or both. 6.218. Tubercular Disease of the Head of the Tibia.- Upper end of a left tibia-macerated, illustrating the above.

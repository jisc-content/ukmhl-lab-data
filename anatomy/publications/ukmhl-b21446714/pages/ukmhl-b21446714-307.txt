Necrosis from Septic Wounds. 275 6. 185. Septic Osteo myelitis and Necrosis, following- Gun- shot (Compound) Fracture of the Ribs.—Portion of a chest wall—in spirit, illustrating the above. The ribs are broken and greatly comminuted, and some portions have apparently been necrotic. The pleura is thick- ened and covered with lymph. A small portion of lead was found in the soft parts, thus giving a clue to the possible cause of the condition. cx n qqk£ (6.) Where the dead piece has become loose, but has remained in position, and has acted as a source of irritation. 6.186. Septic Osteo-myelitis and Necrosis of the Tibia following Fracture (Compound?).—Lower end of the left femur of a child, along with the tibia and fibula—partially cleaned and dried, to illustrate the above. "The injury was received on 1st February 1805, and the limb was removed on 10th October in that year. The process of regeneration being exceedingly slow, amputation was performed in order to save the patient." The upper two-thirds of the shaft of the tibia is smooth, and has been separate from the epiphysis and adjacent soft parts.' Its lower end is concealed by a shell of new bone in which there is a cloaca. The sequestrum shows a sharp margin at the back just above the level of the new shell. The fracture has therefore probably been at the lower end. The texture of the lower end of the femur is thin and light. G. C. 1178. Presented by Professor James Kussell. 17.

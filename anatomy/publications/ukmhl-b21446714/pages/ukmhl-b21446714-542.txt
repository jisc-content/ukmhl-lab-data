Early Stage of Lateral Curvature.—A spinal column, pelvis, and thorax—macerated, illustrating the above. The patient died of disease of the lungs. The spinal column is in a somewhat stooping position, and there is a slight curvature with convexity to the left in the dorsal region. The thorax on the right side is compressed, the ribs being approximated. Originally entered as an illustration of the form of curva- ture depending upon contraction of the chest from collapse of the lungs. B. C. i. 3. M. 21. Figured in Shaw on "Distortion," plate iii. fig. 1. 7. 209. Early Stage of Lateral Curvature.—Cervical dorsal and upper part of lumbar portion of a spine, with ribs, and part of manubrium sterni—macerated, illustrating the above. A gentle lateral curvature is seen convex to the right from the second dorsal vertebra downwards, and with a slight rotation of the bodies towards the convexity. The ribs on the concave side are, as usual, pressed together, while those on the convex side are separated. Owing to the very slight amount of rotation, the projection backwards of the angles of the ribs on the convex side is only just appreciable, while the flattening

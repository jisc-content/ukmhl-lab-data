91 Fractures of the Radius and Ulna. 3. 129. United fracture of the Radius between the attach- ments of the Pronator Radii Teres and Supinator Brevis.—Plaster of Paris cast of a right radius showing the above. The fracture has united in a bad position in two ways. Besides a distinct angular deformity there has been a relative rotation of the two fragments ; the upper is in supination, and the lower in pronation. This latter deformity can only be prevented by treating the fractured limb in the supine position. G. C. 3089. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 130. Fracture of the Radius, below the Pronator Radii Teres.—Eight radius—macerated—showing the above. The fracture has been badly united. The ends overlap, and the upper fragment has been drawn inwards, and has evidently been united to the ulna, while the lower fragment is somewhat pronated. W. C. G. 17. 3. 131. Fracture of the Radius beween the Pronator Radii Teres and the Pronator Quadratus.—Longitudinal section through a right radius—macerated—showing the above. The fragments overlap, and the lower one has been drawn inwards, and is pronated. The medullary canal where exposed on the overlapping fragments has been closed in, but it has not been re-established in the interior. F. P. C. 75. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 3. 132. United Fracture of the Radius near its Lower End.—Skeleton of a left forearm—cleaned and dried, showing the above. The radius at the seat of fracture, i.e. about two inches

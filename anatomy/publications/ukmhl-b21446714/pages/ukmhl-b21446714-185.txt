Fractures into the Ankle-Joint. 153 3. 309. United Fracture of the Tibia and Fibula into the Ankle-joint.—Anterior half of a section of the lower end of a right tibia and fibula—macerated, showing the above. The fracture in the tibia has been oblique from above and inside downwards and outwards, while the fracture in the fibula has been from behind downwards and forwards. The lines of fracture in the two bones have met at the interosseous space, just above the ankle-joint. The fracture in each case is soundly united, and the two bones are welded together immediately above the ankle-joint. B. C. r. 1. M. 46. b. 3.310. Fracture of Tibia into the Ankle-joint, with Anchylosis.—Eight tibia, with section through its lower end, passing also through an anchylosed astragalus and os calcis— macerated. Evidently this has been a comminuted fracture of the lower end of the tibia, with some displacement forwards of the lower fragment. There is an osseous anchylosis between the tibia and the astragalus, and between the'astragalus and the os calcis- G. C. 364. (h.) Chiefly involving the Fibula. 3.311. Recent Compound Fracture of the Fibula, Astragalus, and OS Calcis.—Lower ends of a right tibia and fibula, with the astragalus, scaphoid, cuboid, and part of the os calcis—macerated, showing the above. The patient was a young man, whose foot had been badly crushed. An effort was made to save the limb, but the wound became septic, and amputation could not be avoided. The fibula is comminuted and split into the ankle. The astragalus is also split, and the greater part of the os calcis was removed as loose fragments. G. C. 3376. Presented by Charles W.

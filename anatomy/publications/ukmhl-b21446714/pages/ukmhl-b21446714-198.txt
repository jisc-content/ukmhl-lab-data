166 Injuries of Bone. protruded, and there has been periostitis above that, similar to what was noted in No. 3. 342. Some erosions are present upon the surface of the lower fragments. B. C. xvn. 33. 3. 345. Severe Gunshot Fracture of the Lower End of the Femur.—The lower end of the shaft of a right femur- macerated. Several pieces are missing, and the remaining fragments are wired together. The wound was received at Waterloo. The condylar portion of the bone has been split in several directions. The joint has been opened into, and, from the erosion of the articular surface, must have been the seat of suppuration. The lower end of the upper fragment shows changes similar to those noted in No. 3. 342 and others. F. P. C. 239. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 3. 346. Gunshot Injury of the Inner Condyle of the Femur. —Lower half of a right femur—macerated, to show the above. This wound was received at Corunna. Suppuration of the limb followed the injury, and extended among the muscles of the calf. The patient was exhausted by hectic fever when amputation was performed. In Sir Charles Bell's drawing of this specimen ("Operative Surgery," plate ii. fig. 1) the ball is seen lodged in the depression, in front of the inner condyle. The walls of the cavity have some necrotic fragments still adhering to them, but at other places the bony lining has been somewhat condensed. The outer shell of bone is splintered. B. C. xvn. . 3. 347. Gunshot Injury of the Back of the Outer Condyle Of the Femur-Lower end of a left femur-macerated, to illustrate the above. A musket ball had lodged in the back of the outer condyle at the battle of Waterloo.

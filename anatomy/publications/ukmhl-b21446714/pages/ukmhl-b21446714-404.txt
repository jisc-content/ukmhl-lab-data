James Lewsley, aged 17.— I observed this young man in the waiting-room, as an Out-patient. He said his friends alarmed him by saying that he was going to have a white swelling in his knee. I found a disease, not in his knee, but in the head of the tibia, a tumour which to the eye appeared like a swelling over the bone; but which, on examining it more particularly was obviously attended with an enlargement of the bone. Three months before this he bad experienced a slight pain on the inside of the knee and head of the tibia and it has continued till the present.

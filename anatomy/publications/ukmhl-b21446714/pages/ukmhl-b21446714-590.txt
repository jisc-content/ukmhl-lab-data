Diseases of Connective Tissue. 558 9.44. SarCOm?,.—Portion of a small tumour which has apparently fungated through the skin—in spirit. It seems on section to have a somewhat variable consist- ence. C. 763. 9. 45. Sarcoma.—^ungating tumour, laid open from behind, with the adjacent skin attached—in spirit. The tumour was dissected from over the crest of the ilium of a man aged 60 years. The patient recovered perfectly from the operation. The cut surface of the tumour shows a series of delicate septa of fibrous tissue, separating lobules of a soft material, which is in some places breaking down. The tumour has the appearance of being encapsuled on its deep aspect. G. C. 778. Presented by William Njswbigging, F.R.C.S.E. 1826. 9. 46.

It occupied the whole side of the neck above the clavicle, and '' seemed to originate in the cellular substance, the muscles over it being expanded, and the cervical nerves " (passing) "through it apparently sound. The tumour was of a rich dark brown colour, and consisted chiefly of a pulpy matter, contained in a fibrous network. The spirits have removed the colour." Except that the lobules are smaller, the structure of this specimen is similar to that of the last. G. C. 228. Presented by Professor J. W. Turxek. 9. 47. Very Large Sarcoma.—Section of an enormous tumour— in spirit. It has a variable consistence having evidently been softening in some places more than in others. It is largely composed of a structure like that of the foregoing specimen, in which strands of delicate fibrous tissue intersect a soft substance. In many places, however, the soft substance shows no inter- *

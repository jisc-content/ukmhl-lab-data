507 Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E. Rheumatic Arthritis. 7. 200. Rheumatic Changes in the Metatarso-phalang-eal Joints.—Heads of left metatarsal bones—in spirit, illustrating the above. From the foot of a mail, aged 45, whose leg was amputated for a chronic ulcer, ending in epithelioma. The hones of the foot were anchylosed and considerably altered in many ways. The cartilage of the two outer metatarsals is marked by grooves filled with fibrous tissue. The head of these two bones is irregular in shape. On the two inner toes the cartilage is at places worn away, especially on the under side. That on the second toe is cut to expose the bone. The changes in this specimen may be due to causes other than rheumatism, although the condition resembles what is described as due to rheumatism. G. C. 2794. c.

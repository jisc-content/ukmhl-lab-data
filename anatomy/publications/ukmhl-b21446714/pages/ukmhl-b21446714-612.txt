The patient was a man aged 50, who had suffered from infantile paralysis in childhood. The limb had been completely paralysed, and the foot was so much in the way that he desired to have it amputated. The preparation shows that the cuboid and scaphoid bones- have been displaced inwards, leaving a portion of the articular surfaces of the astragalus and os calcis exposed.. These surfaces,, which formed a projection on the outer side of the foot, were in the recent state covered with fibrous tissue. The bones are- light and fatty. & 0. 3315. Presented by A. G.

Turnovers of Lower Jaw. 401 Although the limits of the tumour are fairly well defined, there is no distinct capsule. From this fact, as well as from the comparatively rapid growth of the tumour, a return might have been expected, and its absence confirms the view held of the relatively simple character of these tumours. This tumour has the usual microscopical characters of a myeloid-celled sarcoma. G. C. 2728. Presented by Joseph Bell, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 486. Myeloid Tumour of the Lower Jaw.—Portion of the right half of a lower jaw, near the angle—in spirit, illustrating the above. A large central tumour has grown outwards, partly expand- ing and partly replacing the bone. G. C. 3141. Presented by Macdonald Brown, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 487. Tumour of the Lower Jaw of a Sheep.—Left half of the lower jaw of a sheep—macerated, illustrating the above. There is a hollow, rounded tumour at the symphisis. Pre- sented as a specimen of "spina ventosa." G. C. 1850. Presented by John Campbell, F.R.C.S.E., 1837. 6. 488. Epithelioma involving- the Lower Jaw.—Portion of the left half of a lower jaw, with adjacent soft parts—in spirit, illustrating the above. A broken-down (probably secondary) epitheliomatous tumour has been attacking the outer surface of the jaw. Previously described as a "carcinomatous tumour." G. C. 1186. Presented by Adam Hunter, F.R.C.S.E., 1828. 6. 489. Epithelioma involving- the Lower Jaw.—Section of piece of a lower jaw—in spirit, illustrating the above. It was removed for recurrent epithelioma. The alveolar border has been attacked, and | has been absorbed by the advancing tumour, some of which is seen in the interior. Q> a 28g9_ Presented by Professor T. Annandale. 2 c

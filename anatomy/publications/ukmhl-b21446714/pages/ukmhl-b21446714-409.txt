377 Central Sarcomata. The tumour, when fresh, appeared to the naked eye to be a sarcoma infiltrating the muscles and tissues of the leg, with large areas of degeneration and blood extravasation. Micro- scopically, it was found to be a "fibro-sarcoma." The greater part of the interior of the tumour was so soft and diffluent that it was washed out from what is now seen as an empty space. The upper end of the fibula is completely destroyed, but there are some plates of bone still remaining in the wall of the tumour. The tumour has, therefore, evidently burst through the fibula, after having partially expanded it. The muscles are stretched over the tumour, and partly involved in ifc- G. C. 3233. Presented by P. H. Watson, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 432. Central Sarcoma of Fibula.—Lower end of a right fibula—macerated, illustrating the above. The bone about the middle has been transformed into a hollow shell, the wall of which is in some places very thin, while at others it is half an inch thick, and is composed of cancellated tissue. The lining of the interior shows irregular cavities. This specimen was formerly described as a case of "spina ventosa." w< a G 2g_ 6. 433. Central Sarcoma of Tibia.—Part of a right femur and bones of the leg and foot of a child—macerated, illustrating the above. The lower half of the tibia has been destroyed by whal must have been a central tumour. The affected part is represented merely by a membrane at the back and outer side, continuous above with the shaft. The interior of what remains of the cavity is smooth. The fibula in the region of the tumour has been flattened out into an elongated

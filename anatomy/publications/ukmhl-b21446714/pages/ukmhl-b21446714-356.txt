324 Diseases of Bone. 6.312. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia.-RigM tibia macerated, illustrating the above. There is a comparatively new periosteal node or enlarge- ment on the posterior and inner surfaces, near the upper endr with marks of increased vascularity on the outer surface lower down The bone is somewhat increased in weight. B. C. i. 5. M. 72.. 6. 313. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia.-Left tibia- macerated, illustrating the above. There are two distinct nodes on the shaft,-one small, on the anterior ridge two inches below the tubercle, and the other, much longer and larger, on the posterior and inner surfaces, about the middle. A slight periosteal crust is seen just beside the outer tuberosity, on the outer surface. The i • • -U4- W. C. G. 40. bone is increased m weight. 6 314. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia.-Lower half of a right tibia-macerated, illustrating the above. A lar^e periosteal node occupies the greater part of the inner surface, and extends to the back and outside. Its surface is porous, as if the process had been still active. The bone is somewhat increased in weight. k. U I. 0. iu. . 6. 315. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia.-Left tibia- macerated, illustrating the above. The posterior and outer surfaces are thickened and rough- ened from new periosteal formation. The lower end of the W and the front and upper parts of the shin surface are ntivPlv unchanged. This condition resembles the nodes comparatively uncnan0eu. seen in previous specimens, only more d*-d. The bone ,s little increased in weight.

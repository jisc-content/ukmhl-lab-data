Millee, F.R.C.S.E., 1892. 1. 12. Hypertrophy of Bone due to Mechanical Irritation. —Bones of the fore-limb of a fox, in which a wire loop has been embedded by the formation of new bone round it. The specimen was obtained from the leg of an adult fox, which had been recently killed. '' The skin was perfectly healed up, and there was no mark exter- nally, except a narrow line of yellow hair round the black part of the paw, showing where the skin had been cut by the wire. It is evident that the animal had got his foot entangled in a snare set for rabbits, that he had first drawn it so tight as to cut through the flesh to the bone, and then had succeeded in breaking the wire" (letter from donor). From the comparative smoothness of the new bone, the condition must have been one of long standing. No doubt at first there must have been much inflammation, and that probably septic. G.

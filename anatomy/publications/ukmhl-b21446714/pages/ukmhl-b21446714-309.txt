Necrosis from Septic Wounds. 277 new bone and a rarified portion of the original shaft. Much new periosteal bone has been thrown out on the surface all round. The case has probably been one of compound fracture. W. C. G. 58. 6. 191. Septic Osteo-myelitis, Necrosis, and Enlargement of the Tibia following- Amputation.—Upper third of a right tibia—macerated, illustrating the above. A considerable portion of dead bone is seen running up upon the inner side, and its lower end has been part of a sawn surface. It has been separated, but has been fixed in position by partial development of new bone round it. The rest of the shaft of the tibia shows new bone growth on the surface and absorption within. Probably two other large pieces of necrosed bone have been removed from the gaps on the front and outer sides- B. C.i. 5. M. .32. 6. 192. Septic Osteo myelitis, Necrosis, and Enlargement of the Tibia following Amputation.—Upper three-fourths of a right tibia—macerated, illustrating the above. There is a partial development of new bone on the surface, with a deficiency in front and on the inside, from which a sequestrum has probably been removed. The exposed portions of the original shaft are rarefied. G. C. 985. 6. 193. Septic Osteo-myelitis, Necrosis, and Enlargement Of the Femur following Amputation.-Greater portion of the shaft of a femur—macerated, illustrating the above. The bone has been greatly thickened, and the surface presents the usual characters of new periosteal bone formation There are four cloacal apertures, through some of which dead pieces of bone can be seen. A necrosed fragment has evidently been removed from the centre of the lower end and from the front of the upper end. B. C. i 5 M 30

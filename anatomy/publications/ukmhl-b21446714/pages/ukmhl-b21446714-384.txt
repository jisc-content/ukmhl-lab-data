It may be noted that the position of the tendinous attachments about the great trochanter shows little or no tendency to ossification, and, while the new masses of bone seem to have run into the substance of some of the muscles, other muscles in the neighbourhood—for instance, the iliacus— seem to have escaped entirely. The whole bone is very heavy. G. C. 3414. Presented by T. M. Burn Murdoch, M.D. 6. 374. Ossification in Adductor Magnus Muscle (" Myositis Ossificans ").-Plaster cast of a left femur in the Barclay Collection, illustrating the above. Attached to the femur there is a large mass, corresponding to the position of the adductor magnus muscle. The was cancellous in texture. 6 375 Ossification in Vastus Internus Muscle ("Myositis Ossificans")—^ femur, lower end injured-macerated, illustrating the above. About the middle of the inner and anterior surface of the shaft there is a projecting piece of bone, which has apparently been an ossification in the vastus internus muscle (jr. U. loOO.

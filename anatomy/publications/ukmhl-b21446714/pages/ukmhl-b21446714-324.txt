292 Diseases of Bone. , 6. 236. Healed Tubercular Disease of the Bodies of Verte- DP3ef_Sectioii of the lower six dorsal vertebrae—macerated, illustrating the above. The bodies of the eighth, ninth, and tenth vertebra are greatly absorbed, and are infused into one mass of cancellated bone, with only a perceptible trace of the original inter-vertebral discs'. The other bodies have been more or less anchylosed on the external surface, and the laminai and spines of the vertebrae whose bodies are blended are fused together likewise. The specimen shows how completely a tubercular affection of bone vao1 B. C. i. 3. M. 62. may heal. 6. Inflammation of Bone clue to Syphilis. A. The Skull a. Where the chief changes are in the form of rarefaction, i.e. a syphilitic form of caries. (a.) Where the process of rarefaction has been advancing. 6. 237. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.-Skull-cap apparently of an old man—macerated, illustrating the above. There are patches of opened-out bone ("caries") near the vertex. These patches seem to be due to localised increased vascularity, the opened-out vascular channels in places running together, and forming deficiencies on the surface. The greater part of the vault of the skull is otherwise unchanged, excepting for a slight porosity of the frontal bone. The interior of the skull-cap shows, near the vertex, marks of considerable vas- cularity, both in grooves for larger vessels and m pores for smaller ones. There is some irregularity also near the coronal suture The sagittal suture is entirely obliterated, and the ° "F P C 291 coronal suture nearly so. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 6 238. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.-Skull-cap of an elderly person-macerated, illustrating the above. There are traces of syphilitic disease on the outside, and

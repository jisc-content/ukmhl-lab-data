229 Bone affected by Neighbouring Congestion. There is great periosteal development on the surface of both bones, especially at their lower ends. On the outer side of the lower end of the fibula the surface is porous, and has evidently formed part of the floor of an extensive ulcer. This surface presents a striking contrast to that of the other portions of both bones. At other places the character of the outgrowths and the condition of the surface is similar to that seen in jSTos. 6. 61 and 6. 63. It should be noted that at the lower end of the fibula, besides the thickening of the bone and the porous character of the surface, there are at one or two places distinct depressions or erosions. It would appear, therefore, that the ulcer as it progressed and deepened had first induced the bony outgrowth, then opened out its surface, and finally had begun to attack it. jr p q 433 Presented by Professor John Thomson. * 68. Bony Outgrowths on the Tibia and Fibula, associ- ated with Chronic Ulcer of the Leg-.—Lower two- thirds of a left tibia and fibula—macerated, to show the above. The bones are anchylosed at their lower ends, and the changes are chiefly in the fibula. This bone, especially near its lower end, is greatly thickened, and its surface is covered by irregular foliacious masses. The tibia shows, about five inches from its lower end, a very marked node, with a portion pro- jecting shelf-like towards the fibula. The surface of this node, as well as the surfaces of some of the irregular projections on the fibula at a lower level, are porous, and probably formed the base of an extensive ulcer. The rest of the tibia is com- paratively free from bony outgrowth, except at the upper part of the outer surface, where irregular deposits are present. B. C. r. 6. M. 24. ».

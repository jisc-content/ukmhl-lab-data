Diseases of Bone. 288 tarsal Bone.— Metatarsal bone of great toe — macerated, illustrating the above. The original shaft has been attacked by disease, probably tubercular, and lies with its tissue expanded and partially absorbed within a newly-formed periosteal shell. This shell has several large apertures like irregular cloacse. G. C. 1438. Presented by John Campbell, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 226. Tubercular (?) Disease of Metatarsal Bone.—Left metatarsal bone of great toe—macerated, illustrating the above. '' The disease followed a general syphilitic (sic) affection in a young and apparently healthy man ; he had had also a cutaneous disease which was tedious and difficult of cure. The metatarsal hone was removed by the donor, and the toe preserved, but the wound did not heal during the man's stay in the Hospital, which was for many weeks. He had very considerable power in moving the great toe, and in a healthy subject little, or, indeed, no deformity, would have followed the operation." On the inner side of the base there is a deep excavation, the wall of which is formed of rarefied bone. The disease was considered to be syphilitic, but the diagnosis at that time (1828) may not have discriminated between syphilis and tuberculosis. G. C. 1115 Presented by John Campbell, F.R.C.S.E. 6.227. Tubercular Disease of Metatarsal Bone.—Plaster cast of a front part of a left foot, showing great swelling and ulceration over the inner metatarsal bones. The uniform swelling and the appearance of the ulcers are characteristic of the swellings of the soft parts in the neighbourhood of tubercular bone disease. F. P. C. 2891. 6. 228.

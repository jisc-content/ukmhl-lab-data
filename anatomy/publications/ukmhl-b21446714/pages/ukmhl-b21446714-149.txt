117 Fractures of the Femur. 3. 201. Ununited Extra-eapsular Fracture of the Neck.— Upper end of a left femur—macerated, showing the ahove. The neck of the bone has apparently given way nearer to the head than usual, but there has been the characteristic splitting of the great trochanter by impaction of the neck into it. Much new bone has been thrown out from the upper part of the shaft behind, below, and especially in front. The majority of the smaller fragments have united to one another and to the main piece only by fibrous tissue. The upper fragment, consisting of the head and part of the neck, has no new bone formed upon it, and its broken margin is quite sharp, except where it has been mechanically worn against the upper part of the shaft. Above this worn part the surface of the bone shows some superficial erosions, as if granulation tissue had been absorbing it. The want of formative power in this upper fragment is probably due to insufficient vascular supply, a condition which so often leads to non-union in the intra- capsular variety of fracture.

The patient survived the injury several years. During the patient's life there was difference of opinion among several surgeons as to the exact nature of the injury. The case was originally treated as one of fracture of the neck, but some afterwards held that it was an unreduced dislocation. Sir Charles Bell in consultation confirmed the diagnosis of fracture, and this view was verified at the post-mortem examination. The fracture has the usual characters as to the giving way of the neck and splitting of the trochanters. The fragments are united by firm fibrous tissue, and the leg has been considerably shortened and everted. B. C. r. 1. M. 20. .203.

Diseases of Bone. 290 tubercular granulations. Probably this has been primarily a case of tubercular disease of the knee-joint, in which an abscess has burst, and turned septic, causing a secondary septic suppuration of the limb, and leading to this periosteal outgrowth on the femur- B. C. i. 5. M. 49. 6. 232. Tubercular and Septic Disease of the Tibia.—Left tibia—macerated, illustrating the above. The upper half is very irregular, partly from new bone formation on the surface, especially at the back and on the sides lower down, and partly from erosion and opening out of the bone. The latter change is best seen on the inner tuberosity and at the back of the articular surface. This may have begun as tubercular disease of the head of the tibia which became septic. B. C. i. 5. M. 19. 6. 233. Tubercular and Septic Disease of the Femur and Tibia.—Part of femur, tibia, and fibula for about six inches above and below knee-joint—macerated, illustrating the above. The femur is greatly thickened, and its surface is irregular. The lower articular surfaces are eroded and absorbed in front, and posteriorly are covered by irregular deposits of bone. The cancellated tissue above the articular surface is irregularly hollowed out, and what remains has been rarefied. The shaft of the bone is considerably thickened, and near the upper end shows a periosteal crust, like that due to septic inflammation. Below this, however, the new bone is irregularly absorbed and eaten into, as if by tubercular granulations. The articular surface of the tibia is more complete, although in front it shows considerable depression and excavation as if from tuber- culosis. The shaft of the tibia is greatly thickened and con- densed, and shows irregular new bone formation on the surface. This also has been attacked, but to a less extent than in the

508 Diseases of Joints. Anchylosis from conditions, the nature of which is obscure. 7.203. Anchylosis of the Astpag-alo-ealearcean Joint.— Section of the astragalus and os calcis of a young person—in spirit. The excision of the ankle-joint had been ineffectively performed, and amputation became necessary. The cartilaginous surface of the astragalus and os calcis are adherent. There has been no inflammation in this joint, and there is no sign of granulation tissue. G. C. 2842. Presented by Professor T. Annandale. 7. 204. Anchylosis of the Upper End of the Tibia and Fibula.—Right tibia and fibula—macerated, and showing the above. The upper ends of the bones are united by a bridge of new bone fusing them together. The vascular pores on both bones are somewhat larger than usual, but there is no sign of disease. This specimen resembles those of anchylosis in multiple exostosis (6. 377), and may be an allied condition. B. C. 2. M. 33. IV. NEW GROWTHS INVOLVING JOINTS. 7..205. Osteo-Sareoma of the Head of the Tibia.—Upper ends of a left tibia and fibula — macerated, illustrating the above. This specimen is referred to by Dr James Russell in bis chapter on "Uncommon Disease," in his treatise upon " TheKnee-joint." Although the particulars of this case were not detailed, the symptoms described in a general way were those of a rapidly increasing sarcoma of the bones form- ing the joint. The original texture of the head of the tibia is greatly altered, being in many places absorbed, while what remains is irregularly eroded and rarefied, so as to resemble the effects of a severe septic inflammation. All round the upper end, where

44 Injuries of Bone. fracture of the left parietal bone. The specimen has become contracted in drying. The ruptured part of the dura mater corresponds only with the portion of the fissure within the vault, a part not shown in the previous specimen. G. C. 2848. Presented by P. H. Maclauen, F.R.C.S.E. 3.13. Brain injured by Fracture of the Skull.—Brain from the patient from whom the two previous specimens were taken. There has been injury of the parietal lobe under the rupture in the dura mater, but there is still more extensive laceration at the base. The under surfaces of the left temporo- sphenoidal and of both frontal lobes have been severely lacerated. Possibly the injury to the frontal lobes may have been associated with injury of the right occipital region, but the injury to the left temporo-sphenoidal lobe is not what would have been expected from an injury to the parietal bone on the same side. See No. 3.5. G. C. 2846. Presented by P. H. Maclaren, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 14. Fracture of the Base of the Skull.—Posterior part of the base of a skull—macerated—showing a longitudinal fracture at the base. The left petrous portion of the temporal bone has been broken off, and there are extensive fissures in the posterior fossa, especially on the left side. On the right side a fissure running along the upper surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone has entered the roof of the tympanum. P. P. C. 29. 3. 15. Fracture of the Base of the Skull.—Posterior part of the base of a skull—macerated. In the right cerebellar fossa, close to the foramen magnum, there are three short fissures parallel to one another.

Syphilitic Enlargement. 323 6. 309. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Femur.— Right femur —macerated, illustrating the above. The bone is heavy, and the surface shows at various places diffused thickenings, with marks of increased vascularity. The neck is short, and the head, owing to absorption, is below the level of the trochanter. The margins of the articular surface are prolonged and overhang the neck—changes often seen in arthritis deformans. Sir Charles Bell notes: "The sinking of the head of the bone and distortion of the neck have been consequent on disease. An appearance is presented in the specimen which has been described by some as a reunited fracture within the capsular ligament." Probably syphilis has altered the shaft, and arthritis deformans the upper end. B. C. i. 1. M. 22. a. 6. 310. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia. Eight tibia of an adult, from the same syphilitic subject as that from which Nos. 6. 306 and 6. 307 were taken—macerated, illustrating the above. There is an enlargement on the outer surface, three or four inches from the lower end, and a periosteal crust extends on the shin surface as high as the upper third. An elongated patch of new periosteal bone is seen on the outer surface, at the attachment of the tibialis anticus. The bone is some- what increased in weight. B. c. i. 5. M. 53 11. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia.—Left tibia, from the same subject as the last—macerated, illustrating the above. There are periosteal crusts on the shin surface, and also at the upper part of the outer and posterior surfaces. The bone is also somewhat increased in weight. R C. i. 5. M. 55.

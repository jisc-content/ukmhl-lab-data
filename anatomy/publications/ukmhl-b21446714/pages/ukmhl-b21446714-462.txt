Diseases of Joints. 430 End of Tibia.—Lower end of a left tibia—macerated, illus- trating the above. There has been rarefactive ostitis of the back and inner parts of the lower end, and the cancellous tissue is exposed below part of the articular surface. A considerable crust of new periosteal bone extends up the shaft on the inner and posterior aspects. B. C. n. M. 58. 7.13. Septic Inflammation in Ankle-j oint, following- Inj ury. Lower end of a left tibia—macerated, illustrating the above. The patient had fallen from a great height and so alighted on the ground as to injure his ankle-joint. The leg was amputated some time after the accident for what was supposed to be a scrofulous affection of the ankle-joint, but which has probably been suppuration owing to the septic disease of the bone. The lower end of the tibia has evidently been split vertically into an anterior and posterior portion. The latter, carrying the malleolus, is on a higher level than the former, and there is a fissure between them. A portion of the original articular surface remaining on the anterior fragment has evidently necrosed, and has been in process of separation, for it only remains attached now by a small stem on the inner side. The rest of the articular surface is carious. The surface of the lower end, especially at the back, is covered with irregular newly- formed nodules. B. C. n. M. 38. 7. 14. Septic Inflammation of the Elbow, following Com- pound Fracture of the Olecranon.—Bones forming the left elbow of an adult—cleaned and mounted in spirit, illustrat- ing the above. From a patient whose arm was amputated three weeks after receiv- ing a compound fracture of the olecranon.' The cartilage on the trochlear surface of the humerus is almost enirely destroyed, and is represented by only a few loose tagts. The cartilaginous surface of the capitellum is deficient at the edge. The olecranon process is wanting, and

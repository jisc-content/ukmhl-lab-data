431 Suppurative Arthritis. the remainder of the ulnar articular cartilage has at some places disappeared, while at others it hangs loose. The margin of the articular cartilage of the radius has heen lost, and the cartilage on the cup-shaped depression is partly detached. The bone from which the cartilage has disappeared is covered by granulations—now altered by the spirit. G. C. 1251. 7.15, Septic Inflammation of the Elbow-joint, probably after Injury.—Upper end of a left ulna, olecranon wanting —macerated, illustrating the above. The articular surface is scarcely recognisable from its toughness and irregularity. Much new bone has been thrown out upon the inner and posterior aspects of the upper end and for some way down the shaft. In this case septic inflammation has probably followed compound fracture of the olecranon. B. C. i. M. 55. * KNEE-JOINT. 2. Where the Inflammation has been caused by Tuberculosis, a. Changes primarily in synovial membrane. 7. 16. Tubercular Synovitis.—Glycerine and gelatine cast of parts removed in an excision of the knee. The cast shows a mass of pulpy, cedematous, synovial membrane round the patella, encroaching on the-margin of the cartilage. Similar characteristics are seen round the upper end of the tibia, where the two semi-lunar cartilages were covered by gelatinous material. On the femur the growth of the vascular synovial membrane between the surface for the patella and that for the tibia has separated the joint into two, one cavity above and one below the ligamentum mucosum and the ligamentum alaria.

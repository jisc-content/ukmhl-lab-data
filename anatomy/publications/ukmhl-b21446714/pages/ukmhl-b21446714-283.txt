251 Necrosis from Pus-forming Organisms. Another smooth necrosed patch is seen in front of the small trochanter, and is evidently portion of a large and deep necrosis. Before the fracture this has apparently been continuous with the lower necrosed piece. Some new bone has been thrown out on the front of the shaft, and also behind for a few inches below the seat of fracture. The cancellated tissue at the upper and lower ends of the bone, especially near the necrosed portion, has been rarefied, and is a good illustration of what has been already noted as septic caries. (See Nos. 6.82 to 6.87.) B. C. r. 1. M. 24. 114. Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis of the Femur. —Left femur of a young person—soft parts cleaned off and in spirit, to show the above. There is a fracture about the middle of the bone, which may have been a compound one, and therefore possibly the starting-point of the disease. A large portion of the whole thickness of the shaft below the fracture is smooth, and evidently has necrosed. It has been in process of separation from the bone below. Above the fracture, for some distance, there has been some periosteal new growth. Just below the level of the small trochanter the bone has been entirely destroyed. Loose fragments of necrosed bone are seen here and there at the upper end of the shaft. The substance of the bone above this- point has been softened and partially absorbed, and has been separated into distinct pieces, some evidently necrotic. The whole bone, with the exception of the lower epiphysis, seem* to have been affected. This specimen, like the last, illustrates what might be called septic caries and septic necrosis. If it were certain that the disease in this case had resulted from a compound fracture, this specimen would have been placed in group B, i.e. among those in which pus-forming, organisms have attacked the bones through wounds.

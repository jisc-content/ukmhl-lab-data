491 Arthritis Deformans of Hip-joint. left hip-joint of an elderly person—the femur sawn vertically— macerated, illustrating the ahove. The head of the femur is enlarged, chiefly hy a new bone formation at the margins, which extends to the neck. The upper part of the head is smooth and shining, and, except that it is porous in places, might pass for a portion of a billiard ball. The surface of the new bone on the front of the neck and upper part of the shaft is porous and irregular. The interior of the bone shows condensation at the centre of the head, with some empty spaces near the articular margin. The cavity of tbe acetabulum is somewhat shallow, and the bottom is entirely filled up with new bone. The articular surface is somewhat porous above, but shows a band of eburnation all round. The cotyloid margin is irregidarly prolonged, and some rough new bone has been formed all round and beyond it. The capsular ligament is said to have had bony excrescences attached to it. G. C. 1481.

Advanced Arthritis Deformans, with Locking".— Bones forming the right hip-joint of an elderly person, in which the head of the femur is locked within the acetabulum— macerated. There is some irregular enlargement at the articular margin of the head of the femur. The lesser trochanter has been entirely worn away against a piece of the bone, which pro- jects from just below the acetabulum, and the adjacent surfaces are adapted to one another. The hip-joint has been fixed in a strongly adducted position. The margin of the acetabulum is deepened, and has grown inwards so as to envelop the head of the femur. A slight range of movement is possible between the femur and the acetabulum, but it is doubtful whether this existed before maceration. There is a small semi-detached scale of bone, with a depression near it in the cavity of the ilium, the nature of which is obscure.

Preface,. ix Synovial Sheaths, Bursas, and Fasciae, and Connective Tissue; and (3) " the Limbs as a whole." The specimens thus included have been formed into ten Series (see general Analysis). The Series are numbered consecutively throughout the divisions of the first Class, and it is intended to carry on the numbers of the succeeding Series continuously through the Classes and Divi- sions which have yet to follow. Within each Series, however, the numbers of the individual Specimens begin anew. In the Bell Collection, a Series of specimens illustrating the normal structure of each organ preceded those illustrating its abnormal conditions. This method was discarded when the previous Catalogue was drawn up, but has now been re - adopted. The same principle has moreover been carried out among the individual Pathological specimens, where a still closer proximity of the normal and abnormal seemed advantageous. Nothing need be said about the mode of subdividing the first five Series, but of that employed in the sixth—"Diseases of Bone"—some explanation seems advisable, especially as, with certain modifications, it has been applied to the Series which follow. Under the general title " Diseases of Bone " four main groups have been recognised, i.e. I. Abnormalities in growth or development, which are chiefly, of course, congenital; II. Altera- tions due to local or general affections of Nutrition; III. Inflammatory Diseases; and IV. Tumours or New Growths. The subdivisions of the first and second of these groups may be sufficiently studied in the General Analysis; but of those of the third group—i.e., Inflammations—a short explanation may not be out of place. The view of Inflammation which

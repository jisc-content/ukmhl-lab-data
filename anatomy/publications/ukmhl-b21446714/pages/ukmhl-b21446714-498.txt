4G6 I Diseases of Joints. There is a large cavity in the neck and great trochanter, and it extends also into the head. The walls of the cavity are partly formed by fibrous tissue, but at the lower, and upper and inner ends there are remains of a caseous extension. At the latter place the disease has penetrated into the upper part of the head. The cartilaginous surface is apparently unchanged. This has probably been a case where the bone disease has led chiefly to external abscesses, with secondary and late implication of the joint. G- C. 2014. 7. 103. Tubercular Arthritis, chiefly involving the Aceta- bulum.—Bones forming the left hip-joint of a growing person —macerated, illustrating the above. The cavity of the acetabulum is enlarged, and in several places is perforated. Two portions of bone have been necrotic and in process of separation — one at the junction of the iliac and pubic, and the other, a larger piece, at the junction of the iliac and ischial portions of the acetabulum. The rest of the acetabular surface is rarefied and eroded where it is not perforated. The articular surface of the head of the femur is also rarefied and rough, and the texture of the neck is lightened. The angle between the neck and the shaft is in- creased, a change often seen in femora of young, bed-ridden patients. G. C. 1 7. 104. Tubercular Arthritis, chiefly involving Aceta- bulum.—Left innominate bone and upper end of the femur —macerated, illustrating the above. The upper part of the acetabulum is very irregular, and at one spot is perforated by an aperture a quarter of an inch in diameter. A large piece of bone at the top is necrotic, and has been in process of separation, and similar pieces have no doubt dropped out from the gaps in the neighbourhood. The

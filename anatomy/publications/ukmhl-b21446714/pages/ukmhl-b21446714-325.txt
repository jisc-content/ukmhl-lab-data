Syphilitic ' Caries.' 293 extensive changes on the inside. On the outside the parietal bones near the vertex are roughened, chiefly by the enlargement of the vascular pores. On the frontal bone there is also rough- ening, not only by enlargement of vascular pores, but by numerous small grooves on the surface, probably for blood- vessels. On the inside the roughness is chiefly due to new bone formation round small vascular channels, although the pores for entering vessels are enlarged also. The roughness is most marked on the frontal bone, and especially near the middle line. At two places the surface of the inner table is left exposed, and is surrounded by ragged bony spicules of newly-formed bone. Possibly at these places there have been gummatous deposits between the bone and dura mater. B. C. r. 7. M. 8. 239. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.-Skull-cap of an aged person—macerated, illustrating the above. The bone is roughened over both inner and outer aspects. Ihe outside shows remains of its original smoothness at one or two places only, i.e. near the right frontal eminence, at the temporal ridges, and near the anterior and inferior angle of the nght parietal bone. The roughness is due partly to the opening out of vascular channels and partly to shallow depressions of he surface, which are most marked at the back and on the eft sxde of the vertex. At the back of each parietal bone there is a smooth patch entrenched round by a groove, as if necros1S and the process of separation had already be<mn Inside, the roughness is very marked on the left side, especially at the site of the coronal suture, but is not quite so extensive on the tight side of the middle line. The roughness is mostly due to the development of new bone, but also to the eating out of both the old and the new bone. Erosion and new formation must have gone on side by side. Small apertures are present near the middle of the coronal suture, and at other P'-ices. _ _ • ■ . B. C. i. 7. M. 10.

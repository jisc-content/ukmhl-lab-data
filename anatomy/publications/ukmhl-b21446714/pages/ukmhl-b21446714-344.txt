Syphilitic Disease of the Skull—healed afterLoss Of Substance.—Skull-cap—macerated, illustrating the above. The anterior part of the frontal bone shows two large irregular depressions of the surface; one is on the right side, and°is deeper, larger, and more irregular than the other, which extends from the middle line to the left frontal eminence. Except where the two depressions are contiguous, their margins are slightly but distinctly raised. On the left side this raised margin shows grooves and pores for numerous blood- vessels, as if the process had been in progress, while on the right side the surface of the raised part has been smoothed over A small hole in the base of the right depression com- municates with the interior. The cerebral surface shows marks of increased vascularity on the parietal and frontal bones. The section of the frontal bone is increased in thickness. At other places, although the bone is not thickened, the diploe is P ' , F. P. C. 476. condensed. Presented by Professor Russell. 6. 278. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull-healed after Separ- ation Of a large Sequestrum.-Anterior portion of the right half of a calvarium and roof of orbit-macerated, illustrating During life a fungus cerebri projected through the aperture left by the separation of a large sequestrum. The aperture is irregularly circular, and measures two inches by three and a half inches in diameter. Its margins are Wed off, as if the disease had subsided^! the pjrt. had been healing.

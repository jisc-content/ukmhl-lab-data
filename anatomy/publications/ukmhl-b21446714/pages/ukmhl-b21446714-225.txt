Dislocations of the Shoulder. 193 There is an unreduced sub-coracoid dislocation of the humerus, and the edge of the glenoid cavity has caused a ■depression upon the back of the anatomical neck. This part of the bone is elongated, so that the neck of this humerus almost resembles that of a femur. These changes may have been pro- duced by a splitting of the great tuberosity against the edge of the glenoid cavity at the time of the accident, and afterwards by absorption from pressure and some new formation. (See paper by Caird, "Edinburgh Medical Journal," 1886.) The original glenoid cavity is partially filled up, and an imperfect new one has been formed below the coracoid process. G. C. 3468. Presented by Professor Struthers, January 1893. 5. 6. Double Sub-coracoid Dislocation of the Shoulder.— Plaster of Paris cast of the front of the chest and shoulders' of an adult, showing the above. The dislocation on the right side was recent, that on the left side was old-standing. It may be noted that the unreduced dislocations, Nos. 5. 3 and 5. 4 were also from one person. G.

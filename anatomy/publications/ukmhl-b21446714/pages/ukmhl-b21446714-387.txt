Osseous Tumours. 355 B. C. 1. 6. M. 19. 6. 380. Exostoses of the Scapula.—Eight scapula—macerated, illustrating the above. The main projection is from the sub-scapular fossa ; others arise from the infra-spinatus fossa and at the superior angle. They are like ossifications in the corresponding muscles. B. C. 1. 6. M. 16. 6.381. Exostoses of Humerus.—Right humerus—macerated, illustrating the above. A long irregular piece of bone projects forwards in the position of the bicipital groove, which it has replaced. Another irregular piece projects inwards about three inches below the head, and several smaller projections are seen on the back of the bone just below the surgical neck. The deltoid impression is also somewhat prominent. The head of the bone and the tuberosities are small and ill-formed, and the muscular impressions are comparatively faint. The articular surface has lost its smoothness. This appearance of the head and tuber- osities makes it probable that the shoulder-joint had been disused for many years. The lower end of the bone seems normal. This bone may have belonged to the same patient as the previous scapula, but there is no history to that effect. B, C. 1. 6. M. 17. 6. 382. Exostosis Of Humerus.-Left hunierus-nracerated, illustrating the above. A large and somewhat nodular mass of bone projects back- wards and outwards from the upper half of the shaft This long outgrowth is for the most part in the position of the outer head of the triceps, or between that and the deltoid. The muscular impressions on the upper end are fairly well marked.

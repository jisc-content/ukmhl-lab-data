Anchylosis after Tuberculosis of Knee. 45 The knee-joint has been fixed at a right angle. The patella is anchylosed to the front of the outer condyle, the back of which is sunk into and partially anchylosed to the outer tuberosity of the tibia. The inner condyle is separated from the inner tuberosity by about half an inch. No new periosteal bone has been formed. The substance of the bones is very greasy. Sir Charles Bell states that "this kind of distortion is owing to the patient's twisting his leg round the crutch." B. C. ii. M. 28. 7. 85. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Bones of a left knee-joint—macerated, and showing anchylosis in the flexed position. Tbe patella, which is anchylosed to the under surface of the outer condyle, has had an imperfect false joint between its lower edge and the front of the inner tuberosity of the tibia. The back of the inner condyle of the femur is adherent to the inner tuberosity of the tibia, the line of junction being irregular, and having been formed chiefly of fibrous tissue, now for the most part macerated away. The outer condyle of the femur has not been in contact with the corresponding tuberosity of the tibia, which, however, has been greatly absorbed. The tibia has been pulled backwards and rotated out- wards upon its inner tuberosity, so that the outer tuberosity is proportionately more dislocated than the inner. The bones are light and greasy. Active disease seems to have entirely ceased. G. C. 1003. 7. 86. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Bones of a left knee-joint—macerated, showing anchylosis in the flexed position and distortion.

Diseases of Bone. 394 "5th.—M.r Allan to-day amputated the leg five inches below the knee, by the circular operation. Nothing ixncommon occurred ; and few vessels required to be tied. The patient bore it without expressing much pain. " 28th.—Dismissed in progress of cure." This specimen shows that the tibia and fibula have been enlarged, as is usual, from their being in the neighbourhood of a chronic ulcer, but the destruction of the tibia is special, and is due to the inroads of epithelioma. G. C. 983. 6. 468. Epithelioma penetrating- and eroding- the Tibia.- Lower two-thirds of a left tibia and fibula—macerated, illustrat- ing the above. Both bones show the typical enlargement associated with chronic ulceration, with, in addition, an area of destruction on the tibia, doubtless due to epithelioma. This has evidently been a case of chronic ulcer, upon which epithelioma has supervened. C. G. 21. 6. 469. Epithelioma penetrating and eroding the Tibia- Portion of a tibia—macerated, illustrating the above. The substance of the bone is much eroded, at one place almost eaten through, while above and below the deficiency the bone has been thickened. This has apparently been another case of chronic ulcer, followed by epithelioma, which has in- vaded the bone. B- C- r- 5- M- 1S- 6. 470. Epithelioma invading the Tibia.—Portion of a right leg—in spirit, illustrating the above. "The leg was amputated above the knee, but the disease returned in the stump, and the man died." This specimen shows that at some parts the ulcer has had normal granulations, while at others there are great irregularities

475 Regeneration of Os Galcis. The bones are light, and their texture partially absorbed, the head of the astragalus and the base of one of the metatarsal bones being chiefly affected. A crust of new bone has been thrown out on the tibia and fibula. G. C. 936. Referred to in Sir George Ballingall's Clin. Lect, Nov. 2, p. 11. Presented by Sir George Ballingall. 127. Tubercular Disease in a Regenerated Os Caleis.— Section of the left foot of a boy, aged 14—in spirit, illustrating the above. Dr Joseph Bell excised the os ealcis for tubercular disease. The bone was completely regenerated, but two years afterwards the patient presented himself again with a return of the disease in the upper portion of the new os calcis. The foot was therefore amputated. A considerable part of the back of the os calcis has been tunnelled by tubercular granulations, now blanched by the sPirit- G. C. 2665. Presented by Joseph Bell, F.R.C.S.E. 128. Regeneration of the Os Caleis after Excision.— Plaster cast of the outer half of the right foot of a young man —a different case from the last, illustrating the above. Several years before the cast was taken, Dr Joseph Bell excised the os calcis for tubercular disease, leaving the periosteum. The bone was re-formed so as to maintain the shape of the heel, and the depressed scar was the only abnormal appearance to be detected. G. C. 3532. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E. 129.

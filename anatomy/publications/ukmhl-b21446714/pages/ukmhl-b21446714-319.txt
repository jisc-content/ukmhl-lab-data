287 Tubercular Necrosis. 6. 225. Tubercular Necrosis and Enlargement of Meta- First Metacarpal Bone.—Part of the metacarpal bone of a woman—macerated, illustrating the above. It was removed by operation. Tbere is an imperfectly formed new shell, with a hollow interior, from which sequestra have probably been removed. G. C. 995. 6. 222. Tubercular Necrosis and Enlargement of Meta- carpal Bone and First Phalanx.—Part of metacarpal bone and phalanges of a finger—periosteum removed, and in spirit. There is lateral enlargement of the first phalanx, with loss of substance near the base, probably from necrosis. The distal end of the metacarpal bone is enlarged. G. C. 566. Presented by Sir George Ballingall. 6. 223. Tubercular (?) Necrosis and Enlargement of Meta- carpal Bones.—Two metacarpal bones—macerated, illus- trating the above. There has been extensive new formation on the surface, with a partial re-absorption of the same. A sequestrum is seen in the interior of the more eroded of the two. Septic mischief has probably complicated this case. W. C. G. 11. 6. 224. Tubercular Disease of Metacarpal Bone.—Plaster cast of right hand, with thumb broken off, illustrating the above. A large swelling has accompanied tubercular disease of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. On the swollen part an ulcer is shown, which, no doubt, communicated with the bone. F. P. C. 2887.

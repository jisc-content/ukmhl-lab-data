576 The Limbs as a Whole, 11. 16. Congenital Hypertrophy of Finger.—Cast in glycerine and gelatine of a baby's hand and forearm, illustrating the above. The finger had been unusually large at birth, and had afterwards increased still more out of proportion to the others. It was amputated by Dr Joseph Bell the day after the cast was made. The finger is about one-third longer and three or four times thicker than the others. The end of the finger is about the same girth as the infant's wrist. G. C. 2731. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1884. Lower Limb, a. From deficiency in development. 11. 17. Congenital Absence of the Lower Half of the Tibia.—Right lower limb of a newly born infant, dissected from the thigh downwards, showing the condition of the structures accompanying the above malformation—in spirit. The child was born at full term. The parents were healthy and without any history of malformation on either side. The child died of atelectasis, twelve hours after birth. The tibia is apparently well formed at the knee-joint, but half-way down it tapers to a fine point, which had partly pro- jected through the skin. The fibula is unusually strong, and is bent inwards near its lower end. The foot is displaced inwards, as in talipes varus, and the astragalus articulates with the side of the lower end of the fibula. The muscles are fairly well developed. G. C. 2504. Presented by William Craig, F.R.C.S.E., 1878. (For full description of the dissection, vide the account of the case by Dr Craig in The Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. xii. 1878.) 11. 18. Congenital Absence of the Tibia.—Lower end of the femur with the patella and leg of a young child dissected and in spirit, illustrating the above.

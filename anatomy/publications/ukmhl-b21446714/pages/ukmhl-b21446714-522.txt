Advancing Arthritis Deformans.—Right hip-joint of an elderly person, in spirit, with the muscles and ligaments dissected off—illustrating the above. The cartilage at the upper and anterior part of the head has been replaced by smooth bone. Elsewhere the place of the cartilage is taken up by a vascular substance, which has been ossifying, and has at many places, especially at the margin, developed irregular pieces of new bone. Some new bone has also been thrown out on the neck, especially along the front and at the top. G. C. 1120. Presented by Robert Knox, F.R.C.S.E. 7.169. Advanced Arthritis Deformans.—Bones forming the right hip-joint of an elderly person—macerated, showing con- siderable changes on the articular surfaces. The head of the femur is enlarged, chiefly by the develop- ment of new bone on and round the margins of the articular surface. The central portion of the head of the bone has lost the usual depression for the ligamentum teres, and is smooth and eburnated, although somewhat porous in one or two places. The development of new bone extends on to the neck, especially in front. The cavity of the acetabulum is shallow, partly by enlargement at the upper side, and partly by filling in at the bottom, where the usual deficiency at the attachment of the ligamentum teres has been bridged over. The upper part is smooth and partly eburnated. There has been an irregular deposit of new bone around the cotyloid margin. G. C. 1230. 7. 170. Advanced Arthritis Deformans.—Bones forming

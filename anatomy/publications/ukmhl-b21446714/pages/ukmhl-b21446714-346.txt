314 Diseases of Bone. The face has been destroyed, and the orbits, mouth, and nose are thrown into one common gap. From the appearance of the face and the indeBniteness of former nomenclature, it seems right to classify this as syphilis. B. C. i. 6. M. 39. B. The Skeleton, f. Where the chief changes are in the form of enlargement. 6. 282. Syphilitic Disease of Skeleton.â€”Male skeleton, want- ing the skull, illustrating the above. The vertebra show an increased vascularity on the bodies and laminae. The ribs are not appreciably altered. The clavicles show enlarged pores for blood-vessels, but nothing that is characteristic. On the scapulae the posterior part of the spines, especially the left, is somewhat thick and irregular, but otherwise there is no appreciable change. The right humerus is considerably thickened at its lower end by periosteal new bone formation, most marked in front. There the surface, besides being irregular, is in places eroded as if the new material were being absorbed again. The periosteal crust diminishes from below upwards, and does not quite reach the deltoid attachment on the outer side, although it can be traced further up on the back. The rest of the bone shows only an enlargement of vascular pores. The left humerus has only a very slight periosteal crust, about the middle of the posterior surface. Elsewhere the surface of the bone is rough from enlargement of the vascular pores. The right ulna shows only some periosteal crusts on the outer side of the upper end, and enlargement of vascular pores at other places, but the left ulna shows a very distinct thickening all round the shaft, about the middle. The changes at the upper end correspond to those on the ri-ht side. The radii show an increased size of vascular apertures and some periosteal new bone formation on the upper part of the outer surface. On the right side, in addition, there

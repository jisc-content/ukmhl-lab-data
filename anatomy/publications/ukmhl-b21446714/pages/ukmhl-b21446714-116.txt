Injuries of Bone. 84 humerus, broken off irregularly from the shaft of the bone- macerated. The patient, John Locke, ret. 64, fell over a parapet at Stockbridge, and besides this injury sustained a compound fracture of the elbow joint. The arm was amputated at the shoulder joint a few hours after the accident by Sir George Ballingall, and the patient recovered without a bad symptom. The fracture has passed between the anatomical and sur- gical necks on the outer side, and through the anatomical neck on the inner side of the bone, i.e. in a line corresponding to that of the epiphysial junction in a young subject. The rari- fication of bone round the seat of fracture makes it appear as if the patient had survived the injury for some weeks, and as if this piece had had a vascular supply. G. C. 744. Presented by Sir Geoege Ballingall. 3. 107. Fracture through the Anatomical Neck and greater Tuberosity.—Left humerus—macerated—showing the above injury. The fracture, as in the previous specimen, has passed between the anatomical and surgical necks on the outer side, and through the anatomical neck on the inner side of the bone. There has been no union, but there are indications of periostitis on the upper piece at the outside, and on the lower fragment down nearly to the elbow joint. The patient had therefore probably survived the injury several weeks. G. C. 918. Presented by Sir George Ballingall. 3. 108. United Fracture through the Anatomical Neck and greater Tuberosity.—Left humerus of an adult, probably a woman—macerated—showing the above. The line of fracture has evidently been similar to that in the last two specimens, i.e., between the two necks on the outer side, and along the line of the anatomical neck on the inner side. The broken bone has united without thickeuing, but

418 Diseases of Bone. c. Changes associated with alterations in the Nervous System. (1.) Hydrocephalus. 6. 529. Hydrocephalic Skull-Cap.—Skull-cap apparently of a young person—macerated, illustrating the above. It is of an unusually large size, but very thin. The sutures are still partly occupied by membrane. The inner surfaces of the frontal and lower part of the parietal bones are distinctly marked by cerebral convolutions. The divergent arrangement of the osseous spicula, and their mutual insertion at the sutures, are well seen. F. P. C. 625. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 6. 530. Hydrocephalic Skull.—Greater part of the skull of a child—macerated, illustrating the above. The bones of the skull are very thin and bulged out, especially in the frontal and parietal regions. The anterior fontanelle is still open. The other fontanelles and the sutures have closed, although they are, of course, still unossified. F. P. C. 626. 6. 531. Skeleton showing- Hydrocephalus and Spina bifida.—Skeleton of an infant—macerated, illustrating the above. The skull is a remarkably fine specimen of the effects of hydrocephalus. The distension has drawn the skull into a more- or less hemispherical shape, smaller however at the base, where the ossification has been most complete. The change is well seen in the frontal bones, where the orbital plates having been pulled upwards, and the frontal bones thrust outwards, the two- have come to form part of a continuous sweep. The upper part of the child's head has been entirely membranous, and large spaces intervene between the parietal bones and those with which they should articulate, as well as between the upper

Tubercular Arthritis subsiding. 455 7.75. Tubercular Arthritis, with great Loss of Bone, subsiding".—Bones forming the left knee-joint of an adult —macerated, illustrating the above. In the femur a portion of the articular surface below each condyle exactly fits the articular surfaces on the tibia, and is comparatively unchanged. In front of this the arti- cular surface on each condyle is deficient, and on the outside it is deeply eroded. Above the articular surface there is a circular aperture about an inch in diameter, leading to a large cavity within the bone, opening posteriorly. A thin crust of new periosteal bone has been formed on the surface for three or four inches above the lower end. On the outer tuberosity of the tibia the articular surface is unusually concave, and projects above the surrounding bone, but it is not eroded. The articular surface on the inner tuberosity is of a similar shape, but in addition both it and the surrounding bone have been eroded and excavated by tubercular granulations. There is also a roughening by periosteal deposit of the sides of the inner tuberosity. This has been a case where the interior of the lower end of the femur has been greatly affected although there has also been anchylosis of the joint in the straight position. G. C. 374. 7.76. Tubercular Synovitis tending- to Anchylosis.— Knee-joint laid open from the front, apparently by forcible flexion—in spirit, illustrating the above. The articular surfaces of the femur and tibia have been partially anchylosed by developing granulations, while the patella has been drawn right up. The skin over the front of the knee is extensively cicatrised. This was entered in the MS. Catalogue as a "scrofulous knee-joint." It may, however, have been a case of excision, followed by amputation. G. C. 2451. 7. 77. Tubercular (?) Arthritis, partially cured, but with

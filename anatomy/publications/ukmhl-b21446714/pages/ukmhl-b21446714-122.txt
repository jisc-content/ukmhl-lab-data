90 Injuries of Bone. across the olecranon and coronoid fossae, and has terminated about half an inch above the outer condyle. G. C. 3092. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E. • FRACTURES OF THE RADIUS AND ULNA. 3. 127. Badly United Fracture of the Radius and Ulna. Left radius and ulna of a young person—macerated—show- ing the above. The bones have been united at a considerable angle, and there is callous thickening round the seat of fracture, especially on the radius. The epiphyseal lines are apparent at the lower end of both bones on the dorsal aspect. This has probably been a fracture of the radius and a green- stick fracture of the ulna. F- P. C. 74. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 3. 128. Fracture of the Bones of the forearm, Radius ununited.—Bones of the right forearm of an adult macerated. The ulna, fractured a little below the middle, is united in bad position. The lower fragment is displaced inwards from the tipper, and is somewhat rotated inwards on its own axis. The head and styloid processes are greatly altered, apparently by arthritis deformans. The radius has an ununited fracture about the middle. The broken ends are enlarged and irregular, and their contiguous surfaces are rough. At the lower end the radius has been broken about half an inch above the articular surface, and the lower fragment has been displaced outwards and backwards, but without much rotation backwards. The styloid process has, however, thus been raised above the level of that of the ulna.. This iniurv might be called a form of Colles' fracture. J G. C. 3449. Presented by Macdonald Brown, F.R.C.S.E.

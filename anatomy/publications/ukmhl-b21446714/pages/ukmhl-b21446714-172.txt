140 Injuries of Bone. for the most part covered with lymph. At some places the compact tissue at the seat of fracture is smooth and bare. G. C. 312. Presented by Dr Maclagan and J. W. Tukner, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 268. Uniting badly-set Fracture of the Tibia and Fibula.—Portions of the shafts of the tibia and fibula, with the muscles dissected off—in spirit, showing the above. The upper fragment of the tibia is uniting to the lower fragment of the fibula, and the other fragments of each bone are free. The medullary cavities, where exposed, have been covered in, apparently as yet by soft material. The opposed fragments of the tibia and fibula have, however, been united by spongy bone, a slight crust of which is also seen on the adjacent tibia.

The limb was injected, the- bone cleaned, and put into weak acid, then dried and placed in turpentine. The fibula, near the lower end, has an indistinct fissure, and shows considerable enlargement and bony growth on the surface, as if this part had lain beneath an ulcer. The tibia has been irregularly broken about four inches above the ankle-joint, and the uniting medium is more vascular than the surrounding bone. The internal malleolus appears to have been broken off, and to. have re-united. B. C. L 1 M. 43. 3. 270. United Oblique Fracture of the Shaft of the Tibia.-Section of the lower half of a right tibia—macerated,, showing the above.

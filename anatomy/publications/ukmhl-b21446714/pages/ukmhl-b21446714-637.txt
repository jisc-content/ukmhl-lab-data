Stumps after Amputation. 605 103. Stump of an Amputation through the First Phalanx Of the Finger.—Gelatine and glycerine cast of the foregoing hand in the flexed position. This cast shows that the stump of the first phalanx flexed equally with the other fingers. G. C. 2897. Presented by Chakles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1888. 104. Stump after Chopart's Amputation.—Plaster of Paris cast of a stump of a right foot, after the above operation. The cast shows that the heel has not been drawn up, and that the sole has been planted well on the ground. The arch of the foot has necessarily given way, but an admirable basis of support has been left, much better than that afforded by Syme's amputation. G. C. 3527. Presented by Chakles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1893. PRINTED AT THE EDINBURGH PRESS, 9 AND 11 YOUNG STREET.

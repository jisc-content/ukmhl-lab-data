356 Diseases of Bone. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S. 6.383. Exostosis Of Humerus.—Left humerus—macerated, illustrating the above. Opposite the attachment of the deltoid a projection of bone rises from the inner side, somewhat abruptly below, but more- gradually above, when it passes into the line of the neck. The whole bone is curved inwards. The muscular impressions on the tuberosities are faint, and the articular surface of the head is slightly roughened, as if the shoulder-joint had been anchy- losed?

Exostosis of Ulna and Anchylosis to Radius, Which is distorted.-Eight radius and ulna of " a Dutch dwarf "—macerated, illustrating the above. The lower end of the ulna has been greatly expanded and has- become fused with the radius. A section of the expanded part shows that it is occupied by numerous irregular partitions. The outer surface is nodular and irregular, resembling the upper end of the femur in specimen 6. 377. The shaft of the radius is flattened laterally and curved forwards, and its'lower end is fused with the expanded part of the ulna. The lower articular surface of the radius looks obliquely backwards and inwards. At the upper end of both bones the bony ridges are exaggerated, and the insertions of the brachial anticus and biceps are unusually prominent. These changes were formerly ascribed to rickets, but the condition seems more allied to those of irregular exostos^ seen in some of the previous specimens. B. C. I. 6. M. lb. 6. 385. Mixed Tumour Of Bone.-Three sections of a small tumour (one macerated)-in spirit, illustrating the above It was attached by a narrow pedicle to the clavxc e of anadult It is composed of cancellous bone (resembhng that o the previous tumour), loose cartilage, and fat. far.

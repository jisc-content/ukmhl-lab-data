205 Atrophy of Bone. The metatarsals are extremely thin, and are ossified together at their bases. The three cuneiforms and the scaphoid are also ossified together. The os calcis and the cuboid are widely separated. The cancellated tissue is very light, and in many places has disappeared. The bones were fairly easily cleared of fat. q q 2820 Presented by P. H.

S "The skull is typically micro-cephalic; it is also asymme- trical, the right half of the cranial box being greater in its dimensions and more convexly arched than the left. This assymmetry is the result of a lesion in early life of the left cerebral hemisphere of the brain, whereby the growth of the latter was interfered with." The bones of the trunk and extremities present features which are to be etiologically associated with a right-sided

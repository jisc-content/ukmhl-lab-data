Fractures of the Humerus. 89 3. 124. Ununited Fracture at the Lower End of the Shaft. —Left humerus of an adult woman—macerated—showing the above. The patient, aged 40, after having been treated in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, for fractured humerus was discharged. On August 24, 1825, she was re-admitted for pain and a fluctuating swelling in the region of the fracture. Next day the swelling was incised, and a great .quantity of thin, glairy fluid was discharged. On the 10th of September, symptoms of septictemia appeared, the wound inflamed and suppurated, and on the 16th September she died suddenly, apparently much exhausted. The adjacent surfaces of hone are smooth, hut the provisional callous on the inner and front part seems to have united round the hone hefore death. The surface of the bone ahove and below the fracture is roughened and covered by new periosteal outgrowth in a way common in septic irritation. This seems to have been a case of ununited fracture with serous exudation round the broken ends, and septicaemia following the incision. The small part of callous union pro- bably occurred after the second admission to the Infirmary. G. C. 1011. 2. 125. United Fracture above the Condyles.—Adjacent portions of the right humerus and ulna of an adult—macerated —showing the effects of the above injury. The bone is broken about one and a half inches above the condyles. The lower fragment has been displaced forward, and over-riding has occurred. Inflammation has ensued in and around the elbow joint, and this has led to alteration of the articular surfaces and anchylosis. B. C. I. 1. M. 47. •3. 126.

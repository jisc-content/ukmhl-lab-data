152 Injuries of Bone. left tibia and fibula with the astragalus—macerated, showing the above. The tibia has been severely comminuted and split, and several of the fragments are wanting. The fibula seems also to have been broken about five inches from its lower end. G. C. 825. • Presented by Sir George Ballikgall. 3. 307. Compound Comminuted Fracture of the Lower End of the Tibia, involving the Ankle-joint-Astragalus and lower half of a right tibia and fibula—muscles cleaned off— in spirit, showing the above. The lower end of the upper fragment of the tibia is bare, and some of the portions of the lower fragment have been removed, so that the articular surface is no longer recognisable. The fibula has been broken about four inches from the lower end, and the fragments overlap. The upper surface of the astragalus is almost completely denuded of cartilage. The soft parts which remain round the ankle appear infiltrated with lymph. Severe suppuration has evidently followed the injury. G. C. 1055. Presented by Professor James Russell. 3 308. Badly united Fracture of the Lower End of the Tibia into the Ankle-joint.-Eight tibia, to which a small portion of the fibula adheres-macerated, showing the above. The union is very irregular, and a piece of the fibula has become attached to the tibia at the seat of fracture. The rest of the fibula is wanting. The main fracture has apparently been from above downwards and forwards, but the lower fragment has been comminuted into the ankle-joint. There is a slight forward bend at the point of union. The upper articular surface is set obliquely to the shaft, as m genu varum, i.e. with the shaft of the tibia sloping downwards and , B. C. i. 1. M. 39. inwards.

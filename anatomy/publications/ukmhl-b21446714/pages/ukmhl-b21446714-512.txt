Diseases of Joints. 480 Plaster of Paris cast of a left elbow-joint and forearm — after amputation, illustrating the above. The joint is much swollen, and a large unhealthy ulcer covers its outer and back part. P. P. C. 2882. 7. 141. Tubercular Disease of the Elbow, affecting chiefly the Humerus and Ulna.—Lower end of a left humerus—with ulna and radius—macerated, illustrating the above. " From a boy, aged 8, who had received a slight injury on the elbow. He got into the hands of an ignorant person, calling himself a bone-setter. The violence which this person at repeated intervals used, in order to reduce a supposed dislocation of the joint, no doubt gave rise to the scrofulous caries in the bone, and which is finely displayed in this pre- paration." The upper end of the ulna is much enlarged by new growth on the surface, and a piece of bone, forming apparently the original articular surface, has necrosed, and has been in process of separation, for the adjoining bone is separated from it by a groove. The upper end of the radius is slightly enlarged by new bone growth on the surface, and the epiphysis has disappeared. The humerus is likewise enlarged above the articular end by new periosteal bone formation. The epiphysis on the radial side alone remains. G. C. 735. Presented by James Pitcairn, F.R.C.S.E., 1825. 7. 142. Tubercular Arthritis, with Extensive Changes in the Adjacent Bones— Bones of the left fore-arm and lower end of humerus of a child — macerated, showing great changes in the humerus and ulna, but not in the radius. The ulna is enormously thickened in its upper half. The enlargement is tunnelled by rounded channels, which open at the articular surface, at the back, and at the outer side. The articular surface is so altered as to be scarcely recognisable. The lower end of the humerus presents similar changes, but

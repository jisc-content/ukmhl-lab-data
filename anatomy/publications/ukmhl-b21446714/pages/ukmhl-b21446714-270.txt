233 Diseases of Bone. The lower part of the bone, especially on the left side, has disappeared, and the surface round the missing part has been opened out and eroded. G. C. 596. c. Where the chief changes are in the form of enlargement. 6. 88. Thickening- of the Femur from Chronic Suppur- ative Inflammation of the Compact Tissue.—Left femur—macerated, to show the above. A portion of the new shell has been removed, to expose the condition of the original surface. The periosteal crust is about a quarter of an inch thick, while the original compact tissue is opened out and partly absorbed. This, therefore, seems to have been the seat of the disease, which, by its irritation, has led to the development of new bone from the periosteum. B. C. I. 5. M. 23. 6. 89. Thickening- of the Femur from Suppurative In- flammation of the Compact Tissue.-Anterior half of the upper end of a left femur—macerated, showing the above. The specimen is from the body of a man about 34 years of age. He bad complained for nearly eight months of acute pain in that thigh: which gradually swelled, and eventually was opened, and discharged a large quantity of pus. The medullary cavity is partially filled up by newly-formed cancellous tissue. Opposite this place,- on the outer side, the compact tissue has been opened out. On the surface much new bone has been formed, so as to produce a considerable thicken- in- which gradually fades off into a thin periosteal crust upon the'other parts of the shaft. The section has passed through a depression on this enlargement. In this case, therefore, the suppurative inflammation has found an exit opposite the centre of the new mass, and has not caused either necrosis or bone G. C. 1636. abscess. Presented by J.

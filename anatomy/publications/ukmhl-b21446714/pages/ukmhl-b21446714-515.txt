483 Tubercular Ostitis of Wrist. 7. 149. Tubercular and Septic Disease of the Wrist, involving- the Lower End of the Radius.—Lower end of a left radius—macerated, showing extensive changes at and near the articular surface. For about two inches above the articular surface the bone is greatly enlarged by numerous irregular periosteal outgrowths, the articular surface being rarefied and superficially eroded. This has all the appearance of a bone, upon which septic irritation has acted for some time, although probably initiated by tubercular disease. The differences between this and the last specimen may be due to a preponderance of septic influences upon this one. B. C. n. M. 28. 7. 150.—Senile Tuberculosis of the Bones of the Wrist. —Section of the bones of the left wrist of a man, aged 81— injected and in spirit, illustrating the above. This specimen is from the same arm as jSTo. 7.137, which see for full history. The preparation consists of a longitudinal section through the radius, ulna, and first row of carpal bones, and a transverse section through the second row of carpal bones. He had noticed his wrist enlarged for some months, but never had any pain in it. He could move it freely, and complained only of the disfiguration from the swelling. Non-vascular areas like that in the radius are seen in various stages of progress in the carpal bones. There are also caseous masses within the joints, especially between the radius scaphoid, and in the lower radio-ulnar joint, which is distended with them. In many places the articular cartilage is entirely removed. The well-authenticated absence of pain on movement is there- fore remarkable, but it may possibly be explained by the non-vascular caseous condition of the bone below the eroded cartilage. G. C. 2811.

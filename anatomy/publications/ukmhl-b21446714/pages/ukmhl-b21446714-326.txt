Diseases of Bone. 294 6. 240. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.—Skull-cap of an elderly person—macerated, illustrating the above. The changes are best seen at and behind the vertex. The bone is unchanged below the temporal ridges, but elsewhere it is more or less porous. At the back and to the left side of the sagittal suture there are numerous irregular apertures, due apparently to enlargement of vascular channels. At places near the vertex areas of bone are mapped out by pores and erosions, and the surface of the upper part of the occipital bone is similarly roughened. The interior of the skull-cap, especially near places most affected on the outside, shows marks of con- siderable vascularity, but there is practically no bone formation. There are two small bony projections near the front, one on either side of the longitudinal sinus—apparently, by their smoothness, of long standing. The skull-cap is apparently not thickened, but is increased in weight from condensation of the diploe. B. C. i. 7. M. 9. 6. 241. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.—Portion of left parietal bone—macerated, illustrating the above. There is great roughness on the outside, and sclerosis and thickening of the substance. The roughness on the outside is due to erosion, and the opening out and running together of vascular channels. The interior shows somewhat similar changes, only less marked. On the lower portion of the sawn surface the superficial openings are seen to penetrate well into the bone, and at some places to pass quite through it, while the bone on the section at the upper side is almost uniformly white and dense, like ivory.

Sir Charles Bell says : "I received a man who had got a musket shot through his shoulder at Brussels. The bones were shattered, and I resolved to make a free incision, and saw off the head of the humerus. I had pro ceeded so far as to extract the fractured portions, when I was called upon to consult by two inspecting surgeons who had that moment come into the room. They induced me to amputate at the shoulder 3oint, which I regretted, as it was against my own principles." The bullet has split off a fragment, carrying the upper * end of the bicipital groove, the lesser tuberosity, and the front of the greater tuberosity, and has thus freely exposed the cancellous texture at the back of the bone.

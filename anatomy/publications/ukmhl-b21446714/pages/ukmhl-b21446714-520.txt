488 Diseases of Joints. 7. 161. Advancing- Arthritis Deformans.—Right knee-joint of an adult, with the ligaments and muscles dissected off to expose the joint—in spirit. The cartilaginous surface of the femur is worn away at several places, especially on the trochlear surface, while the articular margin projects outwards as a shelf all round. There is an " adimentary hone " upon the tibia in front of the anterior crucial ligament. Changes similar to these on the femur, hut less advanced, are seen on the tibia. The articular surface of the patella is for the most part bared of cartilage, and at one spot it is eburnated. One or two pendulous processes are attached to the upper part of the patella. W. C. H. 40. 7. 162. Arthritis Deformans, with marked Fringing of the Synovial Membrane.—Right patella with adjacent soft parts—in spirit, illustrating the above. The synovial membrane is covered by a mass of long fringed processes. The cavity of the joint must have extended upwards for a considerable distance, and the interior of the extension has been furnished with similar processes. The cartilaginous surface of the patella seems normal. B. C. ii. M. 20. 7. 163. Arthritis Deformans, with marked Fringing- of the Synovial Membrane.—Lower end of a left femur, with the adjacent synovial membrane, from the subject from whom the last specimen was taken—in spirit. The synovial membrane is covered by a similar remarkable outgrowth of fringed processes, and the pouch above the patella has also been enlarged. It should be noted that although the changes in the synovial membrane are so advanced, there is no lipping or shelving out of the articular margin, and scarcely any change in the cartilage. The detachment of a piece of cartilage on the inner condyle may have been due to an accident. B. C. H. M. 21.

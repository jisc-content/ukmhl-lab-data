231 Bone affected by Neighbouring Congestion. with Chronic Ulcer Of the Leg".—Lower three-fourths of a left tibia and fibula—macerated, to show the above. The bones are anchylosed near their lower ends. The changes are most marked in the fibula, which is greatly thick- ened towards its lower end, and shows a very irregular surface. The tibia is also enlarged towards its lower end, but to a less extent. From the point of anchylosis downwards, the axis of each bone inclines slightly forwards. Possibly, therefore, this has been a case of fracture, followed afterwards by ulceration of the soft parts, and consequent periostitic development on the surface. B. C. i. 5. M. 67. 74. Bony Outgrowths on the Fibula, associated with Chronic Ulcer of the Leg-.—Lower half of a left fibula— macerated, showing the above. A portion of the outer surface about two inches from the lower end is depressed and porous, as if it had formed part of the floor of a deepening ulcer. On the remainder of the bone there are irregular outgrowths, similar to those seen in many of the previous specimens. B. Q i. 5. M. 9. 75. Bony Outgrowths of the Fibula, associated with Chronic Ulcer of the Leg-.—Lower half of a right fibula- macerated, showing the above. The surface of the bone is thick and irregular, and the antero-posterior diameter at the lower end is especially increased. The outer surface, a little above the malleolus, shows the porous, pitted character previously described as indicating the floor of a deepening ulcer. B_ C L 5 M_ g2_ i.

Injuries of Bone. 42 person, in which a fissure beginning on each side near the vertex extends downwards into the base, where the two meet. The fissure on the right side after splitting the parietal bone has loosened the squamous portion of the temporal bone from its articulations, and then has passed across the great wing and body of the sphenoid. The joint between the zygoma and the malar bone has been forced open. The main fissure on the left side, after running through the front of the parietal bone, has opened up the suture between the great wing of the sphenoid and squamous part of the temporal bone before passing to the base. A second fissure on this side extends through the squamous portion of the temporal bone, and after passing through the root of the zygoma meets the first one in the glasserian fissure. The left condyle of the occipital bone has been broken off. G- C- 3393- 3. 9. Fracture of the Base of the Skull.—Skull of a very old person—macerated—A quadrant has been removed from the vault to show the above. The fracture begins at the squamous suture on the right side as a fissure which passes through the roof of the tympanum, crosses irregularly the body of the sphenoid, and ends in the left foramen lacerum medium. The left mastoid process has been broken off. The left zygomatic arch has been broken. The upper jaw is edentulous, and the walls of the antrum are as thin as paper, and in some places wanting. It should be noted that the roof of the naso-pharynx has been involved in this and the last two specimens. G. C. 3312. 3.10. Longitudinal Fissure of the Right Parietal and Frontal Bones.—Calvarium of an old man—in which the sutures on the outer side are for the most part obliterated— showing the above fissure. The patient, having fallen about ten feet, had landed on his head on the stone causeway at Granton Breakwater. He lived in a comatose

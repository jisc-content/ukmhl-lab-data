217 Rickets. The bones have been altered in a way quite similar to that seen in the preceding specimen. The bend has been about the same spot, and the altered shape of the bones is traceable through the covering of the soft parts. The foot was quite flat. The cast was taken when the sole was resting on the ground, to show this point. G. C. 3284. Presented by Charles W. Cathcaut, F.R.C.S.E. 40. Distortion of the Femur from Rickets —Right femur of an adult—macerated, to show the above. The bone is stunted. The shaft is curved forward a little above the middle, and shows the usual lateral flattening at the curve, with increase of bone in the concavity. The inner condyle is unduly prominent downwards, and the person has probably therefore been knock-kneed. G. C. 1001, 41. Distortion of the Femur from Rickets.—Section of the right femur of an old man—macerated, to show the above. The bone is short and curved greatly forwards. The neck has sunk so as to relatively raise the trochanter. The section shows that at the bend the compact tissue is increased in front and even more so behind, and that the medullary cavity there is occupied by cancellous tissue. The femora were the only bones distorted in this case. q q 3Qgg Presented by Chaeles W. Cathcaet, F.R.C.S.E. ■ 42. Distortion of the Femur from Rickets.-Right femur of an adult—macerated, to show the above. The bone is stunted and the shaft curved forwards about tb e middle, with a corresponding lateral flattening of the curve and development of bone at its concavity. The angle of the neck is obtuse, and the trochanter is raised relatively to the head. The inner condyle projects downwards, so that this also has probably been a case of knock-knee. B. C. i. 3. M. 37.

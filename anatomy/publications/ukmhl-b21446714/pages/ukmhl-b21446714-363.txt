Syphilitic and Septic Disease. 331 7. Inflammation of Bone due to Syphilis, complicated by Sepsis. 6. 338. Syphilitic (?) Disease of the Tibia and Invasion by an Ulcer.—Portion of a right tibia—macerated, illustrating the above. Nearly all round the bone there is a thickening, which, to judge from the rarefaction on its inner surface, has probably formed the base of an ulcer. B. C. i. 5. M. 6. 6. 339. Syphilitic (?) Disease of the Tibia and Invasion by an Ulcer.—Lower end of the right tibia of a young man macerated. The epiphysis has not yet united. There is an enlargement on the inner aspect near the lower end, and the surface there is rarefied and depressed, as if it had formed the base of a deepening ulcer of the soft parts. This specimen has been considered syphilitic from the node-like character of the swelling, the comparative youth of the patient, and the absence of such surrounding periosteal new formation as is commonly associated with ordinary ulcera- ti0n' B. C. i. 5. M. 65. 6. 340. Syphilitic Disease of the Tibia, with Invasion by an Ulcer.-Portion of a left tibia-macerated, illustrating the above. On the shin surface there is a node, which is excavated and rarefied as if it had formed the floor of an extending ulcer of the soft parts. Some new periosteal bone has been formed up and down the shaft near the ulcer. G. C. 1007. 6.341. Syphilitic Disease of the Tibia, with Invasion by an Ulcer.-Eight tibia of a tall young man, with the epi- physis not yet united—macerated, illustrating the above.

Cartilaginous Tumours. 339 The weight of the specimen after the operation was twenty- one pounds, of which about eighteen pounds would belong to the tumour. The circumference of the tumour at the widest part was twenty-eight inches. Its consistence was firm and elastic, except at one or two spots, where it had become cystic. The outline was nodular, and several large veins were seen on the surface. In cutting the tumour calcareous nodules were met with, so that the knife and saw had to be used alternately. The tumour consists of nodules of cartilage varying from the size of a pea to that of a walnut. The smaller nodules, when fresh, were translucent and firm like the substance of the crystalline lens. The large ones were yellowish and some- what opaque, and in some cases had softened at the centre Bound the nodules there was a delicate stroma of connective tissue, carrying blood-vessels. From these, in some places, lime salts have been deposited, so as to form a calcareous shell round ' the nodules. Here and there, where several calcareous nodules have united, the interior is transformed into cancellous bone The outer part of the shaft of the humerus is thickened and sclerosed at the upper end, but the interior is unaffected The tumour seems to have started from the thickened part, and to have partially surrounded the humerus. Microscopically, the tumour was found to consist of hyaline cartilage without special features.

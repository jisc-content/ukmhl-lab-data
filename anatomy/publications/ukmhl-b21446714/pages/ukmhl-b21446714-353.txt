Syphilitic Enlargement. 321 A large node extends along the inner surface in the form of a diffused periosteal thickening, somewhat uneven on the surface. The interior of the node is compact and continuous with the shaft above, but elsewhere it is more or less cancellous where it lies on the shaft. "W. C. G. 21 a 6. 302. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Femur.-Posterior half of the lower end of a left femur—macerated, illustrating the above. The surface is irregular, from a deposit of condensed bone upon the compact shell. Near the lower end the process has been recent, and a film of new periosteal bone on the surface of the old thickening is clearly distinguishable at the inner part of the section. "W C G 21 a 6. 303. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Femur.-Posterior half of the middle three-fourths of a left femur-macerated illustrating the above. _ A large node is seen in section on the inner surface. It is condensed, except about the middle, where the tissue is more porous. The line of the original compact shell can, however, still be traced. W. C G 21 a 6. 304. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Femur.-Sections of upper end of a right femur-macerated, illustrating the above The surface is irregular from the formation of new densely compact bone, continuous with the original compact tissue and indistinguishable from it. This condensation often goes by the name of sclerosis. The medullary cavity is somewhat C°ntraCted- F. P. C. 393 and 394. Presented by Professor John Thomson. X

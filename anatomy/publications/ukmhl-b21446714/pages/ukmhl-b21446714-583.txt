551 Fatty Tumours. 9. 23. Very large Fatty Tumour.—Section of the above with the over-lying skin—in spirit. It was attached to the axilla, in an old woman, a subject in the dis- secting-rooms. The section shows the tumour to be composed of masses of fat bound together by layers of connective tissue into a uniform whole, which has no out-lying lobules. The centre of the tumour, where there is now a hollow, was filled with broken-down fat and oil, and many of the lobules near that part are softer in texture and darker in colour than those at the- periphery. This has been a degenerative change, associated with the great growth of the tumour. G. C. 3287. Presented by Johnson Symington, F.R.C.S.E., 1891. 9. 24. Very larg-e Fatty Tumour.—Papier mache cast of the previous specimen in situ, showing its relations to the arm and trunk. The tumour has evidently been slung in its covering of * skin from the region of the axdla. Possibly, this fact may explain its want of separate outlying lobules. G. C. 3288. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1891. 9. 25. Fibro-Fatty Tumour.—Lobulated fatty tumour, with fibro- fatty outgrowth projecting under the skin, the latter divided to show its structure—in spirit. It was removed from the region of the hip. The deeper part wbich has lain in the subcutaneous tissue has external lobules like those of an ordinary fatty tumour. The more superficial and larger part, which has pushed outwards and stretched the skin over it, is all in one piece. An examina- tion of its surface of section shows it to be composed of layers of fat and fibrous tissue arranged in an irregularly concentric manner round a fibrous core, which unites it to the part below.

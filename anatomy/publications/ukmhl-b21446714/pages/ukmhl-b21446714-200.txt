168 Injuries of Bone. This piece shows the bony anchylosis between the patella and the femur, and a depression in the bone which formed the bed of the bullet. B. C. xvn. 38. a. 3. 350. Bullet lodged in the Condyles of the Femur.— Popliteal nerves, with adjacent muscle and lymphatic gland, from the same case as the foregoing. Minute globules of mercury can be recognised on the section of the lymphatic gland and in the surrounding tissue. There is great matting of fibrous tissue round the nerves. B. C. xvn. 39. 3. 351. Bayonet Wound of the Lower End of a Femur.— Lower end of a right femur—macerated, showing the above. The bayonet wound was received at Waterloo. The leg was shattered, and required amputation above the knee. " Although, in this case, the question of amputation was decided by the shattered condition of the bones of the leg, the wound in the head of the femur (sic) is interesting to us, as being that which, although apparently slight, is attended with the most serious consequences. The wound is on that part of the bone, which implies that the point of the bayonet has penetrated the capsule of the joint. It was, in short, a punctured wound, which, if inflammation be not prevented, may be followed, as in the present instance, by suppuration within the joint" (Sir Charles Bell). [Instead of " inflammation," we would now say "sepsis."— C. W. C] There is an indentation by the bayonet on the side of the inner condyle. B- C- xvn" 37" 3. 352. Bullet Wound of the Head of the Tibia.-Upper half of a right tibia—macerated, showing the above. The round bullet which lodged at the back has been wired in position. The wound was received at Corunna.

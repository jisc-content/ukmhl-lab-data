85 Fractures of the Humerus. with distinct displacement. The upper fragment is tilted outwards and is rotated inwards. The articular surface of the head thus looks more backwards and less upwards than in a normal hone. The greater tuberosity recedes inwards from, instead of projecting beyond, the line of the outer surface of the shaft. The articular surface has been injured apparently post mortem. G. C. 3213. 3. 109. United Fracture through the Surgical Neck.— Right humerus—macerated—showing the above. The line of fracture has passed through the upper part of the surgical neck. The upper fragment has been tilted out- wards and rotated inwards in a way similar to that seen in the previous specimen. There is some irregularity in the bicipital groove and on the inner side, but the bone at the seat of fracture is quite smooth on the outside. G. C. 3214. 3/110. United Fracture through the Surgical Neck.— Plaster of Paris cast of a left humerus, showing the above. The line of fracture has apparently been at the upper part of the surgical neck, but the exact position is hidden by a considerable quantity of bone thrown out round about it. G. C. 3253. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C'S.E., 1890. 3.111. United Fracture through the Surgical Neck.— Plaster of Paris cast of a left humerus, showing the above. The line of fracture has passed somewhat obliquely down- wards and backwards from the bicipital groove. The upper fragment has been rotated inwards and tilted forwards so as to meet the lower fragment at an obtuse angle projecting forwards. The articular surface of the humerus is thus correspondingly altered in position. G. C. 3252 Presented by Charles W. Cathoabt, F.R.C- E., 1890.

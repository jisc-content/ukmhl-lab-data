Sarcomata. 555 9. 36. Sarcomatous Tumour.—A large tumour with overlying skin laid open—in spirit. " The tumour had been growing for eight years. The patient stated that it had followed a brain fever, during which ' he had several tumours on the back, all of which broke and dispersed excepting this one.' The tumour, about the size of two hands, lay between the shoulders. It was nodular on the surface, and had discharged blood and matter, so- as to weaken his health." At the operation, which was performed by Mr. Allen, haemorrhage was profuse. Eleven arteries were tied, and the actual cautery applied in two places. The patient died a fortnight after the operation apparently of pyaemia. The tumour has involved the skin and protruded through it. The cut surfaces show a series of fibrous intersections in a soft-looking substance, with an ill-defined capsule round about. G. C. 974. 9. 37. Sarcomatous Tumour of the Abdominal Wall.— Large portion of skin of the abdomen, from which numerous nodules of tumour growth project—in spirit. The patient was a married woman, aged forty. A tumour, composed of two masses "about the size of a fist," had originally been removed from her abdominal wall, and had been pronounced at the time of the operation to be sarcomatous. This tumour had returned, and had grown for two years before the patient consulted Dr. Thomas Keith, who removed it. Some years after the second removal, the patient was seen by Dr. Skene Keith. She was then in good health, without any indication of a return of the tumour. The masses posteriorly have an imperfect form of capsule round them. Anteriorly they involve the skin. G. C. 2922.

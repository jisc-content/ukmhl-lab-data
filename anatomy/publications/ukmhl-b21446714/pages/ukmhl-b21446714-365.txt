333 Syphilitic and Septic Disease. A large and very irregular piece of bone on the shin surface has probably been exposed on the floor of an ulcer. It is deeply entrenched all round except at the upper end. An aperture on the oblique ridge behind exposes the necrosed bone at the back, but the deep attachments are otherwise still quite firm. The general surface of the shaft is very rough from new periosteal formation. At the lower end the inner and posterior surfaces are greatly eroded, and show apparently a necrosis of the interior, which has extended to the outer part of the articular surface. The fibula is unchanged, with the exception of a new periosteal deposit on the surfaces adjacent to the tibia. F. P. C. 447. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 6. 344. Syphilitic (Mercurial?) Disease of the Tibia, with Necrosis.—Left tibia and fibula from the same patient as the last—macerated, illustrating the above. There are two partially separated necroses—one just above the middle, distinctly entrenched round but still adherent; the other above the lower end, much rougher on its surface, and less distinctly entrenched below, where it merges'into a carious condition of the surrounding bone. The rest of the tibia is thickened by new periosteal bone, with a porous surface. The lower articular surface of the tibia is affected apparently by necrosis of the bone over an area corresponding to that on the right side but less advanced. The upper articular surface is unchanged. This fibula, like the right one, is comparatively unchanged. F p c 44g_ Presented by Professor John Thomson. 1-5. Syphilitic (Mercurial?)

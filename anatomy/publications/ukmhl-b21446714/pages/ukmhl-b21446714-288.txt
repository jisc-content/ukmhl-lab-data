256 Diseases of Bone. Necrosis, Periosteal Enlargement.—Tibia of a young person, in which the shaft having been necrosed has been surrounded by a new shell—macerated. In this case there is a central sequestrum, wbich has originally consisted of almost the entire shaft. During the process of separation, however, it has been partially absorbed, and, as seen through the cloacae, it is in many places rough and irregular. The shell surrounding the sequestrum, although so well formed, is slightly bent. It has numerous cloacal apertures. G. C. 1183. Figured in Russell on " Necrosis," plate i. page 177. 6. 124. Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis—Necrosis, Chronic Periosteal Enlargement.—Portion of the shaft of a femur or tibia—macerated, illustrating the above. A section has been made of part of the new case to show its thickness. The sequestrum has evidently included the greater part of the diaphysis. The surface of the new case at places is eroded, but this has probably happened during the preparation of the specimen. B. C. I. 5. M. 37. 6. 125. Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis of the Tibia- Necrosis, Chronic Enlargement. — Lower two-thirds of the right tibia of a young person—injected, soft parts cleaned off and in spirit, illustrating the above. Upon the front of the preparation there is a considerable excavation, and in a crevice at its lower end there is a small loose scale of necrosed bone. The appearance of excavation is evidently due to irregular development of new bone round a superficial necrosis, which has now disappeared. Tbis was formerly described as an ulcer of the tibia. If an ulcer of the skin had been present over the affected part of the tibia, as is probable, the ulcer in this case will have been secondary to the bone disease. B. C. r. 5. M. 2.

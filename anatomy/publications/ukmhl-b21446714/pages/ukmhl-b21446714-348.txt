316 Diseases of Bone, The bone is increased in weight, and its surfaces are encrusted with new periosteal bone, probably from syphilis. B. C. i. 5. M. 12. 6. 285. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Humerus.-Section of a right humerus—injected with vermilion, partially cleaned and in spirit. The specimen is from a patient who was supposed to have had syphilis. There is thickening of the shaft at the back of the lower end, and patches of vascularity and crusts of new periosteal bone are scattered up and down. B. C. I. 5. M. 1. 6. 286. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Humerus.-Right humerus—macerated, illustrating the above. The bone is increased in weight, and is thickened on its inner and posterior surfaces, especially at the junction of the lower and middle thirds, where a large node has been formed. The prominent part of the node is formed of irregular pro- jections, which get smaller towards the margin. The head and neck show little change. B- C- L 5- M" 89' 6 287. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Humerus.-Upper portion of left humerus from the same patient as the last- macerated, illustrating the above. The disease on this side is more advanced. A node, some- what similar to the last, but at a lower level, has been present This node, however, has contained a necrosed piece of bone, still adherent but in process of separation, and having cloacae leading to it A section has been made through one of the cloacae to sbow the structure. The whole of the upper part of the shaft is encrusted with new periosteal bone,, except here and there where the original surface is seen through it. ^ ^ ^ ^

Anchylosis after Tuberculosis of Knee. 457 the back of the joint. On the side of the inner condyle the shreddy wall of a tubercular abscess can be seen laid open. G. C. 3230. Presented by A. G. Millek, F.R.C.S.E. 7.79. Tubercular Arthritis, breaking- out after Sub- sidence.—Outer section of the bones of the previous knee- joint—macerated, to show the changes on the articular surface and the absorption of bone. The cartilage was entirely removed from the articular surfaces, which are altered in shape and irregular on the surface. The adjacent parts of the tibia and femur show slight erosions, partly smoothed over. The trochlear surface of the femur and articular surface of the patella show rarefaction, also smoothed over. Irregular spicules of periosteal bone roughen the tibia and femur near the articular surfaces. G. C. 3231. 7. 80. Tubercular Arthritis with Developing- Anchylosis. —Bones forming a right knee-joint—partially macerated and in spirit. The bone has apparently been accidentally broken in the process of preparation, and the broken pieces are held together by threads. The bones have been fixed in the flexed position. The interior of both femur and tibia has been greatly absorbed, and the bone has been soft and fatty. The patella is united, apparently by bone, to the front of the articular surface of the outer condyle, and the inner condyle and inner tuberosity of the tibia are united partly by bone and partly by fibrous tissue. The inner condyle and inner tuberosity of the tibia are not in contact. q

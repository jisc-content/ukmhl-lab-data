The cavity has evidently been formed by new growth on the outer surface, with absorption from within. G. C. 1219. Presented by Professor James Russell. 6. 102. Enormous Enlargement of the Upper End of the Tibia from an Abscess in the Interior.—The other half of the foregoing specimen—in spirit, illustrating the above. This specimen shows the abscess cavity lined with granula- tions, also the plug of wood and tow alluded to in the history of the case, as when the patient wore it. G. C. 1218.

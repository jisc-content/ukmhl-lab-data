Bony Outgrowths on the Tibia and Fibula associated With Chronic Ulcer Of the Leg.-Left tibia and fibula- macerated, showing the above. The patient was a man aged 64. At the age of 42, the skin of his • le* had been extensively burned at the upper and outer parts. The wound had healed, but the scar had broken down seven years before his Emission to the Infirmary, and had formed a large ulcer on the upper and outer part of the leg. This ulcer had remained open, and latteily had Ucome epithelioma^ at the upper part. The leg was amputated on account of the epithelioma. Both bones, but especially the fibula, show considerable thickening and new periosteal formation. The surface of the fibula is covered with irregular stalactite processes, which to a certain extent follow the line of attachment of the interosseous membrane and of the inter-muscular septa; but there is also considerable thickening on the subcutaneous area above, the outer malleolus. The portions of the tibia most affected are the oblique and interosseous ridges, and the upper part of the extensor surf ace. At these places the surface of the bone is covered with irregu ar processes similar to those seen on the fibula. The articular surfaces of the knee and ankle are comparatively Presented by Charles W.

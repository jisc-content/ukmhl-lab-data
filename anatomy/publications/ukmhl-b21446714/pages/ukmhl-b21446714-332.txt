300 Diseases of Bone. The reason for the trephine opening does not appear. The specimen shows an irregular piece of necrotic bone partially entrenched round, and with vascular channels in process of opening out extending beyond. The inside shows some enlargement of vascular pores. The diploe' is condensed. The margin of the trephined aperture shows that the above patch of bone was being undermined from below as well as from the 6. 255. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull, with Neerosis.- Skull-cap of an old personâ€”macerated, illustrating the above. The outer surface at the top shows roughness, chiefly from the increased size of the pores for blood-vessels. Above the right frontal eminence is a depression with a raised margin. The edges are rounded off, as if the part had been healing. Below the left parietal eminence an area of one and a half inches by three-quarters of an inch has been in process of separation, and is entrenched round by a distinct groove. The surface of this piece is porous and rough, as in other cases of syphilitic necrosis. Below the right temporal ridge the parietal bone has been trephined for reasons unknown. On the inside, below the mark near the right frontal eminence, there is a distinct thickening of bone, with marks of increased vascularity. Beneath both parietal eminences, especially the left, there are marks of increased vascularity. The diploe is condensed, and the bone is much increased in weight. The posterior part of the sagittal suture is entirely obliterated. 1 B. C. i. 7. M. 11. 6. 256. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull, with Necposis.- Portion of a parietal bone-macerated, illustrating the above. A small necrotic piece, which is eroded on the surface, 18 partly undermined as well as grooved round. The interior of the bone shows marks of increased vascularity, and the diploe is,

Syphilitic Necrosis. 309 From the skull of a young gentleman who died of affection of the spine. The piece of bone is markedly irregular on both surfaces, and presents the usual characteristics of a syphilitic sequestrum. G. C. 1620. Presented by Adam Huntek, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 269. Sequestrum after Syphilitic Disease of the Skull.— Sequestrum (sawn through at one spot), formerly described as " mercurial exfoliation " of both sides of the skull. The necrosis has involved the whole thickness of the skull, and both surfaces, but especially the inner, show the roughness and irregularity characteristic of a syphilitic sequestrum. F. P. C. 481. 6. 270. Sequestrum after Syphilitic Disease of the Skull. —Sequestrum involving the whole thickness of the skull. Both surfaces show irregularity characteristic of a syphilitic sequestrum. G. C 1167 e. Specimens illustrating healing after separation of syphilitic sequestra. 6. 271. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull after Separation of Sequestrum.—Frontal portion of a calvarium, with scalp—in spirit, illustrating the above. Just below the roots of the hair, to the right of the middle line, there is a small healed ulcer of the skin, with a small fv&e- O ment of necrosed bone on its base. The margins of the ulcer are smooth, and, though somewhat overhanging, seem completely covered with epithelium. On the floor below the necrosed fragment the bone is covered by a thin layer of fibrous-looking material, possibly epithelium. The interior of the bone lias dura mater clinging to it in many places, and where bare shows marks of increased vascularity. The skull itself is thickened and condensed. B. C i 7 M 1

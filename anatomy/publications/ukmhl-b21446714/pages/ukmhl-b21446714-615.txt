Fiat-Foot. 583 11.43. Flat Foot.—Dissection of the foregoing foot—inspirit. It will be seen that the head of the astragalus Las slipped down from its proper place, and has carried the scaphoid with it. Considerable portions of the upper and inner facettes for articulation with the tibia have escaped from their contact with the tibia, while the cartilaginous area on the head, usually- supported by the calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, is relatively much larger than usual. The tubercle of the scaphoid must have- pressed through its covering of soft parts on to the ground. G. C. 3238. Presented by Henry D. Littlejohn, F.R.C.S.E., 1891. 11. 44.

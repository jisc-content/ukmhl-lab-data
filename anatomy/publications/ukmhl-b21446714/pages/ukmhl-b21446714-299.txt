Invasion of Bone from Ulcers. 267 Section of a tibia—injected with vermilion and in spirit, to illustrate the above. The granulating margin of an ulcer of the soft parts has been left surrounding an area of the bone, which has evidently- formed its base. Part of this area is covered by imperfect granulations, part is bare, and part shows a development of new sponge-like bone. The section shows the compact tissue beneath the ulcer to have been thickened by a deposit on the surface. B. C. i. 5. M. 3. 0, 159. Ulcer of the Leg- extending down to the Bone.— Section of the previous specimen—macerated, to illustrate the above. The surface of the bone which lay underneath the granula- tions on the floor of the ulcer is rough and porous. It has been a new development, but has apparently been invaded by the ulcer as it became deeper. B. C. i. 5. M. 3. 6.160. Invasion of the Tibia by an Ulcer of the Leg.— Portions of a tibia—macerated, to illustrate the above. Over an area of about three inches in length the bone is hollowed out, and is porous on the surface, while irregular bone has been developed round about. Apparently this has been caused by an ulcer of leg extending downwards into the bone. B. C. i. 5. M. 17. 61. Invasion of the Tibia by an Ulcer of the Leg.— Portion of an injected right tibia. Soft parts removed, except those which formed the ulcer-in spirit, to illustrate the above. An area of the bone has been exposed on the floor of the ulcer, and a section has been made to show the relations of

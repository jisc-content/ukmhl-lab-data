The remains of the bicipital groove is seen between the upper parts of the altered tuberosities. The glenoid cavity is flattened and enlarged by growth of bone at the margins. The lower portion of the surface is rarefied. At the lower end of the bone there is considerable prominence of the muscular attachments and some irregularity of the cartilage on the capitellum. "W.

The shaft of the humerus from the attachment of th& deltoid upwards is curved outwards, and is flattened from within outwards, i.e. the reverse direction to the flattening in a rickety curve. (There is, however, one ridge in this concavity which partly corresponds to the usual development of bone in the con- cavity of the arch.) The outer lip of the bicipital groove is prominent below, but the inner lip can hardly be recognised anywhere. The head of the bone is wanting, having apparently been absorbed, and what represents the articular surface is irregular and at places eburnated. At the upper margin of what represents the head, there is an irregular projection of bone, as in the two previous specimens. The glenoid cavity of the scapula has been absorbed at its central parts and towards the- back, Avhile a thick ridge of bone has been thrown out all round the margins, especially above and below. The cavity thus deepened and enlarged resembles an imperfect acetabulum, The surface is irregular, being at places both porous and eburnated. When the bones are articulated, the upper part of the humerus, as in the previous specimen, comes close under- neath the acromion process. G. C. 1193.

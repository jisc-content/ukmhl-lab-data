Diseases of Joints. destruction on the sides, especially on the right. The second and third lumbar vertebra? are comparatively unchanged, but upon the right side and hack of the fourth lumbar vertebra the bone is rarefied and absorbed. Whatever may have been the state of the column above the eleventh dorsal vertebra, the part below it shows a con- dition similar to that seen in the last specimen, namely,, separate seats of tubercular disease, which have as yet not led to much absorption or alteration in the spinal column as a whole. G C. 1181. 224. Early Stage of Tubercular Disease.—Two lumbar vertebrae of a child affected evidently by tuberculosis in an early stage, soft parts removed—in spirit. The following is Sir Charles Bell's description :— " This is a specimen of the diseased state of the vertebra?, which precedes the destruction of their bodies, and the con- sequent yielding to the superincumbent weight. There was, in this case, paralysis of the legs, probably in consequence of inflammation of the bone attacking the spinal marrow; as there is here no compression of the spinal marrow to account for the paralysis, on mechanical principles, we must suppose it is the- influence of the contiguous inflammation, and not the curvature of the spine and pressure of the spinal marrow, which produces- paralysis." It is now recognised, as succeeding specimens will show, that paralysis in "Potts' Curvature" is very often, if not invariably, caused by mechanical pressure upon the cord or nerves. B. C. 1. 3.

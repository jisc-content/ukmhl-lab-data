547 Enlargement of Bursa Patellcc. The chief swelling is over the lower end of the radius, but there is also a smaller swelling over the head of the ulna. The main swelling is markedly lobulated, and at some places rises into nobs. This was formerly described as a diseased bursa, but the cast itself has the word " exostosis " written upon it. Probably, however, it was a ganglion, associ- ated with arthritis deformans, and so tense that it felt like bone. F. P. C. 2933. BURS^E. (Injuries.) Diseases. I.

Great Enlargement and Distension of the Bursa Patellae.—A large sac, with a portion of the skin and under- lying soft parts, dissected from the front and outer side of a knee—in spirit. The patient, a woman aged 50, had been aware of the swelling for •nineteen years. The main sac is lined by a somewhat flocculent membrane. Behind the sac there was a considerable thickening, composed of fibrous tissue, enclosing soft, friable material. This is a form of chronic enlargement of the bursa, the nature of which is obscure.

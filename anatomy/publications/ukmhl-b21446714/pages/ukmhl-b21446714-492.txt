460 Diseases of Joints. the under part of the trochlear surface. The back of each condyle has been anchylosed to the corresponding tuberosity of the tibia; but the tibia is partially dislocated backwards and rotated outwards. In this specimen, however, the rotation has chiefly occurred by the bending outwards of the shaft of the femur, just above the condyles, possibly from twisting round a crutch. The bones are light and greasy. F. P. C. 817. Presented by Professor James Russell. 7. 87. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Bones of a left knee-joint—macerated, illustrating the above. The joint has been in the semi-flexed position. The patella is united by bone to the lower part of the outer condyle. The inner condyle is also firmly united by bone to the inner tuberosity of the tibia, while the back of the outer condyle has been anchylosed by fibrous tissue to the front of the outer tuberosity of the tibia. The tibia has been dislocated back- wards and rotated outwards upon the articulation between the inner tuberosity and the inner condyle. The bones are better developed and less greasy than in the three foregoing specimens. W. C. H. 47. 7. 88. Anchylosis after Tubercular Arthritis.—Bones of a left knee-joint—macerated, illustrating the above. The joint has been only slightly flexed. The patella is united by bone to the outer condyle. The inner condyle is united by bone to the inner tuberosity. In this, as in the previous specimen, the tibia is dislocated backwards and rotated outwards round the inner part of the articulation. There is a tendency of the femur and tibia to be curved backwards above and below the joint, thus partially undoing the flexion there. The bones are light and greasy. F. P. C. S16.

Fractures of the Femur. 129 It may be observed in this, as in many of the previous speci- mens, that no callous formation has at least been permanent, except between the broken surfaces of the bone, where it is of service in uniting them. G. C. 363. 3. 235. United Fracture about the Middle of the Shaft. —Posterior section of lower end of a left femur—macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment has lain in front of the lower, and the broken ends have been drawn inwards. The union has evidently been of long standing. B. C. i. 1. M. 33. f. 3. 236. Badly united Fracture about the Middle of the Shaft.—Right femur—macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment is in front of the lower. They both over-ride to a considerable extent, and at their junction form an obtuse angle, pointing inwards. The lower fragment is rotated outwards through an angle of about 45°. The medullary cavity is closed in, and the ends are united by an irregular mass of bone. F. P. C. 123. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 3. 237.

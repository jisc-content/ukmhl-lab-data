296 Diseases of Bone. bone ulceration, as it has been called, and the changed and unchanged parts are in close proximity. A certain amount of symmetry in the diseased patches is seen on the frontal bone, and on the front of the parietal; but the most advanced patch, which is on the right of the vertex, has no corresponding patch on the left side. At some places the bone is quite smooth, and at others the vascular channels are opened out, sometimes into fine pores, sometimes into pits and erosions, as noticed in previous specimens. On the patch to the right of the vertex these excavations have nearly encircled a piece of bone, which is itself porous. These excavations, or bone ulcers, seem to have been advancing on the right side, while others on the left have been healing over. The interior of the skull over the vault is roughened by enlargement of vascular channels. The diploe is almost entirely filled up by sclerosed bone, and the skull is somewhat increased in weight. The sutures are unusually distinct. B- C- l- 7- M- 23' 6. 245. Syphilitic (?) Disease of the Skull.-Portion of a skullâ€”macerated, illustrating the above. There is a loss of substance on the outer surface, which has penetrated into the interior. The section shows the bone to be thickened and sclerosed. F. P. C. 2962. (b.)

The upper surface, especially near the vertex, is roughened, but the irregularities are rounded off as if healing. On the inner aspect, especially at the upper portion of the longitudinal sinus, there are marks of increased vascularity. ^ ^

Alterations in Skeleton in a Case of Paralysis and Idiocy.—Photograph of the posterior aspect of the above patient showing the condition immediately after death. G. C. 3498. Presented by Alexis Thomson, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 20. Atrophy of the Bones of the Leg and Foot, from Infantile Paralysis.—Bones of the foot and lower two-thirds of tibia and fibula—partially macerated and cleaned, to show the above. The limb was soaked in Mullet's fluid, which has turned the bones green. The patient had been affected by infantile paralysis. In conse- quence, this leg and foot did not grow in proportion to the other one, and became useless. It was therefore amputated. The bones are both somewhat bent outwards, as m fco. 6 12. The shafts of the tibia and fibula are thin, and the usual ridges are wanting. The compact tissue, however, is not atrophied in proportion to the diminished size. The bones of the foot are light and very greasy. *»■ ^ i3Jt ■ Presented by Alexis Thomson, 1893.' 6. 21. Alterations in Bone '.due to Locomotor-ataxia.- Specimen wanted. D.

Tulcrcular Synovitis of Knee-joint. 447 A small portion of the outer articular surface alone remains, the rest of the upper surface of the bone is eroded and rarefied. There is a deep excavation with a septum at the bottom of it on the front of the inner articular surface, and a small excava- tion behind it. The altered portion of the outer articular surface has the appearance of newly-formed processes of bone filling up a cavity such as exists on the other side. A considerable amount of new bone has been thrown out round the tuberosities below the articular surfaces. F. P. C. 779. 54. Invasion of Articular Surfaces from Tubercular Synovitis.-—Upper end of a right tibia, with very deep erosions. • Large and deep rounded cavities are seen on both sides of the inner and on the front of the outer articular surfaces, the largest being that on the posterior part of the inner tuberosity, where there is a rounded depression large enough to lodge the end of a man's middle finger. There is little or no new periosteal bone formed round the tuberosities. F. P. C. 780. 55. Invasion of Articular Surfaces from Tubercular Synovitis.—Upper end of a right tibia, showing very deep erosions. There are very large and deep excavations upon the inner condyle, especially towards the back. One extends down into the bone for about three-quarters of an inch. Little or no new bone is formed round the tuberosities. F. P. C. 774. 56.

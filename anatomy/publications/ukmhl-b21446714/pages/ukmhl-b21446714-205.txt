Gunshot Fractures of the Tibia. 173 Presented by Professor John Thomson. Lower three-fourths of a right tibia and fibula—macerated, showing the above. The fragments are wired in position. "The fracture of the tibia and fibula would not have warranted amputation, had the foot not also been shattered. Remark. Indeed, if the majority of these cases of gunshot fracture had been treated early, and free incisions made down to the bone, many of them might have done well, without amputation. It was the circumstances in which they were found that made amputation necessary, and at the same time almost a hopeless measure" (Sir Charles Bell). The fibula is broken irregularly, and the tibia comminuted. The comminution of the tibia, however, is less than in the previous specimens, but the splitting of the remaining portions of the shaft is somewhat more extensive. A layer of newly formed periosteal bone, slightly thicker than in the preceding specimens, is seen above and below the seat of injury. B. C. xvn. 47. 364. Gunshot Fracture of the Tibia.—Upper end of a left tibia—macerated, to show the above. One loose piece is wired in position. The wound was received at "Waterloo. Necrosis has been present at the seat of fracture, and the line of separation has begun. New periosteal bone has been thrown out on the adjacent portion of the shaft. F. P. C. 252. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 365. Gunshot Fracture of the Tibia—Portion of the shaft of a tibia—macerated, showing the above. The patient was wounded at Waterloo. The features of this specimen are essentially similar to those of the foregoing, there being indications of a septic compound fracture. Necrosis has begun at the seat of fracture and new periosteal bone has been thrown out on the adjacent! portion of the shaft. F p ^ '

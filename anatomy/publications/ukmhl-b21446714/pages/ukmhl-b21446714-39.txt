The right upper incisor has curved round upon itself, and by pressure has caused absorption of the left upper jaw, which it has in this way penetrated. An additional ill-developed incisor lies behind it. The left upper incisor—though also overgrown—is shorter than its fellow, and has rubbed against the side of the left lower incisor.

The lower end of the tibia is enlarged at the sides and hollowed out in front. The astragalus is anchylosed by bone to the lower end of the tibia, and its original shape is scarcely recognisable. The os calcis, in like manner, is anchylosed to the astragalus. The texture of these two tarsal bones, as well as of the lower end of the tibia, is expanded and light.

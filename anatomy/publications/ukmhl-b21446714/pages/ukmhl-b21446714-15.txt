Preface. xi Skull have been kept separate from those of the rest of the skeleton; but with this exception, " locality " has not been used as a basis of subdivision in this Series. Never- theless, an examination of the groups formed will show that " locality" has accompanied the " results " due to the various " causes " in a remarkably close way. Thus there are various forms of necrosis, caries, and enlargement, depending upon different causes, and showing corresponding differences, but also locating themselves mainly in different bones, or forms of bone tissue. " Locality " might therefore have been used as subsidiary to " result" through all the groups of bone disease had it seemed necessary. Among joints, on the other hand, "locality" has been considered of more importance, and has been used to divide and subdivide the specimens ranged under the various causes of Inflammation. In every case we must remember that "the division must be founded upon one principle or basis," i.e., " some quality or circumstance," which, in order to be taken as the basis of sub-division, "must be present with some and absent with others, or must vary with the different species comprehended in the genus."* What that basis is will depend upon the general character of the specimens, the state of knowledge at the time the classification is made, and the judgment of the classifier. It is true that some forms of cross-classification still remain, but while they seem inevitable, they are less likely to confuse than those now excluded. Thus, for example, many diseases of joints affect chiefly the bones; compound fracture may lead to * Jevons' "Elementary Lessons in Loijic," 1893, p. 105.

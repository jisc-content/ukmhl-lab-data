Injuries of Bone. 76 was turbid and ammoniacal. The patient's bladder was washed out, and his bedsores attended to. In spito of all treatment, he got gradually weaker, and died, partly of exhaustion, and partly of septic absorption, about two months after his admission. The portion suspended above shows well the compression and crushing of the anterior part of the body of the twelfth, with the forward displacement of the eleventh dorsal vertebra, so as to diminish the spinal canal by drawing the laminae of the eleventh towards the upper part of the body of the twelfth. The portion of the specimen suspended below shows the effect of this displacement upon the lower end of the cord, and the nerves accompanying it. G-. C. 3316. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 86. Dislocation forwards of the eleventh, with Fracture and crushing- backwards of the Body of the twelfth Dorsal Vertebra.—Last two dorsal and upper two lumbar vertebras—cleaned and dried—showing the above injury. The right halves of the bodies have been removed, so as to dis- play the canal from the front. The patient lived for about six weeks after the accident. The crushing backwards of the last dorsal body has been so great that at their anterior margins, the lower border of the eleventh dorsal and the upper border of the first lumbar verte- bra? almost touch, and the body of the twelfth dorsal vertebra has been crushed back upon the canal, so as to com- pletely obliterate it. F. P. C. 51. 3. 87. Dislocation forwards of the last Dorsal, with Fracture and Displacement of the first Lumbar Vertebrse.—Section of the bodies and laminfe of the last two dorsal and first four lumbar vertebra?—with the muscles cleaned off—in spirit, showing the above condition. The patient was a coal miner, and while working in a pit was struck on the back by a mass of earth.

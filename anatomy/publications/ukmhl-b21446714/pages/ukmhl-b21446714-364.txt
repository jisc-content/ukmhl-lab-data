332 Diseases of Bone. The lower part of the tibia shows a node-like thicken- ing which extends nearly all round. The thickening rises abruptly from the surrounding bone above. Its surface is rough and porous, as if it had formed the base of an extending ulcer. One or two smaller nodes may be seen above the large one. The bone is unusually light. The grounds for believing this to be a case of syphilis are the presence of the nodes, and of so large an ulcer in so comparatively young a person. (See No. 6. 339.) G. C. 1179.

On the inner or shin surface there is a smooth node-like swelling above the middle, and lower down two abrupt nodes, which may have lain beneath ulcers of the skin. The upper of these two is the smaller and has a porous surface. The other larger one has its surface partly smooth and partly porous. The outer and posterior surfaces of the bone are rough and irregular. The medullary cavity is occupied by cancellous bone beneath the upper node, and at other places shows irregular dilations. These in old syphilitic bones usually contain fat, not pus or caseous matter, as might possibly be supposed. The tissue of the bone is on the whole lightened, and the compact outer layer has for the most part been replaced by cancellous tissue. J B. C. i. 5. M. 78, 79. 6. 343. Syphilitic (Mercurial?)

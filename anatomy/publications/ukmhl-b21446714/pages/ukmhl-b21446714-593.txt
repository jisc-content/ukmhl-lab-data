Sarcomata. 561 The cut surface shows traces of fibrous intersections, but the texture is on the whole uniform and very vascular. G. C. 109. Presented by William Brown, F.R.C.S.E., 1808, 9. 54. Sarcoma of Forearm.—Plaster cast of the right forearm and part of hand from which the previous specimen was obtained. The cauliflower-like fungating mass projecting through the skin is well shown. This cast, or the arm itself, has been figured in Wardrop's Work on "Fungus Hsematodes," Plate 4. In the Plate, how- ever, the artist has drawn a left hand, but it is evident that this has been added after the sketch of the tumour wae made. The tumour itself, figured in Plate 5, as the specimen belonging to the same arm as that shown in Plate 4, undoubtedly has grown on the right side. This has been determined from the portion of the ulna left attached to the tumour. P. P. C. 2903. 9. 55. Sarcomatous Tumour.—Portion of a sarcomatous tumour flocculent and broken down. Entered as a specimen of "fungus hasniatodes." G. C. 1747. Presented by Dr. Thomson. 9. 56. Sarcoma of Neck.—Portion of a tumour removed from the neck—in spirit. The tumour has apparently been invading the muscle round about and breaking down in the centre. G. C. 3143 Presented by Macdonald Brown, F.K.C.S.E., 1890. . 57. Sarcoma Of the Buttock.—Section of a small fungati tumour—in spirit. 2 N

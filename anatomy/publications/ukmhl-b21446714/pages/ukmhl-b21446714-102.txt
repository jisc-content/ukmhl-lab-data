70 Injuries of Bone. cervical vertebra has been dislocated forwards ; on the right side the lower articular process with adjacent part of lamina has been broken from the rest of the bone. There has been a slight fracture of the upper part of the body of the seventh cervical vertebra, especially towards the left side. G- C. 173a. Presented by "William Brown, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 75. Dislocation between the last Cervical and first Dorsal Vertebrae.—Last three cervical and upper three dorsal vertebrae, with the muscles cleaned off—in spirit- showing the above dislocation. '' The man fell headlong from a barge lying aground in the Thames. His head stuck in the mud, and the whole weight of his trunk and limbs was thrown on the neck, and an obliquity in the direction of the force probably twisted the vertebra. He died instantly." There seems to be no indication of fracture. The dura mater is seen between the separated vertebras. B. C. 1. 4. M. 7. 3. 76. Severe Crushing- Fracture of the third and fourth Dorsal Vertebrae.— First seven dorsal vertebrae, with the adjacent parts of the ribs—cleaned, dried, and varnished, and the canal exposed by the removal of the laminae on the right side, showing the above condition. The patient was a lad, aged seventeen. There was paralysis below the injury, with priapism. He lived twenty-five days. The adjacent parts of the third and fourth bodies have been greatly crushed. The remainder of the body of the third, with those of the vertebras above, have been displaced forwards. The heads of the fourth ribs on both sides, as well as those of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs on the right side have been broken. The spine of the first, and the spines and laminae of the second and third vertebrae, have also been fractured. The cord must have been crushed. This has evidently been a case of fracture by forcing the spine forwards. Presented by Wm. Brown, F.R.C.S.E., 1807.

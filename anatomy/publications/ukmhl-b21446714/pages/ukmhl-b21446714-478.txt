Invasion of Articular Surfaces from Tubercular Synovitis.—Upper ends of a right tibia and fibula. The articular surface of the tibia is greatly rarefied, and on the inner side is somewhat eroded as well. F. P. C. 768. 7. 51. Invasion of Articular Surfaces from Tubercular Synovitis.—Upper end of a right tibia. The outer and a small portion of the inner articular sur- face remains, but the remainder of the upper surface of the bone is rough from rarefaction and erosion. Some new bone has been formed round the inner tuberosity. P. P. C. 777. 7. 52. Invasion of Articular Surfaces from Tubercular Synovitis.—The articular ends of a right femur and tibia— showing extensive alterations at and near the articular surfaces. Portions of the cartilaginous surface remain on the outer and inner condyles of the femur, the remainder of the adjacent bone beino- rarefied and eroded. The articular surfaces of the tibia are more extensively eroded, especially on the outer side, where there is a deep excavation. A crust of new periosteal bone has formed round the articular ends of both bones, no doubt from a septic condition of the joint. The original texture of both bones is much lightened. F- P. C. 778.

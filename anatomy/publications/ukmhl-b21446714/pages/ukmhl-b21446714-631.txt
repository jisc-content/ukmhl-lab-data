Anatomy of Stumps. 599 of a left arm after the above, injected with coarse injection and dissected—in spirit. This amputation was performed for epithelioma of the hand and forearm. A second amputation, which was at the shoulder-joint, was performed nine weeks after the first, for a recurrence of the disease in the axillary glands. The man died soon after the second operation. The brachial artery, which is injected, is seen to tail off into fibrous tissue (green rod) below its last branch. The calibre of the vessel is not much altered in the greater part of its course. The main nerves have apparently been shortened at the operation. The cut end of the median nerve is -slightly bulbous, and a filament from it passes in front of the artery. The end of the ulnar nerve is only slightly enlarged. A rod is passed below the ends of both the ulnar and median nerves. The end of the musculo-spiral nerve is not enlarged. A thick pad of subcutaneous tissue covers the end of the bone, which has been sawn up. The fibres of the supinator radii longus muscle are seen to run into fibrous tissue below. G. C. 2793.

Stump after Amputation at "the Seat of Elec- tion."—Sections of tibia and corresponding part of fibula of the above amputation—soft parts dissected, in spirit. The amputation was performed for sarcoma of the leg, which had attacked an ulcer. There was no return at the stump, but the patient died of deposits of sarcoma in the brain, heart, and lungs.—See No. 9.66. The end of the bone is covered by skin only. All the structures end in fibrous tissue. There are no enlargements of the ends of the nerves. G. C. 2817. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E., 1888. 11. 85.

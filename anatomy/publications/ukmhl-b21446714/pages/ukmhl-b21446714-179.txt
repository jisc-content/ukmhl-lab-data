Fractures of the Tibia and Fibula. 147 the Fibula higher up.—Eight tibia and fibula—macerated, showing the above. As in the previous specimen, the tibia has been, broken at the junction of the lower and middle thirds, and the fibula at the junction of its two upper fourths. The broken ends of the tibia are set at an angle, which projects slightly forwards. The obliquity of the fracture of the tibia is the same as in the last specimen. In the fibula the direction of the break is difficult to trace, owing to irregularities at the seat of fracture. The overlapping of the fragments is less than in the previous sPecimen- B. 0. I. 1. M. 34. 3. 290. United Fracture of the Tibia near the Ankle-Joint, and of the Fibula about the Middle—Right tibia and fibula—macerated, showing the above. The line of fracture in the tibia is oblique from the outer and posterior part of the bone downwards, inwards, and forwards. In both bones the fragments overlap, and form an angle directed slightly forwards. The fibula at the seat of fracture has, more- over, been pressed towards the tibia. The grooves for tendons, at the lower end of both bones, are increased in depth, probably from chronic congestion. j> p c 17§ Presented by Professor John Thomson. FRACTURES OF THE TIBIA. {Some of these have probably been indirect fractures of both bones, as the line of obliquity corresponds to that seen in such specimens.) 3.291. United Fracture of the Shaft about the Middle -Lower two-thirds of a right tibia-macerated, showing the above. ° The bone was divided longitudinally, but the condition of the interior is obscured by adipocere. The bone has evidently been comminuted, and the lower fragment is rotated inwards. B. C. i. 1. M. 46. d

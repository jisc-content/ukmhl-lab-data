184 Injuries of Bone. and has apparently necrosed, for it is in process of separation. Near the necrosed portions there is much thickening by develop- ment of new bone in the extremity of the lower piece, even down to the knee-joint. G- C. 3529. 3. 397. United Fracture of the Femur of a Small Quad- ruped.—Eight and left femur of a small quadruped—macerated. The right bone is thickened over its whole extent, and the sharp ledge formed in its upper third is evidently due to fracture at that point. G- C- 3530- 3. 398. United Fracture of the Spine of a Cat.-Part of the spine of a cat—macerated. The specimen shows great alteration from the above injury. At one place the bodies of the vertebrae have been completely dislocated, and their ends overlap. Much new bone has been thrown out in the neighbourhood. The spinal cord must have been completely torn across. G- C- 353L Presented by Dr Abeeceomby. 3 399. Lodging- of a Bullet in the Femur of a Deer.- Lower end of the right femur of a red deer—macerated, show- in- a round bullet, and the condition of the surrounding bone. From the fact that round bullets had been disused for many years before the animal was killed, also from the appear- ance of the parts, the bullet must have lain in its position for a long time. Except for the original injury, the bullet must have caused the animal very little inconvenience. There is some irregularity of bone in the neighbourhood, but no appearance of any chronic irritation.

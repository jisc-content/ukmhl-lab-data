Necrosis from Scjrtie Wounds. 271 a crust of new periosteal bone is seen in patches up the shaft. The cause of the septic condition is obscure—possibly a compound fracture of the tibia. B. C. I. 5. M. 25. d. Where the chief changes are in the form of necrosis or death of a palpable portion. (a.) Where the dead piece has been in process of separation. 6.173. Septic Osteo-myelitis following- Compound Frac- ture — Necrosis.—Section of an injected tibia — muscles dissected off and in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient died of erysipelas and tetanus about two months after the fracture. " Necrosis took place, and the limits of the dead portion are marked by bristles." The fragments have not been in good position. The broken ends are united by fibrous tissue. There is considerable thickening round about. B. C. i. 1. M. 45. 6. 174. Septic Osteo-myelitis and Necrosis following- Gun- shot (Compound) Fracture.—Portion of the shaft of a femur—macerated, illustrating the above. The wound was received at the battle of Waterloo. The fracture has been comminuted, and the broken ends are irregular. The surface of the dead pieces is smooth and unchanged. There are marks of rarefactive ostitis beyond the dead parts, and a trench separates them from the living bone in the usual way. p. p. C. 218. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 6. 175.

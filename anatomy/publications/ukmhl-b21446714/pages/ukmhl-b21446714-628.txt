The foot had become gangrenous from constriction, and had separated by natural processes at the lower epiphyseal lines of the tibia and fibula. G. C. 3140.

The patient was a mill girl, whose hand had been severely crushed by machinery. The injured hand was treated by immersion in an antiseptic bath, and septic fermentation was entirely obviated. The finger was removed several days after the injury by clipping through some remaining tags of skin and tendon. Q c< nQ2 Presented by D. A. Carrtjthers, M.D., 1888. 11. 77. Traumatic Gangrene, complicated by Sepsis.— Gelatine and glycerine cast of a right leg and foot, illustrating the above. The patient, a strong labourer, had his foot crushed by the fall of a heavy stone, and he was admitted to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on the same night. The next morning the foot was cold, and gangrene was feared. By the fourth morning after the accident, gangrene of the foot had become pronounced, and as it seemed to be spreading up the leg, ampu- tation was performed above the knee. The patient made a good recovery. The tissues in the foot were decomposing. The posterior tibial artery was found to be ruptured, the soft parts much bruised, and the os calcis crushed, while there was a severe Pott's fracture of the fibula with wrenching off of the inner malleolus. See No. 3, 313. The cast shows the discolouration of the foot, the blebs which appeared, and the peeling off of the epidermis. Above the ankle there were several blebs and much discolouration. Tnis, it was feared, showed advancing gangrene, but it may have been due only to extensive extravasation. G. C. 2850. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E.

Diseases of Bone. 376 4th April Mr Duncan amputated the leg at the knee-joint, and the patient made a good recovery. In most parts the marginal bone lias been reduced to a mere shell. Below and near the outer tuberosity the tumour substance is invading the healthy-looking bone, but with very little infiltration. When fresh, the tumour had the characteristic appearance of a myeloid sarcoma. At one spot, i.e. below the crucial liga- ments, there was some greyish sarcomatous-looking substance, but all the rest was like blood-clot, crimson, orange, and yellow in colour, as if in varying stages of decolorisation. These appearances are now much altered by the action of the spirit. The blow had evidently broken the fibula, and seems to have splintered the tibia.

Mrs T aged 62, was admitted to Chalmers Hospital in October 1890 She had been healthy until the present tumour began, about ten years before. The first symptom was pain over the head of the right fibula This was followed by swelling in the neighbourhood winch increased gradually at first, but rapidly for the last twelve months. On admission the tumour surrounded the leg completely m its upper two- thirds. Tbe maximum circumference of the tumour was twenty-two inches. The skin over it was tense, and the veins were dilated. To the touch it felt mostly firm and fibrous; it was fluctuating and apparently cystic in places, with a few calcareous masses perceptible in the walls of the cysts. Amputation was performed through the lower third of the thigh in October 1890, and the patient made a good recovery.

498 Diseases of Joints. •and neck of the femur are wanting at their normal place, and ;a flat surface on the femur indicates where the neck should have joined it. The outer surface of the bone which fills the acetabulum has evidently rubbed against the site of the neck, for although the opposite surfaces are for the most part porous, they each have patches of eburnation. There are no appearances at the line of junction of the head and acetabulum which would indicate anchylosis from arthritis deformans before the fracture. For a comparatively recent example of a detached head lying in the acetabulum, see No. 3. 184. G. C. 1849. Presented byV. D. Handyside, F.R.C.S.E., 1837. SHOULDER-JOINT. 7. 183. Advancing- Arthritis Deformans of the Shoulder, with Absorption of the Tendon of the Biceps.— Upper half of the right humerus of an old person, cleaned of all soft parts, except some of those attached to the bicipital groove, and dried, illustrating the above. The biceps tendon, at its upper end, is represented by a bollow tube, attached to the upper part of the bicipital groove. The articular surface seems fairly normal, but there is some enlargement at the articular margin. G. C. 3477. Presented by Professor John Struthers. 7. 184. Advancing-Arthritis Deformans of the Shoulder, with Absorption of the Tendon of the Bieeps.- Upper end of the left humerus of an old person, cleaned of all soft parts, except those attached to the bicipital groove, and dried, illustrating the above. The tendon of the biceps is somewhat diminished in size, and has been adherent in front to the lesser tuberosity. There is considerable irregularity round the articular margin of the bone, especially at the upper part. G. C. 3477. Presented by Professor John Struthers.

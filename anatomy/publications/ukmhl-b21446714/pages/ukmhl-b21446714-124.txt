92 Injuries of Bone. above the lower end, is brought near the ulna. The articular surface for the carpus looks slightly backwards, and the styloid process has been displaced upwards. These alterations resemble those found in Colles' fracture, which, however, is usually at a lower level. The ulna at its lower end is bent away from the radius, and its styloid process projects unduly. G. C. 2785. Presented by Johnson Symington, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 132a. Structure and Arrangement of Parts concerned in Colles' Fracture.—Skeleton of a left hand and wrist, and sections of a left radius, to illustrate the above. G. C. 3271. Presented by Johnson Symington, F.R.C.S.E. 3. 133. Recent Compound Colles' Fracture.-Right hand and forearm of a young woman—in spirit, with the tendons dissected at the back, to illustrate the above. The patient while drunk had heen tripped up on the street. Acute septic inflammation ensued, and was followed by spreading gangrene, for which amputation through the upper arm became necessary. For many days after the amputation her life was in danger, but she ultimately made a good recovery. The wound made by the lower end of the ulna is shown in front, The lower end of the radius has been comminuted and the styloid process of the ulna broken off. G. C. 3271. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.R.C.S.E. 134. Badly united Colles' Fracture.—Skeleton of the left forearm of an old person—cleaned and dried, showing the above. The radius has been fractured about half an inch above its lower end; the carpal articular surface has been forced back- wards and upwards, and looks obliquely backwards. Its styloid process is now on a level with that of the ulna. The carpus and lower fragment of the radius thus project

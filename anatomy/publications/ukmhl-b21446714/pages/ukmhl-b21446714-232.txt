Diseases of Bone. 200 6. 3. Imperfect Development of the Arch of the Atlas. —Atlas vertebra from an adult—macerated, illustrating the above. The bone seems well developed, except that the arch is incomplete on the right side, near its junction with the lateral G. C. 992. mass. 6. 4. Cervical Rib.—Eight first rib of an adult, with an extra rib fused to it—macerated. The first rib itself has a ridge for the attachment of the scalenus anticus muscle, with a groove in front and behind it. The ridge separating these two grooves runs in the direction of the extra rib. The extra rib has a well-marked head, neck, and tubercule, with about one inch of a body, before it blends with the first rib. The place of junction is much flattened, and on the inner side is prolonged into a flattened spike, directed forwards and inwards. G. C. 35 II. CHANGES PRODUCED BY CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE NUTKITION OF BONE. A. Changes in old age. 6. 5 Change in the Humerus from Old Age-Upper end of a right humerus, in section-macerated, to show the above. The bone was very greasy, and was with difficulty cleaned of fat and oil. The compact tissue of the shaft is diminished in thickness. There is considerable atrophy of the cancellous tissue at the upper end, and the whole texture of the bone is lighter and more friable than in the adult condition The changes in this bone may be taken as characteristic of those found in the long bones of old people, when semle^ias appeared.

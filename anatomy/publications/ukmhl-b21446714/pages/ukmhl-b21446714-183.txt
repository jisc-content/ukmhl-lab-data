151 Fractures into the Ankle-Joint. and at other places the broken surface has been smoothed over. The vascular pores are enlarged over the greater part of the surface. The fracture has probably been compound. B. C. i. 1. M. 46. k. FRACTURES INTO THE ANKLE-JOINT. (a.) Involving chiefly the Tibia. 3. 304. Comminuted and Splitting Fracture of the Tibia, involving the Ankle-joint.—Lower half of a right tibia- macerated, showing the above. The fracture has begun about six .inches" above the joint, and has run down in an irregularly spiral manner into the lower end, the fissures meeting one another, so that portions of the bone have become detached. There are marks of periosteal activity on the fragments Apparently, therefore, the fracture has been compound, and amputation has been performed a few weeks after the injury. G. C. 175. b. 3. 305. Fracture of the Tibia, involving- the Ankle-joint —Comparatively recent.—Inner half of a section of the lower end of a left tibia, astragalus, and os calcis—muscles dissected off—in spirit, showing the above. The line of fracture has passed from above and behind downwards and forwards, and seems to have just reached the ankle-joint. The lower fragment of the tibia is displaced back- wards. The broken surfaces of the cancellous tissue and adjacent periosteum seem to be infiltrated with recent lymph. G. C. 3305. 3. 306. Comminuted Fracture of the Lower End of the Tibia, involving the Ankle-joint.—Lower ends of a

Tubercular Ostitis involving Anhle-joint. 469 —Section of the left foot of a woman—in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient, aged 43, was delicate and nervous, and had previously ■suffered from suppurating cervical glands. A tubercular abscess had formed in the lower end of the tibia (No. 6. 212), which was opened and ■scraped. Fourteen days afterwards the pain settled in the ankle, and .amputation became necessary. The specimen shows tubercular affection of the synovial membrane, extending over the upper surface of the astragalus and attacking the cartilage. Although the disease in this case was primarily in the bone, this specimen has been placed among the synovial membrane affections, because it shows the disease there only. G. C. 2836. Presented by Charles "W. Cathcart, F.E.C.S.E. 7. 111. Tubercular Synovitis involving- Cartilage and Bone.—Bones forming a right ankle-joint " from a negro boy " —injected with vermilion, and in spirit. The joint is exposed from the front by a section of the tibia, which is turned down. The articular surfaces of the ankle-joint, and especially those of the astragalus, are covered with a flocculent vascular membrane, to which the sound cartilage on the under surface of the astragalus forms a striking contrast. There is a cavity in the inner side of the tibia above the malleolus, which is lined by vascular granulations. A portion of the skin below this has been left to show sinuses which must have opened into the joint, and by which no doubt, sepsis had entered to complicate the tuberculosis. B. C. n. M. 35. 7.112.

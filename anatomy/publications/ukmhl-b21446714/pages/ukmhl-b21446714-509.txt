Tubercular Synovitis of Elbow-joint. 477 7. 133. Tubercular Synovitis involving- the Articular Surface.—Upper end of a right ulna—macerated, illustrating the above. The cartilaginous surfaces of the greater and lesser sigmoid cavities have been for the most part rarefied, leaving only a narrow margin of cartilage round the top of the greater sigmoid cavity. F. P. C. 369. 7. 134. Tubercular Synovitis, involving- the Articular Surface.—Upper end of a left ulna—macerated, illustrating the above. There is rarefaction of the articular surfaces, especially of the lesser sigmoid cavity. New bone has been thrown out below the joint. G. C. 1149. Presented by Professor James Russell. 7. 135. Tubercular Synovitis involving the Articular Surface.—Portions of a left elbow-joint removed by excision —macerated, illustrating the above. When fresh, the articular surfaces were in many parts covered with pulpy gelatinous material. At other places, soft gelatinous material (granulation tissue) had spread between the bone and the cartilage, and was absorbing it from below. The cartilage, however, was not loose, as it still adhered to the gelatinous material. On the articular surface of the humerus, two hard white nodules of bone stood out from the surrounding granulations. At the outer side there was a cavity entirely filled with gray gelatinous material, becoming caseous at various points. The articular surface of the ulna presented a similar appearance. The articular surfaces are rarefied, and show the deep holes which were filled with the gelatinous granulation material.

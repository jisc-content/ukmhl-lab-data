509 Tumours of Joints. the bone is not eaten away, spicules and plates of new bone are thrown out from the surface, as in many of the specimens of sarcoma in Series 6. The upper end of the fibula is bent out- wards from the tibia, and there is a space between it and the tibia, which has evidently been occupied by a mass of the tumour. Plates of new bone appear to grow from the fibula at the front of the head, but it is more probable that they are part of the original tibial tumour here pressed against the fibula, and dried in situ.

The joint had been enormously enlarged owing to the growth of a tumour, which on the outer side has burst through the skin, and fungated in large masses. This has apparently been a sarcoma of the soft parts near the joint, which it has enveloped in its growth. F. P. C. 758. See also Nos. 6. 402-404. 7. 207. Sarcoma (?) involving- the Carpal Bones. —Left wrist and metacarpal bones injected, and partially dissected— in spirit, illustrating the above. This specimen is thus described by Benjamin Bell in his treatise on "Diseases of Bones," pp. 160,161 :—" The blood in this case was contained in numerous distinct bony cysts, each of which was lined by a highly vascular membrane. The blood also was fluid, and had not concreted in the manner described by M. Breschet and myself. There was no pulsa- tion in the tumour previous to the amputation of the hand, and on beiu"- punctured, it discharged dark-coloured blood." This disease has involved the carpal bones and joints, and seems to consist of smooth lined cysts, surrounded by a very vascular substance j probably a cystic sarcoma. G. C. 319.

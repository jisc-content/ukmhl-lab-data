Diseases of Bone. 248 separation may be specially studied on the large fragment in front. There the vascular granulations which have separated it from the living stand out as a deep red line all round and below it. A similar process may be observed, only less distinctly, in connection with the other smaller fragments marked by bristles. The periosteum has formed a crust of new bone around the original shaft, except opposite the large necrosed fragment, where it has probably been itself destroyed. W. C. G. 25. 6. 106. Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis and Periostitis of the Tibia—Necrosis.—Section of the lower half of the same tibia as the last—injected and mounted in spirit to illus- trate the above. Some of the original cancellated tissue is seen in the interior. Outside this, and marked by bristles, there are necrosed portions of the original compact tissue, and beyond that again there is a thick layer of newly formed periosteal bone. This is irregular on the surface, and shows at one place a cloacal aperture for the escape of pus from the neighbourhood of the dead bone. W. C. G. 24. 6. 107. Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis and Periostitis Of the Tibia—Necrosis.—Wax cast of a leg, illustrating the above. This cast was figured in Kussell on "Necrosis," published in 1794, plate v. fig. 1. The wax was apparently not changed at all as yet (1893). G. C. 1177. Presented by Professor James Kussell. 6. 108. Acute Suppurative Osteo-myelitis of the Tibia and Femur—Necrosis.—Plaster cast of the inside of the thigh and leg of a young person, showing the above.

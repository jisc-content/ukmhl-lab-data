A natomy of Stumps. 601 The muscles are all atrophied, but the gastro-cnemius is the least so, and the soleus is next to it. The posterior tibial artery is smaller in proportion than the posterior tibial nerve, which has no bulbous ending. The os calcis has either been at first partly left, or has since been partly re-formed. The bone re- presenting it is separated from the tibia, partly by fibrous tissue, and partly by a false joint.

Stump after a Syme or Pirogoff's Amputation.— Fibula and a small piece of the tibia, •with a portion of the bone representing the os calcis, from the previous case—in spirit. An atrophied tendo-Achillis is attached to a fragment of the os calcis, and between this bone and the bones of the leg there is an appearance of cartilage in the newly formed joint. G. C. 2798. a: Presented by Professor T. Annandale, 1887. 11. 90. Stump of a Femur a Year after Amputation.—Por- tion of the femur—macerated, illustrating the above. The original operation^ was performed at the Military Hospital, at Portsea. "Whether a secondary amputation was required, or whether the patient died from other causes, is uncertain, but from the appearance of the stump the latter seems more probable. The end of the bone is somewhat rounded off, but the extremity has not been covered in. F. P. C. 229. 11. 91. Stump of a Femur long after Amputation.—Small piece of bone—macerated, illustrating the above. The secondary amputation was performed on account of "irritable stump " (i.e. enlargement and painful condition of the ends of the nerves). The bone is greatly atrophied, and its extremity rounded

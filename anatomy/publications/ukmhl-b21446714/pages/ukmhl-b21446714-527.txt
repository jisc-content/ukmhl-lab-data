Arthritis Deformans of Sip-joint. 495 7. 179. Advanced Arthritis Deformans.—Posterior half of the having, on the whole, a somewhat square shape, with rounde d angles. The surface departed from the spherical. The depression forming the pit and groove for the round ligament was compressed so as to form a mere fissure, elongated verti- cally." (Struthers, Edin. Med. Journal, Jan. 1863.) The absorption of the top of the heads, the irregularity of the articular surfaces, and the prolongation of their margins are changes found in arthritis deformans. The shape of the altered head is not quite characteristic, hut a constant cross- legged position at his work might perhaps account for the peculiarity in this case. The symmetry is remarkable. G.

Advanced Arthritis Deformans of the Hip-joint, with Enlargement, Absorption, and Locking-.—Bones forming a left hip-joint—macerated, illustrating the above. There has been so much enlargement round the lower part of the articular margin of the femur, and so much absorption of the upper part of the head, that the tissue of the head seems as if it had been moulded roughly downwards, while the great trochanter has been proportionately raised. The new bone at the articular margin is very craggy and irregular, and the portion of bone which was in contact with the acetabulum is porous, and but very slightly eburnated, probably because the irregularity of the surfaces locked the joint, and permitted none but a very slight movement. The anchylosis has been in the flexed position. The acetabulum is enlarged round the margin, and the interior is rough and porous, with only a very slight degree of eburnation here and there. The muscular attachments on the ischium are rough. G. C. 2775. Presented by Macdonald Brown, F.R.C.S.E.

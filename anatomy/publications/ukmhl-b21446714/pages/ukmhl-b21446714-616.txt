The Limbs as a Whole. 584 The metatarsal bone is directed downwards and inwards, and the two form an angle at the metatarsal phalangeal joint, which is itself considerably enlarged and projects inwards. G. C. 3519. 11. 47. Knock-knee and Talipes Varus.—Bones forming the skeleton of the lower limbs of an elderly person—macerated, illustrating the above. The deformity has been much more pronounced on the left side. The upper ends of both femora show similar changes. The angle of the neck approaches a right angle in each case. The shaft is unusually straight, and a ridge of bone is prolonged from the spiral line along the inner side. The articular surfaces are normal. On the left side the shaft from the junction of the middle and lower thirds downwards has the appearance of having been bent outwards, and the inner condyle has projected markedly downwards. Part of the surface of the inner condyle has been injured in the process of maceration, but enough remains to show that its contour has been rounded. The contour of the outer condyle, on the other hand, is flat, as if the bone had been compressed. The articular surface of the outer condyle is irregular, and the margins show an overgrowth of bone, such as is seen in arthritis deformans. This latter change is seen also on the lower end of the right femur, which, however, may otherwise be considered as normal. The tibiee, and especially the left, are both altered towards the upper end by a twisting of the head of the bone inwards upon the shaft. In addition, on the left side the outer tuberosity has sunk markedly down, and the articular margins have irregular projections, The upper part of the shaft is distorted by an apparent flattening from before backwards. The fibulae have been bent forward at the lower end, and twisted with the tibia at the upper. The margins of the outer maleoli are irregular, and the grooves for the

Diseases of Joints. 424- SERIES 7. DISEASES OF JOINTS. I. ABNORMALITIES IN GROWTH OR DEVELOPMENT. 7. 1. Congenital Anchylosis of the Superior Radio-ulnar Joint.—Eight radius and ulna—macerated, illustrating the above. The bones are in the position of complete pronation. The upper end of the radius is fused with the adjacent part of the ulna, the head of the radius being represented by a small knot projecting from the outer side of the greater sigmoid cavity. There has therefore been no capitellar surface, and probably no capitellum. The bones are separated below. The shaft of the ulna is thin, and its bony ridges are sharp and not in their usual position. This specimen is stated to have been taken from a child. From this fact, as well as from the absence of indication of previous disease, it has been considered a congenital mal- formation. B. C. n. M. 52. II. CHANGES PRODUCED BY CONDITIONS AEFECTING THE NUTRITION OF JOINTS. 7. 2. Degeneration of Cartilage in Old Age.—Patella and rectus femoris tendon from an old person—in spirit, illustrating the above. The central portion of the articular cartilage of the patella is broken up into fibrillse, which resemble the pile of velvet.

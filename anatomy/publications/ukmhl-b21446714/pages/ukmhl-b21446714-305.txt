Necrosis from Septic Wounds. 273 6. 179. Septic Osteo-myelitis and Necrosis following- Compound Fracture.—Lower two-thirds of the shaft of th left tibia of a boy (epiphysis wanting)—macerated, illustrating the above. There is a necrosed portion at the upper end. in process of separation. Some new periosteal bone has been thrown out on the shaft below. B. C. i. 5. M. 24. 6. 180. Septic Osteo-myelitis and Necrosis following* Compound Fracture. — Greater part of a broken tibia —fragments wired together—and lower end of fibula— macerated, illustrating the above. The greater portion of the upper fragment of the tibia is irregularly pitted on the surface, and apparently has been in process of separation from the rest. A mass of irregular bone,, chiefly of new formation, lies on the outer side between the twa fragments. Near the seat of fracture the lower fragment has new bone developed on its anterior and inner aspects, but not behind. The fragment of the fibula shows an area of necrosis at the seat of fracture, and a slight periosteal crust below. Figured in Eussell on "Necrosis," plate vi. G. C. 1184. .181. Septic Osteo-myelitis and Necrosis of the Humerus after Amputation—Pyaemia—Death.—Sections of the upper half of a humerus—partially macerated, and in spirit, to illustrate the above. The patient was a man aged 21, whose forearm forms the specimen No. 6. 111. He died of pyaemia after amputation above the elbow. The greater part of the shaft has necrosed, and over the surface of this part, but separate from it, a thin shell of new periosteal bone has been formed. It may be noted that the granulations on the deep or inner surface of this new shell have attacked the outer surface of the necrosed shaft. The upper end of the shaft is rarefied, and has evidently been S

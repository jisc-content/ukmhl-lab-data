Stump of a Syme's Amputation, affected by Tuberculosis.—Section of the tibia and soft parts of a left leg—injected with carmine, and in spirit, illustrating the above. The foot was amputated for tubercular disease of the ankle-joint. A re-amputation became necessary on account of return of the disease in the bone and soft parts. In the heel flap is seen a large abscess cavity, lined by Granulations. In the interior of the tibia a condition of chronic tubercular osteo-myelitis tending to caseation is seen to have spread upwards from the sawn surface. G. C. 2872. Presented by P. H.

Since, however the linea aspera 1S in line with the head, this must have been a misprint for everted. The neck has given way, as usual, at its junction with the trochanters, and these, in turn, have been detached from the shaft and severely comminuted by the impaction. There has been no union, but new periosteal bone has been formed round the upper part of the shaft and on the fragments of the trochanters. The neck shows some erosion, but no new bone G.

The neck has given way at the usual place, and its anterior broken border is in front of the upper end of the shaft. The upper and back part of the great trochanter and the lesser trochanter have been detached in one piece from the top of the shaft. The axis of the neck is horizontal. There has been an unusually great shortening, but very little rotation either way. The greater part of the head and adjacent neck have been ^^till be observed that while there is much new periosteal bone upon the upper part of the shaft, there is much less upon

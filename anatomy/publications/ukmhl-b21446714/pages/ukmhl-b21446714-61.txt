Development of the Bones of the Upper Limb. 29 2. 57. Ossification in the Bones of the Forearm.—Bones of the right forearm of a young person, said to be 15 years old— macerated and dried—to show the epiphyses. In the radius at the lower end an epiphysis forms the carpal articular surface and the styloid process, and at the upper end a small plate of bone (lost in this specimen) forms the articular surface with the humerus. On the ulna an epiphysis forms the styloid process and the lower articular surface, while at the upper end there is a small epiphysis for the olecrannon. G. C. 3539. Presented by Charles "W. Cathcart, F.K.C.S.E., 1893. 2. 58. Development of Forearm.—Ulna of a child—injected and in spirit. The epiphyses are shown as in the previous specimen. 2. 59. Development Of Hand.—Skeleton of the hand of a fcetus between the fifth and sixth month—in turpentine. There is only one point of ossification in the carpus. The metacarpal bones and all the phalanges of the thumb and first three fingers show centres of ossification, but in the little finger there is a centre of ossification in the first phalanx only. B. C. 1. TS. 97. 2. 60. Development Of Hand.—Skeleton of the hand and part of the forearm of a fcetus about the sixth month—injected and in turpentine. One centre of ossification is seen in the carpus and also in the metacarpal bone and phalanges of the thumb and all the fing«rs- B. C. ]. N. 95. ^. 61.

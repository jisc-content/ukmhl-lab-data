The fibula shows new periosteal bone formation all over. The outer surface of the patella is also very irregular, from new bone formation. This has probably been a very chronic tubercular affection, with numerous septic sinuses. F. P. C. 398. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 6. 234. Tubercular and Septic Disease of the Lower End of the Tibia.—Lower end of a left tibia and fibula—macerated, illustrating the above. The leg was amputated for extensive disease of the ankle-joint. The lower half of the tibia shows some new periosteal bone on the surface, with erosion* and destruction in the interior. The irregular erosions so often seen in tubercular disease are especially noteworthy about four inches above the ankle. The articular end seems to^have been necrotic, but is also very irregular. The fibula has irregular new bone formation on its surface. This has evidently been a tubercular case, complicated by septic changes. B c< % M 39 35. Tubercular and Septic Disease of Radius and Ulna.—Left radius and ulna—macerated, illustrating the above. The crust of new bone on the shafts seems to be the result of sepsis, but the irregular eating away of the crust, especially at the lower end of the ulna, where the original bone is also partly removed, has probably been due to tuberculosis.

Abnormalities of Bone. 199 SERIES 6. DISEASES OF BONE. I. ABNORMALITIES IN GROWTH OR DEVELOPMENT. 1. Abnormal Development of Skeleton.—Skeleton of an Anencephalic male foetus—macerated, showing the ahove. The cranial bones are imperfectly developed, and the vault of the skull is very shallow and quite deficient at the vertex. The parietal bones are feebly developed, while there is a large gap corresponding to the foramen magnum. There are six digits on each hand and foot, the extra one being super- numerary to the fifth in each case. In both hands the extra digit arises from the fifth metacarpal bone, which is unduly broad. A similar arrangement is seen on the left foot, but on the right foot the fifth metatarsal bone is double. The radius on each side is somewhat bent and flattened, and the tibiee are broad and somewhat bent. In other respects the skeleton seems well developed. q. q 3494 Presented by Alexis Thomson, F.E.C.S.E, 1893. • Abnormal Development of Skeleton—Three photo- graphs of the above foetus, showing the appearances presented before dissection. The relative shortness of the lower limbs and their some- what inverted position should be noted. The bloated appear- ance of the features in the front and side views is clearly demon- strated, and in the profile view the relative smallness of the cranium and the protrusion of brain and membranes through the vertex is well shown.

Injuries of Bone. 160 3. 328. Gunshot Fracture immediately below the Tro- chanter.—Upper end of a left femur—macerated, showing the above. The patient was a soldier who fought at "Waterloo. The fracture is an irregular one. A fissure runs up into the neck on the inner side, and another into the great tro- chanter on the outer side. From the commencing necrosis at the seat of fracture on the outer side, and from marks of inflam- mation at other places, there has evidently been suppuration for days or weeks after the injury. F.

The specimen is from a soldier who fought at Waterloo. The fracture has been irregular, and a fissure runs up upon the outer side. A portion of bone on the inner side at the seat of fracture has necrosed, and has been in process of separation. The rest of the bone has evidently been inflamed. F. P. C. 215. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 3 330. Gunshot Fracture of the Middle of the Shaft of the Femur.-Lower two-thirds of a right femur-macerated, showin* the above. The fragments are wired in position. All the portions were driven among the muscles. The man lay on the field of Waterloo several days. The bone has been severely comminuted for about four inches, but there are no fissures beyond the comminuted^ are. Roughness, due to periostitis, is visible over the whole of the If , and on the fragments as well. Smooth patches on the rag- ments and main part of shaft indicate necrosed pieces of bone which would have separated in time. The man must have lived many days, if not several weeks, before amputation was performed. B. C. xvn.

Tubercular Disease of the Spine. 523 ing falling forward of the upper parts of the canal, so as to drag the spinal cord against a projecting fragment of one of the lower vertebra?. This form of " pressure paralysis " due to spinal disease is not amenable to operative treatment unless indeed the upper part of the column could be replaced. It is sometimes, however, difficult, if not impossible, to recognise it before- hand. G. C. 3481. Presented by Professor T. Annandale, 1893. 7.233. Tubercular Disease, with Destruction of the Bodies. — Portions of six dorsal vertebras of a child — macerated, illustrating the above. The bodies of three of the vertebras have disappeared, while those of other two have been partially destroyed. In such a case the caseous matter and debris of bone are apt to be pressed back upon the cord. G. C. 1180. Presented by Professor James Russell. 7. 234. Tubercular Disease, with Extensive Destruction of the Bodies.—Left half of cervical and dorsal portions of the spine of a child—partially macerated and dried, illustrating the above. The bodies of the vertebras from the lower cervical to the tenth dorsal inclusive have been almost entirely destroyed. The spine has consequently been bent upon itself so much that the lower cervical vertebras must have been close down, upon the eleventh dorsal. The spinal canal has evidently been almost obliterated, and extensive paraplegia must have been the consequence. B. C. 1. 3. M. 57. 7.235. Tubercular Disease, with Destruction of the Bodies.—Lower four cervical and upper ten dorsal vertebra of a child—macerated, illustrating the above.

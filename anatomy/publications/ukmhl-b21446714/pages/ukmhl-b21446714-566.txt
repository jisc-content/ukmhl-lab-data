Diseases of Joints. 534- B. C. i. 4. M. 2. of a young person—macerated, and divided by a mesial section, showing the effect of tubercular disease in the lower dorsal and lumbar regions. The vertebra? affected are the last three dorsal and first three lumbar, which are now fused into an irregular mass. The spine is bent acutely forward in the upper dorsal regionr but the spinal canal has not been appreciably encroached upon, at least by bony matter. The portion of spine above the- disease, and what remains of it below the disease, has been curved with the convexity forwards, thus exaggerating the normal curves in the cervical and lumbar regions. By these- compensating curves the skull remains over the pelvis, and the face looks forwards. The ribs are greatly compressed, and the cavity of the thorax is diminished. The pelvis is kyphotic, and the angle between the neck of the femur and the shaft is very obtuse. B. C. I. 3. M. 64. and 65. 7. 256. Tubercular Disease leading- to Abscess.—Wax- covered plaster cast of tubercular disease of the spine, with lumbar abscess. B. C. I. 3. M. 55. 3. Where the inflammation is due to the poison of Syphilis. 7. 257. Syphilitic Softening- of Transverse Ligament of the Atlas—Dislocation—Death.—Anterior portions of the- upper three cervical vertebrae, partly dissected—in spirit, illustrating the above. " From a patient in the Lock Hospital, who had venereal sore-throat, and the ulceration extended to the spine. The atlas, falling forwards,, carried the spinal marrow against the tooth-like process, and crushed it. He died in an instant. See the Hospital Reports, pages 149, 469, and the Exposition (Bell) of the Nervous System, page 234." The softened remains- of the transverse ligament is shown on the right side.

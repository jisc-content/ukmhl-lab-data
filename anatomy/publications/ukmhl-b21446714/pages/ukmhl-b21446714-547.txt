515 Lateral Curvature of the Spine. places are partially anchylosed. The aorta is seen to follow the abnormal curves of the spine. G. C. 3205. Presented by Macdonald Buown, F.R.C.S.E. 7.218. Advanced Lateral Curvature of the Spine.— Dorsal and lumbar portion of the spine with pelvis—partly macerated, illustrating the above. A section was originally made of the preparation, but as the bone was found to be friable, it was considered best to replace the parts. There is a very extreme curve to the right in the mid- dorsal region, possibly due to tilting of the pelvis. The usual rotation of the bodies of the vertebra? to the convex side, with compression and anchylosis of parts iu the concavity, is well seen. The natural curves are obliterated. The pelvis is roomy and fairly natural, except that the iliac crests are flattened. 33. C. r. 3. M. 11 and 12. 7.219. Advanced Lateral Curvature, with Excessive Distortion.—Spinal column, thorax, and pelvis—macerated, illustrating the above. The patient, a man who lived to nearly the age of 50, died of apoplexy. There is an extremely acute lateral curve to the left in the lower dorsal region, with a compensating curve to the right in the upper dorsal region. The rotation of the vertebral bodies is so complete in the lower dorsal region that the front of some of them looks obliquely backwards. The usual increased projection of the angles of the ribs at the convexity, and flattening at the concavity, is so marked that the lower ribs on the left side are like flattened plates rolled round the bodies of the vertebra; while on the right side, they are nearly straight. The compressed parts in the concavity are in many cases anchylosed. Figured by Shaw « on Distortion," plate 4. 33. C. i. 3. M. 17. 7. 220. Lateral Curvature-Bone Chang*es.-Three anchy- losed dorsal vertebra, probably seventh, eighth, and ninth- macerated, illustrating the above.

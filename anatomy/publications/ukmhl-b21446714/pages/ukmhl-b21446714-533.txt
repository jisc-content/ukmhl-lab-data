Arthritis Deformans of Shoulder-joint. 501 7. 188. Advanced Arthritis Deformans, with Alteration of the Articular Surfaces.—Right humerus and scapula of an elderly person—macerated, illustrating the above. The articular surfaces are both flattened out, and the globular character of the head of the humerus has been quite lost. Round the articular margins of both bones there are numerous irregular outgrowths of bone. The bicipital groove is lost, there being only a shallow depression at the upper end to mark its former site. The shaft of the humerus is curved outwards at the attachment of the deltoid. The upper part of the greater tuberosity has been in contact with the acromion process, and the bony outgrowths on the glenoid cavity reach to the top of the coracoid process, There is little or no alteration on the lower articular surface of the humerus. There must have been considerable shortening of this arm. These appearances of the shoulder-joint are such as might have been artificially produced had the bones been softened to a putty-like consistence and then pressed together. G. C. 1193. a. Presented by Professor James Russell. 7. 189. Advanced Arthritis Deformans, with Alterations in the Shaft Of the Humerus.—Right humerus and scapula —macerated, illustrating the above. As in the previous preparation, the head and glenoid cavities have apparently been compressed and flattened against one another, and irregular masses of new bone formed round the articular surfaces fit more or less accurately into one another. The greater tuberosity, in this specimen also, reaches to the acromion process, and the upper part of the shaft of the humerus is very much altered. There is much irregular thickening at the level of the attachment of the deltoid, and at the lower part of the usual position of the bicipital groove there is an aperture leading into the bone which communicates inter- nally with the lower edge of the altered articular surface.

It is difficult to say now whether tbe disease began in the bone or the synovial membrane, probably the latter, from the mischief seeming to have spread equally to both articular surfaces. G. C. 109. Presented by Professor J. W. Turner. 7. 58. Invasion of Articular Surfaces from Tubercular Synovitis.—Upper end of a left tibia, partially destroyed by the above. The greater part of the outer tuberosity is wanting, and what remains of it has been deeply eroded. The rest of the articular surface is rarefied and eroded. The tubercle and adjacent portions of the bone have disappeared. There is a slight periosteal crust round what remains of the tuberosities. . G. C. 753. Presented by Professor John Thomson. 7. 59.

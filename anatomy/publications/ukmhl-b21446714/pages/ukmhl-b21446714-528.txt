Diseases of Joints. 496 vertical transverse section of a left femur and adjacent part of pelvis—macerated, illustrating the above. The limb has evidently been fixed in a strongly adducted position, for the lesser trochanter has been atrophied by pressure against the lower part of the acetabulum. This is evident when the bones are placed in situ. They have, however, been mounted separately, to show the condition of the articular surfaces. There is some enlargement round the head of the bone, and considerable absorption on its top and inner sides. The surfaces of the femur and acetabulum which were in close contact are very porous, and have little or no eburnation, pro- bably because only limited movement was permitted by the altered shape of the bones. There is considerable roughening at the point of attachment of the quadratus femoris to the femur. The acetabulum shows the usual irregular enlargement round the margin, with a facette at the front of the cotyloid notch, where it was pressed upon by the lesser trochanter. The section shows some condensation of the head and neck of the femur, with a small cavity near the articular margin above. G. C. 921 a. Presented by Adam Huntek, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 180. Advanced Arthritis Deformans.—Anterior half of the vertical transverse section of the previous specimen—in spirit. It will be noted that there is a distinct thick layer of cartilage on what, in the macerated specimen, seems to be an enlargement downwards of the head. The presence of cartilage upon this piece of bone, so far removed in position from that of any part of the original head, can only be accounted for in one or other of two ways. Either this is a new layer of cartilage which has formed upon new bone, or it is some of the original cartilage adhering to a portion of the original head of the bone, which has been displaced bodily downwards. As articular cartilage is seldom,

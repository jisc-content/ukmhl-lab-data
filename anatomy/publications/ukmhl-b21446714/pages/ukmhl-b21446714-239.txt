Atrophy of Bone. 207 absent in the scapula, metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges. The bones on the right side are also less in girth than those on the left. The changes in the ends of the bones, resulting from the deformities acquired in early life, are met with both on the right and on the left side, though much more pronounced in these of the former or paralysed side. They reach their acme in the lower extremities. The right hip-joint presents a complete dorsal dislocation of the head of the femur, with corresponding changes in the articular surfaces; at the left side the dislocation is only partial. The right knee-joint is flexed to such a degree that the articular surf aces of the condyles are not in contact with the tibia; the facets of the latter are in contact with the superior aspect of the posterior extremities of either condyle. On the left side the flexion is less pronounced and the leg is rotated outwards. The right ankle-joint was acutely;flexed, remarkable—seeing that the toes of paralysed limbs are usually pointed: the superior surface of the neck of the astragalus articulated with the anterior aspect of the shaft of the tibia. On the left side the toes were pointed. In the upper extremities there are no evidences in the articular ends of the bones of the large joints of the contracture deformities on the right side, corresponding to those in the lower extremity. The articular surfaces remain in contact with each other, and are covered with hyaline cartilage. The hand, however, on the right side, preserved in its original conditions, presents the usual features of hemiplegic contracture. The brain.—See nervous system.

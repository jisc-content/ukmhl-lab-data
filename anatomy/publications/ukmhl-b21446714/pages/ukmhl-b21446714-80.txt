Trephining- for Fracture and Meningeal Haemor- rhage.—Portions cut out by the trephine from the skull of a boy 14 years old, by Mr Wilson. "He had been thrown from a horse about two hours before I saw him. He was taken home insensible, and remained so until the operation. Finding the bone fractured, and a very copious haemorrhage flowing from the fractured part, I immediately applied the trephine, and having thus made an opening and scooped out the coagulated blood, I found that the bleeding came from the principal artery of the dura mater, nearer the basis of the skull than could be got at without destroying life. I was obliged to apply the crown of the trephine seven times before I could remove all that pressed upon the brain. An hour after the operation the boy rallied and recovered without experiencing a single bad symptom in the cure. The operation was performed in 1792. In 1807 I saw him quite well, but the whole of the bone had not regenerated." The under surface of the pieces removed by the trephine show impressions of the middle meningeal artery. As several of the circles are broken, the fracture must have traversed this region. B. C. 1. 2. M. 13. 3. 24.

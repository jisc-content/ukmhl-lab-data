Diseases of Joints. 462 indicates the direction of the sinus which has evidently heen due to some tubercular synovial membrane left above the patella at the time of the excision. G. C. 2790. Presented by P. H. MacLaren, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 92. Return of Disease after Excision of the Knee.— Section of the left knee-joint of a young person—in spirit, illustrating the above. The knee-joint was excised for tubercular disease, but owing to the persistence of discharging sinuses, amputation was performed. The destruction of part of the adjacent portions of the femur and tibia by tubercular granulations is well shown. The line of union is fibrous, and has been progressing well. G. C. 3299. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 93. Return of Disease after Excision of the Knee.— Outer half of the previous specimen—macerated. The preparation shows the eroded state of the adjacent parts of the tibia and femur, the disease having in each case burrowed along the track of the steel pins which were inserted, and retained for six weeks, in order to steady the bones. G. C. 3300. Presented by A. G. Miller, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 94. Non-union after Excision of the Knee-joint.—Section of a knee-joint after excision—in spirit, illustrating the above. There is a wide fibrous union of the two bones, and a tubercular focus in the upper end of the tibia. G. C. 2452.

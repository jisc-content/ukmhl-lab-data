'Tubercular Arthritis subsiding. 453 light, the interior being rarefied and absorbed. There has been little or no new bone formed on the shaft. The shafts of both femur and tibia are unduly straight, a change seen in very chronic cases with anchylosis in the flexed position. F. P. C. 776. 7. 70. Invasion of Articular Surfaces, Tubercular Arth- ritis Subsiding.—Lower end of a left femur, illustrating the above. The lower end of the bone is straighter and lighter than usual, the articular surface is irregular, rarefied, and eroded in many places, and partly absorbed, but the surface has apparently been injured during maceration. This probably has been a case where anchylosis had taken place in the flexed position, with partial cure of the disease. F. P. C. 397. 7. 71. Tubercular Arthritis, subsiding".—Lower end of a left femur of a young person—macerated, showing changes, chiefly in the outer condyle. The bone as a whole is lightened, and the shaft is unduly straight. There is great irregularity from erosion and absorption on the articular surface of the outer condyle, especially towards the back. The trochlear surface is also somewhat irregular. There is some erosion on the back of the inner condyle, and an excavation on the shaft above the back of the outer condyle. No new periosteal bone has been formed. There seems to have been more or less anchylosis in the flexed position, with some tendency to cure. G. C. 3464. 7. 72. Tubercular Arthritis, with great Loss of Bone, subsiding.—Lower end of the right femur of a young person— macerated, with loss of the outer condyle.

Diseases of Connective Tissue. 554 At the operation, Dr Joseph Bell easily dissected out the lower scrotal part along with the testicle. The upper part, however, had penetrated into the ahdomen and involved the peritoneum, part of which was cut in removing the intra-abdominal mass. Besides the portions removed, there were other parts which passed so deeply into the pelvis that they could not be interfered with. The patient made a good recovery from the operation, but his after history was not traced. The larger part, to which the testicle and a piece of the skin is adherent, has the appearance in section of a well- formed, firm, fibrous tumour. The smaller part, while originally a continuation of the larger piece, is partially separated from it, and shows a much softer and more uniform structure, with a fibrous tissue less well developed. The portions which had to be abandoned seemed at the time to be softer still. The specimen is an illustration of a tumour which, although firm, fibrous, and slow-growing in the main, has certain parts more rapidly growing and infiltrating in character, and corres- pondingly softer and more embryonic in structure.

Fibro-Sareomatous Tumour.—Cast in gelatine and glycerine of the previous tumour, before operation, showing its relative size and external relations. G. C. 2754a. Presented by Joseph Bell, F.R.C.S.E., 1886. Sarcomatous Tumours. 9. 35. Sarcomatous Tumour.—Small tumour, with overlying skin laid open from behind—in spirit. It has involved the skin, and protruded through it towards the surface, but on its deeper aspect it has an indistinct capsule. Its substance is of a uniform, somewhat fibrous texture, with a small cyst developed in the interior. G. C. 948.

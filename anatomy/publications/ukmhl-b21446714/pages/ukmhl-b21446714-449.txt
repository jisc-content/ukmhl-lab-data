Alterations of Skull from premtre. 417 6. 525. Skull Artificially Flattened at the Back in Child- hood.—Skull of a young person—macerated, illustrating the above. It is said to have come from Mount Lebanon. The alteration in shape is stated to be produced by bandaging the head and keeping the child on its back. In this case the flattening is a somewhat vertical one at the hack, between the occiput and the vertex. The result is an alteration in shape, almost the reverse of that seen in the previous specimen. The front and top parts of the head are unusually spherical, and the forehead rises abruptly and high above the face. G. C. 3592. Presented by Charles W. Cathcart, F.K.C.S.E. 6. 526. Absorption from Localised Pressure from without. —Skull-cap—macerated, illustrating the above. There is an elongated area of absorption of the outer table, extending over the adjacent portions of the frontal and parietal bones. The portions of the sagittal and frontal sutures, in- cluded in the area of depression, are especially absorbed, so much so in the case of the sagittal suture that it presents an irregular cleft. The condition has doubtless been due to some form of pressure, of which unfortunately no history has been left. W. C. G. 26. 6. 527. Absorption of the Interior. — Portion of a fronta bone-macerated, showing an area of absorption on the inside, which has no doubt been caused by some form of pressure. B. C. 1. 7. M. 27. 6. 528. Absorption of the Interior.—Portion of an occipital bone, showing unusual depression of the torquelar Herophili, with several eroded pits just below it. Said to be from a tumour of the brain, q q qqq 2 D

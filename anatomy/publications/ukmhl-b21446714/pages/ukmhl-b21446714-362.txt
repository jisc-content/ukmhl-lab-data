330 Diseases of Bone. 1S87. Although no history of syphilis, congenital or acquired, could be obtained, the syphilitic nature of the disease was diagnosed from the course of the symptoms, and it was considered to be probably congenital." The whole of the bone is enlarged by the formation of cancellated tissue. At the upper end there is a section of the necrosis, and its white, non-vascular character is brought out in contrast with the surrounding injected bone. Round the surface of the necrosis there Avas an ulcer of the skin, part of which has been left. Part, however, has been removed, to show patches of caseous material, which had been present in the periosteum outside the base of the ulcer. A certain amount of separation of the necrosis had occurred, but not enough to loosen it. Several white caseous deposits are seen in the interior of the bone, above the necrosis, and one or two are seen near the anterior surface at the lower end. On the soft parts, near the lower end, a large gumma is shown, caseous and non-vascular, and surrounded by an area of increased vascularity. In front of this a small sinus in the skin has been left, and the soft parts removed near it, to show that it led down to a gummatous deposit in the periosteum. G. C. 2770. Presented by P. H. MacLaren, F.R.C.S.E. 6. 336. Syphilitic Enlargement of the Tibia.—Upper end of a right tibia—macerated. There is a deposit of periosteal new bone on the surface. The bone is increased in weight. F. P. C. 446. 6. 337. Congenital Syphilitic Nodes on the Lower Ends of the Tibia and Fibula.—Plaster cast of the left leg and foot of the boy from whom the cast No. 6. 295 was taken. The cast shows a swelling due to enlargement of the lower ends of the tibia and fibula, just above the ankle. G. C. 3283.

Diseases of Joints. 432 7. 17. Tubercular Synovitis.—Left knee-joint, opened from the front—in spirit, illustrating the above. An encroachment of the diseased synovial membrane has taken place upon the cartilage of the femur, especially opposite the ligamentum mucosum and the ligamenta alaria, and round the patella, whose cartilage is also at one place ulcerated through. The interior of the synovial membrane has numerous delicate fringed processes hanging from it. G. C. 541. 7. 18. Tubercular Synovitis.—Right knee-joint, laid open from the front—in spirit, illustrating the above. There has been an encroachment of the diseased synovial membrane upon the trochlear surface from above and laterally, and also, as in the previous specimens, in the position of the ligamentum mucosum and the ligamenta alaria. Similar to the last also, but more advanced, is the affection round the patellar cartilage. It should be remembered that what now appear to be layers of lymph covering the cartilage have been in the recent condition vascular granulations (see 7. 16 and the next specimens). 2449. Presented by J. Bell Pettigbew, F.R.C.S.E. 7. 19. Tubercular Synovitis.—Section of an injected knee-joint —in spirit, illustrating the above. The patient, a lad of 15, had first felt pain in the joint in November 1886. This was followed by a swelling, which began on the outside, and spread all over the joint. An abscess was opened in March 1887, and healed in four months, after which he went about quite well, except that a little swelling still remained. In March 1888 the disease again broke out; an abscess formed, and continued to discharge after having been opened. The joint gradually grew worse, and the limb was amputated in October 1888. At no time were there starting pains at night. The pain was never great. The chief complaint was swelling and stiffness. The injected synovial membrane is seen encroaching on

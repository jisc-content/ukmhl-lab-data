436 Diseases of Joints. the Joint.—Left knee of an adult—injected and in spirit, laid open by turning up the patella, illustrating the above. The articular cartilages have been attacked round the margins here and there, especially upon the inner condyle, the outer part of the trochlear surface of the femur, and on the patella. The bone in these places is exposed, and the cartilage either removed entirely or partly detached. The synovial membrane is involved all round, and two sinuses, one above either condyle, communicate between the joint and the skin. The femur is thickened by a deposit of new periosteal bone round the shaft. F. P. C. 2965. 7. 27. Abscess extending- from Tubercular Synovitis.— Section of the lower end of a left femur, with part of the wall of an abscess above the articular surface—in spirit. Probably this has been a tubercular extension into the bursa under the subcrureus. B. C. II. M. 22. 7. 28. Tubercular Synovitis, with Abscesses and Destruc- tion Of Cartilage.— Eight knee-joint of a child—injected with vermilion, laid open from the front—in spirit, illustrating the above. The articular cartilage of the femur has been entirely destroyed, except upon a narrow area round the edge. The trochlear surface and that of the inner condyle is covered with granulations, and the under surface of the outer condyle is irregularly hollowed out. On the outer aspect of the femur the walls of an abscess cavity are shown communicating in two places with the interior of the joint, as well as with another abscess beneath the subcrureus muscle. This illustrates the mode of formation of these abscesses. Portions of the thickened, gelatinous, synovial membrane caseate, soften, and run together to form an abscess. This

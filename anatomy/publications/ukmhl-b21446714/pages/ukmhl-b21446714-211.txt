179 Gunshot Fractures of the Tibia, Presented by Surgeon-General Billings, U.S.A. The bullet still preserves its conical shape, although it has been rendered irregular by impact against the bone. It has forced itself partly into the outer condyle, and has partly split it off. The bullet, however, has had but a shallow bed, and, except for the surrounding soft parts, must have been loose. It is now held in place by a wire. G. C. 3426. Presented by Surgeon-General Billings, U.S.A. 3. 383. Gunshot Fracture of the Upper End of the Tibia and Fibula.—Upper end of a right tibia and corresponding part of the fibula, except the head, which is wanting. The specimen is macerated, and the fragments wired together, to show the above. There is great comminution of the tibia, and loss of sub- stance. An irregular hole, larger on the outer side, is seen on either side of the tibia, below the articular surface. The sur- rounding bone is comminuted into numerous fragments, and the knee-joint has been extensively involved. G. C. 3427. Presented by Surgeon-General Billings, U.S.A. 3. 384. Lodging: of a Bullet in the Head of the Tibia after Penetration.—Upper end of a left tibia and fibula- macerated, showing changes from the above injury. A conical bullet is seen with its tip just emerging at the back of the inner tuberosity,'having passed obliquely backwards from the front and outer side. There is considerable loss of substance in the track of the bullet, which has split the bone, and, at the back, wedged the portions aside. The splitting extends for about four and a half inches down the shaft. Some cloth surrounds the back of the bullet, having evidently been carried in with it. Q Q 3m

142 Injuries of Bone. 3. 274. Recent Compound Fracture of the Tibia.—Section of a left tibia and adjacent soft parts—injected, and in spirit —to show the above. The patient was a rather "done" man of 56. He was knocked over by an engine, and sustained a compound fracture of both bones of the left leg. An effort was made by antiseptic means to save the limb, but suppuration set in, and amputation became necessary. The stump was affected by a persistently spreading cellulitis, which resisted all treat- ment and eventually carried him off. The broken ends of the bone are smooth and bare, and would probably have necrosed in time. There was consider- able congestion of the medulla at and near the seat of fracture. G. C. 3200.

Ununited Compound Fracture of the Tibia and Fibula.—Lower two-thirds of the shafts of a left tibia and fibula (blackened by putrefaction)—macerated, showing the above. The tibia has been broken about the middle, and the fibula lower down. The fracture has evidently been compound, and must have been followed by extensive suppuration, continuing for weeks and months. There has been great periostitic enlargement of both bones. The lower fragment of the tibia near the fracture is greatly eroded, and was probably necrotic, but no fragments are loose. The upper fragment of the tibia is enlarged, and its broken surface is hollowed out and very irregular. The upper frag- ment of the fibula is enlarged and condensed. A mass of new bone unites the lower end of the tibia to that of the fibula, but there has been no union between any of the other fragments. F. P. C. 158. 3 276.

313 Syphilitic Destruction of Face. 6. 279. Syphilitic Disease of the Skull—healed after Loss of Bone about the Nose and Left Orbit.—Anterior half of a skull—macerated, illustrating the above. The bridge of the nose, nasal septum, and margins of the nasal cavity have been lost, and a single rounded aperture represents the anterior nares. There is a small aperture in the hard palate. The ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses are no longer traceable. Their position is now occupied by roughened bone. The antrum of Highmore on each side is nearly filled in by similar roughened bone, but an opening into the frontal sinuses is still present. The outer wall of the left orbit is for the most part wanting, and the disease here seems to have been in progress at the patient's death, although at other places it must have subsided. The interior of the skull is irregular, apparently from development of bone round the blood-vessels! The section of the cranial vault shows an increased thickness and partial filling up of the dipioe. B. C. i. 7. M. 19. . 280. Syphilitic Disease of the Nose and Mouth.—Cast in glue and glycerine of the face of a woman, illustrating the above. The bridge of the nose has been destroyed, and its fleshy part is represented by an irregular scar. The upper lip is greatly scarred. This cast represents the appearance of patients after severe destruction of the nose. G. C. 3557. 6. 281. Syphilitic Disease of the Bones of the Face, with very great Destruction.—Plaster cast of the front of the head and neck of a man, illustrating the above. Described by Sir Charles Bell as " A cast exhibiting the effects of the disease called noli me tangere, or rather that kind of it which is called lupus, in which the face is gnawed or eaten away. The man from whom his was taken was long a patient in the Hospital. When he swallowed, the action of the muscles of the fauces could be observed."

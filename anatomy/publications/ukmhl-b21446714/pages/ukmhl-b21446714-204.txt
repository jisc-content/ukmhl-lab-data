172 Injuries of Bone. The surface of the main fragments of the tibia, as well as of some of the smaller pieces, indicates suppuration and inflam- mation as in 3. 344. B. 0, xvn. 44. 3.360. Gunshot Fracture of the Tibia and Fibula- Lower three-fourths of a right tibia and fibula—macerated, showing the above. The patient was wounded at Waterloo by a musket ball, and received no assistance whatever until fourteen days after the battle. The limb was amputated at the Gendarmerie. It may be noted that while the part of the tibia struck by the ball has been comminuted into small pieces, the remaining portions of the shaft are unaffected, with the exception of one fissure on the lower piece. A slight crust of new periosteal bone has formed on the main portions of the shaft, as in the previous case. C. xvn. 45. 3. 361. Gunshot Fracture of the Shaft of the Tibia and Fibula.—Portions of a right tibia and fibula—macerated, showing the above. "Example of the effect of a ball striking the cylinder of the tibia." Like the two previous specimens, this one shows comminution at the point struck, with little or no splitting of the remainder. The slight crust of new periosteal bone indicates a similar period of about fourteen days before the limb was amputated. B- C. xvn. 46. 3. 362.

Fractures of the Femur. 131 3. 241. Badly united Fracture in the Lower Third of the Shaft.—Eight femur—macerated, showing the above. The upper fragment is in front and to the inner side of the lower, which is rotated very slightly outwards. The broken ends overlap considerably, and there is a large mass of callus between them. j>_ C. I. 1 M 29 3. 242. Ununited Fracture of the Shaft—Portions of the shaft of a femur—with the muscles dissected off and in spirit, to show the above, "The bone was twice broken. After the first accident, matters seeming to go on prosperously, he had risen from bed, and was walking upon crutches, when his crutch slipped from under him, and he broke the bone a second time. It seemed now to be very ill set, for the preparation shows the bone riding, accordingly union by bone did not take place P joint formed instead, and in this condition he was broughtinto the Middlesex- Hospital. I made various attempts, by exciting the extremities of the bone, to produce what has been termed ossific inflammation, but without succeeding. At last, at the earnest request of the patient, the limb was amputated." The bones have been in bad position, greatly overlappino, and are now united by apparently fully-formed fibrous tissue! The medullary cavity of each fragment has been closed in by bone, and a spur of bone has grown from the side of the upper fragment. Between this and the lower fragment a false joint (adventitious bursa) has formed. This has been laid open and a fibrous band crossing it is indicated by a bristle. The closure of the medullary cavity would indicate that the non- union in this case was at least not due to deficient power to form W- B.C.I. 1.M.11. 3. 243, Fracture of the Shaft, followed by Sarcoma - Section of a femur, soft parts dissected off-in spirit, showino- the above. The patient, a man aged 45, fell and broke his femur. After it h,d united, he fell and broke the bone a second time. It was treateTas befo, e

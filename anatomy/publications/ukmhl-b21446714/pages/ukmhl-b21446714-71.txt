FEACTUEES OF THE SKULL. FISSURED FRACTURES. 3. 1. Fissured Fracture of both Parietal Bones. — Calvarium of an elderly person—macerated—showing the above fracture, and two trephine openings on the right side. The patient had fallen from a great height. When taken to the surgeon he was insensible, and had an extensive effusion of blood over the right parietal bone. "When the bone was exposed by an incision a fissure was seen, and first the posterior, then the anterior trephine hole was made in the hope of relieving pressure from blood clot. However, '' the patient continued to snort in a state of complete insensibility, and died." On the right side the fissures radiate in three directions from about the centre of the parietal eminence. The widest fissure runs down to the centre of the squamous suture. Another fissure, more on the outer than on the inner table, runs forward to the coronal suture, while the third, running back- wards over the trephine openings, does not extend beyond the posterior one. On the left side a fissure runs from above the parietal eminence towards the posterior inferior angle of the bone. B. C. 1. 2. M. 1. 3.2. Fissured Fracture of the Frontal and Parietal

Tubercular Affection of Synovial Sheath, "Compound Ganglion."â€”Cast in gelatine and glycerine of the front of a left wrist of a woman, illustrating the above. " Mrs. W., aged 41, was admitted to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, in January 1891, complaining of pain and swelling in the palm of the left hand and wrist. Two years ago there appeared a swelling on the front of the wrist, unattended with pain, except under strong exertion. This remained unchanged until five weeks ago, when a swelling on the palm of the hand appeared also. The fingers became stiffer, and now she cannot grasp anything. Three years ago her foot was amputated for tubercular disease of the ankle. No other history of tubercle. Her- family history is good. Incisions were made in the wrist and palm, and gelatinous and melon seed-like bodies scraped out." There is a distinct swelling of the front of the wrist and adjacent part of the palm, with a slight constriction opposite the position of the anterior annular ligament. G. C. 3371.

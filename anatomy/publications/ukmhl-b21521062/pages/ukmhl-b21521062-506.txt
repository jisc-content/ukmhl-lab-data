LIVER. [chap. XXXIII. 478 work is continuous with the network of thelohule in which the cells lie. In the human subject, and in most mammalia, the small ducts do not form a network in this manner, but pass olf at once to the cell containing network with which they are continuous. In the pig, the smallest branches of the duct penetrate the capsule of the loljule at various points, and immediately become connected with an intimate network which lies immediately beneath it, and partly within its substance. This network may be regarded as the most superficial portion of the cell-containing network, and where the liver is fatty it contains cells distended with oil globules. In the human liver, and in those of most animals, except the pig, some of the smallest branches of the duct pass for a short dis- tance beneath the sm'face of the lobule, and become continuous with some of the branches of the cell-containing network in that situation. In a cursory examination these narrow ducts appear to lie amongst the cells without being connected witli them. The greater number of branches, however, join the cell-containing net- work round the margin of the fissures. Near to the point where the duct joins the cell-containing network it becomes very much narrowed, and is often not more than the ^oVo FoVo i^^ch in diameter, and even less, in the uninjected state. Several of the narrowest ducts in the pig are represented in Fig. 229. Fig. 22U. Â«. Small branch of interlobular duct-piR. b.

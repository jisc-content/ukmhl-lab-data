[chap. XXXV. SPLEEN. 514 Malpighian Corpuscles.—Upon making a section of a fresh ox's spleen, a number of small round wliitish bodies will be seen. They are sometimes collected in groups of four or six together, and appear to be connected with the smaller arteries, which are in close proximity to them. These small bodies have been named Malpi- ghian corpuscles from their discoverer; they are in close contact with the spleen pulp, except at the points where they are in con- nection with the coats of the artery. The Malpighian corpuscles are very distinct in pigs, sheep, oxen, and guinea pigs. In most other mammalia they are to be demon- strated, although with greater difi&culty. In the human subject they are constantly present; but often are not to be distinguished in consequence of rapidly undergoing post mortem change. In birds, these bodies are very numerous, and have been observed, by MiiUer, in the chelonia, among reptiles, but they cannot be seen in the naked amphibia. In fishes, they appear to be absent.

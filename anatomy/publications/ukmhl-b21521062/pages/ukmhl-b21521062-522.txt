494 KIDNEY [chap. XXXIV. * Phil. Trans., 1842. Fig. 240. the capillaries of the Malpighian tuft, enters the efferent vessel, which conducts it into the branch of a portal vein ramifying upon the surface of tlielobule. From the portal vein, it passes into a system of venous capillaries surrounding the tubes, from which it is at last carried into the emul- gent veins, which, with the arterv, lie in the cen - tral part of the lobule.

The por- tal system of the liver has a double source, one extraneous, the other in the organ itself; so the portal system of the kidney, in the lower tribes, has a two-fold origin, one extraneous, the other lu the organ itself. In both cases, the extraneous source is the principal one, and the artery furnishing the internal source is very small. But in the kid- ney of the higher tribes, the portal system has only one internal soui'ce, and the artery supplying it is propor- tionably large."* Of the Secretion of C/?-me.—Haring passed in review the anatomical arrange- ment of the different structures com- posing the kidney, we shall now pro- ceed to consider briefly the functions Jt^L^r^^^:^^^l^ ^hich the several parts perform.

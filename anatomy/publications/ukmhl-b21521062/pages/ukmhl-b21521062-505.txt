CHAP. XXXIII.] OF THE SMALLEST DUCTS. 477 solved, unless the solution is very Aveak. Acetic acid produces a somewhat similar change, but the cell membrane does not appear to be dissolved. The nuclei always appear more distinctly defined aijer the addition of the acid; cells which, at first, were found to contain no coloui-ed granules, by being soaked for some time in dilute acetic acid exhibited many.

Kolliker gives a diagram to illustrate his view, which supposes that the open ends of the ducts impinge against the columns of the Terminal portion of interlnljular duct, witli epittie- 1 ,- n . ,1 • n lium witliin it.

Dr. Handfield Jones traces the ducts to the same point, where, he believes, they ter- minate Avithout having any direct communication with the hepatic cells; and he considers that the small cells in these ducts are alone concerned in the secretion of the bile (Fig. 228). If this view of the anatomy of the liver be correct, this large organ must be nearly related to the vascular glands.'^ Dr. Beale's researches show that Mr, Kiernan's original view is more nearly allied to the truth. In the interlobular fissures numerous finer branches leave the small trunk of the duct and pass towards the secreting cells. In the human subject, many of these may be followed for some distance without giving off branches or anastomosing with each other. These small ducts lie around the small branches of the portal vein, and their course is often tortuous. In some animals, particularly in the rabbit, the small ducts anastomose, forming a network round the vein.

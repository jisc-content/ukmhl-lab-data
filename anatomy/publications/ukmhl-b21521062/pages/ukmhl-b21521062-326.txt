THE BLOOD. [chap. XXVII, 298 any other imrt (Fig. 173). Its size varies considerably: in the same drop of blood there are corpuscles of all sizes within a range of from to —— of an inch in diameter, the average beintr 4000 2800 , , . 1 from the — to , J--. With a good microscope, and a magnify- ing power ^of 200 diameters, the characters of the blood-corpuscles ^.^ may be most clearly seen, and when the instrument is perfectly adjusted, the double concave surface may be unequivocally demonstrated. If the corpuscles are floated in water, they become biconvex: if in a fluid denser than serum, as in a strono; saline or saccharine solution, they Ueil corpuscles from human blood:-a. slirillk, put OU a shrivclled aSpCCt, ^tZ'i^^ J-^X^^ ^^'^ become gx-anulated on their a roll.

With refer- ence to this doctrine, we have only to state that we have care- fully examined two portions of the same blood after they had been agitated in oxygen and carbonic acid gas, and thus been rendered respectively scarlet and purple, but that we have failed to detect any well-marked difference in shape between the blood-corpuscles of the two specimens. The blood-particles have a remarkable tendency to aggregate in rolls like pieces of coin (Fig, 173,-i) : this tendency, as has been already remarked, is said by some to be greatly increased in blood which forms a huffy coat in its coagulation. The red blood-corpuscle of Mammals resembles in shape and structure that of man (Fig. 174) : there is much diversity of size in the various orders ; it is smallest in the ruminants, and the smallest known is that of the Napu musk-deer, which is reported by Mr. Gulliver not to exceed -njJinjth of an inch in diameter.

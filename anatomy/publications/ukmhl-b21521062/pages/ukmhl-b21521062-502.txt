474 LIVEll. [chap. XXXIll. network. It has long been a question whether the cells lie amongst these capillary vessels, or are enclosed in a basement Fig. 22G. Section ot Imv.se'.s Mvor, nt right angles to brtmclies of tlie hepatic vein, sliowing tlic tells lormiiig lines rudiatinp trom the centro towards the circumfurenco of the lobules, from a prepavalion of Dr. liealc's. membrane, as we should expect from the analogy of other glandular organs. It has been admitted by all who have examined the liver carefully, that in sections made in a particular direction, the cells are seen to form lines which radiate from the centre towards the circumference of the lobule; these lines being connected witli oblique or transverse branches. Such an appearance is not pre- sented in every section, but only in those made exactly at right angles, with the small twig of the hepatic vein. This is well seen in fig. 226. The cells are described by Kolliker and others, as being placed end to end, forming solid cylinders, but not invested with basement membrane. Usually there is only room for one row of cells; but in some situations, two or three may be seen between two capillary vessels. Dr. Handfield Jones has been led by his researches to adopt the same conclusion with regard to the arrangement of the liver cells, and Dr. Cai'penter has expressed himself in favour of a similar view. On the other hand, Retzius, Leidy, and some other observer?, advocate the presence of a tubular basement membrane, in which the ccllg lie, and which is continuous with the hepatic ducts.

HEARING. 85 CHAP. XVITI.] Termination of the nerve in the ampulla of a Ray, highly magnified. (From Wagner.) Of the Auditory Nerve.â€”The portio mollis of the seventh pair has its origin from the medulla oblongata by two roots. One penetrates to the central part of the medulla oblongatai n the same way, and fol- lowing the same direction, as the portio dura, but passing to a much greater depth into its substance. The other winds round the corpus restiforrae, not penetrating it, but simply adhering to its surface, until it reaches the floor of the fourth ventricle, where it connects itself with the olivary columns, and in many instances is evidently continuous with the white striae on either side of the calamus scrip- torius, which for that reason have been very generally regarded as fascicles of origin of the portio mollis. The portio mollis, when contrasted with the other nerves of the medulla oblongata, is remarkable for its delicacy of structure, a character which had attracted the attention of the older anatomists and by reason of which they had given the nerve the appellation " mollis." It has but a very delicate neurilemma, and its fascicles are loosely held together; it seems strictly a direct prolongation of the white matter of the brain. The portio mollis enters the internal auditory foramen, and there fonns a connexion with the portio dm'a, by means of a few fascicles of fibres which constitute the "portio intermedia" of Wrisberg. It is difficult to say whether this consists of fibres proceeding from the "aixditory to the facial nerve, or from the latter to the former. It is most reasonable to suppose that the muscular nerve (the facial)

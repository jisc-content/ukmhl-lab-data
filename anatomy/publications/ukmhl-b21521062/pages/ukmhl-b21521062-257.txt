229 CHAP. XXV.] THE VILLI. basement membrane. From tbis arise at various points small veins, whicb pass out of the villus in one or more trunks (fig. 162). The cavity of the villus also contains one or more small lacteals, in which originates the proper lacteal plexus of the intestine. The villi are seen \vhite with chyle, during the absorption of that fluid, and the chyle may be fixed in them by coagulation, if the membrane is promptly immei-sed in alcohol. Respecting the manner in which these vessels are disposed in the villus, however, nothing certain is known. Some have described a net-work of these vessels extending to the extremity of the villus. The investigation is one of the most difficult in minute anatomy, and is highly important as bearing upon the mechanism of the absorption of chyle. Fig. Ifil. Capillary plexus of the villi of the human small intestine, as seen on the surface, after a successful injection, magnified 50 diam. Nothing whatever is known of the relation of the nerves to the villi. The tissue which occupies the cavity of the villus, and which supports the capillary plexus, and whatever other vessels may exist in it, is a soft, imperfectly formed areolar tissue, containing nuclei and granules, and resembling somewhat the tissue contained in the gustatory papillae of the tongue. That portion of it which cor- responds to the free extremity of the villus differs from the rest ; it exhibits a vesicular structure, and resembles very minute fat vesi- cles, filled by some transparent fluid. The tissue which occupies the remainder of the villus seems to consist chiefly of nuclei or granules, some of which present an indistinct arrangement in columns, which are parallel to the axis of the villus. During the process of chylification it appears to be the seat of some very remarkable changes connected with the absorption of chyle.

451 INGESTA AND EGESTA. CHAP. XXXII.] one organ may take upon itself the work of another, whose healthy- function has been temporarily suspended or impaired by disease. Advantage is taken of this circumstance in the treatment of kidney diseases, in which the functions of those organs are temporarily or permanently impaired. In such cases, the removal of the urinary constituents is promoted through the skin, or from the intestinal tube, by giving purgative medicines, and by promoting secretions. The excretion of biliary matter in the urine in cases of jaundice, and the separation of the menstrual fluid from the mucous mem- brane of the lungs or stomach, are familiar examples of this vi- carious action. Very numerous cases of metastasis of the urinary secretion are on record; and elements of the urine have been met with in vomit, in the stools, in the tears, and secretions of the ears and nose; in the milk, and upon the cutaneous surface generally^ particularly about the navel. If the kidneys of an animal be extirpated, the elements of the m'ine may be detected in many situations in which they are not normally present. In disease, when the functions of the kidneys are much impaired, it is not uncommon for the elements of the urine to pass off from the stomach by vomiting. Ingesta and Egesta.—It is obvious, that if the weight of the body remains the same, the quantity of matter removed by the different excretory channels will exactly correspond to the ingesta, although the arrangement of the elements will be changed. The proportion in which the different elements entering into the composition of the food are removed by the various secreting organs is shown in the following table, the result of some excellent experi- ments of M.

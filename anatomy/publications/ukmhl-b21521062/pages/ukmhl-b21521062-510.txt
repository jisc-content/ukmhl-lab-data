In consequence of the position of the liver, the right-kidney is placed rather lower down than the left. These organs are surrounded by a varying quantity of fat, and are placed behind the peritoneum. The kid- ney is of a dark reddish brown colour, of a firm consistence, and of a close compact texture. Its general form is that of an ordinary French bean, compressed from before backwards, its convex border being external, and its concave edge, or hilum, where the vessels enter, looking towards the median line. The v/eight of the healthy kidney is from 4^ to 5 oz. in the male, and somewhat less in the female. The kidneys are supplied with blood by the renal arteries, two large trunks which come off at right angles from the abdo- minal aorta. The blood is returned by the lai'ge renal or emulgent veins M'hich open into the inferior cava. These vessels, with the nerves for the supply of the organ, enter the kidney at its notch or hilum, whence also proceeds the ureter. Of the Kidney in the lower Animals.—The first trace of aii organ whicL cau be regarded in the light of a kidney is met with among the Polypi, but the renal nature of this is at least doubtful. In Porpita, one of the Acalephw, KoUiker has described an organ which contains guanin, and which lie there- fore looks upon in the light of a kidney. In the Annelida the existence of a renal apparatus is doubtful; but there is some reason for beheving that the so-called respiratory organs are to be regarded in this light. The existence of

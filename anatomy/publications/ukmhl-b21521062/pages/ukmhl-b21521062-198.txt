Magnified 300 diameters. contact; and their compact proper wall is about as thick as their cavity is wide. Except near the pulp-cavity, they are, as it were, hairy with filamentary canaliculi, which diverge on all sides, and form innumerable junctions with one another; so that the tubuli, through- out most of the dentine, may be said to communicate with each other independently of the pulp-cavity, into which they all open. To- wards the outer surface of the dentine, where it is encrusted on the crown with enamel and on the root with bone, the tubuli gradually taper, and finally terminate in diminutive canals, which open, some into small, irregular lacuna? (forming a layer on the root, termed by Mr. Tomes the granular layer), some into the lacuna) of the osseous investment of the fang, and others upon the surface on which the enamel rests. Occasionally the tubuli are dilated into true lacunaj, or form free arches of communication.

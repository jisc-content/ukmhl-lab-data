CHAP. xviiT.] THE SEMI-CIRCULAR CANALS. 73 entrance of a portion of the auditory nerve from the internal audi- tory meatus. At the hinder part of the inner wall is the orifice of the aqueductus vestihuli, a fine canal penetrating the vestibule from the posterior surface of the petrous bone, and containing, as some describe, a tubular prolongation of the lining membrane of the ves- tibule, ending in a minute pouch between two layers of the dura Fig. 135.

Breschet considers this to be an evidence of a continuity once existing between the lining membrane of the cranium, and that of the vestibule, and it is certain that in most fishes the vestibule is a process of the cranial cavity, or sepa- rated from it only by a membraniform septum. Whatever other use the aqueduct of the vestibule may serve, it seems, certainly, to convey small vessels to the internal ear. The lower part of the inner wall presents a hemispherical depression (fovea JiemisphericaJ, and immediately above it, and on the upper wall, another, trans- versely oval and larger (fovea semi-elliptica). These are separated by a small pyramidal eminence. 2. The semi-circular canals are three in number, all opening at both ends into the vestibule, so that there would be six orifices, were not one of the orifices common to two of the canals. The canals are of unequal length, but all describe more than half a circle,

Parietal Sacculi and Appendages of the Ducts.â€”In ducts of about the j-i^- of an inch in diameter, and larger, there are many little saccular dilatations situated in the coats. These are the so-called glands of the ducts, and in the pig, and most other animals which we have examined, are arranged all round the tube. Dr. Beale, who has examined them with great care, describes them as, for the most part, simple oval pouches connected with the cavity of the duct by a veiy narrow neck, often not the 3-0V0 inch in diameter. In the larger ducts, they are branched, and often rim for some distance in the coats. Occa- sionally, the branches of one gland anastomose with those of another. The largest are singularly complicated, and project some distance from the duct lying in the areolar tissue which surrounds it. Kg. 224. In the human subject, a different arrangement occurs. Instead of being situated entu'ely round the tube, the openings form two rows or lines situated upon opposite sides of the ducts. The greater number of these openings are, however, the orifices, not of sacculi, but of small irregular tubes, which run obliquely for some distance in the coats of the duct and anastomose; some of a Portion of a larsc duct of the pig, injected with vermilion, showing tlic large cavities or glands in the coats of the ducts.

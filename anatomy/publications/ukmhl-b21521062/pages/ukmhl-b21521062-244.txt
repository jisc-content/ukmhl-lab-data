Anatomy of the Intestinal Canal.—The intestinal canal commences at the pylorus and terminates at the anus. It exhibits a very obvious subdivision into two portions: a narrower and much longer portion, disposed in numerous coils or convolutions, which is called the small intestine (iutestinum tcnue) ; and a much wider but shorter portion, the large intestine (intestiuum crassum). The length of the whole intestinal canal in the adult is between thirty and forty feet, or about six times that of the body: the small intestine forms five-sixths of this. There is a very distinct natural demarcation between these two portions of the intestinal canal; the large intestine commences by a dilated cul-de-sac, which communicates on its inner side with the small intestine. This portion, which is the widest part of the large intestine, is lodged in the right iliac fossa; it constitutes the com- mencement or the head of the colon, and as it forms a blind extre- mity or cul de sac beyond the junction of the small intestine with it, it is named caput cacum coli, or commonly ceecum. Connected with it is a remarkable appendix, which proceeds from its inner and posterior part, and hangs down into the pelvis in a slightly curved form, which gives it the appearance of a worm (lumbricus), and receiving support from a small fold of peritoneum. This is called the appendix caci vermiformis. It is'a small process from the ceecum, hollow, cylindrical, in size rather larger than a goose-quill, about three inches long, and ending in a blind extremity which lies free in the pelvis, but having a free communication with the caecum where it is attached to that intestine. The large intestine com- mencing at this part ascends from the right iliac fossa, through the right lumbar region, as high as the concave surface of the liver;

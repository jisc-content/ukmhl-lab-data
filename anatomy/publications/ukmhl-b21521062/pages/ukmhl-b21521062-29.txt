CONDITIONS OF SMELL. This sense, designed to acquaint us with the odorous quaUties of particles suspended or dissolved in the atmosphere, is seated in a portion of the nasal mucous memhrane to which the air has access during ordinary breathing, and it may fairly be regarded as ap- pended to the respiratory organ, much as the sense of taste has been seen to pertain to the digestive apparatus. But though it may serve to protect the Imigs from the inhalation of deleterious gases, its principal use appears to be that of seconding the impres- sions of taste in conveying intelligence of the properties of food; for it almost invariably happens, that food possessing a decided flavour has likewise a not less characteristic smell. Unlike the organs of touch and taste, that in which smell resides has no capacity of movement in relation to its ordinary stimuli; a deficiency quite supplied by the expansion of the chest in breathing, which carx'ies the stream of odorous particles over the sentient surface. The nose consists, 1, of two chief cavities or nasal fossie, sepa- rated from one another by a vertical, bony, and cartilaginous sep- tum, and each partially subdivided, by the spongy or turbinated bones, projecting from the outer wall, into three passages or mea- tuses : and, 2, of subordinate chambers, cells, or sinuses, of irregular size, hollowed principally in the ethmoid, sphenoid, frontal, and su-

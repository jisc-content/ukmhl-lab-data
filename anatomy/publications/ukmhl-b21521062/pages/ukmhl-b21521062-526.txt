498 URINE. [chap. XXXIV, this deposit, and spermatozoa are occasionally met with. In disease, the deposit may consist of pus, or blood corpuscules, and fibrinous moulds of the Fig. 243. Casts of the uriniferous tubes, a. Casts with epithelium, at .r a free cell of epithelium, b. Very large cast containing epithelium, c. Small grannlai" casts, d. Small waxy cast. e. Casts coutauiing fat cells and free oil at x cell filled vntXx fat globules. /. Pus globules, at x one acted upon by acetic acid. uriniferous tubes,* entangling cells of renal epithelium, which may contain t'ig.ui. many oil globules, and crystals of oxalate of lime, pus, or blood glo- bules, are sometimes fovmd. In such cases, the urine will also contain albumen. Among the deposits most frequently observed, may bu mentioned the amorphous deposit of lithate of soda, crystals of lithic acid, of oxalate of lime, of trijjle or ammoniaco-magnesian phos- phate, and occasionally crystals of cystine. Composition of healthy Urine.â€”The urine is a highly complex fluid, and contains substances having very different properties. Its constituents are composed partly of organic, and partly of inorganic compounds which are held in solution in the aqueous portion of the secretion. A small quantity of car- bonic acid gas is likewise often found held in solution. The chief organic constituents of healthy m-ine are the following: urea, uric or lithic acid, and certain extractive matters, with small quantities of creatine, creatinine, hip- puric and lactic acids, and ammoniacal salts. The inorganic constituents consist of certain salts which enter into the composition of the food, but a. Crystals of triple phosphate, c. Stellate variety. b. Granules of phosphate of lime. d. Crystals of Cystine. * Diseases of the Kidney, by George Johnson, M.D.

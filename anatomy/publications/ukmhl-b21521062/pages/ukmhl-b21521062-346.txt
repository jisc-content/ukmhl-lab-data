THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD, [chap, xxviii. 318 separate readily when pulled in the transverse direction. They form a series of concentric layers, in number proportioned to the thicknessof the artery,composed of coarse yellow fibres which branch and interlace freely. Upon fine transverse sections of the middle coat of one of the large arteries of man, or of the ox, we may observe the peculiar arrangement of these branching fibres which gives rise to the tendency of this coat to split into lamellse. Certain large fibres or rods of yellow elastic tissue are disposed in successive concentric circles which pass transversely, and sometimes obliquely round the artery. (Figs. 187, 189,190). These branch in a penniform manner (hence we propose to call them the penniforni fibres), and interlace with those on the same plane as Fig. 187.

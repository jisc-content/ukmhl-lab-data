It consists of three parts, the vestibule, the semi-circular canals, and the cochlea, all of which, from their delicacy and mi- nuteness of structure, demand careful examination. They are a series of cavities hidden in the hardest part of the petrous bone, communicating on the outside with the tympanum, by the fenestrac ovalis and rotunda already described, and on the inside with the internal auditory canal, which conveys the nerve to them. The very compact bone immediately bounding these cavities, considered apart from the less dense bone which surrounds it, is termed the osseous labyrinth, in distinction from a membranous labyrinth within. Of the Osseous Labyrinth.â€”The singularly complex shape of this part of the organ makes it difficult to describe. 1. The vestibule or common central cavity, placed immediately to the inner side of the tympanum, is flattened from side to side, and about a fifth of Fig. 134. Osseous labjTinth of the left side. o.

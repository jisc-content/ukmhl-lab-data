[chap. xvir. INNERVATION. 62 striking a mean between the two impressions is, therefore, con- stantly made use of. The above facts abundantly prove the non-existence of absolutely corresponding points on the two retinae, such as were formerly held to exist. But they do not invalidate what has before been advanced respecting the general correspondence of certain ti-acts of the two retinae, and the absolute non-correspondence of others. Mr. Wheatstone farther observes, that if two dissimilar images are represented at once to the corresponding parts of the two retina}, they are not blended, but seen alternately, according to their distinctness and degi*ee of illumination. This is a very sin- gular circumstance, and agrees closely with what takes place when dissimilar colours are viewed in the same way."'" * On the subjects treated of in this chapter reference is made to tlie following works: Zinn, Deseriptio Anatomica Oculi Humani; Haller, Elcraenta PhysiologiEe, torn.

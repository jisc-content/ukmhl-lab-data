The chemical changes which are continually taking place in animals and, at least under some circumstances, in plants, are accompanied with the development of a certain amount of heat. The elevation of temperatm-e may be so slight as to elude the ordinary means of observation; and although the sensible temper- ature of the organised body is very slightly higher than that of the medium in which it is placed, the quantity of heat set free in a given time may be considerable. This development of heat seems to result from the action of the oxygen upon the combustible elements of the food, and in a less degree upon those of the tissues. The chemical combination in which the largest amount of heat is disengaged in the higher animals, and upon which their high temperature seems to depend, is that of carbon and oxygen, re- sulting in the production of carbonic acid. Whenever oxygen combines with carbon, hydrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, etc., or with a metal, heat is developed in an amount exactly proportioned to the quantity of substance consumed. The sensible temperature produced varies, however, with the in- tensity and rapidity of the chemical action. When the action is intense, the temperature rises very rapidly, and may reach a very high degree for a short time. If, on the other hand, the action is slow, the temperature may be scarcely elevated above that of the surroimding medium; but this slight elevation may continue for a considerable time. The quantity of heat developed in the two cases, however, is precisely the same. Development of Heat in Plants,—Heat is developed by the seeds of plants during germination; and at the same time oxygen is removed from the air, and carbonic acid evolved. Buds, flowers and ripening fruits also evolve a certain quantity of heat.

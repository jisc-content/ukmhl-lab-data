INNERVATION. [chap. xvii. elaborate structure. It is iu fact composed of five coats or layers, clearly distinguishable from one another. These are, from before backwards, the conjunctival layer of epithelium, the anterior elastic lamina, the cornea proper, the posterior elastic lamina, and the ejn- thelium of the aqueous humor, or posterior epithelium. The cor- nea, when uninflamed, contains no blood-vessels; those of the surrounding parts running back in loops, as they arrive at its border. On the cornea proper, or lamellaied cornea, the thickness and strength of the cornea mainly depend. It is a peculiar modifica- tion of the white fibrous tissue, continuous with that of the sclerotic. At their hne of junction (fig. 109), the fibres, which in the sclerotic Fig. 109. Vertical section of the Sclerotic and Cornea, showing the continuity of their tissue between the dotted lines:—a.

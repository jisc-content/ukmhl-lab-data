CHAP. XXXIII.J DUCT. 469 of capillaries. The Avliole of the arterial blood, therefore, which supplies nutriment to the several structures of the liver, Fiy. 223. A small lobule, sliewinj; the duct branching upon the capsule, from the pig. The saccuH of the ducts are injected in this specimen. The vessel accompanying the duct is a branch of the portal vein. passes through the capillaries of the lobule before it is returned to the heart, and no doubt furnishes a small portion of the matters from which the bile is formed. The artery was rightly regarded by Kieman as one of the sources of the blood conveyed to the secreting structure of the liver, by the branches of the portal vein. The gall-bladder is also supplied largely with arterial blood. The arteries are arranged so as to fonn a beautiful network. Each branch of the artery is accompanied by two branches of the vein, one on either side, and when the arterial and venous networks are injected with different colours a most beautiful appearance is pro- duced. A similar disposition of arteries and veins occurs in the transverse fissure, and also in the large portal canals. This ar- rangement, has probably the effect of ensuring free circulation through the veins in those changes of size and position to which the vessels are liable. Duct.â€”At least one branch of the duct accompanies each branch of the portal vein, but frequently there are two or three. Yrom the branch or branches accompanying the vein, several smaller ones pass off to the secreting structure. In the pig, the inter- lobular ducts, while running between contiguous lobules, are

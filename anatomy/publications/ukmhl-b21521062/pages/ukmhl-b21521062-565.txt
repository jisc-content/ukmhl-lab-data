In writing the present chapter, the authors have received much assistance, I from the following works:—Miiller's "Elements of Physiology," by Baly; I Professor Owen's Lectures " On Comparative Anatomy,'' and his treatise " On Parthenogenesis"; Dr. Carpenter's "Principles of General and Comparative Physiology"; Victor Carus' "System der Thierischen Morphologic"; Art. Ovimi, in the "Cyclopfedia of Anatomy and Physiology," by Dr. Allen Thompson ; " On the Alternation of Generations," by Professor Steenstrup, I translated by the Eay Society. VOL. II. N N

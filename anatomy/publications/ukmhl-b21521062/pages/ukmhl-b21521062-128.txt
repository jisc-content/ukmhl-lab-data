INNERVATION. [chap. XVIII. 100 is not very rare, as he met with several instances of persons not aware of such a sound. Every one must be conscious that the sensation of sound fre- quently lasts longer than the exciting cause of it, as the sensation of light docs. This has been demonstrated experimentally by Savart, who found in his experiments upon toothed wheels that the removal of one tooth did not produce any interruption of the sound. Other proof of this is obtained from the noise which remains in the ears after long travelling in a coach, or in a train upon a rail- road. The subjective phenomena of hearing generally result from some affection of the brain, or of that part of it in which the auditory nerve is implanted. The most common of them are tinnitus aurium, and the buzzing or rushing noise in the ears, which is generally in- dicative of a deficiency rather than a redundancy of blood in the brain ; or it may be caused by some disturbance of local nutrition of the brain giving rise to an irregular developement of nervous power.* * Upon the subjects discussed in this chapter, the reader may consult the works of Scarpa and Soemmerring ; the excellent article on the organ of Hearing by Mr. Wharton Jones in the Cyclop, of Anat.; Muller's elaborate chapter on Hearing in Ills Physiology ; Dr. Wollaston's paper on Sounds inaudible by certain ears, Piiil.

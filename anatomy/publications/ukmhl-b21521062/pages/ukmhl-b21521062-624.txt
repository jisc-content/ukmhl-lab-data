In the present chapter we have to consider the mode of deve- lopment of the most important organs of the body; but we do not propose to enter further into the process of development of the separate tissues, as this part of the subject has been already treated of in the preceding chapters upon the anatomy of the different organs. Development of the Spinal Column.—In man and the higher ver- tebrata, the spinal column is composed of a number of distinct and separate segments, which are connected together by the interven- tion of a fibrous material. This gives to the whole column a con- siderable amount of mobility. In the lower fishes, however, no such division exists; and in the place of numerous vertebrae we bave a continuous mass of a soft consistence running through the whole length of the animal, and known as the Choi'da Dorsalis. The material of which this is composed is the simplest form of cartilage, consisting entirely of a number of large cells, without the interposition of any matrix or intercellular material between them. In the embryonic condition of all vertebrate animals, we meet with a chorda dorsalis entirely composed of cells, and possess- ing similar characters to the permanent chorda dorsalis of the cartilaginous fishes. It is seen as a faint streak at the bottom of the primitive groove. Above it, the central organs of the nervous

CHAP. XXXV.] 511 SPLEEN PULP. These colourless elements constitute a considerable propor- tion of the spleen pulp, and are in contact with the capillary walls, and with the Malpighian corpuscles of the spleen. Grea variation occurs in the size and general character of the cells and nuclei which compose the colourless elements, and they vary much in quantity in diflFcrent physiological conditions of the system Mr. Gray has shown, that in well-fed animals they are much more abundant than in those supplied with an insufficient quantity of food, and their proportion increases after the com- pletion of the digestive process.

They are composed of a proteine compound, and in their chemical characters closely resemble the white corpuscles of the blood. The red colour of the spleen pulp- is due to the presence of a great number of blood globules and coloured corpuscles, free or contained within cells. The blood globules are frequently observed to be smaller than in other situations; their outline is often indistinct; sometimes their surface appears corrugated or shrunken, and their walls in some places collapsed; their outline is irregular and angular, and in

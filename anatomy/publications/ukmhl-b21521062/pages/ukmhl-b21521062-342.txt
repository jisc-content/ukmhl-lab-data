314 THE BLOOD. [chap. XXVII. and spleenâ€”tlie diminution in the coloured particles is accompanied by a remarkable increase in the number of the colourless particles. Some cases of this condition of blood have lately been collected by Professor J. H. Bennett, who proposes for the name Leucocythemia {XiVKog, white; ftvrog^ a cell; a/|Ooa, blood)."'^ The fatty matters of the blood are sometimes increased in quantity apparently from non-elimination. Under these circum- stances the serum becomes quite milky, an appearance which is quite characteristic of this state of blood, and may be removed by ether. We have already alluded (p. 296) to the milkiness which follows the ingestion of fatty food, but which cannot be regarded as abnormal. There is a condition of blood to which F. Simon has given the name span<zmia {pitavoq^ poor), and which is popularly called jooor hlood. This is characterized by changes in the quality rather than in the quantity of the blood-constituents, and especially, perhaps, in the quality of the fibrine. When the blood is in this state, haemor- rhages are of frequent occurrence, owing probably to the imperfect manner in which the coats of the blood-vessels are nourished. Pur- pura and scurvy are well known diseases, of which the prominent feature consists in this poorness of blood. In the former malady we have found the blood corpuscles shrivelled, and even disintegrated ;f but it is difficult to determine whether this was due to a defect in their mode of generation and development, or to a diminished spe- cific gravity of the serum favourable to its endosmose by them.J * Monthly Journal of Med.

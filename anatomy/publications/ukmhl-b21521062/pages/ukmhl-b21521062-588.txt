In the male, puberty seldom occurs before the fourteenth or fifteenth year. It is marked by increased development of the genital organs, the formation of spermatozoa, and the occurrence of sexual feelings.

This alteration of the voice does not take place in eunuchs, who retain throughout life a shrill tone, of higher pitch, approximating more in character to the female voice than to that of the male. Perfectly-formed spermatozoa are not found in the genital organs of the male before the period of puberty. The power of procreation lasts much longer in the male than in the female, and often continues up to the sixtieth or sixty- fifth years j and instances of virility are recorded at the advanced age of one hundred. In the human female, puberty is likewise characterised by the occurrence of certain local changes in the generative organs, and also by changes of a more general character occurring in the body. About this time, which usually occurs between the thirteenth and sixteenth years, but somewhat earlier in hot climates, the organs of generation undergo a considerable increase in size; the breasts

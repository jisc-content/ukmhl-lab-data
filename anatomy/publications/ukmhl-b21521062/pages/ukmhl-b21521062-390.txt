6bJ, THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD, [chap, xxviii. hydroclynamic fact, as also with the results of other observations, of which those of Volkraann seem the most trustworthy. Volkmann shows that a fluid flowing through a system of tubes has to encounter at the point of its entrance into it the sum of the resist- ances which oppose it throughout the entire area, and these resist- ances determine the amount of pressure needed for its propulsion. Applying this to the arteries it is plain that in them the blood has to encounter the resistances in the capillaries, in the small arteries, in the middle-sized arteries, and in the arterial trunks, a fact, which by assigning to the resistance in each of these regions the symbols w, y, w, x representing that in the arterial trunks, and the other letters that in each of the remaining segments of the system, may be thus expressed, P (being the pressure in the commencement of the arterial tree) = x + ;i/ + z + w, whence it is plain that the amount of pressure cannot be the same in all parts of the arterial system, but diminishes steadily as the artery is more distant from the heart. Spengler's experiments so far disprove the accuracy of Poiseuille's statement as to show that the pressure of the blood differs consi- derably in different arteries ; but in the greater number of his observations the pressure appeared to be greater in the arteries more distant from the heart, some showing a difference of 36 mil- limetres in favour of the more distant artery; but in one of the instances quoted by Volkmann from Spengler there was a difference of 16 6 millimetres in favour of the carotid artery as compared with the maxillary. But Volkmann's very numerous observations, made with more perfect instruments than those used by Spengler, show a marked difference of pressure in the near, and in the distant arteries. Thus, eight observations on the carotid, and a branch of the femoral artery of a large dog, gave a mean of 7*2 millimetres (0*27 inch) in favour of the carotid. And ten observations on the carotid and metatarsal arteries of a calf yielded a mean of 27 millimetres (1"05 inch) in favour of the carotid ; and twelve observations on the same arteries of another calf gave a mean of 19'5 millimetres also in favour of the carotid. Volkmann has also shown, that in the same artery a notably greater pressui-e exists in the part near the heart than in that more remote from it, which is, of course, the more conspicuous, as the distance between the two points measured is greater.

The arrangement of the branches of the portal vein round one of the smallest lobules of the pig's liver, with a few of the lobular capillaries injected, is shown in Fig. 221. Hepatic Artenj.—Many branches of the artery pass to the cap- sule of the livei', in which they ramify abundantly, forming a net- work having large meshes. These capsular' branches and their anastomoses, are readily injected in the liver of the foetus or child. The artery gives off numerous branches in the portal canals. The greater number of these are distributed upon the coats of the ducts. The thick walls of the larger ducts are abundantly sup- plied with arterial blood; but the smaller branches of the duct, the coats of which are extremely delicate, pass through the meshes of an arterial network. In the pig this net-work may be demonstrated upon the surface of each lobule, Fig. 222, but in the human subject the branches are less numerous, and are seen only in the interlobular fissures; other branches supply the coats of the portal and hepatic veins. The greater quantity of blood, after passing through these small arteries, is collected by venous radicles which empty themselves into the branches of the portal vein. A few very small arterial branches may be traced from the portal aspect of the lobule for a short dis- tance into its interior, where they join the portal hepatic plexus Fio. 222. « Part of art°rli\l rinc, ivitli branches riimlfyinff i\poii the capsules of tlie lolmles of the piff's h b.

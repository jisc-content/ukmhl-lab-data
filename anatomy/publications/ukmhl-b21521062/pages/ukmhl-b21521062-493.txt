Situations at wliich the injection forced into the two vessels has met. I. Central parts of lobule not injected. of the portal vein, artery and duct, which run between the lobules, and by the areolar tissue which accompanies them; but not by any inosculation or coalescence of the ultimate secreting elenaeuts, the liver-cells, or the capillaries. In other animals, and in the human subject, the lobules are not thus isolated, but are only imperfectly mai'ked out by the several points of their exterior, to which the ultimate twigs of the portal vein and duct arrive. The twigs of the vein terminate in a plexus of capillaries common to all the contiguous lobules, and continuous between them, so that the lobules themselves have no definite limit (Fig. 219), but blend with each other, except at certain points of their exterior. It is not likely that these differences in the isolation of the lobules in various animals are of any physiological importance, but they have, probably, given rise to much of the difference of opinion which exists among anatomists on this subject. The shape of the lobules, whether completely defined by an investment of fibrous tissue, or merely mapped out by the position

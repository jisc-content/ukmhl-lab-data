Towards the termination of the period of pregnancy, the pla- centa becomes hard, and a curious change takes place in its capillary vessels, which has only been carefully investigated \\ithin. the last few years. The alteration consists in the appearance of a number of oil-globules in the coats of the vessels—in fact, in the occurrence of fatty degeneration of the fostal tufts. In a former page, we described a similar change taking place in muscular fibre- cells of the uterus, when the period of their activity was passed, and the organ was gradually returning to its former volume. The change alluded to has been looked upon by many pathologists as of a morbid nature, and has been brought forward as one of the causes of abortion; but the observations of our friend.

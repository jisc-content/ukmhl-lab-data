CORPORA LUTEA. 565 CHAP. XXXIX.] malian animal be examined soon after the escape of the ovum, it is found to be almost completely filled with an exxidation, similar to that which, by its ^adual increase in quantity, has caused the ovum to be carried to the surface of the follicle. In a short time, the outer portion of the follicle is occupied by a firm yellow sub- stance, which is probably formed from plasma, exuded from its walls. After many careful examinations, Dr. Lee has been led to conclude that this yellow matter is deposited external to both the membranes of the follicle.''^ Montgomery regards it as situated between the layers, while some authorities look upon the internal siu'face of the inner membrane as the precise seat of its formation. Dr. Zwicky considers the large cells, of which the yellow matter is composed, as modifications of the small cells of the immatui'e follicles. Their nuclei are large and well defined, and they contain numerous oil-globules in their interior. Although bodies, which are liable to be taken for corpora lutea, are, from time to time, found in the virgin ovary, a foetus has never been found in the uterus without the formation of an unmistakeable corpus luteum HaUer's remark, therefore, " nullus unquam conceptus est absque corpore luteo," although made so many years ago, may still be regarded as strictly true.

In the last chapter we described the earliest changes resulting from impregnation, and traced them up to the formation of the germinal membrane, and the first appearance of the embryo. We have now to consider the manner in which the development of the embryo takes place, and the mode in which the different organs are evolved. It will be most convenient to describe, as briefly as possible, the earliest changes occurring in the bird's egg, in the first instance, and then to consider the development of the mam- malian ovum, and that of the human subject. Early Changes in the Bii'd's Ovum.—In considering the nature of the earliest changes in the egg, resulting from impregnation, but which are dependent for their commencement and continuance upon a temperature varying from 95° to 104° F., we must premise that the yolk of the bird's egg consists of two distinct portions, one which undergoes segmentation, and alone takes part in the formation of the embryo — the germ-yolk; the other, and by far the larger portion, does not undergo segmentation, and takes no part in the formation of the germ, but provides the pabulum for its development and nutrition, whence it is termed the food-yolk. Area Pellucida, Area Germinitiva, and Area Vasculosa.—A few hours after the egg has been exposed to a hatching heat, it will be found that the germ has become less adherent to the vitelline membrane. It has assumed a more membranous appearance; and about the sixth or seventh hour, a clear space may be discerned in its centre.

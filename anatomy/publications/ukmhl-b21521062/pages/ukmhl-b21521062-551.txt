In the present state of our knowledge, perhaps no better hypothesis of the office of this gland can be suggested. The whole subject of the physiology of the vascular ductless glands (if glands they be) is involved in deep obscurity, and it is impos- sible to form a theory of their respective functions which is per- fectly satisfactory. Not less obscure are their morbid conditions, j upon which the improved anatomy of the last few years has thrown I but little light. The student is referred to the following works for a more detailed state- ment of the various views now held upon the anatomy and physiology of the vascular glands.

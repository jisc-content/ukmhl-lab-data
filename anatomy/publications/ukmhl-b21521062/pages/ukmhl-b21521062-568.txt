It passes behind the bladder, and terminates in one of the ejaculatory canals, a very short canal, which is formed by the union of the vas deferens with the corresponding vesicula seminalis, which is situated a little external to it, upon the posterior surface of the bladder. VesiculcB Seminales.â€”The vesiculai seminales are two sacculated receptacles, about two inches in length and about three-quarters of an inch in breadth, situated upon the posterior aspect of the bladder, lying between it and the rectum. They converge towards the point at which they open, and almost meet. The narrow terminal portion (duct) lies for a short distance, pre- vious to its opening in the urethra, surrounded by the prostate. Each vesicula may be unravelled, so as to form a csecal tube, with several diverticula projecting from it. It is very much convoluted, and the convolutions are connected together with areolar tissue, to which arrangement the sacculated appear- ance is due. The structure of the vesieulae seminales is very similar to that of the vasadeferen- tia, but their walls are much thinner. There is an outer coat, composed of areo- lar tissue, in which numerous muscular fibre cells are found. They are Uned with a thin layer of tesselated epithelium. The vesiculse are usually found to con- tain a -sdscid, mucus-like substance, which may be regarded as their secretion; and which, no doubt, is of a nature favorable to maintain the vital activity of the sper- matozoa, and serves also to dilute the semen. These organs were formerly looked upon as the receptacles for the semen; but a comparison of their arrangement, and an examination of their contents, in the lower vertebrata, by no means confirms this view, as our friend, Mr. Pittard, has re- marked. In the elephant, the vesicute seminales open into the vasa deferentia, as m man; but seminal reservoirs are also found in this animal. In man, however, spermatozoa are very generally found m them; and it is probable that they serve partly as receptacles for the semeu. Vesicula semiimlis, after E. H. AVeher. a.

Towards its termination in the upper part of the oviduct, d, the tube becomes straiglit and much nar- rowed, e. Magnified about 30 diameters, from a drawing of Dr. Beale's. voluted portion of the tube presents an excellent example of the spheroidal, or glandular variety. It consists of polyhedi-al particles rather less than yoq-^ of an inch in diameter, with a distinct nucleus, and containing numerous granules, and occupying as much as one-third or more of the total diameter of the tube. The extreme diameter of the convoluted tube is about of au inch, while the diameter of the central canal is not more than from yoVo to 9¥o of an inch.

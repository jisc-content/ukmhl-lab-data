The high development of raaii's intellect, as compared with that of the lower animals, would be of comparatively little advantage without his peculiar endowment of speech. To this power, an essential subsidiaiy is that of producing vocal sounds or voice; which, however, he enjoys in common with a large number of the lower classes. The phenomena of voice are produced by a very beautiful and simple mechanical contrivance, the larynx, which is placed at the top of the trachea, to take advantage, as an exciting force, of the air emitted from the lungs dui'ing expiration. The air thus expelled creates vibrations in certain tense and elastic membranes {chordae vocales), the boundaries of a chink Avhich is the orifice at once of entrance and of exit for the supply of air to the lungs. These vibrations generate voice. That the larnyx is the organ of voice is proved by the following very obvious facts:—first, the least alteration in the condition of the mucous membrane covering the vocal cords is invariably . accompanied by a change in the tone of the voice, e. g. hoarseness; secondly, ulcerative disease eating through one or both of these vocal cords destroys or gi'eatly impairs the voice; thirdly, opening the trachea below the vocal chords, so as to divert the current of air in expiration from the larynx, will destroy voice; and fourthly, section of the inferior laryngeal nerves, by which the influence of the will is brought to bear on its muscles, and so the tension of the vocal cords is regulated, destroys the voice; lastly, by experiment on the dead laiynx, soimds may be produced resembling those of

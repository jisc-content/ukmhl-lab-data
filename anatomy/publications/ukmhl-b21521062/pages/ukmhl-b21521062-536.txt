We have now to consider a remarkable class of organs present in all the mammalia, which resemble the secretory glands already described in external conformation and in the possession of a solid parenchyma, but differ from them in the absence j>f any excretory apparatus suitable for carrying off the products of secretion. These organs cannot be associated with such structures as the liver, the kidneys, and the other glands; inasmuch as they not only differ from them in the essential particular just mentioned; but they exhibit in their internal structure no mechanical arrangement clearly adapted to a secretory function; nor is any material (save in the case of the thymus) to be obtained from them bearing any resemblance to a secreted product. Many physiologists, how- ever, suppose that these organs do exert an attractive influence on certain matters in the blood, and separate them from it; but this hypothesis necessarily involves a second and a less plau- sible one, that the matter thus extracted must re-enter the cii'cu- lation. These bodies agree in the common characteristic, that their pa- renchymatous portion consists of cells and cell-nuclei, with blood- vessels in great number variously disposed. They may probably be regarded as appendages to the vascular system, and, from the absence of any excretory duct, they are usually designated vascular ductless glands', under this head are grouped—the spleen, the supra-renal capsules, the thyroid body and the thymus. Spleen.—The spleen is of an oval form and somewhat compressed;

INNERVATION. 148 [cHAV. xxr. of the body, the heart and the intestinal canal especially; it is also a sensitive nerve to these parts; and it presides over the actions of the blood-vessels of these as well as of other parts where it is dis- tributed, as of the head and neck, and likewise of all the principal glands of the body.* * On the Sympathetic nerve, consult Cruveilhier, An.it. Dcscr.; Valentin in Soemmerring, Anat.; Longet, Syst. Nerveux ; Lobstein, de nervi sympath. fabrica, &c.; Valentin de function, nerv. cerebr. et sympath.; iV'Ir. Beck, paper in the Phil. Trans, for 1846; Miiller's Physiology; Bidder und Volkmann, die Selb- standigkcit des sjTnpathischen Nervensystems, Leipzig, 1842; KoUiker, die Selb- standigkeit und Abhangigkeit des sympathischen Nervensystems, Zurich, 1844; Purkinje, in Miiller's Archiv. for 1845, and translated in the Lond. Med. Gazette, vol. xxxvi., has described nervous ramifications which he considers to belong to the sympathetic, in the pia mater, dura mater, serous membranes, and other parts. Mr. Rainey also describes (Med. Chir. Trans, vol. xxix.) the arachnoid and subarach- noid tissue as consisting almost entirely of such nerves, a view which it is impossi- ble for \is to adopt. Much yet remains to be cleared up as regards the anatomical history of the sympathetic nerve in particular parts. Monographs upon the nerves of the heart, of the stomach, the intestines, &c. are great desiderata, founded on careful and minute dissections, by experienced anatomists, with the aid of the mi- croscope. Further researches arc likewise required on its distribution in the extre- mities.

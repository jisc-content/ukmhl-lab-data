The red corpuscles consist, according to most chemists, of two elementary substances, globuline and hsematine, the former is nearly allied to, if not identical with albumen, and forms the solid part of the blood-corpuscle, its cell-wall, and nucleus, when it exists; the latter is the colouring material, or blood-pigment. The following process is recommended by Figuier for the separa- tion of the ha-matine from the globuline. Defibrinated blood should be mixed with at least four times its bulk of a saturated solution of sulphate of soda; the mixture must then be thrown on a filter : the fluid and some corpuscles pass through, leaving the mass of coloured particles on the filter. This must next be boiled in alcohol, slightly acidulated with sulphuric acid: the hsematine will be thus dissolved, the colourless globuline, in combination with some of the sulphuric acid, remaining un- dissolved. The next step in this process is to add to the hot solution of hjematine enough carbonate of ammonia to remove the sulphuric acid; the fluid must then be filtered, to remove the sulphate of ammonia thus formed, and the liquor must be exposed for eva- poration ; when, by this means, it is reduced one-twelfth of its

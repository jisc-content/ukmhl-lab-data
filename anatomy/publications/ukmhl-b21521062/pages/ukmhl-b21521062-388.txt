THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD. [ciia p. XXVIII. 360 The instrument is now adapted by means of a pipe provided with a stopcock (F) to the artery in whicli the blood is to be measured. On opening- the stopcock the blood rushes into the horizontal tube, mingles with the alkaline solution, and pushes down the mercury' in the vertical tube B', that in the tube B rising to the same extent Fig-. 201. Poiseuille's hamadynamometer as slightly modified by Volkmann:â€”A A' the hoard to which the bent glass tube (BB'B") is attached. CC'C" a tin tube which is fixed through a cork (D) air-tight to the horizontal branch of the glass tube, E an opening with a stopcock in this tube. F a conical tube which may be introduced into an artery or vein. This is provided with a stop- cock which serves to regulate the admission of the blood into the tube of the hiemadynamometer. G H G' an arm of wood connected with the board which serves to support the tin tube, and so protect the horizontal branch of the glass tube. as the first is depressed. The rise and fall of the mercury in each vertical branch can be measured on scales placed behind them, and as the rise and fall are equal, the double of either will give the height of a column of mercury which the force of the stream of blood is able to maintain. By causing the blood to press upon a column of mercury, Poiseuille got rid of the necessity of having a very long tube as used by Hales. Hales inferred, from his observations on the lower animals, and a comparison of the measurements of their arteries with those of man, that the force of the heart in the human subject is capable

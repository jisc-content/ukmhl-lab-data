66 INNERVATION. [chap, xviii. In Mammalia, tlie general characters and structure of the organ of hearing closely resemble those of man. In examining the anatomy of the human ear, we shall first de- scribe the external ear, next the middle ear, or tympanum, and lastly, the labyrinth. t'ig. 131. General view of the external, middle, and internal ear, as seen in a prepared section through (1, the auditory canal, b. The tym])anuni or middle ear. c. Eustachian tube, leading to the Eharynx. d. 'Cochlea; and e. Semicircular canals and vestibule, seen on their exterior, as rought into view by dissecting away the surrounding petrous bone. The styloid process pro- jects below; and the inner surface of the carotid canal is seen above the Eustachian tube. From Scarpa. The External Ear comprises the free, expanded part, auricle or pinna, and the auditory canal or external meatus. The auricle presents an outer surface, which is on the whole con- cave, and slightly inclined forwards. On this surface are several eminences and depressions, resulting from the folded, or rather crumpled, form of its cartilaginous basis, and which are seen re- versed on the free portion of the opposite surface. These are ;â€” a prominent rim or helix, and within it another curved prominence, the anthelix, which bifurcates above, so as to enclose a space, the scaphoid fossa, and describes a circuit round a deep, capacious, central cup, the concha. At the end of the helix, in front of the concha, is a small detached eminence, the tragus, so named from its bearing a tuft of hair resembling a goafs beard. Opposite this, be- hind and below the concha, is the a^ititragus. Below is the pen- dulous lole, composed of dense areolar and adipose tissues. The concha is imperfectly divided into an upper and a lower part by the

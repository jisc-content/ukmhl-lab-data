553 CHAP. XXXVIII.] OVUM. Fig. 2fi4. whicli is attached to the external clear membraue, or zonapellucida, of the ovum. This layer is termed by Dr. Barry, the tunica granu- losa. The so called retiuacula are composed of similar cells, of which many are also found floating in the fluid of the follicle, which is entirely lined by them. Ovum.—'l\ie ovum is invested with a clear, homogeneous, perfectly transparent, firm, elastic, and toler- ably thick membrane, exhibiting an appearance, when examined by the microscope, very similar to that of the elastic laminae of the cornea, the vitelline or ijolk membrane, or zona pellucida; the latter being the term always employed in speaking of the mammalian ovum. The zona pellu- cida appears as a perfectly clear ring, limited on either side by a well de- fined dark outline. Within this mem- brane is the yolk, which is composed of a fluid containing proper yolk granules and oil particles, with the clear bright germinal vesicle, contain- ing within it the gei-minal spot, lying close beneath the zona pellucida. The ovum is about x^th, and the germinal spot about jo'V"o^^^ -g^o-th Mammalian ova. The upper rtsnre shows of an inrh in rliampfpr Pru f'."" "'^''^^ ^^^^ development, ui ttu luuil lU UldmCLKr.

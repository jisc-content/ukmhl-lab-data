391 THE HUMAN LUNGS. CHAP. XXIX.] perform the same function. They are a series of branched celhilated air-passages, not lined with epithelium, or coated with muscular tissue, but highly extensible and elastic, of much larger aggregate capacity than the terminal bronchia which lead to them, and re- sembling closely, in general conformation, the reptilian lung. In- deed, an admirable notion of the essential arrangement of the lobules of the mammalian lung may be derived from an examination of the terminal parts of the sacculated bronchia of the lung of the turtle. The lobular passages are wider than the terminal bronchia of which they are the continuations, and than the cells which pullulate on their walls. They also branch again and again in order to spread from the terminal bronchial tube on every hand throughout the whole area of the lobule, and as their ramifications observe no certain order or course, it happens that sections carried through the lobules are rarely found to follow any single passage far, so as to display, in a happy manner, its mode of distribution. Sometimes, however, this is better seen than at others. M.EossignoI has recently given an elaborate description of the pul- monary structure. He insists particularly on the ultimate bronchial ramifications being in shape like an inverted funnel, and he terms them the infuncUhula. The cells, forming a honeycomb on their interior, he calls the alveoli (figs. 205 and 206). Emphysema, Fig. 205. riiin slice from the pleural surface of a cat's lung, considcraljly magnified. At the thin cdee â€¢d,alve,,U are seen. In the centre (as a) where the sUce is tliicker, alveoli are seen on the wi'lb mfundibula. From liossignul. according to this author, seems to consist in a distension of the passages and cells, and a breaking down and obliteration of the septa, first between the cells of the same passage and then

RESPIRATION. [chap. XXIX. 416 The great objects of respiratiou are, first, the introduction of oxygen, by which the products resulting from the disintegration of tissues are converted into compounds, which are easily eliminated from the body by the different organs of secretion; and secondly, the removal of the most important and most destructive of these, carbonic acid, at the pulmonary surface.* * Upon the subjects discussed in the present chapter, reference may be made to the following works:—Article " Respiration," by Dr. John Reid, Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology; " Thorax," by Dr. Hutchinson ; Physiological, Anatomical, and Pathological Researches, by Dr. John Reid ; Recherches sur la Structure intime du Poumon.

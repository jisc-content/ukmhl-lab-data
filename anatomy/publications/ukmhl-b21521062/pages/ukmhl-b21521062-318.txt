The blood is a fluid, which is always circulatliig in numberless canals among the various tissues and organs of the body ; it is the source whence those tissues and organs draw their nutriment, and from which the glands derive the materials for their several secre- tions. The lymph and the chyle are poured into it as tributary streams ; the former conveying to it, in solution, materials yielded up by the wear and tear of the tissues, and also derived from without; the latter bringing to it new matter formed by the digestive process. The blood is a thick fluid, apparently homogeneous, of high specific gravity (1041â€”1082, Simon,) and of a red colour, in all the vertebrate and most of the invertebrate classes, but exhibiting differences of colour, according to circumstances to be noticed here- after. A saltish taste, and a peculiar heavy odour, must also be reckoned among its characters. If allowed to i*est in a cup, or other vessel, it exhibits a remarkable spontaneous analysis. In the course of from ten minutes to half an hour it separates into a solid portion (the crassamentum) and a fluid portion (the serum). The latter, if carefully decanted off", will be found to be a clear straw-coloured fluid, the menstruum of that great variety of mate- rials which is held in solution or suspension in the blood. Albumen in large quantity, salts, and various organic matters, are dissolved in it ; oily maf ters are suspended in it; and pv'iov to coagulation fibriue is held in solution, and coloured and other particles are diff'used in infinite multitudes throughout it. An artificial physical analysis of the blood, first suggested by Miiller, shows satisfactorily the true relation of its various con- stituents. If the blood of an animal whose coloured particles are

CHAP. XLII.I OF HEART AND AORTIC ARCHES. 603 About the sixth day, a considerable alteration takes place in the circulation. By this time, the allautois forms a vesicle of consi- derable size, upon the surface of which numerous vessels are spread out. These are derived from two branches resulting from the division of the aorta after it has given off the mesenteric artery. The allautois rapidly increases in size; and as the albumen dimi- nishes in quantity, it becomes applied to the membrane of the egg- shell. Through the latter, and through the pores of the shell itself, the air passes to aerate the blood circulating in the vessels of the allautois, which may therefore be looked upon as the great respiratory sui'face of the chick previous to the formation of lungs. About the sixth or seventh day, the heart acquires its character- istic form; its cavities have approximated more closely, and become conjoined; the division between the auricles and ventricles can be seen distinctly. The bulb of the aorta appears to arise from both ventricles, immediately over the septum; and its division into two canals is complete on the seventh day. The pericardium is formed. Only two vascular arches arise on the left side of the aorta, but on Fig. 284. 1,2,3. Heart of chick at the 45th, 65th, and 85th hours of incubation. After Dr. Allen Thomson.- 4.

The latter, and the two anterior arches, are the chief divisions of the aorta, and receive the blood transmit- ted from the left ventricle. On the seventh day, the two posterior arches receive blood only from the right ventricle, and become the pulmonary arteries. At present, however, all the arches terminate in the descending aorta. At this period, the com-se of the blood is as follows:—From the system of the embryo it is carried by the arteria vitellincE, or omphalo-mesenterica;, to the net-work of vessels of the vascular area, whence it passes to the sinus terminalis, which bounds the latter,' and which, even on the fourth day, is found to be full of blood' The blood is returned to the heart by two anterior and two pos- terior venous trunks, arranged in pairs on each side of the median R II 2

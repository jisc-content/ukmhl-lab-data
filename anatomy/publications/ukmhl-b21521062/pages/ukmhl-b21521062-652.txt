DEVELOPMENT. [CHAP. XLlli. months of pregnancy. The contraction of the thick muscular walls of the uterus tends to force the head upon the os uteri, in consequence of which the cii-cular fihres of the latter gradually relax, and the opening dilates. The membranes are pressed towards the vagina, and protrude through the os, until at length they burst, and the liquor amnii escapes. At each successive pain, the child's head is forced lower and lower into the vagina. The pains increase in force and frequency, and the uterine contractions are assisted by the voluntary contrac- tions of the abdominal muscles; until at last, in a violent paroxysm of pain, the head is born, and the remainder of the child very quickly follows. A little haemorrhage usually occurs immediately after the birth of the child, in consequence of the partial detachment of the pla- centa. This is followed, however, by contractions; and the placenta itself is forced into the vagina shortly after the birth of the child. With the placenta are also expelled portions of the membrana decidua, the remains of the chorion, and the amnion. After labour, a considerable quantity of foetid discharge takes place from the uterus. At first, this is composed principally of blood; but afterwai'ds it becomes paler, and consists chiefly of mucus, Avith pus corpuscles, and a certain quantity of fluid exuda- tion. The uterus gradually returns to its former volume. For information upon the questions discussed in the present chapter, the student is referred to the works previously enumerated.

78 INNERVATION. [chap. XVIII. surface of the osseous zone, including the denticulate lamina, is con- vex, rising from the free series of teeth towards the modiolus. Fig. 138.

Outer clear belt of membranous zone, torn from the cochlearis muscle Magnified 300 diameters. In the groove already mentioned there is a series of elongated bodies, not unlike columnar epithelium, in which the nuclei are very faint. These bodies are thick and cubical at one end, and taper much towards the other. They are united in a row; and it is possible they may have some analogy to the club-shaped bodies of Jacob's membrane. We can assign them no use. Continuous with the thin margin of the osseous zone is the membranous sone. This is a transparent glassy lamina, having some resemblance to the elastic lamina? of the cornea, and the capsule of the lens. A narrow belt of it next the osseous zone is smooth, and exhibits no internal structure, while in the rest of its width it is marked by a number of very minute straight lines, radiatino- outwards from the side of the modiolus. These lines are very delicate at their commencement, become more strongly

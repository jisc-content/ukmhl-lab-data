586 DEVELOPMENT. [chap. XLI. The primitive streak is formed in the serous or animal layer of the germinal membrane, beneath the investing membrane of Rei- chert. Bischoff has shown, that in the mammalian ovum the germinal membrane becomes divided into two lamina, as in the Fiy. 276.

The external lamina is the serous, or animal layer^ and the internal one is the mucous or vegetative layer. The middle layer, or membrane intermedia, described by Reichert, has already been alluded to in page 582, but according to BischofiF is not to be de- tected in the mammalian ovum. Formation of Dorsal and Ventral Lamince.â€”In a short time the cephalic extremity becomes enlarged, and the entire embryo of a guitar-shape in its general outline. As soon as the primitive groove is formed, two oval folds are seen to rise up on each side of it from the serous laminae (c?. fig. 276). These are the lamince dorsales, which gradually approximate; and the groove between them becomes converted into a canal which contains the central organs of the nervous system. Reichert supposes that the laminae dorsales actually take part in the formation of the central parts of the nervous system; but Bischoff considers that they represent the dorsal portion of the embryo, and that the nervous system is developed from their lower

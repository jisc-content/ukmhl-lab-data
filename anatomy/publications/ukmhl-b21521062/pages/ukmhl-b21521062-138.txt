110 INNERVATION. [CHAI'. XIX, We may then conclude from human and comparative anatomy, from experiment and pathological states, that the ninth nerve is the motor nerve of the tongue. Its anastomoses with the vagus, and with the fifth, make it probable that it contains some sensitive fila- ments, and this is confirmed by experiments Avhich shew that some sensibility is possessed by the nerve, and that this is greatest the nearer we approach the tongue. But that it has no influence upon taste or upon the common sensibility of the organ, is proved by the unimpaired state of both those powers, after comjjlete section of the nerve.* * In addition to the principal systematic works on physiology, reference may be made to Valentin, de Functionibus Nerv.

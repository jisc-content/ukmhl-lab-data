The resulting areolte, which in the sclerotic are irregular, and on all sides open, are converted in the cornea into tubular spaces, which have a very singular arrangement, hitherto undescribed. They lie in superposed planes, the contiguous ones of the same plane being for the most part parallel, but crossing those of the neighbouring planes at an angle, and seldom communi- cating with them (fig. 110). The arrange- ment and size of these tubes can be shown by driving mercury, or coloured size, or air, into a small puncture made in the cornea. They may also be shown under a high power by moistening a thin section of a dried cornea, and opening it out by needles. The tissue forming the parietes of these tubes is membranous rather than fibrous, though with the best glasses a fibrous striation may be frequently seen, both in the laminae separating the different series of tubes, and in that dividing those of the same layer from each other. By acetic acid, also, the structure swells, and displays corpuscles resembling those ap- parent in the white fibrous tissue. Such is the lamellar structure of the cornea, which makes it so much easier to thrust an instrument horizontally than vertically into its substance. The tubes or elongated spaces of which we have spoken, are not distended with any fluid, but are merely moistened in the same way as the areolae of ordinary areolar tissue. A perfectly fresh and transparent cornea is rendered opaque by pressure, but it regains its bril- liance on the removal of the compressing force. from the expulsion of fluid from between f t7,c''r4e;i V/X'^rl^ef projer: its.laminae; but that the opacity is owing TpoL^rlt^ d^^^^^^^^^ A.

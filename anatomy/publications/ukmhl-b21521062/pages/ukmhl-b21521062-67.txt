CHAP, XVII.] 39 THE OPTIC NERVES. nerve of the opposite side, decussating the similar fibres of the other tract; and the outermost fibres, much feiver in number than the cen- tral ones, pass to the optic nerve of the same side. This disposition of the fibres of the chiasma may be demonstrated on a specimen which has been sufficiently hardened in spirit, by tearing the fibres in their proper direction after the removal of the neurilemma. By such a procedure it may be shown that each optic nerve derives its principal fibres from the tract of the opposite side, and only a few fibres from those of its own side. The existence of such a decussation of fibres in the chiasma is, moreover, rendered highly probable by the strong indications of most extensive decussation, resembling that of the anterior pyra- mids, in some of the large carnivorous birds, and also in the cross- ing of the entire optic nerves in some of the osseous fishes, the cod for example. In the common domestic quadrupeds the decussation of the fibres is not to be made out so plainly, probably from its being more com- plicated. The chiasma somewhat resembles a knotted union of the two tracts, which is dense and firm in structure. The optic nerves appear also to be connected by fibres, forming the anterior border of the chiasma, and which may be regarded as commissural between the two retinae (a, fig. 126). From the quadrigeminal tubercles to the chiasma, nerve-tubes, mostly of large size, are visible by the microscope in the tracts. In the chiasma and the optic nerves, the fibres, although very variable in size, are so closely connected together that it is exceed- ingly difficult to separate them. They seem to be collected into numerous small bundles, having an intricate plexiform interlacement \\ U i within the common sheath.

The optic nerve is abundantly supplied with capillaries, which form a network with elongated meshes in its substance. A little behind the globe, it receives from the ophthalmic artery a branch, before alluded to, the arteria centralis retinee, which penetrates to

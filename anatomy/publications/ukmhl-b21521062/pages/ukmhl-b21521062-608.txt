580 GENERATION. [chap. XL. The tufts or villi of the chorion, each of which consists of a col- lection of nucleated cells within a delicate membrane, are the organs by which this nutriment is at first absorbed, just as the col- lections of cells at the terminations of the minute divisions of the root of the plant absorb and appropriate nutriment from the soil. Soon, however, vessels are prolonged from the foetus into these tufts, and thenceforward it continues to be nourished from the vascular system of the mother; but the nutrient matter is still transmitted through the layer of cells covering the vascular maternal surface, as well as that covering the foetal tuft. The precise nature of this arrangement we shall have to consider when discussing the mode of formation of the placenta.

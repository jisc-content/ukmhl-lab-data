MIDDLE COAT OF ARTERIES. CHAP. XXVIII.] 319 interlacement which is represented in fig. 187. This disposition of the fibres may be particularly well seen on thin sections made from the dried aorta of the ox, and afterwards moistened with acetic acid. It is also sufiicieutly obvious in the aorta of the human subject, but the fibres are all very much smaller, nearly one- half the size of those of the ox, and the penniform subdivision is not so distinct. Muscidar Fibres.—Interposed between the layers of penniform fibres we find some of the wavy white Fig. 189. Fig. 188.

These do not seem to form any single uniform layer, but are disposed probably on different planes (some- what like the fibres of the dartos in the areolar tissue of the scrotum) among the fibres of the circular fibrous coat, and follow the same direction.

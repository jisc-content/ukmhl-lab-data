The mucous membrane is thickest where the tubes are most developed, namely, in the jejunum. Lieberkuhn's follicles are doubtless secreting agents, resembling in that respect the tubes of the ^.^ stomach. Probably their office, in reference to the intestinal contents, is the same through- out the whole intestinal tube, as they present everywhere so much uniformity of arrange- ment and structure, and as each portion of the intestine pos- sesses other and peculiar glands. As yet, however, nothing is known respecting the nature of the mucus which is secreted by them.

Of the ValvulcE Conniventes, Folds, and Villi.—The mucous mem- brane of the small intestine exhibits numerous folds, which, small, irregular, and resembling the rugaj of the stomach in the superior third of the duodenum, assume a much more definite form, and are much more highly developed in the remaining portions of the small intestine, but especially in the jejunum. The irregular foldings of the upper portion of the duodenum very soon exhibit the tendency to assume a transverse direction with reference to the axis of the intestine. In the middle and inferior portions of the duodenum we find numerous transverse plaitings or folds from one-eighth to a quarter of an inch in depth. These are simple folds of the compound mucous membrane, including a process of the submucous areolar tissue—they are called valvulee connimntes, from their valvular form, and from their movements under water resembling the flapping of valves, or the winking motion of the eyelids. Each fold passes round the intestine for

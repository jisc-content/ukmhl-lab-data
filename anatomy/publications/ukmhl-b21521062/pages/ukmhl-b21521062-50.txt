The capillary network of the inner surface is so close that there is no room for pigment-cells in its interstices; but between it and the ar- teries and veins, as well as among the veins themselves, there is a great abundance of colouring matter, which deeply tinges the whole thickness of the membrane. The pigment-cells in the sub- ,. #^J^ yi «?W stance of the choroid (fig. 114, u) are extremely irregular in shape, and lie in various direc- tions amongst the other ele- mentary tissues.

The stapes, or stirrup bone, s, is almost sufficiently described by its name. Its construction is truly elegant. It has a head, necJc, ttvo branches, and a base. The last fits into the fenestra ovalis, to the margin of which it is attached, by membrane, so as to enjoy some freedom of motion. Its neck receives the insertion of the stapedius muscle.

Each of these muscles consists of striped fibres. The internal muscle of the malleus, or tensor tympani, occupies the canal above the osseous portion of the Eustachian tube. It is attached in front to the under surface of the petrous bone, and to the cartilage of the Eustachian tube; it proceeds backwards, and ends in a tendon which turns abruptly outwards from the osseous canal in which the muscle is lodged, and is inserted into the short process of the malleus. It draws this part inwards, and thus heightens the tension of the membrana tympani. An anterior mus- cle of the malleus, or laxator tympani muscle, is described by many anatomists as passing from the Glaserian fis,sure to the processus gracilis. The stapedius muscle occupies the conical interior of the pyramid; its surface is aponeurotic, its interior fleshy, and it ter- minates in a small tendon which emerges at the apex of the pyramid, and then passes to be inserted into the neck of the stapes. In con- tjraction it would fix the stapes by pulling its neck backwards. It probably compresses the contents of the vestibule. Of the Internal Ear, or Labyrinth.—This is the potential part

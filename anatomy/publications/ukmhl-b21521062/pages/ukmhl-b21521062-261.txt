Its precise relation to the elements of the raucous membrane cannot be exactly determined ; its wall seems to be formed of a structure dis- tinct from the basement layer of that membrane. It projects among Lieberkiihn's tubes, and, in the small intestine, is concealed and covered by the villi of the mucous membrane. Within it is con- tained a variable quantity of nuclei and granular particles, which, in the present state of our knowledge, must be viewed as a secre- tion. How this secretion is discharged is a matter of uncertainty, as no orifice has as yet been clearly demonstrated, hence some anatomists regard these glands as closed vesicles, which burst Avhen distended to a certain point.

Peter's glands/' — These may be regarded as aggregations of solitary glands, forming circular or oval patches situated on the free border of the intestine (fig. 166). They belong particularly • The glands, so long known by this title, may be called " Grcw's glands" with as much justice. They were discovered in several animals by our countryman, Dr. Nelicmiah Grew, who also delineated them with great accuracy, and described them in his lectures to the Royal Society, in the year 1C76, before Pcyer's book was published (1677). Dr. Grew's descriptions and delineations may be found m an essay appended to his catalogue of the museum of the Royal Society, of which he was Curator, entitled « The Comparative Anatomy of the Stomach and Guts begun."

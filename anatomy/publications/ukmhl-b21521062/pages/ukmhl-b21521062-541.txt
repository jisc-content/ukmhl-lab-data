CHAP. XXXV.I SPLENIC ARTERY. 513 i Mr. Gray lias shown that many of the capillary vessels are not i directly continuous with the A^eins, but that the blood, in passing from one set of vessels to the other, traverses intercellular spaces , in the spleen pulp. The veins also, in many cases, appear to com- i mence in intercellular spaces, so that it is not difficult to conceive how the contents of the vessels extravasate into, and become mixed with, the constituents of the pulp, especially when the organ is distended with blood. These changes appear also to take place . to a more limited extent within the veins themselves. Although this may be the correct explanation of the manner in which the cells in the pulp communicate with the blood in the vessels, we cannot look upon it by any means as demonstrative. Splenic Artery.â€”The splenic artery is the largest branch of the cseliac axis, and the size of this vessel in proportion to the organ to Fig. 248. Transverse section nf the human spleen, sho-wing the mode of distribution of tlic arteries, and the manner in which their slieatlisare formed. After Mr. H. Gray. which it is distributed, is considerably larger than that of other glands, with the exception of the thyroid. The large size of the vessel would lead to the inference that more arterial blood is distributed to the spleen than is required for the mere purposes of nutrition. The branches of the artery are invested with sheaths derived from and continuous with the fibrous capsule of the organ, and they have a similar structure to it. Each arterial branch is distri- buted to a particular part of the organ, and it does not anastomose with contiguous branches. The smaller arteries, about the -^-^ of an inch in diameter, are connected with the Malpighian bodies, which are usually placed in the points of bifurcation of the vessel.'

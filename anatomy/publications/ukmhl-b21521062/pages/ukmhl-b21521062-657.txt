MILKT. 629 CHAP. XLIV.] quantity of saccharine and oily materials. In it albumen is often, detected. This is called the colostrum. The specific gravity varies from 1020 to 1045. The oil existing in milk, occurs in a state of minute division, in the form of oil-globules, which are equally diffused throughout the fluid. These oil-globules are each invested with a delicate membranous envelope, composed of caseine, which prevents their running together. If milk and ether be shaken and well mixed, the oily constituents are not dissolved, in consequence of the envelope of caseine with which they are invested; but if, previous to the addition of the ether, a little acetic acid or alkali, or alkaline salt, which has the power of dissolving the covering, be added, the globules are immediately dissolved, and the milk becomes perfectly clear. By churning, the envelopes are rup- tured, and the oil-globules are made to run together, forming butter. If the slightly turbid solution from which the cream has been removed be allowed to stand for some time, or if an acid be added to it, a floccvJent precipitate occurs. This is caseine, which is coagulated by all acids. It is, however, not coagulated by heat; but during evaporation, a scum forms upon the surface of solutions containing caseine.

Cow's milk contains more caseine and less sugar than human milk. Ass's milk contains less butter and less caseine, but more sugar; while in goat's milk the caseine preponderates over the other constituents. L'Heretier has shown that temperament exerts an influence upon the character of the milk. The averao-e quantity of solid matter in 1000 parts of milk from fair Avomen, was 120 grains ; and of brunettes, as much as 134 grains. The characters of the milk, also, it need hardly be said, are

DIGESTION. 228 [chap. XXV. the same elements exist in both, basement membrane, epithehum, sub-basement tissue, which occupies, along with vessels and perhaps nerves, the interior of the villus. The difference be- Fig. 159. tween the two structures is that the epithelium is in the interior of the fol- licle and on the exterior of the villus. A single layer of the co- lumnar epithelium covers each villus (fig. 159). The particles adhere by their sharp extremities to the basement membrane, and their bases, packed together, present on the surface an appearance of a pavement. ^" ^- The basement mem- A.

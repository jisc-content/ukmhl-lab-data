The characters of the speimatozoa vary much in different animals ; thus in the rat and mouse the head or body is un- pig. 26I. symmetrical and curved. In the squirrel, the anterior extremity of the head is rounded, and wider than any other portion. In birds, the head is usually attenuated. In reptiles and fishes, the characters of the spermatozoa vary much in different examples. Among the invertebrata, those of the Crustacea are very remarkable in form. For a detailed account of the characters of the sf)erma- tozoa in different classes of animals, we must refer the reader to the excellent ar- ticle. Semen, in the CyclopEedia of Anatomy and Physiology, by "Wagner and Leuckart. Development of the Spermatozoa.—The development of the sperma- tozoa has been carefully investigated" by Wagner, Siebold, and KoUiker. The different stages are traced more readily in many of the lower animals than in man. In the rabbit, Kolliker has been able to observe the single spermatic filament within the cell attached to the wall and making two or three turns in a spiral form. It may now be looked upon as almost certain, that each spermatozoon is developed, not from any change of the cell, but from the contents within the cell itself. These cells are themselves developed in the interior of a larger or mother cell, into the interior of which the spermatozoa es- cape by the ruptiu-e of their developing cells, and are at last set free by the destruction of the wall of the parent cell itself. Professor Kolliker, iu. his latest Development of the spermatic fila- ' ments of the rabbit, a. Parent cell, mvestigations, has arrived at the conclu- ^""^ nuclei. 6.

In this case, they arrange themselves parallel to each other, the heads being in one direction and the tails in the opposite. Movements of the Spermatic Filaments.—When the spermatozoa have escaped, their active movements commence; and by the con- tinual vibrations of the filamentous taU, they are propelled forwards, according to Henle, at the rate of one inch in seven minutes and a

A small lobule from the pig's liver, showinp; a. the interlobular branelies of the portal vein, and 6. a portion of the lobular eapillury network within the capsule injeetel. Each branch is seen to give off small branches on either side to the adjacent lobules. After Dr. Beale. the name of Glisson's capsule, from its discoverer, has been stated by many subsequent Avriters, to be prolonged into every part of the gland, separating the lobules from each other, and forming an invest- ment for each,—a description which we have failed to verify in every mammalian animal which we have examined, except the pig, where this areolar tissue is really prolonged between the lobules. Portal Vein.—The large portal vein is formed by the union of the veins of the stomach and intestines, the pancreatic and splenic veins and the veins of the mesentery, omentum, and gall bladder. The portal circulation has been described in p. 347, and we have, therefore, only to describe the distribution of the vein in the liver. The branches of the portal vein may be said, in general terms, to be arranged round the lobules; but the branches upon different sides do not anastomose so as to encircle each lobule with a venous ring, as many authors, following Kiernan's diagram, have described and represented, but communicate with each other only through the intervention of capillaries. Even in the pig there is no vascular ring, although to the naked eye it might appear so. In the liver of the human subject, and in livers allied to it, small branches of the portal vein can often be traced from the inter- lobular fissures into the lobule, breaking up into capillaries as

In specimens whieli have been carefully injected from the artery, not unfrequently it will be found that the coloured material escapes and extravasates from the vessels of the tuft into the cavity of the capsule, and thence runs down the tube (Fig. 231). In disease, it is not at all uncommon to find the capsule of the tuft, and the tube itself, injected with nlood, in consequence of hjEmorrhage from the vessels of the tuft. The difficulty of injecting the capsule by forcing injection from the pelvis of the kidney, cannot reasonably be urged as an objec- tion to this view, for all who have had any experience in in- jecting the minute ducts of glands, will agree that it is in very few instances indeed that the injection can be forced to the termination of the tube. The epithelium within it is apt to be forced towards its csecal extremity, and by its accumu- lation renders such a result impossible, while, in the ma- jority of cases, the force requi- site to overcome the resistance to the passage of fluid, along a highly convoluted tube in the reverse direction to that which ^^ ,c.^ ^ . its contents naturally take, is Malpignian tuft; kidney of the Proteus angnmeus, . *' showing vessels lying ivithin the capsule, the inner mOrC tliaU Sufficicut tO CaUSC itS surface of which is entirely ciiveved with a single layer of tesselated epithelium . a.

In the kidney of the frog, or of the newt, the continuity of the capsule with the basement membrane of the tube is exceedingly distinct and easy of demonstration. The tuft of vessels is seen lying naked within the capsule, uncovered either with epithelium or by any reflection of the basement membrane composing the capsule. In the frog, the neck of the tube close to and some way within the capsule is lined with ciliated epithelium, which con- rupture. The kidney of the horse is

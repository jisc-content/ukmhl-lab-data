Impregnation of the Ovum. — It is exceedingly difficult to give a satisfactory description of the nature of the phenomena occurring in impregnation. It was recently held, by Mr. Newport and other observers, that the contact of the spermatozoa with the exterior of the ovum was sufficient to impregnate it. It Avas supposed, that liquefaction of the spermatozoa occurred, and that the solution thus formed permeated the vitelline membrane, and impregnated the ovum. The latest researches, however, of the same indefatigable investigator upon the ovum of amphibia, and upon the mammalian ovum, have demonstrated satisfactorily that the spermatozoa actually penetrate and pass through the yolk membrane, and are thus brought into contact with the yolk in the interior. This view was advocated by Dr. Barry several years ago (in 1843), and its accuracy has since been coufirmed by the ob- servations of Newport and BischoflF, and also by Meissner. What becomes of the spermatozoa when they have reached the interior is unknown. They disappear, and become liquefied; but the precise manner in which this occurs has not been determined, neither is it known if they penetrate far into the substance of the yolk. Micropyle.—In many ova the A^telline membrane is very firm and hard; and it may be fairly asked, how can the delicate sper- t matozoa perforate so tough a structure as the investing membrane of the yolk undoubtedly is in these ova? Much light has very lately been thrown upon this part of the process of impregnation by the researches of our friend. Dr. Ransom, of Nottingham, by those of Professors Miiller and Remak upon the impregnation of the ova in fishes, and by the investigations of Leuckart, Le}'dig, and Meissner, upon the eggs of insects, moUusks, and some of the radiata.

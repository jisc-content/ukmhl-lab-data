ON MAKING POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 782 the inner eai' be desired, the loose bits of the "petrous bone" might be again divided in various directions according to the demands of the case. This metliod, while confessedly crude, may be of some value where circumstances do not permit of more systematic ex- ploration. The Eye. The removal of the eye, when it is not deemed important to extirpate the entire globe, can be easily accomplished by breaking through the brittle orbital plate, and dividing the eyeball transversely immediately behind the corneo-scleral junction. The eyeball, thus mutilated, is then lifted from its bed, the insertion of the peri-ocular muscles divided, and the nerve severed. The Bones. It often becomes necessary to saw the long bones longitudinally. The selected bone should be fixed in a vise, and the section made by the ordi- nary saw of the post-mortem case. If a gig-saw be available, especially one run by steam-power, the operator will save much time and trouble by secur- ing the assistance of a workman skilled in the use of such a machine. The section by this means is made with great celerity and precision in any desired di- rection.

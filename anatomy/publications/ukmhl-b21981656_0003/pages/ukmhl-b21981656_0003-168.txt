THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 152 [CHAP. LXXXVI. of cells from the blood-vessels into the alveoli take place, and the lung-tissue itself is the seat of inflammatory infiltration. In process of time new fibrous tissue is formed both within the alveoli and in the interalveolar septa (Art. 598, Fig. 228). In this way more or less extensive fibroid induration of the lung takes place: in many places it is transformed into a dense airless mass of fibrous tissue, usually containing pigment (Fig. 230); in other parts the alveolar walls are thickened (b) or infiltrated with cells, or the alveoli are filled with leucocytes or new-formed cellular tissue (c).

But where the development of fibrous tissue in the alveoli or their walls has begun, the lung is dense, firm, airless, and fleshy, having something of the appearance of freshly hepatised lung. The condition is well described as carnification. When the fibroid transformation is complete the tissue is firm and continuous, and white or slaty-grey in colour. The extent of the induration left by an antecedent pneumonia varies very greatly. It may be limited to the stratum immediately beneath the pleura, or extend over the greater part of a lobe. It may be continuous, that is uninterrupted by islands of air-containing tissue, or it may take the form of fibrous bands traversing the parenchyma in various directions and not very sharply marked off

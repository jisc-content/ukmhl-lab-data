ART. G64.] DURA MATER, PINEAL BODY, PITUITARY BODY. 325 Most tumours of the dura mater are sarcomatous. The spiudle-celled forms are the most frequent, but round-celled and multiform-celled types are also found. We also meet with alve- olar sarcomata and endotheliomata, characterised by the formation of cell-nests and reticulated strings of cells (Fig. 284 cd) within a fibrous stroma (a). These latter take the form of flattened or pedunculated fungoid outgrowths (fungus durae matris), varying from the size of a pea to that of an apple, which grow inwards and indent the surface of the brain or cord. On the outer aspect of the dura they erode and even perforate the bone by continuous pressure and consequent atrophy. They are com- monest within the cranium, being indeed rare in the spinal canal. The pedicle sends out root-like processes of cells into the substance of the dura mater, from which the growth evidently originates. The endothelium of the lymphatic vessels furnishes the characteristic clusters and strings of cells, and the latter are often excavated (d) in a way that immediately suggests the parent vessel. This appearance is visible chiefly in the recent parts of the growth, Fig. 284. Endothelioma of the dura mater.

When tumours of the dura mater become very vascular they may assume some of the characters of angioma; if the vessels calcify and give rise to an abundant production of brain-sand the growth becomes a psammoma.

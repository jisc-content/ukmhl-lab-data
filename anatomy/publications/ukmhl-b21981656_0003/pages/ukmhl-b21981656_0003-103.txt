AKT. 565.] MORBID CHANGES IN THE SUPRARENALE 87 The tumour oftenest observed in the suprarenals is that described by Virchow as struma lipomatosa suprarenalis: it is a nodular growth consisting essentially of fatty glandular tissue. Carcinoma and sarcoma also occur, the latter often reaching a very large size. Suprarenal cysts have also been described by various observers. They are formed either by the softening of haemorrhagic patches, or by the dilatation of the cortical acini (Klebs). These true cysts must not be confounded with the cavities very frequently observed in the glands, which are due to post-mortem softening of the inner layers of the cortex. The Echinococcus is the only animal parasite met with in the suprarenals. Disease of the suprarenals, especially the caseous fibroid degeneration, is often accompanied by bronzing of the skin (cutis aenea) and buccal mucous membrane, and by a profound and fatal cachexia. The pigmentation is sometimes uniform and diffuse, sometimes in patches and streaks. The bronzing and the cachexia are supposed to depend on the suprarenal lesion ; the affection being referred to as melasma suprarenale or Addison's disease. In many cases changes in the abdominal sympathetic nerves and ganglia have been observed. No satisfactory explanation of the relation of the several phenomena has yet been given.

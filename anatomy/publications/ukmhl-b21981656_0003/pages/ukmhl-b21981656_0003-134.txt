CHAPTER LXXXI STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE LUNGS. 584. The parenchyma of the lung is composed essentially of the terminal bronchioles and alveoli and of blood-vessels, together with a certain amount of connective tissue which unites the ultimate branches of the bronchi into lobules and marks them off one from another. The transition from the air-tubes to the respiratory parenchyma is very gradual, the bronchial walls changing in structure by slow degrees and ultimately becoming sacculated. The bronchi sub- divide dichotomously into ever finer branches, and it is the finest terminal branches or bronchioles which go to form the respiratory parenchyma. At first the sacculations or alveoli occur singly (Fig. 219 B), and then in small groups on one side of the bronchiole. Fia. 219. Termination of a bronchiole and or a pulmonary arteriole.

At this level fresh nuclei begin to appear, and form the substance of the olivary body (Figs. 247, 249 o), and the beginning of the grey matter of the cerebellum, corpora quadrigemina (Fig. 248 h), optic thalamus (Fig. 245 th), subthalamic body (cs), and n.c. liar, p Pig. 249.

All these nuclei give rise in their turn to fresh bundles of fibres, some of which run in distinct tracts while others interlace with their neighbours. Presently the longitudinal fibres are crossed by numerous arciform fibres (Fig. 249) some external (fae), others lying deeper (Fr, b) and forming a network (formatio reticularis) with the longitudinal fibres.

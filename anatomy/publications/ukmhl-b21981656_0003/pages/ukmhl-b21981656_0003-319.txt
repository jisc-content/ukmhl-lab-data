INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS. 303 ART. 659.] Cf, CD Fig. 277. Sclerosis and shrinking of the entire grey matter. (Section taken from lower dorsal region of a man of 30 suffering from acute anterior poliomyelitis: preparation treated as in last figure: x 6) a site of grey matter 6 sclerosis of posterior columns. In the first place the cord is subject to acute inflammation affecting chiefly the grey matter, and described as central myelitis or poliomyelitis (ttoXlos grey). Anterior poliomyelitis is the commonest form (Figs. 275, 276), the inflammation being limited to one or both anterior horns. More rarely it extends to the posterior horns or to the entire section of the grey columns (Fig. 277). The disease chiefly attacks children less than four years old, and hence the clinical name of infantile spinal paralysis; it is rare in adults. Its onset is acute, there is usually fever, and soon paralysis, which in the course of a week passes away to some extent. So far as our knowledge goes the inflammation is haemo- rrhagic in character, and gives rise to functional disorder partly by destruction of tissue and partly by pressure. The preference shown for the anterior columns and especially for the inner two- thirds of each appears to be due to the fact that these parts constitute a special vascular territory distinct from the white matter. The length of the affected region varies from about 0'5 to 4 centimetres, though cases occur in which much larger segments of the cord are attacked. The number of ganglion-cells and nerve-fibres destroyed depends on the severity of the inflammation: sometimes indeed the whole of the nerve-tissue perishes outright. In the course of weeks or months the exudation and the products of disintegration are absorbed. If the neuroglia as well as the nerve-elements is destroyed a small cyst is formed. If the neuroglia persists and undergoes a moderate hyperplasia, the substance of the anterior horn is transformed into a grey gelatinous

XCI. fissure is the frontal lobe, and includes the ascending-frontal (A), the superior-frontal (C,), middle-frontal (02), and inferior-frontal (G'a) convolutions. The last three convolutions all pass round to the orbital surface of the hemisphere. Fig. 243.

These (BDEF) constitute the parietal lobe. The parieto-occipital furrow (c) and the anterior-occipital furrow (i) separate the parietal from the occipital lobe ((?), and in the space between the two furrows the so-called annectant (or connect- ing) convolutions pass over from the parietal lobe to the occipital lobe. The sylvian fissure (e) forms the boundary between the outer and lower portions of the frontal and parietal regions and the tem- poral lobe. The convolution bordering the lower side of the fissure is the first-temporal or superior temporo-sphenoidal (HJ.

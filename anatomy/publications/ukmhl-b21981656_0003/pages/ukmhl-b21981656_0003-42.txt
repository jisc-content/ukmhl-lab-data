26 THE URINARY ORGANS. [CHAP. LXVI. existence of a haemorrhagic stage); Mogling, Zur Entstehung d. haemorrhagi- schen Infarcts Jeua 1884 (with an admirable summary of the literature). Litten has shown experimentally that the renal epithelium dies if deprived of blood for two hours. If the deprivation is of shorter duration it becomes for a time incapable of performing its functions. When the anaemia ie maintained for six to eight hours the connective-tissue elements like- wise perish. In rabbits and dogs the epithelium when killed by temporary ligature of the renal artery is in part detached from the tubules and forms epithelial casts which ultimately become calcified. The urine secreted by a kidney in this state of anaemic degeneration and necrosis is found to contain albumen. Litten holds that the albumen is derived from the degenerate epithelium, inasmuch as the glomeruli are apparently unaltered. This theory cannot be confuted, but it does not seem necessary, seeing that the admitted degeneration of the glomerular epithelium suffices to explain the escape of albuminous liquid from the capillaries.

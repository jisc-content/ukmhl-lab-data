The pyramidal lateral columns cross each other at the decussation (Fig. 247 DPy), and pass to the ventral surface of the medulla (Fig. 249^), while the shorter tracts connecting the several portions of the grey matter become less and less superficial. The column of Goll and the column of Burdach pass up (as the funiculus gracilis (Fig. 248 a) and funiculus cuneatus (6) respectively) to the lateral margin of the fourth ventricle, and together with lateral cerebellar tract and the arciform fibres of the restiform body (c) form the posterior peduncle of the cerebellum (e).

37 ART. 535.] RENAL DEGENERATION AND NECROSIS. Sometimes they coalesce to a frothy-looking mass. The nuclei of the cells sooner or later disappear (Fig. 206 c d), often before the form of the cells themselves is lost. This loss of the nucleus is due either to a process of swelling up and solution, or to disintegration into fragments. The necrosed cells either break up in situ, or are first detached and then dissolve or disintegrate (Art. 533). Some- times oil-globules may be seen in the necrosed epithelium. When a portion of the tubular epithelium undergoes necrosis, similar changes are usually to be made out here and there in the glomerular epithelium also. Sometimes the changes are very marked. The cells swell up, are cast off (Fig. 207 e1 e3), lose their nuclei (e), and occasionally become vacuolated (e2). Treatment of Fio. 207.

Ultimately the cells dissolve entirely, or with the exudation from the glome- rular vessels form a granular coagulum (g). The denuded capillaries look pale and devoid of nuclei (d); they swell up and appear somewhat thickened. When the necrosis is total all the nuclei disappear. The capsular epithelium undergoes necrosis much less frequently than that of the glomerulus, but cases occur in which it entirely perishes. Necrosis of the renal epithelium appears as a primary affection

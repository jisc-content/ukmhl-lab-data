155 FORMS OF PNEUMONIA. ART. 606.] yellow, the surfaco has a typically marbled appearance. The exciting virus is probably a micrococcus. The septic (suppurative and gangrenous) inflammations of the lung which occur in new-born infants are in general bronchopneumonias due to aspiration of decomposing genital secretions or liquor amnii; sometimes they are due to embolic infection from the unhealed stump of the umbilical cord. The pleura and interlobular septa are usually much inflamed at the same time. Keferences:—P. Muller, Gerkardt's Handbuch d. Kinderkr. n; Orth, Arch. d. Heilk. xni; Runge, Zeitschr. f.

The commonest and best-known is miliary tuberculosis, the rarer is the embolic localised form. Miliary tuberculosis of the lung is set up when tubercle- bacilli enter the circulation in considerable numbers, and lodge in the pulmonary capillaries. As they settle and multiply they give rise to the formation of miliary nodules or tubercles, which are numerous or scanty according to the number of bacilli introduced. Usually they are distributed pretty uniformly through the paren- ch}'ina of the lung and the pleura, though sometimes they are concentrated more closely in one part. The formation of the tubercles begins with a localised cellular infiltration in the alveolar septa (Fig. 231) or other element of the pulmonary tissue where the bacilli have found a nidus. Fig. 231.

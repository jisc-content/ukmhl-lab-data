[CHAP. LXVI. THE URINARY ORGANS. 20 affection which is best described by the term arteriosclerotic atrophy. The renal arteries and their branches in aged persons are very frequently the seat of sclerotic change (Art. 297), which may simultaneously affect the arteries of other regions also, or be confined to those of the kidney. The intima of the vessels thus becomes notably thickened (Fig. 203 a, Fig. 204 e f) and the lumen narrowed or obliterated: the result is that a certain number of glomeruli become more or less functionless, the number depend- ing on the size of the affected arterial stem.

The cortex is the terminal station for all nerves. Every part of the sensorial surface of the body and the whole muscular system are connected by nerve-tracts (the 'projective system') with the cortex. By means of these tracts impressions corresponding to every sensory stimulus and to every muscular movement are conveyed to the cortex; and these impressions probably leave traces or 'memories' in the ultimate structure of the grey matter

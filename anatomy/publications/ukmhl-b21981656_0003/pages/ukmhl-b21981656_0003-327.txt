Cerebrospinal syphilis usually makes its appearance some years after the disease has become 'constitutional', that is to say, simultaneously with the so-called tertiary symptoms: it is rarely an accompaniment of the secondary symptoms. The charac- teristic morbid change is the formation of circumscribed inflamma- tory foci, or gummata as they are called, in the meninges and cortex, very rarely in the interior of the brain or cord. As a rule they lie in the pia mater and subarachnoid tissue of the base of the brain. The first thing observed in the meninges is a small patch of inflammation, which soon leads to the formation of a grey or greyish-red semi-translucent or gelatinous knot of granulation- tissue (Fig. 280). In the earlier stages the tissue of the knot is ^^m^m^&m^: ;Â»&r % - & / e I Fig. 280. Gummatous syphilitic meningoencephalitis.

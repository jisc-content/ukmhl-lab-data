CHAPTER XCI. STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS. 624. The central nervous system consists of the spinal cord, the cerebral axis, and the cerebrum. These parts are made up of nerve-cells and nerve-fibres, together with a framework of con- nective tissue which carries the nutrient vessels. The nerve-cells or ganglion-cells are for the most part aggregated in masses which are known as nerve-centres or grey nuclei. The nerve-fibres form either plexuses or tracts, and serve to connect the ganglion-cells of one group with those of another or with the peripheral termina- tions (end-organs) of certain nerves. The cord and the cerebral axis contain centres of subordinate importance, forming as it were intermediate stations between the central and peripheral extremities of the nerve-tracts. The cerebrum is the central terminus with which the peripheral sensory and motor end-organs are connected either directly or through the intermediate stations. The cerebrum consists of two hemispheres connected by a commissure, the corpus callosum. The outer surface of the hemispheres is thrown into a series of complicated convolutions consisting of ridges and furrows (gyri and sulci), the latter ramifying and intercommunicating in a remarkable way. Some of the sulci are characteristic of the human brain, and are always present; others vary in different brains, and thus the configuration of the convolutions is by no means absolutely constant. The most important sulci areâ€”the sylvian fissure (Fig. 243 e), the central or rolandian fissure (a), the praecentral or transverse- frontal furrow (b), the intraparietal furrow (d), the first-temporal or parallel furrow (/), the parieto-occipital furrow (c), the anterior-occipital furrow (i), and the inferior-occipital furrow The central fissure divides the cerebral hemisphere into an ante- rior and a posterior portion; the (central) convolutions which form its anterior and posterior borders are known as the anterior-central or ascending-frontal (A), and the posterior-central or ascending- parietal (B). The portion of the hemisphere in front of the central

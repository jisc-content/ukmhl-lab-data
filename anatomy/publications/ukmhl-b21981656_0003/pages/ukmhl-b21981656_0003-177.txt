CHAPTER LXXXVII. FORMS OF BRONCHOPNEUMONIA. 610. Non-specific bronchopneumonia. All forms of bronchopneumonia are at first essentially local disorders, whose extent and distribution are determined by the position and relations of the affected bronchioles and alveolar ducts. This local character is most apparent when the irritant substance which induces the bronchopneumonia inflammation is in a minutely divided form and suspended in the inspired air, so that it reaches the terminal air- Fia. 233.

In animals such inflammations can readily be produced by causing them to breathe an atmosphere containing irritant substances in the form of dust or spray. In man the earlier Fio. 233. Fig. 234. S.

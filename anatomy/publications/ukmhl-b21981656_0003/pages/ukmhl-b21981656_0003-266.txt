THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. [CHAP. XCIV. 250 either liquid or the detritus of the nerve-fibres together with granule-cells (d) and a few leucocytes. The neuroglia of the grey matter, like that of the white, may persist after the nerve-elements have disappeared. The tissue in hardened sections appears granular (Fig. 258) and beset with the Fig. 254. Section through the margin of a patch of softening in the bbain.

In the cortex of the brain fibrils make their appearance which at their intersections exhibit small masses of protoplasm with or without nuclei. Here and there cells can be seen giving off processes resembling the fibrils. As degeneration proceeds a delicate granular meshwork (Fig. 260 a Art. 642, Fig. 271 Art. 650), with cells placed at some of the intersections, is all that remains. Ultimately this too disappears, so that nothing persists but the blood-vessels (Fig. 260 b, Fig. 254 cc,). In many cases the persisting neuroglia itself ultimately perishes. In others it remains quiescent or undergoes hyperplasia. So far as can be made out the process begins by subdivision and multi- plication of the persisting nuclei of the tissue-cells (Fig. 253/, Fig. 254 B). This is followed by cell-multiplication and fibrillation, and the.resulting new tissue appears like a felted mass of delicate

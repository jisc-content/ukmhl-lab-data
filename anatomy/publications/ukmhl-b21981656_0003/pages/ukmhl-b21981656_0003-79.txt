63 ART. 547.] HAEMATOGENOUS NEPHRITIS. The tunica adventitia of the blood-vessels (n o) is usually more or less thickened. Sometimes the thickening extends to the inner coats also, and leads to obstruction of the vessel. A certain cl e a Fig. 214. Inflammatory induration and ateophy of the renal tissue.

The glomerular epithelium in recent cases is seen to be swollen or loosened and desquamated (/), though this change is seldom so marked as in the forms of nephritis already described: it is also rare for the capsular epithelial cells to show signs of any great degree of multiplication or of desquamation. When there is much thickening of the capsule, or much disturbance of the circulation through obstruction of the capillaries or narrowing of the vasa afforentia, the glomeruli begin to atrophy. The capillary

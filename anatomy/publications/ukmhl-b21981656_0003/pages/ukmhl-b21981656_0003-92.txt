[CHAP. LXXII. 76 THE URINARY ORGANS. tubules and is lined with epithelium like theirs. It is very probable that these growths may develope into carcinomata. Cancers of the kidney are either soft or hard, and lead to greater or less enlargement of the organ; sometimes the enlarge- ment is very great. In the larger tumours the whole of the renal epithelium may be destroyed by the cancerous growth. The latter may extend into the pelvis. The smaller tumours affect only a portion of the parenchyma and are often fairly well marked off from the sound tissue. The tumours commonly enclose softened and haemorrhagic patches, whence blood and cancerous detritus may reach the urine. Renal carcinoma occurs at all ages, but is relatively frequent in children. In general it is unilateral, though cases are recorded in which a smaller tumour has been found in the second kidney. Sarcoma and carcinoma are not infrequent as secondary or metastatic growths: they form rounded nodes. References on myosarcoma :—Eberth, Virch.

Of the animal parasites inhabiting the kidney Echino- coccus is the most important. It forms hydatid cysts from the size of a hazel-nut to that of a child's head, with or without daughter- cysts. The cysts may burst into the pelvis of the kidney. When the scolices die the cyst may contract, and its contents become inspissated and cretaceous. Gysticercus cellulosae and Pentastoma denticulatum are very rare. When the blood contains Filaria a number of the parasites reach the kidney, lying both without and within the vessels. Their presence in the kidney and in the thoracic duct gives rise to intermittent haematuria and chyluria, the urine in the latter case being milky from the admixture of excessively fine oil-globules (Art. 235). Eustrongylus gigas and Bilharzia or Distoma haematobium have already been alluded to (Art. 553). The eggs of the latter when deposited in the mucous membrane of the pelvis or ureter

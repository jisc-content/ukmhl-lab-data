vi PREFACE. pathology. After consultation with several teachers of experience I have decided to adhere to the plan indicated in the second volume, and to leave these additional sections alone, at least for the present. They are not wholly Professor Ziegler's, and their subject-matter is perhaps more likely to be studied profitably in special text-books. To the acknowledgements already made I have to add my sincere thanks to Dr James Ross, who has read for me the pages on the Nervous System. His general approval of them gives me reason to hope that in this difficult part of the work I have not fallen into any serious error. DONALD MAC ALISTER St John's College, Cambridge, October 1886.

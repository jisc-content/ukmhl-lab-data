261 ART. 642.] SIMPLE AND DEGENERATIVE ATROPHY. The arteries of the brain and cord have no arterial anastomoses within the nerve-substance, and thus after the closure of one of them collateral circulation is very slowly and imperfectly established. This is especially the case when the neighbouring arteries are already rigid and obstructed by atheromatous or hyaline change in their walls. Engorgement, stasis, and haemorrhage all lead to local anaemia or ischaemia of the particular regions affected. Haemorrhage need not be at all large; even the smallest extravasations, confined it may be to the pial sheaths of the vessels, have their effect, c I Fig. 260.

CHAPTER LXV. CLASSIFICATION OF RENAL DISORDERS. 520. Structure of the kidney. The kidney is a compound tubular gland by which water, certain salts, and nitrogenous waste- products are separated from the blood and excreted. Abnormal substances which have gained access to the blood are likewise in great measure removed from the body by this channel. The peculiar structure of the kidney corresponds with its function of separating these substances from the blood which circulates through it. On section the kidney is seen to consist of two well-marked zones, the cortex without, the medulla within. The cortex forms a stratum from 8 to 10 mm. in thickness, enclosing the medulla which has the form of a number of rounded cones projecting inwardly, the free apices being known as papillae. These medullary cones or malpighian pyramids are made up chiefly of tubules and blood-vessels, whose general course is from the base to the apex. The number of tubules increases as we approach the base of a pyramid, partly because they subdivide, partly from the presence of tubules passing for a short distance into the pyramid from the cortex and then doubling back towards the cortex again. The latter tubules are slender and narrow, especially in the recurrent part; they are described as Henle's loops. The branching tubules are considerably wider and are known as the collecting tubes. The blood-vessels and the tubules are bound together by a small quantity of connective tissue containing lymphatic vessels. The cortex is in the main made up of two distinct structural elements. The simpler structures are the so-called medullary- rays. These are slightly conical portions passing up from the medulla and ceasing to be distinguishable only at the outer border of the cortex (Fig. 201 B): they are simply prolongations of the medullary substance and consist of like bundles of straight tubules (k). The vessels (e) of these rays are arranged in much the same manner as those of the medulla.

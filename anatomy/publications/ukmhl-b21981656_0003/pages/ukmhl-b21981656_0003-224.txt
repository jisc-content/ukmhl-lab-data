THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. [CHAP. XCI. 208 626. The spinal cord is an elongated cylindrical body, some- what flattened antero-posteriorly, and composed of grey matter and white matter. The grey matter is in the interior, extending throughout the length of the cord, the cross-section being roughly H-shaped (Fig. 246) and forming two anterior horns (or cornua, ca) and two posterior horns (op), united by a grey commissure. The commissure contains the central canal (cc), a slender tube lined with epithelium. The anterior horns are of larger sectional area than the posterior, but their size and configuration vary remarkably in different parts of the cord: they are smallest in the dorsal region.

They interlace and form a network enclosing portions of white substance in its meshes. In the cervical and upper dorsal regions a lateral projection of the anterior horn appears, and is called the intermedio-lateral tract or lateral horn (c I). The grey substance contains a multitude of ganglion-cells and nerve-fibres of various thicknesses, enclosed in a delicate neuroglia. .Round the central canal and at the extremity of the posterior

The tissue thus infiltrated sooner or later becomes caseous and breaks down, induration seldom occurring to any appreciable extent. At first the inflamed lobules appear on section airless, greyish- red, smooth, gelatinous, and infiltrated: the condition has been well described as gelatinous infiltration. They afterwards become paler, then grey and translucent, and lastly opaque yellowish - white. The number of the lobules so affected is of course variable. When they are numerous we usually find at the time of death that different lobules are in different stages of the process, some being greyish-red, others grey, others yellowish-white. Frequently the latter show signs of softening and excavation, or there are actually cavities of considerable size and communicating with the air by way of the bronchi. When all the lobules of a lobe are thus affected, the disease assumes the appearance of a lobar affection and is often so described (Art. 606). Microscopical examination however always proves

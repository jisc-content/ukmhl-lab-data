319 ART. 663.] TUMOURS AND PARASITES. calcification may set in, and alter the vessels or lead to an increase of the so-called brain-sand. Calcareous plates are often formed in the otherwise unaltered pia mater; and in the ventricular plexuses the brain-sand may be so increased that the plexuses are visibly enlarged and turn an opaque white. In tumours the like occurs, in combination with calcareous degeneration of the vessels. When the accumulation of calcareous matter in the growth is very great we have what is called psammoma. The organic basis of brain-sand consists of flattened cells which cohere like the coats of an onion, become homogeneous and lose their nuclei, and then are calcified. Carcinomata are found in the ventricles, and form soft tumours (Fig. 282 a), usually connected with the plexuses and originating in their epithelium or (more rarely) in that of the ependyma. The cancer-cells (Fig 283 a) lying in a fibrous stroma are of the cylindrical or columnar type. By the outgrowth of the vascular stroma into papillae the tumour sometimes assumes a papillomatous appearance (Fig. 283). If as not infrequently happens the stroma undergoes partial mucoid degeneration (Fig. 283 b c c,) the tumour exhibits a very peculiar structure. The papillary outgrowths are transformed into Fig. 282. Papillomatous carcinoma of the choroid plexus.

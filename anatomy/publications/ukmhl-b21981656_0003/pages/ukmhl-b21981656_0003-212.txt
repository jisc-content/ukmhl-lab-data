THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. [CHAP. LXXXIX. 196 goitre in goitrous regions indicate that at certain times the conditions favouring infection are exceptionally intense, and cause either an unusual development of the miasma or a temporarily increased predisposition on the part of the persons affected. In places where goitre is endemic, deaf-mutes, idiots, and so-called cretins are exceptionally numerous. Cretinism is a disorder of development essentially affecting the growth of the bones, but accompanied also by morbid changes in the soft parts. These forms of imperfect development have often been correlated with the occurrence of goitre; and it has been suggested that cretinism may be due to the miasma which induces goitre, the latter being as it were a milder form of the same disorder. Bircher formally states his belief that endemic goitre, endemic deaf-mutism, cretinism, and cretinoid idiocy are all due to one and the same miasma. Further research is required before this view can be either accepted or rejected. It has in its favour the fact that cretins and cretinoid idiots are usually also goitrous, and that they are more numerous in regions where goitre is endemic. Horsley {Brown Lectures, Brit. Med. Journ. 1, 1885) has shown experimental evidence for the view that cretinism, as also the peculiar cachexia which occasionally follows the extirpation of a goitre {cachexia strumipriva), and myxoedema are consequences of arrest of the function of the thyroid gland. By removing the gland he succeeded in producing in monkeys a cretinoid state, characterised by hebetude, malnutrition, muscular tremor, puny- oedema, leucocytosis, and the presence of mucin in the blood and connective tissues. Myxoedema in the human subject is a state having the same general characters, and it is associated with wasting of the thyroid gland or its destruction by a new growth.

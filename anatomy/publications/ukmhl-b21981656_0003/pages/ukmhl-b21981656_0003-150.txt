THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. [CHAP. LXXXIII. 134 When there is much atrophy of the parenchyma the distended lung feels remarkably soft and downy, and its edges are markedly translucent. If the air is pressed out the lung becomes a mere flaccid inelastic mass with membranous edges. Chronic idiopathic emphysema is occasionally limited to a part of the lung, usually to the edges. In this case the expiratory obstruction has obviously been also local. When some of the vesicles in the general or in the local form are of exceptional size we have what is called bullous emphy- sema. The air is usually not easily pressed out of the larger vesicles. The above account refers the production of emphysema chiefly to mechanical causes, namely to abnormal distension of the alveolar walls ; but the atrophy of the latter may be much accelerated by malnutrition or senile decay of the pulmonary tissue In senile emphysema the latter factor is of essential importance, though the mechanical factors must not be entirely overlooked. In emphysema a large number of capillaries are obliterated, and the vascular area of the pulmonary artery being thus contracted the resistance to the circulation through it is increased. Compensatory hypertrophy of the right ventricle is thus a frequent concomitant, while the pulmonary arterioles that remain are often visibly dilated. Eeferences :â€”Jenner, Med. chir.

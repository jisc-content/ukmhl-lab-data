Acute diffuse nephritis with sero-fibrinous exudation, or as we may call it acute inflammatory oedema of the kidney, gives rise to more or less swelling of the organ, in some cases so extreme that it attains a length of 22 to 25 centimetres. The capsule is easily stripped off, the surface smooth, the tint grey or greyish-red speckled with yellowish-red. On section the cortex and medulla appear swollen and sodden, usually pale-grey or greyish-yellow, and occasionally streaked or speckled with red. The whole organ is soft, especially so when the swelling is great. The swelling is due mainly to the accumulation of liquid in the intertubular connective tissue of the cortex (Fig. 210), and to some extent of the medulla. The stroma is greatly thickened and contains a liquid which in recent preparations, more commonly however in hardened ones, is mingled with threads and granules of fibrin (a). The vessels may be compressed by the liquid, but sometimes at least in places appear distended with blood (b). Fig. 210. Diffuse nephritis with sero-fibrinous exudation.

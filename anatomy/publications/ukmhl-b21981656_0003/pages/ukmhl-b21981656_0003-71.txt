The latter is however not a common result of the affection now considered; it occurs much more frequently as a sequel of pyelonephritis (Art. 554). Wide-spread suppuration of the renal tissue gives rise to catarrhal, purulent, or even diphtheritic inflammation of the pelvis of the kidney: and not infrequently abscesses are formed in the surrounding subperitoneal tissue (perinephritic abscess). Suppurative nephritis (not clue to pyelonephritis) occurs most frequently in connexion with ulcerative endocarditis and with traumatic pyaemia. It may however be associated with a great variety of diseases, such for instance as dysentery, ulcerative phthisis, and actinomycosis (Israel, Virch. Arch. vol. 74). The abscesses are usually punctiform or miliary; large abscesses are rare. Suppurative nephritis is not infrequently combined with embolic obstruc- tion of the renal arteries, leading to the formation of infarcts. According to Litten (Zeitschr. f. klin. Med. iv) there are some forms of acute nephritis in which large numbers of micrococci are diffused throughout

Croupous pneumonia is an inflammation of one or more lobes of the lung, and is the characteristic symptom of a certain specific infective disease. The disease is acute, and the anatomical change which accompanies it is the appearance of a firm or solid exudation within the pulmonary alveoli. The exudation may be limited to a portion of one lobe or appear in several isolated patches; but more usually it extends over the greater part or the whole of one lobe, or over the entire lung. Occasionally indeed both lungs are affected. The exudation either reaches its full extent suddenly and rapidly, or advances by successive stages. The process begins with intense congestive hyperaemia, by reason of which the lung appears of a deep red colour. This is the stage of congestion (engouement). The hyperaemia is accom- panied by exudation from the vessels, by which in a short time the air is driven out of the alveoli, alveolar ducts, and respi- ratory bronchioles. At the same time the protoplasmic epithelial cells, and the homogeneous plates lining these spaces, are at least in part detached or shed (Fig. 224, Art. 596). The alveolar contents thus consist (Fig. 226, Art. 597) of albuminous liquid, red and white blood-cells, and desquamated 0F THE LltJNG- pulmonary epithelium.

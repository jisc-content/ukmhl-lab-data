ART. 665.] DURA MATER, PINEAL BODY, PITUITARY BODY. 327 of the neighbouring parts: tubercles and gummata are however rare in this situation (Weigert). The pineal body consists of fibrous tissue enclosing a number of more or less spherical follicles, each containing a reticulate structure of epithelial cells, a number of rounded cells with slender processes (Toldt), and a quantity of brain-sand. The most frequent pathological changes observed in this organ are—abnormal increase of the quantity of brain-sand (psammoma), hyperplastic enlargement (so-called glioma), and cystic degenera- tion (hydrops cysticus); it may participate in inflammations of the adjacent structures. The author once found in it a tumour as large as a pigeon's egg, consisting essentially of blood-clot (haematoma).

244 THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. [CHAP. XCTII. in the grey commissure and the posterior horns. The appearances would thus be accounted for. Leyden regards syringomyelia as resulting from congenital hydromyelia in the manner described in the text. Westphal takes a like view, which is rendered at least possible by the fact that the central canal even in a foetus of the fifth month still extends to the posterior margin of the cord. Ziegler agrees with those who think the affection is essentially due to an excavation of proliferous neuroglia. Langhans is no doubt right in stating that tumours of the cord and medulla give rise to very remarkable dilatations of the central canal, and it is not hard to believe that actual diverticula are occasionally produced. But these should properly be considered as cases of hydromyelia, and they do not exclude the possibility of an excavation of pro- liferous tissue ; to this latter it would perhaps be well to limit the term syrin- gomyelia. Probably too we shall be right in referring the whole process to a congenital anomaly of development, the proliferation depending on some morbid structure of the neuroglia, accompanying or following upon defective closure of the canal or defective elaboration of the grey or white matter in its neighbourhood.

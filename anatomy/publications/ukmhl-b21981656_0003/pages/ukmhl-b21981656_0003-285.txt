ART. 646.] SIMPLE AND DEGENERATIVE ATROPHY. 269 cerebellar tracts (Fig. 246 Ksb) above the lesion become degene- rate: they pass from the vesicular columns (of Clarke) to the cerebellum. According to Schultze a small region of the lateral column near the periphery also undergoes atrophy. Secondary degeneration occurs chiefly after ischaemic softening, atrophy from compression, and haemorrhagic or inflammatory destruction of the tracts and centres indicated. It does not always follow upon sclerosis of the cord or brain, inasmuch as the conducting tracts are apparently not always entirely interrupted in passing through sclerotic patches. The degeneration takes place simultaneously over the whole extent of the affected tract. It is recognisable under the micro- scope in the second week after the initial lesion, disintegration of the medullary sheath and axis-cylinder of the nerve-fibres having by that time begun. When it has advanced to a certain point absorption of the products of disintegration begins, and the familiar granule-cells make their appearance. The space vacated by the atrophied fibres is filled up partly by effusion of liquid, partly by hyperplasia of the neuroglia, though it may be months or years before the latter becomes fairly dense and compact (Art. 639, Figs. 255, 256). So long as the degenerate tracts contain abundance of detritus they are white, opaque, and soft. As absorption goes on they become grey and translucent; when sclerosis takes place they become firm, and at the same time shrink in volume. In the text we have spoken only of total secondary degeneration of the longitudinal tracts of the brain and cord. Of course particular bundles of fibres may likewise undergo degeneration, and even the short transverse or commissural fibres of the cord. Schultze met with a case of traumatic injury to the sciatic fibres in the lumbar cord, in which only the posterior portions of the columns of Goll were atrophied. Nerve-tracts degenerate from the initial lesion up to the next terminal organ, and apparently in the direction of normal conduction. Some of the fibres of the cord however do not degenerate in either direction after an interrupting lesion (Flechsig). Bouchard and Schiefferdecker found secondary degeneration 14 days after lesion, W. Muller 13 days, and Kahler and Pick 11 days. Eeferences:—Turck, Zeitschr. d. Gesell. d.

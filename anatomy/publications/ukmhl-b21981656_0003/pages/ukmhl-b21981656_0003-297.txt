ART. 650.] SIMPLE AND DEGENERATIVE ATROPHY. 281 softening. If the destruction is extensive a permanent defect or hiatus will remain: if it is more limited after the disintegration and absorption of the nerve-elements there is left a tissue consisting of neuroglia (Fig. 271 B) and a network of vessels (d). This is partly old and persisting tissue, partly new-formed; its essential components are stellate or multipolar cells (b) whose processes freely anastomose. After absorption is complete a clear liquid containing a few leucocytes (c) lies in the meshes of the tissue. The result is a grey moist gelatinous patch, an example of what is called grey gelatinous degeneration. Fig. 271. Grey gelatinous degeneration of the anterior horn. {From the lumbar cord, 18 months after an attack of acute poliomyelitis: prepared with Miiller's fluid, haematoxylin and carmine, and Canada balsam: x200) A white matter B apex of the anterior horn a atrophied anterior roots e sclerosis of white matter contigu- b branching neuroglia-cells forming ous to a network of fine glistening fibres / dense sclerosis of the margin of the c round cells without processes anterior horn d blood-vessel Such gelatinous patches are usually surrounded by a zone in which the network of neurogliar fibres is much denser (ef), and might almost be called a feltwork, and the nerve-elements of the contiguous tissue are as it were embedded in the dense overgrowth which surrounds them (e). This change which in gelatinous patches is only marginal becomes in other cases general. Dense hyperplasia of the neuroglia may take place throughout the whole extent of a degenerating patch, and give rise to what is called hard sclerosis, or simply sclerosis (taken in a restricted sense). Sclerotic patches such as we have described occur chiefly as

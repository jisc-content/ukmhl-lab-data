AET. 597.] PULMONARY INFLAMMATIONS IN GENERAL. 139 later stage. In these the cells break up and dissolve entirely, forming with the exuded liquid a granular and fibrinous mass (d): Fig. 227. Caseating lobular bronchopneumonia. (Section hardened in alcohol and stained with haematoxylin: x 120) a alveolar septa infiltrated with cells b venule with infiltrated wall c alveoli filled with large epithelioid cells d alveolar contents consisting of gra- nular and fibrinous coagula when recent this- contains a few nuclei, but soon these too disappear and the mass becomes uniformly fibrinous. The two forms of coagu- lation are met with in combination. The coagulated exudation is more or less solid, and the affected parenchyma accordingly becomes firm and resistent, resembling liver in consistence: the condition is therefore described as hepatisation of the lung. The surface on section is usually rough and granulated, the coagula projecting somewhat from the cut alveolar walls. The colour varies from deep-red (red hepatisa- tion) to greyish-red or greyish-yellow (grey hepatisation), according to the amount of blood that is present and the composition of the exudation. In many forms of pulmonary inflammation the changes within the contents of the alveoli are those that are most striking and important, the changes in the parenchyma itself being of secondary significance. These forms have been described as superficial in contradistinction to interstitial inflammations; in the latter marked changes (infiltration, hyperplasia, etc.) are simultaneously set up in the connective tissues (Fig. 227 a b). The distinction can frequently be made, but it is not exactly one of kind, as the two forms pass the one into the other through a number of transitional stages.

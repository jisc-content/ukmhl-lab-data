305 INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS. ART. 659.] When myelitis attacks the region of the bulbar nuclei it gives rise to acute glosso-labio-pharyngeal or bulbar paralysis. Under conditions analogous to those which lead to acute poliomyelitis in children we may apparently have an acute inflammation of the cortical grey matter or acute polioencephal- itis (Strumpell), the result of which is infantile cerebral paralysis. In its later stages it is characterised by loss of substance in the convolutions, resembling the congenital condition known as porencephalia (Art. 630). Benedikt (Virch. Arch. vol. 64), Kolessnikow (ibid. vol. 85), Forel (Zeitschr. f. Thiermed. in), Allbutt (Trans. Path. Soc. xxm 1872), Gowers (ibid, xxviii 1878), Ross (ibid, xxx 1880), Coats (Med. chir. Trans, lxi 1878), and Weller (Arch. f. Psych. 1879) all agree in stating that in hydrophobia circumvascular extravasations, some of them haemorrhagic, are found in the central nervous organs. Benedikt, Kolessnikow, Gowers, and Weller also discovered circumvascular hyaline and granular coagulated masses formed from the extravasated elements of the blood, together with venous thromboses (Benedikt), and patches of ' granular' degeneration. Forel was not able to verify these observations. Langhans (Virch. Arch. vol. 64) found in the cord in cases of tetany certain circumvascular patches of cellular infiltration. Nauwerck in a recent case of chorea minor with endocarditis observed small patches of inflammation situated chiefly in the medulla; these were combined with certain degenerative changes in the brain and cord. Myelitis is said to occur among the Kabyles in North Africa as a result of eating the pulse of Lathyrus cicera: see Art. 648, and Marie (Progres medical 1883), Proust (Bulletin de Vacad. d. me'd. xii 1884). The number of white blood-cells usually present in the brain (Duke Karl Theodor of Bavaria, Virch. Arch. vol. 69) is increased in typhoid (Popofp), but not necessarily owing to inflammation. Sometimes, though rarely, dis- seminated encephalitis is associated with typhoid. Steudener (Beitr. z. path. Anat. d. Lepra mutilans 1865), Neumann (Skin diseases, trans, by Pullar, London 1871), Tschirjew (Arch, de physiol. 1879), and Langhans (Virch. Arch. vol. 64) found inflammatory foci in the cord in connexion with anaesthetic leprosy. See also Sturge, Brain vn 1885. Erb and others affirm that in infantile spinal paralysis the inflammatory disturbance extends over the whole of the anterior columns, reaching its greatest intensity only at certain parts, and the wide-spread initial paralysis corresponds with this view of the case. After weeks or months however only circumscribed changes can be demonstrated, the extent of which varies with the extent of the persistent paralysis. When certain muscles only are paralysed, certain spots only of the anterior horns are found to be degenerate.

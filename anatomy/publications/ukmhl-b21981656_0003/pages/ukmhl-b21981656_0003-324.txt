THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. [OHAP. XCVI. 308 flattened and the subarachnoid liquid expressed, leaving the arachnoid surface dry. The completely-developed tubercles in the nerve-tissue appear as little nodules, grey and translucent, or yellowish-white with a grey periphery. Quite recent continuous patches of tuberculous infiltration have a reddish tint, like other inflamed parts. wife \ I w Fig. 279. Chronic disseminated tuberculous meningoencephalitis.

If growing near a vein they are seen to penetrate not only the adventitia but the inner coats, until the lumen of the vessel appears closely beset and encircled with the accumulated cells. The white blood-cells inside the vessel are often arranged peripherally, and sometimes visibly distend it.

Stenosis and occlusion of the bronchi are generally the result of inflammation. When the bronchial wall is infiltrated and the mucous membrane covered with exudations and secretions, the air-passage is always to a certain extent obstructed, and some of the smaller bronchi are frequently blocked up entirely. As a rule this obstruction passes away, the morbid accumulations (mucus, pus, croupous exudations, etc.) being removed by absorption and expectoration, while the swelling of the bronchial wall gradually goes down. Sometimes however the secretions are only imperfectly removed, and the obstruction persists for a considerable time. This is most frequently the case in the apices of the lungs, where the respiratory movements are less marked than in other parts. Secretions which are rich in cells or which become inspissated and viscid are apt to cause chronic obstruction. Chronic thickening of the bronchial wall, whether from cellular infiltration or fibrous hyperplasia, has much the same effect. Persistent obstruction of the bronchi may result from simple acute or chronic inflammation, but it is far more commonly due to tuber- culous inflammation. This is owing to the fact that in tuberculosis FlO. 217. TWO OCCLUDED BRONCHIOLES FROM A TUBERCULOUS LUNO.

8 THE URINARY ORGANS. [CHAP. LXIV. Absence of the bladder unaccompanied by any other grave malformation is seldom observed; but it is more frequently found to be abnormally small. When the bladder is absent the ureters open into the urethra. Absence of the urethra occurs in both sexes: in females the bladder may open directly into the vagina. Atresia of the urethra also occurs in both sexes, and is due either to defect of some part of the canal or to obliteration of its orifice. The canal may be abnormally narrow either throughout or at some particular part (congenital stricture). The contraction is in some cases due to hypertrophy of the colliculus seminalis. When the urethra opens on the upper aspect of the penis the condition is called epispadias, when it opens on the under aspect hypospadias. The latter is the more common: the orifice may be either in the penile portion, or in the anterior and even in the posterior attachment of the scrotum {hypospadias perineoscrotalis). The penis is usually small and stunted. Occasionally we meet with cases in which the urethra has more than one external orifice: and in males the glans penis is sometimes pierced with what appears to be a second meatus, but is in reality a short passage ending caecally.

ART. 658.] INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS. 299 Cicatrisation and Sclerosis. 658. Repair of wounds of the brain and cord. Bruises, cuts, stabs, and gun-shot wounds of the brain are usually fatal from the supervention of purulent meningitis and encephalitis. More rarely abscesses are formed which are evacuated and healed up by granulation and cicatrisation. It is only when the wound is aseptic or is at once protected from septic infection that we can expect healing without suppuration. The destructive changes set up by a traumatic lesion vary with its nature. Bruises and contusions are the most dangerous, stabs and punctures the least so. When the brain is punctured (Fig. 274 a), as by a dagger-wound, in the first place haemorrhage takes place, and the tissue imme- diately contiguous is thereby destroyed. A patch of anaemic or haemorrhagic necrotic softening (b) is thus produced, the meninges overlying the part being usually infiltrated with blood. Fig. 274.

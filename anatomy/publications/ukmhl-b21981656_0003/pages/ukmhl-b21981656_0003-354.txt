338 [CHAP. CI. PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. The regeneration of the nerve-fibres begins a few days after the operation (Ranvier) in the central end: Ranvier says at the very extremity of this end, Vanlair at a distance of 15 to 2 cm. from it. Eichhorst observed the beginning of regeneration in the nerve of a rabbit on the fourteenth day after injury. The first change is a swelling of some of the axis-cylinders in the outer parts (Vanlair) of the nerve-bundles of the central end, and this is followed by subdivision of each into from two to five new axis-cylinders (Ranvier). The new cylinders grow in length, and form within the old sheath of Schwann whole bundles of new nerve-fibres (Fig. 286 e), which usually distend the lumen of the sheath and compress any persisting remnants of the older fibres (/). According to Vanlair they sometimes burst the old sheath, and then either grow out amid the tissue of the endoneurium, or penetrate the perineurium of the bundles into the epineurium. Fig. 286.

They consist at first of new-formed axis-cylinders surrounded by a protoplasmic nucleated sheath (Vanlair), and presently they receive a homogeneous envelope of connective-tissue (e) formed at the expense of the protoplasmic sheath, and a thin medullary sheath which grows between the latter and the axis-cylinder.

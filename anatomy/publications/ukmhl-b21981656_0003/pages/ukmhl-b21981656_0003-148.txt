132 THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. [CHAP. LXXXIII. their capillaries at length disappear, the thicker fibrous bundles which surround the alveolar ducts being the last to go. The epithelium is passive throughout and often shows signs of degenerative (especially fatty) change. Sometimes the tissue is Fig. 222. Chronic vesiculab emphysema.

Chronic emphysema may be due, like the acute variety, to persistent inspiratory over-distension of the lung-tissue. This occurs chiefly in cases where parts of the lung are collapsed and functionless (Art. 592), and the neighbouring parts (Fig. 221 g) are accordingly over-distended. We might describe this as vicarious or compensatory emphysema. It is sometimes lobular, sometimes lobar in its extension. The emphysematous lobules are inflated and the alveoli abnormally large. On the other hand emphysema also results from persistent and violent expiratory efforts, in conditions which interfere with the egress of air from the alveoli, ingress being unimpeded. This is

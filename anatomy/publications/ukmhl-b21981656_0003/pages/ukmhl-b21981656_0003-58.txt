THE URINARY ORGANS. [CHAP. Lxyin. 42 which are soft and transparent, or firm and waxy. The firmer kinds stain with iodine a somewhat deeper brown than the sur- rounding structures, but do not usually give the typical amyloid reactions. In the meshes of the intertubular connective tissue we frequently find cellular infiltrations (I), a sign that a certain amount of inflammation accompanies the other changes. Sometimes too there is a certain amount of fibrous hyperplasia and induration. We have already discussed (Arts. 57—62) the aetiology and the significance of the amyloid degeneration. As to the fatty degene- ration which accompanies the amyloid change in the kidney we must assume that it is mainly the effect of the same agencies as the latter, though no doubt the disturbances of the circulation occasioned by the amyloid deposits have something to do with it. The accompanying inflammatory changes too are probably a third effect of the same causes. In support of this view it is to be noted that now and then (Nauwerck) the presence of bacteria in the vessels of the amyloid kidney can be demonstrated.

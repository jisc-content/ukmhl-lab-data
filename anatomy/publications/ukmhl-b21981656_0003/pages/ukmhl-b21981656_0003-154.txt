138 THE RESPIEATORY ORGANS. [CHAP. LXXXV. alveoli are red blood-corpuscles, and the inflamed region has a dark-red or brown colour. In catarrhal inflammation the contents of the alveoli consist mainly of liquid and small rounded cells with some admixture of larger squamous cells (Fig. 225). When these larger cells are the more numerous (Fig. 227 c) the affection is often spoken of as desquamative catarrh, the assumption being that the large cells are detached alveolar epithelial plates. This is however by no means always the case, for such cells are not infrequently developed from extravasated leucocytes. A portion of lung affected with catarrh looks red, greyish-red, grey, or greyish-yellow according as it contains much or little blood; on pressure it yields a greyish liquid more or less mingled with blood. Croupous inflammation is characterised by the coagulation of the exudation, fine threads of fibrin appearing between the cells contained in the extravasated liquid (Fig. 226) and making the whole cohere into a compact semi-solid mass. * ****** mmm*4 Fig. 225.

(Injected preparation stained with haematoxylin: x 80) An alveolus filled with a coagulated exudation containing red and white corpuscles and epithelial cells Coagulated exudations of this kind consist chiefly of liquid mingled with red and white blood-cells and epithelium, coagulation setting in as the white blood-cells dissolve. Another form of coagulation is observed in exudations containing many large cells (Fig. 227) and tending to become caseous at a

THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. [CHAP. XCII. 230 accumulate the cyst may attain a large size. The filum terminate and some of the spinal nerves connect it with the cord. It seems at first natural to suppose that the three varieties of malformation just described are due simply to morbid accumulation of liquid in the central canal, in other words to hydromyelia combined with a local meningeal dropsy: this view has been taken by many authors (Forster, Ahlfeld, and others). The anatom- ical characters presented by a myelomeningocele are however inconsistent with the supposition, and make it more probable that during the evolution of the central nervous system the medullary •tube was imperfectly differentiated off from the surface or epi- dermic epiblast (Ranke, Virchow, Tourneux, Martin, Mar- CHAND, etc.). This at least explains the fact that the cord so frequently passes out with the sack, and that the central canal sometimes opens freely into its cavity. When the cleft in the integument becomes closed over and the membranes of the cord are developed, liquid collects partly in the subarachnoid space and partly in the lower end of the central canal. It is however a question whether in some cases hydromyelia alone may not lead to myelomeningocele. Nothing certain is known as to the causation of meningocele. Perhaps here too the malformation depends on the imperfect differentiation of the cord-substance from the epidermis. Eeferences:—Virchow, Virch. Arch. vol. 27, Krankh. Geschwiilste ij Leyden, Virch.

Particular parts of the central nervous system are frequently ill-developed, and in consequence remain after birth abnormally small. The cerebrum is naturally the part which has attracted most attention in this respect. When it fails to reach the minimum size met with in healthy persons the condition is spoken of as micrencephalia: when the cranium as a whole is likewise abnormally small we have microcephalia. The average weight of the adult male cerebrum is 1375 grammes, that of the female 1245. The minimum weight for the male is 960 grammes, for the female 880; the maximum for the male 1800, and for the female 1600 grammes. The brain of a

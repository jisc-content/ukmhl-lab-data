347 ART. G70.] TUMOURS. At times most of the nodes are confined to a single nerve. Other nodes, and these occasionally very large, consist of a plexus of many nerves united into a mass by hyperplastic fibrous tissue. The nerves are all thickened, nodular, fusiform, convoluted, twisted, or otherwise distorted (Fig. 289), so that a coil of ravelled and Fig. 289. Plexiforh neurofibroma of the sacrdm. (Natural size: from a drawing by P. BRUNS) a convoluted strands laid bare by dissection 6 as they appear covered with fibrous tissue varicose cords is formed, the whole being held together by fibrous tissue. Such a growth is described as a plexiform neurofibroma. According to P. Bruns the cords contain numerous nerve-fibres, and it is therefore probable that new-formed nerve-fibres as well as fibrous tissue take part in its construction. Of the other connective-tissue growths sarcoma, myxoma, and lipoma occur in connexion with the nerves. The external forms they assume are similar to those of fibroma, but they are never multiple.

Tumours (fibroma, fibrosarcoma neurofibroma) occur more frequently on tho auditory than on other cranial nerves; see ViRcnow (op. cit.), and Axel Key (Scirskildt af Nordiskt med. Arkiv xi 1879).

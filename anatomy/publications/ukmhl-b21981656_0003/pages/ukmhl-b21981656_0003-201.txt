185 ART. 620.] TUMOU11S AND PARASITES OF THE LUNGS. croupous exudations within the bronchi and trachea, etc. wc occasionally meet with a micrococcus which subdivides like Sarcina into tetrads, and has accordingly been regarded as a minute variety of that species (Heimer). It usually occurs at the same time also in the pharynx and larynx, and has probably no causal connexion with the respective diseases in question. It is however not impossible that it may have the power of setting up inflammation where it settles. Of the filamentous fungi or hyphomycetes we find in the lung the bovine Actinomyces, and various forms of Aspergillus and Mucor. The former is the only one that possesses any great pathological importance: the others, with O'idium, settle only in decomposing lung-tissue, stagnating secretions, or haemorrhagic infiltrations. The above-named mould-fungi now and then proceed to the stage of fructification within the lung. Eeferences on fungi in the lung or pneumonomycosis :â€”Virchow, Froriep's Notizen 1846, Virch.

Patients affected with it spit blood for a number of years, and their lungs contain encysted brownish-yellow ovoid Psorospermia and clear or pale- yellow non-encysted granular round or ovoid Coccidia (Art. 250). The affection is also met with in Formosa, and according to Manson is due to the presence in the lung of Distoma ringeri, of which Baelz's Psorospermia are said to be merely the ova (Med. Times and Gaz. 2, 1881 and 2, 1882, Brit. Med. Journ. 2, 1882).

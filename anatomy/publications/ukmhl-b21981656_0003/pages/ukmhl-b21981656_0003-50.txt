CHAPTER LXVIII. RENAL DEGENERATION AND NECROSIS. 534. When poisonous or otherwise noxious matters are ex- creted by the glomerular and renal epithelium, or when the nutrition of the renal tissue is impaired in consequence of changes in the blood or in the circulation, degenerative changes make their appearance in the glomeruli and tubules, and these changes are generally demonstrable by careful microscopic examination.

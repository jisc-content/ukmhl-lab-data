170 THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. [CHAP. LXXXVII. substances it must be kept in mind that they often include not only tubercle-bacilli but also other micro-organisms and chemical products of decomposition from the diseased cavities, and these may give rise to suppurative, or fibrinous, or even putrid inflammations. ■rigiggt ^^4&-^fSS%!?£\ 8 « K»i Fig. 237.

The course of the new inflammation is in general this— there is first an abundant cellular exudation; after some days or weeks this forms a nodular infiltrated patch (Fig. 237 / g), which then becomes caseous in the centre (/), while the periphery (g) consists of living cells. By proper staining-methods bacilli (h) can be shown lying singly or in groups both in the caseous and

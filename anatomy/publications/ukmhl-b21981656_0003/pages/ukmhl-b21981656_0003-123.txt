ART. 578.] 107 THE TRACHEA. ulcers are sometimes the seat of papillary excrescences partly covered with stratified squamous epithelium. After tracheotomy granulations sometimes spring from the internal wound, and seriously obstruct the air-passage. Primary tumours of the trachea are rare. Fibroma, sarcoma, chondroma, osteoma, adenoma, and carcinoma, have been observed. Secondary growths due to extension from the oesophagus or thyroid gland are more common. Cysts arise from retention of secretion in the mucous glands. They are usually situated on the posterior wall and may be as large as a walnut: as a rule they protrude into the space between the trachea and the oesophagus. Eppinger asserts that the mucous glands may become distended with air forced into them through their ducts. References on tracheal syphilis :—Gerhardt, Deut. Arch. j. klin.

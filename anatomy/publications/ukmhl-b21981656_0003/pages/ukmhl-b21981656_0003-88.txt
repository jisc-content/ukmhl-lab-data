CHAPTER LXXI PYELITIS AND PYELONEPHRITIS. 553. When irritant substances are excreted by way of the kidney they frequently set up inflammation in the mucous membrane of the pelvis (pyelitis) and ureter. Thus catarrhal, croupous, and diphtheritic inflammation of this membrane may follow or accompany typhoid, scarlatina, small-pox, pyaemia, diphtheria, cholera, nephritis, etc. and the use of drugs like cantharides, copaiba, cubebs, turpentine, etc. When the irritant matter ceases to be excreted the inflammation usually comes to an end also. These secondary or symptomatic inflammations are not so serious as the more independent and progressive inflammations set up and maintained by the presence in the renal pelvis of parasitic organisms or urinary concretions. In speaking of parasitic pyelitis we note in passing that tuberculous pyelitis, already described (Art. 549), is due to the invasion of a bacillus. In like manner micro-organisms give rise to the pyelitis which sometimes accompanies suppurative or septic nephritis. Another purulent or suppurative variety is caused by the action of micro-organisms reaching the pelvis from the bladder through the ureter. The latter micro-organisms are usually micro- cocci, though bacilli and filamentous fungi may also reach the kidney by this channel. They enter the bladder as a rule through the urethra, but cases occur in which they break into it from abscesses in the rectum, uterus, vagina, or pelvic connective tissue. Bacteria are often introduced into the bladder by means of dirty catheters. In other instances they attack the urethra primarily (as in gonorrhoea), and extend gradually as far as the bladder. Their lodgment in the bladder is favoured if there be any interference with the evacuation of the urine, such as is caused by stricture or paralysis. When the bladder is incompletely emptied so that some urine remains in it for a considerable time the bacteria which enter it find time to multiply and set up changes

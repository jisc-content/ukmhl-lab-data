THE NASAL CAVITIES. 93 ART. 568.] organisms to lodge in the mucous membrane. In many chronic cases the bone underlying the mucous membrane likewise undergoes atrophic change. Frankel thus speaks of simple ozaena as rhinitis chronica atrophica foetida. Croupous and diphtheritic inflammation of the nose is usually secondary to the like affection in the throat (Arts. 423—426). Phlegmonous inflammation (Art. 427) is usually due to extension from neighbouring parts, though it is sometimes confined to the nose. Ulcerative inflammation is in most cases due to syphilis (Art. 429) or to glanders (Art. 430). Lupous (Art. 392), tuberculous (Art. 428), and leprous (Art. 430) infiltration and ulceration are also met with, but they are rare. The syphilitic and tuberculous affections of the nose frequently begin in the periosteum of the nasal bones and give rise to more or less extensive destruction of the osseous tissue. All the inflammatory affections of the nose may extend by continuity to the cavities and sinuses connected with it and there take on a more or less independent character, the cavities becoming filled with mucous or purulent secretion. From the frontal or ethmoidal sinuses the inflammation may extend into the interior of the cranium and so give rise to meningitis. Beferences on ozaena :—Huppert, Begriff und Ursachen der Ozaena In.

The nasal mucous membrane is not infrequently the seat of hyperplastic growths and of tumours, due partly to chronic inflammation, partly to unrecognised causes. They take the form of polypous excrescences and are usually referred to as nasal polypi. Soft or mucous polypi resemble the mucous membrane in

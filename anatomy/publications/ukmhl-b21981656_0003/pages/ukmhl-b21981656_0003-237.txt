221 ART. 629.] STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS. A common source of brain-affections, especially of the inflam- matory kind, is disease of the adjacent structures, such as the base of the skull, the petrous bone, the skull-cap, the nose and its cavities, etc. The contents of the cranium and vertebral canal are in communication by means of blood-vessels and lymphatics with the surrounding parts, and thus inflammatory mischief may invade the brain and cord not only by direct extension but also through the blood and lymph. Lastly, both brain and cord are much exposed to injury by traumatic violence of the most various kinds, and in conse- quence undergo a great variety of morbid changes which are often extremely grave.

246 THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. [CHAP. XCIV. In acute destruction of the ganglion-cells, such as occurs in the neighbourhood of inflamed areas, after sudden compression, anaemic and haemorrhagic softening, and so on, the cells and their processes frequently swell up (Fig. 250) and become pale and hyaline (a). Sometimes vacuoles appear, and the nuclei partake in the general swelling. After a time the cells split up and dissolve away (c^), the nuclei at the same time disappearing. Fatty degeneration of the cells may also occur (aa) under the same conditions, but it is more common in cases where chronic or recurrent disorder of the circulation leads to defective nutrition of the cells. In such cases it may be the only change that is perceptible: it may occur in patches or extend over the cortex. Fatty change of this kind is met with in many forms of mental disease. When the ganglion-cells have once perished, whether from inflammation, anaemia, sudden compression, or other cause, and do not at once dissolve, they sometimes undergo calcification (Fig. 251), becoming as it were tightly crammed with particles and spherules of calcareous matter. Friedlander found a calcified ganglion-cell thirteen days after a wound of the part. In chronic diseases the cells sometimes take on a glistening wax-like appear- ance, a change which has been described as sclerosis of the ganglion-cells. Fig. 251.

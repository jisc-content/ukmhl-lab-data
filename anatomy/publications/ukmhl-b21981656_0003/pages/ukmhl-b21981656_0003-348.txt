332 PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. [CHAP. XCIX. vessels of the nerve-trunk run in these fibrous envelopes. At the peripheral ends the axis-cylinders break up into primitive fibrils, and these terminate in the various peripheral end-organs. In the course of some of the nerves (especially of the sympa- thetic) are one or more clustered groups of ganglion-cells: when these are large enough to be easily visible they are called ganglia. The cells and fibres of such a ganglion lie in a fibrous stroma whose elements are in direct continuity with the fibrous structures of the corresponding nerve. The morbid changes occurring in the nerves affect partly the nervous elements, partly the fibrous framework. In many respects the changes correspond to those affecting the central nervous system, but they also offer remarkable peculiarities of their own.

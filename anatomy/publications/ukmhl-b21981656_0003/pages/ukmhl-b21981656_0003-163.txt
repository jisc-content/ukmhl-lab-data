ART. C01.] PULMONARY INFLAMMATIONS IN GENERAL. 147 matters inhaled and on the mode of experimentation. When finely-divided irritant substances, such as spray of phthisical sputum or of putrid liquids, are inhaled, small miliary bronchopneumonia foci are produced. When the inhaled matters are coarser or of larger volume, and of an irritant nature, we have large usually lobular patches of inflammation with haemorrhage, suppu- ration, or gangrene, as the case may be. When the foreign matters are bulky enough to occlude one or more of the bronchioles the first effect is partial collapse or atelectasis. Large quantities of liquid quickly introduced into the lung may lead, as in drowning, to death by asphyxia. The liquid is carried with the inspired air into the alveoli, and fills them with a mass of froth. Eeferences :—Art. 596; Traube, Beitriige z. Path. u. Phys.

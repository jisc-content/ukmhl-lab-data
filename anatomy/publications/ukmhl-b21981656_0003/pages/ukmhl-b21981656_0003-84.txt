THE URINARY ORGANS. 68 [CHAP. LXIX. detritus occupies the pelvis, which latter by excavation or by retention of urine is abnormally large. In extreme cases the entire kidney is destroyed, nothing remaining but a thick-walled sack containing cheesy or puriform detritus. As a rule both kidneys are affected, though it is common to find the process much more advanced in one kidney than in the other. 550. Syphilitic affections of the kidney exhibiting any special or characteristic features are not common. Renal inflam- mation referable to the influence of the syphilitic poison is how- ever occasionally met with, and is characterised by the formation of coarse cicatricial bands and of caseating gummata. In congenital syphilis induration and contraction of the kidney has in somewhat rare instances been observed.

In syphilitic patients we not infrequently find the kidney in a state of amyloid degeneration (Moxon, loc. cit.). In tuberculosis of the urinary organs Rosenstein and Babes (Cent. f. d. med. Wisi. 1883) have demonstrated the presence of tubercle-bacilli in the urine.

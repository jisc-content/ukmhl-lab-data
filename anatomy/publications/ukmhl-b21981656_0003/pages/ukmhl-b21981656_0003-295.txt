279 ART. 649.] SIMPLE AND DEGENERATIVE ATROPHY. or the adventitial coat is denser than usual. Sometimes too the adventitial lymph-sheaths contain lymphoid and granule-carrying cells, while leucocytes in varying number are scattered through the surrounding nerve-tissue. Most of the nuclei that are visible belong however to the neuroglia-cells, which have a scanty protoplasm and a large number of glistening processes (Art. 638, Fig. 253). The feltwork is in fact essentially composed of the interlacing processes of these cells. A few corpora amylacea occur here and there. The softer and more gelatinous patches have a looser felt- work, with wider meshes and interstices. Those that are mottled with white contain numerous granule-cells and other products of nerve-disintegration. If they lie within the grey matter they sometimes contain also atrophied and shrunken or hyaline and swollen ganglion-cells. The affection is commonest in the cord, and varies very greatly in its extent. There is nothing special about the manner in which the patches are distributed: they may lie anywhere in the grey matter as well as in the white (Figs. 268, 269, 270). When they interrupt conducting tracts, more or less extensive secondary degeneration of these ensues, but it is surprising to note how frequently the latter change is absent even when the sclerotic patches are pretty large. If the sclerosis should cause the destruction of ganglion-cells in the anterior horns some of the anterior root-fibres of course become atrophied. Fig. 268. Fig. 269. Fig. 270.

320 THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. [CHAP. XCVII. cysts (Fig. 282, Fig. 283 d) separated merely by stings of epithelial cells (e), so that the epithelium forms a kind of stroma enclosing cysts formed of connective-tissue. Epithelial pearls, or concentric globes (h), are sometimes formed in the midst of the masses of epithelium, and look wonderfully like those met with in cutaneous cancers (Art. 172), while contrasting sharply with the cylindrical cells of the growth. Pig. 283. Papillomatous carcinoma with gelatinous degeneration of the stroma from the third ventricle. (Section hardened in Mailer's fluid, stained with alum-carmine: x 25) a fibrous stroma with blood-vessels d cyst in degenerate stroma, with b partially mucoid papilla coagulated contents c mucoid papilla coagulated by the e f interpapillary strings and nests of hardening fluid cells Cj hyaline masses h epithelial pearls The tumour is usually confined to the ventricle, and leads to compression of the brain-substance (Fig. 282 fgh) and ventricular dropsy (i). It may however invade the brain-substance, and give rise to secondary nodules (Spaet). It is not certain whether this form of tumour occurs as a primary growth in any other region, but it is quite possible that it may arise say about the anterior or posterior transverse fissure, or at the base of the brain near the infundibulum: it probably developes from aberrant germinal epithelium (Art. 181). Cholesteatoma, or pearly tumour, is one whose mode of origin is not well understood: it is a growth characterised by the presence in it of white rounded 'pearls' with a nacreous lustre. It occurs chiefly in the dura mater of the base of the brain about the transverse fissures, but it is also found in the interior of the organ. The soft white mass of the growth consists mainly of epithelial

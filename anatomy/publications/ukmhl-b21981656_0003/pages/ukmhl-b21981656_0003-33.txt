ART. 525.] DISORDERS OF THE RENAL CIRCULATION. 17 epilepsy, tetanus, asphyxia, pyrexia, or lead-poisoning). Cohnheim regards it as due to ischaemic degeneration of the glomerular epithelium. Transient anaemia gives rise to no demonstrable change in the renal structures, but in more chronic conditions degeneration and atrophy of the tubules and glomeruli make their appearance. The deficient supply of blood and consequently of oxygen also leads to fatty change in the renal epithelium, which if it is at all extensive gives the section of the kidney a spotty or mottled appearance. If the blood-supply is entirely cut off general necrosis of the tissues ensues (Art. 527). Slight but long-enduring interference with the blood-supply causes the essential elements of the kidney to dwindle and shrink, so that the bulk of the organ as a whole is gradually diminished. 525. Renal anaemia, in addition to the epithelial changes it induces, is very often accompanied by atrophy and obliteration of certain parts of the vascular system, of the organ. These are most marked when they affect the glomerular capillaries. A normal glomerulus (Fig. 202 b) appears as a tuft of capillary vessels each covered with an investment of nucleated cells; those of an atrophied or functionless glomerulus on the other hand form a compact more or less homogeneous spherule with few nuclei or none (Fig. 202 d, Fig. 203 b). This spherule may show traces of Fio. 202. Senile atrophy oj? the Kidney.

255 SIMPLE AND DEGENERATIVE ATROPHY. ART. 640.] and even this may be ultimately removed by absorption. At length all but a very few of the cells and fibres (a a, b) disappear, and the anterior horn comes to consist chiefly of neuroglia. Simple uncomplicated atrophy is not accompanied by any change of the connective tissue, and there is no trace of inflammatory mischief; moreover it is only when the nerve-fibres are involved and their medullary sheath is undergoing disintegra- tion that even granule-cells are detected, and these in very small number (Art. 638). Sometimes secondary sclerosis follows. Simple atrophy may therefore be described as a primary affection involving simple loss of the nervous elements of the grey matter of the anterior horn; it leads to atrophy of the anterior roots of the spinal nerves, and paralysis with atrophy of the muscles supplied by them. It may attack any portion of the anterior columns, but most frequently begins at the upper or the lower extremity and thence extends. In the former case the motor nuclei in the medulla are usually soon involved, while in the ascending forms this is naturally a late symptom. The sensory nuclei in the medulla and the posterior columns of the cord are in general unaffected.

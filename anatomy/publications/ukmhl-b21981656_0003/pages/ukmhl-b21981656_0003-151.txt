CHAPTER LXXXIV. DEGENERATIONS OF THE LUNG. 595. The non-inflammatory degenerations of the pulmo- nary tissue are of comparatively slight importance, and have no practical interest for the physician. Emphysema and senile atrophy may form nominal exceptions, and they have already been discussed in Art. 594. Swelling, fatty degeneration, and desquamation of the pulmonary epithelium accompany every copious transudation into the alveoli, inflammatory or non-inflammatory. The inhalation of deleterious substances also leads to manifold injury of epithelium, blood-vessels, and fibrous stroma; but the changes so induced are of altogether secondary importance in comparison with the inflammation which is at once set up. Among degenerative changes due to disorders of nutrition we may mention fatty degeneration of the epithelium and amyloid degeneration of the fibrous structures. The former occurs in emphysema and in poisoning by phosphorus and arsenic, the latter in conditions which lead to the like change elsewhere. It is however to be kept in mind that the lung is on the whole but rarely the seat of amyloid change, and that the walls of the blood- vessels are most apt to be affected. Calcification of the fibrous stroma of the lung is rare, except in cases where the tissue has been morbidly altered by antecedent inflammation. References :â€”Buhl, Lungenentzundung Tuberculose u.

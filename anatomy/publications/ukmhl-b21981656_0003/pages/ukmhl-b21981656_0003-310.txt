In later stages accumulations of leucocytes (i^, and in smaller quantity red blood-cells and brown or yellow pigment appear in the adventitial sheaths of the cortical vessels, and sometimes even of those supplying the white matter. But no great accumulations of cells are as a rule met with in the mass of the brain-substance itself. The cellular infiltration is not uniform, varying much even within the tissue of the pia Fig. 273. Cheonio meningoencephalitis with ateophy of the coetex.

ART. 594.] ATELECTASIS, COLLAPSE, AND EMPHYSEMA OF LUNG. 133 the case in the important variety described as chronic idiopathic diffuse emphysema or simply general emphysema, an affection which is very common in persons subject to chronic bronchial catarrh or to frequently-recurring expiratory dyspnoea, or obliged to make violent expiratory efforts in connexion with their employment. This form of emphysema extends over the whole lung, though it is usually most marked at the edges and apices of the lobes, and at the base. When the lung is removed from the thorax it appears abnormally large, its edges obtuse and rounded, and the base frequently studded with hemispherical bladder-like promi- nences. The air-vesicles are everywhere enlarged by the dis- appearance of interalveolar septa, sometimes so much so that they look like bullae and range in size from that of a pea to that of a hen's egg. The latter is chiefly the case at the edges and base, and there as a rule only in the lung-tissue immediately beneath a Fio. 223. .Rarefied pulmonary tissue in emphysema. {Injectedpreparation: x 20) a infundibular vesicles produced by disappearance of interalveolar septa b larger vesicles produced by coalescence of infundibular vesicles the pleura. The smaller vesicles (Fig. 223 a) are formed by the disappearance of the interalveolar septa belonging to a single infundibulum ; the larger vesicles (b) to the disappearance of the partitions between adjacent infundibula.

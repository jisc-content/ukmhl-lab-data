TUMOURS AND PARASITES. ART. 662.] 315 bulging or thickened appearance. Dilatation of the central canal and excavation of the growth itself are common (syringomyelia, Art. 635). Fig. 281. Angiomatous glioma. (Frontal section through the brain) a right hemisphere b glioma in left hemisphere As we have mentioned in Art. 145 the tumour is made up of branched neuroglia-cells, though the number and size of the cells present in different growths is subject to great variation. When they are small and scanty, and their ramifying fibrils numerous and closely felted, the texture is dense and firm: when the cells are large and numerous the tumour rather resembles a sarcoma. The cells are in general uniformly scattered through the mass, but now and then they appear to lie in small clusters: multinuclear cells are common, especially in the peripheral parts of the growth. The vessels are frequently much dilated (Fig. 41), and so abundantly developed that the tumour is fitly described as telangiectatic or angiomatous. The vessel-walls are often thick- ened and hyaline, and there is hyperplasia of the adventitia, the vessels being thus surrounded by a thick envelope of cellular and fibro-cellular tissue. Round the veins there may be accumulations of white blood-cells. The tumour grows by proliferation of the neuroglia and multiplication of its cells: at least this is as much as can be made out by examination of the growing margin. The nerve-fibres as they are encroached on perish, their axis-cylinders becoming notably swollen before they break down. The ganglion-cells and their nuclei also swell in a remarkable way, and become homo- geneous and glassy in appearance. Later on they break down like

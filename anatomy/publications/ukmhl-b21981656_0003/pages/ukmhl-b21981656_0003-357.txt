CHAPTER CII INFLAMMATION OF PERIPHERAL NERVES AND GANGLIA. 669. Neuritis, or the inflammation of nerves, is characterised anatomically by the presence of an exudation in their fibiws framework. If the exudation is chiefly liquid and the blood-vessels are still filled, the inflamed nerve looks red, and swollen, and abnormally moist: if the exudation is cellular (Fig. 287) and the hyperaemia has disappeared there are no apparent signs of the affection, though any haemorrhage that has taken place may be indicated by reddish or brownish-yellow discoloration. In simple nerves the migrated leucocytes lie chiefly in the thicker trabeculae of the endoneurium (Fig. 287 d) through which the vessels run, though they may also pass in between the individual nerve-fibres (c e). In compound nerves (Fig. 288) the exudation frequently lies almost entirely in the epineurium. The perineurium of the Fig. 287. Chronic nkuritis.

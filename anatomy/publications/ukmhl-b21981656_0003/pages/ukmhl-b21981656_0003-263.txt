247 ART. 638.] SIMPLE AND DEGENERATIVE ATROPHY. for example a portion of the brain or cord is destroyed by traumatic violence or by anaemic or inflammatory softening, the disintegrated tissue contains nerve-fibres whose sheath consists of myeline in a peculiar state of coagulation (Fig. 252 a), together with naked or sheathless axis-cylinders (ccj, free drops or globules of myeline (d), and small spheres (e) of fatty detritus derived from the disinte- gration of myeline. The axis-cylinders are sometimes unaltered, sometimes greatly swollen (Cj), with such irregular and wavy outlines that they have been described as varicose. Soon they become fragmented and are absorbed ; sometimes however globular masses of altered myeline accumulate at certain points of their length and thus give them a varicose appearance (b) from another cause. The process of degeneration is similar in cases that are chronic or less acute, as in the peripheral parts of nerves that are severed from their centres (Art. 646). <$ h. K c a Fio. 253.

The fibrous nodes and bands are coarsely-fibrous with few cells, or mainly cellular. Some of the nodes are caseous in the centre, giant cells being often found in the zone between the caseous matter and the non-necrosed tissue. By appropriate treatment a few scattered bacilli can be demonstrated. Sometimes these indurated patches also contain typical tubercles. The septa of the remaining portions of the lung are frequently infiltrated with cells and more or less thickened. This morbid change may extend over the greater part of the lung, and then leads to a form of contraction and induration which we may fitly describe as nodose tuberculous cirrhosis. Usually however it is confined to a limited portion of the lung, other changes being set up which lead to a different result. Even in cases where the cirrhosis is at first the characteristic feature ulceration is never entirely absent. The process may

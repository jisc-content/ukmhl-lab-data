THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 142 [CHAP. LXXXV. and at length in the pleura also. These cells develope into fibrous tissue in the usual way (Art. 108), and so give rise to thickening of the affected parts and consequently to diminution of the respiratory spaces. As collapse very commonly accompanies this fibroid change the thickened alveolar walls speedily come into contact and cohere, and the corresponding alveolar cavities are obliterated. Some of the alveoli however may remain open, and these become lined with short cylindrical epithelial cells, so that on section they somewhat resemble the acini of a gland. Not infrequently the fibrous hyperplasia in the alveolar walls is accompanied by a like development within the alveoli: large epithelioid formative cells (Fig. 228 d) make their appearance in the alveolar contents, and growing out as bands or strings of cells (e) or as bud-like processes from the alveolar wall traverse the exudation in various directions. At the same time buds and out- growths spring from the capillaries of the alveolar wall (g); these push their way into the new tissue and being transformed into blood-vessels provide for its nutrition. The whole process corre- sponds closely with that by which a thrombus is organised (Art. 255). Fig. 228. Growth of fibeous tissue in the walls and in the contents of an alveolus.

Its colour varies from white to slaty-grey or even black, according to the amount of pigment present.

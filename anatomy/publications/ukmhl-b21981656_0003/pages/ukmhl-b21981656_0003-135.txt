ART. 584.] STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE LUNGS. 119 The tubes which are thus partially transformed into respiratory tissue are known as respiratory bronchioles. Each respiratory bronchiole divides into two or three smaller branches, which are surrounded on all sides by alveoli (B) and are known as alveolar ducts. The terminal alveoli are called infundibula. As the smaller bronchi pass into the respiratory bronchioles they alter notably in structure. The cartilages disappear, and the epithelium is reduced to a single layer of low non-ciliated cells, which ultimately take the form of broad polygonal pavement cells (Kolliker). As the respiratory bronchiole changes to an alveolar duct these modified columnar cells in turn disappear, and the epithelium takes the form of small nucleated granular-looking pavement cells interspersed with larger hyaline plates some with and some without nuclei. The muscular fibres of the bronchioles persist as annular bands surrounding the orifices of the lateral alveoli and of the terminal infundibula. The epithelium of the alveoli is like that of the alveolar ducts. Their walls consist of a delicate membrane strengthened by scattered filaments and bundles of elastic tissue. They are devoid of muscular fibres. The clustered alveoli belonging to each bronchiole are not quite contiguous, but are separated by spaces which are filled by other groups of alveoli and infundibula. The contiguous groups are bound together by connective tissue. In preparations made by maceration or corrosion the alveolar ducts of each bronchiole appear thus to stand apart from each other; while in sections (Fig. 220) the alveolar tissue looks like a continuous meshwork, interspersed with transverse and longitudinal Fio. 220.

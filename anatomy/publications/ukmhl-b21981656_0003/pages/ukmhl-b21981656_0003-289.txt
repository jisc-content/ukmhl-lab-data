These tracts connect the various segments of the cord with each other and with the medulla, and include root-fibres which run longitudinally for a certain distance within the cord before passing out with the roots. The direct cerebellar tracts are invariably exempt. In an ascending direction the disease has been traced up to the pons and crura cerebri, but no further. We are thus ignorant of the upper limit of the change, and it is quite possible that it sometimes extends up to the cortex. In the anterior horns it is chiefly the most anterior ganglion- cells which perish (Fig. 265 a); those of the intermedio-lateral tract are scarcely if at all affected; while those of Clarke's columns are quite exempt.

(Section through the cervical cord: x 10) a anterior horns, the ganglion-cells of which have almost all disappeared b diseased region of the lateral column corresponding to the completely decus- sated pyramidal tract Of the motor nuclei of the cerebral axis those of the hypo- glossal, facial, and spinal accessory nerves are the most liable to atrophic change; and to a very much less extent those of the abducens and trigeminal nerves. Details regarding the limits to which the atrophy may extend are unfortunately lacking. In proportion to the atrophy of the motor ganglion-cells in the cord and medulla we have of course progressive atrophy of the corresponding motor nerves and muscles. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is from a pathological point of view closely akin to anterior poliomyelitis, or spinal paralysis with wasting of the ganglion-cells in the anterior horns (Arts. 640, 659). s. p.

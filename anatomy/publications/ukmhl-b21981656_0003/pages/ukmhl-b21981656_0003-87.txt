71 ART. 552.] RENAL CYSTS AND HYDRONEPHROSIS. altogether, the sack consisting in great measure merely of fibrous tissue, which in cases of old standing may be of remarkable thickness. At first the liquid is simply urine; but as the pressure increases less and less urine is excreted, and when the renal tissue atrophies the excretion ceases altogether. The sack however continues to increase in size, owing to the secretion of liquid by the mucous membrane of the pelvis and calices. This liquid contains no urinary matters, but is albuminous; and sometimes it is tinged with blood. Colloid masses and cholesterin are also found in some cases. Hydronephrosis is usually confined to one side, it is rarely bilateral. When the obstruction affects only a part of the pelvis of the kidney, or when there are two pelves, the hydronephrosis may be partial. References :â€”Virchow, Gesamm. Abhandl.

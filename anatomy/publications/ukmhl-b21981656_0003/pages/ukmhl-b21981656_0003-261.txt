CHAPTER XCIV. SIMPLE AND DEGENERATIVE ATKOPHY. 638. In all degenerative processes affecting the central nervous system the nerve-elements are the first to disintegrate and disappear, while the neuroglia frequently persists unchanged or actually increases. Ganglion-cells atrophy by simple shrinking of their proto- plasm without visible change of structure; when they lose their processes they appear as little shrunken specks (Figs. 257, 258, Art. 640) and at length disappear altogether: this is simple atrophy. Pigmented ganglion-cells as they shrink appear to be still more deeply tinted; indeed it sometimes looks as if the actual amount of pigment were increased during the atrophic process. This form has been called pigmentary atrophy. Fio. 250. Degeneration of cells and fibres from the cerebral cortex.

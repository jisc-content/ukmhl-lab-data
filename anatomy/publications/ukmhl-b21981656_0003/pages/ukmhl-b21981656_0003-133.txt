THE BRONCHI. 117 ART. 583.] indurated by chronic inflammation. The destructive process may advance not only peripherally but also along the course of the peribronchial lymphatics: in this way suppurative and caseous peribronchitis are not infrequently set up. Ulceration and perforation of the bronchi from without are associated with suppuration, gangrene, and caseation of the paren- chyma of the lung: they are extremely common. Caseous or suppurating lymphatic glands, peribronchial tumours, and aneur- ysms, occasionally break through the bronchial wall. When a bronchus is thus perforated the broken-down tissues and detritus pass into its lumen and are either coughed up or aspirated into other parts of the lung. Air on the other hand may enter the excavation from the bronchus. On the tumours of the bronchi see Art. 619.

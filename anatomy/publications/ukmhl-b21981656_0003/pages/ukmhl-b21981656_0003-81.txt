The depressions and contrac- tions are usually somewhat redder. The renal tissue is dense and tough, the cortex thinned, the papillae often truncated or stunted. The tint of the cut surface corresponds with that of the external surface: the medulla is generally somewhat redder, but not infrequently it has much the same tint as the cortex. The cortical zone is always traversed by fibrous bands with s. p. a. 2 5

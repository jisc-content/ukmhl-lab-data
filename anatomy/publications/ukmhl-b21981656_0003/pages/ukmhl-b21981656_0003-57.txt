These parts all become thickened, homogeneous, and translucent, and yield the familiar amyloid reactions. Fig. 208. Amyloid kidney with fatty degeneration.

The extension of the fatty change is not proportionate to that of the amyloid change : it may be extreme when the latter is slight, and inversely. The convoluted tubules are frequently the most affected. Their epithelium is not only fatty, but loosened and disintegrated (/)• When this change is marked, and some of the glomeruli become at the same time impermeable, small patches of the renal parenchyma may atrophy and disappear, and so give rise to contractions. If these lie near the surface they appear as small cicatricial depressions. The loose epithelial cells naturally fall into the lumen of the tubules, and may there form cylindrical masses of fatty cells or fatty detritus. Others of the tubules contain hyaline cylinders,

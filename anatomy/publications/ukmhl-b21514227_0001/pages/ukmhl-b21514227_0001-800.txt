Still every one of them may be de- monstrated with a little care, in the whole of the Brachyura and of the Macroura. They are less numerous, and are singularly modified in proportion as we recede from these types. In the Squilla mere vestiges only of the ap- paratus are found in two semicorneous pieces covered with rounded projections; and its functions are performed by a branch of each mandible which penetrates even to the pyloric orifice of the stomach. The intestine extends from the pylorus to the anus without curve or convolution in its course {Jig. 416, d,h). In the superior Crustacea a, stomach; 6, intestine; c, left lobe of the liver in its natural state ; d, right lobe dissected, so as to show its structure and the disposition of the biliary ducts. it may be distinguished into two portions, one of which may be named the duodenum, the other the rectum. These two portions where they occur vary extremely both in their nature and in their relative lengths. Sometimes they are separated by a valve (Lobster) corresponding internally to a circular external elevation; but still more frequently their respective limits are not obviously marked, and among tlie whole of the inferior members of the family the intestinal canal is entirely cylindrical, and per- fectly identical in its constitution through its whole length. The anus is constantly seated in the last ring, and is closed by certain mus- cular fibres which perform the office of a sphincter.

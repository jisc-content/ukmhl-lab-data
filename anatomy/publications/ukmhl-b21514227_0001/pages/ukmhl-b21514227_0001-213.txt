AORTA. 189 the chest well formed, uud the heail and the arch of the aorta fiee from disease, the origin of the aorta is opposite the sternal articulation of the cartilage of the fourth rib of the left side in the male, and the intercostal space above it in the female; the ascending limb of the arch, which is behind the middle bone of the sternum in the greater part of its length, may be felt pulsating on the right side of the sternum in the second intercostal space; the highest part of the transverse portion of the arch IS on a plane with the centre of the sternal extremities of the first pair of ribs, and about an inch below the upper margin of the ster- num : the arch of the aorta terminates oppo- site the lower edge of the cartilage of the second rib of the left side. The thoracic aorta descends in the posterior mediastinum, and advances from the left side to the front of the thoracis portion of the spine, crossing in its course the left intercostal veins, and the left vena azygos when that vein exists; in front it is covered by the left bronchus, the pos- terior surface of the pericardium, the lower ex- tremity of the cesophaijus,and the left stomachic cord pf the par vagum ; on the right side it is bounded by the cesophagus, thoracic duct, and vena azygos ; on the left side it is covered by the pleura, and in contact with tiie internal surface of the left lung, and at its lower extremity the left splanchnic nerve comes into contact wiih it, and most frequently accompanies it through the diaphragm. The ubduminul aorta, which enters the abdo- men between the ciura of the diaphragm, des- cends along the front of the abdominal ver- tebrae and the left lumbar veins; it is covered in front by the solar plexus of nerves, the stomach, pancreas, transverse portion of the duodenum, the splenic and left renal veins, the small intestine, and the root of the mesentery; on the right side it is bounded by the abdomi- nal vena cava, and the commencement of tlie thoracic duct, and on the left it is covered by the peritoneum going to form the left layer of the mesentery. The termination of the aorta in the common iliacs and the middle sacral arteries is a little below the level of the um- bilicus. A remarkable deviation from the c\lindrical form, which is one of the general characteristics of the arterial system, is observable in two parts of the arch of the aorta; the first of these occurs at the commencement of this vessel in form of three dilatations corresponding to the semilunar flaps already described ; they were first pointed out by \'aisalva, and have received the name of the lesser sinuses of the aorta; they exist at all periods of life, and increase in size with years ; the other deviation from the cylindrical form is a dilatation on the right side of the ascending limb of the arch at its junction with the tiaiis- verse portion ; this dilatation, which does not exist in the foetus, grows larger as life advances, and appears to be produced by the impulse of the blood striking against this part of the aorta at each successive systole of the left ventricle. Tiie aorta in the succeeding part of its course gradually grows smaller in a degree proportionate to the size of the branches it gives off. The thickness of the aorta is proportionally less than that of its branches; it is thinner at its commencement than in the arch, in which part, according to Haller, it is thicker by an eighth on the convex than on the concave side; it gradually diminishes in thickness as it descends through the thorax and abdomen, but its power of resisting distention instead of being dimi- nished in an equal degree was found by V\ in- tringham to be greater at its lower part than near the heart.* The structure of the aorta is the same as that of the rest of the arterial system in general; its external tunic, however, is slighter than that of all other arteries except those of the brain, it is weaker the nearer it is examined to the origin of the aorta ; it is strengthened near the heai't by the covering which the serous layer of the pericardium gives to the aorta, and by an expansion from the fibrous layer of that mem- brane, which is lost on the transverse portion of the arch. The cellular sheath of the aorta in which the soft fat around its origin is deposited, becomes so fine where the vessel is passing out of the pericardium as to lead some anatomists to deny its existence in this situation ; it becomes more evident in the course of the descending aorta through the mediastinum, and is still more considerable around the abdominal aorta, where it is usually loaded with a considerable quantity of adipose substance. The branches which arise immediately from the aorta may be divided into orders, according to the degree of remoteness or the relative size and importance of the parts which they supply with blood ; first, the branches which convey blood to the two extremities of the trunk and the limbs attached to them ; these arteries, which are of considerable size, are the arteria innominata, the leftc arotid ar,d left subclavian, which, arising from the transverse portion of the arch, are distributed to the head, neck, and upper extremities, and the primitive ilii.c arte- ries which arise from the lower part of the abdominal aorta supplying the pelvis and the lower extremities. 2nd order.—Branches some- what smaller going to the thoracic and abdomi- nal viscera and the parietes of the chest and abdomen; the coronary arteries which supply the heart arise from the aorta immediately after its origin; the bronchial arteries which supply the substance of the lungs, and the intercostal arteries supplying the parietes of the chest arise from the thoracic aorta; the cceliac, su- perior and inferior mesenteric, which supply the digestive organs; the renal arteries which supply the kidnies ; the spermatic going to the organs of generation, the inferior phrenic sup- plying the diaphragm, and the lumbar arteries going to the parietes of the abdomen and lum- bar region of the spine, are the vessels of this order which arise from the abdominal portion of the aorta, ,3rd order.—Branches of much smaller size are sent from the aorta to se- * Experimental rnquirv on some par(5 of the Animal Structure, London, 1740.

PREFACE. To collect a series of Essays on all the various subjects of Anatomy and Phy- siology, by the co-operation of several Authors, who, as far as possible, should be selected in consequence of their special attention to, or interest in, the subject-matter of the articles which each would undertake to furnish, was the object of the Editor in projecting the " Cyclopasdia of Anatomy and Physiology." The successful inauguration of a similar work on Practical Medicine, which had advanced some way prior to the commencement of this Cyclopcedia, afforded great encouragement to the Publishers and to the Editor to prosecute their design. The first part was published in 1835, twenty-four years ago. It was then calculated that twenty parts would complete the book, and that not many years would have been sufficient for that purpose. A glance at the Table of classified Contents will show the multipli- city of topics on which it was proposed to treat: — Anatomy, both as it regards man and all the tribes of inferior creatures,—Anatomy de- scriptive, — Anatomy physiological or histological, — Comparative Anatomy, —Morbid Anatomy, general and speciah To these were to be added: Physiology (human and comparative) ; some brief notice of Vegetable Physi- ology ; the Anatomy and Physiology of the ditferent classes of Animals, in- volving, in many instances, much reference to their Zoology ; and lastly Animal Chemistry, including the physiology of the fluids and seci'etions.

This pro- minence in the Sepia is of an oval shape ; but in the TeuthidiB it forms a narrow, elongated, cartilaginous ridge, and is adapted to a cor- responding groove at the sides of the funnel. In the Calamary the ridge is of the same size with the groove ; but in the Onychoteuthis the ridge or antero-lateral cartilage commences at the anterior margin of the mantle, and extends downwards some way below the termination of the infundibular groove.

Loligopsis, viz. on either side and towards the ventral aspect, a thick, opaline, elongated cartilage, extending longitudinally for more than half the length of the mantle, and sup- porting a series of wart-like processes. These lateral tuberculated cartilages in Loligopsis we regard as corresponding to the lateral ridges in the Calamaries and Onychoteuthis above-men- tioned ; but in the Loligopsis they are not arti- culated with the sides of the funnel, which are otherwise attached to the mantle. In all the Decapods, however, this pair of cartilages on the ventro-lateral aspects of the mantle is more or less developed. In the Sepia a longitudinal cartilage is situated on the ventral aspect of the liver. The long lateral fins are, in the same genus, each supported by a narrow, flattened, elon- gated, cartilagmous plate {t>, D, Jig. 2\2); pointed at its anterior extremity, obliquely truncate behind; smooth and gently concave internally (g), but traversed by an irre- gular longitudinal ridge (h) on its external surface. These cartilages form the points of attachment to the powerful muscles of the lateral fins. From the dorsal ridge of each cartilage a number of close-set fibro-cartila- ginous laminae extend at right angles to the cartilage to near the margin of the fin, with their plane in the direction of the axis of the body : they alternate witli the strata of mus- cular fibres, resembling the lays which support the fins of fishes. The analogy of this structure to the cartila- ginous basis of the great pectoral fin of the Itay is so close and satisfactory that we can scarcely hesitate to acknowledge the locomotive appen- dages of the mantle in the Decapodous Cepha- lopods as representatives of the pectoral fins of fishes, and consequently of the anterior extre- mity of the vertebrated animal. As they are not, however, fixed to a vertebral column, then- situation is not constant, being sometimes, as in llossia, situated towards the anterior part of the body; sometimes, as in Loligo, placed at the posterior extremity ; just as we perceive the ventral fins of Fishes shifting their position, in consequence of a similar want of connexion, so as to occupy, in some species, a position more anterior even than the pectoral fins, with- out losing their essential character, as the ana- logues of the posterior extremities. The cartilages of the fins correspond in length to the parts which they support, and are con- sequently much longer in the Cuttle-fish than in the Calamaries; in the Octopods they are entirely wanting. Locomotive System. â€” The organs of loco- motion in the Cephalopods are of two kinds, one consisting of appendages developed from the head ; the other of rudimental fin-like ex- tremities developed from the trunk ; the latter organs are confined, as we have seen, to the Decapodous genera of the higher or I)ibraii- chiate Order. The cephalic processes, which are called digitatioiis, arms, feet, tentacles, and pedun- cles, have no real homology with the loco- motive extremities of the Vcrtebrata ; to these they are analogous only, inasmuch as they

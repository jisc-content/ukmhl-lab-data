696 CONCHIFERA. Fig. 345. (ft, fig. 346) placed at the anterior part of the animal is deeply hid- den between the foot {b,Jig. 346), and the anterior retractor mus- cle ((•) in the Dimyaria, and under a kind of cowl formed by the mantle in the Mono- niyaria. The mouth is in the form of a trans- verse slit, comprised between two lips, ge- nerally thin and nar- row, as in almost all the Dimyaria, or lo- bated and digitated, as in some of the Monomyaria, (a. Jig. 348). The lips ex- tend on either side in the form of two flat- tened smaller appendages, more or less elon- gated, occasionally truncated, streaked or laminated on their internal surface, and to which the title of labial palpa has by general consent been given, {d, pg. 346, r, fig. 348.) The mouth in the Conchifera never presents any part that is hard. In the greater number of these animals it terminates without any intermediate passage in a stomach, the form of which is subject to but little variety. When there is an oesophagus {a, Jig. 347), it is variable both in point of length and capacity; it has nothing constant, relatively to the other distinctive characters of the groups established among the conchifera generally: thus it either occurs or is wanting indifferently among the individual members of the dimyarian and mo- nomyarian families. The stomach {b, Jig. 347, d,fig. 348) is a membranous pouch, commonly pear-shaped,

ALBINO. 87 This conjecture was shortly after verified by Buzzi of Milan, who look advantage of an opportunity which presented itself, of dissecting the eye of an Albino, in which the pigmentum nigrum could not be detected.* He also ex- amined the structureof the skin, which appeared to be deprived of the rete mucosum, that part of it in which its specific colour is supposed to reside ; the hair was also found to be deficient in its central coloured part.f Whether, in these cases, the pigmentum nigrum of the eye and the rete mucosum of the skin are absolutely deficient, or are only deprived of their colouring matter, so as not to be detected by the eye, is a point on which different opinions have been formed by anatomists; J perhaps, upon the whole, we may be induced to consider the lat- ter opinion as the most probable. What are the circumstances in the consti- tution of the parents which should lead to this peculiarity in their offspring is entirely un- known, nor have any conjectures been formed on the subject which can be considered as even plausible.§ The hypothesis of Buffon, which at one time obtained a considerable degree of credit, that white is, as it were, the primitive colour of nature, which, by various external causes, is changed to brown or black, but which the body has always a tendency to resume under favorable circumstances,|| is completely without foundation : nor does it appear that we can explain it upon the principle, that do- mestication and the habits of civilized life have a tendency to produce a lighter shade of the complexion, because we trace no connexion between the supposed cause and the effect, * For some remarks " on the colour of the pigment of the eye," and its effect on vision, as applicable to the eye of the Albino, see Hunter, p. 243 . . 253 ; also Blumenbach, 51. " Capillorum cum cute consensus," and 53, " Iridcs oculorum cum capil- lorum colore consentientes." t Sachs gives us a minute account of the analysis of the hair of the Albino, compared with Vauquelin's analysis of hair in its ordinary state, from which it appears that no iron could be detected in it. t Blandin, Diet.

Compl. t. xv. p. 250 et seq. Is. St. Hilaire essentially adopts this hypo- thesis, ascribing the peculiar state of the skin to an " arret de developpemcnt," in consequence of which the colouring matter is not formed at the requisite period, p. 319,0. The idea, that it depends upon something peculiar in the seminal matter of the parent, which was maintained by Herodotus, Thalia, j. 101, and was controverted by Aristotle, Hist. Animal, lib. 3. cap. 22, has been revived by Mau- pertuis. Diss. 2, and by Pauw, t. i. p. 179, and t. ii. p. 21. Le Cat refers the colour of the negro to a pecu- liar substance, which he names " iEthiope animal," which he supposes is contained in their fluids, ana- logous to the black inky matter of the cuttle fish ; par. 2. art. 1 ; the absence of this substance con- verts the negro into an Albino.

We may remark that this spcculdtion of Buft'on's is precisely the reverse of that of Hunter, p. 243 et seq. and because the production of the Albino is complete in the first instance, and not brought about by any gradual or progressive alteration. It appears that we must come to the con- clusion, that although the anatomical or phy- sical cause of the peculiarity is ascertained, yet that we are entirely ignorant of its remote cause, or of that train of circumstances which leads to its production.* * " The following cases have not been referred to in the body of the article; DelaNux, Hist.

For the following epitaph, which appears to have been written on an Albino child, we are indebted to a literary friend, the Rev. Jos. Hunter. *' Upon Thomas, son of Ric. Elmhurst by Mar- garet his wife, daughter to Ric. Mickletliwaite : whose promising parts, were interrupted by an early death. "... This boy no Albian was, yet gray hair'd borne Who saw old age and night as soon as mornc. His grave's a cradle ; there his God him lay'd Betimes to sleep lest he the wanton play'd. Bid him good night! i'th bed of dust sleep on Until the morne of Resurrection. " Anagram. " Lo Earth misseth me, 1632." From the Church of Worsborovgh, Com. York. Bibliography.—Amieux, in Journ.

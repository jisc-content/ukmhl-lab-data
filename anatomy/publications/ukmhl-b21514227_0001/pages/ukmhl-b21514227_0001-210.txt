ANUS. 186 occur, then, that hardened feces impacted in the rectal pouch, which is above this point, may assist in obstructing the more free flow of blood, and thus encourage the enlargement of these anal veins, and the same effect may be still further induced by the muscular pres- sure employed in defaecation; in support of this view we find that children are almost free from this varicose condition of these veins, unless under peculiar circumstances ; and in the adult it usually occurs in those of con- stipated habit of bowels; it is also relieved or removed by attention to their functions. The true hsemorrhoidal tumours, external as well as internal, must be regarded as essentially dif- ferent from a varicose condition of the anal veins, although they are often connected with the latter, and it must be admitted that in some cases they may owe their origin in a great measure to venous dilatation. Varices of the anal veins are simple dilatations either of a trunk or of some of the branches of these vessels ; their cavity is continuous with that of the vein, and freely communicates with it, and pressure on the varix empties it of its contents ; its tunics are the venous coats and the membrane of the intestine; whereas hteraor- rhoidal tumours are wholly distinct from the veins, and are either simple cysts, lined by a smooth membrane, or they are composed of a spongy cellular texture, not nnlil<.e the erectile tissue. This latter is usually the con- dition of recently formed haemorrho.ds, whereas in those of long standing the single or divided cyst is the ordinary structure ; this cyst will be found to contain a little blood, partly fluid and partly coagulated ; and when the internal surface is minutely examined, one or more fine pores will be visible, the orifices of ca- pillary vessels, through which warm water, if steadily injected by the inferior mesenteric artery, will exude on the surface. In the cellular or more recent haemorrhoids the texture ap- pears very vascular, soft, and spongy, as also the surface of the tumour, from which blood or serum will sometimes exude during life. These cellular h8emorrhoids in time become circumscribed, the cellular texture becomes more or less perfectly absorbed, and the cyst- like structure becomes more developed ; how- ever a very recently formed haemorrhoid may, and sometimes does, present a distinct cyst or cavity, as may be readily conceived when we consider the process whereby these tumours come to be developed, which, as far as our observation extends, is as follows: from con- tinued irritation from any exciting cause, such as disease of the intestine or anus, worms, or from a local plethoric condition, spontaneous, as far as we can know, the capillary circulation is increased in the loose submucous tissue in this region, a small quantity of blood, or lymph, or serum, is effused into it, perhaps from the rupture of some small vessels, or exhaled from their dilated extremities. A slight degree of inflammation attends this con- dition : the part affected, that is, the cellular tissue, becomes more highly organized, thick- ened, vascular, and spongy. After some time, this increased vascular action subsides, and in process of time the whole may nearly dis- appear, but in general a part of this more highly organized spongy tissue remains, it being fully supplied with nourishment; the absorbents in due course modify its appear- ance ; the surrounding thickening is removed, as also some portion of the cellular mass, and thus the formation of the hoemorrhoidal cyst is completed. A structure like this, con- nected with the capillary system, must be influenced by the same causes as can affect the latter ; thus irritation local or general, me- chanical injury, or general or local plethora are all capable of exciting increased action in it, and of inducing all those symptoms and changes which are so well known to attend during haemorrhoidal inflammation. Fistula in ano is a disease of such very fre- quent occurrence, and so well understood and described by every surgical writer, that it is scarcely necessary to do more than allude to it in this place: strictly speaking it is not a disease of the anus, as that opening is in general totally unaffected, except as regards its functions: it should rather be regarded as a disease of the anal region. There is one form of fistula in ano, however, which is seated on the very confines of this opening; it is trou- blesome and distressing, attended with heat, itching, and excoriation, pain during defeca- tion, and constant purulent or sero-purulent discharge: without due attention it may be overlooked by the surgeon, as the orifice is so close to the anus as to be concealed by the natural rugae, and so small as only to admit a lachrymal probe; the sinus is not more than an inch or half an inch long; its internal opening is on the very edge of the anus, the whole is immediately under the skin, and does not involve any other structure; it is not pre- ceded by regular abscess, neither does it or the treatment necessary for its cure involve the sphincter or any other structure, except the fine integuments; it most probably originates in irritation of some of the anal sebaceous follicles, and sometimes two or three of such fistulae may exist at the same time. The true or deep fistula in ano has its origin in deep-seated aljscess commencing close to the rectum, or in the centre of the ischio-rectal space of either side: when in the former, some mechanical irritant or some disease of the intestine may have been the cause or origin of the abscess ; when in the latter, it often arises without any obvious reason, hut frequently appears to have been connected with some peculiar delicate or morbid con- dition of the constitution. All abscesses in this situation do not necessarily end in fistula; if they have been small, superficial, opened early, and treated judiciously, they may be healed as perfectly as abscesses in any other situation; but when deap-seated, of slow growth, and long continuance, and when de- pending on some deep-seated mechanical irri- tant or on constitutional causes, then the ab- scess usually attains considerable size, and having opened either into the rectum or through

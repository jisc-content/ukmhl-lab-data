ABSORPTION. 29 that, except under peculiar circumstances, they reject every other substance.* When the elements of Ae chyle have been received into the lacteals, it appears to undergo a certain degree of elaboration, by which it is farther assimilated and perfected, an operation, the intimate nature of which we are unable to explain, but which, as well as its entrance into the mouths of the vessels, we correctly refer to their vital action. After the chyle has entered the lacteals, there is less difficulty in conceiving the subsequent steps of the process. We are at least able to generalize the operation, by referring it to contractility, the same power which ori- ginates motion in other parts of the system. It must, no doubt, be admitted, that the exis- tence of the muscular fibres of the lacteals has not been satisfactorily demonstrated, and that, until tliis has been accomplished, our opinion can only be regarded as hypothetical : but we have here the advantage of being able to assign a probable and sufficient cause of the effect, and are aware of the point towards which we mast direct our future investigations.! Before we conclude this branch of the subject, we may remark concerning the contents of the lacteals, that, under ordinary circumstances, we have no decided proof of these vessels containing any substance except the elements of the chyle, and that, although in some of die experiments referred to above, extraneous bodies have been occasionally found in them in minute quantity, these cases must be regarded as exceptions to the general fact. With respect to the chyle itself, it has been a subject of examination by the chemists, whe- ther Its properties are always uniform in the same animal, or class of animals, under the various circumstances of age, constitution, and still more of diet, to which they are subject. But it may be necessary, before we enter upon this inquiry, to premise a few remarks upon the meaning of the terms chyme and chyle. By the older physiologists they were very gene- rally employed as synonymous, and this is still the case with some of the modern writers, more especially on the continent.| A clear distinc- tion between them has, however, been pointed out and recognized, and as there appears to be an essential difterence between them, it is desi- rable that it should be generally adopted. The first of these substances is the immediate pro- duct of the action of the gastric juice on the aliment, as received into the proper digestive stomach, while the latter is the substance which is produced by a subsequent part of the pro- cess of digestion. The conversion of chyme โข See the remarks of MM. Chaussier and Atle- lon, ubi supra, p. 272 ct seq. ; also Adeion, Physiol, t. iii. p. 85 et seq. ; and Alison's Out- lines, p. 79. t This is essentially the doctrine of Haller, Prim, liin. c. XXV. ยง.568. Sheldon, p. 28, and Cruik- shank, c. 12, are advocates for this doctrine; but it is opposed by the high authority of Mascacni, DS. i. sect. 4. p. 27, 8. t This appears to be the ca'e with M.

There is, however, reason to believe that the completion of the process takes place in the lacteals themselves, and even that it is not until the chyle arrives at the thoracic duct, or at least at the great trunks of the lacteals, that it is fully elaborated. The nature of the change which the chyme expe- riences in the duodenum, and the agents by which this change is effected, what share the secretions of the part itself, the bile, or the pancreatic juice have in the operation, are questions that still remain in discussion, and which will be considered in the appropriate parts of this work.* For the analysis of the chyle we are prin- cipally indebted to Vauquelin, Marcet, and to Dr. Prout. Vauquelin employed the chyle of the horse, as taken from the large trunks of the lacteals and from the thoracic duct.f The experiments of Marcet were principally directed to the inquiry, how far the chyle of the same kind of animal was affected by dif- ferences in the diet, according as it consisted principally of animal or vegetable substances.! Dr. Prout's experiments on the chyle extended both to its general properties, and to the dif- ferences produced by different kinds of diet, while, in addition to these points, he entered into a very interesting examination of the suc- cessive changes which it experiences, from its first entrance into the lacteals until its final deposition in the thoracic duct.ยง The result of these experiments, as far as our present inquiry is concerned, tends to shew that the vegetable chyle differs somewhat, in its physical and chemical properties, from that of animal origin, and that the chyle, when it first enters the lacteals, is in a less perfect state, while it be- comes more assimilated to the blood in pro- portion as it advances towards the thoracic duct. With respect to the means by which the animalization of the chyle is perfected after it enters the vessels, we have no certain informa- tion, and we have scarcely any analogy which may assist in guiding our opinion. What is termed by modern physiologists the action of the vessels, by which so many operations of the animal economy are supposed to be effected, we may regard rather as an expression which serves as a convenient veil for our ignorance, than as throwing any light upon the process. We have no evidence that any addition is made to the chyle while in the lacteals ; and indeed we can scarcely suppose it possible that this is the case, so that the only conceivable effect of this action is reduced to the motion which is imparted to the chyle by the alternate contrac- tion and relaxation of the vessels, in conse- * See the remarks of .'Vdelon, art.

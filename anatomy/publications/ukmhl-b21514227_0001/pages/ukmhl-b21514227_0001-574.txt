CEPHALOPODA. Fig. 231. Nervous System of the Pearly Nautilus. it affords a fixed point of attachment, and is not extended upwards so as to inclose the brain : this part is defended by a strong mem- brane which loosely surrounds it; but the ex- tremities of the transverse band, the optic gan- glions, and the anterior oesophageal collars rest in grooves of the cranial cartilage. The nerves which arise from the anterior collar are very numerous : the larger branches (6, 6) enter respectively the roots of the ten- tacles which are lodged in the digital pro- cesses : the ophthalmic tentacles are also sup- plied from this source (5*); no lateral con- necting filaments are found between these nerves, corresponding to those which associate the corresponding nerves of the Poulp for the simultaneous action of the parts they supply. Below the digital nerves small nerves are given off (12), which enter the external labial processes, and penetrate in a similar manner the roots of the tentacles which are there lodged. The internal labial processes are, however, supplied in a different manner: a larger nerve (7, 7) comes off on each side near the ventral extremity of the ganglion, and after a course of half an inch swells out into a flattened ganglion* (8, 8), from which nu- merous filaments (9, 9) extend into the sub- stance of the process, and are continued into the tentacles as in the preceding case ; a larger twig (10) inclines inwards and distributes fila- ments to the olfactory laminae. The infundi- bular nerves (11) come off near the lower part of the anterior collar. From the ganglions composing the posterior collar (4, 4) arise numerous nerves of a flat- tened form, (13, 13,; which pass in a radiated manner to the inner sides of the shell-muscles * These ganglions I believe, from subsequent examination, to have been also connected with a niTvous twig from the fleshy mass of the mouth, derived from the supra-oesophagcal ganglion.

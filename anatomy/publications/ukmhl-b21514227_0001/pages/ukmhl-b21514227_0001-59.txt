ACALEPII^,, 35 is too fi'pquently met with in the reasoning of physiologists. We do not perceive, in either case, how it can be referred to tliis power, nor liow it can be employed in any way to explain or elucidate the effects that are produced.* It is admitted that the chyle is elaborated during its passage along the lacteals, and be- comes more nearly assimilated, both in its phy- sical and chemical properties, to the blood. Still, however, its complete sanguification does not take place until it leaves the lacteals, and it becomes a very interesting subject of inquiry, by what means this is effected ; in what degree the function of respiration contributes to it, whether the abstraction of carbone and the in- troduction of oxygene, which is supposed to be effected by the passage of the blood through the lungs, is the immediate cause of the con- version of chyle into blood ; whether it be brought about more gradually, by the removal of the various secretions and excretions, or whether there be any particular organ, which may more especially produce the change in question. These are all of them points of high interest, but as they are concerned in an indi- rect manner only with the subject of this article, and as they will be considered in the appro- priate parts of this work, we shall not pursue the inquiry any further.

ACALEPHiE(from azaArjipv), a nettle); syn. urticamarina. Fr. Acalephes; Germ. Aca/ephen ; the name of a class of invertebrate animals. They are all inhabitants of the sea, and are such as are commonly known by the names of sea- jelly, sea-nettle, Portuguese man-of-war, &c. It is from the property, which many of these animals possess, of irritating the surface of our skin so as to produce nearly the same effect as that resulting from the sting of a common nettle, that the class derives its name. Aristotle used the word ay.a,X-ri(pyj to de- signate some of these animals ; but it was by Cuvier that the class was formed, and the term acalephce applied to it. As this class now stands in the last edition of the Rcgnc Ani- mal, (t. iii. p. 274,) it is formed chiefly by the animals constituting the Linnaan genus Medusa and les aculcphes lit/drosiatiques of Cuvier. On many accounts the acalephas are objects of extreme interest to the anatomist and phy- siologist. They have occupied the attention of the most learned naturalists of every age, from the time of Pliny until the present day ; their numbers are, perhaps, greater than those

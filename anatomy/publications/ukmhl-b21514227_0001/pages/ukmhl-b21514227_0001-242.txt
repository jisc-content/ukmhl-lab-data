ARM. 218 brachial artery usually preserves its ordinary relations to the surrounding parts, while the supernumerary trunk lies to its internal side and takes a more superticial course, some- times getting above the fascia of the arm, as we have witnessed in a few rare cases. It occasionally happens that the brachial artery divides at its commencement into two trunks, which again unite at its lower part. It is ob- vious that the surgeon, in performing operations on this artery, should constantly bear in mind that it is subject to the above-mentioned irre- gularities, and that he should cautiously guard against committing the error of including the wrong vessel in his ligature. The internal side of the arm in the middle of its length is the most eligible place for making compression on the brachial artery; here this vessel is superficial, so that its pul- sation can be felt at once, whilst it has nothing interposed between it and the bone but the tendinous insertion of the coraco-brachialis muscle. It happens, however, that the median nerve lies immediately over the artery in this situation, a circumstance which causes com- pression of the latter to be attended with con- siderable pain, and productive of injury to the nerve if maintained for too great a length of time. As the trunk of the brachial artery and several large nerves traverse this part of the arm, it is obvious that wounds in this region are liable to be attended with more serious consequences than those of any other part of the arm. A wound in the posterior region of the arm may be attended with considerable haemorrhage, if it should happen to penetrate so deep as to divide the profunda artery, or it may cause paralysis of the extensor muscles of the hand and fingers by dividing the radial nerve. When the humerus is fractured, the con- sequent derangement of the fragments varies according to the part at which the bone hap- pens to be broken ; when fracture occurs im- mediately above the insertions of the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, the lower fragment is brought inward towards the axilla by the action of these muscles, and drawn upwards by the action of the deltoid, biceps, coraco- brachialis, and long head of the triceps, whilst the extremity of the upper fragment is rather turned outwards by the supra-spinatus. In cases where the humerus is fractured imme- diately above the insertion of the deltoid and below the attachments of the latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major, the deltoid will draw the lower fragment upwards and outwards, whilst the upper fragment will be drawn inwards towards the axilla by the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi. If the bone be broken im- mediately below the insertion of the deltoid, little or no displacement of the fragments may ensue, as the opposing forces exercised on the superior fragment by the deltoid on the ex- ternal side, and the pectoralis major and latis- simus dorsi on the internal, pretty nearly counterbalance each other; it more generally happens, however, that the upper fragment is turned outwards by the preponderating action of the deltoid upon it, whilst the lower frag- ment is drawn upwards by the action of the biceps, coraco-brachialis, and triceps. Frac- tures of that portion of the humerus which is covered by the brachiKus anticus in front and the triceps behind, are often unattended by any very obvious displacement, in consequence of these muscles being inserted into both frag- ments ; fractures near the elbow are occa- sionally followed by deformities presenting some of the characters of dislocations of the elbow, of which more notice will be taken in the article Elbow. General inflammatory enlargement of the arm is rare; it sometimes appears as a con- comitant affection with inflammation of the veins of the arm consequent on the operation of phlebotomy, in which case it not unfre- quently happens that abscesses form along the course of the sheath of the brachial artery ; red streaks along the course of the lymphatics and enlargement of the lymphatic glands are sometimes present in consequence of disease or inflammation affecting the hand or fore-arm. Amp\itation of the arm below the insertion of the deltoid may be performed either by the circular incision or the double flap; when the latter method is practised, the flaps should be formed on the external and internal sides, by which the more important vessels and nerves will be included in the internal flap. When circumstances require the performance of amputation above the insertion of the del- toid, the circular operation should never be practised, for the following reason;â€”in order to obtain a sufficiency of covering for the bone, the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and teres major would all be detached from their inser- tions, a consequence of which would be that the contractions of these muscles in opposite di- rections, by drawing asunder the edges of the wound, would not only render complete appo- sition difficult in the first instance, but more- over their continued action would have the effect of converting the wound into an ulcer, which it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to heal; therefore, whenever we have to amputate so high up, it is the more judicious mode of proceeding to make a flap including so much of the deltoid muscle as will form a sufficient covering for the stump. The importance of attending to the foregoing circumstances was first pointed out by Louis, the learned secretary to the French Academy of Surgery.* The arteries which require to be tied after amputation of the arm below the insertion of the deltoid are the brachial and inferior pro- funda on the internal side ; on the external side there are often two branches of the superior profunda requiring a ligature, one of which accompanies the musculo-spiral nerve, and the other runs in the substance of the triceps. When it becomes necessary to tie the bra- chial artery on account of a wound or aneu- rism, the varieties of its relation to the median nerve should be carefully borne in mind; at the upper part of the arm this artery has the median nerve external to it, and the ulnar nerve to its inner side; in the middle of the * Memoires de I'Academic de Chirurgic, torn. v.

PREFACE. contingencies to which all works ai'e liable, when they are published in Parts, and dependent for regularity of publication on the punctual contribution of the various articles. Where such punctuality could not be obtained, and where it was found absolutely necessary to curtail delay, the changes above alluded to were adopted as a matter of necessity rather than of choice. Thus, Ear is referred to Hearing, Organ of; Kidney to Ren. The union of certain articles together under one heading was sometimes found both convenient for treating the subjects, and oeconomical of space. Thus^ the Anatomy of the Brain was conveniently associated with that of the Spinal Cord, and will be found under Nervous Centres ; that of the Intestinal Canal under Stomach and Intestinal Canal (Dr. Brinton) ; and that of the Ovary in the elaborate article of Dr. Farre, Uterus and its Appendages. Serous and Synovial Membranes have been treated of under one heading, from the close analogy of their structure; and Hairs, Nails, Skin, &c., ax'e described under the general title Tegumentary Organs. It was found absolutely necessary, owing to difficulties which otherwise must have completely prevented the completion of the work, to place several articles in a supplementary volume, regardless of strict alphabetical arrange- ment. But it is hoped that for this, as well as the other departures from the strict Encycloptedic form, compensation will be found in the various Indices, and in the Table of Classified Contents. 26 Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, London, Jan. 1859.

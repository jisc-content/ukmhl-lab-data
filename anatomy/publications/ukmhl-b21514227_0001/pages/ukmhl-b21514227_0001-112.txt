Ei/iceis- ssloff,) is one of the most important proximate principles of animal bodies ; it is tlie leading- ingredient of the blood, of many of the secretions, and of muscular fibre, cartilage, and membrane : the white of egg (whence the generic term albu- men) presents it in considerable purity, and it is from this source, and from the serum of the blood, that we chiefly obtain it for the purposes of experiment. In this article we shall describe the leading properties of albumen; and in others, refer to its principal modifications. The white of egg may be regarded as a combination of albumen with water; it con- tains small quantities of saline substances, v;hich are inseparable in its liquid state. When it is evaporated at a temperature below 120°, it dries into a brittle, shining, transparent sub- stance of a pale yellow colour, inodorous and tasteless. Its ultimate constituents, exclusive of saline matters and a trace of sulphur, are carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen ; of these the relative proportions have been deter- mined by Gay Lussac and Tlienard, who analysed the white of egg dried at 212°; and by Dr. Prout, who employed the dried serum of slightly inflammatory blood ; the following table shows its theoretical composition as con- trasted with these experimental results :— Atoms.

Two parts of white of egg and one of water entirely co- agulate when duly heated ; equal parts remain, under the same circumstances, semi-fluid; a mixture of one part of white of egg and ten of water becomes opaque, but is not coagulated ; and a milkiness is perceptible when the al- bumen only forms a thousandth part of the solution.* Fresh-laid eggs, and those which have been oiled upon the surface do not per- fectly coagulate when put into boiling water, in consequence, probably, of the dilute state of the albumen. One hundred parts of the fresh albumen of the egg, when carefully evaporated in vacuo, leave a residue = fifteen parts. One hundred parts of the coagulated white of a duck's egg (dried in vacuo with sulphuric acid) leave 13.65 parts, which, steeped in water, acquires its original appearance, but in four days only took up 68 of water, though it had lost86.35.t When albumen is made part of the voltaic circuit, it presents appearances dependent upon the power used, which, when considerable, excites so much heat as to coagulate it; but with a feeble power and the poles sufficiently distant, coagulation ensues most plentifully at the negative platinum wire ; a coagulum also forms at the positive wire, where acid is also sparingly evolved. These phenomena are much interfered with by the evolution of gaseous matters at the respective poles, which occasion a froth, and the appearance of more extensive coagulation than actually occurs. When coagulated white of egg is boiled for several hours, it shrinks up and becomes har- dened, communicating traces of animal matter to the water. Heated by high pressure steam in a copper digester to 400°, it blackens the interior of the vessel, and dissolves, leaving a small residue of unaltered albumen. The solution is brown, and has the odour of boiled meat (from osmazome ?). This action deserves further investigation.! White of egg soon runs into putrefaction, and evolves sulphuretted hydrogen. The se- rum of blood kept for two years in a well- stopped phial, blackened its interior, and be- came a stinking, pale, yellow liquid, still co- agulable by heat, and containing hydro-sul- phate, carbonate, and acetate of ammonia, and a fetid volatile matter: a portion of yellowish white purulent-looking matter, containing un- decomposed albumen, remained at the bottom of the phial. Coagulated white of egg, even under water, long resists putrefaction. * Bostock, Nicholson's Journal, vol. xiv. and Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. i. and ii. t Chevreul, |Mem, du Museum vii. 180.

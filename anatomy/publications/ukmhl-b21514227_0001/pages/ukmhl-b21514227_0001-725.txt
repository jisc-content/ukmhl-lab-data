Of' the 07'gans of respiration.— The whole of the Conchiferous mollusks respire by means of branchiae {e,e, Jig. 346). These or- gans are variously disposed according to the form of the animal. Tiiey are symmetrical; and in almost all the genera there are two on each side. The branchiae generally present the form of membranous leaflets, of a qua- drangular shape, tliough often unequal. They are broad and short when the animal is glo- bular, elongated and narrow when the animal is lengthened in its general form. In the greater number of genera the branchiae are formed of two membranous layers or lamina; («, I), Jig. 352) within the substance of which the branchial vessels descend with great regu- larity. In several genera, as tlie Archidae and Pecten, the branchial vessels, instead of being connected parallel to one anotlier within the thickness of a common membrane, continue unconnected through their entire length, and they are thus formed of a great number of extremely delicate filaments attached by the base within a membranous pedicle, in which the branchial veins pursue their way towards Fig. 352. 7^ the auricle. In a great many families and genera the branchiae of one side have no com- munication with those of the opposits side; in some others however, as in tlie genus Uaio, tiie four branchial laminae meet under the foot, and the whole of their vessels empty them- selves into a venous sinus of considerable size. 2 z 2

Ilaller, who fully admitted the greater capacity of the smaller arteries, and allowed that the flow of the blood must therefore, from hydraulic prin- ciples, become less rapid in passing from the trunks to their branches,—a proposition which he illustrates by comparing the stream of blood in its passage to a river which enters a lake,— was yet inclined, from the result of his actual observations, to deny that the velocity is much less in the smaller than in the larger arteries. Spallanzani, although admitting more explicitly still than Haller the necessity of such a retarda- tion, seems to have met with the same difficulty in reconciling theory with his attempts to mea- sure the velocity of the blood in the small ves- sels : and both these authors state, that although the circulation was in general comparatively slow in the web of the frog's foot, still in many instances in this situation, and more frequently in the mesentery, they were unable to detect any difference in the rapidity of the flow of the blood in the larger and smaller arteries.* Hales, again, states as the result of his ob- servations and measurements, that the velocity of the blood in the smallest capillaries of the abdominal muscles of the frog, is so small as one or one and a half inch in a minute | and, from the attempts which we ourselves have made at these measurements, we feel inclined to agree with the statement of this able experi- menter, having, upon several occasions, ascer- tained that in those capillaries which admit only two globules of blood, the velocity is not greater than the hundredth part of an inch in a second ; but it seems doubtful whether in all the capillaries the velocity is so small as in those just alluded to, and in the larger capillary vessels of the diameter of six globules, when no unnatural obstruction to the circulation in the limb occurred, independently of the diffi- culty of fixing the eye upon any globule in such a way as to trace its progress along the vessel, the velocity has always a]>peared so great as to prevent the possibility of measuring it; and we are at a loss to conceive in what manner Haller made the comparison he speaks of between the velocity in the larger and smaller arteries. By means of the microscope, it is easy to see that the velocity is greater in the small arteries than in the corresponding veins, which are both more numerous and considerably larger than the arteries. The results of actual observation of the flow of the blood and of the measurement of the relative capacities of different arteries, afford as yet very unsatisfactory data upon which to found an estimate of the relative velocity of the blood in the trunks and branches of the arte- ries. In the absence of more direct means of calculation, an approximative estimate may be made in another way, viz. by comparing the quantity of blood which occupies a known space of the larger vessels with the whole quan- tity of blood contained in the body. We have already seen that the whole blood * Haller appears to mean here arteries of consi- derable size. in the body may be estimated at nearly thirty pounds: now, let us suppose the aorta and pulmonary arteries, together with their return- ing veins, to form a continuous tube of the length of the two courses of the blood, in the systemic and pulmonic circulations, and of the same diameter as these vessels at their point of junction with the heart; a very simple calcula- tion shews us that such a tube is capable of holding only about six pounds and a quarter, or less than a fourth part of the whole blood of the body ; or in other words, were the aggre- gate capacities of the small vessels no more than equal to that of the larger, they would be capable of holding only a fifth of the blood contained in the body. The velocity of the blood in the commence- ment of the aorta may be considered as two and a half inches in a second, for this is the space occupied by all the blood which is pro- pelled into the aorta from the left ventricle in that time, and according to the arbitrary modes of estimating the relative capacity of the aorta and its branches here employed, the velocity of the blood in the aortic capillaries generally, might be considered as one-fourth of that in the commencement of the aorta, or nearly half an inch in a second, a result widely different from that obtained by Hales. Attempts have also been made to estimate the velocity of the flow of blood, by ob- serving the time which certain substances, when introduced into one part of the vascular system, take to pass to another. The most remarkable series of experiments of this na- ture with which we are acquainted were per- formed by Hering.* This author states that he has been able to detect prussiate of potassa, which he had introduced into one of the jugu- lar veins of a horse, in the blood drawn from the opposite jugular vein in the space of from twenty to thirty seconds ; and he has formed the conclusion from this experiment that the prussiate of potass, in order to gain the jugu- lar vein on the opposite side of the body, had passed in this remarkably short space of time through the whole course of the double circu- lation : that it was first carried to tiie heart, then passed through the pulmonary arteries and veins, and returned to the heart, from which it must have been transmitted through the ultimate ramifications of the systemic ar- teries before being brought back by the veins, in which it was found on the opposite side of the body. Hering states, as the result of other experiments of a similar nature made upon different bloodvessels, that the prussiate of potassa passed from the jugular vein to the saphena vein in twenty seconds; to the mas- seteric artery, in fifteen to twenty seconds; to the external maxillary artery, in ten to twenty- five seconds ; to the metatarsal artery, in twenty to forty seconds. We consider these curious experiments as important in many points of view, but do not feel inclined to concur in the conclusion de- duced from them by their author, that the * Tiedcraann's Zcitschrii't, vol. iii. p. 85.

The trans- parency of their contents rendered them less conspicuous and less easy of detection, so that, although certain parts of them appear to have been seen by Fallopio, and afterwards by Aselli and others, yet it was not until the year 1660, that they were distinctly recognized, and their connexions ascertained. The discii\ery of the lymphatic system was the subject (if a warm controversy between Bartholin and llud- bek, on the merits of which we are, after so long an interval, scarcely able to decide. It appears, however, to have been the opinion of Ilaller, and the most distinguished anatomists of the last century, that the lymphatics were detected, in the first instance, by Rudbek ; that Bartholin had some intimation of the dis- covery, that he then took up the subject, and pursued it much farther than it had been done by Rudbek.* There is a third individual, on whose behalf a claim of priority has been made, which pos- sesses at least considerable plausibility. We are informed by Glisson, that an English ana- tomist of the name of Jolifle distinctly re- cognized and exhibited the lymphatics of many of the abdominal viscera, previously to the alledged discovery of either Rudbek or Bar- tholin.f But even if we allow JolifFe the full merit both of discovering these vessels, and being aware of their specific nature, it does not ajjpear that he published his discovery, so that it will scarcely affect the rival claims of the former anatomists. The discovery of the ab- sorbent or conglobate glands, as they have been termed, was made, for the most part, at the same time with that of the vessels, as a ne- cessary consequence of the intimate connexion which subsists between them. After the existence of the lacteals had been clearly announced by Aselli, and of the lym- phatics by Rudbek and Bartliolin, the atten- tion of anatomists was very generally directed to these organs, and discoveries were suc- cessively made, by various individuals, of the presence of the latter in almost every part of the body, and in connexion with almost every one of its organs. The labours of William and John Hunter, of Monro sec , and of Ilewson, were among the most important in their re- sults, while we are indebted to Cruikshank, and still more to Mascagni, for their minute descriptions and accurate representations of the absorbent system, in all its parts, and with its various relations and connexions.]; ' El.

XXV. 1. 4 . . 8 ; THascagni, Vas. Lymph. Corp. With respect to the minute anatomy of the lacteals, we are informed that they originate from certain small projecting bodies, termed villi, wiiich are attached to tlie interior surface of the intestines, styled fiom this circumstance the villous coat. These villi are described as consisting of a number of capillary tubes, which terminate with open mouths, and that by the union of these tubes the brunches of the lacteils are composed, which are snffi- ciently larce to be visible to the eye. We must remark, however, that although these villi, as constituting the mouths of the lacteals, have been minutely described, and even finures given of the appearance which they exhibit in the microscope, yet that considerable doubt is still entertained of their existence, and tiiat they are even entirely discredited by some anatomists of the first eminence.* Upon the whole we may conclude that the opinion, which has been generally adopted, respecting the capillary termination of the lacteals, is somewhat theo- retical, rather derived from the supposed ne- cessity of such a formation to carry on the functions of the vessels, than from any actual observations that have been made upon them. V\'hen the lacteals have acquired suflicient magnitude to become visible to the eye, they are seen to proceed along the mesentery, the small vessels running together to form large branches, and these again forming others that are still larger, until the whole of them unite into a few main trunks, which terminate in the receptacle at the lower extremity of the thoracic duct.

In EUiotson's Physiol, ch. 9. p. 140.. 2, we have a "short account of the first discovery of the absorbent system." Sncmmer- ing's treatise, De Morbis Vasorum Absorb, con- tains a most ample and learned catalogue of the various works on absorption, from the earliest period to the date of its publication in 1795. * See Lieberkuhn, Diss, de Fabr.

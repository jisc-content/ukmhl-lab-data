CRUSTACEA. 765 the corresponding cord of the opposite side; after this the two form a single nerve, which by-and-by presents an enlargement having the appearance of a small median ganglion, and then remounts upon the dorsal aspect of the stomach to ramify there, and ultimately to lose itself upon the intestine (/()• Behind the stomach a transverse cord (/) is seen, which connects the two nervous filaments, and appears to be the cord of communication be- tween the ganglion of which mentfon has just been made, pushed backwards, in the same way as the ganglions themselves have been kept apart, to wit, by the resistance of the oesophagus, interposed at the time when that process is going on by which the pairs gene- rally are approximated in the course of the median line. The first of the thoracic nervous masses is oval-shaped, and gives origin to ten pairs of nerves, five of which issue from the anterior aspect. The first run to the mandibles and to their muscles; the second to the auditory apparatus ; the third to the first jaw, the fourth to the second jaw ; the fifth to the cells of the flancs, to the muscles and neighbouring inte- guments ; the sixth and seventh arise from the inferior aspect of the nervous mass to proceed to the maxillary feet; the nerves of the eighth pair are extremely slender, and are distributed to the muscles of the thorax ; the two succeed- ing pairs belong to the third pair of maxillary extremities; lastly, two cylindrical cords arise from the posterior extremity of this nervous centre, and connect it with the second thoracic ganglion, giving origin themselves in their passage to a pair of extremely minute filaments, which run to be distributed to the muscles of the thorax.' This first thoracic nervous mass represents, therefore, the five pairs of ganglions which follow the mandibular ring, and must be viewed as resulting from the concentration of the five pairs of medullary nuclei belonging to the five rings which bear the accessory masticatory or- gans. In the adult Lobster the different ele- mentary constituents are not traceable, and the whole mass appears to be composed of no more than two ganglions closely connected in the median plane; but in a species very nearly allied, namely, the River-crab (Astacus fluviatilis), very obvious traces of the existence of several medullary nuclei can always be demonstrated in its interior. The five pairs of ganglions that follow {f—i% and that belong to the five last thoracic rings, have, on the contrary, continued distinct; although simple, these nervous centres still exhibit manifest indi- cations of their composition severally by two nuclei; from either half we have a cord of communication sent off, similar to those which we have already pointed out as exist- ing between the first and second thoracic ganglions ; the whole of these inter-ganglionic cords are in contact along the median line, except the penultimate or antepenultimate pairs, which are separated from one another by the sternal artery, in the same manner as those of the head are kept asunder for the pas- sage of the oesophagus. Each of these five thoracic ganglions sends two pairs of nerves to the ambulatory extre- mities which correspond to them severally. Of these two nerves, the posterior and larger sends branches to the basilar articulations of the extremities; the anterior, again, distributes twigs to the muscles of the flancs; the two soon anastomose, and form a single trunk before penetrating into the extremity itself, which then traverses the whole limb, send- ing a branch to the muscles of each arti- culation. The abdominal ganglions (a'—a^) are smaller than the preceding ones, and are connected by simple longitudinal cords. They also supply two pairs of nerves, the one destined to the muscles of the abdomen, the other to the ap- pendages of the ring with which it corresponds. As in the thorax, nervous fibres, distributed to the median and superior part of the abdomen, are observed proceeding from the cords which establish a communication between one gan- glion and another. The last ganglion which appears to be made up of the medullary nuclei be- longing to the sixth and seventh segments of the abdomen, gives origin to four pairs of nerves, which run to the penultimate articu- lation of the abdomen, and to the last, which is of a flattened form, and along with the ap- pendages of the former constitutes the kind of horizontal oar which terminates this part of the body. Such is the nervous system in the Lobster. If we study it in the Palemon, we shall find precisely the same elements, but with a still higher degree of centralization, for the ganglia of the three lowest thoracic rings are conso- lidated into one, and situated much forwards, so that the nerves to which they give origin have to pursue a very oblique course, in order to reach the parts to which they are distributed respectively. The ganglion of the second pair is isolated ; that of the first pair of ambulatory extremities blends and is confounded with that of the third pair of maxillary limbs. The five anterior pairs of oesophageal ganglions, in fine, are united into a single nervous centre. There are consequently, properly speaking, no more than four medullary masses in the whole length of the cephalo-thoiacic portion of the Palemon; and even these are very close to one another, and all but united, their longi- tudinal commissures being thick and simple, and bearing as close a resemblance to constric- tions in a single nucleus as to bands of communication between distinct nuclei. The fourth of these four ganglions presents a longi- tudinal cleft through its centre, a structure which is easily explained by the presence at this point of the sternal artery, which existed there before the gang;lia became conjoined in the course of the median line, and necessarily opposed a merely mechanical obstacle to their entire union. In the Palinurus the whole of the thoracic

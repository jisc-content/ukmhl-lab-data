CAROTID ARTERY. the facial artery continues its course tipvvaids and inwards, and, opposite the commissure of the lips, gives off d, the superior labial coronary artery. This vessel passes inwards among the fibres of the orbicularis oris, runs above the free border of the upper lip nearer to its mucous membrane than to its cutaneous surface, gives branches to the various parts composing the upper lip, and meets the co- ronary of the opposite side, with which it very freely anastomoses. The superior labial coronary always sends off from the place where it anastomoses with that of the opposite side a branch, which ascends towards the septum of the nose, and which is called the artery of the septum of the nose, (arteria septi nasi.) The place of this artery is some- times occupied by two or more branches; it divides, near the septum of the nose, into at least two branches, which pass, one on either side, along the inferior border of the septum to the extremity of the nose, where it anasto- moses with branches of the lateral nasal : sometimes the superior coronary gives oft' a branch (ramus pimutUs), as it passes the a!a of the nose, to which, and the external part of the nostril, it is distributed. After the origin of the superior labial the facial artery is reduced to a very small size, and its continuation is by some called the external nasal, arteria nusalis externa com- munis. It continues to pass obliquely up- wards, forwards, and inwards under the levator labii superioris, to which it gives branches: after anastomosing with the infra-orbital artery and giving off" branches, which pass forward on the lateral surface of the nose, namely, e, luterules nasi, and /', dorsules nasi, which freely anastomose with each other, with the artery of the septum, and those of the opposite side on the dorsum of the nose, it emerges from between the two heads of the levator labii superioris, and becoming subcutaneous, ter- minates at the inner canthus of the eye by anastomosing with the termination of the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, at which place it has received the name of the angular artery. Irregularities of the labial or facial artery. It sometimes happens that the facial artery is smaller than usual, and terminates at the angle of the mouth or even below the situation of the usual origin of the inferior coronary; in this case the transverse facial branch of the temporal generally furnishes the branches which the coronary has failed to produce; on the other hand the labial artery is sometimes of a larger size than usual, as happens when it furnishes supernumerary branches, such as the ranine or sublingual. The facial artery is the principal source of communication between the superficial and deep branches of the external carotid by its anastomoses with the infra-orbital, nasal and dental arteries; and of the external carotid with the internal, by its anastomoses with the ophthalmic. Internal branch of the external carotid. Inferior pharyngeal artery, (a. pharyngea in- ferior V. ascendens,) arises commonly from the internal side of the external carotid close to its origin, sometimes from tlie bifurcation of the primitive carotid, more rarely from die internal carotid, and occasionally from the occipital; sometimes its place is supplied by the inferior palatine or by branches from the trunk of the facial; sometimes it is double, in which case only one of its branches arises from the external carotid, the other being furnished by one of the smaller arteries already mentioned, or by the internal carotid ; this artery is always the smallest branch of the external carotid; it passes perpendicularly upwards internal to the external carotid between the trunk of that vessel and the pharynx, lying on the rectus capitis anticus major muscle, and closely re- lated to the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. Having furnished branches from its inner side, both ascending and descending, to the constrictors of the pharynx and other muscles, which also supply the raucous mem- brane, and from its external side to the deep muscles of the neck, it terminates at the basis cranii, near the petrous portion of the temporal bone, by giving ofi'' its terminal branches, of whicli one, the proper pharyngeal, is princi- pally distributed to tlie parietes of the pharynx, and communicates by anastomosis with the inferior palatine from the superior thyroid ; a second, the posterior meningeal artery, enters the cranium by the foramen lacerum posterius, or by an opening in the vicinity of the condyle of the occipital bone, and is distributed to the dura mater lining the inferior occipital fossa: and a third ascends to the basis cranii, and per- forates the cartilaginous lamella, which fills up the foramen lacerum posterius, to enter the cranium and be distributed to the dura mater. Posterior brakches of the external CAROTID.—1st. The occipital artery (a. occi- pitalis) arises from the posterior side of the external carotid, opposite the lingual or the facial; it sometimes but rarely comes from the internal carotid ; it passes at first a little ob- liquely backwards along the lower border of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle ■which overlaps it; it crosses over the ninth pair of nerves which winds beneath it just at its origin, the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and spinal accessory nerve ; and passing backwards between the transverse pro- cess of the atlas and the mastoid process of the temporal bone it is lodged in a groove in this latter bone, which is internal to the inser- tion of the posterior belly of the digastric; it crosses the outer border of the rectus capitis lateralis muscle, and continuing its course beneath the sterno-cleido-mastoid, trache'.o- mastoid, splenius capitis and trapezius, and over the obliquus superior and complexus, it ascends tortuously over the superior part of the occipital bone, where it becomes cutaneous and anastomoses with branches from the tem- poral, posterior auris, and opposite occipital. The first branches of the occipital are small, and are distributed to the sterno-mastoid, di- gastric, and stylo-hyoid muscles, and to the lymphatic glands in the neighbourhood ; the branches which enter the sterno-mastoid are sometimes considerable, and anastomose freely

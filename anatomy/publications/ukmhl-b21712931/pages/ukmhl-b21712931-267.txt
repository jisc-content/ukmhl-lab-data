The marks of a trephine and catting instrument are seen. From a soldier, ast. twenty-one years. About a year previously a rifle-ball struck the leg at about the junction of the upper and middle thirds, and glanced down the bone. The wound remained open; and in the space of about 6 in. there were seven sinuses, with a foetid dis- charge. Did well after the operation. (Hospital, 111, 136.) 1863. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1318. Sequestrum, about 2 in. long, and apparently from the femur. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1319. Sequestrum, 3f in. long, and slender; from the interior of some long. bone. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1320. Necrosis of the head of the first metatarsal bone; prog- ress of disease very rapid. From a healthy lad, seventeen 3rears of age, who inflamed his foot by wearing a pair of new brogans, fron the 6th to the 10th of November.

It is smooth, though very irregular upon the inner surface; and there is very little disease of the bone about it. — The surface, external^, was red, with fistulae ; and the disease appeared to be superficial. 1856. Dr. H. J. Bigeloiv. 1322. A femur, that had been the seat of necrosis for about forty years. — From a man, fifty years of age. (Hospital, 69, 103.) Suppuration almost from the first, with occa- sional discharge of bone. Eight openings about lower part of thigh. Health feeble. Amputated, and did well. In the interior of the bone is a cavity, about 6 in. long, with large openings from it upon each side, but no dead bone ; several small pieces having been removed before the operation, and a large one before his entrance into the hospital. The bone shows the effects of chronic inflamma-

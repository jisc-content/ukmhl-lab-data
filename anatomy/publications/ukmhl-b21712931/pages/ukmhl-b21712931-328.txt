306 MORBID ANATOMY. pressed portion, tlie tables having nothing between them, and being themselves very thin, light was readily trans- mitted. Dr. W. has met with this form of atrophy in three other cases, and does not think it due to the action of the tendon of the occipito-frontalis muscle, as some have sup- posed. Cases are also referred to by Mr. Humphry in his work on the Skeleton (p. 142). The rounded form of the external nasal opening in this case was remarked upon by Dr. W., as showing well one of the characteristics of the negro skull. 1848. Dr. J. Wyman. 1538. Cast of a “ Calvarium, from Wenzel’s collection, Frank- fort ; ” showing the same change as the last. From the Phrenological collection. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1539. Parietal bone very thin, and of a light, earthy structure. 1847> Dr. J. G. Warren. 1540. Several ribs much atrophied, and several of them anchy- losed to a small extent. Several fractures are also seen, which are very imper- fectly if at all united ; no new bone being thrown out about them. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1541. Upper portion of an adult humerus sawed lengthwise; a very fine specimen of interstitial atrophy. The walls are very thin; and the bony fibres within, so far as they ex- tend, very delicate and peculiarly arranged. 1859. 1542. The os innominatum, femur, tibia, and fibula of a young adult, preserved in connection. The bones are sufficiently long, but so remarkably light and slender, smooth and rounded, as to suggest the idea of the bones of a bird; the roughnesses that characterize the muscular attachments being scarcely seen. On section, the walls of the femui are extremely thin, though compact; and within the bone is almost entirely hollow, as in a bird. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1543. Tarsal bones of full size, but extremely light, as they not unfrequently are in cases of disease of the knee-joint,

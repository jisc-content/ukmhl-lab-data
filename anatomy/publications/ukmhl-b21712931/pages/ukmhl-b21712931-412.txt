Aug. 24th, 1867, the patient fractured his arm and fore- arm, and amputation was performed below the elbow. Nov. 10th he entered the hospital (134, 84), with pain shooting up from the stump, anteriorly and posteriorly; and on the 7th of Dec. a second amputation was performed at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the hume- rus. The wound suppurated ; and on tbe 28th of January, when it had nearly or quite healed, he reported that he had had for some days a deep-seated pain in the middle of the humerus, which was the seat of the fracture. This pain continued to be so severe, that on the 22d of Feb. a third amputation was performed at the upper part of the bone ; and the musculo-spiral nerve was found caught between the fragments of the broken bone, so that it could not be withdrawn, as shown in the second specimen. Both speci- mens are preserved in spirit, and show the connection of the nerves with the cicatrix below the elbow, and with the fractured humerus. 1868. Dr. H. J. Bigelow.

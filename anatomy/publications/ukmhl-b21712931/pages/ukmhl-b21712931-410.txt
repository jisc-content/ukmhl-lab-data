Convulsions, with coma, came on at last, and she died in the course of the day. 1867. Dr. C. Ellis. 1900. Cancerous growth, from the outer surface of dura mater. (See No. 1512.) 1859. ‘ Dr. C. Ellis. 1901. An extensive, epithelial, cancerous growth, from the outer surface of the dura mater. From a man, who was an exhibitor of wild animals. At about the age of two years the top of his head was severely burned, and bone came away, leaving an opening about an inch in diameter. From that time there was a constant discharge until about seven years before his death, when a grizzly bear tore his scalp down over his eyes. His head then healed, and continued so until two years before death, when a “ man-monkey ” clawed, bit, and tore it open again. The epithelial disease then appeared, rose an inch above the surrounding surface, and looked like the crest of a fowl; the extent being 4 by 3£ in. Pain, hemorrhage, con- vulsions, and at last hemiplegia were the consequences. The bone was extensively destroyed (No. 1525) ; and an abscess was found in the brain beneath the seat of the disease.

The patient was a man, forty-seven years of age, who had had a tumor there for twenty-four years; and, two years before his entrance into the hospital (77, 189.), a mass, weighing 2 lbs., had been removed. The disease having returned, Dr. B. amputated the arm at the shoulder- joint. The ulnar nerve entered the upper part of a laro-e cancerous tumor, and just before it was lost in it bulged out to the size of a sparrow’s egg.

MORBID ANATOMY. 609 2832. Cast of a very large and purely encephaloid breast, about 6 in. by 3 in. in diameter. The patient was a single, middle-aged, healthy-looking Irishwoman, and the duration of the disease was two years. The structure was moderately firm, whitish, and semitranslucent; section flat; some xanthoid; no strise, fibres, nor milk-tubes. About four years afterward the mass was again removed by Dr. Gay, and was then about two-thirds as large as before. 1861. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. SERIES XXXVI. —GENITAL ORGANS OF THE MALE. I. Scrotum.

A perfectly defined, rounded abscess, of the size of a nutmeg, and situated in a thick, dense, fibrous tissue, that closely invests the testicle, and is from £ in. to 1 in. in thickness. It is thickly lined with recent lymph, and was filled, when recent, with thick, greenish pus. The testicle is health}'.

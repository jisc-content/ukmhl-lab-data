63 HEALTHY ANATOMY. 650. The same ; dried and preserved in turpentine. 1847. Dr. J. O. Warren. 651. The same ; foetal. By Dr. D. 1860. Dr. S. Durkee. 652. Portion of small intestine, dried, and showing an unusual development of the follicles of Peyerâ€™s patches. From a case of malignant cholera. One of the patches is elliptical, as usual, and very long. Two others are circular, and not more than three or four lines in diameter. In this last form they are occasionally found at the lower end of the ileum, and as often in any other part of the circumference of the intestine, as opposite to the mesentery. When these small patches exist, and are ulcerated in typhoid fever, the mistake might very readily be made of supposing that the ulcers were in the mucous membrane, and not in the patches, for want of a knowledge of the above fact. 1857.

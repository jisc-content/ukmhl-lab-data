80 HEALTHY ANATOMY. 758£. The same, from the cow. 1861. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 759. Gravid uterus ; about the third month. A wax prepara- tion. External organs also shown. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 760. Uterus, with placenta attached; last month of preg- • nancy. 1861. 760£. The same, with the foetus ; about the seventh month. 1861. 761. The same; three to four months. Neck quite undevel- • oped. The foetus was plump, and rather larger than the forefinger ; and the uterus rose nearly to the brim of the pelvis. The decidua appeared, in the recent state, as if somewhat tubercular; the patient having had obstinate vomiting, from the time of conception, but finally dying from something intermediate between pneumonia and tu- bercular disease of the lungs. 1861. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 761£. Uncontracted uterus, from a woman who died of hemor- • rhage, 1£ hours after labor, at the full period. 1855. Dr. Ezra Palmer. 762. Decidua vera, remarkably entire, and inverted so as to show the comparatively smooth free surface. For the ovum, see No. 771. 1857. Dr. John P. Reynolds. 763. A second specimen, 3 in. in length, and still more com- plete. The shape is that of the fundus and body of an enlarged uterus. Outer surface rough, as usual, and the inner comparatively smooth. At the fundus, but rather on one side, is seen an ovum, that must have been about as large as an English walnut, and which has been opened by a crucial incision; parietes thin, as if blighted, and invested by the decidua reflexa; there being no appear- ance of the villosities of the chorion, embryo or cord. The mass came away with much hemorrhage, but without the woman’s knowledge, and recovery was rapid. She con- sidered herself as two or two and one-half months preg- nant ; and had already aborted once within a }'ear. 1862. Dr. John G. Blake.

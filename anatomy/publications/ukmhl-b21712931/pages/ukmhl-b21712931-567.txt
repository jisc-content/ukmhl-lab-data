545 MORBID ANATOMY. of ammonia and oxalate of lime. 2" 10'" by 1" 8"'. Human? 2570. Ox. of lime, mixed with ur. of ammonia and ur. ac. Spherical. 9'" by 8"'. 2571. Fragment of stone; ox. of lime, ur. of ammonia, and a little ur. ac. Cavity in centre, filled with much organic matter, as epithelium, etc. Size originally 1" 2'" by 1". 2572. Spherical, tubercular calculus, showing beautiful changes of color and arrangement. The inner portion consists of ur. ac., ur. of ammonia, and ur. and ox. of lime. This is followed by a remarkably compact and colored deposition of ox. of lime, of a stellated form, which is succeeded by a more regular layer of ox. lime, ur. ac. and ur. of lime. Diameter 2" V". 2573. An irregular, tetrahedral and coarsely lobulated calcu- lus. Centre very dark, and composed of ox. of lime, ur. ac. and urates of ammonia and lime. Contains many cavities filled with coagula and epithelium. Outer portion formed by ox. of lime, uric acid and ur. of lime. 1" 7" by 1" 3"'. Both halves preserved. 2574. Large, irregular, gourd-shaped calculus, composed of regularly concentric layers of ur. ac., ur. of ammonia, and ox. of lime. Its constricted form is owing to attrition or erosion; it having been originally spherical in shape. Exterior also shows signs of erosion. 2" 10'" bv 1" 10'". J 2575. Peculiar calculus approaching the pyriform in shape externally. The body is composed of ur. ac. and ur. of ammonia; the dense cortex of ox. of lime. Exterior polished at one extremity, and of a greenish-brown hue; the other eroded apparently and of a paler color. 1" 9"' by 1" 3'". 2576. Bioad, oval calculus, made up of loosely adherent, con- centric laminrn of ur. ac. and ur. of ammonia, with a little ox. of lime. Centre, yellowish red. The exterior, like man} others in this collection, shows marks of the action of solvents within the bladder. 1" 6"' by 1" 3'". 2577. Bioad, flattened, ovoid ; resembling in color, structure of 35

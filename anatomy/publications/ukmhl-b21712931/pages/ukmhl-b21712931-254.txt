MOKBID ANATOMY. 232 On dissection, the sinuses were found to open freely into the cavity of the joint, and there was pus amongst the muscles of the thigh; but no other disease, excepting a granulated liver. 1847. Dr. G. Hayward. 1271. Knee-joint, with the surrounding soft parts; in spirit; • and showing a cavity nearly 5 in. in length, between the head of the tibia and the fibula, the inner surface of which is partly smooth, and partly rough, as from coagulated blood. Tibia extensively carious. 1847. Dr. J. 0. Warren. 1272. Head of the tibia, showing several deep and defined ca- rious cavities beneath the articular surface; the interven- ing portions of this last being nearly smooth. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1273. Caries of the tibia, and very much as in the last case, except that it is less deep and extensive. Some periosteal deposit. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1274. Superficial caries of the shaft of the tibia, to the extent of 3£ in. Some appearances of exfoliation, and the bone is very much in the condition in which it would haA e been if there had been an extensive and thin exfoliation, such as is seen to be going on in No. 1295. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1275. A portion of the leg, preserved entire in spirit, and • showing an ulcer 6J in. in length, covered with large gran- ulations, and extending to such a depth that the tibia must be in part mostly, if not entirely, destroyed. The fibula seems to be anchyloscd to the tibia below the disease. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1276. Lower half of the fibula, much and very irregularly en- larged, with two large and deep cavities. Structure rather solid than otherwise. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1277. Caries of the body of the astragalus, with necrosis. Upper and lower articular surfaces also carious, but not the anterior. Os calcis preserved, and is considerably dis- eased. Structure very light. From a man,set. forty-seven (Hospital, 78, 141). Dis-

C. Warren. 1462. Cast of a skull, showing a most remarkable development of tumors upon the surface. The lower jaw is surrounded by them upon the outer surface. There is also one below each orbit, one about the left zygoma, and a small one some way above the left ear. From the Phrenological Collection. A similar cast is in the Dupuytren Museum at Paris; and, the curator, having been applied to for information in legaid to it, stated that the case is at least a hundred years old, and that there is no clue to its history. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1463. Exostosis from the back part of the upper jaw; smooth, rounded, about the size of a horse-chestnut, and contained two molar teeth. The patient was a clergyman, and the tumor, which was of six years’ duration, had troubled him only mechanically. Removed by bone forceps ; and the patient did well. 1868. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 1464.

Three years previously, he fell upon the ice, struck Ins forehead, and just afterward a tumor appeared, that, on admission, extended from the left temple to just beyond the median line, and from the roots of the hair downward into the orbit. The eye protruded, and was dis- p aced downward and outward. The tumor was 5 in. by “ dloaraeter’ and protruded 2£ in. Integument not affected. Surface uniformly smooth, but with an imper- fectly marked division into a frontal and an orbital por- lon. e t bony and immovable, except at one or two points where there was an elasticity, as from a thin, bony cyst.

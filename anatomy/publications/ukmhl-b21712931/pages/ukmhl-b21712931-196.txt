MORBID ANATOMY. 174 face, marking the separation of the coronoid process and the olecranon, extending almost longitudinally 3 J in. down- wards, and detaching from the shaft that portion of the bone to which the olecranon was attached. Dr. H. remarked that there are very few recorded cases of longitudinal fracture of the head of the radius ; and, of those 'that he had found, three were associated with the rare accident of fracture of the coronoid process of the ulna ; and the present specimen shows that this also might have been a fracture of the coronoid process, had the split which passed down the shaft of the ulna terminated ante- riorly' (towards which aspect it inclined, and came nearest) instead of posteriorly. 1766. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1032. Old fracture of the lower half of the radius and ulna. Lower fragments inclined outward. From a female dissecting-room subject, fifty years of age, or more. The femur was also fractured. No. 1082. 1865. Dr. Wm. C. B. Fifield, of Dorchester. 1033. Oblique fracture of the radius, at the junction of the middle and upper third. The muscles of the whole arm were atrophied, and rotation of the forearm considerably impaired. Fracture very firmly united, though so irregu- larly as to prevent rotation of the bone. Upper fragment so twisted upon the lower, that the surfaces of the two are not in the same plane, and the bicipital tuberosity is con- sequently displaced outwards. There is also upon the up- per surface of the head of the bone a small fractal e, of t size of a tliree-cent piece, superficial, united with icmai - able evenness, without any sign of inflammation, and marked by a defined outline. 1856-^ ^ 1034- Old fracture of the ulna Just below the imdd^of the bone; union regular. 1847. o. ^ 1035 The lower extremity of tire radius, showing a stellate mac! of tire articular surface, and extending upwards for “°FromThM^tal patient, who died from other injuries.

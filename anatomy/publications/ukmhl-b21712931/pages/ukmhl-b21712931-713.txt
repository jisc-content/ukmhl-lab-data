The wound soon very nearly healed ; but an abscess formed behind the ear and discharged ; and there was once a discharge of pus from the meatus.

For a time the urine passed altogether through the wounded bladder, and with it what appeared to be fcecal matter from the small intes- tine ; but this gradually diminished.

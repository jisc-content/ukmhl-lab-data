MORBID ANATOMY. 260 it is quite gone. Laminae and art. processes fused. Pos- sibly the result of a crushing down of the bodies by exter- nal violence. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1392. Fusion of the bodies and laminae of the second and third cervical vertebrae; probably the result of inflammation, that was soon arrested. From a middle-aged woman. 1854. Dr. L. M. Sargent. 1393. Four cervical vertebrae, of which the bodies and articu- lar processes, and upon the left side the laminae are anchy- losed. No curvature. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1394. Three dorsal, and three lumbar vertebrae; articulated. From a case of aneurism of the aorta ; and within the cav- ity of which the bones were in part denuded. Bodies ca- rious to a small extent; the cancelli being exposed. 1858. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1395. Absorption, by aneurism, of a large part of the bodies of two lumbar vertebrae. 1867. Dr. C. Ellis. 1396. Upper half of the humerus, showing the results of old disease, and probably inflammation of the joint. The head and neck are entirely destroyed; and the articular surface, if it may be so called, is rough, though nowhere carious. The bone generally is curved and misshapen, but sound in structure. From a man, thirty-six years of age, who died of internal disease (Hospital, 210, 3) ; and “ for three years has had occasional pain in each shoulder, with some in the other joints.” The appearances are not at all those of “ chronic rheumatic arthritis.” 1857. Dr. C. Ellis. 1397. Bones of the elbow-joint, showing superficial caries of the articular surfaces. From a young subject. 1 he joint was swollen, with limited motion, and an external fistula leading to it. The bones are light and porous. 1859. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1398. Disorganization of the left elbow-joint; the result, prob- ably, of some old disease. The portion of the humerus that usually articulates with the ulna is almost destroyed ; and of the inner condyle not a trace remains. rlhe re- maining portion, which is partly rough and partly ebur-
